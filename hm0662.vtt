Hey folks. You're a very
good developer, probably regardless. You

2
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.020
do write bugs. That's unavoidable.
What is affordable is wasting

3
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.630
time trying to track down
the cause of those bugs

4
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.070
century.io provides full stack error
tracking that lets you monitor

5
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.860
and fix problems. In real
time, you can see the

6
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.010
severity and the scope of
the error. Get immediate access

7
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.620
to the stack, trace connect
the problem to the commit

8
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.190
that caused it and fix
it without delay century. It's

9
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.050
a name so common that
they have to include the

10
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.180
top level domain in their
advertising to make sure you

11
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.970
remember it. century.io, that century
dot I O open source,

it, they can make it

14
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.300
far easier to fix any

century.io. <inaudible>. Hi, this is
Scott Hanselman. This is another

17
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.280
episode of Hanselminutes today. I'm
talking to Febby on SoundCloud,

18
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.980
who has written a wonderful
book called the game engine.

19
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.910
Blackbook for doom. And I'm
sitting here with this book

20
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.360
in front of me, filled
with highlights. I've been reading

21
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.220
this book and highlighting so
many pages and I'm so

22
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.330
excited to chat with you
today, sir. Oh, thank you

23
00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.510
for having me. This is
such an interesting idea. You've

24
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.870
written both the game engine
black book for doom, and

25
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.970
then previously wrote one for
Wolfenstein three D and I

26
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.210
was, my wife saw me
reading this yesterday and she

27
00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.770
said, are you studying? Because
she saw diagrams and photographs

28
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.990
and full color and code
and, and she thought it

29
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.330
was studying for some kind
of a test. And I

30
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.940
was telling her what a
joy it was to explore

31
00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.380
the last 25 years of
doom. I'm glad, I'm glad

32
00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.380
you enjoyed it. That's exactly.
That's part of why I

33
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.530
wrote it. Part of it
was a nostalgia and allow

34
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.230
people to leave again, that,
that era. So this is

35
00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:11.450
a doom is 25 years
old this year, is it?

36
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.400
Yeah. On December 10th of this
year, I turned 25 years

37
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.320
old. It was raised on
December 10th, 1993. And you have written

38
00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.070
a, an over 400 page
full color book as if

39
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.510
I may a love letter
to, to doom, to CarMax,

40
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.180
to the, to everyone that
worked on this project. It's,

41
00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.270
it's extraordinary. This must have
taken a very long time.

42
00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.380
No, actually this one, this
one went pretty fast. I

43
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.350
wrote it pretty much in
six months. Then I, I

44
00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.530
left it and touched for
a while too, so I

45
00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.430
could proofread it with new
eyes and it was a

46
00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.480
pretty fast pace. It's a
love radio, but it's also

47
00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.620
thank you later for all
what I've learned or what

48
00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.460
I've been able to do
with the source code And

49
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.530
or what is game as
brought to my life. That's

50
00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.510
amazing that you're, that you're
saying that you, it was

51
00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.720
a pretty quick, right? Because
I, I, I don't want

52
00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.910
people to think, Oh, he,
he wrote this book in

53
00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.850
six months and it must,
you know, a year there's

54
00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.430
so much detail. Why was
it easy to write? Was

55
00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.860
it just because it floated
out Review? One of the

56
00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.750
reason is that first of
all, I had all the

57
00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.290
tools really, before that day
we wrote a book about

58
00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.620
warfare string 3d. This one
was a hell. I gave

59
00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.910
up three times over the
course of three years, trying

60
00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.140
to make it happen. It
was very difficult. This one,

61
00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.420
it was like a really
well set up a framework

62
00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.940
and all of the content,
pretty much I had it

63
00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.900
in my head because I've
been writing about doom. Some

64
00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.660
of the technique used in
the game like binary space,

65
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:57.270
petition TechSoup mapping and all
those things. So it wasn't

66
00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:01.260
really, really hard. And especially
because it also followed the

67
00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.160
same structure as the first
book, which is first has

68
00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.590
described the environment, the hardware.
And then I described the

69
00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.950
team and the tools they
built and finally a dive

70
00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.450
in to the code and
the engine. So that was

71
00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.690
pretty easy in comparison to
the previous one. And you'd

72
00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.970
put together your own production
pipeline, because this is a

73
00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:29.010
self published book that you
wrote in latex. Yeah, everything

74
00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:34.290
was right in by hand
with Lennox, sibling, text editor,

75
00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.250
and escape for the drawings.
That's fantastic. One of the

76
00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.990
things that I was a
little surprised about when I

77
00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.920
had my expectations, when I
bought it, was that there

78
00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.070
would be, I would be
reading code within the first

79
00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.930
page, but interestingly, there's almost
a hundred pages of, of

80
00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.270
context. This isn't a book
about code. It's a book

81
00:04:54.270 --> 00:05:00.060
about history, about teams, about
schedules. Yes, it's very important.

82
00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:05.340
So that's something that was
even more vivid when I

83
00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.740
wanted to talk about what
Finch thing is that even

84
00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.660
though you had the source
code, if you don't know

85
00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.710
about what was the hardware,
what was the constraint at

86
00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.800
the time? It means almost
nothing. So that's why I

87
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.000
spent a lot of time
describing everything. So without being

88
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.330
too technical, for example, the
46 was a new CPU

89
00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.770
at the time that was
using Acacia cash line technology

90
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:31.500
to make things faster. And
if you, if you're not

91
00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.630
aware of that, when you
ring the doom source code,

92
00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.990
anyway, things are organized the
way they are. You don't

93
00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.260
really understand why it's done
this way. That's so important

94
00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.110
to point out because people
who were, who may not

95
00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.900
have been around or been
aware of this in 1989

96
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.560
to 1992, there was a
lot of happening with floating

97
00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.810
point processors and the SX
versus DX 46, the decisions

98
00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:58.040
that the doom team would
have needed to make, they

99
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.070
could have found themselves without
a processor to run their

100
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.260
app, or they would have
made the, you know, they

101
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.050
would have targeted the wrong
instruction set and put themselves

102
00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.220
in a bad situation. Absolutely.
Yeah. I agree with that.

103
00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:12.970
And it's even more important
to know a day where

104
00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:16.690
I feel like a developer
as more mine, more remote

105
00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:20.680
from the hardware. Typically, if
you, if you write something

106
00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:26.590
in JavaScript on Chrome, you're
running inside of VM, which

107
00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.770
is a process on top
of an operating system. And

108
00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:34.330
even that is sometime virtualized
somehow. And we're so far

109
00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:39.370
remote that we don't really
factor in the limitation. Sometime

110
00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:44.350
we program and assume we
have limitless limitless resources like

111
00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:49.330
infinite CP power or infinite
Ram. Whereas when you program

112
00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:51.970
in this era for doom
and one French 10, you

113
00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:55.360
had to have specific budgets
in term of Ram in

114
00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.580
terms of CPU cycle, you
were willing to spend on

115
00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:01.660
different parts of the rendering
pipeline. Yeah. It's that working

116
00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:05.110
within constraints. It's a very
different type of programming thinking

117
00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:08.860
about memory, but not just
that thinking about how many

118
00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:12.490
processor instructions thinking about ticks.
They had a series of

119
00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:15.460
constraints that they decided upon.
They said, this has to

120
00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:19.060
work in four megs of
Ram. You know, they had

121
00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:21.970
minimum specs. One of the
things I thought was interesting

122
00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:24.520
was you said that there
was a controversial decision about

123
00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:27.430
the number of ticks that
they could work within, that

124
00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:32.020
allowed them to achieve some
things, but also caused them

125
00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:35.500
problems later. What was that
controversial decision? Oh, so is

126
00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:41.080
a, hard-coded the frame rate
at 35 Hertz. And so

127
00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:42.670
later on, he led to
a problem that if any,

128
00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:45.130
if your machine can render
a 70 frame per second,

129
00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:48.730
because the ward only update
that's 35 Hertz, you only

130
00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:53.640
see 35 movement per, per,
per second. So that solved

131
00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:57.880
a lot of the issues
because you could play the

132
00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:03.400
game on any computer and
at the same world ticks.

133
00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:08.590
But later on, when Pentium
came out, which were most

134
00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:12.310
Fest on machine, they could
not really run out of

135
00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:17.350
the food potential because they
were limited. So the idea

136
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:19.570
that you would somehow get
a faster machine and get

137
00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:22.420
four times more frame rate,
or, you know, four times

138
00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:24.700
more, what something, it didn't,
it didn't scale in the

139
00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:27.280
way that we think of
modern game engine scaling in

140
00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.860
the sense of scaling up.
But it did scale down

141
00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:34.210
extraordinarily. It did scale down
and it did scale, but

142
00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:38.580
to a certain extent, because
if any, when they released

143
00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:42.070
the game, no one machine
could run as 35 Hertz.

144
00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:47.050
So must machine, well running
a 20 so later on

145
00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:49.420
pension were about to reach
certify, which was still very

146
00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:54.370
pleased, pleasant visually. But even
now, today, when you look

147
00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:57.900
at a model, you can
games, you can have games

148
00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:01.470
running at a thousand frames
per second, but even the

149
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:04.650
money tall, the display is
going to remain at 60

150
00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:08.550
or sure. Lucky, 120. So
you still have a limiting

151
00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:11.870
factor. That's right. That's right.
One of the things I

152
00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:14.540
also thought was interesting, and
I love that you actually

153
00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:20.720
found use net posts from
1994 with people, and you

154
00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:25.040
included their actual emails arguing
about whether or not doom

155
00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:28.520
ran faster with a floating
point coprocessor on a 46

156
00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:31.580
DX or an ESX. And
there was a lot, even

157
00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:33.440
then on the internet, there's
a lot of fake news.

158
00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:36.050
No one, no one could
decide whether it was better

159
00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:38.930
with this process or a
better with that one. Yeah.

160
00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:43.970
I wouldn't make me call
it fake news because it's

161
00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:48.780
nothing intentional of credit. It's
so representative of the era,

162
00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:51.530
I know how hard it
was to access the information.

163
00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:56.650
John Carmack mentions it later
on in the book, when

164
00:09:56.670 --> 00:10:00.560
he was doing computer graphics
research, he has very, very

165
00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:04.190
little access to resources and
everything was limited. Back in

166
00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:07.850
the days, we are almost
the same age. And maybe

167
00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:11.600
you try to program back
in the nineties, a compiler

168
00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:14.930
was a thousand dollars. It
was something really hard to

169
00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:17.990
access. So information, even the
tuning was how to access

170
00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.900
The, the idea that tooling
was how to access. It

171
00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:23.630
looks when you look at
the historical context here, it

172
00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:26.960
almost makes me wonder how
we got anything done. You

173
00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:30.950
actually include a, a table
of prices and you are

174
00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:33.320
kind enough to show us
what it would cost to

175
00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:36.110
buy computers. Now, some of
the workstations that they were

176
00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:39.710
using would be 12 or
$15,000 today, but I can't

177
00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:42.740
imagine someone tolerating that kind
of to buy a computer

178
00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:45.950
today. Well, you know, I'm
pretty sure in 20 years,

179
00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:49.280
people are gonna say the
same thing about now. And

180
00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.700
it's true for all time
periods. Some people would say,

181
00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:55.970
we're crazy to buy phones
at our thousand dollars yet.

182
00:10:55.970 --> 00:11:00.020
We still do. Mm that's
true. That's true. They, they

183
00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:03.530
were targeting ultimately to start
the PC, which was a

184
00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:07.400
business machine. So they had
the challenge of graphics cards

185
00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.530
and a machine that was
used to pushing text around

186
00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:12.620
to start pushing graphics around,
but they didn't develop on

187
00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:15.850
the PC. Right? No, as
they did not develop on

188
00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:19.280
a PC, that was one
of the big decisions they

189
00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:24.770
made self-aware as they actually
developed everything on next workstation,

190
00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:28.580
which was manufactured by my
next company created by Steve

191
00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:33.690
jobs in 1989. And this
was a, you know, a

192
00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:36.950
real workstation, this was a
revolutionary computer. This is one

193
00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:39.620
of the computers that a
lot of historians feel like

194
00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:42.200
it should have succeeded in
taking over the world. But

195
00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:46.790
it didn't, even though it's,
you can find it's it's

196
00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:51.530
influencing code even on the
iPhone today. Well, yes, I

197
00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:54.850
D I actually disagree. I
think it failed and rightfully

198
00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:57.460
so because it was, Oh,
I think you'd always have

199
00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:02.500
a price. The operating system
was gorgeous, so many innovation

200
00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:06.340
and it worked very well
and he still still walks

201
00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:11.440
because it's at the heart
of microwaves now. But I

202
00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:15.430
think maybe Steve jobs in
his quest for perfection, I

203
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:18.190
think on this one, he
probably took it too far.

204
00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:23.610
Yeah. A and 12, $12,000
in 1991 was a nontrivial

205
00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:26.160
amount of money for a
next year Cube, especially when

206
00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:29.800
you should consider it could
only render for Carlos. Actually

207
00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:32.550
it would only rent out
black, white, and two shades

208
00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:36.810
of gray, but it was
so high resolution. It was

209
00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:40.590
very high resolution, but I
don't know. I think it's

210
00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:44.880
very interesting. The chosen he
made. So to write his

211
00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:49.400
book actually acquired an external
colo station. Really? Oh yeah.

212
00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:52.980
I wanted to experience the,
the, the, the real pipeline,

213
00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:55.440
how long it took to
compile ho it was to,

214
00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:59.760
to code on this machine.
And what surprised me is

215
00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:03.780
that it's not surely able
to run random properly. If

216
00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:08.640
you start, if you start
doom on the next station,

217
00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:12.900
it's gonna run a 10
frame per second. So really

218
00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.570
once it got out of
the next station was the

219
00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:19.590
stability of the, the TextEdit
or the off object you

220
00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:24.420
see, because developing the tools
was much faster, but it

221
00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:27.840
was a at first sight,
it's not abuse that it's

222
00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:30.870
going to be a machine
done to develop first person

223
00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:33.480
shooter. I was impressed at
you. And you, you include

224
00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:35.790
some screenshots that are like,
you must have taken them

225
00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:39.000
yourself that show the, you
know what, it, would've looked

226
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.700
like to develop it on
dos at, you know, 80

227
00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:44.370
by 25 or 80 by
50. And then you put

228
00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:46.650
it next to what it
looks like on next it's,

229
00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:50.280
it's almost as if they,
they picked the next simply

230
00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:51.960
because they wanted to see
more lines of code in

231
00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:56.040
the screen, which I know
is an oversimplification To some

232
00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:59.370
extent. It's true. The main
reason to come back mention

233
00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:04.380
is that he didn't crash
all the time. Reportedly we'd

234
00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:08.460
lose all his work several
times a day. And back

235
00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:10.920
in the day 82, I
did not save it to

236
00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:14.250
magically. So imagine yourself, working
on an algorithm for an

237
00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:17.520
hour and losing it all,
I can see why they

238
00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:23.670
were motivated to change. Today's
sponsor is tiny technologies. If

239
00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:26.700
you're a developer who needs
to build beautiful writing experiences

240
00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:29.820
for your end users, then
check out tiny. You may

241
00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:33.480
recognize the name. Tiny MCE

WordPress. And it LaSeon. And
it's used by thousands of

244
00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:44.220
businesses like IBM, Adobe Intel,
the NASDAQ visa, and the

245

1 million users on the tiny
cloud. They also recently launched

247
00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:56.360
a cloud asset management system
called tiny drive, and they

248
00:14:56.360 --> 00:15:00.740
will soon release a rearchitected
UI called tiny MCE five

249
00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:04.160
to meet the needs of
today's content creators. So go

So you, you describe in

252
00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:19.070
great detail, the pipeline here.
It's interesting that they are

253
00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:22.460
building on a Motorola, but
they're targeting an Intel. So

254
00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:25.100
they even, the, the ND
in this is different between

255
00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:31.030
the two processors. Yeah. The
everything was different on those.

256
00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:34.000
You had access to the
hardware on next. You had

257
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.720
to use a whatever frameworks
we're using. You cannot access

258
00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:42.700
the screen directly. Same thing
for the keyboard. The timer

259
00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:45.970
is not the same. Everything
is different that worked to

260
00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:49.780
the drums advantages in a
long time, because there is

261
00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:51.880
a, the way do me
structure is that there is

262
00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:56.830
a core and you have
subsystem, which are very cleanly,

263
00:15:56.830 --> 00:16:00.700
layered. There is, there are
no layer of violations. So

264
00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:02.560
to get out or to
get in, you have to

265
00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:06.670
go through those subsidized system.
Everything is very clearly defined.

266
00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:10.300
And that's why I do
more so easy to portlet

267
00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:13.420
around towards M platform. Because
the only work you have

268
00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:16.630
to do is to rewrite
a Steiny subsystem and all

269
00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:19.750
the remaining core remain an
effective. So it was very

270
00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:25.960
much an example of a
single responsibility principle. Yeah. It's

271
00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:28.900
interesting that on the first
preface where you get there

272
00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:32.140
and John Carmack, his first
sentence is that doom was

273
00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:36.610
almost, or effectively the perfect,
the perfect game. And I

274
00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:39.400
thought to myself, Oh, that's
a little bit egotistical, but

275
00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:41.170
then you read the book
and you go, well, it

276
00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:43.750
kind of was the perfect
schedule, perfect storm per I

277
00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:46.600
mean like just the whole
team came together to make

278
00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:48.700
something that, you know, while
it's shipped with a bugger

279
00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:52.330
to has held up 25
years later as really just

280
00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:55.900
the perfect game. I agree
with that. I don't think

281
00:16:55.900 --> 00:17:01.690
it's, I'm showing up if
annual general Ramiro wrote in

282
00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:04.840
his interview, that the game
turned out exactly the way

283
00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:09.850
you want it. And the
game felt very solid, very

284
00:17:09.850 --> 00:17:14.020
fast. The engine was yeah.
Close to perfection. I would

285
00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:16.960
say to me, it's the
best games ever produced. <inaudible>

286
00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:21.820
I wonder if people today,
if my kids, if people

287
00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:23.710
who are in their twenties
are people who are younger

288
00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:27.820
than doom is what they
will experience that will cause

289
00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:30.580
them to have that kind
of, that visceral feeling in

290
00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:33.880
their chest. Like, Oh my
goodness. Like when I saw

291
00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:37.000
Wolf and Stein, you could
have knocked me over with

292
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.390
a feather and then doom
the, the walls were not

293
00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:43.840
just square. I mean, it
was so unbelievable. We hadn't

294
00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:46.540
seen anything like it. What
is the next thing for

295
00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:49.110
that? When it in 2020
or 2025, that's going to

296
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:52.530
knock over my son or
my daughter with a feather.

297
00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:56.030
I'm not sure it's going
to be based on technology.

298
00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:00.830
I think that a lot
of good games, the design

299
00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:03.140
is much more important. Now
I think we are reaching

300
00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:05.870
a point where the graphic
is not really improving anymore.

301
00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.830
Maybe it will come to
VR personality. I have a

302
00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:12.470
hard time with VR because
I get motion sickness. Yeah.

303
00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:14.840
It's really hard to tell
where it's going to go.

304
00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:19.180
What's remarkable though, is that
to me still enjoyable now

305
00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:23.380
today, the technology is obsolete,
but the game play is

306
00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:26.060
still there. It's still face
space game with a lot

307
00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:29.660
of secret. And that's the
genius of the designer of

308
00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:32.360
the game. And you've spent
some time talking about how

309
00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:34.610
they design the levels, how
much work was put into

310
00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:36.680
it. And if you look
at the, the amount of

311
00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:41.090
work spent on doom dot
exe versus the wad files,

312
00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:45.110
the, you know, where's all
the data files. It really

313
00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:47.120
is kind of, is it
the first example of an

314
00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:50.960
engine with that? You could
then create unlimited content with

315
00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:54.590
No, we've all finished to
us already, already an engine.

316
00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:57.890
It was just much harder
to access. I don't think

317
00:18:57.890 --> 00:19:00.680
they were as open as
aware were we've we've Wharf.

318
00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:05.180
When did they? So what
fan made we've Wolfenstein, Zay

319
00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:11.030
intentionally created an archives farm
outs, which would be easy

320
00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:16.970
to modify. And if any
interim house press release the

321
00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:20.450
premise, an open game where
they will publish the specs

322
00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:25.490
of the assets format And
they publish the source code

323
00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:27.680
just a few years later,
four years after it came

324
00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:29.810
out, this is so innovative.
These are the kinds of

325
00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:32.750
things people do now. And
in 20, in the 2010s,

326
00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:36.080
the 20 fifteens to be
doing that 25 years ago,

327
00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:38.720
to be that progressive and
thoughtful with your code, with

328
00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:42.140
your assets and with your
data format is, is extraordinary.

329
00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:45.380
That was extraordinary. And to
me, that's the true spirit

330
00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:50.540
of people who, who love
programming. You, you share what

331
00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:52.550
you know, and you're, you
just don't keep it. You

332
00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:56.710
don't keep it for yourself.
There is a Johnny Carmack

333
00:19:56.920 --> 00:20:00.530
in his early days, when
he was writing plans, he

334
00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:04.400
was often quoting the right
thing to do, which come

335
00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:09.380
from a book hackers and
releasing the source code to

336
00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:11.960
hold the people loved. It
was really the right thing

337
00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:14.390
to do. Yeah. Somewhere in
the middle of the book,

338
00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:16.550
when we start talking about
to 3d renderer, you make

339
00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:19.370
the, you make the kind
of comment that they had

340
00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:21.590
a contract to while they
were in the middle of

341
00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:24.350
making doom. They're going to
go in port Wolfen Stein

342
00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:28.580
to, to super Nintendo, which
is a very, very small

343
00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:31.850
under powered machine. And they
kind of forgot about it.

344
00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:34.130
And then they went, Oh,
crap. The deadline is soon.

345
00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.380
We need to do that.
So they stop working on

346
00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:39.890
doom. They run over, start
working on this ness and

347
00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:43.310
realize that their original algorithms
are not going to cut

348
00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:45.830
it. And you had made
the comment about how now

349
00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:47.830
we just, you know, we
go on Google or overflow

350
00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:50.980
back then you have to
order research papers and have

351
00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:53.650
them delivered and get copies
of papers to, to figure

352
00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:56.940
out if there's a solution
to your technical problem. Yeah.

353
00:20:57.030 --> 00:20:59.100
And in DISA current, actually,
it's not even in a

354
00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:01.170
book. I think he found
a solution. It was on

355
00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:07.530
a VHS, a recording of
some graphic computer graphics convention,

356
00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:10.380
or something like that. Oh,
wow. So he was watching

357
00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:15.030
Bruce, Bruce, Naylor's talk at
a conference and then ordered

358
00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:19.560
his bell labs paper and
learned about BSPs. Maybe you

359
00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:21.270
could speak a little bit
about what a BSP is

360
00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:25.620
and why it's so significant.
So BSP spends for Benares

361
00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:30.150
space petition, and it's a
very efficient way to sort

362
00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:33.960
the ward. So once you,
you, you, you pre-process the

363
00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:37.650
ward and you're going to
repeatedly slice it in half

364
00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:43.230
until everything is convex. Meaning
that from any point you

365
00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:48.570
can see every other point
in, in this area. And

366
00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:52.720
once you have that, it's,
it's very easy to render

367
00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:57.120
back to front or front
to back. And that's, that

368
00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:01.230
was the key of the
entire engine. So everything is

369
00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:05.280
convict. So nothing is, open-ended
nothing, everything folds in on

370
00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:08.910
itself as opposed to opens
out. And then you Trop

371
00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:12.090
everything up in the level.
You actually have wonderful graphics

372
00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:15.000
where you show the progression
from the level editor until

373
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.720
the convex Leafs to show
the creation of the first

374
00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:21.630
episode and the first map
and why that's so important.

375
00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:24.330
I was actually able to
explain it to my nontechnical

376
00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:27.540
spouse, who is not a
programmer, and they had no

377
00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:32.580
trouble understanding why that was
an important optimization. Well, that's,

378
00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:34.950
that's the goal of, of
the book. When I first

379
00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:37.890
got into computer graphics, I
had a very hard time

380
00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:42.840
to, to understand BSPs and
Oak trees and all those

381
00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:50.820
complicated barbaric technique. So yeah,
I think to some extent

382
00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:52.740
I wrote the book, I
wish I could have just

383
00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:56.910
been chased. It's interesting that
this is so important. It

384
00:22:56.910 --> 00:22:58.740
really comes down to that
constraint that we talked about

385
00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:02.340
at the beginning, it takes
11 minutes to go and

386
00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:04.740
process all of this ahead
of time for the 30

387
00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:08.130
maps of doom. So they're
basically, you know, they're pre

388
00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:11.550
chewing their food so that
the end user's computer doesn't

389
00:23:11.550 --> 00:23:14.760
have to do all of
that chewing itself. Yeah. So

390
00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:18.630
this pre processing was quite
a, I knowing for designers

391
00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:23.640
because we've often stains, they
would, they would just draw

392
00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:26.760
the map and instantly jump
into the game to see

393
00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:29.310
how it worked. And all
of the sudden they had

394
00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:32.430
a delay between the time
they finished the map and

395
00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:35.270
they could actually test it.
So, and that became even

396
00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:38.400
worse with quick, they keep
on adding more and more

397
00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:44.250
pre-processing, but that was the
only way seemingly to make

398
00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:48.140
it work. They also Were
very innovative in their, in

399
00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:50.990
their use of subpixels had
that been used before this

400
00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:54.520
time. I'm not sure it
had been used according to

401
00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:58.450
John Carmack. It was not
widely used if any, One

402
00:23:58.450 --> 00:23:59.950
of the things that John
Carmack says that I thought

403
00:23:59.950 --> 00:24:03.430
was so funny was that
because he was effectively disconnected,

404
00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:07.540
right? The internet was, was
FIDOnet and CompuServe and email

405
00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:10.810
between universities at the time,
you couldn't just go and

406
00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:15.010
Google something that he would
find himself all alone working

407
00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:18.700
in a, in a vacuum,
he would create something like,

408
00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:23.260
you know, LZ, LCW compression,
and then discover that, Oh,

409
00:24:23.290 --> 00:24:25.210
well, that was also created
by this person and this

410
00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:28.090
person and this person. Yeah.
And I think that illustrate

411
00:24:28.090 --> 00:24:34.840
how silly patents are. You
can rediscover something dependently, eh,

412
00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:39.880
we've actually stealing it for,
for, from somebody. Yeah. The,

413
00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:42.550
the, the first example, of
course, being the light bulb

414
00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:45.070
where it's the person that
got there first who gets

415
00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:46.960
all of the glory and
the other one is forgotten

416
00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:52.200
to history. Yeah. Sadly. Yeah.
I also appreciated that, that

417
00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:56.050
this book was very inclusive
and that it didn't force

418
00:24:56.050 --> 00:24:58.300
me to think about math.
I didn't really get into

419
00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:01.450
a equations and tell about
200 pages in. And even

420
00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:05.770
then they were, they were
somewhat straightforward to understand. I

421
00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:07.270
was worried there was going
to be a lot of

422
00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:11.920
math. Yeah. So that's because
my brain is allergic to

423
00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:16.120
mathematic. I wish it wasn't.
I tried to build up

424
00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:24.700
the strengths education in France
is very strongly focused on

425
00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:29.470
mathematic. And it was a
difficult time for me. And

426
00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:33.640
I try to explain things
with drawings because as soon

427
00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:36.790
as I see a mathematic
formula, I try to step

428
00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:39.720
back and I wish it
wasn't that way, but I

429
00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:42.340
believe there are many people
like me. So maybe, maybe

430
00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:44.320
that's why they like the
book One of them. And

431
00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:47.230
I appreciate that as well.
So do you think that

432
00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:49.570
this is an important book
for, for, for young people

433
00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:52.090
to read for people who
are, you know, who just

434
00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:54.250
pick up unreal and then
make a game, you know,

435
00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:56.550
and don't think about the
shoulders of the giants that

436
00:25:56.550 --> 00:25:59.980
they're standing on. I think,
I think people just want

437
00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:02.500
to make a game. It's
a bit of a fusing

438
00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:08.680
their time deepening their knowledge
of unreal. The archery reason

439
00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:12.000
why this book exists. The
main reason is that one,

440
00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:14.560
I wanted to preserve history.
I wanted people to be

441
00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:17.800
able to go to doom
source code and understand everything.

442
00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:21.460
We, the context, the second
is that I wanted to

443
00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:24.640
make sure I understood the
book doing code very well.

444
00:26:24.670 --> 00:26:27.160
And the best way to,
to make sure you understand

445
00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:29.020
something well is to try
to explain it to somebody.

446
00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:33.340
And the selfish reason was
that I wanted to write

447
00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:38.950
a book for people who
are in the game industry.

448
00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:41.350
As I mentioned earlier, where
they can get from this

449
00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:45.720
book is the spirit of
texts to achieve greatness. And

450
00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:48.270
it's not a secret. It's
just a lot of Ottawa

451
00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:52.760
and be hopeful and believing
in yourself. One of the,

452
00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:55.460
two of the fun things
that I liked particularly about

453
00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:58.130
the book was that as
I get towards the end,

454
00:26:58.130 --> 00:26:59.900
and I'm wondering where you're
going with this, and we

455
00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:02.420
get into the great graphics
and you talk about high

456
00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:05.510
and low detail mode, then
you spend a really, a

457
00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:09.110
nontrivial amount of time talking
about the ports. Once the

458
00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:13.520
PC version succeeds, they spend
basically three years porting it

459
00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:17.270
to six major systems from
the Jaguar to the super

460
00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:20.480
Nintendo. And like you point
out doom runs on watches.

461
00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:23.540
It runs anywhere like it's,
it's almost the first thing

462
00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:26.540
you port when you make
a new machine. Yeah. So

463
00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:29.030
originally I was not going
to talk about the console

464
00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:31.640
part. I just, and then
I started to look into

465
00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:35.000
it and every single port
has a very interesting story.

466
00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:40.160
The Jaguar is very, was
done by John Carmack and

467
00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:44.150
Dave Taylor. So it's interesting
to see how they work

468
00:27:44.150 --> 00:27:47.600
together, but then later on,
you can see the, the

469
00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:50.870
treaty of pot, which was
a complete failure to see

470
00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:53.930
all of the backstory that
went to, to it, or

471
00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:58.310
the PlayStation port, which nearly
was a disaster. And they

472
00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:00.440
managed to turn it around
and make it the best

473
00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:03.950
part ever. This, the history
of each pot was so

474
00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:07.160
rich and the hardware was
so interesting that I thought

475
00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:09.440
it had to be in
the book. Yeah. I mean,

476
00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:12.380
just as I've learned how
they go and render this

477
00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:16.760
2.5, you know, not quite
3d, but 2.5 D world,

478
00:28:16.970 --> 00:28:20.420
I'm trying to understand how
they, everything is thought about.

479
00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:23.750
And then suddenly we're talking
about triangles and doing things

480
00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:26.930
a totally different way. Cause
they rewrote the engine for

481
00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:30.980
different systems because that's how
the game, the hardware makers

482
00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:34.610
insisted that they do it
on different different systems. Yeah.

483
00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:38.630
To me, that the most
physically fascinating part is probably

484
00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:43.550
the Jaguar. It was it's
without being too tangy cold,

485
00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:49.040
you have two different CPS
and they have different architecture.

486
00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:52.770
That mean if you do,
you compile it for the

487
00:28:52.790 --> 00:28:57.980
Matera CPU, 68,000, and then
you want to use the

488
00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:01.670
other CPU. You need to
use another instruction sets. So

489
00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:04.400
essentially there is a compiler
part of the game for

490
00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:07.550
one CPU, part of the
game for another CPU. And

491
00:29:07.550 --> 00:29:11.150
they were loading instruction at
runtime and there was streaming,

492
00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:15.290
there was streaming it, they
broke down the rendition, the

493
00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:19.400
rendering engine in seven parts,
and then they were streaming

494
00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:22.490
it as a, as the
frame was being rendered to

495
00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:26.060
me, that's mind blowing what
they managed to achieve. Yeah.

496
00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:29.930
The Jaguar in 1993 was,
I mean, 64 bit in

497
00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:32.330
a commercial system was just
unheard of at this point.

498
00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:36.500
Yeah. To me it felt
like it was a bit

499
00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:43.720
of fake news that time
because 64 bit system where

500
00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:45.100
I had held off at
the time, and I think

501
00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:47.740
they played on the world
a little bit because the

502
00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:51.610
burst was 64, the GPU
was 64, but the rest

503
00:29:51.610 --> 00:29:56.140
of it was 16 and
sometimes eight. Yep. So maybe

504
00:29:56.140 --> 00:30:00.160
that's why he broke the,
the beach wall because people

505
00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:04.450
are, may finally realize the
city. It was, I really

506
00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:06.790
do encourage people to check
the book out and pick

507
00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:08.650
this up. It is one
of those books, like you

508
00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:11.620
say, in the, in, in
the book, in fact that

509
00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:13.150
you wanted it to be
a kind of book that

510
00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:16.360
would be immediate, that you
could hold in one hand

511
00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:18.100
and have some tea in
your other hand and just

512
00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:21.040
sit there and explore. I
love that you spent almost

513
00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:24.160
a hundred pages in just
appendix. I got to the

514
00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:25.450
end and I said, Oh,
I'm not even at the

515
00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:28.660
end. There's still there's dependencies
there's dot plans. There's the

516
00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:32.920
original press releases there's interviews.
I mean, even the appendices

517
00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:36.160
are almost a book in
themselves. Yeah. Again, it was

518
00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:39.730
to give people more context,
the press release. So Tom

519
00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:43.660
hall, what this press release
in January, 1993, when they had

520
00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:49.120
nothing is a promiser texture
mappings. They provides diminished lighting.

521
00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:52.210
They provide a bunch of
stuff that they hadn't done

522
00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:56.800
and amazingly they delivered. Most
of them interviews are also

523
00:30:56.800 --> 00:31:00.550
very interesting. And yeah, it
just gives a lot of

524
00:31:00.550 --> 00:31:04.690
context. I maybe I'm very
detail oriented and that's why

525
00:31:04.690 --> 00:31:09.370
I wrote 400 pages about
doom. But I, every time

526
00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:12.400
somebody explained something to me,
I always find myself, I

527
00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:15.890
screen question about why is
it done this way? And

528
00:31:15.910 --> 00:31:19.090
it's always a matter of
context. Well, I appreciate you

529
00:31:19.090 --> 00:31:21.280
coming on the show and
giving us even more context.

530
00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:24.910
Thank you for inviting me.
Fantastic. I'm going to include

531
00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:26.920
links to all of this
in the show notes. And

532
00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:29.470
I really encourage you that
check out the game engine

533
00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:32.230
black book, you can find
links to Amazon and Google

534
00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:35.590
books up on Fabiano website.
You can find it at

535
00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:38.380
Amazon or your local bookstore.
It is a joy. And

536
00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:40.420
I would really encourage you
to check out the physical

537
00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:42.820
version of the book. It
might cost more than the

538
00:31:43.030 --> 00:31:46.780
PDF, but it's just a
gorgeous, you know, every page

539
00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:49.480
has got some color or
some screenshot or some photograph.

540
00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:53.170
It's a wonderful piece of
history. Thanks so much. Thank

541
00:31:53.170 --> 00:31:56.410
you. This has been another
episode of Hanselminutes and we'll

542
00:31:56.410 --> 00:32:17.880
see you again next week.
