00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:02.270
Brewster author of pink.net. Hi,
this is Scott Hanselman and

10
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.610
this is another episode of
Hansel minutes, and I'm sitting

11
00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.930
here with Rick Brewster, author
of paint.net, the man, the

12
00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.690
legend paint.net, the only application
to have crushed paintbrush. How's

13
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.390
it going, Rick? Thanks for
chatting with me today. Yeah,

14
00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.320
thanks. I'm pretty good. So
how did this happen? How

15
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.350
did you decide how'd you
guys decide to make a

16
00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.460
paint application? Oh, well it
started my last semester of

17
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.240
college at Washington state university.
We were doing a senior

18
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.180
design project and one of
the projects we got was

19
00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.570
from Microsoft to say, Hey,
why don't we do a

20
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.630
paint program using GDI plots?
And so we had a

21
00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.520
mentor attached to it that
helps us kind of go

22
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.030
through the process of setting
up requirements and doing some

23
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.250
sign stuff and implementing it
and making sure we have

24
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.890
an actual professional quality product
with things like documentation. And

25
00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.680
then after that, I just
kind of ran with it

26
00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.840
on my own and did
some updates. And there was

27
00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.680
another set of kids back
at wazoo that I actually

28
00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.650
mentored to a version two
release of it, including Tom

29
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.550
Jackson. Who's also here at
Microsoft now, and then we

30
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.370
just kept running with it
since then and doing purpose,

31
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.090
especially based on what the
community kept asking me for

32
00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.800
you. I think like gradients
a special curve to all

33
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.420
to features that were community
feed or based on community

34
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.830
feedback. How much of the
process is plowing forward? Just

35
00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.280
kind of pushing yourself forward,
even though the code doesn't

36
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.150
feel right versus looking back
refactoring and saying, well, we

37
00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.840
really can't do, you know,
feature B until we change

38
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:48.000
the plugin model. Oh, that's
a pretty big question. There

39
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.510
are sometimes when there's a
small feature that we can

40
00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.970
implement, that gets us a
lot of sort of bang

41
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.910
for the buck. For example,
when I implemented the ability

42
00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.820
for the line tool to
also draw curves, that was

43
00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.770
a pretty simple one. The
gradient tool was also one

44
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.650
where we just added additive
using the existing architecture, but

45
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.280
then there is also sort
of this huge swap of

46
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.920
features that we can put
it off for a really

47
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.160
long time because the architecture
of paint.net doesn't support it

48
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.750
in a clean way or
at least in a way

49
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.340
where, you know, we'd have
to implement a lot of

50
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.090
stuff, you know, say in
three different ways. And then

51
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.040
if we wanted to redo
that architecture in a better

52
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.260
way, we'd have to re
implement those three things. Anyway.

53
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.410
So it's kind of a
hard question to ask because

54
00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.420
there's a lot of teachers
that actually have, you know,

55
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.480
I've been putting off until,
I guess the, you know,

56
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.890
now approaching the mythical status
version 4.0, which is going

57
00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.170
to have every feature under
the sun, of course, but

58
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.540
at least it's getting that
reputation. Whole thing is written

59
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.370
in C sharp, right? Is
there any C plus plus

60
00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.600
It's it is mostly C
sharp. There is senior C

61
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.380
plus plus for there's a
shell extension, which handles things

62
00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.770
like some nails and Explorer
for the native top. He

63
00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.670
didn't file type. There is,
there's a clipping library for

64
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.990
polygons called GPC, which is
also written in actually, I

65
00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.170
guess it's mostly C and
then there's a library called

66
00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.790
squish, which the DDS, which
stands for direct cross surface.

67
00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.540
I uses that for decoding
and encoding of the DDS

68
00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.840
file format, which is something
that they've used for games

69
00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.140
and the X and a
in the Xbox development stuff

70
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.860
a lot. Hmm. Now, you
know, now that seven's coming

71
00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.930
out, windows seven is coming
out. Do you feel pressure

72
00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.110
to revise it and make
your app look pretty on

73
00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.320
seven? Because I've installed it
on seven and it doesn't

74
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.500
quite have that gloss. I
do get people asking me

75
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.930
to put a ribbon in
there pretty much all the

76
00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.750
time, but if it's something
I have to approach carefully

77
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.680
in order to avoid, what's
called the cargo cult mentality

78
00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.810
where people where you think,
Oh, if I just add

79
00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.440
a ribbon, it'll be better.
Are you, are you familiar

80
00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.620
with their cargo Colt metaphor?
I am cargo cult programming.

81
00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.790
Right? So it's kind of
related back to that. I

82
00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:04.260
think it was, you know,
back in world war two

83
00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:08.820
or the natives on an
Island had an abandoned air

84
00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.560
strip, and they'd decided to
go out there and do

85
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.750
kind of the air traffic
controller, hand signs, but then

86
00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.720
the planes with food and
supplies do not come so

87
00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.290
Well. I think that the
ribbon is an interesting thing

88
00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.200
because it's more of a
people think of it as

89
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.750
being a feature that you
just slap in, but really

90
00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.570
it's, it's supposed to be
a usability improvement, but if

91
00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:33.180
you just take the existing
menus and toolbars and <inaudible>

92
00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.170
them, you aren't necessarily improving
usability, you're just adding a

93
00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:38.700
ribbon. So I'm sure that
this will be a lot

94
00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.390
of thought about the user's
workflow and how they, how

95
00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.430
they live inside of paint.net
that you're going to need

96
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.890
to think about. Otherwise you're
going to make a lot

97
00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:49.710
of people angry. Exactly. It
can't just be, you know,

98
00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.930
a reshuffling of the UI.
It has to actually be

99
00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.600
something that, because in office
they put in a whole

100
00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.970
lot of thought in terms
of, they put a whole

101
00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.050
of thought into the workflow
and the feature accessibility and

102
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:02.570
how they organized stuff. It
wasn't just, you know, we're

103
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:05.060
moving to menus and dropping
those into tabs on the,

104
00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.160
on the ribbon. It was,
it was a much more

105
00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.810
intricate process. Yeah. Now, one
of the things that I

106
00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:12.310
wanted to talk to you
about that I, that I

107
00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:16.210
like about paint.net as that
I think stands out is

108
00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:19.720
its set up process. I
think that it's got an

109
00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:24.130
extraordinarily clean setup. It doesn't
appear that you're using the

110
00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:26.620
standard kind of MSI set
up to the exe that

111
00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.440
pops out of, you know,
visual studio. And I've always

112
00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.900
kind of found that the
fact that two files pop

113
00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:33.910
out both in MSI and
any exe to be a

114
00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:37.390
little confusing, but paint.net has
always been, if you've got

115
00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:39.640
that down on your machine,
it's always pretty easy to,

116
00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:42.700
to install. How much work
are you putting into the

117
00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:47.680
setup application? There's actually been
quite a lot of work

118
00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.230
that's been put into there.
I can do a little

119
00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:52.060
bit of history on the
installer if you want me

120
00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:57.580
to start with that. Okay.
So originally paint on that,

121
00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:00.670
which is distributed as an
NSI, which was generated from

122
00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.820
visual studio set up was
her project. And you know,

123
00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:06.190
you kind of create it
in your studio. You point

124
00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:08.580
it towards your main executable
and it figures out the

125
00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:12.100
dependencies and create TNSI you
tell it the product name

126
00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.560
and the default installation directory.
And then you're kind of

127
00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.620
done. And this works great
for a lot of simple

128
00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:24.760
projects, but as paint on
that grew there, you know,

129
00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:28.420
I needed to do more
things with my installer. One

130
00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:32.260
of those was localization and
this is kind of difficult

131
00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.360
to do at least in
a way that's integrated with

132
00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:37.240
the whole rest of the
localization. But it's difficult to

133
00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:40.480
do with the building setup
was you, can't just, it

134
00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:43.150
doesn't have access to the
same strings pool, et cetera.

135
00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:47.590
So I wrote my own
setup wizard, which then P

136
00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:51.190
and volts into the windows
installer deal, MSI that deal

137
00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:54.070
to run the MSI, which
is still built with the

138
00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:57.910
setup with your project inside
of the studio. The other

139
00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:00.460
thing that had to be
dealt with was doing updates.

140
00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:04.270
And this was something that
I don't know if you've

141
00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:08.560
worked with building a or
building MSPs, but I went

142
00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.690
through a lot of the
documentation and was unable to

143
00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:12.730
really figure out how to
do them or how to

144
00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:15.550
do them correctly or to
get some good examples online.

145
00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:18.700
So I decided that the
update process for paint on

146
00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:21.670
that was just going to
be a fun install. And

147
00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:25.300
then re-install, and the setup
wizard is written in C

148
00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:27.280
sharp. And so it also
gives me complete control over

149
00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.110
the user experience. For example,
if I want to do

150
00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:31.900
like a WPF version of
the installed, I could do

151
00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:34.510
that. And it would be
a pretty cool experience, but

152
00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:37.510
you know, might not be
necessary. And the other thing

153
00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:40.030
that you kind of get
with installers is that once

154
00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:43.240
it works, you kind of
don't want to touch it

155
00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:45.880
that much. So, you know,
the fact, you know, like

156
00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:47.560
I said, I'm still using
the built in setup, was

157
00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:50.260
a project in Google studio.
That's kind of an artifact

158
00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:53.200
of the fact that it,
it works. So I'm not

159
00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.620
going to touch it. And
it's not really something that

160
00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:58.530
affects the user experience. So
it's not really, it's not

161
00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:03.650
a priority to change that.
No, I just took, as

162
00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:07.850
we were talking just now
I just took a paint.net

163
00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:15.230
three, three, six, 3.36, and
I ran it and it

164
00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:18.260
prompted me for an update.
It said, Hey, there's a

165
00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.710
new version. And no, I,
I had something else like

166
00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:24.230
three, three, five, it said
three, three, six. I hit

167
00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:27.020
install paint on that, shut
down. And they, the installer,

168
00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:30.680
when it re it, it
removed and, and then reenter

169
00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:34.250
it, removed the old version
and installed the new version.

170
00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:37.550
And now it wants to,
to restart my computer. Why

171
00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:42.110
is that? I'm not sure.
There's probably, Yeah. That's part

172
00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:45.230
of the builtin MSI experience
because there's the cool paint.net

173
00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:48.050
set up thing on the
outside. There's that, that white

174
00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:50.570
dialogue says paint that is
being installed, that you then

175
00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:53.600
call out, like you said,
into the MSI at that

176
00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:54.770
point, you know, where they
have a lot of control,

177
00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:56.420
like it wants to reboot,
but I have no way

178
00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:59.960
of knowing why. Right. But
it's probably the standard. There

179
00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:02.000
was some system file it's
locked or maybe it was

180
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.160
installing the, probably the system
that was locked, that it

181
00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:09.920
was trying to update or
something. Hmm. What did you

182
00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.840
write the little outside party?
And like right now it

183
00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:14.240
says optimizing performance for your
system. This is when you

184
00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:18.080
call engine, right? That's the
other thing that needed to

185
00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:21.950
be in the installer that
was, you can do it

186
00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:23.870
as part of the MSI,
but the user experience isn't

187
00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:27.170
quite the same, but it's
not as integrated. You know,

188
00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:29.060
it just ends up being,
as you know, another block

189
00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:30.890
on the progress bar where
this point I can actually

190
00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:32.870
call it out and say,
Hey, I'm doing something that

191
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:36.080
might take a minute. And
here's what it is, where

192
00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:39.240
the user gets a little
more information about it. And

193
00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:41.720
what did, what did you
write the setup part, the

194
00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:45.590
wrapper part in that's C
plus plus That that setup

195
00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:47.990
was like UI, it's a
C sharp. It uses one

196
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:53.840
forms. Yeah. And that actually
kind of segues into the

197
00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:57.080
whole food shopper retainer that
I use that have to

198
00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:01.430
detect.net before you can install
paint.net and not actually significantly

199
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:05.150
impacts the set up experience
for contentment. All right. So

200
00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:07.220
this is where it's getting
interesting. People may have lost.

201
00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:08.630
We may have lost a
couple of people there cause

202
00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:10.760
I'm, I'm jumping around here,
but let's start at the

203
00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:14.600
beginning. You, you download, you
go to your site, you

204
00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:18.470
go to get paint.net and
you hit download and you

205
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:22.820
bring down this zip file.
It's a, it's like a

206
00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:24.470
Meg and a half. It
takes no time at all.

207
00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:27.530
And inside the zip file
is an executable. And when

208
00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:30.470
you run that executable, you
know, you get the little

209
00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:34.130
prompt and it's signed, there's
a digital signature there, right.

210
00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:37.610
Cause you've gone to the
work of getting assert from

211
00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:40.700
somebody and you've signed that,
that executable. So when you

212
00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:43.850
get the little complaint from
Vista, it's actually a nice

213
00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:46.370
complaint because it says, Oh
well, there's, this is really

214
00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:51.590
from dot PDN LLC. This
is from the corporation. Right?

215
00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:55.660
How did so will you,
you have signed what at

216
00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:58.290
that point? So the way
that works is I purchased

217
00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:01.620
a signing certificate from, I
think it was Komodo. And

218
00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:04.320
then you install it into
your local certificate story. You

219
00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.480
give it the right name.
And then I have some

220
00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:09.330
as part of my build
process where I actually set

221
00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:12.060
some environment variables that say,
you know, assign PDN is

222
00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:15.000
one or zero, because it
does add some time to

223
00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.700
the build process. And then
it either, you know, the

224
00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:20.010
time to file with the
correct name in there and

225
00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:23.730
the correct certificate, which is
stored in a certificate store.

226
00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:26.970
And it has to do
that for, you know, the

227
00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:29.590
outer wrapper, the inner setup
exe, and a couple of

228
00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:32.370
other things. Yeah. So I'm
looking at a little file

229
00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:34.290
on my hard drive right
now. It says paint.net three,

230
00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:37.080
three, six, and I right.
Click and say properties. There's

231
00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:40.190
a tab in the properties.
It says signature list. And

232
00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:42.960
it shows that you stamp
this in August so I

233
00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:46.980
can go see Komodo. I
can see dot PDN LLC.

234
00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:50.040
And then it's been signed.
If I double click on

235
00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:52.020
it, I get the little
prompt, which is a nice

236
00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:54.210
one because it says, this
is from you. So I

237
00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:57.810
know it's not some random
evil paint.net. And then there's

238
00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:00.740
this, It's not the big,
scary yellow version of the

239
00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:04.470
EAC dialogue either. Exactly. That's
a good point. The scary

240
00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:07.110
yellow version of the dialogue
is the, this is unsigned.

241
00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:10.500
Correct. So, so that's, that's
how, that's how people who

242
00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:13.380
have share work and avoid
that dialogue is to sign

243
00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:15.510
they're right there. They're out
of right. And the thing

244
00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:17.640
with the digital certificate, or,
you know, assigned file is

245
00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:21.870
it's not that it's not,
you know, like an antivirus

246
00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:24.330
thing. Now you can't promise
that something that's signed, isn't

247
00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.940
going to do something bad,
but you can at least

248
00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:30.390
attribute that executable to somebody.
You know, like if I

249
00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:33.660
sign it and a signature
is holding up, then you

250
00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:35.970
know that the file hasn't
been tampered with. So you

251
00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:39.030
know, that the only person
that could have put that

252
00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:41.040
code in there, it was
me, but it wasn't like,

253
00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:43.710
you know, some website with
some random junk in there,

254
00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:47.040
that's doing something bad to
your computer. Now that doesn't

255
00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:49.110
mean I'm not doing something
that I wouldn't do something

256
00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:53.490
bad, but You know, that's
really a, that's really interesting

257
00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:55.830
because that, that, that is
one of the things that

258
00:13:55.830 --> 00:14:00.960
is similar for SSL certificates.
When, when my wife visits,

259
00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:06.210
you know, our bank, she
thinks that HTTP S appearing

260
00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.700
in the address bar and
having a little lock there

261
00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:12.030
indicates that she really is
talking to that bank. And

262
00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:16.830
it really only indicates privacy.
It doesn't indicate that Saying

263
00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:19.970
this hasn't been tampered with.
Right. So when you know

264
00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:23.460
a virus, I really enterprising
virus writer could certainly buy

265
00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:26.310
a assert and then say,
yes, this is evil. I

266
00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:28.710
promise. But it's so evil
that I've signed it with

267
00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:32.730
assert, which allows you to
attribute, attributed to them. Unless

268
00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:37.050
of course they stole your
assert, I suppose. Right, Right.

269
00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:38.970
So yeah. The other thing
with the cert is that

270
00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:41.910
it gives something of a
paper trail so that, you

271
00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:43.830
know, if the file hasn't
been tampered with, then the

272
00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:45.780
only person that could have
created, it was the person

273
00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:48.120
who has that certificate for
has the private side of

274
00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:51.770
that certificate, which if it
hasn't been stolen is going

275
00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:56.000
to be me. So, you
know, you know, they can,

276
00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:58.760
I suppose, go to the
records of whoever issued the

277
00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:02.980
certificate and figure out who
created that file. Exactly. So

278
00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:05.770
I double click on this
and I get a little

279
00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:08.020
pop up. I hit continue,
and then there's a flash.

280
00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:11.140
It just takes a second,
just an instant. And then

281
00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:15.610
a, what, what appears to
be a PDN setup folder

282
00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:20.350
shows up in my app
data temp. So if I

283
00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:22.300
go to my start run
menu and I type in

284
00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:27.940
percent, 10% percent, you made
a PDN setup folder, unzipped

285
00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:29.860
a bunch of stuff in
there. And then this really

286
00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:33.100
nice dialogue pops up. It's
really pretty diluted. What is

287
00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:35.740
the outer shell written in?
And, and what was that

288
00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:39.520
flash that I saw? Alright,
so, so Mike, you said,

289
00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:41.260
you know, something, a bunch
of files in that PDF

290
00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:45.220
setup folder. So the outer
shell of that is, you

291
00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:49.150
know, your typical self extracting
executable type thing. And I'm

292
00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:53.590
actually using something called MuleSoft
installer to create that, and

293
00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:57.550
you can, it's called NSI
or NSIF I think, and

294
00:15:57.550 --> 00:15:59.980
you can use that to
create an entire setup experience,

295
00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:03.730
but I'm actually only using
it for myself extraction process.

296
00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:06.340
And for checking a couple
of other things, like I

297
00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:09.370
checked to see if you're
running on windows 95%, you

298
00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:12.550
can't actually compile an exe
registered in 2008. That does

299
00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:16.210
that. So, Yeah, that's actually
called NSIs, right? It's the,

300
00:16:16.210 --> 00:16:20.470
it's called the pimp. Do
you know that it's called

301
00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:25.990
what N S I S
no soft, super pimp installation

302
00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:30.790
system. I thought the ice
did for installation. Nope, Nope,

303
00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:33.730
no soft. Or the guys
that made when amp, and

304
00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:35.320
this is the set up
program that they made for

305
00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:39.730
Winamp and an S I
S, which is the installation

306
00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:42.970
system is called a null
soft. That's the N super

307
00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:48.640
pimp installation system. They changed
it to no soft scriptable

308
00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:51.460
installation system, if, cause people
are offended by pimp, but

309
00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:57.610
pimp stands for plugin mini
packager, right? So it's an

310
00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:00.610
acronym within an acronym and
it's a really, really tight,

311
00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:05.440
clean, very, very small installer.
So you wrote a little

312
00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:09.040
tiny installer whose only job
it is, is to look

313
00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:11.710
in the temp folder and
then unzip itself and then

314
00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:15.670
run another installer pretty much.
That's pretty clever. So then

315
00:17:15.850 --> 00:17:20.530
I'm looking@thisdialogthatsayspaint.net, and it says
quick installation or custom installation.

316
00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:24.970
This is a WinForms application
I'm looking at, Right. It's

317
00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:27.370
a wind farm that, and
there's actually a little history

318
00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:30.010
behind the quick and the
custom buttons there. It used

319
00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:32.350
to be that paint on
that went through, you know,

320
00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:35.140
using the default installer UI
that was creating visual studio.

321
00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:37.900
It had, you know, Hey,
you know, here's your license

322
00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:39.580
agreement here? You know, where
do you want to install

323
00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:42.790
it? What options do you
want, et cetera. But most

324
00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:44.980
people installing a software and
I can get into a

325
00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:47.200
whole discussion about what I,
what I'm referring to. When

326
00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:49.920
I say most people, they
don't care about most of

327
00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:52.230
that stuff. So the quick
option gives them, you know,

328
00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:56.550
basically a two or three
click installation without access, or

329
00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:59.040
without needing to look over
all those sort of nerdy

330
00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:04.680
options. And that actually really
just cleans up the UI

331
00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:07.280
quite a bit. Yeah. There's
just that one option it's

332
00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:09.290
next and finished at that
point. It's pretty much at

333
00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:10.580
that point. All you have
to do is accept you

334
00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:12.380
and then bam, it just
goes, installed it with all

335
00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:14.360
the default options. Cause most
people don't really care about

336
00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:16.730
where it gets installed or
they just want it to

337
00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:19.580
use sane and default options.
So that's what I gave

338
00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:22.430
them. Now you're a, you're
a, you know, a micro

339
00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:25.970
ISV, independent software vendor, and
you're a small one cause

340
00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:29.000
it's you, why have a
ULA at all? Is that

341
00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.430
just did your lawyer say
to do that? Or what's,

342
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:33.680
what's the whole point of
a eulogy. It's a general

343
00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:35.690
legal thing. You know, if
you release some software without,

344
00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:39.470
without a ULA, then there's
sort of the, I'm not

345
00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:41.420
a lawyer of course, but
you want to make sure

346
00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:44.150
that people realize, Hey, you
know, this software carries no

347
00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:49.760
warranties. You can't come after
me for damages, but you

348
00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:51.890
know, in return, I'm also
not charging any money for

349
00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:54.500
it. So The eight, the
eight of you guys that

350
00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:57.800
wrote this originally, like all
the different folks, yourself, Chris,

351
00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:01.730
Tom, Mike, all these guys
that were involved, just hired

352
00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:03.920
a lawyer and made it
a little LLC. And who

353
00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:08.780
wrote this license? Oh no,
the license is actually, it's

354
00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:12.890
the MIT license. And it's
basically, Hey, here's some software

355
00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:15.110
and you can do whatever
you want with it, but

356
00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:19.070
we can't remove our copyright.
And so the other guys

357
00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:21.980
actually were involved before the
LLC was formed. The LLC

358
00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:24.710
is actually just mine. It's
a sole proprietorship. Oh, I

359
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:30.200
see. So I'm looking at
the quick and custom options

360
00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:35.330
and this application is the
setup front end dot exe.

361
00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:38.060
So I double clicked on
the outer wrapper. That was

362
00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:40.670
the little Knoll soft stuff.
It unzipped into a folder.

363
00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:43.430
I've got set up front
end on exe. And then

364
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:45.470
I've got to set up
front and set up front

365
00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:49.160
end exe config file. This
is that little config file

366
00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:54.560
that tells.net what runtime version
is preferred. This one says

367
00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:57.620
that it uses 2.0 as
the minimum, but it also

368
00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:00.230
has a little additional bit
of information that some people

369
00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:04.850
may not have seen before,
which is skew equals client.

370
00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:08.630
So you're saying that your
little installer will work with

371
00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:12.380
the dotnet three, five client
skew or what we call

372
00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:16.640
the client profile. Is that
correct? That's correct. That's something

373
00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:19.580
that you have to add
in otherwise, if you have

374
00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:21.890
the client profile installed and
you run a program that

375
00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:24.800
does not say skew equals
client, it will pop up

376
00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:29.120
a dialogue that says this
program requires done that <inaudible>

377
00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:32.510
don't get it. And so
if you try to install,

378
00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:37.070
paint on that 3.35, it
will. Or if you're trying

379
00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:38.690
to sell on a system
that has the client profile

380
00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:41.240
installed and not be full.net,
it will give you that

381
00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:45.080
weird dialogue. So it's 3.36,
Oh, it was a.zero one

382
00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:46.760
update. This was one of
the things that went in

383
00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:50.170
there, ensure that paint on
that. What installed justifying if

384
00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:54.210
you had just a client
profile installed. Okay. Cause the

385
00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:58.200
client profile is the subset
of the Dutton framework. And

386
00:20:58.230 --> 00:21:01.950
rather than assuming that applications
will work with the, with

387
00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:06.900
the subset they've added this
skew equals client attribute in

388
00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:10.350
order to basically declare that
I know that I'll work

389
00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:14.850
with this, this, this subject.
So you opt in and

390
00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:18.600
you, you work great, just
fine with the smaller net.net

391
00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:19.980
framework. Did you have to
put a lot of thought

392
00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:23.760
into that? And I didn't
have to put much thought

393
00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:26.250
into it in terms of
the development, but it actually

394
00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:29.370
did affect my installation process
a bit because I never

395
00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:32.190
had to include these dot
config files before. So now

396
00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:34.170
I had to go through
and make sure it was

397
00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:38.160
included both in the MSI
and in the self extractor.

398
00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:41.280
And in the way I
did my update because I

399
00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:44.340
actually copy a little exe
called update monitor into the

400
00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:46.920
test folder while I'm running
and installer. Now, when I'm

401
00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:49.410
doing an update and it
also needed to make sure

402
00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:50.940
that I also had to
make sure that the dot

403
00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:55.050
config file was copied along
with that too. Now in

404
00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:58.680
this temporary folder, there's also
a setup, shim dot exe.

405
00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:01.950
What is that for? That
is actually the thing that

406
00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:04.800
is executing set up front
end at EMC. So when

407
00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:09.630
the MFIs rapper extracts itself,
it then runs set up.

408
00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:12.210
Shinda exe set up. Shin
has written, or it's a

409
00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:15.300
small exe and it's written
in C and it checks

410
00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:18.210
for things like windows installer,
the correct version of that

411
00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:20.280
done at frameworks. And just
to make sure that, you

412
00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:22.800
know, all the other files
are there. Oh, and it

413
00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:25.770
also checks to make sure
that the trusted installer service

414
00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:29.070
is enabled when you're on
Vista, otherwise things don't work.

415
00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:32.040
And I have a blog
entry about that as well.

416
00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:34.260
Well, when I look at
this in process Explorer, cause

417
00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:37.950
sometimes task manager doesn't give
you enough information. I'm looking

418
00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:41.490
at the process tree. Okay.
So let's just take the,

419
00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:44.130
the listener back to where
we were at the beginning.

420
00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:47.790
I downloaded a single executable.
I double clicked on it.

421
00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:50.430
And the experience was that
I got a nice dialogue

422
00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:53.550
that says quicker custom. But
if I look at this

423
00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:57.900
in process Explorer, I see
that paint net three, three,

424
00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:04.080
six study exi called something
called mirror shim, mirror shim

425
00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:08.610
called paint.net set up that
he exceeded, which called setup

426
00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:11.880
shim dot exe, which called
set up front end. So

427
00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:15.510
I've got five different processes
that have all our all

428
00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:19.260
sitting there waiting for set
up front end to finish

429
00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:21.660
its work. That seems like
a lot of stuff going

430
00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:26.070
on, Right. It actually does.
See, it seems convoluted until

431
00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:29.880
I explain what each one
of those does. So the

432
00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:32.370
set of Shem is, you
know, I was just talking

433
00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:35.910
about that. That's the main
set up workflow, but then

434
00:23:35.910 --> 00:23:38.730
backing up to the paint
on that setup. That AC

435
00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:44.130
that is actually another self
extractor and then mirror shim

436
00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:47.570
is another little program NC.
And the reason for that

437
00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:51.380
being around is because when
you install at the very

438
00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:53.780
end, you get that little,
you know, it says optimizing

439
00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:56.690
performance. And then it says
that little banner that says,

440
00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:59.480
Hey, thanks for using pink.net.
Please donate. We can click

441
00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:00.890
on that and go to
the website, but then there's

442
00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:03.380
also room for a second
banner. And right now I'm

443
00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:06.980
using that banner to say,
pagers new features in paint

444
00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:08.990
on that version. You know,
whatever the newest one is,

445
00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:13.370
but that banner is actually
a PNG that's placed by

446
00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:16.700
mirror ship. And the reason
why I have sort of

447
00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:18.980
a second or a separate
wrapper to put that in

448
00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:21.470
is because I want to
be able to build paint.net,

449
00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:24.050
sign, paint.net. And I want
to be able to change

450
00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:26.780
that banner at a later
time, without having to spin

451
00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:29.990
up a new built, which
has risk associated with it

452
00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:32.240
in terms of, you know,
what, if somebody builds differently

453
00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:35.350
or I want to change
the version number just because

454
00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:38.200
you want to know The
version number and the timestamp

455
00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:41.170
and everything to stay the
same, where by allowing me

456
00:24:41.170 --> 00:24:44.470
to change that banner for,
you know, maybe I have

457
00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:46.960
a different link that you
click on. Maybe somebody wants

458
00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:50.080
to customize version for, Hey,
I'm an out, I've done

459
00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:52.930
this before. I had different
versions of the installers for

460
00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:57.220
beta news and major deeps.com
and some other mirrors where

461
00:24:57.220 --> 00:24:59.500
they all got their different
banner, but I only had

462
00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:02.200
to do the main bill
once, but, and then I

463
00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:06.640
just, I redid the outer
wrapper. Okay. So mirror Shem

464
00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:10.900
is just, it just extracts
that PNG. Cause what I'm

465
00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:13.720
trying to understand is that
I'm looking at five executable

466
00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:16.750
and I'm thinking to myself
as, as a, I guess,

467
00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:19.600
as the host here, gosh,
Rick had to put a

468
00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:24.280
lot of work into this
to possibly, you know, fix

469
00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:28.870
some, some deficiencies on the
part of Microsoft, of these

470
00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:33.220
five executable, which of them
are Rick being really focused.

471
00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:35.980
You know, you personally being
really focused on attention to

472
00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:40.120
detail, quality and agility versus
a deficiency in visual studio.

473
00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:42.640
So I think if mirror
Shem is only job is

474
00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:45.280
to put up a banner,
I'll say that that's not

475
00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:49.320
a deficiency in visual studio,
but we've got the, the

476
00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:54.790
outer wrapper, the unzipper the
check for, for.net check for

477
00:25:54.790 --> 00:25:57.220
the different runtimes. It needs,
you know, how many of

478
00:25:57.220 --> 00:26:01.390
these five executable files are
required because we didn't give

479
00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:03.700
you, we Microsoft didn't give
you what you needed to

480
00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:07.750
make an awesome application. It's
hard to say. I mean,

481
00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:10.570
a lot of it just
stems from the complexity of

482
00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:15.580
the windows environment in general,
just, you know, set up

483
00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:17.440
shim has to, or set
up some, like I said,

484
00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:19.150
it's the bootstrap or the
chain, or which has to

485
00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:21.280
then call set up front
end, which is the actual

486
00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:23.890
UI that you get. But
before it calls set up

487
00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:25.990
front end, it has to
make sure that certain dependencies

488
00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:30.010
are there like.net and when
there's installer. And so that's

489
00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:32.890
probably the one that I
would focus on in answering

490
00:26:32.890 --> 00:26:35.950
your question that, because windows
doesn't have a built in

491
00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:38.920
way of me or it
doesn't have a built in

492
00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:41.470
way for me to be
able to tag something. I

493
00:26:41.470 --> 00:26:44.700
using like say some metadata
to say this requires.net. So

494
00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:46.560
before you'd run this, make
sure that the user has

495
00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:51.150
that package. So you're saying
that you don't like the,

496
00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:54.470
the, the standard stuff, like,
cause the, the, the, the

497
00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:56.660
set up program that pops
out a visual studio will

498
00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:58.910
check for.net and make sure
it downloads it and stuff.

499
00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:02.360
It does check for.net, but
all you get an error

500
00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:06.080
message. Oh, I see what
you're saying. And he says,

501
00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:09.020
Hey, you need that net.
And here's the URL for

502
00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:12.620
it. Come back when you've
got it installed. And the

503
00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:18.470
problem there is that most
users will give up because

504
00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:22.070
it's too difficult to go
get.net, although it has improved

505
00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:25.400
recently because they put, they
put those, you know, get

506
00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:27.740
it now, download links on
the front page instead of

507
00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:30.860
having to do a search
for it and Wade to

508
00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:33.140
the download page and try
to find the download Well,

509
00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:34.850
and with, well, actually I
was one of the ways

510
00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:36.110
I was one of the
guys that worked on that

511
00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:39.680
to make that easier. If
so, if you, but if

512
00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:43.760
you build a client profile,
a installer, you just hit

513
00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:45.980
set up and it'll automatically
go and get the tiny

514
00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:49.730
setup and download it and
keep going. Right. So a

515
00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:54.500
lot of that is improved
with <inaudible>. Okay, cool. Cause

516
00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:56.510
I want to, and then
you just took a job

517
00:27:56.510 --> 00:28:00.530
at Microsoft. Is that right?
Right. I actually, I was,

518
00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:02.870
I worked there for about
four years and then I

519
00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:06.230
kinda took the summer off
and now I'm back. Okay.

520
00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:08.780
And what, what group do
you work in? I'm working

521
00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:12.350
in a windows fundamentals. Oh,
cool. And are you, you're

522
00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:14.600
going to take all this
feedback about making a really

523
00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:16.820
awesome set of program back
to the team to make

524
00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:20.960
sure that it's awesome for
the next version to the

525
00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:24.470
deployment folks, to like to,
well, to everybody I've actually

526
00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:26.990
met with him a few
times and talked with some

527
00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:29.750
of those guys and they're,
they're actually incorporating a lot

528
00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:33.050
of this feedback because there's
sort of a long tail

529
00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:37.910
of freeware applications out there,
which deployment of.net know they

530
00:28:37.910 --> 00:28:40.190
need dominant to run, but
you know, there's like a

531
00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:44.060
little 50 kilobyte share app.
Can I include that net

532
00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:46.970
because that would balloon it
to 50 megabytes. And it

533
00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:49.940
also is a lot difficult
for that author to make

534
00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:52.760
sure that the user has
done it installed. Yeah, well,

535
00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:55.820
like with my little application,
baby smash, I'm using click

536
00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:58.790
once and I'm starting to
think about things like, well

537
00:28:58.790 --> 00:29:00.680
now I've got a couple
of, you know, some, some

538
00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:03.890
number of thousands of people
using baby smash. How do

539
00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:07.220
I upgrade them effectively? What
happens if my certs expire,

540
00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:09.680
I haven't gone and done
any of the signing ahead

541
00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:12.050
of time. You know, I'm
starting to wonder if I'm

542
00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:14.420
going to paint myself Wiser.
If you want to translate

543
00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:16.040
your program in the other
languages, how do you make

544
00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:19.250
sure that your installers localized?
Yeah, exactly. And it wouldn't

545
00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:21.950
wouldn't, you're like, I would
think if I, if I

546
00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:25.460
had the pressure of having
something as popular as paint.net,

547
00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:28.160
you know, kind of hanging
over me, I would think

548
00:29:28.610 --> 00:29:31.430
what's the nightmare scenario. I
assume that your nightmare scenario

549
00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:35.330
would be a lousy upgrade
that would cause every, or

550
00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:37.910
some large number of paint.net
users to have to re

551
00:29:37.910 --> 00:29:42.730
install. Right. I guess the
nightmare scenario be. So right

552
00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:44.770
now the current version that's
on the website only real

553
00:29:44.770 --> 00:29:47.950
car has gotten a 2.0.
And so we're kind of

554
00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:52.120
at a, a known complexity
in terms of installing that.

555
00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:56.470
Now, if I want to
upgrade everybody to <inaudible>, you

556
00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:58.270
know, for example, the next
version of paint on it

557
00:29:58.270 --> 00:30:02.200
requires it, which will, all
of my users are going

558
00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:04.690
to have to install the
new version of.net. And so

559
00:30:04.690 --> 00:30:09.160
I have all of the
installation. So whenever you saw

560
00:30:09.170 --> 00:30:13.360
something, there's a statistical failure
rate. So if 1% of

561
00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:16.060
my users can't install the
new version of.net for whatever

562
00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:19.240
reason, then that, you know,
I ended up, I ended

563
00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:21.040
up with a flooded email
box, or just a lot

564
00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:23.620
of people who are now
no longer users of paint.net.

565
00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:27.840
Yeah. Now, are you going
to use the client profile?

566
00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:30.690
Is that your goal? Yeah.
So the paint on that

567
00:30:30.690 --> 00:30:36.120
version 3.5, which I'm hoping
to get out within maybe

568
00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:40.200
like, let's say two months,
I've radically simplified the installation

569
00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:42.630
process so that it doesn't
say, Hey, you need to

570
00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:46.290
go get.net. It actually just
runs the bootstrapper for paint

571
00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:50.310
or for.net framework. The other
thing I did was there

572
00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:52.890
are some users who are
on what I call a

573
00:30:52.890 --> 00:30:56.220
fresh XP box and they
need to install windows installer.

574
00:30:57.030 --> 00:30:59.460
And it's not so much
that there's a lot of

575
00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:02.760
people in this situation, but
when they are in that

576
00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:06.450
situation, it's just a dreadful
experience because they go to

577
00:31:06.450 --> 00:31:08.460
download, paint on it and
it says, Hey, you need

578
00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:10.740
to go get.net. So, okay.
They go to website and

579
00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:12.720
they get done it, but
then they go to try

580
00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:15.000
to install that net. And
it says, Hey, you need

581
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.940
to go get windows installer.
And so they go, okay.

582
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:24.300
And then when it's installer
installed, and then suddenly they

583
00:31:24.390 --> 00:31:25.920
go back and try to
install, paint on that and

584
00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:27.990
said, Hey, you need to
go get done that may.

585
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.810
And they just kind of,
it's a really frustrating experience.

586
00:31:30.810 --> 00:31:33.750
So now I have these
installers built into the zip

587
00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:37.230
file and it just runs
them. Yeah. That is much

588
00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:39.540
cleaner. You know, I think
that I don't see those

589
00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:44.100
issues for two reasons because
one, I have windows update,

590
00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:47.730
update everything for me, which
I think some people don't,

591
00:31:47.730 --> 00:31:49.590
I mean, I'm always going
to my uncle's house or

592
00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:52.830
my cousin's house and I
just I'll run windows update.

593
00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:55.530
And there's always some thing
that they never clicked on.

594
00:31:55.530 --> 00:31:58.560
Right. There's always that, that
check that says, you know,

595
00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:01.440
make sure you have windows
genuine advantage or some thing

596
00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:03.840
that they haven't clicked on.
And then I'll discover that

597
00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:07.440
they haven't had windows update
running successfully since April. So

598
00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:10.290
they don't have the latest
service pack.net, or they don't

599
00:32:10.290 --> 00:32:13.200
have the latest whatever. So,
I mean, there's, there are

600
00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:16.290
those people who keep their
machines updated. And then there

601
00:32:16.290 --> 00:32:18.990
are those that just get
stuck somewhere along the line.

602
00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:22.050
And then the other issue
is dial up versus broadband,

603
00:32:22.410 --> 00:32:26.720
right? Having ubiquitous broadband. I
don't think about, you know,

604
00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:28.860
a 60 Meg download. It
doesn't mean anything to me,

605
00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:31.590
but if you go to
New Zealand or somewhere with metered

606
00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:36.840
broadband or Africa, somewhere with
just dial up, then installing

607
00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:40.460
something simple, like a little
one Meg paint program becomes

608
00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:43.460
a day long event to
get your system up to

609
00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:47.110
date. Right. And so a
lot of people think, well,

610
00:32:47.110 --> 00:32:49.210
why do I need to
download 50 minutes for this

611
00:32:49.450 --> 00:32:51.940
one megabyte program? That's just,
you know, it's a paint

612
00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:55.990
program. And then they give
up and no, just use

613
00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:58.300
the built in stuff like
paint or, you know, they

614
00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:01.780
go for the larger programs,
which they think have a

615
00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:04.780
better value proposition for the
amount of time that they

616
00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:07.720
have to spend acquiring it.
Yeah. It'll be, it'll be

617
00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:10.510
nice to get the stuff
to get three, five everywhere,

618
00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:13.480
you know, too. Oh, they
do have that GDR release

619
00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:16.210
coming up, which should help
a lot actually. Right. I'm

620
00:33:16.210 --> 00:33:18.340
actually gonna be doing a
blog post about that. About

621
00:33:18.610 --> 00:33:21.790
when the GDR general distribution
release is that what's called

622
00:33:21.790 --> 00:33:25.540
GD general. What's GDR stand
for, I think it's general

623
00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:30.520
distribution release. So we say
general distribution release, release, GDR

624
00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:34.420
release. That's going to be
coming out in a downloadable

625
00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:36.280
form by the end of
the year. And then it

626
00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:38.230
will be up on windows
updates sometime at the beginning

627
00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:39.250
of the year. So I'm
going to do a whole

628
00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:42.130
blog post about that. So
w when, when, when that

629
00:33:42.130 --> 00:33:44.980
happens, we'll start seeing rolling
updates and then we'll be

630
00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:47.860
able to count on people
having, you know, who have

631
00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:50.650
Vista being updated to three
five. So that should make

632
00:33:50.650 --> 00:33:52.960
life a little bit easier
for, for you. As a,

633
00:33:53.010 --> 00:33:56.640
as an idea, There is
still the, for programs, which

634
00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:58.990
soft on XP, which is
quite a bit of them,

635
00:33:59.410 --> 00:34:01.510
you still have to do
the, you know, is windows

636
00:34:01.510 --> 00:34:05.050
installer. There is net there
because the update isn't going

637
00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:10.240
for systems that don't have
anything installed. Cool. Are you

638
00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:12.910
going to continue to do
blog posts on how to

639
00:34:12.910 --> 00:34:14.470
write software, right. And how
to do, how to get

640
00:34:14.470 --> 00:34:18.460
these installers? Correct. I don't
have any specific plans, but

641
00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:21.700
I mean, these things kind
of come up whenever I,

642
00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:23.950
you know, get in the
right mood for writing stuff.

643
00:34:25.630 --> 00:34:28.210
Well, I really, I really
enjoy paint.net and I enjoy

644
00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:31.600
your blog. Your blog is
at blog dot, get paint.net.

645
00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:34.810
You put a lot of
really information, cool information up

646
00:34:34.810 --> 00:34:37.450
there. It's all very transparent.
You talk about what your

647
00:34:37.450 --> 00:34:39.910
plans are and, you know,
you put up your usage

648
00:34:39.910 --> 00:34:42.340
statistics, you know, how many
people are hitting the site

649
00:34:42.370 --> 00:34:45.430
per day? What, what operating
systems they are. It's really

650
00:34:45.430 --> 00:34:51.150
cool to have such a
transparent sharing of information. Yeah.

651
00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:52.720
It's fun to write this
stuff. It's just a matter

652
00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:54.970
of, you know, when do
I have, you know, whenever

653
00:34:54.970 --> 00:34:57.010
I get the free time
to do it, I have

654
00:34:57.010 --> 00:35:00.790
to choose between working on
paint on it or say

655
00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:04.990
drinking beer, playing video games.
And so sometimes the ladder

656
00:35:04.990 --> 00:35:07.390
stuff wins out. I'm glad
that you have your priorities

657
00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:10.030
straight. Cool. Well, thanks Rick
Brewster for talking to me

658
00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:13.720

another episode of Hansel minutes,
