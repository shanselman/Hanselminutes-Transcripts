Hi, this is Scott Hanselman,

8
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.730
and this is another episode
of Hansel minutes and I'm

9
00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.580
here in beautiful and incredibly
hot Washington, D C inside

10
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.550
the convention center. And I'm
talking with the inimitable Barrett

11
00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.040
Tuneday Thirstin from, and we're
bragging Rob Brown right now.

12
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.050
It's VR. We're at the
blogging conference and you're the

13
00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.220
web editor at, at the
onion at America's finest news

14
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.150
source. Our trusted news comes
from the onion. Yes. And

15
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.630
you do stand up and
you write books and you're,

16
00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.340
you're a personality. I am,
I am me without me.

17
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.340
I'm here at this conference
cause I helped start a

18
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.550
blog called Jack and Jill
politics, black political blog. I've

19
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.040
hosted a TV show in
the science channel, all about

20
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.410
the future of science and
tech. I do stand up

21
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.780
regularly and I'm writing a
book called how to be

22
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.930
black, how to be flat
important guidebook. Okay. And is

23
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.570
this, this is for primarily
white people. This is for

24
00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.390
everybody black people and those
who love them. So that's

25
00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.630
excludes maybe Glenn Beck rush Limbaugh.
I'm not sure, but it's

26
00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.850
a big market. Okay. And
are there any initial tips

27
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.140
that our listenership worldwide listenership
could hear? You know, our

28
00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.210
friends in Cairo and our
friends at Dubai who want

29
00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.190
to be black, what they
can do, your global audience

30
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.770
one is to understand that
you're going to be called

31
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.320
on, to be a spokesperson
for the race at some

32
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.840
point, and how you prepare
for that. It's very important.

33
00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.540
So you've got to have
a track suit as well

34
00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.510
as a business suit that
you keep available at all

35
00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.350
times. Okay. Find cameras and
speak into the microphones around

36
00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.440
them. Even if you're not
invited, it's very, very important

37
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.650
that you always be speaking
and have video and audio

38
00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.230
evidence of that speaker would
be cell phone cameras or

39
00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.440
anything at this day and
age that we'll do a

40
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.100
big professional camera helps and
have some claim to Martin

41
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.290
Luther King, jr. Even if
you just like read a

42
00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.040
book or saw a rally
on CV, if you have

43
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.740
some dotted line between you
and that figure in the

44
00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.820
civil rights movement, it really
improves your odds of being

45
00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.550
taken seriously. You know, speaking
of walking around with a

46
00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.740
camera, when do you think
the first time that a

47
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.300
cop is going to hit
a black person and we're

48
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.520
going to have like seven
20 P high quality flipped

49
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.210
video of that HD Rodney
case? When is the HD

50
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.910
Rodney King and a half?
Because for my iPhone four,

51
00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.460
you think the iPhone four
is the beginning of our

52
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.880
first, you know, AGD police
brutality. As I tell you,

53
00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.210
the cop in Seattle hit
those girls and you know,

54
00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.350
nobody should hit anybody, but
I couldn't see anything. I

55
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.300
don't even know What was
going on in that picture.

56
00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.110
JPEG, you know, I'm very,
very blocky, very low. So

57
00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.900
we need higher resolution in
our, you know, civil servant

58
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.940
abuse. Yeah. I think I'd
probably want to just wear

59
00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.700
an HD live stream and
do the whole justin.tv thing.

60
00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.350
Go 3d. If you're going
to go that far, get

61
00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.200
a multi-camera shoot, have people
around you to get at

62
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.300
least two angles on the,
on the person Or maybe

63
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.060
like a matrix rail, you
know, when it actually happens,

64
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.640
I can move in three
days Time, you know, in

65
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.460
your, in your abuse situation,
this is important stuff. It's

66
00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:33.570
crucial. Yeah. Okay. So tracksuit
Always be talking to camera

67
00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.510
and then always represent a,
be there to represent the

68
00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.480
entire race as an individual.
When you speak, you're representing

69
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.850
The whole of Brown folks.
Yeah. There's like this sort

70
00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.640
of like always be closing
and Glen Gary, Glen Ross

71
00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.460
has always be representing in
terms of being black. Like

72
00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.650
even when you think you're
not on camera and not

73
00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.280
on a mic, you are,
and you're speaking for everybody

74
00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.240
Now. What about the, what
about these white people who

75
00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.890
say that they have a
black card, like John Mayer declared

76
00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.190
that he had a ghetto
pass. Yeah. And then other

77
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.890
ignorant things after that to
justify it Because he's not

78
00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.440
the only white person to
have done. We're certainly entering

79
00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.040
a very fluid cultural time,
especially with more media out

80
00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.140
there. I mean, on behalf
representing the entire white race,

81
00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.770
I'm thinking for all white.
Yeah. Yes. And you're just

82
00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:19.980
being happy. We have a
tendency to do that. You

83
00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.200
know, like the, you know,
well, let me tell you

84
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.850
about my black friend. Right?
I have this, I have

85
00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.180
this black friend. There's a
chapter called how to be

86
00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.580
the black friend, but I'm
actually really writing right now.

87
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.490
I'll be sure to include,
you know, some of this

88
00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.820
perspective. Thank you. Do why
do black people need white

89
00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.690
friends? Yeah. I guess if
you want access to certain

90
00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:45.090
areas of society like cabs,
it helps, you know, mortgages

91
00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.600
at a reasonable rate. Yeah.
I think we all need

92
00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.300
actually honestly need friends of
different races. It helps all

93
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.590
that wonderful stuff. But yeah.
Now I noticed in a

94
00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.230
meeting that you and I
were at an unknown location

95
00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.820
that a, a very nice
white gentleman in power, I

96
00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:07.530
felt turned on his black
scent. And I wasn't sure.

97
00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.600
I was like, well, you
know, I looked on Wikipedia,

98
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.790
he's from Connecticut. I was
like, really? Okay. I guess

99
00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:13.890
that's how they talk in
Connecticut. And then he said,

100
00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.980
I'm just going to keep
it real for y'all. And

101
00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.410
I said, Oh, he just
turned on the black center.

102
00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.430
Now I don't know about
you, but race not withstanding.

103
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:28.860
I can't talk to an
Irishman. You know, I had

104
00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.840
an Irish neighbor and I'm
in, you know, he's like,

105
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.760
Hey Scott, how's it going?
I'm like, Oh, I'll make

106
00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.250
a spaceship and fly away
with my lucky charm. Like,

107
00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:36.810
Whoa, I didn't even know
where that came from. I

108
00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.270
mean, you know, I just
can't talk to an Irish

109
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:40.530
person without doing that. So
I don't think it's a

110
00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.870
race thing necessarily, but I
mean, do you find It

111
00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.650
is a cultural phenomenon that
is more unique to black

112
00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.440
people because so much of
black culture has become American

113
00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.170
culture. You look at jazz
music, rock and roll. Hip

114
00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:54.720
hop music is a very
powerful example. Food's a very

115
00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.470
powerful example. And language is
a very powerful example in

116
00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:01.790
part because of music. So
mainstream news anchors say, keep

117
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:05.330
it real, use the word
dis give shout outs on

118
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.750
the today show. And it's
really awkward, but they're not

119
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.900
claiming blackness. They're just claiming
coolness because so much of

120
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.480
blackness has become cool in
the eyes of so many

121
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.230
in part because of music.
But when did being white

122
00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:19.870
become uncool, I mean, I
feel bad about all the

123
00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:24.280
bad white stuff that my
ancestors did to y'all, but

124
00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.670
Please say to you people,
I think it's better when

125
00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:31.510
you say, Do you, people
are your people Oh, much

126
00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:37.000
better. Yeah. You and yours,
your people. But, but honestly,

127
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.010
I don't think I can
accept the white guilt, but

128
00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:40.630
I don't think I can
accept the white uncool. Right.

129
00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:43.180
Wow. This is okay. So
you're going to have to

130
00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.250
write a book on how
to be white and then

131
00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:47.770
we'll do a companion edition.
Would you buy both? I

132
00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:50.620
think it would just be
appendix a of, of your

133
00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:52.180
book. Alright. I mean more
than happy to write the

134
00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:54.340
forward. That could be how
to be white. That's funny.

135
00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:57.340
That's funny. Do you think,
do you think that black

136
00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:00.100
people have a white scent?
Like the white, white accent?

137
00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.800
I definitely, I mean, depends
on what your educational background.

138
00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:05.740
I mean, there's certainly a
satirical comedic black scent that

139
00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.380
you hear some comics do.
It's more nasal and high

140
00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:10.750
pitched and more clipped. I'm
not really sure where that

141
00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:12.640
came from. I don't think
white people talk like that

142
00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:16.030
at all. Most white people
don't talk like that, but

143
00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.220
you know, if you've gone,
like I belong to a

144
00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:21.100
lot of private education later.
My life has certainly changed

145
00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:23.080
the way I talk. Just
the people I associate with.

146
00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.360
Yeah. On purpose. I mean,
you're not thinking about you

147
00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:26.620
don't wake up and say,
I think I've talked white

148
00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:30.580
today. Maybe I should. Can
I get a big Mac

149
00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:33.730
please? Yeah. It's more of
like a natural, like white

150
00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:39.280
voice on demand is going
to happen. So you're working

151
00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:42.670
in like a professional conference
room, business meeting, conference call

152
00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.680
type situation. It's going to
be different from sort of

153
00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:48.010
hanging out at the bar
with your friends truly. And

154
00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:49.990
that's true for everyone, For
everybody, no matter what color

155
00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:52.960
they are. Exactly. The same
Black people are. No, we

156
00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.780
stretch more because of the
different worlds and how different

157
00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:58.330
some of those worlds are
in general. Right. Oh, that's

158
00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:00.700
an interesting thing. Do you
think that black people either

159
00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:05.110
have, or are required to
have more elasticity of personality

160
00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.270
than white people? This is
where, you know, you hear

161
00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:10.900
this phrase white privilege. We're
talking about race now. Oh,

162
00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:12.430
I didn't mean to go
there and we only seven

163
00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:16.810
minutes into it. But part
of the Genesis of that

164
00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:20.770
is the idea that race
is an unconscious aspect of

165
00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:23.620
most white people's personality, where
blackness is a very conscious

166
00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:26.710
aspect of most black people's
lives and personnel. You're constantly

167
00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:30.070
reminded of your blackness through
certain areas of society. Right.

168
00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:33.490
And historically speaking, you had
one way of talking to

169
00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:35.950
those who really had absolute
power and could use it

170
00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:39.220
to crush you and your
people, and then another voice

171
00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:41.410
around those who were life.
Right? Exactly. So that has

172
00:08:41.410 --> 00:08:43.900
maintained today to a large
degree, with a lot of

173
00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:46.630
black people. Whereas white people
could always just more or

174
00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:49.930
less be themselves relative to
the space that black people

175
00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:51.700
are allowed to be themselves.
We all have a professional

176
00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:55.120
personal line. Right. It'll all
necessarily have like an in

177
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:57.790
race group out of race
group line. Right. Right. And,

178
00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:00.800
and, and that, there's always
this, the juxtaposition between black

179
00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.860
generational pain and white guilt.
And of course it is

180
00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:08.330
generally believed that white generational
pain has more legitimacy. Then

181
00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:12.320
the generational pain, like you're
born and already, you have

182
00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:15.020
the weight of 400 years
of slavery on you. You

183
00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:16.820
know? And it's like, you,
you could, you could be

184
00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:20.180
born, go to a private
school and go straight to

185
00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:23.210
Harvard and skip anything, nothing
back, no one follows, no

186
00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:24.800
one shoplift, you know, no
one follows you thinking you're

187
00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.570
going to shoplift. Right. You
aren't, you still get to

188
00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:29.360
claim generational pain. Got it.
Yeah. Know what I'm saying?

189
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:34.730
No, there there's, it's, it's
become part of for black

190
00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:37.850
Americans, you know, it's become
part of your cultural identity

191
00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:41.030
and that is passed on
him in some senses. It's

192
00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:44.030
because at any moment there's
still this fear and certain

193
00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:46.790
reality that these things can
be taken from you. Or

194
00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:50.300
you can be reminded that
yeah, you're very successful, but

195
00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:54.410
I could pull you over
for no particular reason and

196
00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:56.690
you'd have this doubt in
your head. Right. And that

197
00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:58.910
in itself, it legitimizes that
any power that you may

198
00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:01.790
have developed, and then whenever
someone famous, like skip Gates,

199
00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:05.690
Robert who skates got, you
know, had a little situation

200
00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:08.150
where someone thought he was
breaking into his own house,

201
00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.520
right. It's like, no matter
how, how high up you

202
00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:12.050
get in the halls of
power or the halls of

203
00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:15.280
academia, we can still treat
you like we didn't have

204
00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:17.640
it. I think one of
the more fun parts of,

205
00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:21.110
of race is that there
is a legitimate possibility of

206
00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:23.870
some of these things happening.
There's also this sort of

207
00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:28.190
corrosive power of self doubt
as a black person, when

208
00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:30.650
you're just like wondering, like,
did that person look at

209
00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:33.590
me funny? Cause I'm black
because I smell bad. Right?

210
00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:35.300
Like why did this thing
happen to me? And you

211
00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:38.630
have so much history pointing
to, you know, reason, X,

212
00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:41.240
but you're never sure. So
is this the doubting of

213
00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:44.480
yourself? It may not have
been a race related at

214
00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:47.870
all, but you're never quite
sure. And so that also

215
00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:51.260
leads us some fun abuse
situations on your part where

216
00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.870
you just blame race for
everything. That's obviously You say

217
00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:56.060
that because my wife and
I, my, my wife is

218
00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:58.430
black wife and I have
this kind of thing where,

219
00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:00.380
you know, if something goes
wrong, someone cuts us off

220
00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:04.790
and we get racism. The
man will not let me

221
00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:07.010
have that parking spot. You
know, why can't we do

222
00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:09.860
that? I have fun with
race and racism. It will

223
00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:12.320
eat you alive. Do you
think that white guilt, the

224
00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.630
notion of white guilt is
a legitimate thing? I mean,

225
00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:17.600
our, our, our young, this
was not young, necessarily young

226
00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.360
trustafarians right. You know, like,
you know, young kids with

227
00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:23.270
dreadlocks and a trust fund
that are out there, you

228
00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:25.490
just get white liberal privilege,
but this is just the

229
00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:27.920
general idea of like, Hey
man, it wasn't me. I

230
00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:31.940
didn't, you know, I wasn't
running the ice cream shop,

231
00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:34.520
but you guys had the
Senate. I think the phrase

232
00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.860
white guilt has been around
for quite some time. It's

233
00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:39.410
worn. And I don't know
if it's very useful is

234
00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:41.390
in as much as the
phrase post racial is also

235
00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:44.090
a pretty useless, that's going
to real old what I'd

236
00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:46.370
love to see. And I
think about this whenever I

237
00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:48.890
have these kind of questions
about trying to see from

238
00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:51.290
another perspective, it's like, okay,
I'm a dude, what is

239
00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:55.090
my relationship to women's rights
and feminism and the things

240
00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:56.590
that happen on the other
side of the line that

241
00:11:56.590 --> 00:12:00.400
I'm not on, on the,
so what is my responsibility

242
00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:04.980
to fight sexism? Or, Or
does it already any line,

243
00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:07.390
any line that I'm not
on that side. So, and,

244
00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:08.880
and that really came to
me when I was at

245
00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:12.150
a very longterm relationship and
my girlfriend, she was feeling

246
00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:16.320
quite uncomfortable about walking somewhere
at night. And I was

247
00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.540
like, what was why? She
said, well, I didn't feel

248
00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:24.210
safe. I never don't feel
safe. I'm physically fit. I

249
00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:26.370
have, you know, not too
imposing figure. I know how

250
00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:28.620
to walk in different types
of streets. I, I don't

251
00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:31.950
fear for my public safety
ever. And that is a

252
00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:35.610
privilege of my maleness that
I don't have to think

253
00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:37.140
about. And that it's a
privilege that I don't have

254
00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:39.180
to think about it. So
for me to be more

255
00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:42.540
sensitive, to, and cognizant of,
you know, concerns of women,

256
00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:44.250
I have to actively make
it a part of my

257
00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:46.590
life and think about it
and not just not be

258
00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:49.470
bad. So on the white
side of this and the

259
00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:51.420
whole white guilt thing, it's
not so much about feeling

260
00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:54.660
guilty about things. Some of
your ancestors may have done

261
00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:56.820
to some of my hands.
My people came from Scotland.

262
00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:02.610
I did not come over
with me, Varied history that

263
00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:05.730
gets going to blend it
in, in white. But you

264
00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:07.770
know, it's like, well, what
do, what are, what am

265
00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:09.270
I benefiting from? Or what
do I not have to

266
00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:11.760
think about? Yeah, it has,
I'm white than other people

267
00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:14.100
might. And how do I
then live a little bit

268
00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:17.730
more cautiously, knowing that That's
really interesting. My wife has

269
00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:19.470
made those similar comments. Cause
you know, I was like,

270
00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:21.450
yeah, I was in New York
and I walked from Midtown

271
00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:25.230
up to Washington Heights and
it was great walk Can't

272
00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:28.320
believe you did that. You
just have no. And you

273
00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:29.670
put it in such an
eloquent way. I just can't

274
00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:32.370
conceive of a world where
I couldn't walk anywhere. I've

275
00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:34.620
walked in, you know, all
these major cities in the

276
00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:36.420
world, they didn't give it
a thought. Right. And then

277
00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:38.550
on the way back, like
what's going back from Cairo.

278
00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:41.760
And I met a woman
in Europe who was going

279
00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:45.270
the other direction and I
felt, I found myself unconsciously

280
00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:47.550
kind of thing. You're traveling
alone. Is that a really

281
00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:51.060
good idea? Yeah. She shouldn't
go backpacking to Cairo by

282
00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:53.400
herself. And then I realized
that I was going to

283
00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:55.620
being sexist against her just
by applying that it was

284
00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:59.580
not. Yeah. Yeah. That's amazing.
You got to laugh about

285
00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:02.790
this stuff where you will
be eaten alive. Yeah. Speaking

286
00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:04.290
of last or what exactly
do you do at the

287
00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:07.890
end? So my title there
is web editor. My job

288
00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:09.000
there, I like to think
of it as sort of

289
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.630
a grid I'm responsible for
all of the sort of

290
00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:16.200
digital expressions of the onion.
I think of an X

291
00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:20.130
axis, which has our website,
our mobile site, our mobile

292
00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:23.490
apps on iPhone and Android
tablet apps coming down the

293
00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:26.880
line or tablet experiences. If
they're not apps, social media.

294
00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:30.600
And it's probably something else
I'm forgetting right now. And

295
00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:31.950
then on the Y axis
is think of all the

296
00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:35.040
editorial production we do. We
have the onion newspaper, we

297
00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:37.860
have onion, radio news and
your news network video. We're

298
00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:40.830
working with two television shows.
We've got live event series.

299
00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:43.320
We have books that we
publish, like our dumb century

300
00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:46.080
and our dumb world. There's
the big Atlas then fill

301
00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:51.240
in that matrix with things
with the audience, with sales,

302
00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:54.740
with, you know, the, the
work that we do. Satirically,

303
00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:56.810
it's my job to help
think about how are we

304
00:14:56.810 --> 00:15:00.050
represented on an E reader?
And what does that product

305
00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:02.000
look like? What is X,
what does the onion tweet?

306
00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:04.700
Who does the onion follow
on Twitter? The answer, no

307
00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:08.060
one, but that's a conscious
choice to say consistent with

308
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:11.540
all that we've done over
the past 20 to 300

309
00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:15.310
years, depending on how old
you think we are. Hi,

310
00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:18.220
this is Scott Hanselman from
another parallel universe. Gotta tell

311
00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:20.050
you about some of our
things our sponsors are doing.

312
00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:23.830
They make this free podcast
possible. If you're developing a

313
00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:26.440
new line of business application,
you've probably tried the latest

314
00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:28.810
version of server light. Now
you can get even better

315
00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:32.260
results by combining the functionality
and Silverlight for beta with

316
00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.240
some of the richness or
the third party controls from

317
00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:37.630
our friends at Tellerik. They're
the first vendors to offer

318

326
00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:04.840
thank Tellerik for supporting Don
and rock supporting Hansel minutes

327
00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:08.800
on their Facebook fan page
at facebook.com/tellerik. Now back to

328
00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:11.830
the show. So that's the,
that's the Voice of the

329
00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:15.070
digital onion. Yeah. Yeah. I
like that. I like that.

330
00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:16.930
The voice of the digital
life that you can have

331
00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:19.660
that, thank you. I got
that for free. Is there

332
00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:21.940
a voice of the onion?
Is there like a secret

333
00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:23.710
person that we don't know
about or is it, is

334
00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:26.170
it true Elective mind? That's
the beauty of it? You

335
00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:28.780
know, when it's the latter,
I joined the onion in

336
00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:31.330
November of Oh seven, just
shortly after moving to New York

337
00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:33.760
for the express purpose of
doing more creative things. I

338
00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:36.970
worked for eight years strategy
consulting around telecom and media

339
00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:39.040
and the future of the
web. Probably we're gonna mix

340
00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:42.550
and match and make media
for big companies. And I

341
00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:45.280
do my solo thing on
stage creatively. And it's all

342
00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:47.470
about me. I do stand
up, set up as a

343
00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:50.650
very egotistical field, right? And
that it does take a

344
00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:54.520
certain medicine perspective. My life,
you should be shutting up

345
00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:56.050
and listening and laughing to
what I have to say

346
00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:58.690
about me. The onion is
the very opposite sort of

347
00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:01.390
creative environment. There are no
by-lines at the union and

348
00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:04.330
the ones that are there
are false. It very much

349
00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:06.670
is kind of like the
world of improv comedy in

350
00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:09.100
that it's a group effort.
And so the collective is

351
00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:10.720
represented and that's what you
joined. And I sort of

352
00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:13.360
relish the opportunity actually to
be on a team. I

353
00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:16.600
love myself. I think I'm
pretty cool, but I like

354
00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:18.550
a lot also being a
part of something that's much

355
00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:21.160
bigger than any one person
could be. So the onion

356
00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:24.100
sort of quote, unquote newspaper
has a chief and editor.

357
00:17:24.610 --> 00:17:28.030
The onion video department has
the head writer and I

358
00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:32.050
had the director, but everything
you see as a result

359
00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:34.720
of, you know, dozens of
people being involved in that

360
00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:38.170
process and rejecting a lot
of bad ideas or just

361
00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:41.590
okay. Ideas to only leave
the truly best ones that

362
00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:43.450
are possible. And is it
remote or do you guys

363
00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:45.700
work in an office? We
worked together in an office.

364
00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:48.820
So our tech team is
scattered and we have a

365
00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:51.840
live IRC channel that everybody
kind of reports to as

366
00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:55.320
the office every day. Yeah.
But the writers are the

367
00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:57.510
full time writers are in
New York and meet on a

368
00:17:57.510 --> 00:18:00.390
regular basis. We have a
field of contributors who work

369
00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:03.870
remotely and send things in
shorter form that's for the

370
00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:06.750
headline generation and that kind
of short, you know, comedic

371
00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:08.850
generation, but for the long
pieces, that is an in

372
00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:10.640
the room, Mexican. So that's
an organic thing. It's a

373
00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:12.410
pitch. I mean, and you're
acting it out and there's

374
00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:15.710
probably pantomime and jumping up
and down or, I mean,

375
00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:18.470
there's different processes for video
and for the credibility, This

376
00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:22.460
paper content, newspaper concept, Beautiful
day here in Washington, D

377
00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:26.720
C Right. We're in the
city starts off on a

378
00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:30.350
Monday morning with, you know,
500 to a thousand headlines

379
00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:32.180
that have been pitched by
the full time and contributing

380
00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:34.970
staff and a smaller group
of full time. People goes

381
00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:36.830
through that and calls that
list down to about a

382
00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:39.110
hundred. That means that a
lot of funny things are

383
00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:42.680
not being said, that's right,
Because you want to, there's

384
00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:44.930
a lot of reasons for
rejection. One, one of the

385
00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:47.750
primary ones is that it's
not funny. Okay. And a

386
00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:50.000
group of people deciding what's
funny is a very high

387
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.190
bar. You have to make
everybody in that room be

388
00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:54.890
in agreement. So sensibility, you
know, that's a tough line.

389
00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:58.520
Also things that have been
said before, That's my question.

390
00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:01.660
What if someone just had
a memory, a sense memory.

391
00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:02.870
They did. They thought they
thought they came up with

392
00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:05.690
something completely unique. Yeah. But
we did that a year

393
00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:07.580
ago. We that we don't
do it again. How do

394
00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:08.930
you know that they used
to count on the collective

395
00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:10.310
to figure it out. Okay.
There is a, I mean,

396
00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:13.130
we still have people who
write for the union who

397
00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:15.380
have been there since almost
it started. It started in

398
00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:19.760
1988 at university of Wisconsin
and Madison as a campus

399
00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:23.510
paper is 22 years old.
I think the oldest staff

400
00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:26.750
writers, we have probably joined
around 90. So they've been

401
00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:29.300
around since the beginning. So
there's that rare memory. But

402
00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:32.570
we also have a search
engine that we have an

403
00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:36.830
onion search engine that was
just on our website. And

404
00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:38.330
where are you going to
go tell the being people

405
00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:40.310
to watch out because they
don't need search engines. Our

406
00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:42.440
search engine would wreak havoc
on the world in a

407
00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:46.550
good way. Not a bad
idea. Now I noticed you

408
00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:49.190
yesterday wandering around with an
iPad. And you said tablet,

409
00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:52.580
experiences just now, but you
kind of corrected yourself. Yeah.

410
00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:56.480
You're imagining what a tablet
experience with that. The reason

411
00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:59.930
I corrected myself is I'm
a little worried from a

412
00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:04.010
consumer or let's call them
citizens or people. There's another

413
00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:06.740
word for them. Other than
consumer, that we haven't washed

414
00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:11.330
them users, losers. What have
you and producers and coders

415
00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:16.970
that the amplify, the application
of our internet experiences is

416
00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:21.140
somewhat troubling. It's expensive. It
doesn't scale. And you end

417
00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:24.470
up having to customize so
much that you it's difficult

418
00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:26.690
to apply learning from one
space to another. Whereas we

419
00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:30.440
have this thing called the
internet, which is Why would

420
00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:33.860
you want an onion app
and not simply a custom

421
00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:36.950
site they can bookmark, right?
Yeah. I mean, there is

422
00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:39.470
a financial reason to do
that. You know, people have

423
00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:41.660
shown a willingness to pay
for apps in a way

424
00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:45.110
that is not as easily,
you know, replicated on the

425
00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:48.430
web itself. But you're, you're,
you're saying that because The

426
00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:52.330
great unwashed we'll pay 99 cents
to get effectively an RSS

427
00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:56.740
reader that says the onion,
rather than simply going add

428
00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:59.170
to homescreen and clicking on
it, that we will take

429
00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:02.100
their money. I mean, w
we'll take people's money just

430
00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:06.000
because we'll take their money.
But in terms of, I

431
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.430
think what w why you
also used the word experience,

432
00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:11.490
because it's not supposed to
be just an RSS reader

433
00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:14.220
and on any tablet. Now
you can go to our

434
00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:16.200
website. It looks pretty good.
I mean, it looks great

435
00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:18.150
on the iPad that I
haven't seen a Chrome tablet

436
00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:20.490
yet, but I'm sure it'll
look pretty good there too.

437
00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:23.700
The real question is how
do you take advantage of

438
00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:26.400
the unique properties of this,
these new devices? They have

439
00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:30.630
gyroscopes in them. You can
touch them. The screens are

440
00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:32.930
larger than a foam, but
smaller than a computer, which

441
00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:37.320
has this weird, lovely bones
in between space and not

442
00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:40.050
quite alive. It's to charisma
for the lovely bones tie

443
00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:44.820
in. I must say Peter Jackson
is no math. Yeah. So

444
00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:48.600
there are, there are some
fun things you could imagine

445
00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:51.030
that an iPhone can't do
and that a computer, a

446
00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:54.090
full on laptop or desktop
can't do that. A tablet

447
00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:57.450
might offer you. And so
we, haven't made a full

448
00:21:57.450 --> 00:21:59.340
decision on how we're going
to approach that, but I

449
00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:02.550
can tell you that the
idea of using the internet,

450
00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:05.730
you know, HTML five and
CSS three, and the latest

451
00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:09.030
of those standards to create
a compelling reading and viewing

452
00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:12.330
and listening experience is great.
And then maybe there'll be

453
00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:17.970
apps around some truly Unique
experiences. Okay. Gaming experience something

454
00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:21.210
else, but just reading the
onion is probably not something

455
00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:23.880
that we're going to keep
putting inside of apps and

456
00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:27.230
trying to charge for, because
that's expensive Us on the

457
00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:30.330
expensiveness is the thing that
bothers me the most is

458
00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:32.880
that this explosion of screen
sizes, I mean, I just

459
00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:35.400
got a 30 inch screen.
Yeah. And now everyone's back

460
00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:39.060
designing for 1,024. Again, this
is just, you know, eight

461
00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:41.310
more sites that I need
to No, I mean, it's

462
00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:43.920
hard enough trying to support
E and to have to

463
00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:48.450
apologize, go, and not all
versions, but you know, six

464
00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:51.390
months. Yeah. I'm working on
it. Yeah. Good. I'm working

465
00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:53.160
nine is going to be
pretty high. Good. Yeah. I

466
00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:55.770
like, I like things that
are pretty high. Oh, a

467
00:22:56.670 --> 00:23:00.450
black center. And we just
holding it down, back into

468
00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:05.970
<inaudible>, but the amount of
work that's involved, are we

469
00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:07.890
in an, are we at
an end point right now?

470
00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:10.080
Or are we in an
inter intermediate, we in a

471
00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:13.380
lovely bones place in between
the big screen and the

472
00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:15.900
small screen? Cause it seems
like CSS at three and

473
00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:18.870
HTML five might make it.
So we could scale sites

474
00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:23.970
with one set of markup.
I think we were Popular

475
00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:26.790
to think. And maybe to
say that we're in this

476
00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:31.260
transition, I think we're actually
in a permanent transition as

477
00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:34.800
far as technology's effect on
pretty much everything we do.

478
00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:38.100
I want to talk about,
you know, designing experiences for

479
00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:41.850
screens or visual access, because
it's not just going to

480
00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:46.100
be screens where the contacts
are coming, the heads up

481
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:48.500
display, augmented reality glasses are
coming and that's going to

482
00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:51.250
be a whole nother. Yeah.
And where the hell is

483
00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:55.870
my Jetpack. Yeah. I dunno.
I don't, I don't actually

484
00:23:55.870 --> 00:23:59.380
want that with a liability.
The traffic jams in the

485
00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:03.790
air, like this is not
a good look. So that's

486
00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:06.280
the, if you see how
much trouble we're going to

487
00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:08.770
have, and you look at
the resources that companies have,

488
00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:11.650
the individuals have to try
to explore these most don't

489
00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:14.050
most people, aren't the New York
times with an R and

490
00:24:14.050 --> 00:24:17.740
D department to try to
push the envelope. If you're

491
00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:20.410
a blogger, like people tell
me this conference, there's gotta

492
00:24:20.410 --> 00:24:22.960
be a better, more standard
way for these things to

493
00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:25.810
scale. And you were saying
that you recently outsourced your

494
00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:27.460
tech stuff anyway, cause you
were getting overwhelmed. I mean,

495
00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:30.280
you're a content producer. Yeah.
And I mean, I've done

496
00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:32.080
that in two ways. So
in Jack and Jill politics,

497
00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:34.150
I used to be the
tech dude for that blog.

498
00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:37.000
I did the WordPress install.
I did the finding of

499
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.810
the host. I did the
discus install plugins, and I'm

500
00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:43.330
just not reliable enough. I
can't get that call or

501
00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:45.250
that email at three in
the morning. Cause I'm doing

502
00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:47.560
too many other things. I'm
a bad choice. So we

503
00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:50.170
found somebody who was better
than me who wanted to

504
00:24:50.170 --> 00:24:53.200
be able to play. And
he's working with us in

505
00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:56.140
my personal site bear today.com.
I used to host that

506
00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:59.050
and manage that. And WordPress,
again, I went to Squarespace

507
00:24:59.890 --> 00:25:02.800
because it's just easier to
CMS and hosting all and

508
00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:05.830
you know, design kind of
all in one. Right? And

509
00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:09.010
that allows me to focus
on the content, which is

510
00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:12.040
my core. I still want
to keep a toe in

511
00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:15.490
tech just cause I thought
I'll become too stupid. But

512
00:25:15.490 --> 00:25:17.890
I also know that not
a programmer, that's not my

513
00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:20.800
core competency. So as long
as I say, smarter than

514
00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:24.760
the people I'm around that,
don't do tech. There's some

515
00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:26.260
value in that. And as
long as I still talk

516
00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:28.420
to tech, people there's value
in that, but I'm not

517
00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:32.140
going to be this tech
Ninja ever again, those days

518
00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:34.540
are over. Do you think
that the app store model

519
00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:36.730
is going to going to
scale? I mean, right now

520
00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:40.420
it's a mess. It's not
Microsoft. Apple always runs around

521
00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:42.280
saying we have X number
of thousand, hundreds of thousands

522
00:25:42.670 --> 00:25:44.290
and you know, and the
windows phone seven's coming out

523
00:25:44.290 --> 00:25:45.580
and we're going to have
an app store and we're

524
00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:48.070
going to have an app
store. I can't find a

525
00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:51.850
thing on the app store.
They are horrible Places. I

526
00:25:51.850 --> 00:25:54.130
mean, I'm a big Apple
fan and I hate Apple

527
00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:56.080
as much as I love
them. And one of the

528
00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:59.440
reasons I hate them more
than say a Microsoft who

529
00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:01.870
I've been a fan and
a critic of as well,

530
00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:05.260
more critic because that's the
fun thing to do is

531
00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:10.480
that Apple pretends to have
this flawless standard, they put,

532
00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:14.530
they see themselves as condescendingly,
better than everything else that's

533
00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:17.560
out there. So when they
have a bad experience, that's

534
00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:21.820
worse because they've said they
only create perfect experiences in

535
00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:24.790
the app store. There is
no way to sort apps

536
00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:28.600
by user ratings. That must
be by thought. I mean

537
00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:31.450
they think these things out,
don't they? Why would you

538
00:26:31.450 --> 00:26:35.140
hide that? They collect user
ratings. I want to find

539
00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:41.050
the most popular highest. Yeah.
That's because the app store

540
00:26:41.050 --> 00:26:43.030
owners know that as soon
as it goes down to

541
00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:47.370
four stars, it's over, it's
over everything that you've worked

542
00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:49.350
on. It's like these poor
video game guys that worked

543
00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:52.290
for 18 months on some
games, but they pour their

544
00:26:52.290 --> 00:26:54.870
lives into it. And then
they get that 7.9 from

545
00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:56.850
X-Box masons. It's not going
to happen for you. Sorry,

546
00:26:56.850 --> 00:27:00.090
go home goodbye. Try again.
Or bet you it's pressure

547
00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:02.210
from the app. The fact
that you have to go

548
00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:05.450
to a store to begin
with is a very frustrating

549
00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:07.910
expose on Android. You can
provide a, this fancy thing

550
00:27:07.910 --> 00:27:12.380
it's called a URL, Really
universal resource locator Magical. And

551
00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:15.080
what happens is you post
that like in an email

552
00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:17.600
newsletter that you have to
maybe hundreds of thousands. Yeah.

553
00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:20.390
So like maybe anywhere the
hell you want to, You

554
00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:22.220
can put it on this
other place. It's called the

555
00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:24.680
internet really? And then people
click on it and they

556
00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:28.010
can access the content, click
on it. And the URL

557
00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:31.370
you connect the user end
consumer directly to the publisher.

558
00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:35.570
That's a model that we
should try to replicate it.

559
00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:37.610
You don't need an additional
layer of software to get

560
00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:40.640
there. We should replicate that
except we should centralize everything.

561
00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:43.730
And then maybe take 30%
just for, just for the,

562
00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:47.330
Oh, you'll create the separate.
Yeah. Some kind of a,

563
00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:49.910
like a mall. No, I
was like, I think it's

564
00:27:49.910 --> 00:27:51.860
like more of a story.
More of a story. Yeah.

565
00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:56.060
Yeah. So those types of
things are frustrating and I

566
00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:58.850
kind of want, and I
know they do these things

567
00:27:58.850 --> 00:28:00.770
for a reason. They have
a particular vision, but there's

568
00:28:00.770 --> 00:28:03.260
a certain anal retentiveness to
some of this that is

569
00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:08.180
an unproductive for consumers, for
publishers, for developers as well.

570
00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:12.080
And the uncertainty around it,
you know, creates a weird

571
00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:14.210
market. Well, these are people's
lives. I mean, you always

572
00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:16.670
hear about the app developer
who got their app yanked

573
00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:18.290
or the app has been
in the store for nine

574
00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:20.330
weeks or something like that.
And you have to build

575
00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:22.040
it before it's project. You
said that you, you think

576
00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:24.530
they have a vision, but
for most companies like for

577
00:28:24.530 --> 00:28:26.990
like GE there's a company,
I don't know anything about

578
00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:30.680
I'll bet you that their
vision is stockholder value make

579
00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:34.850
a buttload of money. Yeah.
Is Apple's goal to make

580
00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:36.920
a buttload of money or
is it like to build

581
00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:40.070
Skynet? I mean, are they,
they must have something that's

582
00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:43.310
beyond money that they're trying
to do. Probably Google's closer

583
00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:45.800
to Skynet. Yeah. They have
kind of a messianic thing

584
00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:48.200
or we're all a part
of it. We're all Skynet.

585
00:28:48.290 --> 00:28:51.110
Actually. That's the beauty of
it. You are Skynet yours.

586
00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:53.720
You're right. It's going to
be, you know, the apocalypse

587
00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:58.150
will be crowdsourced. Yeah, absolutely.
I like that. You're like,

588
00:28:58.550 --> 00:28:59.750
I'm going to do that.
I give that talk. I

589
00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:01.610
actually, I sit here first,
so you can't steal it.

590
00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:05.570
No, I will cite it.
He will sign and link

591
00:29:05.570 --> 00:29:09.560
back. That's true. Apple's vision.
You know, obviously they were

592
00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:12.380
wondering the business of making
money, but they also have

593
00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:15.080
a peculiar experience that they're
going for. And you can

594
00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:17.210
see it in the types
of apps that get rejected.

595
00:29:17.210 --> 00:29:19.520
You can see there's no
porn in the store. That

596
00:29:19.850 --> 00:29:24.800
is a cleanliness that, that
they aspire to in their

597
00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:29.270
design and in what they
allow and disallow that is,

598
00:29:29.270 --> 00:29:33.350
you know, a bit nannyish
I think condescending was the

599
00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:34.760
word you went for that
I really liked because it

600
00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:39.470
is a sense that yeah,
Trust me. One of my

601
00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:42.010
more popular early YouTube videos
it's called, I hate the

602
00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:44.920
smugness of Apple because I
was, I had a major

603
00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:48.490
failure trying to install their
software. And the response that

604
00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:51.010
I got from the other
built in triggers in the

605
00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:54.790
software assumed I'm an idiot,
the message boards I went

606
00:29:54.790 --> 00:29:57.250
to to ask for help.
Oh, all those people support

607
00:29:57.250 --> 00:29:59.110
for, I assumed I was
an idiot and I'm like,

608
00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:01.060
no, I know how to
use a computer. I've been

609
00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:03.970
doing this since I was
six. So this is not

610
00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:06.560
me. It's you? Like, you're
the problem in the relationship.

611
00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:08.860
Right? And then in the
midst of this, I saw

612
00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:10.540
one of those. I get
a Mac commercials and go

613
00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:12.880
back, I'm a PC. You
max, just work. I'm like

614
00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:16.930
this, isn't just working. And
so the crowd reaction was

615
00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:21.040
very full of zealotry. Very
much like speaking out against

616
00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:25.240
Allah or Muhammad and finding
the reaction to that from

617
00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:27.400
other cultures. So that's what
I felt from the Apple

618
00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:30.120
crowd. I had a fun
time, Two things that reminds

619
00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:32.100
me of, I was at
the Apple store a couple

620
00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:34.470
of a couple of months
ago and it was packed

621
00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:37.680
and they were the economy's
in the toilet. And they

622
00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:40.320
did announce that the unemployment
numbers were over 10. Yeah.

623
00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:44.370
And I mentioned the young
Apple, you know, hippie chick

624
00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:47.340
that worked there. This really
is, you guys are so

625
00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:52.560
packed and she's like, yeah,
it's recession proof. Yep. The

626
00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:55.140
perf the profundity of that,
it just hit me like

627
00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:57.420
a slap in the face.
I mean, she was like,

628
00:30:57.990 --> 00:31:00.510
cause she just said it's
recession-proof and I just heard,

629
00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:03.540
you know, the lemmings will
buy anything from us. Do

630
00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:06.870
it. It was pretty amazing.
I'll be selling gym. And

631
00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:08.940
then as far as people
thinking that you're an idiot,

632
00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:11.700
we were working on this
thing, me and my minions,

633
00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:16.110

the code word. Okay. And
you just don't tell anybody

638

people. So you call in

639
00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:32.830

IP address. You want to

on the internet. Now I

645
00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:51.300

major problem. One site was

inaccessible and I did all
kinds of tests and I

647
00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:57.570
called up and I just
it's something I said about,

648
00:31:57.630 --> 00:31:59.040
I think it was the
way I said the word

649
00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:00.810
router. Like, I don't know.
They were just, something was

650
00:32:00.810 --> 00:32:04.860
like, Oh, this guy knows
things. I can talk to

651
00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:07.500
