today@raygun.com. That's our a Y
G U n.com. Hi, this

11
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.290
is Scott Hanselman. This Hansel
minutes today. I'm talking with

12
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.530
Tomomi an open web advocate
in the front end engineer.

13
00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:04.290
She works@slackrightnowandyoucancheckheroutatgirlymac.com, but most importantly,
the HTTP status cats. I

14
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.300
remember that. How are you?
Hi. Yeah, and I'm fine.

15
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.810
All right. How about you?
I'm very, very well all

16
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.150
by myself here in this,
in this time where we're

17
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.730
all sequestered and staying away
from humans. It's always nice

18
00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.270
to talk to humans on
a podcast. Hope you're staying

19
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:29.330
safe, where you are. Yeah.
So I'm looking@http.cat that not.com.cat.

20
00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.450
What is the story behind
HTTP status cat. All right.

21
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.680
That it's all started. And
no, when I was working

22
00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.970
at HP, that was long
time ago. It's a privilege

23
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.020
idiots ago and it was
a crazy time for me

24
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.740
because I was working initially
or working at a company

25
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.400
called the Palm at the
Palm level team and a

26
00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.200
company. I love my job
at that time too, but

27
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.130
company got acquired by HP.
And at that time we

28
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.340
had a CEO who was
interested in approach on the

29
00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.990
product, but you know, that's
a lot, a lot of

30
00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:13.370
happen. So CEO got ousted,
we get a new CEO.

31
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.660
Then the new CEO didn't
really care about what we

32
00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.080
do or like the product
itself. So we had a,

33
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.610
some uncertain time. Like we
weren't sure if we should

34
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.700
resume or, you know, the
project or not. So the

35
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.590
full, why I didn't really
have a lot of work

36
00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.170
to do, to be honest,
I was just pulling in

37
00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.480
an office, Brazilian internet, like,
you know, looking for some

38
00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.410
funny cat videos and cat
pictures like everybody else does.

39
00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.070
And then of course, you
know, when you're browsing, I

40
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.630
go, whatever the webpages, sometimes
you get full forward, you

41
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.480
know, the page and Alfond
then I was like, you

42
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.650
know, got a wild idea.
Like, you know what, maybe

43
00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.330
what if I put a
picture of cat? So since

44
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.380
it's full for maybe just
cat hiding and somewhere. Yeah.

45
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.310
It's fun. So then yeah,
of course my imagination goes

46
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.080
wild. So I started thinking
about, Hmm, what about for

47
00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.830
a it's unauthorized? Right. So
I was looking for the

48
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.840
cat who got banned from
entering a store or something

49
00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.060
like that and like full
nine it's conflict. So I

50
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.060
find a picture of two
cats fighting and things like

51
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.020
that. And I got, of
course we gap for 18.

52
00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.590
I am a teapot cat,
cat, get a teapot. Of

53
00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.130
course. So, yeah. So I
just started doing all that

54
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.910
silly things. It's a cat
pictures and the magically, Whoa.

55
00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.830
It could get a lot
of collections, you know, like

56
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.950
if I have a hundred,
it's like everything. So I

57
00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.830
post it, I think I
use a flicker at the

58
00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.730
time. Flicka was babied all
that time. So I posted

59
00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.730
those pictures of liquor and,
Oh my gosh. Now all

60
00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.920
of a sudden, I mean,
of course I tweeted too,

61
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:07.480
then it got so popular,
like in overnight in a

62
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.440
net building next day, like
people, somebody from Mashable was

63
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.340
contacting me and somebody from
like, I think let's see

64
00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.940
it and tech and everywhere.
And so it gets viral.

65
00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.230
Yeah. And the cool thing
was community helped pick it

66
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:26.920
up. So a lot of
people interested and created the

67
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:32.320
API APIs or like Apache
config or, or even some

68
00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.810
variants, like HDP status dogs
or like HD be like,

69
00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:44.050
it'd be unsaved version. And
then there's a one on

70
00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:49.630
guy, I think his name
to <inaudible> and Lisbon. And

71
00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.710
he actually got duck cat
domain name to host those

72
00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.490
photos extra. He wrote API,
still use that cat pictures

73
00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:02.470
do and yeah. So he
got this hdp.cat domain. I

74
00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.280
was like, wow, that's awesome.
Cause I can't get that

75
00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.300
domain because you have to
host some capitalism language or

76
00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:15.390
capitalism culture of something. Right.
Isn't that a lawn region,

77
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:20.550
cat catalog. When you go
to http.cat, you just say

78
00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.340
slash four Oh four slash
500 and then you get

79
00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.240
to get your cat. And
that page is actually available

80
00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.450
in Catalan language too, because
we have to, that's a

81
00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:34.530
requirement. So yeah. So that's
it. That's what it is.

82
00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:39.930
And it's been wild, but
people still discovering, you know,

83
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.710
like even not so funny
thing is that, you know,

84
00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.470
I work at Slack, but
we use a Slack at

85
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:51.390
Slack and this there's always,
some engineers find about, Hey,

86
00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:53.760
we find something cool. And
to somebody else, I was

87
00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.790
like, Oh yeah, Tomomi made
it. So it's always reacted.

88
00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:00.980
It was custom emoji, like
Tomomi emoji. So it happens

89
00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:05.750
like every like yeah. Often
time. I mean, it happens

90
00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:10.750
all the time. So yeah.
So I've, I noticed that

91
00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.310
that's been a couple of
years and it's a cute

92
00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:14.830
thing and it's nice to
kind of go viral and

93
00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:18.340
get your 15 minutes. Right.
But I saw that and

94
00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:19.960
I filed it away in
my mind and I said,

95
00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.900
that's interesting. And then I
noticed some of your sketch

96
00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.570
notes on how to do
get and there's cats. And

97
00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:28.630
then I went to your
GitHub and there's cats and

98
00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:31.540
your website and there's cats.
It seems like you don't

99
00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:33.580
do hello world. Like you
don't, you're not a hello

100
00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.220
world person. Everything has got
to have a cat. If

101
00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:38.950
it's going to be a
hello world example, It's like

102
00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:43.660
always Meow. So yeah. There's
many times when I tried

103
00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:47.470
some new API platform, I
just always tried to create

104
00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:52.210
something around the cats. I
love cats. And actually, even

105
00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:55.300
right now, if you hear
this noise, sorry, my cats

106
00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:58.360
are running around like crazy.
They just woke up and

107
00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.370
it was so Katzel was,
you know, part of my

108
00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:04.150
life. So yeah, many times
when I want to just

109
00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:06.700
try something new, it's like,
yeah. Why don't I use

110
00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:09.880
cats as the example now?
Yeah. I think that's really

111
00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:12.100
important to have like a
thing like that. Like I

112
00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.800
think it's hard. There's so
many technologies and so many

113
00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.430
things I could potentially learn
and I'm not inspired by

114
00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:21.520
hello world. Like making a
robot, say hello world, everyone's

115
00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.220
got their own thing. Like
your thing is cats. My

116
00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:27.130
thing is like my, my
diabetes and my blood sugar.

117
00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:30.430
So I have a web,
I have an HTTP rest

118
00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:33.190
API for my blood sugar
and I can go and

119
00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:35.020
see my blood sugar in
real time. So if it's

120
00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:38.140
like, Hey, this is a
new LCD screen and a

121
00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:40.990
new ADA fruit, you know,
device, then show me my

122
00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:43.930
blood sugar. Or when Alexa
came out, I want to

123
00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:46.060
say, Alexa, show me my
blood sugar or the Apple

124
00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:48.910
watch comes out. I want
it on my watch. So

125
00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:51.070
you want cats on your
Apple watch and on Alexa

126
00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:53.290
and I want my blood
sugar. And I think it's

127
00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:56.380
important that everyone find that
thing, right? That, that passion

128
00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:59.470
that drives them to play
with technology. It's true because

129
00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:01.990
you don't, well, of course
you can always follow some

130
00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:05.290
tutorials out there just right.
The plain old hello world.

131
00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:07.870
But why not just combine
with something you love, you

132
00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:10.060
have a passion for it,
you know, that makes you

133
00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:13.360
know, easier to launch new
things and to just motivate

134
00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.210
you to create a more
things, you know? So yeah.

135
00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:19.120
A while back you did,
that was a couple of

136
00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:24.070
years ago you did a
cat faced detection. It's key

137
00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:28.300
to kill him. Yeah. Yeah.
Kitty cat cam. And you

138
00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:31.030
know, when the raspberry PI
three came out, you said,

139
00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:33.310
Oh, faster CPU. I'm going
to go and upgrade kitty

140
00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:37.370
cam. Whenever I see tutorials
like that, I wonder if,

141
00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:39.520
if people who are listening
to our show here, think

142
00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:41.470
the same thing where it's
like, Oh, that sounds hard.

143
00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:44.350
There's so many different things
to plug in. They're going

144
00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:48.190
to do, you know, image
detection and then do something

145
00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:51.160
about it and hardware and
wiring. But when I read

146
00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.940
through the details on your
blog, it was really about

147
00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:59.930
bringing together libraries that were
already, already done. Right. Right.

148
00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:03.290
So I actually wanted to
show people like, I am

149
00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:06.260
not an expert, you know,
I'm well, how do I

150
00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.960
add the Wyoming? And everything's
fun, but I, to be

151
00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:12.230
honest, I really don't know
much about it, you know,

152
00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:15.590
but I just, you know,
try, you know, this, the

153
00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:18.080
same thing, the hello world
and try it a hell

154
00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.540
of a world. But I'm
like, yeah. I'm like, what

155
00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:24.080
can I do with cats?
You know? So I think

156
00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:27.350
again, just writing, hello, world's
kind of boring. So sooner

157
00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:30.800
or later I just come
up with some project. And

158
00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.200
of course my project is
always about a cat, so

159
00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:37.760
I'm like, Hmm, what can
I do? And then, you

160
00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:40.100
know, I learned I could
use a camera coming up.

161
00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.370
Kamilah mojos who is the
raspberry PI. And then I

162
00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:46.640
started lining so much about
sensors. You know, what kind

163
00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.610
of like emotional sensors or
maybe proximity, sensors, all kinds

164
00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:54.050
of stuff. It's a whole
like motivated by what I

165
00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:56.360
wanted to create, you know,
that time, like, I really

166
00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:00.590
wanted to have something like
Kel camera. Then I learned

167
00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:04.880
about this open source library
about CA facial detection. That

168
00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:07.820
sounds really funny. It sounds
like I'm joking about it.

169
00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:11.450
It really is. It's like
full, at least I can

170
00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:15.140
write software, you know, by
the way, I'm an amateur,

171
00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:17.480
but for the software part,
at least I know how

172
00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:19.330
to write a no JS.
I'm like, Oh, can I

173
00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:22.280
want to just use it?
So I just, you know,

174
00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:25.040
make it work. I mean,
just using a third party

175
00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:28.610
library and I make it
a work and I just

176
00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:31.940
put it all together and
I'm done. I mean, it's

177
00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:36.500
not done. I can always
improve. I guess something, you

178
00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:38.540
know, That's the kind of
project you can do in

179
00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:40.400
a weekend. Right? You don't
need to take weeks for

180
00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.890
those kinds of things. Yeah.
I use my week. Yeah.

181
00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:45.650
So I was so into,
you know, it's absorbed myself.

182
00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:48.590
So I spent, Oh, I
don't know how many weekends

183
00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:52.400
I spend because like, you
know, getting everything, that's something

184
00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:56.210
I learned from scratch. I'm
annoying experts. I hit some

185
00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:59.090
friends. I get asked what
advice, but still, you know,

186
00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:02.090
it's all about learning. So
when I'm done with this,

187
00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:05.030
I'm like, yeah. Why don't
like just, she had what

188
00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:07.760
I've learned. You know, I
just didn't want to put

189
00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:11.210
that and get hub and,
you know, just show people

190
00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:13.040
like a here. That's what
I meant. It's more like

191
00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:15.620
I wanted to, you know,
write down like a whole

192
00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:20.060
instruction. So other people could
create too. And in fact,

193
00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:22.820
people actually did, you know,
on the phone, my approach,

194
00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:25.940
I mean, disagree have repo
and created something by them,

195
00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:29.990
by themselves too. So that's
pretty difficult. Yeah. Yeah. So

196
00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:34.220
the, the, the kitty Dar
like radar, but face detection

197
00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:37.310
for cats that Heather Arthur
did, it's not, not maintained

198
00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:39.440
anymore, but it's a couple
of years old. And you

199
00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.660
know, you, you plugged all
these things together. You took

200
00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:45.520
the raspberry, PI the facial
detection, the camera, then you

201
00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:47.600
pushed it up to the
cloud. So you basically made

202
00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:50.990
a, a cam that would
watch when your cats came

203
00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:53.380
by. You like watch them,
you watch them remotely from

204
00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:57.040
work. If the catheter Was
no it's unplugged, but yes,

205
00:11:57.070 --> 00:12:02.320
I I've been monitoring for
awhile. Yeah. And that time

206
00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:05.890
actually, I was working at
some startups. So I use

207
00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:11.110
a technology that, you know,
we were actually creating. So

208
00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:14.980
you, yeah. I'm looking at
my GitHub repo right now,

209
00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:18.330
but yeah. It's like, I,
Well, that's another good example.

210
00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:20.640
You were using the technology
that your company already works

211
00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.520
on. Right? So like, you
know, I work at Microsoft

212
00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:25.980
and I work on Azure,
so I want to move

213
00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:28.380
my blog to Azure. And
then if a new thing,

214
00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:30.570
a new feature comes out,
then I will go and

215
00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:34.260
apply it to my life
rather than just messing around

216
00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.960
with the feature. I want
to really try it. You

217
00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:40.020
know, if I want to
do a bot or Slack

218
00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:41.640
bot or a team's bot,
and I'm going to plug

219
00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:43.590
it into my life and
not just a hello world

220
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:48.050
bot. Yeah. So that Tommy,
I was working in the

221
00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:51.180
company, like a startup called
the PubNub when you're doing

222
00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:56.130
some, you know, the real
time communications. So I use

223
00:12:56.130 --> 00:13:03.360
that. Yeah. So I could
actually get those images from

224
00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:06.810
raspberry PI to elsewhere as
I could monitor on like

225
00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:12.300
browsers extra, not just me,
anyone could breaths because that

226
00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:16.140
time he had a public
URL. So anyone could watch

227
00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:19.530
my cat. Yeah. I think
I pull it off for

228
00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:24.840
now, but cause it's so
much privacy. Yeah. But Do

229
00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:27.420
you ever worry about putting
those things online? Do you

230
00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:30.060
ever worry about those projects?
Like sometimes people will listen

231
00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:32.190
to the show will say,
I don't feel comfortable putting

232
00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:35.430
my hobby online because people
might judge it and say,

233
00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:40.740
Oh, that's Yeah. Well that
happens actually. But you know,

234
00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:43.470
that's still you. And I
take it as a feedback

235
00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:48.600
because I don't consider, I'm
just always giving up or

236
00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:51.900
just sharing whatever, because I
can learn from other people

237
00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:55.740
too. So I actually made
a lot of good online

238
00:13:55.740 --> 00:14:00.420
friends who could teach me
things too. Yeah. And recently

239
00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:04.980
I extra tweet about some
doodling stuff and, you know,

240
00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:08.580
I thought I kind of
understood the subject correctly, but

241
00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:10.650
turns out I had a
mistake that I didn't even

242
00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:13.470
know. And there are a
lot of people who, you

243
00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:16.560
know, I don't fortunately know
actually send me a messages

244
00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:19.800
and my DMSO was open.
So some people have DME

245
00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:23.130
about that to correct me
in reading nicely and try

246
00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:26.370
to even show me some
examples and references too. So

247
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.810
actually I don't mind if
somebody say that, well, if

248
00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:34.920
somebody tells me nicely, you
know, if somebody just, you

249
00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:37.140
know, the Twitter and I
say, Oh, you suck and

250
00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:39.660
I'm going to cry. But
you know, as long as

251
00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:43.950
people are nice about it.
Yeah. Yeah. I try to,

252
00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:47.190
I try to make people,
as I try to facilitate

253
00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:51.000
a kind image around myself,
if I'm being positive, then

254
00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:53.510
will be positive. If people
are going to be cruel,

255
00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:55.760
then I block block and
move on. You know, I

256
00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:57.940
don't need any negativity in
my life. Right. As I

257
00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:00.880
just don't feed the trolls,
like I just don't deal

258
00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:03.820
with, if somebody is nasty
about it, I'm like, great.

259
00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:06.310
You're smarter than me. Well,
at least you think so,

260
00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:09.850
but I don't care. So
move on. Yeah. So I'm

261
00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:13.750
fine with the, When you
need to focus on building,

262
00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:15.760
do you want to get
bogged down by your database?

263
00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:19.330
Mongo DB is an intuitive,
flexible document database that lets

264
00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:22.510
you get to building Mongo.
DBS document model is a

265
00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:24.910
natural way to represent data
so you can focus on

266
00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:28.210
what matters. Mongo DB Atlas
is the best way to

267
00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:31.750
use Mongo DB. It's a
global cloud database service that

268
00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:34.270
gives you all of the
developer productivity of Mongo DB.

269
00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:38.110
Plus the added simplicity of
a fully managed database service.

270
00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:44.410
You can get started free
with Mongo DB atlas@mongodb.com slash

271
00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:48.220
Atlas. So when, when I
look at your, your sketch

272
00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:51.190
notes though, here's another thing
like your, your, you do

273
00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:54.430
your developing node. You go
online, you give presentations, you

274
00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:56.230
do a lot of stuff.
And then you have these

275
00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:58.420
really nice sketch notes. And
every time I see someone's

276
00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:01.420
sketch notes, I feel sad
because I don't have this

277
00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:05.560
ability. Like I can't make
this pretty handwriting and pictures

278
00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:08.020
and stuff. Or are you
an artist or is that,

279
00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:09.730
how do you know how
to do gets notes? Cause

280
00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:13.150
I'm always envious. I love
design and art, but I

281
00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:17.380
actually never had a formal
training. You know? So I

282
00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:21.580
didn't, yeah. I actually still
learning. But the funniest thing

283
00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:25.390
is that, well, it's my
background. So I was born

284
00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:29.020
and born and raised in
Japan. And as a kid,

285
00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:32.650
I used to be reading
a lot of manga, which

286
00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:35.230
is a comic books equivalent
in here in the U

287
00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:39.160
S but I just prefer
cold because the Japanese one

288
00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:43.510
is quite different. But anyway,
so yeah, so I was

289
00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:47.740
always, well, let's get in
trouble for my parents that

290
00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:50.650
don't, they didn't like me
reading all the time, but

291
00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:53.980
I was so into. So
a lot of times, you

292
00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:58.120
know, we try to just
mimic, you know, just drawing

293
00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:01.870
or maybe tracing something like
from manga. So that's kind

294
00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:05.950
of complicated things that kids
in Japan do. So my

295
00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:09.340
brother was doing that too.
So it kinda naturally a

296
00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:13.420
quiet, like how to draw
by just copying or mimicking

297
00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:18.070
stuff for Munga book or
maybe anime. Oh, actually. And

298
00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:20.950
the funniest thing is other
thing is there's not always

299
00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:25.960
just among the parents. Didn't
like we have something like

300
00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:29.980
video educational ones, like something,
some Munga that you can

301
00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:34.810
learn a lot about history,
like Japanese and history is,

302
00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:38.590
or could be something like
a Chinese dynasty. That's a

303
00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:42.160
pop it along or even
French revolutions and stuff. So

304
00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:45.460
there's just so many more
than that, that you can

305
00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:50.610
learn from. So for me,
like education and like Munga,

306
00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:53.670
or doodling is always like,
I would witness the same

307
00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:57.420
thing, but it's always like
somewhere the same place in

308
00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:01.110
my brain, I would say.
So when I doodle or

309
00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:04.620
something, like, I dunno, it's
just natural for me. You

310
00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:08.070
know, when I launch something
new, I doodle and if

311
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:11.280
I'm going to teach somebody,
you know how to, I

312
00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:14.700
don't know, could be just
computer science or a logics

313
00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:19.530
or anything. I doodle, Oh,
actually, you know what? I

314
00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:25.290
remember something. So I'm actually
doing software engineering now, but

315
00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:30.150
after college, I, I had
different carrier. So that time

316
00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:34.800
I was working at a
research lab, extra microbiology lab,

317
00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:38.220
you know, that would be,
yeah. So we had a

318
00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:42.180
lot of research protocols and
lab protocols we had follow,

319
00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:45.690
and it's not like a
software engineering that you can

320
00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:49.130
create bugs and no one
dies, you know, full of

321
00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:53.610
like researching stuff. Any mistakes
can be really serious, costly

322
00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:56.790
and deadly. So we have
to make sure like everything's

323
00:18:56.790 --> 00:19:00.750
perfectly aligned and calculate it
and everything. And at that

324
00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:03.570
time, and let's complicate it.
And a lot of times

325
00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:07.800
like if people would just
join a new lab, couldn't

326
00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:11.160
really follow the procedure fine.
So I decided to draw

327
00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:15.480
pictures. So I had a
doodle, all the Petri dish,

328
00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:19.860
Flath Erlenmeyer flask, smell everything.
And after I extra drew

329
00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:22.590
it and I put this,
my doodle on a wall,

330
00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:27.870
actually everybody appreciated me. I
mean, every, everybody understood exactly

331
00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:31.830
like how the process should
go. So then I knew

332
00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:36.000
doodling really helps people along,
you know? So I think

333
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.720
I've been doing just like
my entire life. I would

334
00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:42.660
say like, no matter how
old I was or like,

335
00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:45.930
you know, career I had,
so now I'm in the

336
00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:50.060
software, but I still do
the same thing. Interesting. So

337
00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:52.310
you're taking notes for yourself
and then you start to

338
00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:54.230
do it in a certain
style, the style that you

339
00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:56.570
grew up with, and then
in the process, you share

340
00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:58.670
those online and people go
and say, Oh, I get

341
00:19:58.670 --> 00:20:01.060
it now. I, you, it
helps you understand. And then

342
00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:04.640
ultimately helps me understand it.
Okay. So when I asked

343
00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:06.590
the same thing and like
when I'm in a school,

344
00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:09.140
like when I was in
a high school, anything, you

345
00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:13.310
know, a teacher's explaining something.
I, I tend to doodle,

346
00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:17.150
maybe not. Well, maybe because
the teacher was boring CISE

347
00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:21.230
or doing something else, but
that's actually like a part

348
00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:26.150
of my learning process. So
I draw something and understand.

349
00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:29.180
And at the same night
when I was teaching people

350
00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:34.700
was showing something. That's how
I do. And it's easier

351
00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:37.670
for those. So many people
who, especially like a visual

352
00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:42.560
learners. I think those things
are really important. I think

353
00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:46.280
you've probably seen like Julia Evans
had some really popular zenes

354
00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:49.090
and she's done a lot
of really great visualizations to

355
00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:52.570
describe stuff. You've done a
great one in your get

356
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:57.190
recently your get cherry pick
and get commits, basically explaining,

357
00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:59.970
get with cartoon, cat. Yeah.
It's actually, I have a

358
00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:04.590
pum, so it's get pulled,
but to get pool and

359
00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:10.620
they get push for get,
but cherry-pick, I couldn't really

360
00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:15.120
come up with a good
cat. Yeah. There's not really

361
00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:17.490
a good one there for,
for, for cherry pick. Yeah.

362
00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:20.730
So get, it's actually really
hard, a difficult day alarm

363
00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:23.340
to, you know, because you
know, it's all started to,

364
00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:26.730
because I have not good
at it using get, and

365
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.920
even work my daily work.
Well, of course idea's good.

366
00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:35.010
But I sometimes screw up,
you know, especially when I

367
00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:36.840
went to, I do Marshall
and I had a lot

368
00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:40.170
of conflicts and stuff, so
I'm really frustrated. It was

369
00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:44.040
good. I thought I knew,
but it's just not reading

370
00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:47.070
it Every, every time I
think I know get, then

371
00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:49.020
I get in trouble. I
swear. I regularly am like,

372
00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:50.790
Oh yeah, I get it.
Now I get it now.

373
00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:53.220
And then I have to
cherry pick or I'm on,

374
00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:55.380
you know, you know the
thing when you're on one

375
00:21:55.650 --> 00:21:58.050
branch for a while you
do a bunch of work

376
00:21:58.050 --> 00:22:00.190
and you go, Oh crap.
That should have been another

377
00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:02.220
branch. You know, I've been
working for three hours and

378
00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:03.360
I need to take all
this and put it on

379
00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:06.180
the other side. And I
knew, yes, it's just not

380
00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:08.400
me. Right. Like everybody else
did in the same way.

381
00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:11.700
So I was like, whatever.
So I was actually doodling

382
00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:15.870
old for myself. I wasn't
thinking about like sharing, but

383
00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:19.050
I did anyways. I just
tweeted one day. So the

384
00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:22.260
very first one is really
crappy hand drawing, but I

385
00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:26.010
just shared on get hub
and everybody loved it. So

386
00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:28.710
that's how I know. It's
like, yes, cats work, you

387
00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:32.340
know, internet it's made with
cats plus EBITDA, but it's

388
00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:36.450
struggling with get, you know,
so I appreciate that. You're

389
00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:38.430
saying in, in many of
these different things, and I

390
00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:39.720
think this is a lot
of what I do as

391
00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:43.290
well as you're saying, okay,
this isn't that good. It

392
00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:45.990
was just for me, but
I could share it anyway.

393
00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:47.610
I think a lot of
people who might be listening

394
00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:50.190
might say, well, I don't
have a blog or nothing

395
00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:53.670
I do is useful or
interesting, but you, but you,

396
00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:55.350
you know, it's sad, isn't
it. But then you go

397
00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:58.320
and make a, a cat
detecting raspberry pie. You could

398
00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:01.020
have kept it to yourself,
but you write about, you

399
00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:03.060
make a, you make a
sketch note and you could've

400
00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:05.520
kept it to yourself, but
you're right about it. Why

401
00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:09.030
not? Yeah. I haven't really
want to have anybody to

402
00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:12.210
share their, you know, their
works, you know, not just

403
00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:15.900
the works, anything like you
launch. So like, I think

404
00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:19.500
the blog posts like technical
blog post, let's say it

405
00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:22.440
doesn't have to be perfect.
Right. It can't be just

406
00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:26.250
your note, but it just
a public not. And of

407
00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:29.070
course, if you have a
comments open, if it's something

408
00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:33.000
wrong, people can be nicely,
you know, like a correct.

409
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.520
You, if somebody is mean
and they can just shut

410
00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:39.240
this person off, but you
know, yeah. So actually, you

411
00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:42.510
know, that's how I started
blogging. That was a long

412
00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:44.700
time ago too. That a
lot of the time I

413
00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:48.410
wasn't posting my cat photos
or doodling, but just a

414
00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:52.010
note for myself, it was
something I've learned something. I

415
00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:57.980
tried something I experimented and
you never know who's reading

416
00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:01.130
and how, yeah. That something
like long time ago too.

417
00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:07.040
I remember when I what's
experiment them with then new

418
00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:10.760
CSF three features, I actually
run a lot of testing

419
00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:15.230
on Safari. And yeah, that
was like, is this animation

420
00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:18.500
or something 3d or something
like that? Can't remember. But

421
00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:22.760
the actually I never imagined,
but somebody from Apple who

422
00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:26.300
was working on Safari, I
actually saw my blog post

423
00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:28.940
and he thought it was
a really great test case.

424
00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:32.960
So actually the engineers there
did he use my blog

425
00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:36.140
post to file more bugs
and fix them. And I

426
00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:39.770
never imagined back in the
time that actually my blockbuster

427
00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:44.090
helped the product get better.
So I was really amazed

428
00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:47.150
and I was so happy
about this. And that actually

429
00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:50.150
really gave me a huge
motivation to write more. You

430
00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:53.630
know, of course not every
single blog post reached that

431
00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:57.560
many people or get much
impact. Maybe just some people

432
00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:01.100
just sit like, you know,
press the like button or

433
00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:05.090
whatever, but it's fine. I
mean, as long as you

434
00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:08.600
log on it and it
helps somebody else maybe fixing

435
00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:10.670
the bug, it was somebody
who was as a new,

436
00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:13.790
as you are, could learn
and benefit from it doesn't

437
00:25:13.790 --> 00:25:16.340
really matter. You know, it's,
I think it's just a

438
00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:19.160
great to keep sharing, keep
telling people what they been

439
00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:22.790
working on, you know, what
are you being like? Yeah.

440
00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:24.950
What are you doing? Even
experiments like I did, that's

441
00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:27.880
not have to be like
full-fledged floor for the active

442
00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:31.690
project. Anything, You know, I
was talking about that recently

443
00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:33.880
and I said, someone told
me that they had 15

444
00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:38.080
blog posts that they were
in draft and they had,

445
00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:41.350
they were thinking about blogging
about them, but they were

446
00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:44.440
like, yeah, I want to
get it perfect. And honestly,

447
00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:47.830
I would much rather have
15, 80% log posts than

448
00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:51.400
one perfect blog. Don't you
think? Yeah. I agree. Well,

449
00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:53.550
it's such a waste. You
can just put it into

450
00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:56.800
a draft and no one
else ever sees that. Oh

451
00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:59.830
yeah. The problem is though
one person says something mean,

452
00:25:59.830 --> 00:26:02.020
and it can really ruin
your whole day. And it's,

453
00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:04.150
it's hard to have the
energy to be able to

454
00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:08.920
just say, you know, whatever
the haters and move on.

455
00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:11.800
But, but I was someone
told me once they said,

456
00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:14.230
Hey, has Scott, how can
I become like a popular

457
00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:16.540
blogger? And I said, I
don't know about that. But

458
00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:19.660
if you just blog a
little bit, every week for

459
00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:23.620
20 years, you'll be a
mediocre, middle blogger like me.

460
00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:26.890
Right. It doesn't matter if
10 people read it or

461
00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:29.740
a million people read it.
If more than one person

462
00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:33.880
read it, then I've doubled
my power. Yeah. Like you

463
00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:37.540
don't have to be a
popular internet famous or anything,

464
00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:40.930
you know, as long as
even like appreciate or what

465
00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:44.100
you've done. And it says,
thank you. Just one. Thank

466
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:47.600
you. Has just enough for
me to be honest. That

467
00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:49.640
is a really good attitude.
One, thank you is enough.

468
00:26:50.030 --> 00:26:51.500
And I think that we
would, I think you and

469
00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:54.260
I agree that we should
encourage people to put little

470
00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:57.050
interesting things that they know.
People also say, I don't

471
00:26:57.050 --> 00:26:59.300
know if I want to
blog because what do I

472
00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:02.150
know? Why am I special?
I'm one of your blogs

473
00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:03.890
that you did last year
that I thought was really

474
00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:06.710
interesting that you didn't have
to blog it, but it

475
00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:09.560
was all about, tell me
if I'm saying this right.

476
00:27:09.650 --> 00:27:14.480
Ray. Woah. Yeah. Can you
tell me about what happened

477
00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:17.240
there and what's going on
because the emperor, like a

478
00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:20.840
Hito he left and then
what does that, how does

479
00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:24.290
that change the calendar? Gosh,
so, well let's, since I

480
00:27:24.290 --> 00:27:26.780
don't live in Japan anymore,
I'm so glad that I

481
00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:30.020
don't have to use their
actually special calendar, to be

482
00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:34.220
honest, I think it was
just the Gregorian calendar year

483
00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:38.090
2020 or whatever. But in
Japan I has an Embera

484
00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:44.150
and each emperor like in
embarrass era has the name

485
00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:49.040
that I don't know exactly
the, what the naming process

486
00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:52.370
is, but anyways, it's always
go through some process that

487
00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:55.760
gets new names. So now
they get a new emperor

488
00:27:55.820 --> 00:28:00.140
and that the arrow is
called up. They used to

489
00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:03.860
behave say, that means all
those engineers in Japan will

490
00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:07.190
have to, you know, work
in the States and time.

491
00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:09.860
It's the hardest things to
work on, you know, an

492
00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:15.620
engineering and yeah, the interesting
thing is now in, in

493
00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:22.310
JavaScript, we have international data
object and that's actually, like

494
00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:25.730
you said, it's international. So
it works in any, I

495
00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:28.940
think I would say like
any countries in the nations

496
00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:34.250
and it works with the
special Japanese calendar system too.

497
00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:37.490
But when I actually wrote
this, it was still not

498
00:28:37.490 --> 00:28:41.540
on you Arab. So on
the browser vendors haven't implemented

499
00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:44.510
it yet. So it was
actually already a roadie for

500
00:28:44.510 --> 00:28:47.630
fun and see if it's
going do Arctic in the

501
00:28:47.690 --> 00:28:52.310
near future. So it's all
working now. So it doesn't

502
00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:54.950
really benefit a whole lot
of people because like, again,

503
00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:58.250
if you live outside of
Japan, you will never need

504
00:28:58.250 --> 00:29:01.820
a special calendar in a
way, but it's just interesting

505
00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:07.940
backstories to Atlanta on some
technology that exists. You might

506
00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:10.790
not need to use it,
but it's just good to

507
00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:14.060
acknowledge What was cool about
it was that you, you

508
00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:15.770
put it into the context
of things that I do

509
00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:19.850
understand, right? It's like, here's
the daytime in JavaScript that

510
00:29:19.850 --> 00:29:24.860
I know. And here's Japanese
date system that I don't

511
00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:27.470
know. And then you combine
the two, right? And you

512
00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:30.200
take, you took two things
that, you know, and shared

513
00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:33.080
it with us. And that's
a way of, you know,

514
00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:35.030
coming up with a blog
post and a blog post

515
00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:38.450
topic, and also teaching me
something about another culture. Yeah.

516
00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:42.580
That's interesting. Right. Then I'm
glad I so glad that

517
00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:46.300
yeah. You learned something from
me. That's really, I appreciate

518
00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:49.360
that. Yeah. That's really old
and drives me to write

519
00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:52.450
more about, I should actually
write more blog because these

520
00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:57.520
days I haven't really written
a whole lot because actually

521
00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:01.510
like a blogging or writing
tutorials have become my actual

522
00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:04.800
carrier and I have to
do my work time. So

523
00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:08.500
I kinda spent less time
for my own blog or

524
00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:12.940
my own story and things
like that. That's a really

525
00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:15.610
tough situation. Cause I, you
know, I work for Microsoft

526
00:30:15.610 --> 00:30:18.580
and while my job isn't
necessarily writing, certainly putting content

527
00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:20.500
out there as a part
of it. And then you

528
00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:22.660
have to think about who
am I doing this content

529
00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:24.520
for? Is this a blog
for the work? Or is

530
00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:27.250
this a blog for my
own website and having your,

531
00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:31.210
your work and your life
be mixed together, online. And

532
00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:34.240
certainly on Twitter can be
very challenging, right? Yeah. But

533
00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:37.210
I was still lucky enough
that I'm actually doing a

534
00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:40.750
developer advocacy, you know, it's
a developer relations work. So

535
00:30:41.170 --> 00:30:44.290
I can kind of sort
of mix in some way.

536
00:30:44.290 --> 00:30:47.350
Of course I had to
draw some lines between a

537
00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:52.150
professional career and you know,
personal things, but it's still,

538
00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:59.110
you know, speaking at conferences
and writing some technical stuff.

539
00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:02.140
It's my job anyways. So
don't you think they should

540
00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:05.290
let you put more cats
in the documentation? So I

541
00:31:05.290 --> 00:31:10.450
lost, so I actually did.
Yeah. So I actually wrote

542
00:31:10.450 --> 00:31:13.870
some of the documentations on
API does like that com

543
00:31:13.930 --> 00:31:17.920
that was like a slacks
API page impasse. When I

544
00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:23.320
joined the company, what's like
2017. So you could actually

545
00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:27.580
detect which page I wrote
because every single documentation I

546
00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:30.070
wrote has cat picture or
cat photo. I mean the

547
00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:35.020
cap illustration or something like
that, but we replaced them

548
00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:37.630
with something a little more
professional. Oh, it's not about

549
00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:41.410
professional. Not simply because we
had a new branding after

550
00:31:41.410 --> 00:31:44.620
that. So we had to
replace all that screenshots and

551
00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:49.510
all of that assets. So
I don't think they, Oh,

552
00:31:49.630 --> 00:31:52.390
maybe some pages still have
cats. I would say two.

553
00:31:52.390 --> 00:31:56.560
They took all the fun
out some stupid. Yeah. And

554
00:31:59.710 --> 00:32:02.320
is actually really a friendly
and try to make it

555
00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:05.320
a friendly. So it's not
an old to deuce areas

556
00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:09.790
though. You probably still find
some cat pictures somewhere hidden.

557
00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:13.750
Well, hopefully, hopefully I'll see
some new blogs from you

558
00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:16.570
with more cats. And I
appreciate you chatting with me

559
00:32:16.570 --> 00:32:20.620
today. Thank you so much
for having me. I've been

560
00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:24.220
chatting with <inaudible> who has
brought her joy of cats

561
00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:27.400
and technology together online, and
we will see you again

562
00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:41.220
Next week. On another episode
of cancer, <inaudible>.
