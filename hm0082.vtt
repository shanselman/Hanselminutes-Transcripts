00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:09.110
program manager, Charlie. Oh, Hi,
this is Scott Hanselman, and

10
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.970
this is another episode of
Hansel minutes and I am

11
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.300
actually sitting in the Microsoft
building 42. This is my

12
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.830
first podcast as an employee
of Microsoft. Hopefully they know

13
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.320
the first of many as
I'm going to be interviewing

14
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.450
people from all over Microsoft
and giving people an inside

15
00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.940
view. And I'm sitting here
with my friend program manager,

16
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.390
Charlie Owen, from the media
center team who is just

17
00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.610
showing me some pretty, really
cool stuff, actually running on

18
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.580
his Mac. And we're here
to talk about media center,

19
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.570
specifically the development side. Thanks
for taking the time. Oh,

20
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.560
pleasure to be here, Scott.
So I'm, I'm buying this

21
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.380
house and it's a two
story house and I want

22
00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.020
to do some automation at
a big screen TV. I

23
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.080
got an Xbox three 60,
got the media center upstairs,

24
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.570
got the new windows. I'm
running windows ultimate. A lot

25
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.970
of people buy windows ultimate.
For some reason, they forget

26
00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.980
that media center is sitting
right there. That's why you

27
00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.940
buy ultimate. I want to
be able to write a

28
00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.490
program that I can see
the layout of my house

29
00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.920
on my big screen TV.
I want to integrate it

30
00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.290
in a media center. How
do I, how do I

31
00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:11.240
do that? How do I
do that as a developer?

32
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.800
How do I do that
as a hobbyist? How do

33
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.560
I do that? Well, First
of all, you'd get our

34
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.370
software development kit. That's available
from the web. We'll put

35
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.180
a link in them in
the show notes and basically

36
00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.690
to create a windows media
center application. You need to

37
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.160
have a visual studio express
or notepad. If you really

38
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.550
wanted to get really geeky
on that, you need to

39
00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.310
have a good firm grasp
of XML to use our

40
00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.030
media center, markup language. All
of the visuals are basically

41
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.950
built out of PNGs plus
animations that you add on

42
00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.300
top of those. And then
if you're going to do

43
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.960
a code behind part to
that, you would also need

44
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.480
to use a managed code.
We use most of all

45
00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.370
of the examples that we
ship in the SDK, our

46
00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.390
C sharp, but you could
choose visual basic or whatever.

47
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.320
So those things are kind
of like the basics that

48
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.800
you need to get to
get started. So when you

49
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.310
install the SDK, we'll give
you some IntelliSense for our

50
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.810
media center market language, which
is a declarative based language

51
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.400
that you actually describe the
visuals for your application. Okay?

52
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.430
So just like HTML is
rented by the browser media

53
00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.340
center. Markup language is specific
to media center. This is

54
00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.940
not something that I can
see in my browser when

55
00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.870
I'm doing my debugging. When
I want to go and

56
00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.570
do my edit, refresh, edit,
refresh, what tool am I

57
00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.400
using to see a preview
of what this is going

58
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.800
to look like? So there's
a one tool that ships

59
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.890
in the SDK and it's
called the MCL pre-bill tool.

60
00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.640
It's a short name is
M CML pad, which might

61
00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.800
sound familiar to other technologies
that is really a tool

62
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.400
that's designed for rapid application
development. On the visual side.

63
00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.550
It doesn't have any of
the media center, object model

64
00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.480
or code behind there. It's
really designed for you while

65
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.860
you're working with the XML
and quickly iterating on the

66
00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.840
design of either your page
layout, your individual controls within

67
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.320
that layout and so on
and so forth. Now, is

68
00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.290
there a notion of navigation?
Is it like multiple pages,

69
00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.690
multiple MCL files? Is that
how much of like a

70
00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.760
browser is this? Because I'm
going to be coming at

71
00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.770
this. And I think the
hobbyist would as a, a

72
00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.500
person who could whip out
some HTML and a note

73
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.780
pad, save it and open
it up. So there is

74
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.960
a certain markup render or
market Brender kind of relationship.

75
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.760
Absolutely. Yeah. So there's definitely
the markup and renderer switch

76
00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.450
between. So you'll be writing
your XML and then previewing

77
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.320
it or refreshing it in
the MCL preview tool. We

78
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.730
also ship a launcher experience
as well. That allows you

79
00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:50.010
to have a history. So
you can double click on

80
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.170
a list of files, which
will open it up in

81
00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:54.330
the preview tool and so
on and so forth. So

82
00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.720
it makes it a little
bit nicer that switch or

83
00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.690
being able to maintain multiple
files. Cause you really, you

84
00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.260
really, you don't really have
one big, giant XML file

85
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.010
that would define your user
interface. You would have, you

86
00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.140
know, sub pieces to that.
If you had a button

87
00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.200
in your application, you'd have
a UI that defines the

88
00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.690
look and the feel and
the behaviors of a button,

89
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.720
if you had your bitmap
for your house. Yes. So

90
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.370
let's use that example. So
I've got a house it's

91
00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.950
got two floors. Maybe someone
else might have a house

92
00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.470
was three's name. I want
to use this. I'm making

93
00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.450
one MCL page per floor,
or do I have my,

94
00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:31.380
am I, can I put
the notion of, of, of

95
00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.260
navigation within the single CML
and then move back and

96
00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:39.930
forth between the two floors?
Sure. There's really within CML

97
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.440
or really our page model.
You have multiple pages, so

98
00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.350
you can navigate forward into
pages. You can navigate back

99
00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:50.520
into pages. Those pages are
defined as yet. Another UI

100
00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:54.810
there's really the base level
markup for creating a button

101
00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.130
is the about the same
base level markup for creating

102
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:02.950
a page pages. Just another
type of UI. It's not

103
00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:05.800
a one to one relationship
between Paige and media center

104
00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.670
is a file on the
disc. It can be, but

105
00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:13.330
it doesn't always have to
be. The nice thing about

106
00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:18.310
media center development is you
really have quite a bit

107
00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:22.270
of flexibility for how you
want to build your user

108
00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:26.080
interface. You might have a
page model, for example, one

109
00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.410
of the applications that ships
within the SDK as a

110
00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:32.830
sample application, we call it
Z. It very much has

111
00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:36.280
a page, a drill in
model. So you select an

112
00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:39.730
album which then drills you
into that album details. And

113
00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:42.160
then you can do certain
things with that particular page

114
00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.640
and then you back out.
But we also there's other

115
00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:50.530
application models that you could
also choose for like your

116
00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:54.370
floors. You might have all
your floors represented in one

117
00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:57.820
horizontal plane and as you
move left and right, or

118
00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:02.290
up and down, those floors
move up and down or

119
00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:05.500
left and right, as you
so desire, you don't need

120
00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.860
to drill into a different
page per floor. It's that

121
00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:12.640
floor comes in as expected.
So when I, when I

122
00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.710
first heard about this and
I'm sure people on the,

123
00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:16.630
on the, who are listening
are thinking about this as

124
00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:19.120
well, I was like, Oh
no, yet another markup language

125
00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:23.950
couldn't we have done this
in HTML and JavaScript or

126
00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:26.350
SVG or any number of
different angle bracket things. Now

127
00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:30.580
it wasn't some original development
in, in media center done

128
00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:33.940
in HTML Java. Okay. So
our very first platform which

129
00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:39.580
shipped around the year 2003,
the first platform was designed

130
00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:42.730
around a hosted HTML model.
So you use the same

131
00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:47.140
JavaScript, HTML. You could even
use flash inside of that

132
00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:51.490
model. And it was really
just to get people thinking

133
00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:54.760
its original design was to
get people thinking about building

134
00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:59.590
applications that would be remote
controlled. However, there's a certain

135
00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:03.250
fidelity that we ultimately wanted
these applications to be able

136
00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:08.230
to have. And HTML is
you're familiar with can only

137
00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:11.140
get you so far as
far as the fidelity of

138
00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:14.590
the Right. I remember when
I was doing a media

139
00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:16.870
center, extender stuff, trying to
get my old X-Box to

140
00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:19.630
connect. There was this real
clear transition. When you went

141
00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:22.420
from the media center world
into the, and now we're

142
00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:26.150
rendering HTML and it was,
it was fairly Abrupt, abrupt.

143
00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:29.110
Yeah. Now it seems like
everything in media centers got

144
00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:31.750
transitions and transparencies and stuff
like that. Like earlier you

145
00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:33.970
said P and G's. So
I'm trying to think about

146
00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:36.550
what the minimum amount of
effort one could put into

147
00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:40.480
this. It's like, I need
express, that's free a MCM

148
00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:44.400
Mel pad and the SST
K and that's free. What

149
00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:47.830
paid for Vista already. I
can get paint.net and make

150
00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:51.430
some transparent PNGs. I'm not
seeing any additional financial outlay

151
00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:53.980
on my part, which is
good. Cause the wife acceptance

152
00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:55.590
factor will be very low
if I had to pay

153
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:57.470
for any of this. That
was kind of one of

154
00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:00.170
the goals that we set
out with creating the platform

155
00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:03.680
for media center is really
geared towards hobbyists people that

156
00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.180
don't have a ton of
money, but are interested in

157
00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:10.550
bringing some new experiences to
their windows media center. So

158
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:14.180
we really intentionally kind of
designed this around that. Once

159
00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:17.120
you got windows Vista home
premium or windows Vista, ultimate

160
00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:21.140
the tools that were out
there that are free of

161
00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:24.050
charge would allow you to,
to build this. Now you

162
00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:27.500
can always upgrade the visual
studio and you get, you

163
00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:32.720
know, additional development, help and
efficiencies there, but sure. All

164
00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.880
of our sample applications that
we ship in the SDK

165
00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.340
compile with express. No problem.
No, you just, you just

166
00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:39.320
reminded me. I mean, I'm,
I'm, I'm a fool. I'm

167
00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:43.130
just thinking that media center
comes with premium home premium.

168
00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:45.490
It's like the second, the
second skew and all of

169
00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:48.500
the skews above that have
have media on the, on

170
00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:52.030
the consumer side, the consumer
side Professional business. Sure, sure.

171
00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:57.560
But home premium, ultimate, this
is all stuff that people

172
00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:59.390
have. So I mean like
my wife has home premium,

173
00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:00.800
so she has this on
her laptop. I didn't even

174
00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.590
realize it means she has
a media center. Cool. As

175
00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:05.960
long as she doesn't have
home basic she's she's solid.

176
00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.830
That's correct. Okay. So we're
transitioning then from, you said

177
00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:12.860
like in 2003, using HTML
to, to a new markup

178
00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:14.990
language. So obviously there must
have been a reason to

179
00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:17.270
make a new market language,
as opposed to maybe using

180
00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:18.860
something that was off the
shelf for some of the

181
00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:21.920
other markup language of what,
what is it that specialized

182
00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:25.520
about media center that makes
MCL more appropriate for me

183
00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:27.860
to send her and not
one of the other angle

184
00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:32.180
bracket languages? That's a, that's
a really interesting question. We

185
00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:36.230
talked about the host HTML
model when you used it.

186
00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:39.590
There was a very abrupt
transition between I'm in media

187
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:42.920
center and now I'm in
this other world. It may

188
00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:46.070
work. Okay. But it's a
rather abrupt transition. All of

189
00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:50.150
a sudden I don't have
animations or alpha blendings. It's

190
00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:55.880
it's very snap, snap, snap,
not beautiful UI. So we

191
00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:59.180
looked around at a couple
of options. And the interesting

192
00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:03.650
thing is, is we have
built media center itself in

193
00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:08.030
various flavors of media center,
market language, since its very

194
00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:10.970
beginning. Our UI framework that
we use to build media

195
00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:15.440
center is what we ultimately
said. This works really great.

196
00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:17.990
Why don't we just expose
this for third parties to

197
00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:21.260
build upon? So it was
really a question of we've

198
00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.380
got this pretty good UI
framework that we've been able

199
00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:28.010
to build a pretty compelling
product. Why not just make

200
00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:31.400
that available? So that was
kind of the Genesis of

201
00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:36.230
let's, you know, get something
out there that's better. And

202
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:38.060
there was also a couple
of other wins in that

203
00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:42.260
space. Number one media center,
market language in the UI

204
00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:45.680
framework, the UI renderer was
built from the ground up

205
00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:50.030
to remote to other devices,
such as the Xbox three

206
00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:52.970
60, where the renderer runs
on the Xbox three 60

207
00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:56.500
and we send the markup
over the wire and let

208
00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:59.230
it be native Lee rendered
on the Xbox three 60.

209
00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:02.950
So being able to remote
the UI was very important

210
00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:07.420
for both our experience and
third party experiences. In addition,

211
00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:10.630
it was built from the
ground up to work with

212
00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:14.200
the remote control. So in
any piece of UI that

213
00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.330
you build, if you want
it to work with the

214
00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:20.980
remote control, you add basically
one line in the XML

215
00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:24.640
that says this thing can
take key focus and we

216
00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:28.390
manage all of the what's
it sisters and it's siblings

217
00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:32.500
and it's parent and it's
children objects and manage that

218
00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:35.020
focus of that object for
you. You don't have to

219
00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:38.410
create a focus manager and
figure out I'm here. So

220
00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:40.090
I need to move, right?
So I'm going to this

221
00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:45.220
object that just kind of
works automagically for you. So

222
00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:47.650
the remoting of the experiences
and the fact that these

223
00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:49.810
can just work out of
the box with very little

224
00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:55.060
code whatsoever in the markup
with the remote control, where

225
00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:58.180
the two big things that
really drove us to make

226
00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:00.780
this available, You just brought
something up is very interesting.

227
00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:02.700
A lot of people I've
heard just to kind of

228
00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:05.640
like in the hallways, not
the hallways of Microsoft, but

229
00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:08.160
out there, the geeks talking
to the geeks, myself included,

230
00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:11.400
I always assumed it was
remote desktop. That would be,

231
00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:13.500
Oh yeah. Well, you know,
the Xbox remote desktops over

232
00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:15.210
to the media center is
just one of those things

233
00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:18.570
that kids at Fry's say.
Yeah, but that's not RDP.

234
00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:25.920
So for hosted HTML experiences,
yes, it's a terminal server

235
00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:31.260
slash RDP. We're sending over
a whole sales screenshots, you

236
00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:35.340
know, three to five frames
per second. That continues to

237
00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:38.130
be the case for third
party applications built on the

238
00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:42.180
hosted HTML model because there's
really not a remoting strategy

239
00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:46.350
or story around HTML. However,
if you use media center,

240
00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:49.860
markup language, you get the
full fidelity remoting where essentially,

241
00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:52.770
you know, this is Like,
there wouldn't have been a

242
00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:55.650
remoting strategy around HTML unless
I built an entire browser

243
00:13:55.650 --> 00:13:59.460
framework on the, on the
Xbox. Right. Right. So then

244
00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:04.080
even then HTML doesn't have
the concept of key frame

245
00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:07.680
animations. They just, it's not
even present in the language.

246
00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:10.500
You always have to add
something else to the mix

247
00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:13.470
that would also right. And
video video. You showed me

248
00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:16.230
a demo earlier with some
videos spinning around and overlaid

249
00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:19.170
and alpha blended all kind
of simultaneously, if that was

250
00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:21.480
running on an Xbox, that
would just, it would just

251
00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:24.030
run. Cause it's all rendered.
It's all rendered locally on

252
00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:26.310
the Xbox. It would have
the same look, the same

253
00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:29.700
feel. There's no difference. The
sample that I showed you,

254
00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:33.870
we happen to have locally
installed, but that markup could

255
00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:36.600
be delivered from the web.
It would render with the

256
00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:39.270
same fidelity. So To make
some animations, I just got

257
00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:40.830
this idea. I'm thinking if
I have all this power

258
00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:42.330
on the client side, I
can do some crazy stuff

259
00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:44.490
with it. Let's say I've
got my two PNGs of

260
00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:46.200
the top floor of the
house and the bottom floor

261
00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:48.990
of the house. I want
it to look flat. Like

262
00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:50.610
I've got them stacked on
top of each other, you

263
00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:53.510
know like 3d. Yup, yup.
Move up and down between

264
00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:56.270
them. So they'll basically bend
up against the screen and

265
00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:59.500
then go back down again.
Totally doable. Totally doable. But

266
00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:01.150
we have to do this
now. The what a great

267
00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:03.790
sample. The neat thing about
that. I can do that

268
00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:05.980
now. I work here. Yes.
You could do that until

269
00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:08.290
I released that. You could
totally release that. But the

270
00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:10.240
nice thing is you could
have done this, you know,

271
00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:12.670
when we released windows Vista,
because this is all public

272
00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:17.740
platform. So what you've described
that, that transition that animation

273
00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:19.450
is What you're telling me
is that this is not

274
00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:22.840
news that I'm like totally
getting amped about MCL. And

275
00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:24.820
it's like a year and
a half old. I think

276
00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:27.430
it's, I think it's well
it's well, let's see. We,

277
00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:33.760
we publicize the availability of
MCL in mid 2006. So

278
00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:36.490
we're, it's been out there,
but I think it's largely

279
00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:40.060
one of those sleeper technologies
that if you're a windows

280
00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:43.420
media center enthusiast and you're
a developer and you've got

281
00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:45.310
an idea to build a
product and you went and

282
00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:48.150
did a search for what
I need, you would find

283
00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:52.480
as thing you would find
media center, markup language or

284
00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:55.930
our platform. But outside of
that, and we're, we're actually

285
00:15:55.930 --> 00:15:58.300
okay with that, not being
broadly known and it just

286
00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:00.910
grows from a grassroots level.
I will be sure not

287
00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:03.670
to give this podcast to
anyone. I won't be telling

288
00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:06.580
anyone. You can give this
five guests Thinking about all

289
00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:08.590
the 10 because this idea
of 10 foot, right. I

290
00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:11.140
mean, I've got the little
media center keyboard deal. Right,

291
00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:12.880
right, right. I'm not sure
quite how to get some

292
00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:14.470
of this stuff to work
with the Xbox. There's some

293
00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:17.620
trick with the wireless keyboard,
getting the Xbox to respect

294
00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:19.270
the keys. I can do
the arrows, but I can't

295
00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:23.890
do the typing. So generally
speaking, you want your applications

296
00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:29.470
because they're really designed to
be remote controlled usage. You

297
00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:32.140
want to make sure that
your applications only work or

298
00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:34.690
can work just fine with
just up down left. Right?

299
00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:38.530
Okay. And the back button
Onscreen keyboard that's available as

300
00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:41.950
a service or We ship
a onscreen keyboard example in

301
00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:44.440
the Z sample application that
if you need the onscreen

302
00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:48.820
keyboard or text entry functionality
with remote control, you call

303
00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:50.890
leverage the Z sample app.
Just got the idea for

304
00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:52.930
like three things. I want
to make the, the one

305
00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:55.330
with the, the layout of
the house. I can turn

306
00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:57.910
the lights on and off
because I can't be bothered

307
00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:59.890
to get up and walk
across the room. Of course

308
00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:02.230
not. And then I want
to do 10 foot banking,

309
00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:03.820
right? I want to be
able to check my balances

310
00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:06.700
and stuff while watching a
show. Now, can I do

311
00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:09.070
that? Can I be watching
a show and put it

312
00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:11.920
in the corner and do
my banking? You could put

313
00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:13.840
it in the corner or
you could leave the show

314
00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:17.980
up full screen and overlay
your UI alpha blended on

315
00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:20.530
top of the show. It's
a great way to maximize

316
00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:23.170
your time. If, if you're
not into watching commercials, you

317
00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:25.270
can check your bank balance
while you're watching the commercials.

318
00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:28.180
But the show is running
in the background. You've seen

319
00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:30.460
the how media center. If
you bring up the start

320
00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:32.830
menu after you've got full
screen video, we just overlay

321
00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:34.960
the start menu on top
of the full screen video.

322
00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:37.510
So that's totally possible. And
this isn't an MCL question,

323
00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:39.940
but what about like alerts
and stuff? What about does

324
00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:42.130
the caller ID stuff? And
I want to, let's say

325
00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:43.690
that, let's say I want
to build an application where

326
00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:45.940
somebody pushes a button on
the doorbell and I have

327
00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:47.740
a, I have a camera
that's in front of my

328
00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:50.370
house and I want a
popup to happen while I'm

329
00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:52.620
watching my show that someone's
at the front door and

330
00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:54.210
I click it. And then
I see the video of

331
00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:57.290
that guy. How would I
do that? It's totally possible.

332
00:17:57.290 --> 00:18:01.100
The nice thing about when
does the media center presentation

333
00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:04.790
layer applications, as you have
the full power of the.net

334
00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:09.380
framework behind those for coded
applications. So pretty much anything

335
00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:13.130
you can do from an
alert standpoint, you can do

336
00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:16.250
using a manager code and
inter-op that you can get

337
00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:19.250
all of those things. So
if the Xbox has a

338
00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:23.030
renderer, but the Xbox doesn't
have the.net framework. So where's

339
00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:24.860
that code still running on
the server and just the

340
00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:27.170
rendering is heading to, yeah,
That is correct. So the

341
00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:31.280
application is still running in
the context on the PC,

342
00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:36.620
the visuals, what you see,
the visuals are running natively

343
00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:39.650
on the Xbox, which actually
provides you with a very

344
00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:43.610
nice abstraction layer. You don't
have to write it a

345
00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:46.340
different way for current on
the Xbox. You write it

346
00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:49.100
one way and it just
runs fine on the edge.

347
00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:51.320
And because I installed it
locally and I'm kind of

348
00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:54.110
extrapolating, I'm guessing here, but
because I started locally, I

349
00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:56.330
there's no cross site scripting.
We're talking about.net so I

350
00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:59.180
can call out to whatever
domain I want and make

351
00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:02.360
retrieve data. Yeah. There's two
different types of applications that

352
00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:04.640
you can build with this
technology. One is a locally

353
00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:08.120
installed application with full rights.
However you want to get

354
00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:11.060
it. Now, of course we
recommend you don't require people

355
00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:13.910
launch media center with administrator
privileges. That's just not a

356
00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:17.840
good thing. In general speaking,
you don't want to do

357
00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:20.600
that, but pretty much you
have full access to local

358
00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:24.710
machining can do all kinds
of things. The other type

359
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:28.310
of application that you can
create is think about a

360
00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:32.600
dos blog, for example, today
at outputs HTML, where you

361
00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:35.900
could change DAS blog or
add some stuff so that

362
00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:39.860
it would output M CML
instead, and it would render

363
00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:44.870
full fidelity on media center
or the Mentally designed this.

364
00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:48.050
Now I know it's always
scary when, when I tell

365
00:19:48.050 --> 00:19:50.810
people this, so we've kind
of really taken that's the

366
00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:54.410
web model. So basically there's
no local code. You have

367
00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:58.250
full access to the media
center API. So you can

368
00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:01.370
play back media. You can
turn the volume up or

369
00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:05.360
down. You could get to
Meda data for the currently

370
00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:09.590
playing song. For example, you
have full access to the

371
00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:14.030
media center API as well
as a white list of.net

372
00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:18.440
framework types in the web
model. So we sometimes refer

373
00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:20.420
to this as the codeless
model because you don't have

374
00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:24.050
to push code down to
the local machine whatsoever. You're

375
00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:26.240
somewhat limited in the fact
that you can't get access

376
00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:28.940
to everything in the.net framework,
but I think we've done

377
00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:32.060
a relatively good job with
this version of the sandbox.

378
00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:34.850
It's a, it's very, it's
not even really a sandbox

379
00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:37.520
it's, we're rendering the MCL
that you pushed down to

380
00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:40.550
us and we're giving you
access to our object. Okay?

381
00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:43.730
So there's, there's no browser
though on the Xbox, no

382
00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:46.340
browser. And so how do
I, let's say, let's say

383
00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:48.130
I want to make a
Hanselman com where someone hits

384
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:50.650
hanselman.com and they're gonna get
MCL. How do I get

385
00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:55.390
my icon into the programs
it's called more programs or

386
00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:59.600
online services section of the
There's the program library library.

387
00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:03.720
There's a whole registration API.
You would have to get

388
00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:07.830
somebody to actually install the
link for your application. Cause

389
00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:10.650
it's not a random browser.
You can't just type www

390
00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:12.270
whatever and go to it.
Okay. Talk to me about

391
00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:15.000
that experience. They log in
locally on their immediate center,

392
00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:18.300
they launched their browser cause
they're locally. They download what

393
00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:22.080
In, in particular case, what
we we tend to recommend

394
00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:25.950
is people have a very
small installer that would just

395
00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:29.070
do the registration of the
application. And basically what that's

396
00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:33.360
doing is registering the web
Adyen that we have built

397
00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:36.000
in the media center that
serves as the host framework

398
00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:39.450
for the web model. And
they're pre supplying it with

399
00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:42.720
a URL for an entry
point for a landing page.

400
00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:45.240
So that when I select
that item in media center,

401
00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:48.540
it launches up the web
add in which provides the

402
00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:51.990
object model to the web
applications and then navigates to

403
00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:55.200
the URL that you have
supplied that. So we use,

404
00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:56.940
there is a little bit,
there's not a, you know,

405
00:21:56.970 --> 00:22:01.020
click through or a browser
gallery, such as that today,

406
00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:03.450
you still have to do
some, some the users has

407
00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:06.270
to do some amount of
work to get that Because

408
00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:08.670
it's a security, there's a
security issue there, right? You

409
00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:11.760
can't just have them willingly
bringing stuff onto their machine

410
00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:13.830
and then running inside of
their media center. It's not

411
00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:17.790
a browser. It's not the
wild wild West. From that

412
00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:20.370
standpoint, When he goes to
my website, they download my

413
00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:22.830
MSI, very small one. I
put down a couple of

414
00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:26.320
just text files really in,
in, in wherever program files,

415
00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:30.450
<inaudible> got an XML file
that describes the application, what

416
00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:33.000
the URL is and so
on and so forth. You

417
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.300
would have a PNG file,
a graphics file that serves

418
00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:40.770
as the image that the
visual representation media center, those

419
00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:44.050
are basically the two things
that you need. And then

420
00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:47.640
that, that MSI would call
the registration API. It would

421
00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:51.780
create that shortcut in media
center, the user would launch

422
00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:54.270
that in media center and
then they're just hitting a

423
00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:56.550
web server at that point.
And I'm just pushing different

424
00:22:56.550 --> 00:22:58.410
markups. So I could use
the setup with DAS blog.

425
00:22:58.410 --> 00:23:00.360
I could use the same
blog post. I just need

426
00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:02.310
to build in like the,
I could have people comment.

427
00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:04.290
I could use the onscreen
keyboard and they could comment

428
00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:06.960
and blah totally possible, totally
possible. I assume there's RSS

429
00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:10.080
reader, applications, people live. We
actually have built the Q

430
00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:17.010
sample application, which is an
RSS uses the windows RSS

431
00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:20.760
feed store to store it.
So you can basically pass

432
00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:22.410
it into a PML file
and it gives you a

433
00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:27.810
pretty radical gratuitous animation, a
DNA helix look and feel

434
00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:30.780
cool. It's kind of gratuitous,
but it works fine. Like

435
00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:33.960
I've got high insulin minutes
subscribed to mine. It picks

436
00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:36.420
up the picture and does
all those interests Singing neat.

437
00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:38.160
So if I have a
feed, a feed reader on

438
00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:41.340
that system, like feed Damon,
that sinks to the RSS

439
00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:43.560
feed store, those feeds are
still gonna, they're going to

440
00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:45.710
be in the same place.
It's the same storage, correct?

441
00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:48.110
The Q Sample application will
work fine with you. Again,

442
00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:51.470
we kind of, we created
it for mics in Oh

443
00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:54.080
six and we kind of
wanted to just have something

444
00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:56.330
flashy. So the UI is
really good to have this.

445
00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:59.500
It's kind of cute. It's
neat. It's not as, Oh,

446
00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:01.780
they're right though. I can
completely and take a little

447
00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:03.970
bit of stuff. So what
other samples are like pretty

448
00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:07.570
awesome. The Q and the
Z sample applications are what

449
00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:09.700
we ship out of the
box. They're really designed to

450
00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:15.370
show best practices, animations. There's
also the MCMs sampler, which

451
00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:19.930
ships with the software development
kit. And it's about 125

452
00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:23.530
different examples of how to
do different things. Excuse me,

453
00:24:23.530 --> 00:24:28.480
125, 125 different samples of
M CML files that show

454
00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:31.090
you how to do data
binding, how to do property

455
00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:34.060
change events and things like
that. Talk to me about

456
00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:37.060
that because an applicate, like
in my example of the

457
00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:39.700
running around in my house
and turning lights on and

458
00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:42.460
off, that's going to be
pretty static and all the

459
00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:43.990
pictures of the pictures. But
if I'm going to pull

460
00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:46.180
data in, where might I
pull it in from, from

461
00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:49.480
web services, It's really up
to you from where you

462
00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:53.200
want to pull your data
in the UI framework, layer

463
00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:55.810
media. So our markup language
is kind of agnostic. It

464
00:24:55.810 --> 00:24:58.930
doesn't really care where that
data comes from. As long

465
00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:03.160
as it's bound in the
CML, it's abstracted in such

466
00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:05.350
a way that we don't
really have to tell it

467
00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:07.900
specifically where to get it.
I'm familiar with binding to

468
00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:10.270
data grids and I'm familiar
with binding and wind forms.

469
00:25:10.270 --> 00:25:11.890
You know, it's just going
to be familiar in this

470
00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:15.220
kind of sense. Some pieces
will be familiar. Some pieces

471
00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:19.420
will not. It's a, it's
a pretty radical shift. If

472
00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:22.510
you're used to doing wind
forms of data grid and

473
00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:25.650
having a property sheet that
you can go in and

474
00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:28.810
hook up. And then visual
studio kind of takes care

475
00:25:28.810 --> 00:25:31.060
of all the plumbing for
you. You really, when you're

476
00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:33.280
working with media, so our
market language have to know

477
00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:37.120
how to do that plumbing
yourself, but the key thing

478
00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:39.820
there to remember about media.
So our market language is

479
00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:46.150
it's really designed for just
the UI visuals. If you

480
00:25:46.150 --> 00:25:48.490
had done that before to
do all the rest and.net

481
00:25:48.490 --> 00:25:52.270
is there to do the
logic and the data from

482
00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:54.940
that standpoint. So once you
wire it up, once you've

483
00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:57.730
created that binding, for example,
let's say you have a

484
00:25:57.730 --> 00:26:01.150
list. We saw an example
of, there were four buttons

485
00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:03.820
in that, in that page,
right? And they said, alpha

486
00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:06.040
beta Charlie Delta, right? And
you're treating them as a

487
00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:07.720
list box, but they're four
buttons. Cause we're talking about

488
00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:13.120
a remote experience, Basically a
UI, which has a look

489
00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:15.940
and feel and behavior, No,
you keep saying UI and

490
00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:17.770
you keep kind of leaning
forward in your chair, which

491
00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:20.230
means that I'm guessing UI
is probably an element in

492
00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:23.140
the XML angle bracket UI.
Cause you're not just meaning

493
00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:28.030
user interface. It's a fundamental
building block AUI. This is

494
00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:30.220
an element in MCL that
I would see in a

495
00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:33.040
UI is any UI element
that can possibly receive focus

496
00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:35.980
or be involved in some
activity, Correct? Correct. It's, it's

497
00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:39.880
really a fundamental building block
for any type of UI.

498
00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:42.550
That UI might be a
page layout that UI might

499
00:26:42.550 --> 00:26:45.480
be an album cover representation.
That UI might be a

500
00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:48.320
button For me. Let's say,
I'm going to put this,

501
00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:53.000
this house diagram together is
the diagram of like the

502
00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.370
bottom floor. That's a UI.
But if I want to

503
00:26:55.370 --> 00:26:58.370
hover over, I want to
move the, the remote control

504
00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:02.000
to select the bedroom or
select a bathroom. And I

505
00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.570
want to have that highlight
in a shape that overlays

506
00:27:05.570 --> 00:27:08.630
the same as the, is
that a UI? Yeah. There's

507
00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:10.400
a couple of different ways
you could approach that problem.

508
00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:12.200
We'd have to get into
the design of the wire

509
00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:14.270
frames and really kind of
understand how we're going to

510
00:27:14.270 --> 00:27:17.120
lay out this, this experience.
You get the general, but

511
00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:21.380
the UIs can contain other
nested UIs. So you might

512
00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:25.970
have your, your, your floor
plan, right? Your top level

513
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.600
UI in which each of
your bedrooms or rooms in

514
00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:33.830
your house are sub UIs
that have characteristics. Now a

515
00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:37.520
UI is definitely have the
concept of properties, which you

516
00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:40.640
can use the same UI
in multiple places. You just

517
00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:44.300
push different values to it
as it's instantiated. I see.

518
00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:48.530
So it's very rich, very
deep. Cool. All right. So

519
00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:50.510
when people search for this,
I think go looking for

520
00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:53.510
the, they search for the
media center. SDK, is there

521
00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:56.750
a specific version number that
we're looking for? So there's

522
00:27:56.930 --> 00:27:59.840
the current one is version
5.2, the best way to

523
00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:02.810
always get the latest, greatest
bits for that is to

524
00:28:02.810 --> 00:28:07.640
go to media center, sandbox.com.
Okay. And that that's, that's

525
00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:10.190
our team blog. And we
always keep the links for

526
00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:12.590
both the online version of
the SDK, which is just

527
00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:16.040
MSDN documentation, as well as
the installable version, which has

528
00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:19.040
all the sample code and
the tools. We always keep

529
00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:22.190
the links to the most
recent versions of those on

530
00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:24.920
that, on that page. I
already got like, you know,

531
00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:28.460
I can use this in
2005 or orcas Right now.

532
00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:32.690
We just released through Aaron
Stegner's blog. We released some

533
00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:36.590
templates for orcas, orcas, still
beta products. We tend to

534
00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:39.200
not sure, But let's say
that I've got 2005 express.

535
00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:41.480
I've still got that installed
works great. And I go

536
00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:43.640
file new. And there's going
to be media center options,

537
00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:46.550
A media center application that
we just released with the

538
00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:50.210
5.2, which basically there's three
steps. You do, you have

539
00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:55.010
to strong name, sign the
application, copy of that strong

540
00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:58.160
name, key into the registration.
And you're done. You have

541
00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:00.740
basically the, the application that
we saw earlier with the

542
00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:03.710
four buttons, okay. Gives you
that application. And I'm a

543
00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:07.130
developer who's, you know, maybe
I'm From listening to this

544
00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:09.440
podcast and probably a developer.
I don't want to mess

545
00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:12.080
up my machine. This isn't
gagging a whole bunch of

546
00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:14.510
stuff. Or, I mean, is
this going to harm my

547
00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:15.770
machine from the point of
view of it's not going

548
00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:17.390
to affect my day to
day development, right? We're adding

549
00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:21.080
some templates. Are we adding
any add ins? We are,

550
00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:24.320
we have the MCL pad
that we talked about as

551
00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:27.380
well as the MCMs sampler,
those run as media center

552
00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:31.370
applications. So they are installed
in the media center and

553
00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:35.510
they are launched from there.
I, I personally have installed

554
00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:38.390
lots of versions of our
SDK and it's beta incarnations

555
00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:41.500
and they've done the stalls
cleanly. Cool. Just lays a

556
00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:43.300
couple files down because you
know, people always worry about

557
00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:44.830
that. It's is going gonna,
is it going to change

558
00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:47.650
my day to day and
development environment? I don't think

559
00:29:47.650 --> 00:29:51.070
so. I mean, I use
it, I install RSDK all

560
00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:54.130
the time on my main
computers, both here at work

561
00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:56.710
and at home and never
have any problems. I mean,

562
00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:59.350
it's, it's a development platform.
So you have to kind

563
00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:01.270
of integrate like all the
other kinds of add ins

564
00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:04.780
that you would put into
visual studio, correct? Correct. So

565
00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:07.690
all the experiences that you
see that ship out of

566
00:30:07.690 --> 00:30:10.900
the box with visual studio
or visual C sharp express

567
00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:13.630
edition, all of those application
templates are still there. We

568
00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:16.120
just add a couple to
them and like, I'm starting

569
00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:17.740
to get distracted because I'm
trying to figure out how

570
00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:20.410
I'm going to do this
because I'm already, I'm already

571
00:30:20.410 --> 00:30:22.240
to go. And like, I
gotta call my wife and

572
00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:25.600
have her send me the
JPEGs at the plans for

573
00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:28.390
the house. So when I
go file new last question,

574
00:30:28.390 --> 00:30:31.060
I go file new in
is our new projects and

575
00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:33.340
new items or what different
things are at. There's a

576
00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:35.530
new project that you can
select that kind of builds

577
00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:39.010
you out of the basic
level, hello world application that

578
00:30:39.010 --> 00:30:43.810
you can then build upon.
We also include an MCL

579
00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:47.080
file template. So you can
add a new MCL file.

580
00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:50.740
It will have the basics
of the properties, the locals,

581
00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:55.390
the rules and the content.
Cool. Well, Charlie, I really

582
00:30:55.390 --> 00:30:57.880
appreciate you taking the time.
This is a fun first

583
00:30:58.390 --> 00:31:00.670
Microsoft insiders kind of view.
I didn't, I didn't know

584
00:31:00.670 --> 00:31:02.470
that any of this stuff
existed well, now you do.

585
00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:03.850
And now I do, and
I'm going to go and

586
00:31:03.850 --> 00:31:06.070
figure out how to build
these things. And Papale, since

587
00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:07.780
I worked for Microsoft, I
can now email you to

588
00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:10.510
help me anytime. Cool. All
right. Thanks a lot. This

589
00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:12.400
has been an episode of
Hanselminutes and we'll see you

590
00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:23.260
next week. <inaudible>.
