00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.180
Hey folks, Intel is a
sponsor this week and I

2
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:07.050
welcome them because they're bringing
some high performance developer tools

3
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.950
for all of us. Check
out Intel's parallel studio X,

4
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.100
E I've talked about parallelism
before on the show and

5
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.700
the importance of using the
complete instruction set, unlocking the

6
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.740
power of the process or
that your code is running

7
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.470
on. Now, you all might
be writing C or C

8
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.980
plus plus Python or even
Fortran, but is your code

9
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.960
building in such a way
and written in such a

10
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.820
way that it uses the
latest techniques for vectorization multithreading

11
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.490
multi-node parallelization or memory optimization?
Intel parallel studio ECC has

12
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.950

X E. Hi, this is

18
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.340
Scott Hanselman. This is another
episode of Hansel minutes today.

19
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.250
I'm talking with peanut, which
one? Dardy. He has created

20
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.770
a whole bunch of animations
that you have seen. He's

21
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.350
been in the Tribeca film
festival. He's an award winning

22
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.970
shorty awards, nominated all over.
You've seen his stuff. Thank

23
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.270
you so much for coming
on my show. Thank you

24
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.320
so much for having me.
So you are a designer

25
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.450
and you work at Vayner
media, or do they, have

26
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.610
you make these, these, these
small videos or are you

27
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.640
making them in your, in
your spare time? Yeah, I

28
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.410
was I'm at work with
Emilia as nanny methods and

29
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.090
sometimes at home I do
some personal projects to develop

30
00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.760
something interesting, but still based
on my core skill, as

31
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.620
in any matter. And also
I work with my fits

32
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.070
at home, or I've worked
with there. You might get

33
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.490
an asset of the story
in shots. So basically it's

34
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.830
like, yeah, I thought I
saw on your Instagram and

35
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.890
sometimes on your Twitter where
I think it was one

36
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.710
of your children bought a
little car, and then you

37
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.290
decided to, what did you
do with that car? So

38
00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.840
basically the, usually in the
weekend, walking to the free

39
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.630
market in Manhattan and usually
my teammates or my son

40
00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.790
looking for, he already has
a specific item. That's always

41
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.670
a cat industry like the
car, but at this time

42
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.960
he got the little pricey
car. So I asked him,

43
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.620
okay, you kind of have
this car, but you have

44
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.160
to create Something, read it.
So we decide to create

45
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.550
a stop motion rating. So
after that at home, we

46
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.470
prepare everything and he just
wrote the storyboard and give

47
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.110
it to me. And I
just have him in the

48
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.920
technical standpoint to, to, to
create a video. So basically

49
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.930
just like a, a backend
for collaboration. Yeah. Your family

50
00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.830
is your collaboration team. Yeah,
I do. Yeah. They're my,

51
00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:35.760
they're my imagination center. Yeah.
And it's, it's quite sophisticated

52
00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.490
because they look like simple
animations. But if I were

53
00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.310
trying to make this with
my, maybe with my iPhone,

54
00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.430
I think I would have
trouble. You have like motion.

55
00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:46.980
What is the, what is
it called when the camera

56
00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.730
moves on a specific Track?
Yeah, it's a, I used

57
00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.990
like the most in control
combat rate. I can control

58
00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.980
the combat with my computer,
with the software called Dragonframe.

59
00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.570
The combat will move frame
by frame. I already designed

60
00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.140
in the specific key frame
from a to B with

61
00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.540
the Canberra movement. So it
just want to make the,

62
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.520
the video itself more expanse,
even though it's very simple,

63
00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:21.750
but I try to create
more like a more sophisticated

64
00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.730
or more advance under sure
thing. Yeah. It seems like

65
00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.480
your style is very interesting
because it's easy. I'm going

66
00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.790
to say as someone who
is not an artist anymore,

67
00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.440
I look at it and
I go, Oh wow, it's

68
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.610
very simple, but it's also
so complex. It's both simple

69
00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.200
and complex at the same
time. Yeah. It's, it's like

70
00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.080
a learning by doing my,
my, my kids learn how

71
00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.220
to do, create a video
at the same time. I

72
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.640
learn how to develop an,
a, how to create a

73
00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:58.830
story more spontaneously and more
impulsive and more, you know,

74
00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.070
it's more fluid because basically
as a professional, I work

75
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:06.840
with Charlotte storyboards, timeframe and
schedule and such, but working

76
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.450
with them, it's just like,
there's so many possibilities that

77
00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:16.290
I have to offer basically.
So yeah. One of the

78
00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:18.150
things that you've done lately,
and I think that you're

79
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.680
becoming known for is using
older technology and combining it

80
00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.760
with new techniques to make
something that looks really hard.

81
00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.040
Like even just a few
days ago, you were doing

82
00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:35.280
drawings on original Palm pilot.
Yeah. Recently I'm doing a

83
00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.750
small journey going back to
the old technology when it

84
00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:45.840
was developed or released, but
at a time that products

85
00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.830
or that, that, that technology
was built into something else.

86
00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.190
Like the company that basically
is more like pork business

87
00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:57.710
and Palm PDA is small
business, but they're software and

88
00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:02.870
the capability, it's more, it's
smarter. It's more than that.

89
00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.840
I mean, there are so
many possibilities that we can

90
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:10.670
create, like the enemy's in
itself because maybe not maybe,

91
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:17.900
but I'm sure that when
Candace was released in 1984,

92
00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:22.160
basically for watermark business, our
small business, our home computer

93
00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:28.070
business. But when they trying
to create some art or

94
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:31.640
any missions, they already have
something in mind. It has

95
00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:36.080
to be what are realistic.
It has to be more

96
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:42.990
rich color or Model must
smooth. So when, when, when

97
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:50.020
<inaudible>, they, they're not thinking
very deeply with, with the

98
00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.710
current capability. So when they
are taking any mission, they

99
00:06:53.710 --> 00:07:01.030
will think about big machine,
fancy machine, expensive equipment, basically

100
00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:04.780
in like in the Hollywood
for Hong Kong, with their basically

101
00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.200
you can create an emission
ashram as we can think

102
00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:12.430
at, well, this is what
it is. I mean, it

103
00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:16.180
doesn't have to be with
color. It doesn't have to

104
00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:19.510
be photorealistic, but basically you
can create, say with the

105
00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:24.190
PDA, the Pompidou was built
for businessman, but there's a

106
00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:29.350
animation software. It's very basic.
It's very, it just, it's

107
00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:34.090
like a, not a serious
application. But if we are

108
00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:38.470
looking back with, are already,
we are living in the

109
00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:43.840
era when pixel art become
something. So when we've traveled

110
00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:48.280
back in, in the time
when the pumpy there was

111
00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:55.270
arrived, it's already an art,
it's already something. But when

112
00:07:55.270 --> 00:08:01.240
in the 2000 something fixture
art didn't exist before. So

113
00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:04.780
it's just like a principle
of design, this principle of

114
00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:09.760
art, because at the time
there's no sustaining any mission

115
00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:14.530
done on the farm. I
mean, serious animation, but he's

116
00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:17.950
scared of Mars. This is
Mark with the pixel art

117
00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:21.850
concept with a new concept.
More than that, when we

118
00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:26.170
traveled back with your and
delegates, it's already there. So

119
00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:30.040
basically it's like the mocking
costs and the pumpy, they're

120
00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:34.780
basically like a picture of
art machine. That's true. The

121
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:37.480
black and white is only
one 60 by one 60

122
00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:41.860
black and white, Or maybe
four, four gray. Exactly. It's

123
00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:46.540
already, I mean, because we
already have some principles about

124
00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:51.070
picture are the best. It's
the simplicity of the design

125
00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:56.760
itself. The graphic itself is
already done years ago with

126
00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:00.690
all technology. I have. This
makes sense because I'm still

127
00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:06.950
trying to make or what
that make more sense. Yeah,

128
00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:09.890
I understand. So one of
the things that you've done

129
00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:12.080
that has gone viral, and
of course you've had many

130
00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:15.230
things go viral. You had
a really interesting star Wars

131
00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:19.100
trailer, remake that you made
on an Apple to see

132
00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:24.290
that device was created 20,
30 years ago, 36 years

133
00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:26.510
ago, 34 years ago, a
long time ago. You did

134
00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:30.890
that with a koala pad.
Are you trying to make

135
00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:35.420
it hard on yourself? It's
basically redoing what I did

136
00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:41.180
years ago when I really
wanted an Apple computer, whether

137
00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:43.700
it's Apple to see our
Apple to automatic invest. But

138
00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:47.420
at the time it was
very pricey and we cannot,

139
00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:52.130
we couldn't afford it. So
when I saw someone or

140
00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:56.180
my friends or my family
doing something with their Apple

141
00:09:56.180 --> 00:10:00.560
to see where the color
path I was thinking, why

142
00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:03.110
don't we just create something
like a, we making a

143
00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:07.460
trailer at the time, star
Wars written off with the

144
00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:11.300
diversity. So I was thinking,
can I do something with

145
00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:15.830
it, like a recreating the
trailer for the star Wars?

146
00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:18.800
And of course the Olander
is have, that's not possible.

147
00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:22.190
You will need lots of
these cats. You will need

148
00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:27.110
lots of color because it's
only green. Right? So, but,

149
00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:36.920
but something, I, something bugging
me that, but the company

150
00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:41.270
that is only possible to
do that, why don't people

151
00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:44.150
do the same? I mean,
thought the same, that it's

152
00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:49.310
possible. So when, and now
in the modern times, I

153
00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:54.050
just going back and doing
some, I, I want to

154
00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:57.440
prove something what I said
30 years ago, that it's

155
00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:02.300
possible. So, yeah. And I
think it's, I think it

156
00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:06.260
works. It's possible with the
same equipment, with the same

157
00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:10.280
technology, with the same software
the same. So, so basically

158
00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:13.760
I just want to prove
something here. Not trying too

159
00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:17.290
hard on me, but basically
just want to say something.

160
00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:21.680
Look, I said it was
possible what, 30 years ago,

161
00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:25.700
but basically just like doing,
they're doing what, what I

162
00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:30.260
want to do 30 years
ago. And in the last

163
00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:34.370
few, a few months you've
been working on a series

164
00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:38.960
of pink pixel art sequences
and animations of Donald Glover's

165
00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:41.990
video of his motions from
the video. This is America.

166
00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:45.200
And you make these with,
with what software you're using

167
00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:49.760
a Macintosh one 28 K
Yes. I'm using Mac paint

168
00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:54.490
and a macro media, sorry.
Macro mind video works. The

169
00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:56.710
software was released at the
same time if the same

170
00:11:56.740 --> 00:12:02.710
era. So basically it's a
1985. I believe it's the

171
00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:04.870
same, what I did with
the Apple to see. I

172
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:07.960
just, I just want to
prove something that it was

173
00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:12.630
possible at that time. It
was possible to create an

174
00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:19.330
animation. It was possible as
long as we using the

175
00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:25.600
technology with its own capability,
without expecting too much expanding

176
00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:28.630
collar, expecting a smooth emptiness
and just leave it as

177
00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:31.300
it is with same concept
on a big scale arc

178
00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:34.450
we have today. So I
think back going back to

179
00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:40.170
the old technology to say
that it's possible, Did you

180
00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:42.510
know it was possible? What
would you do if you

181
00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:46.260
started this project and discovered
halfway that it wasn't possible

182
00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:52.800
In 1988, I experienced the
same looking at my friends

183
00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:56.760
doing the same. <inaudible> S
E I was asking the

184
00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:00.360
same. Can I build an
innocence with it? Yeah, that's

185
00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:05.070
possible. But there's a limitation
color limitation with the smoothness

186
00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:09.300
of the animation frame per
second, and some, any high

187
00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:13.470
expectation for the art. And
I just want to do

188
00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:17.340
a simple thing this very
best black and white, and

189
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:20.070
as long as it's moved,
it's any medicine basically. But

190
00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:24.990
again, I didn't get any
chance to, to create something

191
00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:28.050
with the computer. So this
is the same work I

192
00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:31.290
did with a star Wars
ID doing the same situation.

193
00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:34.500
I'm really doing like the
going back to the office

194
00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:38.580
in order to prove it,
that is possible. And it

195
00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:42.570
sounds like you're reliving your
childhood and you're sharing it

196
00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:46.340
with your children. Yeah. You
can say that. So basically

197
00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:49.020
just like a, some delayed
dream that I have to

198
00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:56.580
will feel. And, and, and
now I have another fast

199
00:13:56.820 --> 00:14:00.060
that I can do to
my children that I can

200
00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:04.160
educate them about the technology
history I can show so

201
00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:08.340
they can see about how
the technology was built or

202
00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:12.810
developed in the, in the
years before they born. So

203
00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:16.380
they understand that there is
this gap, there is a

204
00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:20.100
black and white computer there's
limitation and under stories and

205
00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:24.180
such thing. Yeah. I think
that's so important. I actually

206
00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:27.270
spend a lot of time
with my children, teaching them

207
00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:32.370
about retro games, like NES
and super Nintendo. And they

208
00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:35.640
appreciate it. They they've enjoyed
like playing legend of Zelda

209
00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:38.640
and Mario. Okay, good to
know. Yeah. I mean, I

210
00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:42.400
have the same situation, so
it's not just for the

211
00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:48.510
<inaudible> journeys. It's, it's more
like if it has more

212
00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:53.540
deeper, meaning not just nostalgia
because we took it and

213
00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:59.180
experienced the same and then
our children understand about something.

214
00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:02.660
So yeah. I think, I
think, I think we are

215
00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:05.230
doing the same thing here.
Yeah. I think that's really

216
00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:07.780
important. I want to mention
that again for a second,

217
00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:10.660
because you're saying that yes,
there is a wave of

218
00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:14.890
nostalgia. There are people online
who are doing things because

219
00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:18.520
nostalgia I'm old. I wish
I was not old, but

220
00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:22.090
this is really saying, what
if we limit ourselves, how

221
00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:25.840
creative can we be with
the limited tools? And it

222
00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:28.090
makes you say, we could
have done this 30 years

223
00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:31.150
ago. We could use Mac
tablet, Mac, vision, macro mind

224
00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:35.620
director, and done these things.
Yeah. It just like, because

225
00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:41.620
now we have an access
to the <inaudible>. So some

226
00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:46.480
people doing it just for
fun, just for a temporary

227
00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:51.250
pleasure. So I was thinking,
why don't we create something

228
00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:54.730
from it experienced the same
situation with my children, and

229
00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:59.020
maybe it relates into something
new. It relates into something

230
00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:04.450
principles of art or principle
of how to experience the

231
00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:10.900
computer better. Maybe not with
a million color, but you

232
00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:15.820
see there some Minecraft basically
using the same principle. So

233
00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:20.710
basically they're there. So my
kids can, can see the

234
00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:27.910
limitation of technology can lead
into something, something new. So,

235
00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:32.410
so they become independent with
the hierarchy so they can

236
00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:35.980
choose any technology. They want
to create something, whether it's

237
00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:40.600
an art is new, or
maybe back to the traditional,

238
00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:43.870
without computer, like a cell
animation or stop motion. It

239
00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:47.380
just like I'm doing like,
as a parents, giving them

240
00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:51.340
so many options and so
many possibilities and outlandish to

241
00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:56.170
create something, to build something
for the future. Yeah. You

242
00:16:56.170 --> 00:16:58.030
said something about this on
Twitter that I thought was

243
00:16:58.030 --> 00:17:00.310
very special and I'll read
a little bit of here.

244
00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.800
People are asking you, well,
why didn't you just do

245
00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:06.250
this with new technology, it
would be easier, faster, more

246
00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:10.300
efficient. And you said, well,
why do people knit? If

247
00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:12.250
they can print a pattern,
or why do they even

248
00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:14.740
bother sculpting with clay? If
they can use three D

249
00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:17.770
printing or why do they
do an oil painting when

250
00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:21.460
they can paint with Photoshop?
Why? Yeah. It just like

251
00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:25.390
trying to experience the same
pressure with my children. It's

252
00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:29.170
just like, as if, if
I'm collecting an old car

253
00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:32.440
or building an old car
from the scratch, it's like

254
00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:37.780
just trying to ask my
children to come and join

255
00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:41.290
and see how it works,
how it feels. And then

256
00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:44.680
when they start running, the
car can run it just

257
00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:48.220
like we are driving into
the beach and they can

258
00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:51.480
feel the place, the same
presser as if they're just

259
00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:56.040
because in the oldest, the
car itself is the main

260
00:17:56.040 --> 00:18:00.450
purpose is for transportation, but
now it's more than transportation.

261
00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:06.480
It's a nostalgia is an
education device. It's, it's, it's

262
00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:10.800
more than that. It's for
a presser is for giving

263
00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:16.380
to another propose basically via
COVID. Now has a new

264
00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:20.370
purpose, not as for transport,
but more than that for

265
00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:23.400
photography, for a model, for
a prop. So many things

266
00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:26.940
the same way with the
computer. When we are looking

267
00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:30.270
at the call, all computer,
basically, we already thinking that

268
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:35.010
there's no way that I
can create movie. That there's

269
00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:39.030
no way because, because that's
our modern purpose, doesn't fit

270
00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:43.320
with the, with the technology.
But if we modify the

271
00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:46.890
purpose, we still can use
it with another purpose with

272
00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:52.620
another, I dunno, another possibility
in the future. And my,

273
00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:56.880
my, my it's already thought
that he has, he has

274
00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:00.510
some thinking that you should
possible. If we create a

275
00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:06.480
monochrome he made in the
feet are, so this is,

276
00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:10.620
this kind of thought is
it's, it's possible because he

277
00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:16.170
already see the, the monochromatic
one bit display on the

278
00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:20.460
computer and he lives in
Iran. So basically it's like

279
00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:24.900
trying to combine something into
something new, something. That's one

280
00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:28.730
of the example. Yeah. See,
now I hope that the

281
00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:31.850
people who are listening, as
well as myself immediately, I'm

282
00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:36.140
trying to imagine myself in
a VR experiencing one bit

283
00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:39.200
or for, you know, two
bit experience. And what would

284
00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:42.170
that be like? That's a
space now that we have

285
00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:46.850
to explore. Yeah. Somehow it
doesn't make sense for now,

286
00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:52.190
but if the children in
this modern era looking back

287
00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:56.810
and they bring something back
to the modern day nowadays,

288
00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:01.520
and they think of something
for the future, it's like

289
00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:06.710
a interesting combination, you know,
because the kids nowadays usually

290
00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:13.190
doing iPads or the Nintendo's
should get me. So basically

291
00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:16.340
it just like it's already
gap. It's only, it's not

292
00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:21.830
really Tyler or, or bill
into a modern purpose, but

293
00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:26.210
if they are going back
with the new, not new

294
00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:30.830
with the old experience, they
may lead into something new

295
00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:34.340
that, like, that's what I
said about the assemble of

296
00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:36.470
how my kids want to
build the VR based on

297
00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:41.600
the model or monochromatic one
big picture. Basically, it doesn't

298
00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:44.630
make sense for now, but
we don't know in the

299
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:48.850
future in the 10 years,
yes. Maybe they came up

300
00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:53.100
into something new, A big
thank you to our sponsors

I understand that there were
about 470 frames encompassing 38

319
00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:03.630
seconds. Does that sound right?
About 12 frames, a second.

320
00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:09.390
It's so 100, sorry, 1,350.
Oh, I'm sorry. So it

321
00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:13.980
must be there's three sequences,
correct? Yeah. There are five

322
00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:19.410
or sorry. There are five
cots. So is a 1,300

323
00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:24.360
friends. Wow. And is that
about 10 or 12 frames?

324
00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:29.040
A second, the frame per
second itself. It's I, I

325
00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:32.070
did it to sing more
into the music, so it's

326
00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:35.820
a very, it's it's it's
not a specific into one

327
00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:39.900
frame per second. Yeah, I
see. So you really kind

328
00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:45.180
of key frame it appropriately.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And

329
00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:48.150
you, would you did it
in Mike macro mind directly,

330
00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:51.300
or did that become macro
media someday, like purchased by

331
00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:55.680
them? That's correct. Yeah. It
was Macromedia video Wars and

332
00:22:55.680 --> 00:23:00.900
then micro made, sorry. It
was micromanage micromanage video works.

333
00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:04.950
And then the chance to
do macro mind director and

334
00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:11.280
change do Macromedia director until
they bought by Adobe. And

335
00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:12.930
one of the things I
thought was really interesting when

336
00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:15.570
I read about your workflow
is I, I realize that

337
00:23:15.570 --> 00:23:20.130
you're making an animated GIF
for some mediums, but you're

338
00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:23.880
doing this with hardware that
was created before animated gifs

339
00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:29.340
Existed. The animated GIF was
built in the modern computer.

340
00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:33.840
Right? Right. So you transfer
these picked this PI CT

341
00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:38.250
file, and you're using a
thing called the big mess

342
00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:41.880
of wires, floppy emulator. What
does this device give you?

343
00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:49.490
So this device really helped
me to save the pile

344
00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:53.030
into the modern storage, like
the SD card. So it's

345
00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:57.470
just like a, it's like
a device to breaching between

346
00:23:57.470 --> 00:24:01.700
the all computer into the
modern computer using the SD

347
00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:07.130
card. So this device connected
into the floppy drive port

348
00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:11.210
in the class. And if
you live, it's the, this

349
00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:15.650
image inside the SD card,
this, this inmates, contents the

350
00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:18.890
file. So I just went
and when, when I'm out,

351
00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:22.400
when I'm on the, this
email, it will appear in

352
00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:25.580
the desktop or the mucking
us. So I just put

353
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:31.160
copy or, or even transfer
the file into that, this

354
00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:34.700
image, because this image is
already in the SD card.

355
00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:37.580
So I can pull the
SD card to my MacBook

356
00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:42.140
pro. So particularly I'm reading
this in the same, this

357
00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:46.570
emits from them first. Wow.
So this is a business.

358
00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:49.510
This person has created this
physical device that allows you

359
00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:52.270
to Mount SD cards like
a real describe there's no

360
00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:57.610
drivers, it's lying to the
original Macintosh and telling it

361
00:24:57.610 --> 00:25:00.940
that it has a floppy
drive. Yeah. It's, it's interesting

362
00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:05.920
to see how people or
NTS enthusiast, a technology built

363
00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:10.000
into trying to bridge between
the old computer, into the

364
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.380
modern computer as if they
know something will happen. If

365
00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:17.140
we can connect into the
old this or come get

366
00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:23.440
them, because somehow they, they,
they share the same patient

367
00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:27.700
that maybe they have some
kids that want to access

368
00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:30.880
into the computer, not just
for nonstop. Yes, but also

369
00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:34.510
for creating something new. So
it's not just, it's not

370
00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:38.050
just this device, but also
if we looking into deep,

371
00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:42.970
deeper into the Apple two
community, they have like a

372
00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:47.230
SD card for the SD
card reader for the Apple,

373
00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:50.830
two Audra, Fiji for the
Apple two or even hard

374
00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:53.410
drive in front of Apple
to our network, into the

375
00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:58.990
modern, like a wifi. So
this community built a bridge.

376
00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:03.360
That's why I see that
it's a possibility for the

377
00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:07.420
technology, because I'm not very
very into with the electronic

378
00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:12.910
style, but this where these
helped me or how people

379
00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:17.590
do bridging between the old
computer to the modern computer

380
00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:23.680
and it create a purpose
from it. Yeah. I noticed

381
00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:26.260
that one of the themes
that I've identified in looking

382
00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:29.650
at your work over the
years is that you like

383
00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:33.610
to constrain yourself and then
see what you can do

384
00:26:33.610 --> 00:26:37.210
with that constraint. I noticed
that, you know, you, you

385
00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:40.900
make vines, you make videos,
then sometimes you'll work for

386
00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:44.730
hours for a six second
video. It seems like you

387
00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:47.520
would be perfect to be
on vine, but now vine

388
00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:50.040
has gone. How do you
feel about vine being gone?

389
00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:55.910
Fine. It's like a reminder
for me that everyone can

390
00:26:55.910 --> 00:26:59.810
create something if they they're
living in a very constant

391
00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:03.800
or very limited situation. So
it just like let that

392
00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:10.420
trigger our, our creativity, not
by so many options, but,

393
00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:13.070
but pick only one option
and then create something from

394
00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:17.390
it. So the six second
and the, and, and also

395
00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:22.580
we cannot import the video
from outside of pine itself.

396
00:27:22.610 --> 00:27:26.300
It's just like asking people,
what can you do with

397
00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:30.410
it? What can you do
with this limitation? So somehow

398
00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:35.390
it trigger me. It just
like I have something some,

399
00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:40.310
some, some earth to show
or proving that it's possible.

400
00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:44.000
So because it's already six
seconds, so I can do

401
00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.970
it before I sleep. Or
even though that they are,

402
00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:50.060
or even before I go
to work. So I can

403
00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:53.480
create just only smart animation,
traditional and industry with the

404
00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:57.590
paper and pencil and our
surprise that people were like

405
00:27:58.190 --> 00:28:03.590
the response very, very overwhelming.
I mean, they, they're not

406
00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:08.210
expecting that. There's a possibility
to create a hand rowing

407
00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:11.780
any method with the wine
itself. So based on that

408
00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:16.340
after death, so it's just
like a, become something in

409
00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:19.280
mind and be that, that
when that in the future,

410
00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:23.060
I have to create something,
press on the, something that

411
00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:27.500
impossible. What would you tell
people who watch these things,

412
00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:29.960
who look at your timeline,
who look at your photographs

413
00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:33.410
and they say, wow, that's
amazing. But this is only

414
00:28:33.410 --> 00:28:37.190
possible because he's so talented.
And he knows these things,

415
00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:40.700
but this is not For
me. That's because I am,

416
00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:44.570
maybe I'm just too much
to listen to my children,

417
00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:48.170
even their marbles into something
that doesn't make sense because

418
00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:53.510
I'm maybe me and my
wife always trying to reason

419
00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:57.140
something that doesn't make sense.
But basically it makes sense

420
00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:59.960
if we are thinking the
same frequency, if we are

421
00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:05.630
thinking the same imagination, translating
it to something realistic, it's

422
00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:09.170
possible. So it just like,
I don't know how to

423
00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:13.160
say the right word here,
but basically the kids give

424
00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:18.410
us guidance into something that
we cannot see right now

425
00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:23.600
because they have some freedom.
They have no fear into

426
00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:26.900
something like a failure or
mistake. Well, no one has

427
00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:29.690
ever told them. It's not
possible. The kids don't know

428
00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:32.630
you can't do this. So
they do it anyway. They

429
00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:35.480
do it anyway. They throw
it anyway, just like in

430
00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:38.750
the, my, my video in,
when I'm doing with my

431
00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:42.730
son with the stop motion
car, when he built, when

432
00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:47.890
he built the storyboard, he'd
just throw a fuel fuel

433
00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:52.240
pump. And I, and I
asked him, how can you,

434
00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:56.230
how do you want to
build with the fuel pump?

435
00:29:56.830 --> 00:30:02.920
He just said, I don't
know, but after death in

436
00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:05.800
the process, that's what, that's
what I said before is

437
00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:08.710
we are learning by doing
in the process. We just

438
00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:11.320
come up with something that,
can I use this as

439
00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:15.130
a fuel pump, just go
ahead. And it works. I

440
00:30:15.130 --> 00:30:19.240
mean, the spontaneously of, of,
of our children give us

441
00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:23.980
something that, you know, we
tend to plan for something.

442
00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:27.490
We have scheduled, we have
timeline. We have, we have

443
00:30:27.550 --> 00:30:33.390
planned, we have strategy, but
sometimes it distance us to,

444
00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:38.980
with another opportunity. It brings
a wall. It brings so

445
00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:44.560
many kid with a locked
door, but kids never see

446
00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:46.550
that kind of world then
for see, that's kind of,

447
00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:54.400
it just, everything is possible
for some common kid grow

448
00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:59.020
up, but sometimes we don't
need to grow up into

449
00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:01.720
something. So basically that's why
I came up with something

450
00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:06.360
like the fine, like I'm
doing like any mission, basically.

451
00:31:06.370 --> 00:31:12.520
Just when you say it's
possible, it's possible. Yeah. Well,

452
00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:15.130
thank you so much for
talking with me today. Yeah.

453
00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:18.910
Hopefully it's matched with your
expectation. I think it very

454
00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:22.690
much meets and exceeds my
expectations. I hope that everybody

455
00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:25.990
can go to Twitter and
follow Pinot at P I

456
00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:31.300
N O T. And also,
especially your Instagram at instagram.com/peanut.

457
00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:34.630
And I will put links
to all of these things

458
00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:38.070
that we talked about, including
where you can buy a

459
00:31:38.650 --> 00:31:41.350
copy of this and like
a poster size and put

460
00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:43.690
it on your, or your
wall. If you want to

461
00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:47.140
see all of these animations
available for printing. So thanks

462
00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:50.080
so much. This has been
wonderful. Thank you so much.

463
00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:54.340
This has been another episode
of Hanselminutes and we'll see

464
00:31:54.340 --> 00:32:15.820
you again next week. <inaudible>.
