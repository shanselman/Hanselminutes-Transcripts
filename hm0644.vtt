Hey friends, we have a
new sponsor today, and I

2
00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.410
want to make sure that
you support them because they

3
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.330
make Hansel minutes possible. Raven
DB, it's a document database

4
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.830
that's non-relational and fully transactional.
It's available for windows and

5
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.630
Linux with official client API
APIs for.net. The JVM go

6
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.470
Ruby, no JS and Python.
Raven DB is designed for

7
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.070
high performance handling tens of
thousands of requests, even on

8
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.370
a single node. Now, Raven
DB is capable of on

9
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:33.870
the fly optimization, dynamic indexes,
and much more. It has

10
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.660
a fully loaded gooey, which
means it's simpler to operate

11
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.360
and you don't need, you
know, arcane incantations on the

12
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.030
command line. It just works.
It's fast and it's right.

That's R a V E

00:00:48.390 --> 00:01:05.660
N db.net. Hope you check
it out. <inaudible> Hi, this

15
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.150
is Scott Hanselman. This is
another episode of Hansel minutes.

16
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.240
And today I'm talking with
dr. Nicole Forsgren. How are

17
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.320
you? I'm great. How are
you? Lovely. And I'm here

18
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.490
reading your report. You've just
released a report called accelerate

19
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.970
the state of dev ops
strategies for a new economy.

20
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.610
And you know, the first
thing that I see when

21
00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.440
I scroll down and I
look at the bottom, there's

22
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.550
a series of sponsors. I
usually assume that a dev

23
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.490
ops or any kind of
a research document, like this

24
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.680
would be sponsored by someone
that's trying to sell me

25
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.490
their thing, but I see
Amazon and I see Azure

26
00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.860
and Google cloud and a
bunch of other cloud people

27
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.940
that seems like a big
deal. I know. Right? So

28
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.050
the interesting thing, and the
really unique thing about this

29
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.320
report is that it's not
a vendor report, right? This

30
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.740
is not just a typical
vendor report. This is rigorous

31
00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.310
research. It's like rigorous academic
level research. I used to

32
00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.130
be a professor. I have
a PhD and it's vendor

33
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.730
and tool agnostic. You'll actually
notice several competitors on this

34
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.270
report. Like you note AWS
Azure, Google cloud is our

35
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.390
collaborator and our diamond sponsor.
And so as you kind

36
00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.300
of scroll through the report,
as you probably also noticed,

37
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.590
it talks about capabilities, it
talks about practices. It talks

38
00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.580
about strategies to drive high
performance. It doesn't ever talk

39
00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.690
about a particular tool. It
doesn't talk about particular things

40
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.670
except a couple of places
where we might list like

41
00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.910
an example, right? It talks
about ways to get better.

42
00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.800
It's never trying to sell
you anything. When someone looks

43
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.990
at a report like this,
I think that we, as

44
00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.350
the audience, we, as the
people who are listening, don't

45
00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.300
really have a way to
judge whether a report is

46
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.040
good or not. We might
look at it and say,

47
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.100
well, this is well-designed or
this looks pretty, or, but

48
00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.650
sometimes these reports can be
disguised. Like you say, as

49
00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.780
a vendor, a vendor could
create it to try to

50
00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.130
sell me something, but there
is a nontrivial amount of

51
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.710
research behind this, this isn't
opinion that we're looking at,

52
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.030
correct. Right. This is pretty
solid. So what we actually

53
00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.570
do, this is a five
or six month process. And,

54
00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.980
and again, right, as I
mentioned, this is academic research.

55
00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.000
So the team behind this
is myself, Jess, humble, gene

56
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.410
Kim. And we actually roll
this into academic research. This

57
00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.040
is published in peer review,
and we have also rolled

58
00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.530
this. This is year five
for us. The core team,

59
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.040
the first four years of
research have also been published

60
00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.980
in the book accelerate, in
addition to all of the

61
00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.940
academic research that we've also
published. So Right. And accelerate,

62
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.520
we're going to have a
link to this, the science

63
00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.570
behind DevOps with, as you
said yourself, as humble and

64
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.480
gene Kim published by it
revolution out of Portland, Oregon,

65
00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.910
where I am. Yeah. So,
and I guess to answer,

66
00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.560
you know, the, the second
half of what you're saying,

67
00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.680
you're right. It can be
really difficult to kind of

68
00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.500
figure out if someone's trying
to sell you something. Or

69
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.140
if it's real research, we
do our best to be

70
00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.220
really clear about what it
is that we're asking, what

71
00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.980
it is that we're doing.
We have a methods section

72
00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.010
at the back of every
research report that we've put

73
00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.220
out in the book. Part
two is all research, right?

74
00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.380
Which is funny. Cause some
people say, Oh, I didn't

75
00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.090
care about the research. I
just wanted to know what

76
00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.430
to do. And some people
say, Oh, the findings are

77
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.680
nice, but I've read the
reports. I really, really loved

78
00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.250
part two because it told
me exactly what to do

79
00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.160
for survey methods or what
to do for system measures

80
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.770
or what methods you were
using it this morning. I

81
00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.820
got a DM and Twitter
from someone saying, what clustering

82
00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.700
analysis method did you use?
And why did you select

83
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.380
that one? And I need
to know how to dig

84
00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.260
into this. So we really
do follow, you know, really

85
00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.550
rigorous methods that are not
only rigorous, but methodologically appropriate

86
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.910
for the questions that we're
asking. So, so not to

87
00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.550
put too fine, a point
on it. This is not

88
00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.370
someone put out a survey
monkey and then went into

89
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.320
Excel and made some charts.
I'm looking at the end

90
00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.630
here. And there is an
actual whole section of the

91
00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:02.250
report that talks about your
statistical analysis methods, structural equation

92
00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:07.020
modeling and extensive footnotes on
the research and the validation

93
00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.870
guidelines. Right? And I love
that you point that out,

94
00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.290
right? Structural equation modeling. We're
also very, very careful to

95
00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:18.600
make explicit distinctions between what
things are summarization, right? Descriptive

96
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.290
analysis. So we have things
about demographics and firmographics. What

97
00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:26.550
percentage of the industry responded
where we are very careful

98
00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.790
to point out which things
are correlations, which things are

99
00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:34.650
predictions, because we do take
this a step beyond just

100
00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.280
correlation, which things can you
do that have been statistically

101
00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:44.520
shown to drive performance improvements
across different areas of your

102
00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.010
business. Oh, and by can
I like skip to a

103
00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:50.910
spoiler? This is so my
favorite thing, can I just

104
00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.370
like dig into it because
this is what so everyone's

105
00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:54.960
like, Oh, but this isn't
going to work for me.

106
00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:57.890
Right. Our analysis for the
last couple of years. And

107
00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.080
in particular this year, I
went ahead and just dove

108
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:05.120
into it even harder this
year we found statistically industry

109
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.380
doesn't matter, right? In a
predictive way, there is no

110
00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:14.270
statistical evidence to say that
industry matters. So if anyone

111
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.540
out there is saying, or
their management is saying, Oh,

112
00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:20.420
well, this won't work for
us. These practices or principles,

113
00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:23.630
whether you want to call
them digital transformation or DevOps

114
00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:26.360
or agile, you know, it
won't work for us because

115
00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.670
I work in highly regulated
fields. You know, I work

116
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:32.060
in finance. I work in
telecom. I work in healthcare.

117
00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.810
This won't work for us
because we, we are highly

118
00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:39.650
regulated. No, you know what?
I have data across. Well,

119
00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:42.800
first of all, I have
over 30,000 data points around

120
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.980
the world in dozens of
industries. And I've run this

121
00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:49.910
analysis and I did the
most rigorous statistical control methods

122
00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:53.030
that I could do in
our predictive models. And there

123
00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:57.530
was no statistical evidence that
it matters. And I didn't

124
00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.350
even just group it into
highly regulated or nine highly

125
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:02.660
regulated because then someone could
come back and say, Oh,

126
00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:06.950
but we're more special. Right?
We're more highly regulated. I

127
00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:12.440
tested per industry. I tested
technology separately, financial services, separately,

128
00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:17.420
government, separately, healthcare and pharma,
separately insurance separately, telecom separately.

129
00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:22.150
There's no significance there. How
can we, as, as non

130
00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:27.670
PhDs, except that stuff that
is intuitively correct is in

131
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:32.560
fact demonstrably wrong. Like I
used to work in banking

132
00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:36.130
and I would tell you
that my gut says that

133
00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:39.400
it's highly regulated environment and,
you know, velocity and those

134
00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.970
things and matter. And these
things won't work for us.

135
00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:44.350
And my wife works in
healthcare. But when you then

136
00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:46.180
show the data that says,
it's not the case, why

137
00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:47.770
do we think these things?
Why do we feel them

138
00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:50.380
in our gut and then
find them not true? Well,

139
00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:53.140
so it's really interesting, right?
It's so interesting. You say

140
00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:57.100
that because so often people
will come back and they

141
00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.920
will say, you know, it's
so great to see this

142
00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:03.370
data because it helps me
confirm what I see and

143
00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:05.470
what I know to be
true. And that'll have people

144
00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:07.930
come back and they'll say,
Oh, this is so interesting

145
00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:11.140
because it's the opposite of
what I see. Right? And

146
00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:14.680
so sometimes people accuse me
of just doing confirmation bias,

147
00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:18.040
but we see surprises come
up in the data, right?

148
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:23.920
Like we really follow the
classic scientific method. We generate

149
00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:31.030
hypothesis first, right? Based on
industry experience, based on the

150
00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:33.850
academic literature, based on a
lot of things that we

151
00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:37.060
want to test. And then
we have like full rigorous

152
00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:39.640
research design to figure out
what data we need to

153
00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:42.760
collect in order to test
these hypotheses. And then we

154
00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:44.590
go collect the data and
then I go through several

155
00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:45.880
steps to kind of test
it. And then we do

156
00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:49.960
test it. And so we
do have this situation where

157
00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:57.270
sometimes these biases or pre
suppositions are confirmed and sometimes

158
00:08:57.270 --> 00:09:00.420
they're totally flipped on their
head. Right? One of my

159
00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:06.210
favorites is the idea that
speed and stability are a

160
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:09.750
trade off. Now, some people
have this firmly, firmly held

161
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:12.660
belief that in order to
be stable, we have to

162
00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:16.830
slow down. We have to,
but there's another core set

163
00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:19.440
of people that at least
for a decade now have

164
00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:23.400
said, no, I really believe
in my heart that if

165
00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:26.610
we go faster, we will
be more stable. So how

166
00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:29.400
do, how do we reconcile
these two stories and how

167
00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:32.700
can, how can two groups
of people believe something differently?

168
00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:36.270
How can we have two
stories simultaneously? So one story

169
00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:40.680
says, I have to slow
down to be safe and

170
00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:43.620
to be stable. And, and
that story, that story makes

171
00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:46.830
sense. Right? I can perceive,
I can envision a story

172
00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:51.000
where slower releases are more
safe because I can check

173
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.140
it. I can test it.
I can reassure myself. Now,

174
00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:58.560
there's also another story that
we can envision that says,

175
00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:02.790
if I go faster, it's
safer and it's more stable

176
00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:06.630
because going faster means slower
release, smaller releases. I mean,

177
00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:11.820
write smaller bits, smaller risk,
right? I'm introducing smaller pieces

178
00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:16.500
and smaller risks. So it's
actually more sustainable, but their

179
00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:20.010
intention, these are opposite stories.
What we found over the

180
00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:23.460
last five years is that
speed and stability move in

181
00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:27.150
tandem. The highest performers get
both. There is no trade

182
00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:29.360
off. Yeah. And you point
out here in the report

183
00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:32.990
that this is not a
surprise this year, this is

184
00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:35.870
five years in a row
that your cluster analysis has

185
00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:41.540
shown the relationship between throughput
and stability. Right. And this

186
00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:44.000
is something that we let
the data drive, right. We,

187
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.030
we did have this hypothesis,
well, an early on, right.

188
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:50.090
We're like, I wonder which
story is correct. Right. I

189
00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:53.450
wonder, I genuinely am curious.
And it was funny because

190
00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:54.980
you know, gene and jazz
would come in there. Like,

191
00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:56.840
I, I think I know
what it is. And I'm

192
00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:58.880
like, that's cool. I'm going
to let the data, tell

193
00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:02.030
me Well, and speaking of
the data, you, you, you

194
00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:05.660
point out the data, the
spread from the kind of

195
00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:08.870
the elite people that have
their, their dev ops experience,

196
00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:12.830
their CIC D kind of
really dialed in versus the

197
00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:14.480
folks that are the, what
we would call the low

198
00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:17.540
performers and no disrespect to
them. But we've all worked

199
00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:23.150
there where, you know, FTP
every few months into production

200
00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:26.450
is your deployment strategy. You
point out some pretty crazy

201
00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:29.540
statistics. I just want to
read these really briefly, 46

202
00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:36.410
times more frequent code deployments,
2,555 times faster lead time

203
00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:39.590
from commit to deploy. That's
a, that's a number we

204
00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:44.030
get to talk about. Yeah.
That makes me very uncomfortable.

205
00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.240
That means that someone might
check something in, in January

206
00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.640
and not see it in
production until March or July.

207
00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:53.680
And the elite performance have
a much lower change rate.

208
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:57.540
They're less likely to fail.
Right. And now when we

209
00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:01.830
think about that though, it's
because when you do introduce

210
00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:07.140
code, you're introducing very, very
small pieces of code. So

211
00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:12.390
that introduction is small. It
has a small blast radius.

212
00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:15.660
Oh, that's what touches, right.
It touches much less of

213
00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:18.660
your code base. When we
think about making a change

214
00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:20.940
to code. Right. I mean,
I use, I was a

215
00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:23.970
developer for a little while.
Right. We all think, Oh,

216
00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:26.470
I'm going to introduce this
piece of code. How it's

217
00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:29.760
not going to break anything.
Of course it always breaks

218
00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:33.360
something. Right. If I introduce
a one line change, how

219
00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:35.850
likely is that to break
something? It depends on the

220
00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:37.890
line. It depends on the
line. Okay. But if I

221
00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:41.100
introduce a hundred line or
a thousand line change, how

222
00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:43.320
likely is that to break
something Well, and then that's

223
00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:45.300
where you start getting into,
like you say, the blast

224
00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:47.100
radius. I mean, you throw
a pebble into a problem

225
00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:51.000
And how big is the
blast and how big is

226
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.850
the change and how big
is your downtime? So the

227
00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:57.360
other thing that we discovered
this year, so we discovered

228
00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:00.090
these elite performers that are
very much like the high

229
00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:04.020
performers in previous years. Right?
They're optimizing speed and stability

230
00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:06.330
because, Oh, Oh, I have
so many things I want

231
00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:10.110
to talk about. So I'll
start with my high performers

232
00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:14.280
and my elite performers, the
highest performers really are this

233
00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:17.790
group that is optimizing on
speed and stability. They're what

234
00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:21.570
we call high-performers in previous
years, right? They're this group

235
00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:24.660
that is continuing to push
the bar. They're continuing to

236
00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:27.750
move forward. They don't make
excuses. They're doing well. Year

237
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:30.180
over year, over year, we
have this high performance group

238
00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:34.680
as well. Okay. They're 46%
of the market of the

239
00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:39.990
industry, or sorry, 48%. I
love this because it's this

240
00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:45.960
incredible signal that high performance
is available to everyone. We're

241
00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:49.410
seeing this huge shift in
the industry that this is

242
00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:55.080
achievable. It all comes down
to execution, right? Trent, you

243
00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:58.080
actually have a, I'm looking
at the report right now

244
00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:01.140
on page 20, you, you
are showing the performance metrics

245
00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:06.720
over time, 2016, 2017, 2018.
And it's, it's accelerating that

246
00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:09.570
movement. People are moving from
low to high to elite

247
00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:12.450
are moving forward and becoming
better at this. And the

248
00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:16.740
time to restore service and
incidents, their failure rates, these

249
00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:19.800
things are changing. They are
failing fast and failing often,

250
00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:24.240
and they're getting their sites
back up faster, Right? So

251
00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:28.050
the high group is continuing
to grow. It's continuing to

252
00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:32.130
improve. The elites are the
best are staying at the

253
00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:35.940
top of their game. The
low performers though, are starting

254
00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:41.790
to fall behind at increasingly
larger rates. Right? The change

255
00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:44.670
failure rate is getting higher.
And we think it's because

256
00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:48.420
of increasing complexity in our
systems, right? When you do

257
00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:52.700
go down, you go down
hard, you the systems, or

258
00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:55.280
is it the people in
their processes? It could be

259
00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:57.920
some of both right. The
processes. Aren't great. We can't

260
00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:02.060
keep up right. Our practices.
Aren't great. And so, and

261
00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:05.570
when you combine those two
that's even harder, right? So

262
00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:09.830
we discovered this additional group
at the bottom of this

263
00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:13.880
low performance group, and we
called them misguided performers. And

264
00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:16.100
at first I had to
convince my team a little

265
00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:18.950
bit about why I wanted
to name them misguided because

266
00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:20.870
they were like, Oh, that's
not very nice. And I'm

267
00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:24.590
like, yeah, but that's why
it's kind of perfect. Right?

268
00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:27.020
It's like, when you make
your mom mad, like there's

269
00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:29.570
making your mom mad and
then there's disappointing your mom,

270
00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:33.880
right. Don't disappoint. Like the
worst thing you can do.

271
00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:37.870
So the misguided performance, let
me describe them again. This

272
00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:40.750
is very, this is completely
data driven. Okay. And by

273
00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:43.450
the way, I will point
out this is 5% of

274
00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:45.940
our data. So this is
a nontrivial group, right? This

275
00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:49.570
is a good, solid set
they're deploying between once every

276
00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:51.880
six months. So their lead
time for changes is also

277
00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:55.900
between once every six months.
So this like a reasonable

278
00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:57.970
cadence right there, there's going
to be a whole bunch

279
00:15:57.970 --> 00:16:01.390
of people out there probably
in highly regulated fields in

280
00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:06.580
government. They're like, yeah, that
seems good. Their change failure

281
00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:10.480
rate is actually better than
our lowest performers. When they

282
00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:13.330
introduce a change to the
system, they only fail between

283
00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:17.440
16 and 30% of the
time. So they're like sweet.

284
00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:22.240
We're doing pretty well, probably
because they have instituted strong

285
00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:28.390
policies and extra testing, extra
quality control, right? So like

286
00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:31.450
I'm imagining this story. Not
even imagining. I work with

287
00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:34.270
clients, I work with customers.
I work with organizations that

288
00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:37.090
say, we're going to take
a slow and steady approach.

289
00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:40.480
We have this cautious approach
to releasing software. It's slow,

290
00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:44.560
but we have instituted so
many guardrails around it. Okay.

291
00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:48.880
But when they go down,
they are deploying such large,

292
00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:51.490
large pieces of software that
when they go down, they

293
00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:55.990
go down hard. They're down
between one and six months.

294
00:16:56.290 --> 00:16:58.300
And people look at me
and they make this face

295
00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:00.580
like one in six months
to call you're crazy. Your

296
00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:06.220
analysis is wrong. It's not
though, because think about healthcare.gov.

297
00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:10.900
Think about Sony, right? Like
when Sony was hacked four

298
00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:13.990
times in a row, right?
When they had security breaches,

299
00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:17.950
customers might be able to
access the system between like

300
00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:23.860
hours or days later. But
how long are we fixing

301
00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:28.300
systems on the backend? Right?
We are having to fix

302
00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:33.970
systems and infrastructure and restore
data for weeks or months.

303
00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:41.140
This is a nontrivial problem.
So when you spend months

304
00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:44.680
getting ready to release software,
as we just talked about,

305
00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:48.940
you were releasing this huge
piece of change into the

306
00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:53.910
system, that you can no
longer understand the implications of

307
00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:58.190
Ish. When you said that
the things can go down

308
00:17:58.190 --> 00:18:01.280
for that long. I just,
I went to, because I

309
00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.590
would just assume that that
was an outlier. Like I

310
00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:07.550
remember healthcare.gov. I remember Sony.
I remember the early, early

311
00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:10.730
days of Xbox live, but
now we, as customers are

312
00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:13.040
used to outages being a
couple of hours. I mean,

313
00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:15.890
even, I think it was
get lab many, many, many

314
00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:18.710
years ago, I think deleted
a production database. But even

315
00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:21.230
that was still measured in,
you know, a day or

316
00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:24.890
a day and a half
months seemed unconscionable. But I

317
00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:27.110
mean, think of it. There
are still websites right now

318
00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:29.870
that have planned outages for
a whole day on a

319
00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:33.200
weekend. You mentioned that I
literally saw a tweet about

320
00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.930
this. And someone said it's
2018. And my bank is

321
00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:38.630
still down for like six
hours once a month. And

322
00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:41.600
you're not getting five, nine,
six hours down a month.

323
00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:45.740
Right. And those are planned
outages. What happens when you

324
00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:48.800
have an unplanned outage? And
again, this is, this is

325
00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:52.070
not customer facing downtime. This
is what happens when you're

326
00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:55.010
down, something happens and you
have to go down. Yes,

327
00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:58.490
the customers might be back
up in a day, but

328
00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:01.070
how long does it take
the rest of the team

329
00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:04.550
to pull your entirety of
your system and your infrastructure

330
00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:08.210
and your data back online.
And, but, and, but still,

331
00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:10.370
you would say that if
you were, if a seat,

332
00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:12.440
if we could grab a
CPO for like a small

333
00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:14.960
credit union and then just
drop them on this, this

334
00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:19.310
podcast right now, they would
probably, you know, harrumph and

335
00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:21.590
they would say, well, you
know, it's important to be

336
00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:24.200
cautious, it's money. We're talking
about blah, blah, blah, highly

337
00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:28.670
regulated, blah, blah, blah, safety
of the customer. Sure. Safety,

338
00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:30.830
the customer. How much is
it costing you to be

339
00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:34.040
down like this? Because also
when you're down, let's think

340
00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:38.810
about risk exposure, security. And
if you can own there

341
00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:41.240
to also relate to things
in here, if it takes

342
00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:45.080
you months to get a
change through what happens to

343
00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:48.920
your security posture, when you
need to get a patch

344
00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:54.410
through compliance, update through a
security patch through, and it

345
00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:57.530
takes you months to get
through. And then what's the

346
00:19:57.530 --> 00:20:01.700
difference between your regular change
process and your emergency change

347
00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:05.240
process? It's well, one thing
I might think about which

348
00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:07.070
actually you touch on a
little bit in the report,

349
00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:09.770
as well as the idea
of manual work versus automated

350
00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:12.080
work, a lot of people
would argue that those downtimes

351
00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:16.580
are, are a time for
manual tasks that require a

352
00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:20.540
great deal of attention to
detail. Sure. And we all

353
00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:25.310
know that manual work, particularly
in times of stress and

354
00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:28.970
overwork and burnout is where
we tend to see more

355
00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:32.090
mistakes happen and by no
fault of the people working.

356
00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:35.810
So then you're only introducing
more risk and more error.

357
00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:39.200
And by the way, the
thing I just mentioned when

358
00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:45.500
we are introducing changes in
emergency situations, the emergency changes

359
00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:47.680
that we're trying to introduce
into the system as quickly

360
00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:50.800
as we can to recover
from failure. The big difference

361
00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:55.300
there is we usually skip
testing, which is the time

362
00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:58.320
that we should not be
skipping testing. Ooh, that's a

363
00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:02.400
tough one. I've been in
the data center at the

364
00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:04.860
bank when that happened. If
it's such a, okay, everyone

365
00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:07.620
let's test, you know, Ooh,
that's tough, Right? I mean,

366
00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:09.930
I've, I've been working on
systems that are down at

367
00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:14.190
hospitals and were hours away
from evacuating and ICU. And

368
00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:18.510
we're desperately trying to Institute
emergency changes. And right then

369
00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:20.100
it's like, we have to
get this change and we

370
00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:22.830
don't have time for tests.
And suddenly we're like, Oh

371
00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:25.140
my gosh, we don't, we
don't have time for tests

372
00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:28.950
like we're dear God and
heaven, please let this change

373
00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:32.820
work. Right. A big thank
you to our sponsors because

374
00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:34.860

389
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:35.130
I k.com/hanselman. Your elites are
doing very little manual testing.

390
00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:37.920
They're doing a lot less
manual testing than the highs

391
00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:41.160
and the mediums. It's, it's
a very, an elite performer

392
00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.470
and the dev ops space
is a very automated group

393
00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:48.240
Or their aunt, or they're
doing it very strategically. They

394
00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:55.290
have incredibly efficient test suites.
They have great parallelization so

395
00:22:55.290 --> 00:22:59.550
that they can be very,
very strategic about exploratory testing,

396
00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:05.820
manual testing, where it matters,
right, are low performers. And

397
00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:08.490
especially our medium performers. If
you don't have those test

398
00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:11.850
suites in place, you're then
having to do manual testing,

399
00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:16.350
right? You're having to bang
on the system everywhere. But

400
00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:19.200
if you have these incredible
test suites in place, that

401
00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:22.440
by the way, have been
developed by developers and by

402
00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:26.820
testers, because when developers help
write tests, we write better

403
00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:30.030
and more testable code, right?
When we know that it's

404
00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:32.250
going to need to be
tested, rewrite more testable code.

405
00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:35.970
But if we have everyone
having to do all of

406
00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:40.260
our tests manually, that's just
not scalable. And these are

407
00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:42.420
best practices though. One of
the things that I feel

408
00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:45.410
like people aren't recognizing is
that we are standing on

409
00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:48.140
the shoulders of giants for
a reason, like a lot

410
00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:52.280
of these things that people,
these characteristics of elite performers

411
00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:57.950
are best practices. And the
people who are identifiably, demonstrably,

412
00:23:57.950 --> 00:24:02.810
medium and low performers are,
are shunning best practices, right.

413
00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:07.060
Explicitly, and, and they're paying
the price, Right. And you

414
00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:10.180
know, it's not always their
fault or, you know, they're

415
00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:13.990
just scrambling to try to
keep up. Yeah. You have

416
00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:16.990
a quote here where you
say the teams that adopt

417
00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:21.250
essential cloud characteristics are 23
times more likely to be

418
00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:24.610
elite performers. What are cloud
characteristics and why is it,

419
00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:27.520
You know, I love this
part of the report. So

420
00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:29.590
I'm going to give a
tiny bit of context. I

421
00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:32.920
so often when we do
this research and I, I

422
00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:35.590
will point this out too.
We do point out that

423
00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:37.750
to kind of work into
the section of the report.

424
00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:41.080
We ask questions about where
people are. Are they in

425
00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:42.640
the cloud? Are they not
in the cloud? And we

426
00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:45.340
say, you know, the fact
that we, as an industry

427
00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:48.370
are unclear about if we're
in the cloud or not

428
00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:52.930
can explain why so many
reports and vendor reports don't

429
00:24:52.930 --> 00:24:57.130
reflect our experience. And so
when we're doing research and

430
00:24:57.130 --> 00:25:00.160
even internal to our own
organizations, when we're doing metrics

431
00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:04.510
and monitoring and reporting, it's
so important to make sure

432
00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:07.420
we have good, solid definitions
of what it is that

433
00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:09.370
we think we're reporting on
and what it is we

434
00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:11.920
think we're measuring. And so
one thing we did in

435
00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:15.010
the report is I included
sort of a gotcha question.

436
00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:18.940
Honestly, we started by asking
if people are in the

437
00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:22.300
cloud, just a simple question,
right? If you're PR if

438
00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:24.640
the primary service or application
that you're working on is

439
00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:26.830
in the cloud, how much
do you agree with that

440
00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:32.290
statement? And then we moved
on to a very solid

441
00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:35.800
definition of what cloud computing
is. And we pulled that

442
00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:40.270
from nest, right? National Institute
of standards, the technology, because

443
00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:42.910
they have a definition of
what it actually means to

444
00:25:42.910 --> 00:25:45.580
be doing cloud computing. And
it pulls down to five

445
00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:49.150
essential characteristics. And so then
we asked people if they

446
00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:52.180
do these five things for
the primary service or application

447
00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:56.080
that they work on, and
only 22% of people who

448
00:25:56.350 --> 00:25:59.710
previously said that they're working
in the cloud are actually

449
00:25:59.710 --> 00:26:04.960
doing these five things. And
I think this helps illuminate

450
00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:07.810
what's happening when people say,
well, you know, we moved

451
00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:09.220
to the cloud, but we
don't see any of the

452
00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:11.230
benefits that people say come
from the cloud. And we're

453
00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:14.500
like, okay. Yeah, like you
can't just say you're in

454
00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:16.930
the cloud and it doesn't
work. Right. I think Corey

455
00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:19.060
Quinn had this hilarious tweet
the other day saying like,

456
00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:20.800
you can't just like throw
a sticker on your data

457
00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:23.410
center and say that you're
in the cloud now. So

458
00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:27.400
these five characteristics of what
actually makes cloud computing or

459
00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:32.140
this. So the first is
on demand, self service. You

460
00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:37.030
can provision resources as needed
automatically without human interaction. Can

461
00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:39.730
you, you can't put in
a ticket if you use

462
00:26:39.730 --> 00:26:44.640
a ticket fail, sorry, love
you. Fail. Number, number two,

463
00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:50.850
broad network access capabilities are
available through anything. Mobile phones,

464
00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:55.170
tablets, laptops, workstations, right? Kate
broad network access. Number three

465
00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:58.830
is resource pooling. Resources are
pooled in like a multitenant

466
00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:02.730
model. Okay. So physical virtual
resources are dynamically assigned and

467
00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:09.090
reassigned on demand. Number four,
rapid elasticity. So that most

468
00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:10.890
people think about this when
we think about the cloud,

469
00:27:10.890 --> 00:27:13.230
right? So we can think
about like bursting and stuff.

470
00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:17.100
And then number five is
measured service. So here is

471
00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:19.650
where our cloud systems can
kind of automatically control and

472
00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:22.590
optimize resource use. And again,
this is where kind of

473
00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:25.770
the bursting comes, right? And
the resource usage can be

474
00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:30.090
monitored controlled and reported for
transparency. This, this one's also

475
00:27:30.090 --> 00:27:33.400
really nice, right? Because of
the reporting aspect, The, the,

476
00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:37.220
the, the elasticity aspect of
things. I love that word

477
00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:40.760
in the context of the
cloud, the idea that, you

478
00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:44.030
know, provision and release stuff
that I could that's scaling,

479
00:27:44.030 --> 00:27:47.270
isn't a life event like
it used to be Right?

480
00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:50.030
Oh yeah. I was. I
mean, I remember those days.

481
00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:51.590
I love how you say
that it's not a life

482
00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:57.740
event. I work@acompanycallediteighthundred.com. Like literally
it was eight zero, zero.com.

483
00:27:58.070 --> 00:27:59.690
You probably should not go
there now because I have

484
00:27:59.690 --> 00:28:01.610
no idea what's there, but
this was back in the

485
00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:03.530
early days of the internet
when it was like everything

486
00:28:03.530 --> 00:28:08.270
had three, three letter domains,
right? Like, Oh yeah. I

487
00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:13.070
worked@eighthundreddotcomandiworkedatgear.com. When Nick, when you
could actually like, have that

488
00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:16.190
idea for a noun and
use all the vowels and

489
00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:18.350
consonants, you didn't have to
remove a vowel to be

490
00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:22.970
creative. And I remember when
we, we went and sold

491
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.480
three DVDs for a dollar
that was our big black

492
00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:31.310
Friday sale and scaling from
three machines to six, like

493
00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:35.390
involved driving down to PC
micro center and getting the

494
00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:39.170
machines and racking them. Like
it was rapid elasticity was

495
00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:41.570
scaling in a week and
a half, two week period.

496
00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:45.020
And it was extremely stressful
and it was, but it

497
00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:47.570
was the way that we
did DevOps 20 years ago.

498
00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:52.430
Oh yeah. Well, and back
then, it was much more

499
00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:55.610
difficult, right? Like it was
a lot harder. We, we

500
00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:59.540
didn't really have, you know,
distributed systems set up the

501
00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:01.430
way we do now. I
mean, I used to work

502
00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:03.710
in data centers. My first
job was on a mainframe.

503
00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:06.110
So I, I mean, I,
I feel this, I was

504
00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:09.380
working in labs. I was
laying cable. So The, the,

505
00:29:09.390 --> 00:29:12.010
the report can be, can
be gotten online and I'm

506
00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:13.970
gonna make sure that we
have a link to that

507
00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:17.060
at cloud platform, online.com. And
there's a link to go

508
00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:18.560
directly to that. I'll make
a little link and I'll

509
00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:20.240
tweet about it as well.
But I also want to

510
00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:24.680
point out there's even more
depth in the book, accelerate

511
00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:28.430
the science behind dev ops.
It's like 200, 300 page

512
00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:31.790
book. And you got some
praise from people that don't

513
00:29:31.790 --> 00:29:35.810
typically praise books. You've got
common, Mary Poppins pick in

514
00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:40.550
there. You've got Martin Fowler.
Why did this book like

515
00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:43.240
land so well? Is it
because of the rigor of

516
00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:46.350
the science behind it? I
think there's a few things,

517
00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:48.870
right. I think the rigor
really helps because then it's

518
00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:51.900
not just a bunch of
like, this is, I think

519
00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:53.850
this is a good idea.
I think this is kind

520
00:29:53.850 --> 00:29:57.900
of an opinion. I know.
Yeah. The rigor really convinced

521
00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:00.600
Martin, you know, we've, he's
been following our work for

522
00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:03.360
the last few years and
I will actually say he,

523
00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:05.610
he was sort of a
big nudge in writing it.

524
00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:08.580
I bumped into him at
a conference and he pulled

525
00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:10.020
me aside and he said,
you've got to write this

526
00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:12.390
book. And I'm like, dude,
I know. Right. I'm busy.

527
00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:14.220
And he goes, no, if
you don't write it, I

528
00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:17.310
will. I was like, Whoa,
what? So he was kidding.

529
00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:19.620
I probably bumped into you.
And he's like, you need

530
00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:24.350
to write this. And you're
like, dude, I know, I

531
00:30:24.570 --> 00:30:27.870
don't know. He was so
funny. Well, and then I,

532
00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:30.390
I told him later that
you know, his threat to

533
00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:33.450
write the book and if
I didn't, he would, he

534
00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:35.070
goes, I was kidding. And
I was like, well, it's

535
00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:37.500
probably good. I didn't know
you were kidding because that's

536
00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:41.520
what kicked my button to
get there. The case of

537
00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:43.380
Sal, Ron has turned in
our direction. We'd better get

538
00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:46.650
this book out before Fowler
writes it for us. Exactly.

539
00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:49.530
So, and it's interesting because
that also made sure that

540
00:30:49.530 --> 00:30:51.690
I had a really, really
solid section in the back.

541
00:30:51.690 --> 00:30:54.900
So the interesting thing is
some people love the whole

542
00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:57.900
book. Some people really love
part. So we have three

543
00:30:57.900 --> 00:31:02.070
parts. Part. One is everything
that we have found. It's

544
00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:05.400
so the, the findings, the
results, Right? What we found

545
00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:08.970
the research and transformation. Yep.
The research and transformation part

546
00:31:08.970 --> 00:31:12.210
two is the science behind
it. My nerd moment came

547
00:31:12.210 --> 00:31:14.610
when my PhD advisor texted
me and she said, this

548
00:31:14.610 --> 00:31:19.050
is like a beautiful take
on kind of an elegant

549
00:31:19.050 --> 00:31:22.860
take on survey measures and
how to do them and

550
00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:24.630
how to lay it out
the right way, but also

551
00:31:24.630 --> 00:31:26.760
how it relates to a
few other people have actually

552
00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:28.800
DMD me, which I think
I'm a little proud of

553
00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:32.040
too, how to relate it
to system measures. So if

554
00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:34.230
you're in an organization and
you want to capture measures

555
00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:36.300
out of systems, cause that's
actually what I started from

556
00:31:37.050 --> 00:31:40.260
doing like systems and log
analysis and how to think

557
00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:42.600
about measures this way, how
to relate them and how

558
00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:44.490
to measure things and how
to think about them and

559
00:31:44.490 --> 00:31:47.670
put data together and analyze
it in a good holistic

560
00:31:47.670 --> 00:31:51.030
way. Some people really love
that. Cause like they've read

561
00:31:51.030 --> 00:31:53.880
the reports or they're like,
I already know what I'm

562
00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:56.670
doing, but I need to
think about measurement in an

563
00:31:56.670 --> 00:32:01.440
organization and communicating measurement. And
then part three is a

564
00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:04.110
case study from ING. So
how to put all of

565
00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:07.560
this into practice. And that
was actually contributed by Steve

566
00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:09.990
bell and Karen Whitley bell. They
were very, very lovely and

567
00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:12.480
gracious. They were early readers
to the book and they

568
00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:15.600
said, you know, you really,
it might help people to

569
00:32:15.930 --> 00:32:18.930
be able to visualize what
this looks like in practice.

570
00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:23.280
And I said, you know,
my, I think I am

571
00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:26.880
best served writing about the
science and I've, I've helped

572
00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:29.370
organizations through this and we
were on a phone call

573
00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:31.860
and they said, we'd be
willing to write it for

574
00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:34.080
you. And I was like,
Oh my gosh, what? Yes.

575
00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:37.170
Thank you. So yeah, it
was, it was fantastic. So

576
00:32:37.170 --> 00:32:38.730
it was nice that it
kind of came together in

577
00:32:38.730 --> 00:32:42.500
those three parts. Right? Yeah.
And some people love that

578
00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:45.320
part the best because they
can see it and feel

579
00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:47.270
it. And the way that,
that Steven care and have

580
00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:49.190
written, it is really like
a day in the life.

581
00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:52.210
It's walking through one on
one Point out also, just

582
00:32:52.210 --> 00:32:55.120
as we close those podcast
here, that you would think

583
00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:57.760
that a books with this
much work behind it, which

584
00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:59.800
meant this much science would
be very expensive and you'd

585
00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:02.860
be spending 50, 60 bucks
on it. But you can

586
00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:04.870
go up on Amazon right
now. And the Kindle version

587
00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:06.970
of this book is very
modestly priced or you can

588
00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:09.640
get it in paperback. And
I think it's just a

589
00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:12.550
fantastic resource. This is not
a pamphlet. This is 300

590
00:33:12.550 --> 00:33:17.020
pages of really, really thoughtful
research by some experienced folks

591
00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:19.120
in the space. And I
really appreciate you coming on

592
00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:21.850
the show with me today.
Yeah. Thanks for having me.

593
00:33:21.850 --> 00:33:25.390
It's been great to chat.
This has been another episode

594
00:33:25.390 --> 00:33:27.730
of Hansel minutes and we'll
see you again next week.
