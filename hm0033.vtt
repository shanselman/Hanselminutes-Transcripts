In this episode, Scott and
Carl discussed features of windows

16
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:35.340
Vista released candidate. Number one.
Hi, this is Carl Franklin. You're

17
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.190
listening to Hansel minutes. I'm
here with Scott Hanselman as

18
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.270
I usually am every week.
Hi Scott. Hello, sir. How's

19
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.530
Portland, Oregon. Today. It is
getting a little nippy, a

20
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.020
little cold. I feel the
same thing in new England.

21
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.950
Yep. But it's all good.
We have no floods hurricanes,

22
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.150
tornadoes or earthquakes yet today
and I'm sure there's some

23
00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.200
lovely vistas out there. There
are. In fact there is

24
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.750
a release candidate of a
lovely Vista just over the

25
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.430
West Hills. Yeah. Release candidate
running Vista. You know, I

26
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:12.270
tried and I'm probably gonna,
I, the problem was I

27
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.290
tried to install it on
a raid Stripe and drivers

28
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.500
being what they are, you
know, one, a whole bunch

29
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.070
of blogs said that this
particular driver worked and it

30
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.310
didn't. So I'm going to
go back to installing it

31
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.760
on a, on a straight
disc, I think. But yeah,

32
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.090
I am working on it
at the moment. So I

33
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.080
went, I went like a
putz, like a shmuck and

34
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.420
I went and I installed
it just on one in

35
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.110
one kind of big, crazy
evening on my wife's little

36
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.950
cheap $300 office Depot name
brand nice. I might on

37
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.490
my own personal, you know,
have been building it for

38
00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.060
years. Fry's electronics, bringing it
back to life with a

39
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.800
new motherboard, every few years
machine and my tablet and

40
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.780
I had enough trouble With
those three machines that I

41
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.350
stopped before I hit my
media center PC. Yeah. But

42
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.750
I got a pretty good
view of what's going on

43
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.040
because I've got a pretty
wide series of computers there,

44
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.250
you know? So what can
we tell the people about

45
00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:22.020
Vista? Well, if you're doing
anything tricky, funny drivers, funny

46
00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.220
hardware, anything fancy, you've got
about a 50, 50 chance

47
00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.430
of things working. For example,
one of the things that

48
00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.040
I really liked about windows
XP pro and this is,

49
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.840
you know, years ago and
I mean like the very

50
00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.990
first time I put XP
pro on a machine, I

51
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.930
took my old quick cam
express, my old logic tech

52
00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.920
quick cam and I plugged
it in and it just

53
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.470
worked there. There were no
drivers required cause they had

54
00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.630
included the drivers for this
express is express cam automatically.

55
00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.240
That's one of the biggest
features of windows is not

56
00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.850
having to worry about drivers
as far as know. Yeah.

57
00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.220
Concern for the big stuff
for the big middle of

58
00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.700
the bell curve stuff here.
Okay. Interestingly enough, that little

59
00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.760
$3 camera that I got
at Goodwill did not work

60
00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.290
on Vista RC three RC
one rather, excuse me. But

61
00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:16.440
the weird little no-name Taiwanese
has no official drivers think

62
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.420
eat $4 cam does work.
So something got a little

63
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.270
inverted. They're not quite sure
when you install Vista, the

64
00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.480
first time you can run
a compatibility check or you

65
00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.300
can go online, you can
download the compatibility check ahead

66
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.550
of time. I think this
is really cool because it

67
00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.130
gives you a checklist of
stuff that you ought to

68
00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.220
do before you do the
installation. So you run this

69
00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.430
adviser, this compatibility adviser, and
it says, you know, I

70
00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.220
really think you ought to
uninstalling Nero, which was my

71
00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.890
CD burning software. I love
you might want to think

72
00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.230
about narrows the bomb. I
was pretty bummed, but you

73
00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.010
remember that everything's changed from
a security standpoint and the

74
00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.760
driver model has changed. So
Nero seven did not work.

75
00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.030
I had done install it.
It said to install these

76
00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.410
couple of drivers, didn't warn
me about my obscure ergo

77
00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:09.750
decks. <inaudible> alternative keyboard told
me that would work awesome,

78
00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.860
but told me that my
Logitech quick cam express wouldn't.

79
00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.720
So that along with a
Wacom tablet, three removable hard

80
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.710
drives four or five USB
hubs. You know, my, my

81
00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.580
que cat scan, you know,
my scanner, my multifunction printer,

82
00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:29.340
some stuff worked and some
stuff didn't. Now I know

83
00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.650
that not everyone's going to
have, you know, roughly 15

84
00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.710
devices plugged into their machine,
but I've got a pretty

85
00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.940
wide spectrum of, of devices.
And I was surprised frankly,

86
00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.240
at the obscure ones that
did work and the fairly

87
00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.780
common ones that didn't. So
I would just say, take,

88
00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.630
you know, do your best
and realize that something's not

89
00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.780
gonna work at least with
RC one. So we've been

90
00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:55.140
discussing this on the regional
director mailing list for the

91
00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:57.920
last auto, no few weeks
ever RC one came out

92
00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.550
really. And you know, a
lot of our DS are

93
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.640
having similar problems and a
lot of people having problems

94
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.690
with drivers and Microsoft has
been coming back with some

95
00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.450
official answers. And one of
them resonated with me today,

96
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:16.460
which was that drivers, you
know, are the last thing,

97
00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.430
the last piece of the
puzzle to get put into

98
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:24.140
an O S before it
ships and the driver, the

99
00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:27.920
driver model is what Microsoft,
you know, they're the OSTP

100
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.170
side of the driver model
has to work. And then

101
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:33.140
apparently it does, you know,
the stuff that they've been

102
00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:37.670
testing it with has been
stock, you know, SVGA drivers,

103
00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:42.380
you know, not a lot
of fancy, fancy schmancy stuff

104
00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.790
Was like ATI though have
had the access to what's

105
00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:48.880
called the, you know, the
LDM, the Longhorn driver model

106
00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:50.720
for the better part of
a year. And you know,

107
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:52.930
those guys like at ATI
and Nvidia are always pumping

108
00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:56.140
out new drivers. So, you
know, if you're using an

109
00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:58.540
ATI or an Nvidia, which
are really the only two

110
00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.530
video cards, anyone bothers to
run anymore, you're probably doing

111
00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:05.860
okay. But interestingly enough, the
default out of the box,

112
00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:10.720
ATI drivers had allows you
to experience, but I did

113
00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:15.970
install the <inaudible> drivers from
ATI website directly. And I

114
00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:18.670
did notice a difference in
the smoothness of the, the

115
00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:22.630
glass effect. Yeah. But right
now, if I play my,

116
00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:27.940
my movies or DVDs or
any windows media player video

117
00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:31.660
on the secondary monitor, I
get four frames a second.

118
00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:33.850
If I move it over
to the primary monitor, I

119
00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:38.380
get a fluid 30 frames,
a second. Wow. ATI and

120
00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:41.260
Nvidia guys. Who've got their
hands full when they go

121
00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.990
to work in the morning,
just with just supporting XP.

122
00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.620
I mean their stuff, you
know, their mainstream stuff has

123
00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:51.940
been losing quality lately. Well,
it just gets so expensive.

124
00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:53.950
I mean, why would I
buy a $400 video card

125
00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:55.900
when I can buy an,
an Xbox three 60 for

126
00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:58.510
$400? Yeah. So, I mean,
I think that I have

127
00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:02.950
a 256 Meg radio on
9,800 pro. That was the

128
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:06.160
greatest video card that mankind
has ever known four years

129
00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:10.600
ago. And you know, and
I'm still occasionally in different

130
00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:13.600
applications like today and I,
and iTunes seven, I got

131
00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:17.410
a year out of a
video card, memory error, and

132
00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:21.370
interestingly in iTunes. Wow. I
don't think iTunes uses direct

133
00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:22.660
draw though. I don't know.
They don't use the new

134
00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:26.410
stuff in Vista. Interestingly though,
on my wife's a cheapo

135
00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.840
machine with an integrated video
card. And I think it

136
00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:32.590
has 64 megs of video
Ram. I got a video

137
00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:35.290
card out of memory error
when I tried to launch

138
00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:38.200
every single new game. Cause
all of the games and

139
00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:42.250
Vista have been rewritten to
use the new, the new

140
00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:47.380
WPF presentation stuff. So like
solitaire, spider solitaire. There's a

141
00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:50.260
great new chess game. I
mean, they really brought it

142
00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.870
out for the games. The,
the, the new games have

143
00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:55.650
been totally rewritten. So I
went and ran them all

144
00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:59.580
at once. Huh. Worked fine
on my big system. After

145
00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:02.490
two of them ran on,
on my wife's machine, it

146
00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:05.880
set out a video Ram
falling back to other renderer,

147
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:09.720
which I thought was interesting.
So, so how, how much

148
00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:13.770
does your big system have
video? Ram was 256 megs.

149
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:18.300
Is that what they're saying
is the minimum or I

150
00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:19.770
think that there's what depends
on what they're saying. The

151
00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:23.430
minimum is right. So for,
for glass, I believe the

152
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:27.840
minimum is 128. Okay. Because
my Toshiba M two Oh

153
00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:30.210
five has 64 megs of
shared Ram and it does

154
00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:32.970
not run the arrow experience.
So you don't get glass,

155
00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:36.120
you get what's called a
Vista basic, and there's a

156
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.900
couple of levels. There's like,
there's arrow, there's Vista basic.

157
00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.560
Then there's another basic, that's
one step down from that.

158
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:46.110
And then there's a windows
classic kind of the original.

159
00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:49.730
Now the best way to
find out about your system

160
00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:53.310
once you've installed Vista is
to go to the control

161
00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:57.090
panel and go under performance
information and tools. And you

162
00:09:57.090 --> 00:10:00.720
get this thing called the
WEEI, the windows experience index.

163
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:04.320
And this is basically an
index, which is the lowest

164
00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:09.990
value of your processor, memory
graphics, your gaming specific graphics

165
00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:13.200
and your hard drive. That's
the lowest sub score. So

166
00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:16.230
on my system, I have
an experience of 4.2 and

167
00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:20.790
apparently the current max is
5.9, but this is a

168
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:23.820
relative thing. So as new
bits of hardware come out,

169
00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:26.700
you're going to get bigger
and bigger numbers. But 5.9

170
00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:28.860
is a current max. So
for example, in my system,

171
00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:32.940
my hard drive, which is
a 7,200 RPM Stripe, I'm

172
00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:36.930
getting 5.7 on my memory,
which is two gigs. I'm

173
00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:39.450
getting memory operations per second.
I get a 4.8. Again,

174
00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:42.420
these are all kind of
average things. I get a

175
00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:45.480
5.7 for desktop performance, which
makes sense because I'm getting

176
00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:49.140
really great desktop performance. The
dragging is clean. The arrow

177
00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:52.230
experience is nice, but it's
a radio on 9,800. It's

178
00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:56.040
not a great gaming machine.
I get a 4.5. Now

179
00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:58.080
all of this is running
on a P three up

180
00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:01.230
to me, a P for
three gigahertz, which isn't the

181
00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:03.120
fastest machine out there right
now. So I got a

182
00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:07.530
4.2. Now my overall score
is a 4.2 because your

183
00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:12.480
system is only as fast
as the slowest part, right?

184
00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:14.220
You can put a really
awesome video card and a

185
00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:16.350
really crappy machine and still
not going to help things.

186
00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.840
So it's actually a pretty
clever thing. And then as

187
00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:21.810
you go to the game
section, they'll tell you that

188
00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:26.370
this game requires a minimum
windows experience index of two.

189
00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:30.480
So then you'll see these
experience indexes on games. And

190
00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.100
this will be a really
easy way for people to

191
00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:34.410
know whether or not something
will work on their system

192
00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:37.310
or not pretty cool. It
is pretty cool. It's it's

193
00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:39.120
they really got it, right.
It's very clever. And then

194
00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.710
they have a whole section
on how you can improve

195
00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:43.890
performance. Now there's a number
of really neat things in

196
00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:45.990
Vista that are kind of
underneath. Cause a lot of

197
00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:48.090
people are wondering, well, why
should I bother? Right? It's

198
00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:52.320
just, it's it's XP service
pack three. You kind of

199
00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.670
heard some people say, yeah,
I've heard that, but they've

200
00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:57.880
really changed some of the
internals. They've got this thing

201
00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:01.060
called super fetch. They've really
changed the prefetching stuff. If

202
00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:05.320
you're looking at your windows
prefetch folder, see windows slash

203
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:09.100
prefetch inside there, there's a
thing called layout dot INI

204
00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:12.610
that the loader is keeping
track of what files and

205
00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:15.190
what directories are being accessed
so that the defragment or

206
00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.680
can put those directories to
the faster part of the

207
00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:20.470
hard drive. Yeah. And the
dot PDF files are letting

208
00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:23.650
you know what DLLs are
getting loaded during the course

209
00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:26.230
of running an application. So
the next time it sees

210
00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:29.400
that application run, it can
load those DLLs Ahead of

211
00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:34.350
time. I really love this
feature. I've heard it described

212
00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:37.830
as you know, how many
people have a computer that

213
00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:41.010
gets slower and slower. The
more you use it and

214
00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:44.430
the promise of this. Anyway,
the idea of this super

215
00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:47.070
fetch is that the machine
will actually get faster. The

216
00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:50.130
more you use it, cause
it learns more. It learns

217
00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:54.180
what you're essentially loading. Yeah,
exactly. Exactly. But with super

218
00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:56.520
fetch, it's even more than
that, it tries to speed

219
00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:58.740
your machine up when you
log in. So it's actually

220
00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:02.430
going to say, well, he
always loads word and Excel

221
00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:04.830
when he logs in. So
I'm going to just preload

222
00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:08.790
those DLLs ahead of time.
So it's personalizing the loader

223
00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:10.950
for your system. Now, a
lot of people say you

224
00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:13.380
should go and delete that
folder. That's kind of a

225
00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:15.930
stupid thing to do because
it's just gonna basically reset

226
00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:18.600
your fetch data. And since
your fetch data is constantly

227
00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:22.530
changing anyway, it's arguably becoming
a customized for you As

228
00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:24.480
you go, but no more
reason to have four gigs

229
00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:27.570
of Ram Scott. Well, so
that's a really good point.

230
00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:30.120
So speaking of Ram, there's
a new thing called an

231
00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:33.090
EMD and external memory device,
which is a fancy way

232
00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:37.110
of using USB drives for
something other than moving files

233
00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:41.940
around. So you've heard of
ready boost. Yeah. Have you

234
00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:44.460
heard about this? Right. Think
this is really interesting. Yeah.

235
00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:48.720
So this has caused a
run And on USB discs

236
00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:53.550
because what ready boost is,
is it's basically saying the

237
00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:58.080
swap file. Isn't fast enough
for random access. And a

238
00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:59.430
lot of there's a lot
of arguments about this on

239
00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:02.490
the net, but people don't
realize that when your hard

240
00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:05.310
drive is fighting, you've got
that kind of like one

241
00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:07.620
needle. Like for example, imagine
if you had an old

242
00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:10.350
record, like a vinyl record
and you wanted to listen

243
00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:13.260
to two songs at once
the hat and the needle

244
00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.720
on that record can only
move back and forth so

245
00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:18.510
fast. And you're going to
get skipping. You're not going

246
00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:20.010
to get a great experience.
So there's a lot of

247
00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:23.520
contention. That's why windows starts
up so slow is because

248
00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:26.730
you've got, you know, 85
different programs that are all

249
00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:31.080
trying to start up and
struggle to get access to

250
00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:33.480
the disc. And that's why
a lot of services can

251
00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:36.720
be delayed in windows Vista.
So basically they'll defer them

252
00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:40.260
towards idle time. Cause you
don't need immediate support for

253
00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.750
infrared or you don't need
immediate support for whatever. So

254
00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:46.290
they defer those things. So
what ready boost does is

255
00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:49.950
it says one thing that
USB drives are good at

256
00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:53.540
that hard drives aren't is
really, really fast, random access

257
00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:57.320
to data, not sustained. Give
me this giant file access

258
00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:59.690
to data because you can
only get, you know, 17

259
00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:02.630
to 20 megs, a second
out of an average USB

260
00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:06.140
drive when you're doing sustained,
but they can give you,

261
00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:09.650
you know, three, four, five
megs, a second, totally random

262
00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:13.240
from any portion of the
memory. Yeah. Now you're talking

263
00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:16.960
about flash drives, not USB
hard drives. I apologize. You're

264
00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:20.800
absolutely right. USB flash drives.
Thank you for that correction.

265
00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:23.980
Yeah. So with ready boost,
you pop in any USB

266
00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:27.160
drive and the very first
time windows sees it, Vista

267
00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:28.750
sees it for the first
time. It will run some

268
00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:31.060
tests on it. And if
it sees that it's fast

269
00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:34.840
enough, it will say in
the autoplay dialogue that pops

270
00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:37.000
up, do you want to
enable this for ready boost?

271
00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:40.990
Then you can basically make
a custom prefetch folder and

272
00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:45.280
files on that system that
will load a part of

273
00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:47.920
these fetching things. You know,
the DLLs and the bits

274
00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:49.840
of information that need to
be loaded ahead of time

275
00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:52.930
to make your system more
responsive. It'll load that stuff

276
00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:56.440
onto the USB drive and
when it needs, it I'll

277
00:15:56.450 --> 00:16:00.280
go there first. So it's
basically like a faster, closer,

278
00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:04.540
more customized virtual memory for
the purposes of making the

279
00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:09.490
loader faster, right? We're not
expanding memory. This is not

280
00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:11.470
a way of saying here's
a really slow machine with

281
00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:13.960
512 megs. I'm going to
give it four gigs just

282
00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:16.480
by plugging in a flash
drive. But it is saying

283
00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:19.960
that this machine has small
amount of memory and a

284
00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:23.290
slow hard drive. What can
I put on that machine?

285
00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:26.050
That's kind of in between
memory and hard drive, that'll

286
00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:30.070
make the user experience faster,
right? And you can go

287
00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:32.830
in and get a Kingston
data. Traveler elite is a

288
00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:35.830
really good one. There's one
called a steno. That's really

289
00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:39.310
fast. And a couple others.
If you do a Google

290
00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:42.850
search for a fastest USB
drive, there's three or four

291
00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:45.580
that are fast enough. And
I've seen some really big

292
00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:48.220
ones out there too. Now
there's, they're getting pretty bad.

293
00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:50.770
I mean, they're getting bigger
than 16 gigs. I've seen

294
00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:54.340
eight, eight gigs, 16 gigs.
Have I seen, I'm trying

295
00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:56.890
to remember right Now. One
of the things that's tricky

296
00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:59.980
about these larger drives is
that they, they cheat a

297
00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:03.670
little bit first. They'll tell
you that this drive we'll

298
00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:06.520
do 17 megs a second,
but a lot of these

299
00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:10.360
newer drives are putting 128
megs of really fast flash

300
00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:15.370
and the rest slow. So
you don't get complete speed

301
00:17:15.370 --> 00:17:18.550
across the entire amount of
memory that's on the drive.

302
00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:21.460
So for some files, you'll
get a lot of speed

303
00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:24.100
and others you won't. So
make sure that you take

304
00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:27.640
a look at almost all
the big brands have an

305
00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:30.940
elite or an advanced version
and then the regular version.

306
00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:33.460
So there's the Kingston data
traveler that you can get

307
00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:36.640
for a gig for 15
bucks at fries. And then

308
00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:38.710
there's the data traveler elite.
That's going to cost you

309
00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:42.070
40 bucks and you can
only find it online, almost

310
00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:44.800
all of the USB drive
manufacturers. The big ones have

311
00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:49.150
these different versions that include
the full on a speed

312
00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:51.210
that you can get out
of a little drive like

313
00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:53.910
this. Okay. This has caused
a run on people to

314
00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:56.190
run on these drives. Everyone's
trying to get this stuff

315
00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:58.650
working to see, does it
really make your system faster?

316
00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:01.020
And the consensus is it
does make your, your, your

317
00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:05.970
system a lot faster, 15
to 20%. They're saying disc

318
00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:08.250
IO have regular kind of
using stuff, but you have

319
00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:10.050
to. It's one of those
things that it builds on,

320
00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:12.840
right? You load word once
it's slow, you run loaded

321
00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:17.820
against again. It's faster. Now,
interestingly, they're talking about building

322
00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:20.940
this Samsung, I guess is
building this into the drive

323
00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:24.210
itself with a thing called
ready drive, which is really

324
00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:26.460
clever. A lot of people
think it's stupid, but I

325
00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:29.310
think it's really very clever.
They're basically putting a big

326
00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:33.390
fat chunk of flash on
the hard drive itself. Huh?

327
00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:35.870
Now they're saying they only
want to put 128 megs

328
00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:37.860
or two 56 megs. But
I think we'll see pressure

329
00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:39.420
from folks to get at
least a gig or so

330
00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:42.420
on these drives. And, and
what's interesting about this is

331
00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:44.640
it's not the performance that
they're looking for. It's the

332
00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:47.340
battery life. Cause you think
about the contention. You think

333
00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:49.560
about how much time your
little laptop has to beat

334
00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:53.550
on that. Drive. If, if
you could get the most

335
00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:56.310
of what you're working on
coming out of the flash,

336
00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:59.970
you could spin down the
drive and they're saying, you

337
00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:03.750
can get 30, 45 minutes
of additional battery life out

338
00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:06.450
of your laptop because the
OSTP and kind of the

339
00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:09.210
basics are running off of
the flash and you're not

340
00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:11.100
having to swap around on
the drive. And I think

341
00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:14.880
that's really clever. That's pretty
Slack. Yeah. So that's an

342
00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:18.450
example of the kind of
under, you know, underlying stuff

343
00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:21.000
that's happening in Vista to
make, make the experience better.

344
00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.530
But those are subtle. I
mean, how do you tell

345
00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:25.860
your mom, Hey yeah, super
fresh ready drive and really

346
00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:28.980
boost are gonna make things
better. You know, basically you

347
00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:32.130
will say, Hey, I see
your machines kind of slow.

348
00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:34.290
You got an old Dell
laptop. Let me pop this

349
00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:36.480
one gig drive and it'll
get a little faster. You

350
00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:39.560
know, Scott's about it. Let's
talk About sleeping and hibernation.

351
00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:42.840
What's new there. And there's
a new thing. There's, you

352
00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:44.660
know, we used to have
standby and we had hibernation,

353
00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:48.920
right? Yeah. Everybody knows not
to use standby. Okay. Well,

354
00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:51.410
because standby would drain your
battery and then the machine

355
00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:54.800
would just die. And also
some weird things happen with

356
00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:58.220
drivers. When you load back
up, I I'm taking the

357
00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:02.240
advice of several regional directors
who said always use hibernate.

358
00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:07.280
Don't use standby. Cause we
I've. I've noticed strange things

359
00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:10.640
happening when I, when I
come back from standby. Well

360
00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:13.730
with the existing driver model
and XP, the drivers are

361
00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:16.880
actually allowed to say, no,
they're allowed to say no,

362
00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:18.620
I'm not going to let
you hibernate. I'm not gonna

363
00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:21.800
let you stand by. And
then you get into trouble

364
00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:24.860
because the drivers are to
support that directory directly. So

365
00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:27.710
in the new model, not
only does Vista take that

366
00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:29.990
ability away from the drivers,
but they introduced this notion

367
00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:34.820
of sleep and sleep as
a simultaneous standby plus hibernation.

368
00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:37.640
So we'll save the data
to Ram and we'll save

369
00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:40.940
it to talk to a
disc. So if your machine

370
00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:45.410
does lose its battery or
get turned off, it's it

371
00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:46.910
can still come out of
hibernation. So you get the

372
00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:49.660
best of both. You can
close the lid and get

373
00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:53.770
the standby style of, you
know, the Mac kind of

374
00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:55.840
closed the lid. Don't think
about it. You ever see

375
00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:57.880
a windows person closed the
lid. They never do that.

376
00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:59.530
They never just closed the
laptop and put it in

377
00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:01.720
their bag. I'm always jealous
of that. I see people

378
00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.880
in the airports with their
Macs, they just close them

379
00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.590
and they put the, and
I'm like, dude, you need

380
00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:07.290
to watch the flashing light
for 10 minutes. You don't

381
00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:10.290
know Afraid of starting a
fire actually with my laptop,

382
00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:13.860
I always kind of like
closed the lid and then

383
00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:15.600
just watch it. It's like
looking at the light on

384
00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:18.560
the inside of the refrigerator,
like, you know, watch and

385
00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:21.240
make sure that this thing
actually got completely hybrid. Those

386
00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:25.470
kinds of problems go away.
Well, that's good. Now, have

387
00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:29.670
you installed <inaudible> I have.
So did you put on

388
00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:32.490
when effects as well? The
new dotnet framework three. Oh,

389
00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:36.690
I have. So you have
card spaces. This is what

390
00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:39.060
we used to be called.
Info card is now called

391
00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:41.940
card spaces. Richard And I
talked to Kim Cameron about

392
00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:45.660
this a couple of months
ago, I think. Oh yeah.

393
00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:48.840
Isn't he a cool guy.
Very cool. Yeah. We don't

394
00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:51.150
want to have him Blog.
He's got a great blog.

395
00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:55.350
It's identity blog.com shrinks slash
<inaudible>. Yeah. He's come up

396
00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:59.940
with his laws of identity.
Fabulous. What's cool about Kim

397
00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:04.590
Cameron is that he realizes
that card spaces is not

398
00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:07.560
son of passport. Right? We
can't have this kind of

399
00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:10.320
passport thing again. The problem
with passport is that Microsoft

400
00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:12.930
was in charge of it.
The nice thing about card

401
00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:16.230
space is that it's based
on standards. It's XML is,

402
00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:19.110
you know, the public loves
angle brackets and it works

403
00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:23.880
without Microsoft software. It's a
great idea. And they're saying

404
00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:26.940
it may be the most
important thing since cryptography, which

405
00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:28.980
is a pretty bold statement,
right? I mean, you can't

406
00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:31.020
just come out and say,
this is the greatest thing

407
00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:35.280
since God talked to Moses
and expect and expect people

408
00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:38.610
to get in line. But
Kim Cameron has actually enabled

409
00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:42.630
his PHP based blog to
take info cards. So actually

410
00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:45.090
logged in and left comments
on his blog using my

411
00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:49.050
info card. Wow. So an
info card is basically client

412
00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:53.340
side certs with revocation and
the ability to have security

413
00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:57.780
token services for the masses,
right? I mean client-side certs

414
00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:00.660
have always existed, but not
in a format that was

415
00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:03.810
very easy to manage or
very comfortable. Right. And it

416
00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:06.630
wasn't very easy to integrate
into your, into your browser.

417
00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:10.200
One thing, One thing that
we clarified right away in

418
00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:14.700
that interview was that even
though it's info card, which

419
00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:17.130
makes you think that like
a credit card, like you're

420
00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:19.890
carrying a physical card, that's
just the name of the

421
00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:22.950
technology. It really doesn't have
anything to do per se,

422
00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:25.680
with a, with a card
or a fog or anything,

423
00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:30.810
although those things could be
used. So yeah, exactly. Future

424
00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:32.490
versions of info card will
allow you to have a

425
00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:37.530
fob as an additional bit
of authentication cause right? The

426
00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:40.290
strongest authentication is, is what
you know and what you

427
00:23:40.290 --> 00:23:46.430
have. Yeah. The RFID tags
that are built into your,

428
00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:50.300
my Prius remote control that
allow me to lock the

429
00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:53.330
door and, and start the
car with a push of

430
00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:57.860
a button. Aren't secure that
anyone can read those with

431
00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:01.210
the proper software and a
laptop. And they actually have

432
00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:05.000
in cases of people stealing
Prius's out of parking lots

433
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.820
by using laptops in RFID
readers. Nice. Well, there's a

434
00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:11.800
lot of concern about RFID.
We should do a talk

435
00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:14.170
about that. People are concerned
that you could use RFID

436
00:24:14.170 --> 00:24:17.770
to create bombs that would
target people, carrying specific RIA,

437
00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:21.580
RFID enabled passports, but that's
a whole other show Protocol

438
00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:23.440
that says, what's your code.
And then they give it

439
00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:26.680
to you. It's really not
secure at all. Well, with

440
00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:29.800
info card, something like an
RFID could be used potentially

441
00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:33.610
as a claim info card
allows you to say, I'm

442
00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:36.790
a website and I have
some specific bits of information

443
00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:39.250
that I require from you.
So you could say, I

444
00:24:39.250 --> 00:24:42.640
need your first name, your
surname and your email address.

445
00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:45.610
And then you could select
a card which is really

446
00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:49.780
just a, a certificate from
your store, from your, your

447
00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:54.010
card space store, right? Yeah.
We should be calling it

448
00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:57.580
card spaces. That's the new
name? Sorry. So you would

449
00:24:57.580 --> 00:25:00.700
select your info card from
your card space store and

450
00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:04.480
then send it to the,
to the site. In this

451
00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:06.910
case, Kim Cameron's web bloggers
who wanted it from me,

452
00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:10.900
he would then go to
the security token service check

453
00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:14.530
for revocation. And there's an
exchange and you can go

454
00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:16.780
up to his blog at
shrink stir slash <inaudible> and

455
00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:19.030
get the details about how
card space works. Yep. You

456
00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:21.100
can go and learn about
how to install card spaces

457
00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:24.430
at shrink stir slash IEC.
Currently I've got it on

458
00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:27.760
my, my windows XP machine.
Cause you can put on

459
00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:30.970
wind effects, which is the.net
framework three. Oh. And you

460
00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:34.210
can put on seven and
then you've got it. And

461
00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:36.760
of course you get it
automatically with Vista. And the

462
00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:39.700
nice thing about card spaces
is that your users are

463
00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:41.500
going to have this. This
is something that's going to

464
00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:45.040
push out as a high
priority, automatic update on windows

465
00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:48.610
update probably in November, sometime.
So people are going to

466
00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:51.160
get card spaces. And what's
cool about it is that

467
00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:54.610
you're going to see plugins
for Firefox. Mack is going

468
00:25:54.610 --> 00:25:57.040
to support this. This is
something that people are excited

469
00:25:57.040 --> 00:26:00.070
about that hasn't really had
nothing to do with Microsoft.

470
00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:04.660
This is about identity 2.0,
putting people in control, potentially

471
00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:08.350
just making, you know, fishing
and theft like that. So

472
00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:11.590
much more difficult, right? We
should do an entire show

473
00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:13.420
on card spaces. We can
talk about writing your own

474
00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:17.950
security, token service, self issued
cards. What happens if someone

475
00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:21.940
like visa comes out with
a, an info card service

476
00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:25.360
that you can actually get
info cards for free, it

477
00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:28.780
could be really game changing.
It's huge stuff. That's something

478
00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:31.600
that's built into the underlying
security infrastructure of Vista and

479
00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:33.730
is really exciting. We should,
and we should do another

480
00:26:33.730 --> 00:26:37.990
show. Something else that's cool
about Vista is the <inaudible>

481
00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:41.650
protected mode. They run <inaudible>
in a mode that is

482
00:26:41.650 --> 00:26:44.850
even lower than the user
that you're running as already

483
00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:48.330
is actually kind of useful
and annoying because as you're

484
00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:51.600
doing stuff in Vista, you'll
find buttons and icons that

485
00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:55.230
have a little windows shield
on them. So for example,

486
00:26:55.230 --> 00:27:00.390
I went into a iTunes
seven yesterday and wanted to

487
00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:03.660
deactivate my audible.com account. And
I noticed that the okay

488
00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:06.360
button on the deactivate dialogue
had a windows shield on

489
00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:08.520
it. Then I started realizing
that a bunch of the

490
00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:11.280
icons for installers, like stuff
I want to do install

491
00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:14.250
on my desktop, had this
little windows shield over it

492
00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:17.430
to each time you click
on those, you get the

493
00:27:17.610 --> 00:27:20.670
user access control, prompt. This
is the thing where you

494
00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:22.920
get the curtain of, you
know, the gray curtain of

495
00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:26.160
death that covers your desktop
and says, you need to,

496
00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:29.640
okay, this, this is meant
to warn you when folks

497
00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:33.810
do stuff like accessing directories
that they shouldn't, maybe you've

498
00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:35.520
got a Trojan on your
machine or some kind of

499
00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:38.520
attacker is trying to gain
access to a directory. One

500
00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:40.470
of these would pop up
and this would be your

501
00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:42.570
opportunity to say, no, I
don't want to allow that.

502
00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:44.880
Yeah, this is real similar
to what the Mac folks

503
00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:47.940
see when you're on OSX
and something tries to do

504
00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:51.000
something you'll get prompted to
enter your password. In this

505
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.950
case, you just click on
a button in a special

506
00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:56.790
modal mode. This is actually
a modal dialogue. That's system-wide

507
00:27:56.790 --> 00:28:01.860
mobile modal. Rather. It actually
takes over everything. So it's

508
00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:04.860
running in a different desktop.
It's an entirely different context.

509
00:28:05.210 --> 00:28:07.670
I guess the perfect virus
for Vista is the one

510
00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:11.510
that emulates that dialogue. Huh?
Yeah. That's a very interesting

511
00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:14.270
question. I know that I've
seen a number of websites

512
00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:16.820
that can simulate that, but
they can't cover the entire

513
00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:18.860
desktop. Of course. Yeah. It
would have to be a

514
00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:22.250
binary virus. I believe that
there are, there are controls

515
00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:25.670
to prevent that because what's
interesting about this, this modal

516
00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:29.270
dialogue is that it's running
in an entirely different desktop

517
00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:33.290
context. It's a whole other
user, basically like same thing

518
00:28:33.290 --> 00:28:36.770
happens when you're in card
space, that programs that are

519
00:28:36.770 --> 00:28:40.340
running in your desktop, can't
access this stuff. You can

520
00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:42.140
see it and you can
interact with it, but no

521
00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:46.610
one else can. Right now,
some of the stuff that

522
00:28:46.610 --> 00:28:48.740
my wife was excited about
is the family controls that

523
00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:50.780
are built into Vista. This
is really great stuff. This

524
00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:52.340
is kind of the stuff
that should have been built

525
00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:55.130
into XP in my opinion,
but it's finally available in

526
00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:57.470
Vista. This is where you
can actually go in and

527
00:28:57.590 --> 00:29:00.110
fill out a grid of
when Billy can use the

528
00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:03.170
computer, what programs he can
run, what he can't, what

529
00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:06.230
sites he can visit. You
can set time limits on

530
00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:09.500
your system. Wow. It's really
powerful stuff. So if you've

531
00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:13.700
got kids and you want
to control their access, I

532
00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:16.040
wouldn't be afraid to let
you know. Then the niece

533
00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:19.100
and nephew play with the
computer, you can lock their

534
00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:22.190
systems down, such that they
couldn't hurt themselves. Right. You

535
00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:24.180
know, you let the kids
play with the machine and

536
00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:26.090
you show up one day
in program files is in

537
00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:30.080
the recycle bin. How did
you do that? That kind

538
00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:32.480
of stuff doesn't happen on
Vista cause they really locked

539
00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:34.940
it. Yeah. I've recently had
to deal with this because

540
00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:38.660
my four year old has
recently taken a keen interest

541
00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:42.070
in playing video games. So
I, her her own XP

542
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:45.700
login, I have a running
as a user and I'm

543
00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:49.120
running as administrator. And what
I've done is I've just

544
00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:52.870
removed items from her start
menu, just, you know, remove

545
00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:57.850
control panel, remove that, remove
this, remove that. And, and

546
00:29:57.850 --> 00:30:00.520
also we keep the computer
that she uses in the

547
00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:03.340
living room. And so when
she's using it, we're in

548
00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:06.550
there with her, you know,
I think that's probably the

549
00:30:06.550 --> 00:30:09.760
first thing parents oughta try
to just, you know, spend

550
00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:12.990
a little more time with
your children. No, there's a

551
00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:14.880
number of yeah. Get them
off the computer as well

552
00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:17.490
Would be preachy, but you
know, sure. We'll do a

553
00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:20.010
show in the future on
running as a limited user,

554
00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:22.110
there's a number of ways
that you can do this

555
00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:25.530
in windows XP, where you
can basically lower your own

556
00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:29.910
abilities, give yourself less access
there's tools like privileged bar

557
00:30:29.910 --> 00:30:33.150
priv bar make me admin
and different tools like that.

558
00:30:33.150 --> 00:30:35.400
You can set it up.
So a dos prompt will

559
00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:37.980
turn red when you're an
administrator, we'll do a show

560
00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:40.410
on that on running as
limited a user. It's a

561
00:30:40.410 --> 00:30:42.870
really useful thing. A couple
of other things that are

562
00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:45.390
cool to check out on
Vista is they're really going

563
00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:48.420
full court, press on what
the, you know, the mysterious

564
00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:52.320
flash URLs. You can go
to see windows vista.com and

565
00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:55.890
that's one you can go
to innovate on windows vista.com.

566
00:30:55.890 --> 00:30:58.440
And those are strings stir
slash I E L N

567
00:30:58.470 --> 00:31:01.620
I E K respectively. They
got the guy, a guy

568
00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:03.690
from TV. I forget his
name. He used to be

569
00:31:03.690 --> 00:31:06.240
on a TV show called
picket fences. They got him

570
00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:09.210
to do a whole series
of videos where, you know,

571
00:31:09.450 --> 00:31:12.450
it's one of these kind
of older Tom Selleck mustache

572
00:31:12.450 --> 00:31:14.640
guy. I know that was
why he was in a

573
00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:17.670
river, runs through it. What's
that guy's name? Tom? What's

574
00:31:17.670 --> 00:31:20.820
his name? I don't know
somebody. Yeah. So that guy

575
00:31:20.850 --> 00:31:26.010
did a leaf commercials too.
Exactly. So, so that guy

576
00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:28.470
is telling you about Vista
and you know, have the

577
00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:30.960
kind of quiet confidence to
let you know that everything

578
00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:33.120
is going to be okay.
Yeah. Well, if you don't

579
00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:36.620
do it, I'm going to
scare it, Tom Skerritt. Right?

580
00:31:36.810 --> 00:31:39.240
So they got Tom Skerritt
going through the, this missile

581
00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:41.460
whole flash thing, but they
do give you an idea

582
00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:43.230
of really what's changed. I
mean, once you kind of

583
00:31:43.230 --> 00:31:45.450
cut through the cheese, yeah.
They can get an idea

584
00:31:45.450 --> 00:31:47.610
of what's changed now for
our developer audience, the folks

585
00:31:47.610 --> 00:31:49.470
who really want to see
what's changed, what's the best

586
00:31:49.470 --> 00:31:51.300
way to find out or
from my point of view,

587
00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:53.880
it's to see what's broken,
right? What did they break

588
00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:57.600
on purpose? So take a
look at the application compatibility

589
00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:00.300
stuff on Vista. This is
at shrink stir slash I

590
00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:03.600
E M. And this is
a list of the things

591
00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:07.140
that they've changed that will
affect your application in high,

592
00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:10.950
medium, and low priority with
details on, Oh, you know,

593
00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:13.500
we changed the way WM
paint works and you should

594
00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:16.290
know because of this, it's
that level of detail. And

595
00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:18.990
that provided me a lot
more value than things like

596
00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:22.590
Paul throws Vista site to
shrinks there slash IEG that

597
00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:24.960
just tells you what's new.
I want to know what's

598
00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:28.620
busted. What's fundamentally different because
for me, I can't use

599
00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:33.000
fine print. My, my favorite
printer driver, my, my multifunction

600
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.980
printer. I can't get it
to share even to other

601
00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:38.670
Vista machines. I can't get
my Wacom tablet to work.

602
00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:41.240
You know, these things aren't
killing me, but they are

603
00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:43.490
a little frustrating. And I'd
like to know why you

604
00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:46.130
can dig into that at
the a, in the MSDN

605
00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:49.250
library, finding out what they've
actually changed in Vista and

606
00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:52.360
get your apps ready to
work in Vista. Now Speaking

607
00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:55.930
about developer, the developer audience,
I've noticed a few things

608
00:32:56.110 --> 00:32:59.770
written down in your notes
here about the.net framework 3.0

609
00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:04.150
and windows workflow. Screencasts what's
what does that do? Yeah.

610
00:33:04.150 --> 00:33:06.520
You know, so Don had
framework three. Oh is on

611
00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:09.760
Vista by default. So you
get Indigo, right? The windows

612
00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:13.870
communication framework, right? You get
the windows presentation stuff. This

613
00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:16.390
is XAML right. We'll do
a show on XAML. Maybe

614
00:33:16.390 --> 00:33:18.480
we'll get some cells to
talk to us about, about

615
00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:20.680
that. Cause he's got a
book on that you've got,

616
00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:24.040
then you've got windows workflow.
So this is an in

617
00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:26.290
process workflow. I think we'll
do a whole show on

618
00:33:26.290 --> 00:33:27.910
that. Someone out there should
be keeping track of these

619
00:33:27.910 --> 00:33:30.850
shows. We'll do windows. Workflow
is really exciting. This is

620
00:33:30.850 --> 00:33:33.700
an in process workflow application
that allows you. It's basically

621
00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:37.150
like, you know, tiny BizTalk,
lets you describe in a

622
00:33:37.150 --> 00:33:40.330
very clean XML format, a
series of workflows and activities.

623
00:33:40.330 --> 00:33:43.720
You can write your own
activities and then bring this

624
00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:46.210
up inside your applications. You
can also do long running

625
00:33:46.210 --> 00:33:49.420
workflows. So someone could say,
send an email and then,

626
00:33:49.870 --> 00:33:52.780
you know, dehydrate this workflow
and wait for someone to

627
00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:54.790
come back and then we'll
start the workflow back up.

628
00:33:54.790 --> 00:33:58.810
Once they've approved something via
email, really cool stuff that's

629
00:33:58.810 --> 00:34:02.830
built in. You have that
automatically. And what's the shrink

630
00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:06.460
stir for those screencasts Ah,
yes. Sorry about that. So

631
00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:09.280
the windows workflow screencasts are
really nice there. It's shrink

632
00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:15.310
stir slash I E a
all that stuff's up@netfxthree.com. And

633
00:34:15.310 --> 00:34:19.150
this is the kind of
the.net framework three developers site

634
00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:21.550
that you should definitely take
a look at. I also

635
00:34:21.550 --> 00:34:25.150
want to mention that on
DNR TV, I did a

636
00:34:25.150 --> 00:34:29.380
whole four part series on
windows workflow foundation with Michael

637
00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:36.760
Stiefel. And you can see
episode1@shrinks.com slash IEP. Or you

638
00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:39.550
can go to DNR tv.com
and just go to the

639
00:34:39.550 --> 00:34:43.000
archives and check it out
this for, I think it's

640
00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:49.540
something almost five hours of
workflow, interview style videos. That's

641
00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:52.960
fantastic. I'm doing the DNR
TV stuff. Now a couple

642
00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:54.430
of people have been saying
that Vista is just a

643
00:34:54.430 --> 00:34:58.480
rip off of math Mac
OSX <inaudible> so if you

644
00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:00.160
think that's the case, take
a look at shrink stir

645
00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:03.880
slash I E J there's
a, basically a feature by

646
00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:06.370
feature comparison because some of
the new stuff in the

647
00:35:06.370 --> 00:35:10.210
next version of the Mac
iOS code named leopard, we'll

648
00:35:10.210 --> 00:35:12.040
let you go back in
time and do, you know,

649
00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:15.280
file versions. See the previous
version of a file, stuff

650
00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:19.840
like that exists in Invista
as well. You can actually

651
00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:22.270
look at a file and
say, I want to see

652
00:35:22.270 --> 00:35:26.290
previous versions of this. This
is actually pretty creepy. I

653
00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:29.440
just right. Clicked on my
notes for Hansel minutes and

654
00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:32.020
I hit properties. And this
was the same properties dialogue

655
00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:35.290
you used to seeing, except
this one says general security

656
00:35:35.290 --> 00:35:40.260
details. And then it says
previous these are saved automatically

657
00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:43.440
and I can see yesterday's
version and I can then

658
00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:46.590
open that version and go
back in time and then

659
00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:50.070
see what is in that
version. It's a little bizarre.

660
00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:52.920
I'm going to dig into
kind of the details where

661
00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:56.160
that stuff goes, but that's
basically hidden on my local

662
00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:59.640
hard drive in a special
folder with, you know, my

663
00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:03.660
name and a date timestamp
about when it was saved,

664
00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:05.940
the same kind of feature
is going to be in

665
00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:11.700
OSX. Basically they're they're squirreling
away versions of stuff as

666
00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:15.860
you go. You know, that,
that my reaction to that

667
00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:19.040
is a visceral reaction is,
Oh my God, you know,

668
00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:24.470
wasted this space, but no,
this space is become ridiculously

669
00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:28.460
cheap. I think I can
get a 320 gig hard

670
00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:33.680
drive. Now for 99 bucks,
320 gigs for 99 bucks.

671
00:36:34.130 --> 00:36:36.530
I was at office Depot
yesterday and just about bought

672
00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:40.520
the, the Western digital. My
book was $199 for half

673
00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:43.580
a terabyte, 500 gigs. Yeah,
I'm sick about it. I

674
00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:47.000
should've gone back, Use those
here to, to archive old

675
00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.720
versions of DNR and enhance
them and it's yeah, People

676
00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:53.120
will complain and they'll say
that, well, I want, you

677
00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:56.060
know, Vista to respect my
disc base and you can

678
00:36:56.060 --> 00:36:57.860
turn all these features off.
You can tell it that,

679
00:36:57.860 --> 00:36:59.420
but just to give you
an idea of how much

680
00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:03.800
Vista understands that disc space
is cheap, it actually takes

681
00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:07.910
your entire program files, documents,
and settings and windows folder

682
00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:11.210
and saves it off during
an upgrade. Wow. So if

683
00:37:11.210 --> 00:37:13.220
you want to uninstall this
day, it'll put it back

684
00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:16.820
exactly as you had it
before by bringing all those

685
00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:20.540
folders back exactly where they
were. So, you know, that

686
00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:21.800
was a little surprising to
me when I opened up

687
00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:23.900
my hard drive yesterday and
had only 10 gigs free

688
00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:25.850
on an 80 gig drive.
And then I realized that,

689
00:37:25.850 --> 00:37:28.340
you know, 16 gigs was
squirreled off into the, in

690
00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:30.560
the corner. It's crazy. If
you think about that, they're

691
00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:32.960
not that they don't do
that. They'd be crazy for

692
00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:35.510
not because how many times,
how many times have you

693
00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:38.660
seen, you've got a 200
gigs free on your hard

694
00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:42.530
drive or whatever, right. And
then, you know, you see

695
00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:45.410
this read me file or
a to do list from

696
00:37:45.410 --> 00:37:47.180
last month that had a
few phone numbers in it.

697
00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:49.580
You don't recognize and what
do you do? You delete

698
00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:54.590
it, right? You delete it.
And it's like, well you

699
00:37:54.590 --> 00:37:57.890
have 200 gigs free. There
may be that phone number

700
00:37:57.890 --> 00:37:59.900
that you may need to
go back time. You don't

701
00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:03.350
need it now, but why
are you deleting it? You

702
00:38:03.350 --> 00:38:05.450
know, one of the Things
that does bother me about

703
00:38:05.450 --> 00:38:07.370
this, and I think this
is just an ongoing issue

704
00:38:07.370 --> 00:38:10.370
about computers in general is
be aware of where your

705
00:38:10.370 --> 00:38:13.520
stuff is, right? The fact
that there are shadow copies

706
00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:16.460
now means that if you're
stupid enough to put your

707
00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:19.340
social security number in a
text file, that social security

708
00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:22.310
number exists in a number
of places now. Yeah. You

709
00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:24.200
know, it's being automatically backed
up or it's going here,

710
00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:27.380
it's going there. So let's
rattle off a couple of

711
00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:29.630
things that are built into
Vista that they don't do

712
00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:31.730
a good job of advertising.
I like the redesign of

713
00:38:31.730 --> 00:38:34.730
the start menu, but there's
so much stuff. Yeah. There's

714
00:38:34.730 --> 00:38:39.070
lots. The system, you know,
it's hidden and useful. For

715
00:38:39.070 --> 00:38:43.960
example, they've included, you know,
sticky notes and all the

716
00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:46.360
gadgets, you can have like
a sticky post it notes

717
00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:49.360
on the screen. They've got
a fantastic new windows, speech

718
00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:52.360
recognition engine that lets you
drive the entire OSB a

719
00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:56.050
voice wow. Hit, you know,
buried two levels deep down

720
00:38:56.050 --> 00:38:59.590
in accessories. They've got a
new snipping tool that lets

721
00:38:59.590 --> 00:39:01.840
you do screenshots by just
drawing where you want the

722
00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:04.480
screenshot. Cause all the tablet
P stuffs PC stuff's built

723
00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:07.390
in the new sync center,
the new windows sidebar, like

724
00:39:07.390 --> 00:39:10.180
we talked about the gadgets,
you've got a backup tool

725
00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:12.670
that's built in. Now you
can do complete system backups.

726
00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:15.730
There's a new thing called
windows, easy transfer that lets

727
00:39:15.730 --> 00:39:18.940
you install a clean version
of windows and then take

728
00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:21.040
another machine and hook the
two up and have your

729
00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:24.370
files and information move over
from the old machine for

730
00:39:24.370 --> 00:39:27.730
making upgrades. Just that much
easier. Wow. There's features to

731
00:39:27.730 --> 00:39:30.810
run internet Explorer with no
add-ons so you can, we

732
00:39:30.810 --> 00:39:36.180
run a clean I E
a window DVD maker, all

733
00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:38.040
this stuff is buried in
the menus and I don't

734
00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:40.080
know how they're going to
get that stuff really out

735
00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:42.630
so people can use it.
This is so much cool

736
00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:46.020
stuff going on, but there's
so much stuff going on.

737
00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:48.450
And I just don't, I
don't think that the start

738
00:39:48.450 --> 00:39:50.790
menu is doing a great
job of letting people know

739
00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:54.450
about this stuff. And there's
yet another program to search,

740
00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:56.580
to look at your, your
images. You've got the windows

741
00:39:56.580 --> 00:39:59.130
photo gallery. So it's going
to be a little confusing.

742
00:39:59.490 --> 00:40:02.520
Speaking of the start menu,
what, where did the start

743
00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:06.540
run go? So when you
click on the start menu,

744
00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:08.910
you now get a text
box right at the bottom

745
00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:12.990
that says enter search or
start search. That is the

746
00:40:12.990 --> 00:40:16.290
run dialogue. So what is
the search? It is the

747
00:40:16.290 --> 00:40:18.930
run as you start typing,
like if I type in

748
00:40:18.930 --> 00:40:22.050
calc and then just let
go of the keyboard, I

749
00:40:22.050 --> 00:40:24.990
see that the calculator pops
up. I see programs, calculator,

750
00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:28.530
files, everything that has calculator
in it. And then emails

751
00:40:28.530 --> 00:40:31.170
that have the word calculator
in it. Yeah. Or I

752
00:40:31.170 --> 00:40:33.420
could just hit enter and
it would work exactly as

753
00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:36.660
the start run menu would
have worked. One thing that's

754
00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:38.520
nice though, is because the
search is built in. You

755
00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:41.190
can save these searches. I
can go and say, search

756
00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:46.260
all, come into windows Explorer,
and then say, save search.

757
00:40:46.590 --> 00:40:50.220
And that'll appear as a
saved search with a dot

758
00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:52.860
search dash M S folder.
And I can tag that

759
00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:55.680
search and keep it in
my favorites. So basically you

760
00:40:55.680 --> 00:41:00.900
can make virtual folders that
are saved searches, right? If

761
00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:03.270
you have a project that
spans many folders, you want

762
00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:05.640
to say anything with Karl
Franklin's name in it. I

763
00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:07.830
want to have a virtual
folder that has all that

764
00:41:07.830 --> 00:41:10.380
stuff a lot. Like you
do search folders and outlook.

765
00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:12.480
Now this was going to
be part of when Fs

766
00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:15.930
wasn't it? Well, so when
Fs has gone, right, this

767
00:41:15.930 --> 00:41:19.290
was the metadata database and
is replaced with the windows

768
00:41:19.290 --> 00:41:23.250
desktop search component, which is
basically a, a more hardened

769
00:41:23.250 --> 00:41:27.630
built into the OS system-wide
search index. It's indexing server

770
00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:31.710
and windows, desktop search support
for eye filters built into

771
00:41:31.710 --> 00:41:34.640
the, to the OS and
turned on by default. All

772
00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:38.270
right. So it does give
us essentially the features that

773
00:41:38.270 --> 00:41:40.970
we were looking for and
when Fs, but, but isn't

774
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.360
architecturally the same, right? Yeah.
It gives you the same

775
00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:49.250
general experience. Exactly. Everything is
index that's constantly running and

776
00:41:49.250 --> 00:41:50.960
it allows you to do
different things like here I've

777
00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:53.840
clicked on my documents. I
can now go to views

778
00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:57.860
and I can say, I
want to view by sort

779
00:41:57.860 --> 00:41:59.660
by that stuff we're used
to, but I can also

780
00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:03.800
say stack by, I could
say stack by size. So

781
00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:07.310
now I'm going to get
virtual folders that say, here

782
00:42:07.310 --> 00:42:10.730
are all the files between
a Meg and 16 megs,

783
00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:13.580
and that's a virtual stack.
I can then go into

784
00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:15.860
that and see just those
files. And it is that

785
00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:19.700
indexing service that makes that
possible. Wow, cool. Very bottom

786
00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:23.270
multithreading one thing that you'll
notice right away is that

787
00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:26.630
they do everything they can
to make the UI responsive,

788
00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:29.600
to get you something right
off the bat. And then

789
00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:32.180
they'll go back later and
do things like updating the

790
00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:35.300
thumbnails and, you know, give
you an a, you know,

791
00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:39.560
you can scroll quickly. And
then as you stop, the,

792
00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:42.110
the thumbnails will start to
flow in to the system.

793
00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:45.770
There's nothing like writing multithreaded
apps in a managed code.

794
00:42:46.550 --> 00:42:49.160
There's just, you know, it's
so much easier than, than

795
00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:50.960
doing it. The, I don't
know if the, I don't

796
00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:53.360
think the Explorer is managed
code, but I would have

797
00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:56.090
to run process, explore and
check it out. But they're

798
00:42:56.090 --> 00:42:58.940
doing something right? Because it
is a, it is much

799
00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:02.090
more responsive moving around and
explore, but it's very confusing.

800
00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:04.940
They change the left hand
side. It's not just a

801
00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:08.750
folder tree hierarchy anymore. Oh,
Hey, did you see a

802
00:43:08.750 --> 00:43:12.350
one other totally unrelated thing
that they've got? And this

803
00:43:12.350 --> 00:43:13.790
is actually a little old,
but I thought it was

804
00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:16.640
cool. They've got SIM city,
the original SIM city that

805
00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:19.880
you can run inside your
browser. No kidding. You can

806
00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:23.660
get this and everything. You
can get shrink stir slash

807
00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:28.460
I E H. This is
up@electronicarts.com and it's basically the

808
00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:30.590
classic SIM city. The one
that we played in high

809
00:43:30.590 --> 00:43:33.170
school and junior high in
your browser, you do have

810
00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:35.630
to register, but it's, it's,
it's free and you can

811
00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:37.190
screw around with, it might
be fun for the kids.

812
00:43:37.490 --> 00:43:39.650
All right, Scott, that's a
show. Thank you very much

813
00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:43.040
for your insights on Vista.
Thank you. And we'll see

814
00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:44.900
you next week on Hansel
minutes.
