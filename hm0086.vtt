and Carl talk open source
licensing with act online president

10
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.760
Jonathan Zuck. Hi, this is
Carl Franklin and you're listening to

11
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.760
Hansel minutes from Hanselman it's
dot com. I'm here with

12
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.810
Scott Hanselman and his guest
Jonathan Zuck. Our good buddy.

13
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.090
Hey Jonathan, how are you?
Hey man. It's great to

14
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.740
be here. Hi Scott. How's
it gone? Well, I, what

15
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.030
are we talking about? Patent
technology patent law? Well, a

16
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.440
lot of people have been
asking that we do a

17
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.980
show on open source licensing
and a lot of people

18
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.170
have been emailing me with
questions. Like I've got some

19
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.790
software and I want to
put it out there in

20
00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.980
the world. So then I
started to do a little

21
00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.710
research and realized that this
was a way bigger topic

22
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.730
than I could handle myself.
And then I realized that

23
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.220
that our buddy Jonathan here
would be the best guy

24
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.250
to talk to us about
this. So Jonathan, tell, tell

25
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.590
us about the organization that
you work for and you

26
00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.180
know, what you did before
and what you do now.

27
00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.080
Sure. Well, most of my
professional history is as a

28
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.800
software developer, some commercial software,
but a lot of custom

29
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.550
software built for large government
agencies and big companies like

30
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.930
American express and Freddie Mac.
But the last few years

31
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.870
I've been involved in an
organization called the association for

32
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:20.090
competitive technology, which is an
it industry trade association based

33
00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.910
in Washington. And now also
in Brussels, they kind of

34
00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.490
fights for the rights of
small businesses in the public

35
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.390
policy arena. So I've, I've
gone from programming to being

36
00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:35.320
a defender of programmers. Okay.
So gosh, why, what, what,

37
00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.790
what caused you to like
get into the whole DC

38
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.170
thing? I assume you have
to put on a suit

39
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.210
and go to Capitol Hill.
I know it's kind of

40
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:45.290
funny. I've been in Washington
since graduate school in 1987

41
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.890
and, and regarded for many
years, the, the white house

42
00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.440
and the Capitol building is
just part of the Smithsonian,

43
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.660
right? You know, the Capitol
building was this place with

44
00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.060
a dome that if you
stood on opposite ends of

45
00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.310
it, you could hear each
other whisper. And, and if

46
00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.970
you got a special pass,
you could go see, you

47
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.550
know, statesman debating about stuff.
And none of it had

48
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.930
any relevance to our day
to day lives, especially, you

49
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.070
know, entrepreneurs in the tech
field, but increasingly the decisions

50
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.440
that are being made in
Washington and Brussels and around

51
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.410
the world are starting to
have a real impact on

52
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.700
businesses, large and small in
the technology sector. And so

53
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.170
I thought it was time
to be a part of

54
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.880
having an impact beyond just
my own business. You started

55
00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.410
teaching the lawmakers about things
that they clearly knew, nothing

56
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.470
about when they, when they
were it, especially when Microsoft

57
00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.900
was in hot water the
first time. And they would

58
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.320
get up in front of
juries and try to be

59
00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.810
technical. And they really had
no idea what they were

60
00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.770
saying. So you, And so
if you think about it,

61
00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.290
laws are mostly made by
people that are having to

62
00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.260
deal with all kinds of
different issues. So, you know,

63
00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.370
they've, they've just had a
meeting about labor statistics and

64
00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.410
then suddenly you come in
to talk to them about

65
00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.010
some sort of technology policy
and it's enough to make

66
00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.560
your head explode. I'm sure.
But for the most part,

67
00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.530
we're talking about people that
have just about managed agricultural

68
00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.880
policy. So the talk about,
you know, web browsers and

69
00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.770
service-based architectures and the implications
for cross border commerce, for

70
00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:22.830
example, it's a tall order
to get them to understand

71
00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.090
it. So my, my gift
of precipitous and persistence and

72
00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.900
metaphor I suppose, has served
me well in communicating with

73
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.750
people whose day to day
jobs don't involve technology, Just

74
00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.590
out of curiosity, are there
any Congressman or us Congressman

75
00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.050
and your senators that, that
are technical, or like maybe,

76
00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.900
you know, closet geeks that
we don't know about? Have

77
00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.480
you met any that are
like that you surprised you

78
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.520
and immediately start talking tech
and you realize that this

79
00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.230
guy is running his own
home server and he's got

80
00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.080
his whole house wired. Isn't
David Rockefeller kind of A

81
00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.720
geek. Yeah. There's certainly a
number of hidden geeks on

82
00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.600
Capitol Hill. There's no question.
I mean, there are entrepreneurs

83
00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.380
who like me have built
businesses and then have decided

84
00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.670
to go on to try
and impact something beyond their

85
00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:09.090
own customer base. I mean,
Daryl Eissa, for example, is

86
00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:13.500
the inventor of the Viper
car alarm system, right? And,

87
00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.830
and so he comes to
the Congress with a real

88
00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.370
technology and engineering background and
gets these issues very quickly.

89
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:22.980
And then there's other people
that just sort of naturally

90
00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.000
think along those lines and,
and are just early adopters

91
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.910
of technology and are excited
by the benefits it can

92
00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:34.230
bring to, you know, their
websites and their campaigns, et

93
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:38.100
cetera. And that early involvement
mainly by younger members of

94
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.920
Congress makes them a little
bit more technology savvy up

95
00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:44.490
front. How much are you
involved in an open source

96
00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.210
licensing? And as it relates
to companies deciding to open

97
00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:51.720
source something or possibly defending
themselves against an open source

98
00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.060
thing, I mean, it's kind
of a broad question, but

99
00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:56.820
a lot of people want
to get software out there,

100
00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:58.460
but at the same time
they want To kind of

101
00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.380
put their thumb on it,
like a chess piece, just

102
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:01.670
in case they want to
do something with it in

103
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:05.170
the future. I mean, I
think that's, I think that's

104
00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:07.510
probably a good categorization of
the place that a lot

105
00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:10.630
of entrepreneurs find themselves. You
know, a lot of the

106
00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:14.890
work of act has to
do with public policy and

107
00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:19.420
the laws surrounding the technology
industry, but the whole, there's

108
00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:23.020
a whole different side, if
you will, to the industry,

109
00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.450
which is sort of how
it exists with itself and

110
00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:28.960
the kinds of agreements and
contracts that exist between industry

111
00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.340
partners and with between innovators
and their customers. And it's

112
00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:36.580
certainly nothing new. I mean,
all three of us are

113
00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:39.910
old enough to have created
shareware, for example, which was

114
00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:45.610
another type of license for
your, your software. I mean,

115
00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:48.190
I remember getting a game
once and he created a

116
00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:52.030
license. He called smile aware
where all he asked in

117
00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:53.980
return for his software was
that you send them a

118
00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:56.890
postcard saying how much you
enjoyed it. So, I mean,

119
00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:00.190
a lot of creative licensing
is certainly not a new

120
00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:05.350
concept. I got a postcard
from my share where I

121
00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:08.440
share where I think different
people had mixed success with

122
00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:12.280
that in some ways I
think share where the degree

123
00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.490
which share were enjoyed some
success back in the late

124
00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:18.400
eighties and early nineties was
actually a function of the

125
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:23.080
work done by organizations like
the business software Alliance and

126
00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:28.030
the software publishers association to,
to do sort of like

127
00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:31.630
a software audits inside of
large organizations. I remember I

128
00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:37.390
created a, a little utility
for printing your screen to

129
00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:41.170
laser jet and an Epson
printers. It was sort of

130
00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:44.620
like graphics.com, but with better
printer support. And I put

131
00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:46.120
it up there and I
said, well, if you like,

132
00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:49.930
it send $5, right. And
10,000 people downloaded it. And

133
00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:53.500
I would say that maybe
15 people said $5, right.

134
00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:56.680
And it made me wonder
that maybe I should've put

135
00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:00.070
this software out under a
different license, but what saved

136
00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:04.180
the day was that Merrill
Lynch called and Merrill Lynch

137
00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:06.670
had probably just been through
or had a colleague just

138
00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:09.190
be through a, you know,
a big time software audit.

139
00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:11.410
And so their question was,
we want to pay for

140
00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:12.910
this and we want to
know what it costs for

141
00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:15.850
an organization wide license. So
I would just throw out

142
00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:18.520
a number like, well, $5,000
and they'd be like, okay.

143
00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.870
And I'm like per department.
I meant, you know, and

144
00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:25.300
so you end up with
those kinds of negotiations that

145
00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:27.160
are a function of working
in a world in which

146
00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:31.090
large businesses are creating legal
precedents that we all benefit

147
00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:34.300
from because otherwise the shareware
model had some, some critical

148
00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:41.080
flaws. I think today with
the, this sort of resurgence

149
00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:45.040
and formalization of you will
of, of, of a concept

150
00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:50.380
of free and open source
software and how this religion

151
00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:55.150
has sort of commingled with
some industry players that have

152
00:08:55.470 --> 00:09:00.150
benefits to investing has created
a lot more visibility for

153
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:04.740
alternatives to commercial licensing, right?
So those alternatives have always

154
00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:07.110
existed, but I think now
they're getting a lot more

155
00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:09.780
attention. And so people are
looking at trying to figure

156
00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:12.600
out how they can ride
this wave, how they can

157
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.450
gain the benefits of a
lot of people looking at

158
00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:20.100
their source code, for example,
or the wide distribution associated

159
00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:23.250
with making their software free
and maybe gaining their benefits

160
00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:25.830
elsewhere. And so I think
that's why Scott's getting more

161
00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:28.140
and more of these questions
about, well, if I want

162
00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:29.640
to put out a piece
of software, what sort of

163
00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:32.750
license should I use? It
seems like there's a couple

164
00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:34.730
of different categories of this
kind of thing. I mean,

165
00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:37.730
there's the, I want credit
for having done it, but

166
00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:39.650
as far as, other than
that, you know, just keep

167
00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:42.200
my name in the source
somewhere so that people know

168
00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:46.550
I did it. And then
there's the, this is for

169
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:49.340
reference, right? Like the new
reference license and Microsoft Scott,

170
00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:50.780
where you can look at
the code, but you really

171
00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:52.580
can't do anything with it
other than use it as

172
00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:55.880
a learning tool. What are
some of the major categories

173
00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:59.240
of open source licensing software
cause opensource licenses rather cause

174
00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:02.240
there's hundreds of different licenses,
right? Yeah, sure. There's an

175
00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:05.390
organization in fact called the
open source initiative or OSI

176
00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:08.840
that has attempt to compile
all of these different open

177
00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:12.980
source licenses. And they've attempted
to bless licenses that can

178
00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:15.890
call themselves open source. And
in some respects, I think

179
00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:20.660
that's far less important to
the typical entrepreneur or innovator

180
00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:24.140
that it, that they're licensed
be blessed by some organization

181
00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:27.050
then that it meet their
needs. Right. And everybody has

182
00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:31.190
sort of individual needs for
a particular software license that

183
00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:33.710
they might offer their product
under. If you think about

184
00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:36.470
software licensing, it's, it's kind
of a continuum, you know,

185
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:40.160
on, on the one side
is the public domain license

186
00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:43.520
that basically says that I
want to make this software

187
00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.760
available to the world, to
the community. And I don't

188
00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:49.700
want anything in return and
I don't want any responsibility

189
00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:51.500
for it either, but it's
just free to use any

190
00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.750
way that you want to
use it. And on the

191
00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:56.600
other side of the continuum
is a typical commercial software

192
00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:00.230
license that can be very
specific about how the software

193
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:02.360
can be used. And then
the under the conditions at

194
00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.490
which they have to give
the software back, et cetera,

195
00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:08.810
there's even been provisions in
end user license agreements that

196
00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:11.930
specify that the software can't
be used for illegal activity,

197
00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:14.810
for example. So there's a,
you know, on a commercial

198
00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:16.910
license and a full blown
commercial license, there can be

199
00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:20.630
an awful lot of requirements
and specifications as to how

200
00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:23.660
that software can be used.
And then along that continuum,

201
00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:27.200
there's a lot of different
choices and categories of licenses

202
00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:30.290
that have to do with
what kind of limits you

203
00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:32.450
want to place on the
use of the software or

204
00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:35.210
what kind of rights you
want to retain for the

205
00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:38.660
software that you created. So
if you think starting again

206
00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:40.850
from the left to the
next soft, you know, a

207
00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:44.420
little bit more restrictive licenses,
the Berkeley software license that

208
00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:46.010
you hear from a lot
of people, the so called

209
00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:49.280
BSD license, and that license
has mostly to do with

210
00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:53.320
releasing your software out for
any purpose, but you really

211
00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:57.550
want limited liability associated with
the use of that software.

212
00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:59.860
So what you're saying to
people is, Hey, you can

213
00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:02.440
use this software any way
you like, but I take

214
00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:05.230
no responsibility for the software
or how you use it.

215
00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:08.230
Don't call me, right? So
if you build this software,

216
00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:12.310
that's for a cruise missile
guidance systems and it knocks

217
00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:15.880
off somebody's grandma's house, it's
not your responsibility, right? It's

218
00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:17.920
gotta be the responsibility of
the person who made use

219
00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:20.220
of the software. And just
by virtue of the fact

220
00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:22.580
that you put that license
in the, in the, in

221
00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:25.110
a licensed dot text file,
but by them using it,

222
00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:28.110
they have a kind of
implicitly accepted that license. That's

223
00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:30.900
exactly right by them using
that source code. You're saying,

224
00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:34.230
if you don't agree to
assume full liability for the

225
00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:36.660
use of this source code,
then you're not allowed to

226
00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:39.000
use it. So in other
words, if they don't agree

227
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.370
to that level of viability,
then they are not allowed

228
00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:44.970
to use that source code
from you. And so the,

229
00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:46.920
the next license over and
the one that's gotten a

230
00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:50.940
lot of publicity in recent
years is something called the

231
00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:55.620
general public license and or
GPL. And that came out

232
00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:58.800
of the free software foundation.
And that license has a

233
00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:03.660
particular purpose, which is to,
in a somewhat viral fashion,

234
00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:08.490
expand the base of freely
available software. So while that

235
00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:12.660
software is freely available for
use, there's some restrictions that

236
00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:16.290
have to do with, once
you use this software, what

237
00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:20.040
you have to do with
your modifications, to the software

238
00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:24.420
that you have to give
back your modifications back into

239
00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:28.410
this sort of communal system
of software that's built up

240
00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:32.040
around this license. So that
particular license is one that

241
00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:35.040
very heavily makes use of
your copyright that says that

242
00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:37.830
this is still my software.
I still own the rights

243
00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:40.260
to it. And that I'm
giving you the ability to

244
00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.890
use the source code in
your own products, but with

245
00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:49.020
the provisional that you will
give back any modifications you

246
00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:51.270
make to the software so
that I can improve my

247
00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:55.740
software, the community can make
use of those modifications. So

248
00:13:55.760 --> 00:14:00.630
it's a license that is
designed by a community as

249
00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:02.940
opposed to an individual vendor.
And I think that's one

250
00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:05.820
of the things that distinguishes
it is it's a license

251
00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:09.510
that's designed to build up
the resources of a community

252
00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:13.500
rather than specifically address the
interest of a software builder.

253
00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:16.170
You know, initially that sounds
like such a great idea,

254
00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:18.000
but one of the things
that we got in trouble

255
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.580
with, because our Lord, I
guess our lawyers didn't understand

256
00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:22.620
it. Maybe you can answer
this is that let's say

257
00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:26.640
that I'm using a testing
framework, that's GPL and I'm

258
00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:29.730
testing software that I don't
want GPL, but they've, they've

259
00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:31.650
become linked. Right? And this
is where we get into

260
00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:35.610
that technical versus legal I've
gone and said using the.net.net

261
00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:38.880
ism add reference. And now,
you know, in memory, these

262
00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:41.730
things are linked, but on
disc, they're not, you know,

263
00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:44.760
it has that virus quote,
unquote, spread into my software.

264
00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:47.070
Do I have to now
give away the thing that

265
00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:49.890
I'm testing? Right. And I,
and I think that that's

266
00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:53.810
the, I think that's one
of the issues. And in

267
00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:56.360
fact, that is the reason
that they developed something called

268
00:14:56.360 --> 00:15:03.230
the lightweight GPR LGPL was
to facilitate the coexistence of

269
00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:07.340
GPL and non GPL software.
If that software wasn't specifically

270
00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:13.160
integrated. In other words, if
you redistribute a piece of

271
00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:17.060
software in which you have
incorporated actual source code from

272
00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:21.800
a GPL, you know, code
base, then your code essentially

273
00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:25.700
becomes GPL source code, but
you do have the ability

274
00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:28.280
to kind of mix things
at a DLL level and

275
00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:32.690
allow to create software that
interacts with GPL software without

276
00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:35.380
taking on the viral nature
of that license. So that

277
00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:38.050
limp, that L that limited
could also mean library that's

278
00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:42.970
right. Okay. The library, the
library GPL. Exactly. And then

279
00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:49.060
the, and then the other
license that's becoming popular in

280
00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:53.410
the commercial space is so-called
reference or shared source license,

281
00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:58.630
which is designed by commercial
software vendors to get it,

282
00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:01.360
some of the advantages that
are enjoyed by the availability

283
00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:04.120
of source code without really
releasing any of their rights.

284
00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.790
In other words, in unreal,
licensed like that, you have

285
00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:09.880
the ability to look at
source code. You have the

286
00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:13.990
ability to incorporate the source
code into your debugging process.

287
00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:17.590
For example, you're allowed to
use the source code to

288
00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:21.910
create software that better inter-operates
with this existing software, but

289
00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:24.580
you haven't been granted any
rights to modify the source

290
00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:27.460
code or to redistribute it
under your own name, for

291
00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:30.310
example, the way that you
can under a GPL license.

292
00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:34.510
So that's still really largely
a commercial software license, but

293
00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:37.090
the source has been opened
up in such a way

294
00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:39.250
that it's made available for
your viewing and to be

295
00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:42.040
helpful to you, but it's
not designed to allow you

296
00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:47.140
to create a competitive product
and, and redistribute that under

297
00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:50.230
your own name. And so,
as you start further down

298
00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:54.430
that continuum, it becomes more
about your own intellectual property

299
00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:58.090
and your ability to protect
how that software gets used

300
00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.940
downstream. And that's what you're
getting into when you get

301
00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:03.820
into a real commercial license.
And one of the licenses

302
00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:05.680
that you haven't mentioned yet
that I see more and

303
00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:07.960
more, and perhaps it's more
of a media license, but

304
00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.300
I'm seeing it in source
as well. This is creative

305
00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:15.520
commons. That's exactly right. Lawrence
Lessig saw a lot of

306
00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.920
the same phenomenon. A lot
of the questions that you're

307
00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:20.710
asking or that you're saying,
people are asking you about

308
00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:25.030
how they should release their
software have been asked in

309
00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:27.280
the creative community for a
long time. In other words,

310
00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:29.860
if I'm an author or
musician, and I want to

311
00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:35.380
make my music available for
nonprofits, for example, for free,

312
00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:37.840
but I want for people
that are making money off

313
00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:40.480
the music to have to
pay me, or I want

314
00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:44.740
to make my music available
to anybody to listen to,

315
00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:46.870
but I don't want them
to be able to modify

316
00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:49.440
it and make it into
their own music, et cetera.

317
00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:52.380
So there's all these different
sort of permutations of what

318
00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:55.200
people would like to do
to more creatively get their

319
00:17:55.200 --> 00:18:00.720
own content out, you know,
to the public. And, you

320
00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:03.120
know, historically you've had to
go through publishers, either music,

321
00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:05.970
publishers or book publishers. And
so Laurence Les had created

322
00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:09.030
something called the creative commons,
which is really a set

323
00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:13.410
of licenses designed for artists
to kind of specify in

324
00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:15.870
some detail, well, this is
okay, but this isn't, and

325
00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:18.450
this is okay, but this
isn't. So that rather than

326
00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:22.170
having to just go with
one specific type of commercial

327
00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:25.410
CD based license, you again,
have a continuum of artistic

328
00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:28.380
licenses that are made available
to you in, in, in

329
00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:31.410
relatively layman's terms. So that
as an artist, you can

330
00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:35.450
put out content in a
number of different ways. No,

331
00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:38.180
I actually licensed the content
of my blog under the,

332
00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:41.150
I think it's the creative
commons, attribution license. And then

333
00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:44.340
the, the, the sample code
kind of, I assume that

334
00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:46.400
that's a good question. I
assume falls within that when

335
00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:49.100
I paste code that I,
you know, samples and snippets

336
00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:51.650
within that, the entire blog
and all of the things

337
00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:55.040
found within or under that,
that attribution license, which says

338
00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:58.130
use it, not for commercial
things, but a, you know,

339
00:18:58.190 --> 00:18:59.900
link back to me and
make sure that people know

340
00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:03.050
that it came from me.
I think that's exactly right.

341
00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:07.430
I mean, those licenses allow
you to specify how you

342
00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:10.220
want things that you've written
to be attributed to you

343
00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:14.030
and allow you with some
fine detail basically to say

344
00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:16.490
what's okay, and what isn't
okay. And it's meant to

345
00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:19.580
be empowering for artists, as
opposed to them just selling

346
00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:22.220
their rights over to a
publisher, and then having them

347
00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:24.920
define how that content gets
out to the market. I

348
00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:28.040
think creative comments has been
a really exciting project. Now,

349
00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:30.470
how much are these just
things that people, you know,

350
00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:32.270
kind of stamp on a
project and it makes them

351
00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:35.930
feel good versus something that
they could really have backing

352
00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:37.550
them up in court. I
mean, have these things been

353
00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:41.720
challenged? Well, I mean, there
are challenges that take place

354
00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:46.010
over licenses all the time.
I mean, for example, the

355
00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:49.910
free software foundation has had
legal action against a TiVo,

356
00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:53.810
for example, because what triggers
the viral nature of the

357
00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:58.340
GPL is the notion of
re redistribution of source code.

358
00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:03.350
In other words, if I
get a copy of open

359
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:07.220
office and I modify it
to create the world's best

360
00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:10.220
word processing program that I'm
going to use inside of

361
00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:13.910
a big bank that I
work for, for example, I

362
00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:17.750
don't have to give anything
to anybody where that viral

363
00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:20.450
license comes into play is
if I then turn around

364
00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:23.600
and decide that I'm going
to ship the, you know,

365
00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:25.280
I'm trying to come up
with a name that isn't

366
00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:28.910
a real bank, you know,
the lampshade bank, you know,

367
00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:34.520
office suite. Then at that
moment, that distribution triggers that

368
00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:37.820
viral requirement that I then
give all those modifications back

369
00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:42.440
into the public. And so,
you know, TiVo had a,

370
00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:47.230
an interesting problem where they
weren't distributing a, a version

371
00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:50.080
of Linux as a commercial
product, but they were distributing

372
00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:53.200
a product that used a
modified version of Linux. And

373
00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:55.930
there was certainly a legal
battle surrounding whether that represented

374
00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:59.830
redistribution, et cetera. So there
are fights that take place

375
00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:03.580
in the marketplace that helped
to define the legality and

376
00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:06.910
enforceability of these agreements. But
for the most part, they're

377
00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:12.070
quite enforceable. If you accept
content or software under a

378
00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:14.280
particular license, then you're bound
by that license. How are

379
00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:16.710
these things different than patent
disputes? I know Vontage is

380
00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:18.960
in trouble right now. I
think with sprint or Verizon,

381
00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:21.630
one of those guys may
be both. What is the

382
00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:25.050
difference between a patent dispute
and a licensing dispute License

383
00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:28.950
is actually a contract between
two parties. In other words,

384
00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:31.800
you're, you're basically I'm putting
in software at under a

385
00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:34.800
particular license. And as a
customer, you're saying that I'll

386
00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:37.770
use, I'm gonna use the
software and, and in, so

387
00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:43.500
doing I'm I'm in inferring
that you can, this license

388
00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:45.810
will be enforceable, right? So
it represents a kind of

389
00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:49.320
contract. A patent is something
a little bit more complex,

390
00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:52.950
and that's basically a government
sanctioned or a government sanctioned

391
00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:57.630
monopoly over a particular technology
that says that I've registered

392
00:21:57.630 --> 00:21:59.880
this invention. I was the
first to invent this and

393
00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:04.530
nobody else can do anything
exactly like this. And that's,

394
00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:06.870
and that's a little more
complicated because then you sort

395
00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:09.960
of have to go back
through the government to see

396
00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:12.990
whether or not that gets
enforced. It's not something that

397
00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:15.390
you sort of enforced directly
the way that you do

398
00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:18.830
with a license or a,
you know, a contract. Then

399
00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:20.700
if I license, if I
put a license on something,

400
00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:22.410
if I come up with
a new algorithm, I license

401
00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:25.860
it, creative commons, a bunch
of people use it. And

402
00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:27.690
then a year later we
find out that it was

403
00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:30.900
patented 10 years before, but
a bunch of people found

404
00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:34.350
it for me and used
my license. Then what, well,

405
00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:38.580
It's a, it's complicated because
you're actually licensing something different

406
00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:43.050
than they were patenting. They
they're ultimately patenting the underlying

407
00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:48.540
algorithm, the ultimate the idea
or invention behind the process

408
00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:52.470
that you have in fact
implemented via source code, your

409
00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:56.130
license was for your implementation.
In other words, if I

410
00:22:56.130 --> 00:22:59.580
read in, you know, a
scientific journal, you know, about

411
00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:04.050
a new, quick sort process
or something like that, we

412
00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:07.710
can both implement it. You
know, in our own code

413
00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:10.200
provided we're not violating a
patent and we could both

414
00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:15.120
license our implementations of that
invention. So I would have

415
00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:19.200
this licensing revenue associated with
my implementation and a patent

416
00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:21.720
holder. If you really did
violate a patent, then come

417
00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:24.810
to you and say, well,
you, you have your license

418
00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:27.000
revenue, but you should have
been paying me royalties for

419
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.910
my invention as part of
the product that you were

420
00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:33.810
licensing. And that's exactly what
happened to Microsoft in the

421
00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:38.160
context of Viola's in their
browser and Alcatel with the

422
00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:43.920
MP3 format. So there are
issues where by, it's not

423
00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:47.090
a question of your license
superseded by a patent, but

424
00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:50.060
that any revenues you generate
through that license could be

425
00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:54.260
subject to some kind of
royalty payments to the inventor

426
00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:59.090
of the underlying, you know,
invention that you implemented via

427
00:23:59.090 --> 00:24:03.460
source code. Jonathan, I'm always
interested in people's thoughts on

428
00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:08.380
pricing, because prices is sort
of the, the, how you,

429
00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:10.510
how you can you say
it, the, the lifeblood of

430
00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:14.620
any economy and sort of
everything, everything in money and

431
00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:17.290
everything in the economy comes
down to pricing. And I

432
00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:21.190
find it very difficult as
a developer of software. When

433
00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:23.710
I've tried to do this
to, to figure out what

434
00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:27.040
software is worth, how do
I price it? I mean,

435
00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:29.280
it all comes down to
the L the, the, the

436
00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:31.990
price in the license. We,
you know, within the confines

437
00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:36.730
of the license, but, you
know, I I'll often find

438
00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:39.340
that people will price software
according to how long it

439
00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:43.540
took them to develop it,
or, you know, what they

440
00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:48.130
think it's worth in terms
of the actual bits. But,

441
00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:50.440
you know, it's very difficult
to get your mind around

442
00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:53.200
the fact that what it's
worth is what people will

443
00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:56.710
pay. Oh, that's exactly right.
I mean, often we ask

444
00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:59.890
the question, is this a
prescription or a vitamin? In

445
00:24:59.890 --> 00:25:02.560
other words, do I need
this to live? Or would

446
00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:04.150
it just be nice if
I had one of these

447
00:25:04.150 --> 00:25:07.960
every day? And, and those
kinds of answers are going

448
00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:12.430
to dramatically affect your pricing
strategy for your product. And

449
00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:15.520
very often there's no connection
between the level of effort

450
00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:18.190
that you put into the
development of the product and

451
00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:20.680
the value of that product
in the marketplace. And to

452
00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:21.910
come up with that price,
you're going to have to

453
00:25:21.910 --> 00:25:24.520
do market research. You're going
to have to do some

454
00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:26.890
focus groups and get an
understanding from people what the

455
00:25:26.890 --> 00:25:31.180
criticality of that software might
be to their business. And

456
00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:32.680
the more critical it is,
the more you're going to

457
00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:36.460
be able to charge. And
I think that's really going

458
00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:38.800
to just be a function
of market research, and you

459
00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:41.020
can't base that at all
on spitballing, based on your

460
00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:43.060
level of it. Well, putting
that into the context of

461
00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:45.340
open source licensing, it seems
like there's a lot of

462
00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:48.970
software that people simply aren't
willing to pay for. And,

463
00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:52.540
you know, to Carl's point
pricing is difficult. And oftentimes

464
00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:55.330
if it's worth a dollar
or $2, or if it's

465
00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:57.490
a couple of hundred lines
of something, or if it's,

466
00:25:57.490 --> 00:26:00.970
you know, an MP3 encoder,
but it's not something that's

467
00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:04.180
a 1995 build a company
around it, kind of a

468
00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:07.270
thing. I'm just going to
throw it out there. And

469
00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:09.550
I'm wondering kind of, if
I've just got a bunch

470
00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:11.710
of software and I just
like to put it out

471
00:26:11.710 --> 00:26:15.370
there for the people, but
if in the future, something

472
00:26:15.370 --> 00:26:17.830
comes along where people start
making piles of money off

473
00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:19.270
it, you know, I'd like
them to give me a

474
00:26:19.270 --> 00:26:21.400
call, basically. It's like, I
don't want to build a

475
00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:23.920
business around this, but if
you do call me, I

476
00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:26.650
mean, what, what, what license
is appropriate for that seems

477
00:26:26.650 --> 00:26:28.870
like one could throw as
much stuff out there as

478
00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:33.190
possible and let someone else
take the risk. Well, you

479
00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:39.460
know, That's a kind of
idyllic situation, but, you know,

480
00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:42.340
you do in most instances
retain the rights to the

481
00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:45.300
things that you, and so
there are a number of

482
00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:50.310
software companies. If you remember
way back the company that

483
00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:56.100
built the software pro com
with communications software was in

484
00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:59.820
both the commercial business space
and the shareware business space.

485
00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:04.110
And they just had a
previous version available as shareware

486
00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:07.560
and the current version available
as commercial software, for example.

487
00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:09.930
So they were able through
their shareware model to gain

488
00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:12.780
an understanding of what was
needed in the marketplace, get

489
00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:16.650
recommendations for new features, et
cetera, and build up a

490
00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:19.680
customer base of people that
wanted to use that software.

491
00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:21.990
But then if you wanted
the most recent version you

492
00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:24.060
had to pay for it.
So that was one way

493
00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:28.920
that you could, you know,
deal with that economy. You

494
00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:31.710
know, the, in the, in
sort of modern day, there's

495
00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:35.520
a company called the, my
SQL that, you know, have

496
00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:38.220
a SQL database engine and
they do exactly the same

497
00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:41.190
thing. They have both a
GPL based version of their

498
00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:44.490
product and a commercial version
of their product. And because

499
00:27:44.490 --> 00:27:47.940
they own the copyright, they're
able to distribute the same

500
00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:52.680
software under two different licenses.
And so you can begin

501
00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:55.080
to experiment with the licensing
in such a way that

502
00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:58.170
you're doing the market research.
You're building a community of

503
00:27:58.170 --> 00:28:01.820
people that are going to
support your software downstream, but,

504
00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:04.080
but when it comes to
trying to sell this stuff

505
00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:07.710
into American express, you know,
you can relieve them of

506
00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:10.800
the burdens of a GPL
based license by selling simply

507
00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:13.340
selling it to them. Commercial.
I never understood that. And

508
00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:15.140
I think you were just
about to touch on that,

509
00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:19.550
which is how can somebody
give away software on one

510
00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:22.700
hand and then charge for
the same thing on the

511
00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:25.700
other hand and how, I
mean, how does that possibly

512
00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:27.950
work by what license where
I pick to have the

513
00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:31.730
Scott program community edition that
people have sourced to in

514
00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:34.700
these Scott commercial edition that
I can then sell that's

515
00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:38.180
better. Right? I mean, we,
we, we, we know Rob

516
00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:41.540
Howard does that with community
server, right? I mean, they

517
00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:45.230
have two versions of that
product as well. If it

518
00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:49.010
fundamentally has to do with
what kind of license your

519
00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:52.580
customer wants to be under,
remember that the GPL has

520
00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:55.010
a lot of restrictions and
a lot of signs of

521
00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:57.350
dangers associated with it that
you might not want to

522
00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:59.480
deal with. I might not,
I might want to make,

523
00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:02.810
to, to use the software
commercially, for example, I might

524
00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:04.820
want to distribute a product
that makes use of this

525
00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:06.980
software. And I don't want
to have to worry about

526
00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:09.080
whether or not I'm giving
back the right thing, et

527
00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:11.840
cetera. So just charge me
a license fee and give

528
00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:15.440
me a commercial software license.
And in that context, a

529
00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:18.860
company that my SQL can
go to a SAP for

530
00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:21.230
example, and say, okay, well,
you want to use my,

531
00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:23.930
the, my SQL engine behind
your commercial tools. You can

532
00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:25.880
do it. Here's the royalty
fees you pay for it.

533
00:29:26.270 --> 00:29:27.590
And you don't have to
worry at all about the

534
00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:30.380
GPL. Now there's other people
out there that are using

535
00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:33.110
the GPL version of my
SQL, but SAP doesn't care

536
00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:36.770
about it. It really comes
down to like your tolerance

537
00:29:36.770 --> 00:29:40.790
for being illegal, right? I
mean, a small mom and

538
00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:43.420
pop company with one guy
who doesn't have anything to

539
00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:49.030
lose, can, you know, violate
a GPL agreement by making

540
00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:51.790
copies or whatever, doing whatever
it is with it, but

541
00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:54.490
a big corporation. Who's going
to distribute that to every

542
00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:57.730
desktop. You know, if that's
not covered in the, in

543
00:29:57.730 --> 00:30:02.200
the free license, they're now
vulnerable legally, I guess that's

544
00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:04.620
really what it comes down
to. Isn't it? Well, partly,

545
00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:08.940
I mean, under the GPL,
you can buy one copy

546
00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:10.650
of a piece of offer
and give it to everybody

547
00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:13.710
in your organization. And that
falls within your license. It's

548
00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:17.010
only the point at which
you sort of then republish

549
00:30:17.010 --> 00:30:19.350
it under your own name,
or put out some piece

550
00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:22.110
of that as your own
product that you trigger this

551
00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:27.000
reciprocity, you know, portion of
the license that says that,

552
00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.450
okay, well, you've done a
redistribution now, whatever, whatever it

553
00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:32.160
is, you're redistributing under your
name. You don't have to

554
00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:34.650
get back to everybody to
redistribute it under their names,

555
00:30:34.650 --> 00:30:37.860
right? So, I mean, in
some measure, you, you have

556
00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:41.370
that issue, but if I'm
building a commercial software package

557
00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:45.120
that I'm selling to people,
then it becomes questionable about

558
00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:49.590
whether or not, you know,
I've, I've, maybe I've modified

559
00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:53.340
the source code slightly to
meet my needs to inter-operate

560
00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:55.140
better, et cetera. And I
don't want to make that

561
00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:58.140
available to the community. So
if, like I said, if

562
00:30:58.140 --> 00:30:59.850
I'm SAP, I just go
to my SQL and say,

563
00:30:59.850 --> 00:31:02.700
please give me a commercial
software license where I don't

564
00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:04.500
have to worry about those
things. And the fact that

565
00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:07.050
other people have the source
code to your database, doesn't

566
00:31:07.050 --> 00:31:10.320
matter to me as somebody
who's really just using the

567
00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:13.230
database to power my ERP
app, right? Putting this in

568
00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:15.300
the context of something that
I know like working on

569
00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:19.230
dusk blog, the company that
Clemens vestors, you know, the

570
00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:23.940
father of dusk blogs, new
Teligent released new Teligent dusk

571
00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:26.070
blog, community edition. And that's
the one that we work

572
00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:28.020
on. And that's the DAS
blog that everyone knows. And

573
00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:31.140
I think it's BSD. And,
but they reserve the right

574
00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:35.220
to potentially improve it, add
some features, not release that

575
00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:38.160
source and they can sell
it under a commercial license.

576
00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:40.980
And they, they made us
kind of agree to have

577
00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:42.990
an intelligence in the name
of the, of the product

578
00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:46.200
for the community edition. Jonathan,
can you give us an

579
00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:50.490
example of a licensed software
license that didn't work? Like

580
00:31:50.490 --> 00:31:55.290
somebody chose the wrong model
and it hurt them? I

581
00:31:55.290 --> 00:31:59.190
mean, there's a lot of
ways to interpret that question,

582
00:31:59.190 --> 00:32:05.280
right? I mean, you know,
when a Netscape started failing

583
00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:09.840
in the browser market, they
donated their browser over to

584
00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:13.680
a nonprofit, their source code
of a new nonprofit to

585
00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:17.010
build it out as an
open source product. And that

586
00:32:17.010 --> 00:32:20.820
was called Mozilla. And for,
you know, many, many years,

587
00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:24.180
that project sort of like
collapsed under its own weight

588
00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:27.600
and, and wasn't very effective,
but the very nature of

589
00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:30.870
that kind of open source
licenses that ultimately another team

590
00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:34.170
were able to take that
core technology and develop it

591
00:32:34.170 --> 00:32:39.260
into Firefox, which has become
a really relevant competitor to

592
00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:42.020
explore and Safari in the
marketplace. And so, you know,

593
00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:44.390
it wasn't right for the
Mozilla project in some ways,

594
00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:47.720
but it really worked out
well for Firefox, you know,

595
00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:50.510
so you'll see situations where
there's commercial software that will

596
00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:56.210
be kind of donated into
the open source arena because

597
00:32:56.210 --> 00:32:59.240
it didn't work as a
commercial product. And so it

598
00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:03.260
helps generate Goodwill and a
source code base that allows

599
00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:05.570
others maybe to pick up
the ball or a community,

600
00:33:05.570 --> 00:33:07.250
people that pick up the
ball and, and carry it

601
00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:10.780
from there. I'm thinking about
those companies that had software

602
00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:13.960
that you pay once for
in one week, and then

603
00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:19.120
the next week they're charging
a monthly fee for, and,

604
00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:24.070
you know, which is supposedly
great for them, but why

605
00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:26.500
would your user base want
to go from paying once

606
00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:30.810
to paying monthly or else
it stops working? You know,

607
00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:33.490
that software as a service
model sort of works for

608
00:33:33.490 --> 00:33:36.550
some things and not for
others. Right. And I mean,

609
00:33:36.550 --> 00:33:38.680
I guess I don't know
of a specific example where

610
00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:41.110
something has worked or not
worked, but you, you always

611
00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:46.570
have, again, a continuum of,
of possibilities. I mean, you

612
00:33:46.570 --> 00:33:49.210
know, do you want to
just get automatic updates for

613
00:33:49.210 --> 00:33:50.980
a year, or do you
want to buy a piece

614
00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:53.560
of software that only enables
you to get one update

615
00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:56.050
and then you have to
buy an upgrade? For example,

616
00:33:56.050 --> 00:33:58.330
I mean, it sort of
depends on what your business

617
00:33:58.330 --> 00:34:02.140
model is and the degree
to which the vendor's capable

618
00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:05.620
of being flexible. Then as
a customer, you kind of

619
00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:08.530
decide what sort of, you
know, a purchase model you

620
00:34:08.530 --> 00:34:11.500
want to have for the
maintenance of that software going

621
00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:14.860
forward, right? It's, it's mostly
about new versions rather than

622
00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:16.840
just sort of crippling the
one that you have. And

623
00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:19.420
there's the factor we haven't
talked about, which is competition.

624
00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:23.080
You know, that which affects
pricing, which affects your model,

625
00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:25.450
which affects everything. If you
have a competitor out there

626
00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:29.950
that has a particular license
that you know, is more

627
00:34:29.950 --> 00:34:34.270
lenient to the customer and
less commercial yoga, have a

628
00:34:34.270 --> 00:34:38.170
tough time trying to sell
that software under a commercial

629
00:34:38.170 --> 00:34:42.220
license. You know, that's the
theory, right? But then look

630
00:34:42.220 --> 00:34:44.860
at how many people go
out and buy Evian water,

631
00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:49.180
right? I mean, that's, that's
the commercial software version of

632
00:34:49.180 --> 00:34:50.890
the stuff that comes out
of the tap at your

633
00:34:50.890 --> 00:34:54.490
house. And so the degree
to which you're able to

634
00:34:54.490 --> 00:34:57.100
build something that people feel
they can rely on more,

635
00:34:57.430 --> 00:34:59.290
that's going to be better
supported. That has a better

636
00:34:59.290 --> 00:35:02.950
community of people that kind
of back up that software

637
00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:05.290
that know it, the can
implement it on a consultancy

638
00:35:05.290 --> 00:35:07.510
basis. There's a lot of
factors that go into the

639
00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:12.340
value of your product beyond
just the price and features

640
00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:15.820
of that product. And so
I think it's a mistake

641
00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:18.160
to believe that you can't
compete with open source software

642
00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:20.950
with commercial software, because it
happens all the time. Well,

643
00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:22.960
this sounds like a pretty
good place to stop. And

644
00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:24.910
just as we end here,
what was the name of

645
00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:26.440
the website where people can
go up and get a

646
00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:28.600
list of the different open
source licenses so that our

647
00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:31.810
listeners could potentially educate themselves
and make the right decision

648
00:35:31.810 --> 00:35:33.880
about how they want to
release the software that they

649
00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:36.790
might have in their, in
their group. Right. I mean,

650
00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:41.850
the, the open source initiative
or OSI is the organization

651
00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:45.600
that maintains all these open
source licenses and kind of

652
00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:49.290
blesses them as open source.
But let's, you know, keep

653
00:35:49.290 --> 00:35:52.380
in mind that it could
be that you don't want

654
00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:54.570
to do an open source
license, but that you instead

655
00:35:54.570 --> 00:35:57.510
want to make your source
code available under a commercial

656
00:35:57.510 --> 00:36:01.110
license in a type of
reference oriented license for exam.

657
00:36:01.490 --> 00:36:03.800
And can people get involved
with your organization? Oh, they

658
00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:06.740
sure can. I mean, we're
a trade association and we

659
00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:09.320
work on issues related to
public policy. One place, I

660
00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:11.900
guess I'd like to direct
people right now to get

661
00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:14.570
answers of these kinds of
questions. And just talking about

662
00:36:14.570 --> 00:36:18.230
the business side of their
enterprise is something called the

663
00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:22.070
innovator's network. So if they
go to www dot innovators,

664
00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:27.110
hyphen network.org, you'll see a
lot of resources and white

665
00:36:27.110 --> 00:36:31.250
papers and webinars on the
business side of your business.

666
00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:34.190
And I think a lot
of entrepreneurs have, you know,

667
00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:36.350
all they need in terms
of keeping up with the

668
00:36:36.350 --> 00:36:40.190
technology side of the business.
And this site is about

669
00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:42.530
how to form partnerships, how
do identify and protect your

670
00:36:42.530 --> 00:36:46.010
intellectual property, how to do
due diligence on your business,

671
00:36:46.010 --> 00:36:49.430
et cetera. So innovator's network,
I think, is worth checking

672
00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:52.490
out. Great. We'll be sure
to include a link to

673
00:36:52.490 --> 00:36:55.130
the innovators network on both
the Hanselman at site and

674
00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:57.980
on the, on my blog.
Thanks a lot for taking

675
00:36:57.980 --> 00:36:59.390
so much time out of
your day to talk to

676
00:36:59.390 --> 00:37:02.360
Carl and I, Jonathan, I
really appreciate it. And we'll

677
00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:04.040
see you next week on
Hanselman.
