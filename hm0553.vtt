This is Lawrence Ryan announcing show
number 553. In this episode,

10
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:07.070
Scott talks with Woody Zul
about mob programming. Hi, this

11
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.530
is Scott Hanselman. This is
another episode of Hansel minutes

12
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.740
today. I have the pleasure
of chatting with Woody Zul

13
00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.100
from mob programming.org. How are
you, sir? I'm doing great.

14
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.360
Scott. I love this name,
mob programming. I've done pair

15
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.030
programming. Why, what does mob
programming? Well, to make it

16
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.430
clear, the name itself was
just kind of a joke

17
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.210
that we used when we
referred to ourselves. And as

18
00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.820
other people started hearing about
what we were doing, we

19
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.790
didn't change it. So if
you think about a mob

20
00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.370
as being a group of
people who have gathered together

21
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.360
to take an action, to
do something, that's what we

22
00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.860
are did. Is this something
that someone like very smart,

23
00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.690
like went up on the
top of a mountain and

24
00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.520
then came up with, and
then brought it down from

25
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.650
the mountain, or I wish
that I could take credit

26
00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.440
for any of this, but
really what it's about is

27
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.070
the idea of a team
that took the time and

28
00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.860
had the freedom to figure
out how they could work

29
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.060
well together. And so it's
really more about discuss a

30
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.210
path of discovery than it
is of somebody saying, here's

31
00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.330
an idea. Let's try it.
It's an interesting thing to

32
00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.790
me that, that this is
what's the beginning of it.

33
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.760
We weren't, there was nowhere
to read about it and

34
00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.010
nowhere to find out about
it. It's just something that

35
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.740
happened to us. Do you
think that that's when kind

36
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.530
of the, the great ideas
happen that they are there?

37
00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.470
They're there, they're out there,
like for example, Douglas Crockford

38
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.170
always talks about, you know,
the Jason JavaScript format being

39
00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.480
uncovered or being discovered as
opposed to being invented. Yeah.

40
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.360
That's sort of exactly. The
idea is if you're open

41
00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.960
to discovery, which means you
have to be paying attention

42
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.250
to little differences and little
hints of things, then you

43
00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.560
know, then that innovation is
going to happen. You have

44
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.650
a chance edit anyway. And
if you open to the

45
00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.310
universe. Yeah. Well, yeah, that's
one way to think of

46
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.810
it. You have to be
open to those things that

47
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.190
are already floating around that
are inside of us, that

48
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.820
we usually don't hear. You
know, we're not, there's too

49
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.920
much noise going on around
for us to pay attention

50
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.240
to those things. So what
was this team like and

51
00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.670
what were you building? And
then how was this discovered?

52
00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.170
Well, so basically I'd been
hired to be a manager

53
00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.380
of a team or a
supervisor of a team. And

54
00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.420
so when I came on,
there was certain things that

55
00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.990
were really important to me
and I'd reviewed the code

56
00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.230
and took a lot of
time to decide whether I

57
00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.320
would want to work for
this company or not. And

58
00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.800
for, with this team or
not. And once that was

59
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.380
all kind of worked through
where I understood what I

60
00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.050
was getting myself into and
decided to go to work

61
00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:47.970
with them. We basically had
a team of five or

62
00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.870
six people that were working
essentially siloed on separate things.

63
00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.350
So one developer would be
working on one project, another

64
00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.950
developer on another project and
they'd assist each other whenever

65
00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.410
it was necessary. But there
wasn't really the idea of

66
00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.810
this was a team all
working on the same thing

67
00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.530
with the same goals. Well,
they have interfaces that they

68
00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.030
would share. I mean, it's
hit print. It sounds like

69
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.720
a pretty typical experience. Oh,
that's a really good point.

70
00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.590
This, this was mostly internal
work and it was separate

71
00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.360
projects that were used throughout
the company or different departments

72
00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.000
of the company. So one
person might be working on

73
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.730
something for this department and
someone else was working somebody,

74
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.370
something for that department. So
they really weren't even working

75
00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.220
on the same project a
lot of the time, sometimes

76
00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:37.770
they were, but it's not
unusual, you know, software development

77
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.490
element of an it department
in, in many companies where

78
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.160
there's lots of internal need
for software that you just

79
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.210
can't buy and you need
to have it available somehow.

80
00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.480
So you make it yourself.
Did the concept of pair

81
00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.650
programming exist at this time?
So well within the company,

82
00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.440
they weren't pair programming. Of
course, pair group programming itself

83
00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.530
had been around a long
time. I joined this firm

84
00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:06.690
in, let's see it was
2011 about April. So, you

85
00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.060
know, pair programming had been
around in some form or

86
00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.300
another since the late nineties.
And I was introduced to

87
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.290
it myself in 1999. And
once I got used to

88
00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:20.190
working that way, it became
sort of my default way

89
00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.470
of working after a while.
It was like, boy, if

90
00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.350
I work with a pair,
I have less headaches. So

91
00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.230
I prefer to work with
a pair. So that's basically

92
00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:29.640
what it was. And that's
the thing I liked to

93
00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.740
do, but I would never
tell somebody else, Hey, you

94
00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.100
gotta work. You gotta do
pair programming. You know, it's

95
00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.190
not the kind of thing
yet with demand ever, The

96
00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.980
only time I've ever gotten
even close to any kind

97
00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.890
of mob or coming up
with a group programming would

98
00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:48.180
be during code reviews. How
did you all discover that

99
00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:49.620
this was a useful thing?
Was it in the middle

100
00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.140
of a code review? Oh,
that's a really interesting point,

101
00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.630
but I have seen that
in code reviews, but that's

102
00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:58.070
not what we were doing.
What had happened was once

103
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.070
I joined this firm, there's
a thing that's important to

104
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:04.260
me. And that's that we
study together that the, that

105
00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.790
the group of people that
we call a team has

106
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:10.850
to find ways to interact
well as humans with each

107
00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:12.980
other. And one way of
doing that, that I found

108
00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:16.310
really, really works well is
to study together because we

109
00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.770
don't have the pressure of
doing work that's with a

110
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:25.370
deliverable. And therefore we, we
can be more relaxed. We're

111
00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.900
not feeling like it's one
person, you know, like your

112
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.600
job's gonna depend on you
getting this work done so

113
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.150
we can help each other
learn. And it's a different

114
00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:38.090
interaction with each other. And
I believe that if you

115
00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:40.610
take that and really take
it seriously, we're going to

116
00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:44.000
study together. We're going to
practice together. Then we can

117
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.590
end up with a, we
can end up with a

118
00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:53.090
work dynamic, or I should
say this study dynamic overflows

119
00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:56.720
into our work dynamic. So
where we are usually under

120
00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.360
pressure, when somebody comes to
us, you know, let's say

121
00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.820
we're sitting in coding and
another team member comes over

122
00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:03.500
and says, Hey, I'm working
on this thing and I

123
00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.360
need some help with it.
And I think you're more

124
00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.190
of an expert. Can you
spend some time with me?

125
00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:10.160
Well, now we're distracting that
person from the work they

126
00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:14.120
need to be getting done.
And the dynamic just isn't

127
00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:18.590
really conducive to learning how
to work well together. It

128
00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:21.640
says we're working together. It
sounds like you already had

129
00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:25.360
a collaborative and fairly positive
nurturing environment, for lack of

130
00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.270
a better word. Otherwise, people
who were learning together might

131
00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:30.040
be afraid that they were
going to look bad. If

132
00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.620
they didn't know something, it
didn't feel like a competition.

133
00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:35.920
Yeah, that's really insightful because
that's one of the things

134
00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.590
that happens a lot in
software you'll even see people

135
00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:43.300
like a very proficient developer
might insist on doing something

136
00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:46.720
their way, because that's what
they're being paid to do

137
00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.540
is say, I know how
to do this, right? So

138
00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.170
the environment, when I arrived
there, we were not doing

139
00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:55.810
these study sessions. I was,
I think that I introduced

140
00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:59.560
is let's open up every
Friday. Let's study for two

141
00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:02.770
to three hours every Friday
and we would get together.

142
00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:04.810
And rather than just get
out books and read them,

143
00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:08.680
we're going to code together.
And we decided based on

144
00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.420
a lot of experience, I've
had that let's use a

145
00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:13.030
coding dojo style. I showed
him what it was, the

146
00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:17.350
particular style we used is
sort of, they call Randori.

147
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:19.630
I'm not really sure why,
but the idea is somebody

148
00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:21.790
is going to sit at
the computer. They're going to

149
00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:24.790
take direction from another person.
And that person is standing

150
00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:26.830
in the way we would
do it. And everyone else's

151
00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:29.620
an observer and we would
use a timer. So every

152
00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:32.800
four minutes the navigator would
become the driver. So that

153
00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:35.950
means the person standing, giving
instructions would sit down at

154
00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:39.310
the computer and become the
person receiving instructions, call that

155
00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:43.180
person, the driver and the
next person in role becomes

156
00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:46.420
the next navigator. So what
this requires is that everybody

157
00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:49.000
pay attention. So when it
was their turn to navigate,

158
00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:51.220
they have an idea of
where we're headed and what

159
00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:53.320
we need to do next.
So they're kind of following

160
00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.190
along, trying to pay attention
to everything that's so they

161
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:58.950
know the intent of what
we're doing. So by using

162
00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:02.880
this little model of studying
together for writing code together,

163
00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:07.500
we're usually working on simple
code. Katas like, Oh, tic

164
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:10.830
TAC, toe game, or the
bowling game, or any of

165
00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:12.900
the, you know, Roman numerals
or any of the things

166
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:16.230
that you might do in
a study session. So that's

167
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:18.690
basically what we were doing.
We were, we spent, I

168
00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:21.570
think almost six months, every
Friday for two to three

169
00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:26.010
hours having a study session
together learning. So there will,

170
00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.960
there's a lot of reasons.
I think it's important to

171
00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:34.290
do it. We were learning
clean code approaches, like how

172
00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:37.170
to split a large method
into smaller methods, how to

173
00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:41.910
rename things, to make it
more understandable. So the code

174
00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:45.620
can be more expressive and
things like that. So Just

175
00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:48.200
to make sure that folks
that were listening are understanding

176
00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.970
the word that you said
at the beginning though, to

177
00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:52.670
make sure that they heard
that was Ren Dory, R

178
00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:56.240
a N D O R
I a N a Randori

179
00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.580
it's a term it's used
in Japanese martial arts indicate

180
00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:03.350
freestyle practice. So you're, you're
working on a kata or

181
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:05.240
a series of problems and
you're just kind of switching

182
00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:07.280
it up, right. You're moving
from the driver and the

183
00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:10.640
copilot are changing. Yeah. So
actually, so if we think

184
00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:13.430
of it, this way, the
person at the keyboard, their

185
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:16.190
job is to listen to
the instructions coming from the

186
00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:19.370
navigator. And so we call
it a driver navigator, but

187
00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:20.810
you could think of it
like a pilot in a

188
00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:24.110
plane, the pilot in a
plane with a navigator, the

189
00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:27.620
pilot may not know the
mission or the exact headings

190
00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:30.110
or what route we're going
to take or anything like

191
00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:33.020
that. They just have to
keep the plane flying. The

192
00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:36.080
navigator is paying attention to
what heading do we need

193
00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:38.210
to be on and so
on. And they're giving that

194
00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:41.120
instruction as we go. As
a matter of fact, as

195
00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:44.630
we're inventing the mission, because
in software, there's a lot

196
00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:47.330
of discovery going on as
we're inventing how we're going

197
00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:49.940
to solve this problem. That's
a big part of the

198
00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:52.010
job of the navigator. What
are we going to do

199
00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:55.310
next? And as we're rotating
through this, and we use

200
00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:59.420
a very short timer about
four minutes. So the driver's

201
00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:01.940
moving out of the driver's
seat and the navigators taking

202
00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:06.110
that seat every four minutes,
a new person's navigating. So

203
00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:08.960
it's requires that we it's,
they call it around Randori,

204
00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:11.450
but I'm not really sure
if that's the model of

205
00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:14.240
it in martial arts, I
don't do martial arts. So

206
00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:17.060
this is just the terminology
that they've used in coding

207
00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:19.670
dojo and things like that.
Yeah. I think it seems

208
00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:22.040
to fit though. It does
sort of fit. So I,

209
00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:25.310
if I was going to
be doing this, I think

210
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:27.260
that the idea of a
rotation is the way we

211
00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:28.910
use it. So the word
I think of is a

212
00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:32.330
rotation rather than a Randori
because the job of the

213
00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:36.500
person at the keyboard is
to listen to whatever the

214
00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:39.200
idea that we want to
code that's coming from the

215
00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.540
navigator. So as soon as
he sit down at the

216
00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:45.200
keyboard, you can stop thinking
about the problem space. And

217
00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:49.130
you just thinking about translating
an idea into code and

218
00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:53.680
the ideas coming from another
person, oddly, I should say,

219
00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:56.260
although this wasn't our intention,
our intention was just to

220
00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.410
have a good way of
learning together. We were learning

221
00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:03.430
how to allow each other
to talk and learning how

222
00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:07.240
to express ourselves better. So
that's where this started from.

223
00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:09.660
If it was I've done
it, I think similar to

224
00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:12.120
it in the past, like
lunchtime learnings where we'd sit

225
00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:14.790
down, open up some code,
and this was at other

226
00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:17.880
companies, open up some code
in the, in the company's

227
00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.760
code base that everybody hated
working on. And we'd have

228
00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:22.290
somebody at the keyboard and
the rest of us will

229
00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:24.420
be talking about how to
make it better. And the

230
00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:26.070
person at the keyboard would
just go ahead and make

231
00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:28.950
it better, you know, based
on what the instructions that

232
00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:31.470
were coming. So we'd done
this before over the last,

233
00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:34.140
I don't know, 10 years
at other places I've worked,

234
00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:37.290
but once I learned this
coding dojo style of the

235
00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:39.990
Randori, I just loved it
so much. It really made

236
00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:44.940
me feel excited and energized
whenever we did it. So

237
00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:47.130
I've introduced it every chance
I get, if I'm at

238
00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:50.700
a code camp or a
conference or a user group,

239
00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:53.520
and the people want to
code, I introduced that. And

240
00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:54.720
of course, a lot of
people are doing it. I

241
00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:56.790
didn't invent it. A matter
of fact, I was shown

242
00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:59.970
it by originally by Llewellyn
Falco, who learned it from

243
00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:02.250
some other people who had
come up with some of

244
00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:06.990
these ideas that the software
craftsmanship, community Paris. So it's

245
00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:09.660
one of these ideas have
been floating around, but to

246
00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:12.960
get to how this happened
for us, one day, we

247
00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:14.670
had a big project that
we kind of put on

248
00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:16.590
the back burner. It was
time to get working on

249
00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:18.780
it. And the people who
were assigned to work on

250
00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:21.540
it previously came to the
group and said, you know,

251
00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:24.960
we want some help this
because cause a lot of

252
00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:28.350
this coding here, we don't
quite understand and we're not

253
00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:30.090
sure what steps to take
in may. We're going to

254
00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:32.400
need everybody's help to work
on this thing. So we

255
00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:35.280
got together in a regular
old fashioned meeting. That's where

256
00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:38.700
people get together to share
some information and whatever it

257
00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:42.600
is we need to talk
about. And then we analyze

258
00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:45.480
it and discuss it. And
after we've done that, we

259
00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:48.870
come up with some ideas
that lead to us, assigning

260
00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:53.100
work to, and then going
off and doing that work.

261
00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:55.560
So that's sort of a
one typical kind of a

262
00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:58.140
meeting. And we gathered for
a meeting like that. But

263
00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:02.340
a very interesting thing happened
as we start looking at

264
00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:05.790
the code, somebody said something
to the effect of I'll

265
00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:07.620
look at that. There's a
long method. Well, we know

266
00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:10.140
how to fix that. We
can compose it. And so

267
00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:13.560
they started navigating the person,
the board to go ahead

268
00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:17.070
and do that work. And
as we did it, we

269
00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:19.470
just start picking off things
in the code and fixing

270
00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:24.480
it, using very similar techniques,
coding dojo. And after about

271
00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:26.010
an hour and a half
of that, somebody came into

272
00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:28.890
the room and said, Hey,
you guys have to leave

273
00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:32.730
scheduled this room. Like you
always have in meeting rooms

274
00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:36.960
in companies. And when that
happened, somebody on the team

275
00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:42.030
almost instantly said, let's go
find another room. That's a

276
00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:45.270
really, for concept two things
happen there. And I say

277
00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:49.650
almost three things happened there.
One was, we noticed some

278
00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:53.210
problems in the code and
this wasn't something that team

279
00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:56.840
was necessarily ready to do
six months earlier, but we've

280
00:14:56.840 --> 00:15:00.230
been studying clean code concepts
for six months. So now

281
00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:02.470
when they looked at code
that could say, Oh, there's

282
00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:05.180
a problem there. We should
fix it. The second thing

283
00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:08.380
was, they knew how to
fix it. Using this model

284
00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:12.670
of communicating out loud, your
idea, and somebody else translating

285
00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:15.100
it into code. When you
do that, it re it,

286
00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:19.120
it makes everybody on the
team aware of what we're

287
00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:22.270
doing and movements that are
being made. And anyone on

288
00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:23.860
the team when you don't
do it as a round

289
00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:26.230
Dory can just pitch in
at any time and say,

290
00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:29.260
Oh wait, gotta change that
thing down there. Or you

291
00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.630
need to work on this
so we can be we're

292
00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:35.470
collaborating now. But the bigger
thing was we noticed that

293
00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:37.990
this was working well for
us and somebody on the

294
00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:41.980
team said, let's go find
another room. So that's what

295
00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:44.350
we actually did. We found
a room there's 10 or

296
00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:46.930
20 rooms across the company.
Went to that room, worked

297
00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:49.060
for another couple hours till
we had to leave there.

298
00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:51.250
But a funny thing also
happened as soon as we

299
00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:54.310
got to the other room,
someone else on the team

300
00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:56.860
said, well, why don't we
just book rooms for the

301
00:15:56.860 --> 00:16:00.340
rest of the day? So
that the team was expressing

302
00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:03.070
the intent that this was
working. So we thought, well,

303
00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:05.770
why don't we just do
it at the end of

304
00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:07.780
the first meeting? They could,
somebody could have said, okay,

305
00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:10.600
let's go back to work
at our cubicles on this

306
00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:13.690
stuff that we started working
on. But rather they said,

307
00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:16.660
let's keep working together. So
that's sort of the discovery

308
00:16:17.050 --> 00:16:20.680
process had happened. We started
out studying together. It grew

309
00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:24.610
into one day we had
enough experience working together. One

310
00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:26.890
day, we all just, all
of a sudden found working

311
00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:30.670
together was actually a good
thing to try and we

312
00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:33.970
didn't want to stop. So
that night we actually, every

313
00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:36.880
evening at the end of
every day, we would do

314
00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:39.610
many retrospective. And at the
end of that day, everybody

315
00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:41.410
said, well, that worked really
well. Let's do it again

316
00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:44.980
tomorrow. So we did it
again the next day. At

317
00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:46.690
the end of that day,
we kind of decided to

318
00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:51.340
try it all week. So
this little team basically just

319
00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:54.310
said, we like this. Let's
keep going. And that's a

320
00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:57.400
concept. I call turnip the
good, which I think I

321
00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:00.310
learned from Kent Beck, from
reading his book on extreme

322
00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:04.030
programming explained in that book.
It's about, he had all

323
00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:06.640
these practices. He knew were
good. He pictured them as

324
00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:09.880
the knobs on a control
board, like volume control board.

325
00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:12.250
And what if I turned
each of them up? How

326
00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:14.590
high could I turn them
up? And I think of

327
00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:16.780
that as being turned up
the good. So it's one

328
00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:18.520
of the things we've been
learning all along over the

329
00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:22.390
last six months when we
first started learning these things.

330
00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:24.700
And I think we just
automatically got to the point

331
00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:26.800
where we were doing that.
So we turn up the

332
00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:29.830
good on something we noticed
was good and we just

333
00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:32.380
kept doing it. That was
literally five years ago. I

334
00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:36.040
believe this month. And we've
continued working together as a

335
00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:40.780
team every day, since then
just went from going from

336
00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:43.150
meeting room to meeting room,
to finding a permanent spot.

337
00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:46.720
And then once we found
a permanent spot, we moved

338
00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:50.940
to a, a larger spot.
And now the team there

339
00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:55.020
has grown to six teams
all working this way. They

340
00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:57.480
have a large work area.
Now we had just one

341
00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:02.060
team before This episode of
Hansel minutes is brought to

342
00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:06.200
you by Braintree payments. Why
make payment integration more difficult

343
00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:09.650
than it has to be?
Braintree's powerful. Full stack payment

344
00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:12.680
platform allows you to accept
nearly any type of payment

345
00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:16.370
from any device. With one
integration, it's flexible to your

346
00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:19.910
system's needs, supports most programming
languages. So whether you're using

347
00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:23.300
Java, Ruby, or Python, you'll
always have a range of

348
00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:27.920
service side and client side
SDKs available. Braintree makes payments

349
00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:30.800
and your job a whole
lot easier. You can learn

351
00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:45.290
let me ask a couple
of precise questions that came

352
00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:49.010
up in my mind. Is
that okay? Absolutely. So how

353
00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:53.360
many people is too many
people? When does this not

354
00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:55.250
scale? Is it like I
used to use the term

355
00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.880
two pizza teams, the size
of the team that could

356
00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:02.630
eat two pizzas, but not
bigger. Well, so for starters,

357
00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:05.000
we had one guy on
the team who could easily

358
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.940
eat both those pizzas. Okay.
Well, that's, that's not that

359
00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:12.230
I worked with us, however,
you know, but clearly this

360
00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:14.750
is an important matter of
fact, there's two questions that

361
00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:17.600
are always asked when I
first introduced this topic and

362
00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:20.780
that's one of them. Here's
the thing. It's not about

363
00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:24.290
the exact size of the
team. It's about the need

364
00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:28.880
for us to work well
on things. And what are

365
00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:33.950
the things that, that hampers
teams from working well is

366
00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:37.040
when they get a question
that's blocking the team. So

367
00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:39.980
if we're working along and
we get a question that

368
00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:43.520
the team can't answer themselves,
that's a hint that there's

369
00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:46.880
somebody else that belongs on
this team because it's, as

370
00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:49.910
if we can answer all
questions within a minute or

371
00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:52.460
two of when they come
up, we can just keep

372
00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:55.100
rolling throughout the day. There's
something I've noticed over the

373
00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:58.130
years. And I call it
question queue time. If you're

374
00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:00.950
working on coding something, let's
say you're working alone and

375
00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:03.080
you come to something, you
need to ask the guy

376
00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:04.670
on the team that maybe
is an expert on the

377
00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:08.390
database. Now you have a
blocking question because you can't

378
00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:10.940
continue working until you get
the answer. You go to

379
00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:13.940
their desk to get the
answer and Oh, they're not

380
00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:16.190
there right now. So you
send them an email, they

381
00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:18.290
send back a note saying,
well, yeah, I can, I

382
00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:19.940
can help you, but I'm
really busy today. How about

383
00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:22.010
tomorrow morning? So all of
a sudden we have a

384
00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:24.770
four hour period until the
next day, you know, and

385
00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:26.900
the next morning that til
we can get the answer.

386
00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:30.050
So when we work as
a team, the mob programming

387
00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:32.630
team, one of the big
benefits is that we can

388
00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:35.480
answer each other's questions immediately.
We're all in the same

389
00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:38.810
context. And it's all of
our job to get this

390
00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:42.020
particular thing we're working on
done rather than I'm working

391
00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:45.620
on this thing. You're working
on that thing. So, so

392
00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:47.830
to guess what would be
a good size for the

393
00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:51.370
team? I think if we
watch, if we're getting blocked

394
00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:53.860
on questions, maybe we don't
have the right number or

395
00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:55.960
the right mix for the
team. We want to have

396
00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:59.860
every question that comes out
answered quickly. That means we

397
00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:02.230
want to have testers on
the team and we want

398
00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:06.250
to have a quality mindset
while we're working on it.

399
00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:09.130
And that comes with the
testing mindset. We want to

400
00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:12.130
have the product expert on
the team. So somebody who

401
00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:14.770
really has a passion for
what is this thing supposed

402
00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:16.960
to do when we're done
with it. And actually the

403
00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:21.710
product person kind of has
the vision or the, they

404
00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:23.590
have an idea of what
they would like to have

405
00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:26.380
happen. The team kind of
knows the reality of what

406
00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:28.990
we can make happen. And
the QA people are the

407
00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:31.570
testers. They know whether it
really does it or not,

408
00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:35.170
and how you would go
about getting that done. So

409
00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:36.970
if we bring all those
people together and work at

410
00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:39.910
the same time, then we
can all answer each other's

411
00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:42.820
questions as we go. Instead
of in some kind of

412
00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:45.190
a phased approach where we
give the work, get the

413
00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:47.200
work from a product owner,
work on it, give it

414
00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:50.740
to a tester. We're not
really helping each other in

415
00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:54.340
real time. So that's one
way. Another thing is if

416
00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:57.340
you feel as a team
member that you're contributing or

417
00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:00.070
you're learning, then this is
a good team to be

418
00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:02.200
on. But if you don't
really feel, you're like you're

419
00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:04.870
contributing and you don't feel
like you're learning cloth and

420
00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:07.480
work on something alone, find
a pair to work with,

421
00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:10.720
or maybe go work with
another team. So the size

422
00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:12.730
of the team is going
to grow and shrink based

423
00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:15.790
on the needs that we
have. And typically it's going

424
00:22:15.790 --> 00:22:18.280
to be four to six
people, but there's no reason

425
00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:21.580
that you couldn't have 10
or 15 people. We were

426
00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:23.410
working on a very critical
thing for a couple of

427
00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:28.030
days and it found we
kept getting blocking questions and

428
00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:30.220
we kept, as we would
contact the people could answer

429
00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:32.080
them. We'd ask them to
come and spend a little

430
00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:34.570
time with us maybe a
day or two, because this

431
00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:36.280
was very critical to the
company that we get this

432
00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:39.010
done quickly. By having everybody
there for a day or

433
00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:42.070
two, we got through the
work really quickly. Everybody was

434
00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:45.100
acting as a navigator, but
not everybody has to act

435
00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:47.710
as a driver. Not everybody
has to take the keyboard.

436
00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:50.860
You take the keyboard. If
you feel comfortable taking the

437
00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:54.130
keyboard, you feel that you
can contribute well taking the

438
00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:58.570
keyboard, but everybody who's there
should be navigating their need

439
00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:01.810
for having them there is
because they can contribute to

440
00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:04.500
what it is we're building.
Well, that brings up an

441
00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:06.510
interesting point. Like you said,
the need to have them

442
00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:09.330
there because when I asked
how many people is too

443
00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:12.990
many, there's actually a couple
of underlying questions there. There's

444
00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:17.070
when are those people just
taking up space, you know,

445
00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:18.690
is, is the issue of
there being too many people

446
00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:22.290
in the room being that
one or more people is

447
00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:24.990
not providing any value or
is not receiving any value.

448
00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:29.010
And then like, like you
couldn't, could you mob program

449
00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:31.560
with 200 people? Probably not,
but there must be an

450
00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:35.760
upper bound that me thinking
about the, the optimal ratio

451
00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:39.420
of people and, you know,
X number of people, times

452
00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:42.540
their hourly rate, that's a
lot of money to maximum

453
00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:45.770
output. Okay. So now you've
come to the second question.

454
00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:49.940
People always ask, how can
this possibly be productive with

455
00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:53.930
five people working at one
computer? Okay. So when we

456
00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:56.140
first started, we just had
the team we had, we

457
00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:58.960
didn't, it wasn't like what's
the right size. It's just,

458
00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:00.940
we had, I think we
had six people. I don't

459
00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:04.930
remember right at the moment,
five or six people. What's

460
00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:07.090
the right number. Well, this
was the people we had

461
00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:09.430
and often in companies, that's
what you have is whatever

462
00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:13.570
you have, as far as
productivity, productivity is a trick

463
00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:19.390
concept. I can be highly
productive, producing something nobody wants.

464
00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:23.530
So there is always the
idea of effect. Are we

465
00:24:23.530 --> 00:24:26.410
working on the right thing,
which is always more important

466
00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:32.200
than working on efficiently on
getting something done. So part

467
00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:34.420
of having the whole team
there is that we can

468
00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:37.690
steer much quicker to the
right thing. We never start

469
00:24:37.690 --> 00:24:41.140
knowing what's the right thing
to be working. We've discovered

470
00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:43.420
that as we do the
work and as we discover

471
00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:46.720
that we want to be
able to quickly get feedback

472
00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:49.030
as to whether this thing
is, is the right thing

473
00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:52.270
to be working on or
not. So at what point

474
00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:56.260
does it drop off? As
far as productivity goes, I

475
00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:59.350
would say a better question
then how can five people

476
00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:04.150
be productive working at a
single computer, that question over

477
00:25:04.450 --> 00:25:07.540
and ask, how can we
be productive if we separate

478
00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:11.590
the people who should be
working together? Oh, gee, you

479
00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:13.590
look, and you just flipped
it right there. That that

480
00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:16.210
was a, that's a great
answer. Yeah. And that took

481
00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:18.580
me several years to figure
out. So don't get the

482
00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:22.540
idea. The first time I
was asked, this question was

483
00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:26.440
the first time, or actually
I'd been asked it several

484
00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:28.360
times, but the first time
I was asked at <inaudible>

485
00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:31.720
a in giving a talk
about, this was the first

486
00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:34.150
time I gave the talk
about this, the fruit, the

487
00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:37.150
two things always ask. And
so I wrote them down

488
00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:38.860
and I said, I better
be prepared to answer those

489
00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:41.320
questions. But the answer that
I gave the first time

490
00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:43.690
I was asked, how can
five people be productive at

491
00:25:43.690 --> 00:25:48.490
one computer? My response was,
I don't does that matter

492
00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:53.140
because it doesn't matter if
we can be productive. What

493
00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:56.380
matters is that we noticed
whether we are productive or

494
00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:58.330
not. And if we notice
that we were, and that's

495
00:25:58.330 --> 00:26:00.790
what the team was noticing,
dang, in this first day,

496
00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:04.090
we got a lot done.
We all felt like we

497
00:26:04.090 --> 00:26:07.180
learned a lot. And we
were getting through a project

498
00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:09.550
that had been a problem
for the company. And we

499
00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:12.250
were all getting to an
understanding of a project that

500
00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:15.280
we probably would end up
needing everybody's brain power on.

501
00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:18.730
So yeah, so now, but
we got to take this

502
00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:22.300
a step further if you
don't mind that. So here's

503
00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:25.840
the thing. There's a guy
named Peter block. He's, he's

504
00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:33.550
a great author about software
development and more about consulting.

505
00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:36.370
I'm not sure if it's
his talk he's anything about

506
00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:39.640
software development, just knowledge work
and things like that. And

507
00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:41.230
he has a saying, and
I I'm going to code

508
00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:43.030
it, quoted off the cuff
because I don't have it

509
00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:47.100
front of me. But he
says basically a transformation comes

510
00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:52.950
more from pursuing profound questions
rather than seeking practical answers.

511
00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:58.170
So if we pursue profound
questions, what usually happens is

512
00:26:58.170 --> 00:27:01.140
we just come up with
better questions and the better,

513
00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:03.630
the questions, the better thinking
we're going to end up

514
00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:06.600
being able to do. And
what I've found is if

515
00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:09.690
we're driving for answers, what
we usually get when we

516
00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:12.480
drive for an answer is
just the seeds of our

517
00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:15.810
next problem. So since we
have an answer to something,

518
00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:18.030
all we're doing is introducing
some things are going to

519
00:27:18.030 --> 00:27:21.600
become a problem for us
soon. We didn't, we didn't

520
00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:24.360
delve in it deep enough
to really come to the

521
00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:27.180
profound things we need to
do. So I started asking

522
00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:30.420
that question as we started
pondering this, this is what

523
00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:34.050
we came up with. Sure.
We can ask, how could

524
00:27:34.050 --> 00:27:37.230
this be productive? But what's
the real root of this.

525
00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:39.960
Or one step towards root
of it is to ask

526
00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:44.370
what are the things that
destroy productivity. If we could

527
00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:47.310
get a handle on understanding
about the things that destroy

528
00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:51.510
productivity, then we can understand
why is it more productive

529
00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:55.830
to separate people? Because if
the things that destroy productivity

530
00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:58.110
are there, because the people
are too close to each

531
00:27:58.110 --> 00:28:00.570
other and they're working together,
then we would have a

532
00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:03.840
reason to separate people. So,
or to have them working

533
00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:06.810
together. So instead of asking
the question, how can this

534
00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:09.750
one way or that one
way be more productive. Let's

535
00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:12.720
talk about the things that
destroy productivity. So when I

536
00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:15.720
asked that question of groups
and I've gotten probably two

537
00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:18.450
or 300 answers to this,
some of the typical things

538
00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:21.510
are bugs, destroy productivity. Soon
as we have to work

539
00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:24.570
on a bug, I'm now
no longer working on my

540
00:28:24.570 --> 00:28:28.110
code that I needed to
deliver. Another thing is meetings.

541
00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:30.480
I was at a place
just a couple of month

542
00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:33.030
ago or so. And I
asked the team of developers,

543
00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:35.970
you know, how much time
do you get a day

544
00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:37.830
to code? And they said
about an hour and a

545
00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:39.510
half. So what do you
spend the rest of your

546
00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:42.810
time doing we're in meetings?
Well, what are those meetings?

547
00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:45.450
Well, they're about the work
we're going to do. They're

548
00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:47.220
going to, they're about a
project we might do next

549
00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:50.490
year. And they're about reviewing
the stuff we've already done.

550
00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:55.920
Giving pro progress reports, so
on and so on. So

551
00:28:56.100 --> 00:29:00.090
another thing that often comes
up is hard to read

552
00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:04.800
code. Another thing is interruptions.
Another thing is context switching.

553
00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:08.670
And then one that is
almost present everywhere. Is that

554
00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:12.060
question queue time, I can't
get an answer to something

555
00:29:12.210 --> 00:29:15.180
that's blocking me the information
I need. I don't even

556
00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:19.140
know who has that information.
So once we start delving

557
00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:22.020
into what are the things
that destroy productivity to me,

558
00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:27.660
this is a key thing.
And that is this. When

559
00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:30.000
we started working well as
a group, turning up the

560
00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.300
good on working well together,
a lot of the things

561
00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:38.220
that destroy productivity faded away
for us, we didn't try

562
00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:42.070
to solve any of those
problems. We just having those

563
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:46.630
problems turning up the good
on working well together, got

564
00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:48.970
rid of a lot of
the problems that block teams.

565
00:29:50.530 --> 00:29:52.840
So that was a real
eye opener for us. It

566
00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:54.700
had very little for us
to saying, well, here's a

567
00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:56.590
problem we need to solve.
And here's a problem we

568
00:29:56.590 --> 00:29:59.230
need to solve. Like, Oh,
we have this question queue

569
00:29:59.230 --> 00:30:03.010
time. How do we solve
for that would be one

570
00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:05.410
example, or we're always getting
context switching. So how do

571
00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:07.030
we solve for that? In
the old days, it would

572
00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:09.970
be, you got to go
to the change control board

573
00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:13.180
before you can get a
change made to this software

574
00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:16.510
and things like that. So
we got the reverse of

575
00:30:16.510 --> 00:30:19.540
this. We just, all those
problems, I should say, many

576
00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:22.510
of those problems faded away
for us. So it was

577
00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:24.610
kind of like we didn't
set out to invent that

578
00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:27.490
and we didn't put that
in place. It just happened

579
00:30:27.490 --> 00:30:33.240
for us. Do you think
that mob programming is something

580
00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:36.150
that the people who are
listening should explore, is this

581
00:30:36.150 --> 00:30:40.860
for everyone? Or do they
require some, some minimal skills

582
00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:44.130
or minimal kinds of personalities?
Or do you really think

583
00:30:44.130 --> 00:30:45.480
it's just to give it
a try and if it

584
00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:49.320
fits, try, continue to try
it. Yeah. That's a good

585
00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:54.240
question because this isn't something
that you just can automatically

586
00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:58.080
be good at. It's like
if you took four teenagers

587
00:30:58.110 --> 00:30:59.670
and they want to have
a rock and roll band,

588
00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:01.830
and none of them have
ever played a musical instrument

589
00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:04.110
before, we've got a lot
of stuff we need to

590
00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:06.930
learn to do before we
can even discover whether we're

591
00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:09.570
going to have a decent
band that can even play

592
00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:12.600
anywhere except our garage, you
know, and garage bands are

593
00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:14.250
great by the way. So
I don't want to be

594
00:31:14.250 --> 00:31:17.040
a little loud at all,
but you get the picture.

595
00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:19.380
It's like, yeah, this isn't
something you just say, Oh,

596
00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:21.390
we're all going to be
automatically good at working with

597
00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:24.090
each other. So one of
the things that we noticed

598
00:31:24.090 --> 00:31:27.180
for ourselves after working for
a couple months was we

599
00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:29.310
were getting on each other's
nerves. You know, you work

600
00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:31.890
with somebody all day long,
every day, where you've used

601
00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:35.610
to protecting yourself from the
nonsense of the workplace, by

602
00:31:35.610 --> 00:31:38.970
working alone. Well, now you
don't have that hiding spot

603
00:31:38.970 --> 00:31:42.660
anymore. So whether you're an
extrovert or an introvert, whether

604
00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:45.690
you're a highly technical capable
person or someone who's just

605
00:31:45.690 --> 00:31:48.600
learning, there's a place for
you on a team, but

606
00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:50.910
we have to learn techniques
and ways to work with

607
00:31:50.910 --> 00:31:54.360
this. So it just doesn't
turn into a, a problem

608
00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:58.020
for everyone. So we noticed
that for ourselves, that we

609
00:31:58.020 --> 00:32:00.480
were actually getting on each
other's nerves. So that the

610
00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:02.820
first step we would always
do when we notice something,

611
00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:05.550
anything is we would try
to found the, find the

612
00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:09.090
profound question to ask about
it. And this is the

613
00:32:09.090 --> 00:32:13.890
question we decided to ask
each other. Let me see

614
00:32:13.890 --> 00:32:16.020
if I can phrase it.
Well, how would you like

615
00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:20.670
to be treated by your
coworkers? Let's write that down

616
00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:22.650
as a one word thing
on a post it note,

617
00:32:22.890 --> 00:32:25.380
and everybody write as many
of those one word post

618
00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:27.360
it notes. Am I allowed
to say post to note,

619
00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:32.070
I should say sticky notes,
sticky notes. And we're going

620
00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:33.630
to gather them about the
board. And we're going to

621
00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:37.260
do an affinity grouping by
grouping, by theme these words

622
00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:38.850
and see if we can
come up with some words

623
00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:41.420
about how we want to
be treated. We came up

624
00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:44.510
with some words and the
three that we settled on

625
00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:47.360
was we need to, we
want to be treated with

626
00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:53.690
kindness, consideration and respect. And
so once we did that,

627
00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:55.490
we had to ask each
other, well, how do we

628
00:32:55.490 --> 00:32:59.570
do that? Because we clearly
weren't already doing it or

629
00:32:59.570 --> 00:33:02.630
else maybe we wouldn't have
these problems. So we kind

630
00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:04.040
of made a pact with
each other. We're going to

631
00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:08.060
pretend to treat each other
with kindness, consideration, respect. Let's

632
00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:10.280
do that for a day
and see what that feels

633
00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:14.810
like. And if we could
do that for a day

634
00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:17.840
or two, then maybe we
could learn how to go

635
00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:21.560
beyond that. And that's what
we did. So we actually

636
00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:24.440
made this little rule for
ourselves. I don't know if

637
00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:26.060
a rule is the right
thing, but we're going to

638
00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:28.850
try and learn to treat
each other with kindness, consideration

639
00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:31.550
and respect. So if you
bring a bunch of people

640
00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:33.710
together who are already working
on a team, but they

641
00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:38.270
don't necessarily work really well
with each other already, then

642
00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:40.640
they need to build those
skills. And we had been

643
00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:43.880
doing our coding dojo for
six months, which was basically

644
00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:47.510
us learning how to work
well together. We just didn't

645
00:33:47.510 --> 00:33:50.270
know that's what we were
doing, because the weird thing

646
00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:52.550
about the coding dojo is
the rules that we would

647
00:33:52.550 --> 00:33:55.820
follow is the only person
allowed to talk is the

648
00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:59.180
navigator. So you have to
save your ideas up until

649
00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:02.570
it's your turn to talk.
And that teaches you how

650
00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:05.090
to stay, how to have
a stillness and how to

651
00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:08.150
be quiet for awhile and
keep your train of thought.

652
00:34:08.150 --> 00:34:11.030
So when it's your turn
to inject an idea, you

653
00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:13.250
can, now we don't work
that way. That's how the

654
00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:16.160
coding dojo worked. When we
work, anybody can speak at

655
00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:19.910
any time, we have to
be noticing that someone else

656
00:34:20.150 --> 00:34:22.730
it's their turn to talk,
let them finish what their

657
00:34:22.730 --> 00:34:26.180
ideas, and then you can
bring forward your idea. And

658
00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:28.520
that means we have to
start getting good at trying

659
00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:31.970
other people's ideas. We have
to learn to express our

660
00:34:31.970 --> 00:34:36.560
own ideas, listen to the
other ideas, and then try

661
00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:39.500
other people's ideas. These are
not necessarily easy things for

662
00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:41.600
programmers to do, who are
used to saying, I know

663
00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:43.790
how to do this, or
this is the way we

664
00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:46.100
should do it. Let's analyze
all of this first and

665
00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:49.730
decide on that. So can
everybody do this? My roundabout

666
00:34:49.730 --> 00:34:52.040
answer kind of is I
think so, but we need

667
00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:55.730
to practice it, but it's
certainly worth exploring. I would

668
00:34:55.730 --> 00:34:58.220
never recommend it. Say your
company, you should do this,

669
00:34:58.610 --> 00:35:00.260
but I could say, Hey,
it's a fun thing. Set

670
00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:02.600
aside a half a day
and give it a whirl.

671
00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:04.940
It's kind of fun. People
are trying to all over

672
00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:08.230
the place. Very cool. Well,
people can learn about mob

673
00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:14.440
programming@mobprogramming.org. And there's a link
there to lean pub.com/mob programming,

674
00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:16.960
where people can put some
money in and encourage you

675
00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:21.220
and Kevin Meadows to finish your
book on mob programming. Yeah,

676
00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:24.430
we're working on a chapter
right now. It's probably going

677
00:35:24.430 --> 00:35:25.840
to be the last chapter.
We have one or two

678
00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:28.300
more to do, but the
book could be purchased. Cause

679
00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:31.690
lean pub's model is to
make the book available before

680
00:35:31.690 --> 00:35:34.960
it's done and sort of
in a lean way. And

681
00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:37.980
we're working on doing this
remotely. So there's a lot

682
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:39.930
of teams that are doing
that to teams. Aren't actually

683
00:35:39.930 --> 00:35:42.870
sitting in the same room.
They're, they're sitting at their

684
00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:45.810
computers in different parts of
the world and still working

685
00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:48.660
together at the same time
using some kind of virtual

686
00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:51.480
environment. So that's a chapter
we're working on. We've been

687
00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:53.310
doing it for about a
year and a half ourselves.

688
00:35:53.730 --> 00:35:56.940
And we're trying to get
some guidelines about how you

689
00:35:56.940 --> 00:36:00.510
can work remotely working this
way. Very cool. Well, thanks

690
00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:02.970
so much for chatting with
me today. Oh, thank you,

691
00:36:02.970 --> 00:36:05.850
Scott. I had a great
time. This has been another

692
00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:08.400
episode of Hansel minutes and
we'll see you again next

693
00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:08.730
week.
