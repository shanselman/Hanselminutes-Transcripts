00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:50.750
<inaudible> From Hanselman it's dot
com. It's Hanselman. It's a

9
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.160
weekly discussion with web developer
and technologist Scott Hanselman. This

10
00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.360
is Lawrence Ryan announcing show number
four 29. In this episode,

11
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.110
Scott talks with Laura's Clinton
about developing for windows phone

12
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.450
8.1. Hi, this is Scott
Hanselman, and this is another

13
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.550
episode of Hansel minutes. And
I am talking with Lars

14
00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.330
Clint. He is a windows
phone developer MVP, and he

15
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.250
is deeply, deeply passionate about
the windows phone platform. I

16
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.950
like the platform, but he's
here to sell me on.

17
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.050
What's really amazing about windows
phone. Even though I have

18
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.030
an app in the app
store, I still get yelled

19
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.280
at for having an iPhone.
So Laura's is going to

20
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.830
sell me on a, on
the great grand future. How's

21
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.440
it going? Yeah. Good. How
are you, Scott? I'm pretty

22
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.510
good. Thank you for, for
reaching out to me about

23
00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.490
this. Cause I know that
you're a big developer on

24
00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.270
the windows phone platform. What's
your, what's your biggest app?

25
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.320
I have a biggest episode.
I'd try and do lots

26
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.190
of little explorative apps. A
lot of my MVP background

27
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.670
is really around helping others
develop apps and mentoring and

28
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.750
exploring and being loud. So
do you do this as

29
00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.590
your day job? No. No,
not at all. No. I

30
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.390
rarely get to touch windows
phone as my day job.

31
00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:03.440
That's why I have to
do it in my own

32
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.910
time. It's it's I can't,
I can't help it. I

33
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.280
just do it well. That's
interesting. So I actually kind

34
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.200
of speaks to your sense
of the strength of the

35
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.630
platform that you are dedicating
volunteer time for this. What

36
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.870
phone do you have? I
have a 10 2010 20.

37
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.020
So that's the one with
the 43 megapixel super camera

38
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.150
that everyone talks about. Exactly.
Yeah, it is pretty unbelievable

39
00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.250
camera. I've now pretty much
stopped carrying around my big

40
00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.070
bulky Diaz alarm just because
it's worked so well. My

41
00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:42.590
wife independently chose a 10
20 as her as her

42
00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.960
camera. And once we set
up the, you know, the

43
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.020
one drive settings such that
she can easily get her

44
00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.300
pictures off of it, she,
you know, she didn't want

45
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.100
to have to plug in
a USB cable and get

46
00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.170
her pictures off that way.
So we said exactly. We

47
00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.750
said, when it's on wifi,
put the best quality pictures

48
00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.380
on one drive. So then
she, from her perspective, she,

49
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.140
as a nontechnical person, she
comes into the house to

50
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.090
make sure the phone's on.
She goes to one drive

51
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.030
and she waits and then
the pen and the pictures

52
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.860
show up and then she
copies them off of the

53
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.170
one drive. I don't know
if she knows how that

54
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.470
works, but it's magic and
she loves it. Yeah, my

55
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.770
partner's the same. She, she
has a 1520 now hold

56
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:19.960
on one of those four
and she just loves the

57
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.860
big screen. And the fact
that it's easy, she had,

58
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.640
yeah, she had iPhones before
and she just cracked it

59
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.400
with them. And I gave
her a couple of choices.

60
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.980
You chose the Android as
well, and she just chose

61
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.650
the windows phone. But the
big one though, the 1520,

62
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.700
especially for a woman, smaller
hands, that's a giant phone.

63
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.150
Yeah. But the cool thing
is that in a handbag,

64
00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:49.470
you can almost always find
it. Okay. That's true. I

65
00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.690
actually, someone walking across the
store, I was at a

66
00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.610
stop light once and I
saw someone walking across the

67
00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.940
street with a, a 15,
20, and from a distance.

68
00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.040
I thought it was a
tablet that is a big

69
00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.930
phones at a six inch
phone, six and a half.

70
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.420
It's six inches, six inches.
The thing is once you

71
00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.790
start using it and you
start using it, you know,

72
00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.700
with one hand, it takes
a couple of days and

73
00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.370
you get used to it.
And now when she picks

74
00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.720
up my phone, she's like,
God, it's tiny. As a

75
00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.030
matter of perception, I've got
a, so I've got the,

76
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.130
my wife has a 10
20, and then for development,

77
00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.860
I have the nine 20,
the red one. And then

78
00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.120
I've got a white 15,
20 with the, what do

79
00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.460
you call it? The little
case that folds up and

80
00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.820
lets you kind of make
a little triangle shaped stand

81
00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.760
and one, yeah, the stand
is lovely. That's a 10

82
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.240
ADP screen and for watching
Netflix or watching videos, and

83
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.420
now that I've got Plex,
the Plex application, I can

84
00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:45.570
watch movies on a plane
and I almost don't need

85
00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.550
an iPad. You know, you
almost don't need a tablet.

86
00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.400
The screen is so big.
Does that say more about

87
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.940
what people use an iPad
for? Yeah. See, for me

88
00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.670
an iPad for my wife,
it's words with friends and

89
00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.260
movies. So that's basically what
the iPad is for. Yeah.

90
00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.380
Right. It's surprising how many
people try to get work

91
00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.540
done on that? No. No.
So the 15, 20 has

92
00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.110
the Trinity piece screen, the
10, 20 and nine twenties

93
00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.770
have the smaller screen. I
feel like the real sweet

94
00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.750
spot. Like if there were
a phone that was going

95
00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.000
to be the phone for
the people, it would be

96
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.280
the, I think what they
call the Verizon icon. The

97
00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.680
gnocchi icon, I think is
that the nine 30 is

98
00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.530
the internet a thing? No
everywhere else in the world

99
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.300
is nine 30. I think
we've arrived. And one is

100
00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.860
the nine to nine or
something. But I agree if

101
00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.150
it had the camera of
the 10, 20 will be

102
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.520
set. Right. So you'd have
a perfect camera. You have

103
00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.900
the true view, camera 43
megapixels and then you'd have

104
00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.330
a tenet P screen on
a four and a half

105
00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.930
inch screens at the side.
I think it's five. Five.

106
00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:52.770
Yeah. After using the 15,
20 giant fablet yeah. Yeah.

107
00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:54.540
Well that's what it is
though. That's a big deal.

108
00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:56.730
I know. I know. And
then switching back to my

109
00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:00.200
iPhone S which is Just
the tiniest tiniest screen, it

110
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:05.180
is definitely definitely frustrating. But
of course the, the usage

111
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.800
of this all comes down
to apps. You know, that's

112
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.480
the thing, I always say
that when all the apps

113
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.050
are there, then I will,
then I will move. And

114
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.470
then recently we announced this
notion of universal apps and

115
00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.730
I'm a little confused. We
had windows phone seven, then

116
00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:22.040
we moved to eight and
the move from seven to

117
00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.870
eight was the move from
a kind of a completely

118
00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:28.010
Silverlight operating system to a,
an operating system kernel that

119
00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:32.140
is based on what's in
windows eight. Is it Sort

120
00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.870
of, yeah, it was, it
was never boring ideas from

121
00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:37.900
it, but it wasn't really
there wasn't it wasn't a

122
00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:42.730
true, I guess, convergence between
the two. So this is

123
00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:46.600
now what's coming soon, you
know, rumors have it that,

124
00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:49.810
you know, a couple of
weeks, all the, the updates

125
00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:52.330
we'll be pushing, but we
pushed out to all the

126
00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:55.240
current windows, eight devices, which
can all be updated to

127
00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:00.580
8.1, which is cool. So
8.1, everyone will get 8.1.

128
00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.790
Exactly. It will be forced
upon them almost, which is

129
00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:06.130
not a bad thing because
it is fully compatible. So

130
00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:09.400
there's, there's really no reason
not to upgrade. You get

131
00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:12.280
an enormous amount of benefits
from it really. It should

132
00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.560
have been called windows four
nine, I think. But I

133
00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.230
guess the, the versioning needs
to be in line with

134
00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:20.860
windows. Right. That's probably the
main reason. So yeah, there

135
00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:25.450
are so there's universal apps
coming. And I guess what

136
00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:28.660
that means is that you,
well, as a developer, you

137
00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:32.400
can have a single project
or a single solution with

138
00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.990
a few projects in it
that will be able to

139
00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:38.710
tag it, both windows and
windows phone in a, I

140
00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:42.580
guess, native way on the
same runtime. Okay. So when

141
00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:45.100
I go file new project
in visual studio now, and

142
00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:47.710
I say, I want to
have an app for both

143
00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:52.780
windows 8.1 full screen apps.
We call store apps, formerly

144
00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:56.080
Metro apps. And I want
to target the phone at

145
00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.390
the exact same time I
get three projects. Is that

146
00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:00.820
right? Yep. That's right. And
you get three projects. So

147
00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:03.160
you get a film project,
you get a windows project

148
00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:06.130
and you get a shared
project. And the shared project

149
00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:09.550
is sort of, it's where
you put all your common

150
00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:12.550
logic. It's similar to what
people have used before with

151
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:17.260
portable class libraries, but where
portable class libraries created a

152
00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.990
DLL for you that you
then used in your project.

153
00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:22.360
There's no deal now. So
it's more like a linked

154
00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:25.720
project basically. Okay. Okay. So
this is a way of

155
00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.480
saying this is all my
shared code. It's not going

156
00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.970
to compile into a deal,
the result of that project.

157
00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:33.790
So that project doesn't really
compile on its own. It

158
00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:37.360
compiles within the context of
Exactly. Exactly. So you still

159
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:42.430
only get two compiled apps
that you then have on

160
00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:44.710
windows and windows. And the
cool thing is then that

161
00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:47.500
you can, you can publish
both to the, to the

162
00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:51.430
app store or to the
store Microsoft store within, you

163
00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:54.730
know, with the same, same
context. And when you compile

164
00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:56.550
them and send them up
to the stores, the two

165
00:08:56.550 --> 00:09:00.150
separate stores with the same
name, I believe there's an

166
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:02.970
it show up in the
store. It says that when

167
00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:04.170
you ha, when I look
in the store and I

168
00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:05.880
see an app, that's a
universal app. It says, Oh,

169
00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:09.110
there's another one. Exactly. How
does that, Where does it

170
00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:11.060
go based on ID or
how does it know that

171
00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:13.760
I've got Fu app here
and Fu up there It's

172
00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:15.560
based on a guru at
which they had some issues

173
00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:19.310
with initially figuring out how
to then attach them the

174
00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:22.970
phone apps to them because
they had different goods, but

175
00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:24.800
I'm not a hundred percent
sure about the details, but

176
00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:29.440
I believe they've sorted that
now. So, and then you

177
00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.550
only have two to bide
wants as well. That'll work

178
00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:35.180
on you and your phone
and your tablet, desktop, whatever

179
00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:37.850
you're using, really. So, okay.
So then I, as like

180
00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:40.490
I'm working on a windows
app right now, although I

181
00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:44.390
am windows phone app, I'm
targeting eight, a phone eight

182
00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:45.920
because I haven't, you know,
I'm going to wait until

183
00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:49.010
it rolls out everywhere. And
one of the things that

184
00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:51.680
I want is then to
make the, the companion app

185
00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:53.960
that runs on windows. And
I want to roam my

186
00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:59.300
settings between the two, Huh?
Yep. Mia, you, you can't

187
00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.730
really do that with a
current windows phone. It, you

188
00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:05.720
will have to either, you
know, upgrade, merge, whatever you

189
00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:08.870
want to call it into
a universal app or windows,

190
00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:12.740
windows store app, as they
also called a project. So

191
00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:17.360
that might be something you
have to do. So right

192
00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.920
now, if I wanted to
do that, I would, I

193
00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:22.040
would hook up my saving
of settings two to one

194
00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:26.090
drive using the SDK and
basically do it manually. But

195
00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:29.840
I understand that with windows
8.1, the idea of saving

196
00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:32.660
into one drive and having
your settings sync Is automatic.

197
00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:36.050
That's right? Yeah. You have
a, it's called roaming roaming

198
00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:39.710
setting the roaming profile for
memory, and you can use

199
00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:43.310
about a hundred kilobytes of,
of storage that you get

200
00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:48.080
that will roam seamlessly between
devices. Right. It's pretty cool.

201
00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:49.910
So then I, I could
either write a whole bunch

202
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:52.580
of code now, you know,
several hundred lines of code

203
00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:54.770
and figure it out or
just wait a little while.

204
00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:57.320
And then when I target
my app to 8.1, it'll

205
00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:01.220
just, Just be a bear
in mind. If you owned

206
00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:03.980
Coney writing an app for
windows phone eight, you will

207
00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:06.290
have to do a bit
of a hard work to

208
00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:08.420
get it, to work as
a, as a universal app.

209
00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:12.140
Or so this is the
confusing part with windows for

210
00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:15.500
an 8.1. There are now
two ways developers can write

211
00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:19.340
apps. And for some reason,
they're now called windows Silverlight

212
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:23.480
apps, which is purely for
phone. And this is using

213
00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:26.780
the same runtime as you
have now with windows phone

214
00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:29.840
eight. And then on the
other side, there is universal

215
00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:33.380
apps, which is using the
windows runtime to run on

216
00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:36.110
both phone and windows. So
you have to choose one

217
00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:40.850
or the other when you
start your project. I see.

218
00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:44.330
Okay. So we know that
windows phone was a primarily

219
00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:48.770
as silver light world before
the, the XAML parsha was,

220
00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:52.460
Silverlight kind of, the runtime
was Silverlight. And then now

221
00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:55.840
that we're running this, this
new core underneath windows eight

222
00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:59.800
and 8.1 expands on that
universal apps, are they more

223
00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:03.240
kind of like windows RT?
Absolutely. They are. They are

224
00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:05.880
windows. RTS. Okay. Okay. So
it's a unified runtime between

225
00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:08.250
the two. Does that mean
that I've got feature parody

226
00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:09.810
or all the things that
I can do in a

227
00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:13.160
Silverlight app available today as
a universal app? No. No,

228
00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:17.220
unfortunately not. So you can
possibly say them artists of

229
00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:19.800
his maybe pushes out a
little bit early, but I

230
00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:22.230
understand why. Cause you know,
they have to start somewhere,

231
00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:24.420
but if you want to
do something like for when

232
00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:28.440
universal apps, if you want
to do stuff like a

233
00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:32.970
clipboard or be a ringtone
provider, set up alarms, do

234
00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:37.020
a lock screen background app,
you can't do that. That's

235
00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:39.750
not currently available. I do
understand that it's coming, but

236
00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:42.030
you can't do that yet.
I see. So they've given

237
00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:44.370
us some of the API
APIs or maybe the top

238
00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:49.170
80%, but that, that last,
last mile is not there

239
00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:51.810
yet. Exactly. And it's the
same if you want to

240
00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:54.510
do well, I don't really
want to call them civil

241
00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:56.880
on apps, but that's what
Microsoft calls them, but let's

242
00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:59.760
call them windows for native
apps. If you want to

243
00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:04.260
upgrade to 8.1, you can,
all your windows on eight

244
00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:07.470
apps will run on 8.1
without, without a problem. But

245
00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:11.250
if you say you were
wanting to, to port your

246
00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:15.480
GPS usage or, you know,
an app that uses GPS

247
00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:18.030
in some way as a
background provider, you can't do

248
00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:20.730
that on 8.1 in Silverlight
or in the native apps.

249
00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:24.060
So bear that in mind,
don't upgrade just Willy nilly.

250
00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:26.400
Cause it might break a
whole bunch of stuff. Just

251
00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.710
be, be mindful. Okay. So
let me think if I

252
00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:31.410
understand this, then there are
features that I can have.

253
00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:34.620
There are new features available
only to the newest app

254
00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:37.620
model, which is universal apps.
Correct. But at the same

255
00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:40.590
time, there are maybe some
underlying operating system features in

256
00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:43.800
that aren't yet available in
universe collapse. Cause those projections

257
00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:47.340
haven't been made available to
developers yet. Yep. Yep. That's

258
00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:50.520
right. And then there are
also features that are not

259
00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:55.740
available to Silverlight 8.1. That
wasn't 8.0. I see. So

260
00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:58.620
it's all a little bit
of a mess it's heading

261
00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:01.710
in the right direction. But
yeah, it's, it's, it's very

262
00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:04.560
valuable to read up on
this before you start porting

263
00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:08.580
or developing. Yeah. Like my
application is a as an

264
00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:12.630
audio podcasting application for news
reading the news, I would

265
00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:15.720
want to check out the,
the roaming of settings, which

266
00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:18.240
is very important to me,
but most important is background

267
00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:21.690
audio. So I would hate
to go, you know, halfway

268
00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:24.000
into doing this and then
discover that some important aspect

269
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.160
of the background, audio services
and available to me as

270
00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:29.520
a universal app yet. Exactly.
And that is or not,

271
00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:33.900
I haven't checked. I actually
believe that it isn't, I

272
00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:36.140
haven't tested that feature cause
I haven't done anything with

273
00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:39.060
a background on you, but
I believe there are some

274
00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:42.330
breaking changes around that. So
yeah. Be mindful. Yeah. So

275
00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:45.000
then the idea though, is
that if, if it has

276
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.530
all the features that I
need and I'm ready to

277
00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:49.680
go, I could go and
create an application that will,

278
00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:53.060
you know, have what 90%
code reuse. If you have

279
00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:56.080
a sense of the reuse,
I've seen figures as high

280
00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:58.360
as 95, but I think
it depends a little bit

281
00:14:58.360 --> 00:14:59.980
on your project type as
well, what you're trying to

282
00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:04.810
do. Right. But yeah, there's
really, really huge benefits. And

283
00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:08.080
then what really excites me
is, yeah, it's cool that

284
00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:10.420
it's here now. It's a
little bit broken, there's a

285
00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:13.870
few features missing, but the,
the rumors that are here

286
00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:17.680
around, around the, the, you
know, the, the stomping grounds

287
00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:21.280
of forums and Twitter and
whatever else is that this

288
00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:26.080
is now going to be
available across windows or Microsoft

289
00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:29.200
platforms so that you can
use it on X-Box in

290
00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:32.050
the future. So you write
an app once, you know,

291
00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:35.080
your, your favorite cooking show
app. Cause that seems to

292
00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:38.920
be the thing in Australia
is to, and then it'll

293
00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:41.290
work on Xbox and it'll
work on windows and it'll

294
00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:43.990
work on windows phone. So
that's the, the kind of

295
00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:46.360
the grand convergence that everyone
talks about that we'll have

296
00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:48.460
one platform. And then one
of the things I think

297
00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:51.790
is really nice is that
folks like Xamarin really seem

298
00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:58.510
enthusiastic about, about embracing this
new model as well. So

299
00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:00.760
when I see them doing
their demos where you've got

300
00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:03.100
a windows app and a
windows phone app, they'll go

301
00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:04.810
and they'll add in an
Android app and they'll use

302
00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:09.520
that same shared project type.
So theoretically I could have

303
00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:13.780
my, my news reading application
on every platform everywhere with

304
00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:17.620
as much reading Use as,
as is possible. That would

305
00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:20.890
be also, that would be
certainly I'm, I'm keen to

306
00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:23.320
see what, how Xamarin pans
out in terms of universal

307
00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:27.700
apps. Cause I'm sure they'll
do something pickers that now

308
00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:30.520
presents new challenges. Cause they
just go to working with

309
00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:32.770
windows phone and there they're
going to change the two

310
00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:36.460
windows runtime. So, but you
know, who knows where it

311
00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:38.950
might go. I know that
Microsoft is working on, you

312
00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:41.110
know, in cast stuff. So
will you be able to

313
00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:44.050
get your news read app
in cars with no voice

314
00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:48.250
control? That would be exactly
that that's what really excites

315
00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:51.880
me is the prospect of
this. If Microsoft sticks to

316
00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:53.740
what they set out to
do with the whole one

317
00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:56.410
direction of everything. Well, it
seems like then from a

318
00:16:56.410 --> 00:16:58.510
developer perspective and correct me
if I'm wrong, that I

319
00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:02.470
should make sure that my
app is using MVVM model

320
00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:05.440
model view, view model, a
kind of architectural style and

321
00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:08.260
is factored is such that
it does not make a

322
00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:10.150
lot of assumptions about what's
going on in the user

323
00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:12.280
interface so that I could
reuse as much of the

324
00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:16.720
core logic As possible. Yeah.
I always use MVVM unless

325
00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:18.820
it's a really simple project
where it's sort of just

326
00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:22.690
adds too much overhead MVVM
to me just makes sense

327
00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:25.630
in, you know, 80% of
cases for phone, at least.

328
00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:31.690
So absolutely I'm finding with
I'm not as experienced The

329
00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:33.610
program was you are. I
think that I'm having a

330
00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:35.950
lot of trouble with asynchrony
and keeping track of like

331
00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:37.930
what's going on in the
background. That's been the most

332
00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:40.810
challenging thing to me, although
it is comforting that I

333
00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:43.180
can do async and a
weight on the way Those

334
00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:45.730
phones. Yes. Yeah, you can.
I was just about to

335
00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:49.650
say that that does help.
But if you have background

336
00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:51.870
tasks though, is always something
you only have to juggle

337
00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:56.580
a few things to get
it manage, but several people

338
00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:59.720
will make it work Well.
Oh well now I'm in

339
00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:02.240
trouble. Yeah. It just, it
just seems like there's so

340
00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:05.180
many things that could potentially
go wrong about on a

341
00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:09.590
mobile device. Cause you're, It
comes and goes, your radio

342
00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:11.900
might turn off at any
time. Your Bluetooth might shut

343
00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:15.740
off. It's really with a
computer, a desktop machine it's

344
00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:18.410
either on or it's not,
and maybe it's on the

345
00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:20.060
internet or it's not, but
for the most part, it's

346
00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:23.810
pretty static with a, with
a phone, other background tasks

347
00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:26.180
and popup notifications can appear.
A lot of stuff can

348
00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:28.550
happen at the same time
while you're trying to run

349
00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:32.360
your app. Exactly. And you
know, yeah. To put a

350
00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:34.850
bit of a plug, I'm
just finishing up my, my

351
00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:37.340
third parole site course, which
is about building your first

352
00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:39.710
windows phone app. And that's
exactly one of the things

353
00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:41.750
I'm talking about is that
you have to be mindful.

354
00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:44.630
Yeah. This is a phone
platform. You have to be,

355
00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:46.970
you know, you have to
think like a user, okay.

356
00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:49.400
I might switch off network.
I might not have network.

357
00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:51.860
I might open another app
suddenly I might come back

358
00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:53.680
to you and you know,
all of this thing, all

359
00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:56.420
these usage scenario and workflows,
you have to think about,

360
00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:58.730
so, Oh, you'll give me
a link to that and

361
00:18:58.730 --> 00:19:00.980
we'll add it to the
show notes. Okay. I shall

362
00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:03.410
it's not live yet. So,
but as soon as it

363
00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:05.330
is, I will. Okay. Okay.
Brilliant. And what do you

364
00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:10.280
think about Microsoft buying Nokia?
Was that a good, I

365
00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:13.880
think it was it's if
you look at it from,

366
00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:18.830
from a noxious side, it's
been, what they've done forever.

367
00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:22.220
Knock has been around for
a long, long time, 140

368
00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:24.860
years or something. And they've
been, you know, they're starting

369
00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:28.970
out producing gumboots and toilet
paper and TVs and they

370
00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:30.830
just sell off all this
stuff. They seem to be

371
00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:34.610
more of an innovative innovate
innovation factory. They come up

372
00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:38.570
with these brilliant businesses and
they sell them off. So

373
00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:41.750
I wasn't surprised it was
a huge part. Of course

374
00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:44.300
we're not because that's what
people know them for. But

375
00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:48.080
in terms of, of behaviors,
not unusual, I don't think.

376
00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:51.740
And then from Microsoft side
it makes perfect sense. They

377
00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:54.800
bought a whole logistic, you
know, delivery system. So they've

378
00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:58.760
a whole hardware delivery system
they've basically invested in. So

379
00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:02.060
it's not just a brand
and some foam models and

380
00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:06.080
some people it's a complete
company that knows how to

381
00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:10.190
deliver hardware into a global
marketplace. So I understand why

382
00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:15.140
they did that. And do
you think that that'll allow

383
00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:17.300
them to, to innovate faster?
I mean, is the idea

384
00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:18.670
that you'll be able to
come up with newer and

385
00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:23.090
more innovative designs? I don't
know. That's, that's a good

386
00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:27.560
question because obviously Nokia has
a ton of talented people.

387
00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:29.360
We've seen none of them,
you know, the devices that's

388
00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:33.350
come out of it. So
if, if Microsoft can leverage

389
00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:36.830
of that and improve on
it. Absolutely. Yeah. I hope

390
00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:38.960
so. I'd like to just
do some reconciliation of the,

391
00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:41.720
Of the, of the platform
and get it down to

392
00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:44.810
like, what's the flagship, like,
what's the ultimate like with,

393
00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:47.470
with an iPhone or with
an Android? I like, there's

394
00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:49.240
always that sense of like,
I just want the best

395
00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:53.410
Hmm. With, with windows phone,
I feel like the nine

396
00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:56.440
30, the 10 20 and
the 15, 20 are all

397
00:20:56.500 --> 00:21:00.630
the best for different reason.
That's right. Yeah. And I

398
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:04.290
think the nine 30 or
the, the icon is where

399
00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:08.520
they were headed with them
and it is I've, I've

400
00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:10.560
used it a couple of
times. It is an absolutely

401
00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:13.860
beautiful device it's got, I
don't know how to the

402
00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:17.160
screen on it is. I
often compare it to paper.

403
00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:19.230
I don't know if that's
it's a bit weird, but

404
00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:23.130
it just feels, yeah, I
dunno. It's really, really nice,

405
00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:26.100
but it doesn't have the
camera of the 10 20.

406
00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:27.840
This is really bothering you.
You brought that up a

407
00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:31.740
number of times. Not, it's
just not the thing is

408
00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:34.410
I would give up the
camera. It's still a fantastic

409
00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:36.720
camera. It's still an eight
megapixel plus camera. I think

410
00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:42.360
it's the 20 megapixel. Come
on. I know In AP

411
00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:44.280
screen though, that's what I
need. You know what I

412
00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:48.330
mean? I need the retina
screen. Exactly. And you will,

413
00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:50.910
you will get that. It's
coming to you to the,

414
00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:54.000
all the new Nokia devices
I'm sure is all written

415
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.990
there. What? 10 ADP, but
I don't know. I'll take

416
00:21:57.990 --> 00:22:00.750
a lot of photos. I
really enjoy the camera on

417
00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:03.660
the 10 20, the, and
I've done a couple of

418
00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:07.980
presentations where I display on
the showcase, the zoom on

419
00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:09.990
it. So you take a
picture and then zoom in

420
00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:12.690
on a particular feature and
people are just in awe

421
00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:16.470
because it's, there's nothing like
it. The demo that always

422
00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:19.440
blows people's minds is taking
a number plate or license

423
00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:21.510
plate photograph. You know, if
you're in a cafe and

424
00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:23.640
you just point at a
car and say, I'm going

425
00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:25.590
to take a picture of
that number plate from here

426
00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:27.840
and then, and then zoom
in and then try to

427
00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:30.480
have them do that on
my iPhone. It's funny. I'm

428
00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:33.780
sitting here teasing you about
the difference between 43 megapixels

429
00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:36.690
and 20. And I, and
I'm still using an iPhone,

430
00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:39.570
but I hate the camera
on this darn phone. Well,

431
00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:42.540
that might change because they've
just hired the top guy

432
00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:44.760
at Nakia. They did that
built the camera of the

433
00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:48.690
41 payment, maybe 60 cameras.
So hopefully something cool will

434
00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:50.730
come out of Apple from
that One other thing to

435
00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:55.260
compare between Apple and windows
phone is Siri versus Cortana.

436
00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:59.550
Yup. That's I don't know
if COVID, if people aren't

437
00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:03.240
familiar with Katana, it's a,
it's like Siri on steroids.

438
00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:09.330
It's, it's a convergence of
Siri and Google now Katana's

439
00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:13.830
can do stuff like it
can set up an appointment

440
00:23:13.890 --> 00:23:16.350
for say, you have a,
you need to buy him

441
00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:19.800
on flowers cause we all
do over. And then you

442
00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:23.460
say, okay, Katana, remind me
to buy, ask my mom

443
00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:25.980
about flowers. Next time I
talked to her, for example,

444
00:23:26.730 --> 00:23:29.580
and then what Catana does
is sets up a reminder,

445
00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:32.220
but the reminder will pop
up if you're texting your

446
00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:34.020
mom or if you're writing
her an email, or if

447
00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:36.210
you calling it, it'll pop
up and say, Oh, don't

448
00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:39.480
forget to ask him about
flowers. And that sort of

449
00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:42.660
contextual stuff is very cool.
And I haven't really seen

450
00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:45.620
that on any other platforms.
So on, on iPhone, they,

451
00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:48.410
they, they make A big
deal out of the, the

452
00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:52.490
geo fencing, contextual aspect of
things. So the, the killer

453
00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:55.190
feature is to say, remind
me to get milk when

454
00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:58.870
I leave Here, where you
hear that as well. But

455
00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:01.450
the idea of contextual in
the sense of whenever I

456
00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:06.760
interact with this other individual,
No it doesn't. And it's

457
00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:09.130
very useful. I've used it
a few times. Yeah. You

458
00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:11.050
know, it's almost, Oh, don't
forget to ask this person

459
00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:12.790
about that and go, all
right, I'll set a reminder.

460
00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:17.080
So whenever you interact with
that person, you'll actually remember

461
00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:19.540
to ask them, See, that's
something that I feel is

462
00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:22.840
an education issue. I feel
like, and this is just

463
00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:24.940
micro. I mean, I'm, I
am a Microsoft employee, but

464
00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:27.730
speaking just personally, I don't
think we do a great

465
00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:30.760
job of educating people on
these features. Like rather than,

466
00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:34.210
you know, music, videos and
commercials that are like that.

467
00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:38.950
I would like us to
have single tasked commercials that

468
00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:41.650
explain something, like, just show
me someone doing a real

469
00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:45.250
life situation. Like, you know,
call my wife and then

470
00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:47.440
calls my wife. Then I
hang up and I say,

471
00:24:47.890 --> 00:24:50.320
remind me to ask my
wife about getting the house

472
00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:52.920
painted. Next time I talked
to her, you know, that

473
00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:55.750
that's, these are very reasonable
things. But for someone who

474
00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:59.320
buys the phone at their
local telephone company, they're not

475
00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:02.020
really going to discover. Yeah.
They're not, they don't know.

476
00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:05.920
And that's, it's a beef
I've had with Microsoft marketing

477
00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:07.810
for a number of years.
Cause I seem to do

478
00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:11.470
all that for them. So,
because I obviously I've, I

479
00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:13.810
discovered this features cause I
can't put the phone down,

480
00:25:13.810 --> 00:25:18.070
I just keep using it.
So I agree. It's something

481
00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:22.930
that would pinpoint or highlight
hero features is very well

482
00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:26.830
received. Usually in my opinion
and the features. I like

483
00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:31.530
that. Yeah. Yeah. It's the
features that make the, the,

484
00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:37.360
the platform unique. So Katana's
also borrowed stuff from Google.

485
00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:40.660
Now, such as if you
have flights coming in through

486
00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:42.670
your email, it'll know about
them, it'll know how to

487
00:25:42.670 --> 00:25:45.670
read your email and it'll
remind you about your flight.

488
00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:47.710
It will set it up
on your calendar. It'll even

489
00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:50.860
track it for you. If
you want to all, without

490
00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:54.040
you having to do any
interaction at all. And these

491
00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:56.950
sorts of features, they will
pop up eventually. Cause people

492
00:25:56.950 --> 00:25:59.530
will notice, Oh, hang on.
This is something new. But

493
00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:02.800
the feature of, of reminding,
you know, contextual reminders to

494
00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:05.800
have contact, they're just, people
won't know unless you tell

495
00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:11.590
them. Huh? That's interesting. I,
I wonder if it's really,

496
00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:14.470
like you said, it's on
steroids, Siri on steroids. That's

497
00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:18.310
a bold step. Yeah. But
I think it is serious.

498
00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:22.270
Good. And it's certainly gotten
better, but they still, it's

499
00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:25.000
still very much a one
thing at a time as

500
00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:27.280
it's been my beef with
iOS, I had an iPhone

501
00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:28.720
for a couple of years
and I loved it. Cause

502
00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:32.080
it was awesome. But it,
then it never really moved

503
00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:34.900
from there. It still is
one thing at a time.

504
00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:38.110
So you send a text
message, then you go out

505
00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:40.270
to the store to the
start screen to choose another

506
00:26:40.270 --> 00:26:42.880
app. And it continues that
way. And it's the same

507
00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:45.860
with you. Ask it one
thing. Alright, done. You could

508
00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:50.100
do another thing on Katana.
You can say exactly. For

509
00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:53.100
example, in Australia, you have,
we use Celsius in America,

510
00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:56.730
use Fahrenheit. So if I
asked for the weather tomorrow,

511
00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:59.700
because Catana is only available
in the U S I've

512
00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:01.770
had to jiggle my phone
so that I can get

513
00:27:01.770 --> 00:27:04.920
it, but it tells me
the temperature in Fahrenheit. But

514
00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:07.620
then the next question I
can say, ah, Catana, show

515
00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:09.240
me that and give me
that in Celsius. And she

516
00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:13.260
knows what I mean, contextually
that I'm referring to when

517
00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:18.080
you say that that context
is kept. Yeah, exactly. That's

518
00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:20.630
nice. You know, it's funny.
I was in Canada. I

519
00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:23.090
happened to take my iPhone
up there and I noticed

520
00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:25.670
that when I, my wife
and I were arguing and

521
00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:29.630
we were asking the system
how tall a particular actor

522
00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:33.110
was. And it knew to
give me meters while I

523
00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:35.210
was in Canada. And then
later that day we went

524
00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:37.460
back over the border and
then it told me in

525
00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:40.130
feet and inches. That's nice.
Isn't it? That's the way

526
00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:43.790
it should be. Absolutely. It
should be contextual. Absolutely. That's

527
00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:49.040
cool. Yeah. That's it's technology
is meant to enhance and

528
00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:51.650
make our lives easier. Not,
you know, tearing our hair

529
00:27:51.650 --> 00:27:54.170
out, banging at stuff. The
trick is of course making

530
00:27:54.170 --> 00:27:58.070
it intuitive. One man's intuitive
is another person's completely unintuitive.

531
00:27:58.070 --> 00:28:01.760
So it all depends. Yup.
Yup. I've noticed that some

532
00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:04.250
of these systems, like someone
might argue, for example, that

533
00:28:04.790 --> 00:28:07.580
setting the region of the
device or the keyboard on

534
00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:10.730
the device would be the,
the reason that should do

535
00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:13.070
that. Not based on my
location. So being in Canada

536
00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:15.530
doesn't mean I want to
switch to meters if I'm

537
00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:20.180
an American in Canada. Yeah.
Well, yes and no, but

538
00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:23.300
you know, I'm a Danish
guy living in Australia, but

539
00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:26.810
I still want Danish keyboard
and Australian keyboard on my

540
00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:28.730
phone because I'll take my
mum and Danish, but I'd

541
00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:32.420
text my partner in Australia
or in English. So, you

542
00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:36.530
know, there's, there's different usage
scenarios for it, I guess.

543
00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:38.570
And when do you, when
do we think that windows

544
00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:40.400
8.1 is going to be
everywhere? Cause I know I

545
00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:42.350
put it on my wife's
machine just by downloading the

546
00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:48.380
developer preview application. I'm guessing.
Well the release support release

547
00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:51.650
cycle has been announced to
start on June 24. So

548
00:28:51.650 --> 00:28:54.230
that's when all of us
geeks of expecting it to

549
00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:57.530
be released. Well, that's pretty
cool. I'm looking forward to

550
00:28:57.530 --> 00:29:00.980
that. And I suppose it'll
probably be pushed out by

551
00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:04.040
different carriers on different devices
and it'll roll out over

552
00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:06.830
some number of months. Yeah.
It will usually take a

553
00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:09.950
few months. Depends on which
carry you on. Obviously if

554
00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:11.600
you bought a phone out,
right, you are not on

555
00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:15.110
any carrier, so you should
get it straight away. But

556
00:29:15.410 --> 00:29:17.960
yeah, it, it depends on
your local carrier, how fast

557
00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:19.910
they are to update all
of their crap where they

558
00:29:19.910 --> 00:29:24.170
put on it. I mean,
Yeah, indeed. Another couple apps

559
00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:26.510
and a couple other things
about the windows phone that,

560
00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:28.820
you know, just like they're
the calling. They kind of

561
00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:31.400
make me want to get
off my iPhone are things

562
00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:34.730
like driving mode. Have you
set that up? I did

563
00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:36.290
set it up and it
annoyed the hell out of

564
00:29:36.290 --> 00:29:38.810
me really, but it's a
good, yeah. I love that.

565
00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:41.200
It, I know back when
I'm on the phone, I

566
00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:44.560
love that. Yeah. Well it's
a good idea. It's just

567
00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:48.940
that I wouldn't use to
being aware that something's happened

568
00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:52.720
and suddenly it was completely
silent. So I just, I

569
00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:54.640
maybe I didn't get used
to it. I dunno. Yeah.

570
00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:56.530
I have heard of people
that really like it and

571
00:29:56.530 --> 00:29:58.600
it'll know text back and
say, Hey, I'm driving, I'll

572
00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:00.660
call you back. When I
want to stop. When both

573
00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:03.760
my parents saw my wife's
10, 20, and each of

574
00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:08.080
them bought one and my
dad particularly likes the texting

575
00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:09.970
you while I'm driving things.
So if, if he doesn't

576
00:30:09.970 --> 00:30:12.640
like talking on the phone
while he's driving, even though

577
00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:15.940
he has Bluetooth, so the
phone automatically texts me when

578
00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:18.280
he's driving and then we'll
remind him to call me,

579
00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:20.290
you know, when he stops
the car. And I think

580
00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:22.870
that's an exactly, that's another
perfectly good commercial they should

581
00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:27.160
do. Yes. It's another feature.
That's, it's a very simple

582
00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:29.830
feature and it doesn't take
you really any time to

583
00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:32.020
set up and then it
just works. But no one

584
00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:35.260
knows about it. Yeah, absolutely.
So people can learn more

585
00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:40.570
about Laura's at, about.me/large.clinton. I'll
put that on the show

586
00:30:40.570 --> 00:30:44.590
notes and then when your
Pluralsight course comes out, we'll

587
00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:47.680
put that up as well.
Lovely. Brilliant. Thanks so much

588
00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:49.990
for chatting with me today.
No worries. Thanks Scott. For

589
00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:53.260
having me. This has been
another episode of Hanselminutes and

590
00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:54.400
we'll see you again next
week.
