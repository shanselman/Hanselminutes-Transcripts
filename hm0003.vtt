<inaudible>. Hey, this is Carl

18
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.810
hope. You're having a good
Wednesday. I'm here with Scott

19
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.200
Hanselman on Hansel minutes. Hi
Scott. Hey Carl, how's it

20
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.620
going? Going well, what you
got for us this week?

21
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.800
Well, for the first half
of the show, I've got

22
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.690
a lot of stuff about
some software that has been

23
00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.660
on my mind lately, and
I've actually been fortunate enough

24
00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:57.980
to have a number of
people who've been listening to

25
00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.900
the show, send me a
tips and tricks and things

26
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.040
that I'm going to share
some of those as well.

27
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.270
Okay. So the first one
is actually an older tip.

28
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.250
A lot of people have
got IBM's and it seems

29
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.190
that the IBM T 42
ThinkPad has kind of become

30
00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.720
the laptop for the power
developer. Everyone loves it. It's

31
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.690
it's nice and sleek. It's
simple. It works. I'm pretty

32
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.330
happy with my <inaudible>, but
the one thing that everyone

33
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.110
knows sucks about the T
42 series is it's got

34
00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.080
no windows key and that's
just bug the heck out

35
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.860
of me. I blogged a
while back about how you

36
00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.950
can edit the windows registry
to like do a hardware

37
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.550
remapping. And I remapped my
right alt key to the

38
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.860
windows case. So I can
say right, all our for

39
00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.620
run and write all D
and for Explorer and all

40
00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.980
those kind of cool windows
shortcuts. Did you do that?

41
00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.900
Cause you find you don't
really use the right alt

42
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.260
T as an key. Yeah.
The only thing that sucks

43
00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.090
about using the right alt
key in this manner is

44
00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.460
that a shift right. All
to enter, which is typically

45
00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.200
the way that you jump
out of a full screen.

46
00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.680
Virtual PC doesn't work so
long as I don't go

47
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.350
full screen with my virtual
PCs. It's okay. But other

48
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.350
people could remap their caps
lock key or the right

49
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.240
shift, or, you know, one
of those buttons that there's

50
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.760
a, that's not being particularly
used. Right. I put that

51
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.870
up at shrinks.com/b as in
boy, E S Austin. I

52
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.000
ended up finding a better
one from a guy named

53
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.710
randy@andrandyranch.com slash sharp keys. And
he's got, I think called

54
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:24.310
sharp keys that will do
the editing of your registry

55
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.850
for you. Now, IBM has
some keyboard remapping stuff. That'll

56
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.680
do this. And there's been
a number of different tools.

57
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.920
Chris cells has got some
scan code remapping, but this

58
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.100
sharp keys from Randy rants.com
has actually been one of

59
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.160
the simpler tools for doing
this kind of keyboard remapping.

60
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.350
You can even use it
for things like neutering, your

61
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.480
caps lock key. Cause some
people just don't feel caps

62
00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.560
lock is useful for anything.
So you can Write a

63
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.260
program to hook that a
key and maybe turn it

64
00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.870
on and off if you
want to, if you need

65
00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.240
to. So the real question
is when you, when you

66
00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.210
write a keyboard hook in
windows, are you trying to

67
00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.120
catch it at the, the
message pump kind of windows

68
00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.650
is, is capturing keys on
a particular application at the,

69
00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.720
at the keyboard hook level
where windows is capturing it

70
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.330
for the hollow S or
the scan code remapping, which

71
00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.030
basically says to the keyboard
driver. No, no, you really

72
00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.120
didn't hear what you thought
you heard. This scan code

73
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.260
remapping is really the most
kind of authoritative, even in,

74
00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.560
even in crazy applications, Fullscreen
applications, you know, direct X

75
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.980
applications like Guild Wars. My
right old key is for

76
00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.050
all intents and purposes, my
windows key. So if you

77
00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.970
just handle a little more,
Yeah. If you handled the

78
00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.700
key down event or the
key press event in a

79
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.520
windows form or something good
chance, you might not get

80
00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.090
that. This is a little
more authoritative than that. This

81
00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.120
is a yeah. Very early
on in the process that

82
00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.760
gets set. Okay. Okay. So
I'm looking at the list

83
00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.120
and I see there's something
about a program called task

84
00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.540
switch X P What's that?
Well, this is actually a

85
00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.030
tool from the maker of
tasks, which XP a lot

86
00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.630
of people have always felt
that not enough information existed

87
00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.470
in the alt tab experience
in windows XP. So this

88
00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:06.390
particularGuy@ntwind.com who wrote task switch
XP that you can Google

89
00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:09.660
for. He's got a really
nice all tab replacement, but

90
00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.990
he's come out with another
thing. And kind of in

91
00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.810
the spirit of a screen
capture programs, which I mentioned

92
00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.410
last week, Kenny, care's a
window clippings. This particular guy

93
00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:22.130
has got a thing called
wind snap. And there's, there's

94
00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.630
a million different print screen
replacements out there. But I

95
00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.170
got to say that this
particular one's got some pretty

96
00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:34.050
interesting Polish to it. It's
a trickster.com/bet. And this guy

97
00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.020
has applied his kind of
own special style to it.

98
00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.720
I think he's convinced that
he's going to replace every

99
00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.240
hot key and windows. He's
replaced all tab. And I

100
00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.370
was replacing print screen. I'm
not really sure what's next.

101
00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.820
One of the neat things
about wind snap is that

102
00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:53.280
it will apply transformations to
your print screen and automatically

103
00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.660
add it to the clipboard.
So let's say that I

104
00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.000
want all my print screens
to be rotated 30 degrees

105
00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.950
to the left and have
a canvas drop shadow applied

106
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:03.200
to it. Or all of
my print screens have to

107
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.980
have a particular watermark that
says confidential or for your

108
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:10.250
eyes only, wow. This kind
of stuff would automate all

109
00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:12.320
of that and just apply
it directly to the print

110
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.790
screen button. Wow. That's pretty
cool. Yeah. Yeah. I was

111
00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:22.900
pretty impressed. I still like
the kind of classic intrusiveness

112
00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.630
that Kenny stuff has. You
basically hit a hot key,

113
00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:29.050
the screen dims out, you
hover over the, the, the

114
00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:31.660
window that you want. You
push a button and it's

115
00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.300
done. This guys is a
little more advanced in some

116
00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.550
of the things around rotating
and drop shattering can be

117
00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:38.680
pretty hardcore, but I can
definitely see if you were

118
00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.260
writing a book or doing
any kind of transformations that

119
00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.200
involve watermarking or rotating of
any kind of images. You

120
00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.360
know, why try to build
that into a batch process

121
00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:48.490
in a Photoshop when you
can have all of that

122
00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:51.810
done automatically by your print
screen program. Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

123
00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:54.400
It's pretty cool. And actually
within the context of photos,

124
00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:56.290
cause I know that you
take a lot of digital

125
00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:58.510
photos. Yeah. I got it.
Took a look at this

126
00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:04.030
group shot Microsoft research project,
which actually was a well-timed,

127
00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:05.620
you know, I had my
family over here when the

128
00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.530
baby was born. Most, most
family rather came over from

129
00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:12.430
Tanzania and we took a
lot of group photos. A

130
00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:13.930
lot of this kind of
put the camera up on

131
00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:16.570
the mantel, you know, set
it for 10 seconds and

132
00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:21.250
then run back. Yup. And
a lot of really bad

133
00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:23.770
pictures were taken. I remember
on the final day we

134
00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:26.260
took a group picture, I
think literally 10 times. And

135
00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.900
we just could not get,
you know, 17 people to

136
00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:32.350
smile at the same time.
So this group shot research

137
00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:40.540
project@shrinkstirdotcomslashbuisagashingupongod.net. And so Microsoft research
program that lets you take

138
00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:43.240
a series of photos that
were taken in quick succession,

139
00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:46.180
not like a Panorama, but
literally a group of people.

140
00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:48.580
We could actually use this
for the RDS. You know,

141
00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:51.310
we'd take pictures of 60
RDS at the PDC and

142
00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:53.890
the tech ed every year.
And you actually can pick

143
00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:57.040
which face of which person
you liked the best from

144
00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:00.370
which shot. And it will
automatically composite those into a

145
00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:02.830
group shot in which everyone
is smiling. Now, Scott, I

146
00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:05.650
went and I looked at
the Microsoft research page and

147
00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:08.410
I looked at the screenshots
and I think they may

148
00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:12.670
have done something wrong here
because the, the first picture,

149
00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:15.250
like all the pictures are
the same, except for the

150
00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:17.950
unwanted background noise, all the
pictures of the same. I

151
00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:20.770
think what they intended to
do is the first, the

152
00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:25.000
first shot, the woman isn't
smiling and the S or

153
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.460
the second shot, she isn't
smiling or something like that

154
00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:29.920
because you see, if you
look at the, the woman

155
00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:32.080
at the, on the top
tile and the first picture,

156
00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:35.140
she's not smiling. And on
the second one she is,

157
00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:38.470
you know, So they've taken,
they've taken two shots in

158
00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:40.900
succession. She happened to me,
not smiling in the first

159
00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:43.450
she was in the second.
Right. But the man looked

160
00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:45.790
better in the first. So
we composite them together into

161
00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:48.520
a picture in which they
are both smiling. Right. But

162
00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:51.760
unfortunately the demo pictures don't
reflect that, but that's, I

163
00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:55.120
think what they intended to
do. Yeah. That's yeah. That's

164
00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:57.120
the intent of the thing
is to find the optimal

165
00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.700
picture. So I actually went
back to this photos that

166
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:03.180
we took last month, took
these 17 photos of these,

167
00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:05.130
you know, 15 or 17
odd people. I don't remember

168
00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:07.170
if there was a lot
of us there and actually

169
00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:09.690
put together a composite photo
of all of us looking

170
00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:12.770
pretty good. Wow. That's not
something you'd want to share,

171
00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:17.060
obviously, personal photos, But this
is, this was something that,

172
00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:20.590
that people say that they'll
do a, you know, Oh,

173
00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:22.070
I'll, I'll go ahead and
put that in Photoshop. But

174
00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:23.570
you know, that's a real
hassle trying to get a

175
00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:26.720
really nice composite and Photoshop,
you know, it can be

176
00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.340
really tricky and it's certainly
not something that you're going

177
00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:31.550
to do lightly, but I
think a research project, like

178
00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:34.310
this is actually a harbinger
of something to come where

179
00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:37.130
you might see something like
that in Picasa remember a

180
00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:40.430
few years back red eye
reduction was an amazing, Oh

181
00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:43.520
my God, they've removed red
eye, but now what application

182
00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:46.670
doesn't have red eye reduction.
And you know, the thing

183
00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:48.800
that immediately comes to mind
is this can be used

184
00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.780
for more than just group
shots of people. I mean,

185
00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.210
any kind of composite thing
that you want to do,

186
00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:56.540
you know, if you're taking
pictures of the same thing

187
00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:58.310
over and over again, and
you want to take individual

188
00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:01.190
pieces of different things. Very
cool. Hey Scott, I was

189
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:03.380
reading your blog this weekend
and I noticed that you,

190
00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:07.700
you did it, this really
complete discussion of XF and

191
00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:11.930
geocashing and, and mashups. Are
you going to talk about

192
00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:15.890
that today? Sure. I'm actually
just been getting into this

193
00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:17.180
in the last couple of
weeks and there are a

194
00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:18.680
lot of people out there
doing a lot of stuff.

195
00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:20.540
So I'm not in any
way an expert in this

196
00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:25.700
kind of stuff, but JPEGs
can carry what's called EXIF

197
00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:28.670
data. E X I F
it's data. That's like metadata

198
00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:32.300
that comes along for the
ride. Most cameras do this

199
00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:34.610
and you don't realize it.
I didn't even realize that

200
00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:37.670
my camera was actually saying
things like the focal length

201
00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:41.180
of the lens and what
the ISO was set out

202
00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:43.490
at the time, what the
white balance was set at

203
00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:46.130
all sorts of bits of
information. You wonder sometimes is

204
00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:49.460
it valuable? Should I put
the date time stamp on

205
00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:51.350
my digital camera? A lot
of our digital cameras are

206
00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:55.370
all set to January 1st, 2000. When
you put that information on

207
00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:58.250
your camera, it gets written
out into tags within your

208
00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:02.960
JPEGs, which allows tools like
Picasa and different image manipulation

209
00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:05.990
programs to know about the
context in which that this

210
00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:08.120
was written. That's very cool.
So if you look at

211
00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:11.080
exit data as a place
to store additional metadata and

212
00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:14.270
additional context about your photographs,
you know, what was the

213
00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:17.330
camera doing? What time was
it? Yeah. What other bits

214
00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:23.210
of information could you potentially
potentially store these XF tags?

215
00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:26.240
Actually remind me of gift
comments. I don't know how

216
00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:29.360
old school my, my audience
is, but when gifts gift

217
00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:32.330
87 had an extension which
was gift comments and people

218
00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:34.100
would put in the name
of the bulletin board system

219
00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:36.590
that they downloaded a particular
gift on. So poor man's

220
00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:39.860
metadata. Basically they just shoved
by, you know, shoved textual

221
00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:41.300
data at the end of
a gift and ignored it.

222
00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:46.760
But X if is a
formalized standard. So you can

223
00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:49.310
take this exit data and
put anything that you want

224
00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:53.740
in there. So my buddy
Patrick Caldwell, does this called geo

225
00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:56.170
caching. Have you done this
before? No, I haven't heard

226
00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:59.200
of this. So geocashing is
a thing that started out

227
00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:05.890
in Portland where someone takes
a GPS somewhere. Yeah. Like

228
00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:08.920
a treasure hunt kind of
thing. Right? So geocashing is

229
00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:10.780
like a treasure hunt, but
it also has a series

230
00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:14.590
of associated rules, a protocol
with it where people aren't

231
00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:17.020
going to be stealing the
caches that they find they're

232
00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:18.880
not going to be messing
with it. There's kind of

233
00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:23.230
an honor amongst the geocaches
code. That goes on a

234
00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:25.300
lot. Like, it's kinda like
the end of the Shawshank

235
00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:27.820
redemption when Morgan Freeman goes
out into the middle of

236
00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:30.040
that field and he finds
the rock that doesn't belong

237
00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:32.920
anywhere on this earth. Great.
Fine. If he had a

238
00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:35.110
GPS that would have been
a geocashing right. He would

239
00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:36.790
have signed his name. He
would leave left all that

240
00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:38.800
money and he would have
gone to Zihuatanejo without it.

241
00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:43.060
Great movie. I love that.
Oh yeah. That's just one

242
00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:44.590
of those shows. It's always
on T and T, but

243
00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:46.480
when it's on, you have
to stop everything you're doing

244
00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:49.600
and watch it from whatever
point exactly it started. So

245
00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:54.580
geocashing involves this GPS using
GPS is to find stuff,

246
00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:57.610
but if you went out
with a camera out into

247
00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:00.040
the boonies and went hiking
and do things that people

248
00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:03.580
with digital cameras do, what,
if you could tag your

249
00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:06.040
photos, not only with the
date and what the camera

250
00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:07.690
was doing and the focal
length of the camera, but

251
00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:10.960
also where you were exactly
when that picture was taken.

252
00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:14.170
Wow. I found this flower
at this exact longitude and

253
00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:17.350
latitude. Wow. So there's a
series of tools that you

254
00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:20.620
can get. Robo geo is
one. So you go out

255
00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:24.010
with a $99 GPS and
you have it keep track

256
00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:25.480
and you have to make
sure that your camera and

257
00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:28.330
your GPS are time synchronized.
Because what you're going to

258
00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:30.370
do is you're going to
take all the way points

259
00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:33.340
from your GPS and all
of your photos that'll have

260
00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:35.830
the right time and coated
in them. You'll actually write

261
00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:39.850
out the GPS, coordinates into
the JPEGs without actually modifying

262
00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:43.180
the JPEG image. So it's
a lossless right? Then you

263
00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:44.920
can take these and you
can put them up on

264
00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:49.000
like flicker, the photo sharing.
There's a thing called mapper,

265
00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:53.590
M a ppr.com that can
take geotagged photos from flicker

266
00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:56.980
and then lay them out
over a flash interface. There's

267
00:13:56.980 --> 00:14:00.880
other tools from geo blogger
and G map track that

268
00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:05.170
will take Google maps, a
bunch of flicker photos or

269
00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:10.300
X, if I'm geocoded or
geotagged, it's called geotagged photos

270
00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:12.430
and overlay them. So you
can say, not only did

271
00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:15.130
I go on a trip,
I went hiking. Here's the

272
00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:18.550
exact route that I went
here are the flowers, bugs

273
00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:21.100
animals that I saw on
the way and exactly where

274
00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:23.500
they are. I would also
like to see what direction

275
00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:26.290
you were facing. That's a
really interesting point that can

276
00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:29.500
be taken from the GPS
too. I'm sure. So it

277
00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:32.080
turns out that it really,
really can't, unless you take

278
00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:35.860
the, the record before you,
and then determined that you

279
00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:39.610
were headed in a certain
direction, but figuring out orientation

280
00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:42.310
and then coming up with
a pie wedge indicating what

281
00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:45.610
direction the camera was facing
is actually trickier. Wow. Then

282
00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:49.030
you think, yeah, there's actually
different ways to do that.

283
00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:52.100
And I posted this on
my blog and a guy

284
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:55.100
named rich B PO pointed
me to a Ricoh camera.

285
00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:58.010
That's a lower end 3.2
mega pixel, but it has

286
00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:01.340
a compact flashlight. You can
actually plug a GPS into

287
00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:04.010
the bottom of the camera
and get automatically geo and

288
00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:09.290
coded photo. We all have
cameras that have this kind

289
00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:12.350
of stuff built in, like
for camera phones. But, you

290
00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:14.390
know, I don't think we're
very far away from a

291
00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:18.200
really nice snapshot in your,
in your front pocket, six

292
00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:21.800
megapixel camera with built in
geocoding. And that really means

293
00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:24.610
that some, some interesting stuff
can start getting done. Wow.

294
00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:27.220
That's very cool. Great. Okay.
Well, this is a good

295
00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:29.140
place to pause for a
minute and we'd like to

296
00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:31.300
remind our listeners and I'm
sure you would like to

297
00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:33.400
remind them as well this
too, please listen to the

298
00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:37.420
sponsor ad because without our
sponsors, this show would not

299
00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:40.600
be possible. So we'll be
right back after this important

320
00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:23.740
it and adds a new
test, complete test type. So

321
00:17:24.070 --> 00:17:27.700
do yourself a favor and
download a free evaluation copy

322
00:17:28.090 --> 00:17:44.470
of test complete@automatedqa.com. And we're
back with Scott Hanselman, I'm

323
00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:46.960
Carl Franklin, and you're listening to
the Hanselman it's show. Number

324
00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:50.700
three, Scott. We were just
talking EXIF and geo Caching

325
00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:52.890
and mashups and all the
stuff that you can do

326
00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:56.520
with that. Anything else on
that topic before we move

327
00:17:56.520 --> 00:18:00.140
on? You know, I'm just,
I'm still learning about this,

328
00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:02.060
but one of the things
that's really interesting if you

329
00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:04.850
take the concept of a
mashup, which is when you

330
00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:07.970
take a mapping service like
Google maps or virtual earth,

331
00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:10.940
and you mess with it's
JavaScript and the data is

332
00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:13.940
very, very transparent. You can
get at whatever you want.

333
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:17.390
You take something simple, like,
like tagging of data, you

334
00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:20.060
know, saying, Oh yeah, the
latitude was this. The longitude

335
00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:23.750
was that. And then things
like RSS and all this

336
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:27.470
metadata being passed around, even
though it doesn't feel very,

337
00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:30.260
very pretty or very structured,
it's not the kind of

338
00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:32.930
wonderful XML based future that
we thought it would be.

339
00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:36.320
The, the fact that it's
working, the fact that people

340
00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:39.680
are doing interesting things with
this is, is kind of,

341
00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:42.680
it's kind of overwhelming. Sometimes
I get frustrated like, wow,

342
00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:44.450
I really thought this would
be a lot cleaner. I

343
00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:46.190
thought we'd have schema for
all this. And we'd have

344
00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:49.760
formalized metadata. And people are
really shoving this data wherever

345
00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:52.490
they, they think they can.
I mean, flicker doesn't support

346
00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:56.180
geotagging in intrinsically or it
didn't when people started adding

347
00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:59.720
tags, flicker said, upload some
photos and put some veteran,

348
00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:02.750
you know, some tags here,
right? Look flour. Then show

349
00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:05.040
me all the pictures that
are tagged flour, right. Then

350
00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:08.210
someone decides to go and
say, geo colon latitude equals

351
00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:10.820
whatever. And then they start
sucking the data out with

352
00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:14.480
an open source API and
RSS API, and a flicker.

353
00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:16.670
And someone else says, Oh,
I'll slap that on a

354
00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:20.360
map. And then stuff starts
getting done. The there's a

355
00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:23.330
certain beauty in the happiness
of it all. Yeah. And

356
00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:25.880
speaking of hacking, there's some,
there's an item here in

357
00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:27.380
the world of Mac and
Linux. You want to lay

358
00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:30.350
on us, right? Everyone's talking
about this Intel core duo

359
00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:33.890
the whole Intel on Mac
Mac Tel, you know, people

360
00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:36.890
say wind and others saying
Mac tell, you know, it's

361
00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:39.320
a real coup for Intel.
I mean, these guys are

362
00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:41.600
selling chips to anybody and
then they don't care. I

363
00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:44.480
never thought I'd see the
day personally. I thought that

364
00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:47.930
Microsoft had a Intel pretty
much locked down, but I

365
00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:50.660
think it's actually a great
thing. A lot of people

366
00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:53.000
have been talking about, well,
now that I can run

367
00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:57.500
OS X or S 10
on Intel, can I run

368
00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:00.890
this on my T 42?
It, that you've been able

369
00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:03.950
to do this for a
while. There's been these developer

370
00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:07.340
drops of versions of the
Macco S that'll run on

371
00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:11.060
Intel for a while. And
actually there's a number of

372
00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:14.000
websites that I've got information
about this one of which

373
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:19.610
being OSX 86 project.org, which
is a news site dedicated

374
00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:23.630
to all things related to
getting max running on Intel.

375
00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:26.900
And there's even how to
guides and how to get

376
00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:30.230
your T 42 to dual
boot with max OSX. We've

377
00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:33.860
got one up@shrinkstir.com slash B
as in boy, E Z,

378
00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:36.830
Z for Zed. This guy's
got a step by step,

379
00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:39.350
how to get dual booting
to work a little partition,

380
00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:42.200
magic, a little crazy stuff.
These are all kind of

381
00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:45.500
hacked together, but they're really
letting us see a future

382
00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:48.490
where a lot of people
could potentially dual boot between

383
00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:52.270
these. I think that's interesting.
And we'll talk a little

384
00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:54.490
bit more about it, but
it doesn't this mean more

385
00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:58.150
and more that we could
have virtual PCs and Mac.

386
00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:00.910
There's a lot. I've seen
video of people hibernating their

387
00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:05.260
windows box booting into the
<inaudible> and then switching back,

388
00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:07.380
That's attractive to me, but
the idea that I could

389
00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:12.390
potentially run A Mac on
windows inside of a VM,

390
00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:14.320
that seems like a pretty
interesting thing. I think we'll

391
00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:18.450
see that soon. Interestingly, there's
a guy who who's put

392
00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:21.150
up on a website called
Winex P on Mac, a

393
00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:23.280
bounty. He's actually going to
pay you if you can

394
00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:28.110
get windows XP running on
his Mac. He's I think

395
00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:31.020
it's up to $4,800 right
now. He'll send that up.

396
00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:34.500
Yeah. And when people are
talking about getting Vista windows

397
00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:38.250
Vista to work on the
Mac, but there's an article

398
00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:42.870
up at ARS Technica shrink,
stir.com/b E Y about why

399
00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:45.510
this is never gonna work.
And a buddy of mine,

400
00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:48.240
Phil Lewis pointed me to
this and it makes complete

401
00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:53.940
sense. These new Macs don't
have bios the bios, the

402
00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:56.520
basic input output stuff, right.
And the underlying CMOs where

403
00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:58.500
these things get stored. Yeah.
You sorta need that. Is

404
00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:01.380
that it's an underlying kind
of little low S it's

405
00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:03.720
the little micro S they
don't have a bias because

406
00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:06.720
the bias is a really
old, outdated thing, but, but

407
00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:10.230
Intel's never been able to
toss it until now. So

408
00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:13.980
they've updated that with this
new technology called EFI, it's

409
00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:21.570
up at intel.com/technology/efi or shrink
stir.com/btex EFI, replaces the bios

410
00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:25.740
and actually puts a lot
of that bios on us

411
00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:30.420
onto the operating system. So
this is an extensible firmware

412
00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:34.110
interface. That's EFI that is
in these first Intel max.

413
00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:36.630
That really is an updated
bio specification that lets the

414
00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:40.530
vendor in this case, you
know, Vista or the Mac

415
00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:44.580
OS have operating system, independent
drivers that are really going

416
00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:46.260
to live in the hardware.
So you're actually going to

417
00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:50.100
have drivers for the basic
instruction set of your particular

418
00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:55.860
machine built in and basically
flashed into the device. So

419
00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:57.840
you're not going to be
able to get Vista to

420
00:22:57.990 --> 00:23:01.260
work on a Mac because
all of the EFI stuff

421
00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:03.450
that says, hi, I'm Vista,
and I know how to

422
00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:07.860
talk to your Mac, right?
Isn't in there anymore. That

423
00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:10.110
will possibly be in there.
They could certainly add that

424
00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:13.110
stuff. I mean, Microsoft wants
to get their operating system

425
00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:15.810
running everywhere. So I don't
think that we're going to

426
00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:19.170
see any, any pissing contest
where someone says, well, gosh,

427
00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:21.990
I don't want Macs running
on T 40 twos. And

428
00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:27.000
Microsoft says, I don't want
Vista running on, on, on

429
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.640
max. People want to sell
their software. It sort of

430
00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:32.610
makes sense that the operating
system is tuned to the

431
00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:35.070
platform that it's on. Right.
I mean, even if you

432
00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:37.560
could get it running, would
it be the best platform

433
00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:41.010
for it? Probably not. So
that's a very good point.

434
00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:43.110
Yeah. It's a very good
point because right now the

435
00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:47.540
<inaudible> stuff that I've seen,
Macko S tan, the wireless

436
00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:50.900
as a bit dodgy, the
graphic support just kind of

437
00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:53.080
got to where it needed
to be. It's more like

438
00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:55.720
a, just a challenge. I
like the option, but at

439
00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:57.190
this point, you're right. It
is a challenge. I mean,

440
00:23:57.190 --> 00:23:59.620
if someone thought they could
get <inaudible>, you know, running

441
00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:01.840
on their PSP, I mean,
I've seen people who have

442
00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:06.040
<inaudible> running in an emulator
on, on a PlayStation, portable,

443
00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:08.770
you know, and of course,
then they'll get another emulator

444
00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:10.870
running within that and they'll
get that running doom. And

445
00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:12.430
then they'll want to do
a death match with somebody

446
00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:16.030
on a, on a cell
phone. But, you know, doom

447
00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:18.310
is right. The, the, the
kind of the ultimate thing,

448
00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:21.820
whatever, whatever thing that you've
got, that is hackable. We'll

449
00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:25.270
get doom running on it.
Yeah. Right. But you're right.

450
00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:26.980
It's totally a challenge. They
just try, they like to

451
00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:29.860
jump through the hoops and
that's, that's cool. I support

452
00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:33.850
that. I'm pretty excited about
the possibilities though. And so

453
00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:36.400
let's talk about this, a
portrait of a kite.com. I

454
00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:40.780
went to this on your
recommendation and I, well, I'm,

455
00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:44.020
I'm blown away. What? It's
bizarre, isn't it? What is

456
00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:47.860
the, I have no words.
What am I looking at

457
00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:52.420
here? Yeah. This guy, portrait
of a kite.com has taken

458
00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:56.620
his site and completely skinned
it to look exactly like

459
00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:58.270
a Mac. Now, I don't
mean that he took a

460
00:24:58.270 --> 00:25:00.280
bunch of static pictures and
he made some curves and

461
00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:03.730
some CSS, but literally he
boots up a little pretend

462
00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:08.260
Mac simulator inside of your
browser. You can double click

463
00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:10.450
on the hard drive. You
can check the menus, you

464
00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:12.970
can load the sticky notes,
roll your mouse over the

465
00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:15.820
dock at the bottom, just,
just hover the mouse over.

466
00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:20.650
It actually shrinks and grows
as, I mean, it's crazy.

467
00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:24.130
It's all Ajax. All the
HTML. The whole thing is

468
00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:27.040
actually a showcase site for
a thing called I think

469
00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:32.320
it's called a kite OSX.
Yeah. It's basically a, a,

470
00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:35.190
a big at your own
risk. I don't recommend anyone

471
00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:37.540
do this, but you can
download his stuff. And it's

472
00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:41.290
a whole collection of all
the different themes and skins

473
00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:45.070
and scanners that you could
use to make your windows

474
00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:49.510
system look exactly like a
Mac. It's a collection of

475
00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:52.840
all this it's object, doc
it's window blinds. It's skins

476
00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:56.110
for Microsoft MSN messenger. It's
everything. You look at a

477
00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:59.410
screenshot section. It will make
your PC other than the

478
00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:02.140
fact that you've got internet
Explorer and the windows XP,

479
00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:04.960
internet Explorer, icon look exactly
like a Mac. It'll put

480
00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:07.600
a menu at the top.
It'll give you a doc.

481
00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:09.820
It'll give you the trashcan.
It'll give you an about

482
00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:13.420
this Mac menu. It actually
goes into some of your

483
00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:16.990
system DLLs and actually patches
some of the icons so

484
00:26:16.990 --> 00:26:20.410
that when windows in Explorer
goes to paint certain things,

485
00:26:20.410 --> 00:26:23.920
it will get the Mac
icon. Instead. It's pretty hardcore.

486
00:26:24.010 --> 00:26:25.810
It is very hard core.
I had, I had a

487
00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:28.990
strange bug, a problem with
this site in internet Explorer,

488
00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:31.810
I'm, I'm running and I'm
pretty high. I'm actually running

489
00:26:31.810 --> 00:26:34.660
a dual monitor, set up
with different resolutions in each

490
00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:36.400
monitor. And I wonder if
that doesn't have something to

491
00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:39.190
do with it, but, but
it did work in Firefox.

492
00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:42.670
So, and you don't have
any problems with internet Explorer.

493
00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:46.230
Don't, don't seem To, but
it's possible. You know, I

494
00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:47.820
should recommend people try it
and in a, in a

495
00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:51.240
either browser and give it
a try, but I'm running

496
00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:53.910
the site. Of course won't
hurt your machine downloading and

497
00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:56.760
installing his stuff. That's definitely
something that you would want

498
00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:58.360
to do on a throw
away a machine. Yeah. But

499
00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:01.130
it is kind of a
kick. Very, very cool. So

500
00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:05.240
is this the only OS
that people can choose OSX?

501
00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:08.930
What about that other operating
system that has a penguin

502
00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:12.830
associated with it? Well, Linux,
I think is really coming

503
00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:15.380
up on the desktop size
and on the desktop side

504
00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:18.110
of things I've been using
this Linux called Uber boon

505
00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:21.860
to Linux Boone, to UBU
N T U Linux dot

506
00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:25.910
or go Boone. Two's a
Zulu word. That means humanity

507
00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:31.340
towards other, toward humanity, towards
others@ubuntulinux.org. You can download this.

508
00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:34.820
Interestingly, there's a live CD.
And I recommend that everyone

509
00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:36.980
try this, download the live
CD from a boon to

510
00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:40.250
linux.org. If you don't have
a fast connection, they'll mail

511
00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:42.560
you the CD for free.
Wow. You can boot off

512
00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:45.080
of it. And it'll boot
up a complete version of

513
00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:48.020
Linux on your system without
touching your C drive and

514
00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:51.390
let you try it out.
People are calling this the

515
00:27:51.410 --> 00:27:54.890
third world desktop. And even
though the term third world

516
00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:58.130
is sometimes disparaged as being
not a very appropriate and

517
00:27:58.130 --> 00:28:03.170
kind word for machines in
countries that are maybe not

518
00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:05.960
the latest penny and four,
and not the latest. Andy,

519
00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:08.660
I personally have been able
to bring a lot of

520
00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:12.200
really old laptops back to
life with wound tool annex.

521
00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:15.710
I took a whole series
of Pentium three low, low

522
00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:20.210
end Pentium 3d Dells, 128
megs of Ram, 256 major

523
00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:24.020
Ram small four gig, eight
gig hard drives, and really

524
00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:27.890
brought them back to usefulness
with UConn to Linux slapped

525
00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:30.230
in a <inaudible> credit card
and got that thing on

526
00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:34.190
the network. Automatic update, complete
working desktop copies of a

527
00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:38.930
word and Excel clone via
open office. Firefox chat sent

528
00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:42.620
them off to Zimbabwe, to
South Africa. Wow, absolutely thrilled. If

529
00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:44.270
you've got an old machine
and you want to give

530
00:28:44.270 --> 00:28:46.550
it to the kids, there's
a version of a boon

531
00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:50.120
to, for children called edgy
boon to it's all loaded

532
00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:54.530
preloaded with educational software for
kids from kindergarten through 12,

533
00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:56.660
we just can't say enough.
Nice things. We have to

534
00:28:56.660 --> 00:28:58.340
do another whole show on
it one day. No, I

535
00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:00.530
haven't been keeping up with
Linux, but the last I

536
00:29:00.530 --> 00:29:02.720
knew it was still a
little bit tweaky to get

537
00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:05.240
stuff up and running. It
sounds like they've worked a

538
00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:07.820
lot of the kinks out
drivers are not an issue

539
00:29:08.930 --> 00:29:12.590
To be better and better.
A USB works, USB keys.

540
00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:15.020
You just plug them in
and they're automatically mounted, huh?

541
00:29:15.410 --> 00:29:17.930
People are calling a boon
to Linux Linux for human

542
00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:21.830
beings. Huh? Wow. They've got
an automatic updater. I actually

543
00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:26.150
updated the complete operating system
from their last April release

544
00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:29.150
to their last October release.
Wow. I may have to

545
00:29:29.150 --> 00:29:32.150
check it out. Very cool.
The live CD makes it

546
00:29:32.150 --> 00:29:34.010
really easy to check out
without having to worry about

547
00:29:34.010 --> 00:29:36.770
hurting your machine. Does it
work on a virtual PC?

548
00:29:37.970 --> 00:29:39.680
I mean, it does. You
can install it with a

549
00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:42.280
virtual PC. There are some
rules and some downloads. If

550
00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:44.440
you do a search for
a FAQ on how to

551
00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:46.690
install a boon too, there's
some tricks you need to

552
00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:49.210
do to make sure that
it supports the virtual PC

553
00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:52.450
virtual VGA driver. But once
you get that, you're totally

554
00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:55.270
set. I really recommend the
live stuff. If you just

555
00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:59.640
boot off the CD works
great. Right? Excellent. Onto the

556
00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:02.010
bugs. What you got for
us this week in bug

557
00:30:02.010 --> 00:30:05.310
land. Wow. We had some
pretty cool stuff going on

558
00:30:05.310 --> 00:30:07.200
over at curly. And I
posted about this. I think

559
00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:11.730
just yesterday, you know, XSLT
is kind of where it

560
00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:14.730
all happens. It's, it's become
kind of the scripting language

561
00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:18.420
does your for, for major
data transformation. It's just like

562
00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:22.110
Pearl likes to suck through
text files. People are using

563
00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:26.460
XSLT to make major transformations
in their XML data. And

564
00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:28.240
we had a big one.
We had a big 200

565
00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:32.790
5,300 Meg file shows up
every day, little two K

566
00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:36.150
three K XSLT needs to
transform this 300 Meg file.

567
00:30:36.330 --> 00:30:40.290
But it was written three
years ago. We used ms.

568
00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:43.200
XSL. It's a little command
line utility you can download

569
00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:47.340
from Microsoft. That's a front
end on the ms. XML

570
00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:50.940
Dom. And it was crashing.
Our file was getting so

571
00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:52.980
large that we were actually
running out of memory and

572
00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:57.000
getting a memory exception. So
then we switched over to

573
00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.560
using the.net stuff. We used
old Lake GenCos and XSLT,

574
00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:04.590
which is a front end
command line that talks to

575
00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:07.860
the.net XSLT stuff. The nice
thing about this is that

576
00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:10.440
it's command line compatible, which
means all the switches that

577
00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:13.560
we're used to using with
MSX SSL, the, the old

578
00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:16.620
comm based one, you've used
this in VB VB six,

579
00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:19.320
right? Add, well, you know,
add reference XML. There was

580
00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:23.850
version three, version four and
XSLT has got command line

581
00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:27.540
switch compatibility with the, a,
the comm stuff. But our,

582
00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:29.910
our memory was kind of
leveling out about a gig

583
00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:32.490
and it was taking, you
know, 10, 15 minutes to

584
00:31:32.490 --> 00:31:35.010
do this. Well, we had
some guys take a look

585
00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:37.110
at this. And the style
sheet was really written like

586
00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:39.090
a little program. You know,
if you've written an extra

587
00:31:39.090 --> 00:31:42.390
cell style sheet yourself, You
know, I've stayed clear away

588
00:31:42.390 --> 00:31:46.230
from XSLT seeing is I
don't like to spend a

589
00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:50.640
lot of time tweaking, tweaking
textiles. Yeah. It's pretty crazy.

590
00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:53.580
Most people want to sit
down and write these things

591
00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:56.370
like their little programs. There's
a four H there's variables.

592
00:31:56.370 --> 00:31:59.730
You can call functions with
parameters. So we wrote this

593
00:31:59.730 --> 00:32:03.150
kind of little program, but
it turned out that that

594
00:32:03.150 --> 00:32:07.350
wasn't the way XSLT wanted
to work. Your input document

595
00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:10.590
has a series of elements
that you want to match

596
00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:12.750
on. Let's say you've got
an input document. That's got

597
00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:16.230
a root. No, that says
books. And you've got book,

598
00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:19.470
book, book, book, book, a
programmer would typically write something

599
00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:23.580
like for each book in
books. Right. Do some stuff

600
00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:26.730
with XSLT. They don't think
about things like that. They

601
00:32:26.730 --> 00:32:29.850
want you to say, write
up a template that is

602
00:32:29.850 --> 00:32:33.840
the handler for books and
all automatically call it when

603
00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:36.930
I see a book go
by. Does that make sense?

604
00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:41.930
Yeah. So we rewrote the
style sheet. Actually, a Andy

605
00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:45.770
Phoenix did over the weekend
and to, to see if

606
00:32:45.770 --> 00:32:48.740
he could get it working,
he rewrote it, it became

607
00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:51.860
a little smaller. It became
a lot simpler to understand

608
00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:54.710
because each element that we
were handling had a template

609
00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:58.520
set up to handle it.
So this, this style sheet

610
00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:01.070
by just changing the style
sheet from being very procedural,

611
00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:02.990
to being very declarative, we
went from a 10 minute

612
00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:08.030
run to being a, a
three minute run. Wow, cool.

613
00:33:08.150 --> 00:33:12.020
So here's the interesting thing
though. This new improved XSLT,

614
00:33:12.170 --> 00:33:17.420
when run under.net one.one didn't
improve at all. We had

615
00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:20.240
better memory usage, but it
still took 10 minutes. We

616
00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:24.100
ended up going back to
the old combat stuff. So

617
00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:27.140
I dug into this turns
out that the real hardcore

618
00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:31.910
XSL guys who use Microsoft
still use this ms. XML

619
00:33:31.910 --> 00:33:34.640
for, they like really feel
that this is the best

620
00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:40.160
XSLT processor for performance. It's
unmanaged code. It's calm, but

621
00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:43.700
it's wicked fast. And the
dotnet one, one XSLT processor

622
00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:46.790
was really not very well
thought of I had no

623
00:33:46.790 --> 00:33:50.990
idea. Right? So you started,
yeah. So, so I said,

624
00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:52.520
well, this can't be the
case. I've heard so much

625
00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:54.530
great things about dotnet to,
Oh, I gotta check this

626
00:33:54.530 --> 00:33:57.500
out. So I went up
to O'Lakes site and I

627
00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:01.190
got an XSLT to the
dotnet to O version that

628
00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:04.430
fronts all the new stuff.
Now the XSLT processor has

629
00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:08.480
been completely rewritten in dotnet
to, Oh, I was actually

630
00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:11.300
fortunate enough to have a
gentleman named Michael Brundage who

631
00:34:11.930 --> 00:34:15.800
reads my blog post about
this. He was actually on

632
00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:17.720
that team and came up
with a lot of these

633
00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:22.820
techniques and indicated to me
that Chris Suber, who works

634
00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:27.260
at Amazon, got the ball
rolling on these major improvements,

635
00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:31.250
as well as Helena <inaudible>
who rewrote the XML, parsers,

636
00:34:31.850 --> 00:34:35.360
all of this work being
done in XSLT for dotnet

637
00:34:35.390 --> 00:34:39.350
to, Oh, we ran the
new XSLT. The whole thing

638
00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:44.810
happened in 59 seconds. Oh
my God. 10 times faster

639
00:34:44.990 --> 00:34:48.290
on dotnet to, Oh, wow.
I, I mean, I couldn't,

640
00:34:48.290 --> 00:34:50.300
I mean, I literally couldn't
believe it. I wonder if

641
00:34:50.590 --> 00:34:52.600
I wonder if biz talk
is driving any of that

642
00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:55.000
because you know, a big
part of the, the appeal

643
00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.900
of BizTalk is the XSLT
transformer, whatever they call it.

644
00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:01.100
I'm not even sure what
they call it, but Yeah,

645
00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:03.220
I don't know. But I
do know this though. I

646
00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:05.950
installed SQL server express recently,
and I know you've know

647
00:35:05.950 --> 00:35:10.600
you've done that. It actually
installs ms. XML six, the

648
00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:14.470
unmanaged comm based stuff, and
the four XML, you know,

649
00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:17.740
you say like select star
from books for XML auto

650
00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:23.110
that apparently still using the
unmanaged code, the, the ms.

651
00:35:23.110 --> 00:35:26.230
XML six, and you can
go up to my blog

652
00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:27.910
and read about how I
actually kind of took this

653
00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:30.130
to the next level and
took the source code for

654
00:35:30.130 --> 00:35:32.770
ms. XSL and kind of
rewrote it a little bit

655
00:35:32.770 --> 00:35:36.730
to, to use the new
ms. XML six stuff, and

656
00:35:36.730 --> 00:35:39.840
found that I did get
a, a five X improvement,

657
00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:42.870
but didn't get that dramatic
improvement until I switched over

658
00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:45.780
to dotnet to, Oh, either
way for people who are

659
00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:48.750
doing XSLT, there are good
things coming. And if you

660
00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:53.430
are doing some really hardcore
xslt.net two, Oh, wicked fast,

661
00:35:53.490 --> 00:35:56.160
wicked fast, great, fantastic stuff.
And if you're a comm

662
00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:58.830
programmer and you're doing VB
six, you've got some PB

663
00:35:58.830 --> 00:36:02.640
six legacy code. Take a
look at ms. XML six,

664
00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:07.440
you can download the SDK
for change your prog IDs

665
00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:10.170
to point to the Dom
document six. Oh. And you

666
00:36:10.170 --> 00:36:14.430
could potentially get some, some
pretty impressive gains in performance.

667
00:36:15.210 --> 00:36:18.060
Great. Yeah. There's a couple
of details up on the

668
00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:20.700
blog that folks should check
out. There were some security

669
00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:25.140
changes to MMS XML six,
and we talk about how

670
00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:27.870
we fix those and worked
around them. Cool. That's up

671
00:36:27.870 --> 00:36:32.580
at shrink, stir.com/bf zero. Great.
So as we're heading out

672
00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:34.530
the door here, Carl, but
last time as we were

673
00:36:34.530 --> 00:36:36.270
heading out the door, you
were talking about picking up

674
00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:38.160
a Prius, you know, my
wife and I have gotten

675
00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:41.360
hybrid cars and now you're
jumping on board. Just got

676
00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:44.450
it yesterday. That would be
Monday. Yeah. So I've been

677
00:36:44.450 --> 00:36:46.280
looking online to see what
people have been doing with

678
00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:50.180
their Prius's cause it is
the geeks car. Yeah. The

679
00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:52.660
pre I, cause it is
a geeks car. Right. And,

680
00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:54.890
and what could be better
than a car with a

681
00:36:54.890 --> 00:36:57.410
computer that you can hack
into and, or, you know,

682
00:36:57.410 --> 00:37:00.290
do things with. And the
most interesting thing I found

683
00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:02.480
was that a well there's
a lot of places that

684
00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:04.700
cite this story, but just
one of them is a

685
00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:10.190
tree hugger@shrinks.com slash <inaudible>. And
this is a guy who

686
00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:14.810
spent a lot of money
in research to boost his

687
00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:19.010
Prius, to get about 250
miles to the gallon. Actually,

688
00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:23.300
this one, he he's getting
110 miles per gallon, but

689
00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:26.000
I have heard of others.
In fact, there's a company

690
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.540
in California that for a
mere 12 grand, which doesn't

691
00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:32.210
add up, I've done the
math for a mere 12

692
00:37:32.210 --> 00:37:36.380
grand will install an array
of batteries in the trunk

693
00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:38.810
and you plug it in
at night. So there's this

694
00:37:38.810 --> 00:37:42.260
whole plugin Prius movement going
on. You plug it in

695
00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:45.020
at night costs about a
dollar a day to charge

696
00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:48.710
those batteries. But with normal
driving, you can get about

697
00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:51.440
a hundred, 110 miles to
the gallon. And if you

698
00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:54.440
follow some simple rules, like
only go 55 on the

699
00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:59.150
highway, and don't accelerate really
hard, you know, in that

700
00:37:59.150 --> 00:38:01.910
kind of stuff, you can
achieve 200, 250 miles to

701
00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:04.970
gallon. But this guy in
this particular article and tree

702
00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:09.560
hugger says that he did
it for about $3,000 worth

703
00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:13.730
of parts. Wow. Yeah. The,
the, the fundamental idea behind

704
00:38:13.730 --> 00:38:16.700
this is that they're fooling
the Prius into thinking it's

705
00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:20.030
got a lot of battery
power. The Prius tries to

706
00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:24.730
keep its batteries above 20%
charge and below 80, it

707
00:38:24.730 --> 00:38:26.840
tries to keep it in
that sweet spot. And they

708
00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:29.540
try to convince the Prius
that the batteries are actually

709
00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:32.930
charged up to 100%. So
it stays on battery power

710
00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:35.000
longer. Right. And when they
say that they can get

711
00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:37.840
a hundred or 150, it's
actually kind of in aggregate.

712
00:38:38.170 --> 00:38:40.270
So for example, I have
to go only one exit

713
00:38:40.270 --> 00:38:42.520
to get to work. Yeah.
So I could take the

714
00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:45.190
back roads beyond battery power
only, and I could really

715
00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:48.520
spend the entire week right.
On battery power. Right. And

716
00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:50.260
then just use the, use
the gas on the weekends,

717
00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:53.350
right? Yeah. So it really
is an aggregate. You can

718
00:38:53.650 --> 00:38:55.870
that's right. If you're just
running around town, you could

719
00:38:55.870 --> 00:38:59.680
just go forever on batteries.
Well, that dollar a day,

720
00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:05.080
you know, is $365 a
year, which over the length

721
00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:07.510
of the ownership of the
car, let's say 10 years

722
00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:11.830
could be, you know, 3,600
bucks, $3,700. So you've got

723
00:39:11.830 --> 00:39:14.380
to take that into account.
And of course, you know,

724
00:39:14.410 --> 00:39:16.660
the fact that you can
do this for $3,000 make

725
00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:18.160
sense, but if you were
going to go to a

726
00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:21.040
company and you know, and
install batteries for 12 grand,

727
00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:24.520
you basically have to have
gas costing like five, $6

728
00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:27.040
a gallon before. That really
makes sense. And really, as

729
00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:29.290
someone who bought a Prius,
you're thinking about the environment.

730
00:39:29.290 --> 00:39:32.470
So the idea is to
burn less fossil fuels does

731
00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:35.830
a dollar worth of gas
that you're saving. And instead

732
00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:39.310
having the car plugged into
your home because more fossil

733
00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:41.890
fuels to be taken out
from the coal mine that

734
00:39:41.890 --> 00:39:44.200
you spent a dollar on
that sends the electricity to

735
00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:46.360
your house, right? So you
gotta think, are you getting

736
00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:49.030
clean power? Like here at
Portland, general electric, we can

737
00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:51.100
say that I want some
percentage of my power to

738
00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:54.970
come from wind or from
hydroelectric. But if your stuff's

739
00:39:54.970 --> 00:39:56.680
coming from a coal mine,
I don't know what the

740
00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:59.500
environmental impact is between a
dollar at the pump and

741
00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:02.020
a dollar spent at your
local electric. So clearly the

742
00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:03.910
best thing to do is
to put up a windmill

743
00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:06.910
in your backyard and plug
your Prius into that at

744
00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:09.730
night. And then you can
sleep at night, right? Yeah.

745
00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:11.200
Or you can do it.
I'm doing it. Ride your

746
00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:13.900
bike to the store. There
you go. All right, Scott,

747
00:40:14.050 --> 00:40:16.150
it's been great talking to
you. I hope everybody enjoyed

748
00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:18.220
the show this week and
we'll catch you next week

749
00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:19.090
on Hansel minutes.
