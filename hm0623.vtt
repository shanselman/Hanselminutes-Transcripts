00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.550
Hey friends. I want to
thank our sponsors. And I

2
00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.530
want you to know that
putting together a show like

3
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.600
Hansel minutes takes a lot
of time, a lot of

4
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.450
effort, a lot of editing,
a website to manage a

5
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.330
lot of bandwidth. And without
our sponsors, we couldn't make

6
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.960
it happen. So first I
want to thank Reagan. Reagan

7
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.530
provides full stack error, crash,
and performance monitoring for tech

8
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.260
teams. Whether you're a software
engineer who is looking to

9
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.040
diagnose and resolve issues with
greater speed and accuracy or

10
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.740
a product manager, who's drowning
in bug reports, or you're

11
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.100
just concerned that you're losing
customers to poor quality online

12
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.450
experiences. Raygun can provide you
with the answers you get

13
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.140
full stack error and performance
monitoring in one place. So

14
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.050
the next time you're struggling
to replicate errors and performance

15
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.930
issues and your code base
think Raygun head over to

16
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.550
reagan.com. That's our a Y
G U n.com. You can

17
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.740
get up and running in
minutes and you can dramatically

18
00:00:52.740 --> 00:01:09.650
improve the online experiences of
your users. Hi, This is

19
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.230
Scott Hanselman. This is another
episode of Hansel minutes. And

20
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.780
today I have the distinct
pleasure of chatting with star

21
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.140
Trek, visual effects, master Dan
Curry. How are you, sir?

22
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.440
Very well. Thank you. How
about yourself? I'm very well

23
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.720
and thrilled to be chatting
with you. Although I must

24
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.860
say looking at your, your
accolades and online, I could

25
00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.440
probably spend about five or
10 minutes doing just an

26
00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.800
intro of you and all
the stuff that you've done

27
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.400
over the years. It's quite
a career you've had. Well,

28
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.700
it's kept me from stealing
a shopping cart and moving

29
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.290
under a bridge. You ha
you were involved in, in

30
00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.170
star Trek for what now?
Eight you're 18 years and

31
00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.740
18 years. And that's a
very small number of people

32
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.530
who were in the 18
year club working on four

33
00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.770
different shows. I think it
was maybe around 10 give

34
00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.290
or take a monitor two
on either side, but it

35
00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.230
wasn't a lot of people,
the things that you were

36
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.770
in charge of very do
you get everything from visual

37
00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.160
effects to title creation, you
even worked on star Trek

38
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.460
for the movie. That is
correct. And do you also

39
00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.190
did second unit director work
is how, why do you

40
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.890
have such a diverse background?
Did they, did they just

41
00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.480
say, Oh, let Dan do
it. He'll do a great

42
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.680
job. Or is this typical?
Well, it's not visual effects.

43
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.420
People frequently do a second
unit directing because the shots

44
00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.970
are so tactical sometimes where
say the regular episodic director

45
00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.030
doesn't have the time to
spend four hours on a

46
00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.650
given shot. They're racing to
get their day done. And

47
00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.790
they may not necessarily have
the, the expertise or even

48
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.350
the patients sometimes to do
these shots said may require

49
00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.160
various elements. And especially you
shooting people in front of

50
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.490
green screen or their explosions.
So it takes a long

51
00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:03.760
time. So that's why Frequently
the second unit director is

52
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.210
the visual effects supervisor. And
other times sometimes if it's

53
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.420
a stunt thing and the
second unit director is that

54
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.010
the stunt coordinator. Oh, okay.
So given that you are

55
00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.860
the one who's helping coordinate
the building of the props

56
00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.830
and the creation of the
effects, the you're uniquely set

57
00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.260
to be the second unit
director, if those are the

58
00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.860
shots that have all of
those effects. Well, yeah. And

59
00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.860
the thing is that my
background is in filmmaking. I

60
00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.450
have an MFA and at
both film and theater and

61
00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.420
years ago, when I got
out of the peace Corps

62
00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.800
in Thailand, I worked for
the Thai department of education

63
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:46.680
and directed a weekly Thai
language educational series. Oh, wow.

64
00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.800
That sounds like a fantastic
way to, to, is that

65
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.510
what this beginning of your
career to start your career

66
00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.020
though? Well, it was a
great experience in Thailand, but

67
00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.770
I've been making movies since
I was very young. I

68
00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.910
went after seeing the beast
from 20,000 fathoms and reading

69
00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.110
about how they, they did
that. Ray Harryhausen, the, the

70
00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.050
genius did a lot of
things for three or projection.

71
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.710
So I had a broken
eight millimeter movie projectors. So

72
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.930
I taped some tracing paper
inside a cardboard box. And,

73
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.560
but my broken projector on
one side and shot movies

74
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.350
of my brother's screaming and
then put a toy dinosaur

75
00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.230
it's lumbering around in the
foreground. So that was a

76
00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.580
beginning of my visual effects
career. And, and Ray, Harry

77
00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.100
has an a in fact,
the, kind of the creator

78
00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.070
of a stop motion form
of animation known as DynaMesh

79
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.100
and one of the early
stop motion experts and innovators.

80
00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.160
Yeah. And the influence of
Ray on the, on the

81
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.760
film industry, he can't be
underestimated that he, he was

82
00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.590
a very important figure, but
then again, Ray owes Willis,

83
00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.720
O'Brien a homage to, because
Willis doing the first King

84
00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.080
Kong and the silent version
of lost continent Willis was

85
00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:07.500
the real pioneer Indeed working
with Willis on things like

86
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.420
mighty Joe Young and the, you
know, some of the early

87
00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.060
color films in the late
in the late forties. Ah,

88
00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.910
that's true. Yeah. So one
of the things that I

89
00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:17.280
think is interesting about the
fact that you of course

90
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.340
brought up, you know, Harryhausen,
is there, wasn't a lot

91
00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.150
of visual effects cause there
wasn't any CGI. And one

92
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.720
of the things that I
think people appreciate about star

93
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.620
Trek over the years is
the balance between practical effects

94
00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:36.210
and high quality sets and,
and props and you know,

95
00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:40.620
not being heavy handed with
the graphics. Well, there was

96
00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.870
a, there were all those
visual effects. They were not,

97
00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:44.970
they were just not done
on the computer. They were

98
00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:50.490
done either in camera or
using optical printing for compositing.

99
00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.140
And one of the great
things about the star Trek

100
00:05:55.140 --> 00:06:00.140
franchise is that it mirror
the evolution of visual effects

101
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:05.900
technology. When we started next
generation, everything was done photographically

102
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.340
with the exception of compositing.
And it was one of

103
00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:16.130
the courageous decisions by paramount
to issue optical printer, compositing,

104
00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.540
to result in a film
negative as a final product

105
00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:26.600
and do it with a,
with a video compositing. And

106
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:30.320
early on, we were doing
one inch analog compositing, and

107
00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.310
then as D one came
along or D five, rather

108
00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:38.750
than we moved up to
true digital compositing. But early

109
00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:42.080
on, we were still doing
matte paintings in oils and

110
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:46.550
physical models on motion control
rigs to make the, do

111
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:52.070
the space scenes. And then
right after the end of

112
00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:56.300
star Trek, deep space nine,
we were getting into CG

113
00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.600
because the demands of the
shows were so great. We

114
00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:02.870
didn't have time to shoot
physical models and get done

115
00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:06.860
in time. So we did
some hybrid shows early on

116
00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:10.880
where the foreground ships were
physical models, but the background

117
00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:16.250
ships were CG and early
on the CG models didn't

118
00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:20.420
look quite as, as real,
there were artifacts of stretching,

119
00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:24.530
skins around three G wireframes
and stuff. But by the

120
00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:29.120
time we got to star
Trek, enterprise CG ad had

121
00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:35.000
a level of a verisimilitude
that made sense. And enterprise

122
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.260
was the first all CG
star Trek show. Oh wow.

123
00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:42.520
Do people in the business
in yourself and your compatriots,

124
00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:45.880
did you get a little
sad or wistful or when

125
00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:48.820
you, when you move from
physical models to CG or

126
00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:50.200
do you say, Oh, this
just lets us do our

127
00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:54.160
job that much more effectively.
There's always a little of

128
00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:58.630
both. There's a, every technological
innovation is a two edged

129
00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:03.940
sword and doing things early
on. It was a lot

130
00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:07.180
of say visual equivalent of
medieval alchemy. How can we

131
00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:11.110
make something look like something
it's not, there was one

132
00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:15.460
episode in next generation, arsenal
of freedom where we had

133
00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:19.040
a drone, satellite was supposed
to reenter the atmosphere and

134
00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:21.880
burn up. And of course
we couldn't do that. So

135
00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:25.390
I had the idea of
glowing slivers of plastic bag

136
00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:30.130
onto a model covered with
black flocking and photographing it

137
00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:34.540
with electric fans, causing the,
the streamers to blow around.

138
00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:37.210
And by keeping the shutter
open for three seconds of

139
00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:40.720
frame, it created this motion
blur that looked like hot

140
00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:43.720
gases coming off the model.
And then by using that

141
00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:47.380
as a, a window or
a King element, we printed

142
00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:51.430
real fire through that. And
it looked like the reentry

143
00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:54.820
heat of something entering an
atmosphere. Oh, wow. Did you

144
00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:57.480
did know this or did
You have an Intuit that

145
00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.590
this might work? We intuited,
we, we had, we were,

146
00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:03.560
it was a sprint doing
star Trek because we were

147
00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:07.130
expected to do half a
feature every few weeks. So

148
00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:09.290
we would have a guess
on how to do something.

149
00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:13.220
And based on experience and
despair can be the mother

150
00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:17.930
of invention, but mostly it
was just intuitive guessing that

151
00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:21.590
this would probably work. And
sometimes we would grit our

152
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:24.080
teeth and live with something
we were not really happy

153
00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.750
with. And not the times
we were delighted with how

154
00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:29.870
well it came out. It's
interesting that you brought up

155
00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:32.810
that particular episode, given how
many episodes you worked on,

156
00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:36.530
because one of the devices,
one of the drones, the

157
00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:40.160
echo pop echo, Popa drones,
echo Papa drums from the

158
00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:44.200
arsenal of freedom is actually
up for auction. And a

159
00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:46.760
lot of your collections, some
of the props and things

160
00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:49.820
that you've collected over the
last 18 years are up

161
00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:52.190
at heritage auctions. And we'll
have a link for that

162
00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:54.860
in the show notes where
people can go to entertainment

163
00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:57.170
dot <inaudible> dot com, and
we'll put you directly to

164
00:09:57.170 --> 00:10:00.320
the sets later this week.
And that means literally this

165
00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:05.930
week of the second week
of April, I believe the

166
00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:09.230
auction starts on the 15th of April.
You can see these props.

167
00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:11.830
And in fact, this one,
this echo Papa atmosphere and

168
00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:14.900
that pronounced echo Popa drone
is up there. This is

169
00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:18.050
something you collected and just,
you just walk away off

170
00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:20.630
the set with these things.
No, no, no. I actually

171
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:22.850
made it and no one
walked away off the set

172
00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:26.840
that would not be too
ethical. It was just a

173
00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:28.790
wound up with it. And
that when we were done

174
00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:32.690
that was either throw it
in the dumpster or keep

175
00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:34.850
it in it because I
made it myself. I thought

176
00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:37.430
it would be just something
cool to have around. And

177
00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:41.240
over the years I just
wound up with too much

178
00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:46.310
stuff. So we're trying to
minimalize our material possessions, and

179
00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:48.800
I thought it would be
good to share some of

180
00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:52.580
these objects with the fans
that are interested. Yeah, that's

181
00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:55.610
fantastic. And in fact, there
were a number of drones

182
00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:58.760
that were created to, and
one of them of course,

183
00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:02.810
went into the atmosphere and,
and had that effect that

184
00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:06.350
you just described. That's correct.
That's one of them. And

185
00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:09.290
then the, the one we
saw on the planet surfaces

186
00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:14.210
there. And interestingly enough, in
that episode, we had a

187
00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:18.450
jungle set built on stage
at paramount. And there was

188
00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:22.070
an earlier design that looked
like a three pronged cloth

189
00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:25.520
flying around. That was very
heavy. The initial idea was

190
00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:29.150
to shoot it practically, and
it was too heavy to

191
00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:31.880
run on wires. It was
too heavy to carry and

192
00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:34.820
the claws kept snagging in
the branches of the jungle.

193
00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:38.720
So the producers came to
me and said, let's figure

194
00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:42.350
something out at the last
minute. So I took a

195
00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:48.140
plastic, Easter egg and glued
a shampoo bottle on it

196
00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:54.430
with some little tube to
hide that normally it's used

197
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:57.880
to hide cables and then
glued a legs pantyhose container

198
00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:04.030
on the bottom and use
blue demo label tape for

199
00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:08.950
ports on the little drone
robot and then shot it

200
00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:11.830
in front of a green
screen. And so the blue

201
00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:15.400
allowed me to pull a
key from just the ports

202
00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.740
on the, on the device.
And then the green gave

203
00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:21.160
us an overall mat. And
the other thing that was

204
00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:24.940
different about that, everybody thought
I was crazy. I decided

205
00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:28.240
not to shoot the, a
model drone with a motion

206
00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:32.260
control. Oh wow. Which would
have taken a long time.

207
00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.080
And I, I just felt
sometimes motion control is too

208
00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:38.110
perfect and too time consuming.
And since the thing was

209
00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:41.350
supposed to flutter around and
react to the branches in

210
00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:44.320
the jungle, what I decided
to do is I put

211
00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:47.470
it upside down on the
end of a pole, put

212
00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:50.830
on a, an embarrassing green
suit and stood in front

213
00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:53.470
of a green screen. And
by that time I'd done

214
00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:56.620
Tai Chi for about 20
years. So I learned how

215
00:12:56.620 --> 00:13:00.250
to move slowly and with
as much grace as my

216
00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:04.090
clumsiness can muster. And so
all the motions of that

217
00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:07.240
drone robot were actually done
by hand by me carrying

218
00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:10.370
it on a pole That
is unbelievable. You can, I

219
00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:13.590
actually have a link in
the show notes to the,

220
00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:18.510
that segment of the, of
that episode, episode 21 of

221
00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:21.600
season one. And you won't
believe it. You won't believe

222
00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:26.280
a number of things you're
describing assembling this, this, this

223
00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:30.090
drone out of plastics and,
and what you had available

224
00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:32.790
to you. But when you
see it on screen, it's

225
00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:35.850
almost impossible to believe it
looks amazing. And if you

226
00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:38.340
look at the pictures that
we'll link to up on

227
00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:43.510
the, the heritage auction site,
you'll agree that it's, it's,

228
00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:46.710
it's almost impossible as a
layman to hear you describe

229
00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:48.670
Oh yeah. And I took
a, you know, a Hanes

230
00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.450
pantyhose egg, and that, you
know, it just seemed like

231
00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:53.610
a good idea at the
time. And it still looks

232
00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:56.370
like a million bucks on,
on the screen. Oh, I

233
00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:59.820
also painted it. And when
I do something like that,

234
00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:03.450
I do a, a base
coat of gray and then

235
00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:06.330
I just airbrushed it. So
it would look metallic and

236
00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.120
did very subtle color differences
where they were a little

237
00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:12.740
bit of blue, a little
bit of a magenta and

238
00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:17.610
those color variations make it
look very for a reflective

239
00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:21.120
and metallic. And I, that
was the key with, with,

240
00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:25.050
with that one as to
the paint job on it.

241
00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:28.350
And also I was looking
for something elegant and there's

242
00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:32.940
something wonderful and found objects
that I guess for me,

243
00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:37.290
it's instinctive, I can look
at things independent of their

244
00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:40.980
original purpose and their scale.
So say if I go

245
00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:44.280
to a hardware store and
look in the plumbing section,

246
00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:47.130
there might be a little
sleeve to use as a,

247
00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:52.190
to repair underground sprinklers and
I up using that as

248
00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:57.980
The core body for a
space, a lifeboat. Wow. Hey,

That's Mel I S S
a.com/developer, or just call one

258
00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:44.120
800. Melissa is painting such
like the most important skill

259
00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:47.690
because it's such a multimodal
and diverse set of skills.

260
00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:50.330
One needs like the ability
to airbrush something and to

261
00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:53.750
know how light hits any
surface, even a plastic surface

262
00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:55.820
and make plastic look like
metal. This is it all

263
00:15:55.820 --> 00:16:00.200
come down to painting. No
it lighting. Painting is one

264
00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:03.710
factor lighting as the other,
how it moves is another

265
00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:06.920
issue. And that that's one
of the things that makes

266
00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:10.880
film and television such a
wonderful art form because it's

267
00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:16.940
the combination of all art
forms and dance in a

268
00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:20.360
way like in the way
I moved the drone robot,

269
00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:25.190
basically as dance or the
way a great camera operator

270
00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:28.580
moves is also a form
of dance. And so you

271
00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:33.380
have painting sculpture and with
models, it's sculpture and the

272
00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:37.400
great bottle makers like Greg
Jean and Tony manager, and

273
00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:40.520
some of the others we
worked with those guys are

274
00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:44.360
true artists and they're great
sculptors, but they're also technically

275
00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:46.820
on top of what they're
doing. So they know how

276
00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:49.250
to hold light back, how
to do wiring, how to

277
00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:54.980
make parts move. So the
other hero, geniuses of star

278
00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:58.160
Trek, where, where the model
makers, who, who built the

279
00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:01.460
hero models like the enterprise
deep space, nine Voyager, those

280
00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:06.230
guys were amazing and, and
deserve the abiding respect to

281
00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:10.100
fans. I'm looking at one
of the lots that's up

282
00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:14.510
called the, the worker bee
shuttle craft that was used

283
00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:17.660
in star Trek, the next
generation. And fortunately the images

284
00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:21.620
online here are extremely high
resolution. So I can basically

285
00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:24.530
get my face right up
to it much closer than,

286
00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:27.290
than one would ordinarily get
to such a thing. And

287
00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:29.780
when you get close to
it, you can, you can

288
00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:33.050
see where things were glued
and where hot glue was

289
00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:37.250
used. And what's an led
and what's not so one,

290
00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:39.590
and by no means, do
I mean to diminish the

291
00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:42.560
work, but when one gets
abnormally close to one of

292
00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:45.950
these things, the illusion is
gone and you can see

293
00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:49.980
that like one of the
naysayer calls is a Gillette

294
00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:54.660
razor handle, but if you
simply move a foot away,

295
00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:58.350
that illusion disappears and they'll
suddenly you're really looking at

296
00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:01.990
a spaceship and it looked
amazing on screen. Well, that

297
00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:07.490
another one that it's some
of the old guard, visual

298
00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:09.800
effects guys would call it
the joke or the gag,

299
00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:17.360
because it's, it's a form
of prestidigitation. And so in

300
00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:20.180
that case, I knew we
would never get that close

301
00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:23.840
to it. And I used
it only when enterprise was

302
00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:28.790
in dry dock and I
borrowed a broken robot foot

303
00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:32.360
from my son's toy bin
and blew those razors on

304
00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:34.700
it. And a couple of
other parts, and my colleague,

305
00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:37.730
Gary, Hutzel wired it up
with the led lights and,

306
00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:42.530
and that was it. And,
but by, by knowing that

307
00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:47.600
we wouldn't get too close
to it and, and making

308
00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:52.190
sure that there were enough
interesting surface details to catch

309
00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:55.610
light and make moving shadows.
That's what gives it, that

310
00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:59.330
feeling of verisimilitude in context,
because people see it go

311
00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:02.540
by, but they're really looking
at the enterprise and looking

312
00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:05.810
at the grand scope of
the, the whole dry dock

313
00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:10.910
situation. Yeah, exactly. That holistic,
it's not just a, a

314
00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:14.630
model close up in the
stark, bright white lights of

315
00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:18.050
the, of the internet. It's
everything in whole with light

316
00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:21.290
and sound and motion. Yeah.
It's context. And it is

317
00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:24.080
Context. Absolutely. Some of the
things that are up here

318
00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:27.170
on the auction are amazing.
The Voyager Borg city, some

319
00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:31.260
concepts sculptures are the concepts,
cultures not used in the

320
00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:35.600
show, but rather used to
model a CGI effects. Exactly.

321
00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:41.330
Sometimes whether it's people in
the art department or myself

322
00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:44.180
would do drawings for what
we had in mind. And

323
00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:47.600
of course the producers would
have to approve them. But

324
00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:51.800
in case of certain things
that are very, very complicated,

325
00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:57.320
a drawing would be very
difficult and to interpret. So

326
00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:00.560
I went into my, I
have a modest woodshop at

327
00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:03.950
home. So I went in
and started, started with a

328
00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:06.950
cube and then built out
for it, thinking about how

329
00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:11.720
the Borg sink that they
are eminently pragmatic, and they

330
00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:17.300
don't make artistic design decisions.
See the shape of objects

331
00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:21.770
is form follows function. And
so as the Borg city

332
00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:24.950
expanded, they'd keep adding on
and adding on like an

333
00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:28.610
endless housing development and they
just build something that they

334
00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:34.370
needed. So I approached creating
that, that conceptual model, that

335
00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:37.790
way, here's a cube, Oh,
well now they need a

336
00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:40.220
little thing that does this
kind of work. Now they

337
00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:43.490
have a science lab over
here. And so I just

338
00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:49.000
built it intuitively and then
painted up. And that made

339
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.590
it a lot easier for
the CG artists to build

340
00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:57.490
that city because they could
walk around and look at

341
00:20:57.490 --> 00:21:02.380
it from different, different sides.
And so I explained, well,

342
00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:05.170
let's assume that this cube
is a kilometer and a

343
00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:09.220
half on each side. And
then it just goes on

344
00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:13.060
for hundreds of miles and
they, so they, they got

345
00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:16.600
it immediately and did, of
course their usual brilliant job.

346
00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:21.150
Fantastic. It's the sculptural equivalent
of a rough sketch. And

347
00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:24.120
you say, look, look at,
make it like this. That's

348
00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:27.270
exactly right. It's a sculptural
equivalent of rough sketch and

349
00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:31.770
a hot glue is something
that's a great tool for

350
00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:34.320
that because you can glue
stuff together very instantly and

351
00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:37.350
work fast. And then I
went back and reinforced everything

352
00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:41.160
with the poxy at all
the joints. Oh wow. And

353
00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:43.560
now it's, of course, as
it's being auctioned off, it

354
00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:46.500
is mounted on a nice,
on a nice plate and

355
00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:49.560
felt covered wood base and
would look great certainly on

356
00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:53.010
my, on my mantle or
someone's manual. Well, I would

357
00:21:53.010 --> 00:21:57.000
hope so. And know, my,
my goal is that these

358
00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.840
things shouldn't be buried in
my garage or my storage

359
00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:03.510
unit. They should be in
the hands of people that,

360
00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:07.350
that that's the work of
any artist. They want people

361
00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:09.630
to own them and appreciate
them for what they are.

362
00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:12.990
Yeah, indeed. One of the
things that I was interested

363
00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:15.930
in is not just creating
a, certainly not just creating

364
00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:20.400
effects, but conceiving of things
that are now somewhat iconic.

365
00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:25.500
You created the battle with
cling on sword and the,

366
00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:29.880
the KLS, his sword from
deep space nine is actually

367
00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:32.400
part of this auction as
well. How does that come

368
00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:34.860
about as a writer conceive
of like, ah, the Klingons

369
00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:37.410
got a mean looking knife,
and then you take it

370
00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:40.440
from there. Or how does
that, How that came about

371
00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:45.180
was we had an episode
of TNG where WARF was

372
00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:51.660
to inherit a primordial Klingon
bladed weapon. And the first

373
00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:55.560
idea that came down was
a, something that looked like

374
00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:58.770
a Pirate's Cutlass. And I
looked at it and, and

375
00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:00.660
it had a couple of
flanges on it. And even

376
00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:04.530
as a, as a boy,
I didn't like movie weapons

377
00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:08.280
that were designed to look
cool, but weren't, and, and

378
00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:11.400
that's a disparity of original
design, but, and I had

379
00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:14.700
been imagining what became the
bat left for a long

380
00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:16.860
time, but never had any
reason to bring it into

381
00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:21.150
existence. So I made one
out of foam core and

382
00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:24.540
went into the producer's office
and said, Hey, let's do

383
00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:28.110
something that's never existed before.
So they, the claimants have

384
00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:33.210
something unique to their culture,
but it also is ergonomically

385
00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:36.510
sound as a weapon. So,
and then I said, I

386
00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:39.510
can make up a whole
series of moves for this.

387
00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:42.660
And the producers looked at
it and said, cool, let's

388
00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:45.470
do it. So then I
got the chance to, with

389
00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:49.910
our wonderful stunt coordinator, Dennis
Madeline, who had first had

390
00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:53.720
a grim opinion of it
until I said, well, look,

391
00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:55.730
Dennis, we can do this
and this and this. And

392
00:23:55.730 --> 00:23:59.120
suddenly he became a very
excited about it. And then

393
00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:02.450
as in one of the
other stunt guys, Tommy Morga

394
00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:06.950
became real masters of, of
using the bat left. So

395
00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:10.910
when it came time to
going back to the bat

396
00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:14.840
left, it's the, the Korean
martial arts association approved as

397
00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:18.650
one of the first new
bladed weapon in 200 years,

398
00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:22.910
that has practical value. And
even the Navy department of

399
00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:26.480
research contacted me and wanted
to talk to me about

400
00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:31.820
my ideas about a weapon
ergonomics. And when it came

401
00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:34.190
time on deep space sign
from the sort of Kayla's

402
00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:38.390
house Kayla's being the quintessential
cling on warrior. And I

403
00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:42.560
always just imagined KLS has
been something like the great

404
00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:47.690
Irish warrior, who Colin from
a Caltech history. And so

405
00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:50.450
I thought, well, Kayla should
have something like the bat

406
00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:53.450
left, but it should be
more vicious and more Baroque

407
00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:57.020
because of the intensity of
violence in his time period.

408
00:24:57.260 --> 00:25:00.620
So I had this idea
of doing this central spike

409
00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:04.370
in the middle for, I
call it a disempowerment flange

410
00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:09.560
and other flanges on the
weapon. So you can grapple

411
00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:13.820
an opponent's weapon and inflict
harm on your opponent and

412
00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:18.600
in even greater variety of
ways. My goodness. And this

413
00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:21.130
is become such a thing
though over the last, you

414
00:25:21.130 --> 00:25:24.700
know, many years that you
can find sword makers and

415
00:25:25.450 --> 00:25:29.500
blacksmiths who will take creating
a, a bat left as

416
00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:32.620
a, as a tool to
make it and to create

417
00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:34.090
it and then to do
a video about it As

418
00:25:34.090 --> 00:25:37.930
a challenge. Yeah. What's also
is interesting is how many

419
00:25:37.930 --> 00:25:42.070
people claim they invented it,
Which is interesting given that,

420
00:25:42.090 --> 00:25:45.190
that you created the original
prop that was used, and

421
00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:47.770
then only two were made
one for an exhibit and

422
00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:50.740
one for your own collection,
which is now being auctioned

423
00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:53.170
off. Yeah, that was the
one that, that was my

424
00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:59.590
compensation for helping provide stuff
to the Las Vegas star

425
00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:02.500
Trek experience. So when Gill
had been, who was one

426
00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:08.230
of America's national treasures, he's
a great knife, Baker knife,

427
00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:11.260
throwing hall of fame, and
also a master of the

428
00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:14.350
rhythm bones, a neolithic instrument,
kind of like casting and

429
00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:19.090
nets. And so Gil made
the one for Las Vegas

430
00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:20.740
and they made it, he
made a second one for

431
00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:24.040
me as, as a favor
Indeed. And he also created

432
00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:27.850
the knife in Rambo. So
he'll get a master knife

433
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.270
Maker and the Expendables. And
if you look up Gil

434
00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:35.530
Hibbing online, he does these
incredible fantasy knives that are

435
00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:39.790
beautiful works of art. Yeah.
I'm going to include links

436
00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:43.030
to all of this in
the show notes. So given

437
00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:46.080
length of your career and
the depth and breadth of

438
00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:49.170
the things that you worked
on, I'm curious now that

439
00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:52.770
we've got social media and
everyone online and the rise

440
00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:56.490
of cosplay, what do you
feel about watching different amateur

441
00:26:56.490 --> 00:27:00.540
cause players create their props
out of foam core and

442
00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:05.840
techniques that you and your,
your compatriots started with? I

443
00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:09.200
think it's cool. It's very
flattering to see so many

444
00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:13.340
people be inspired and want
to do that. And, and

445
00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:17.990
I sometimes get videos of
P from people showing how

446
00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:21.140
they come up with their
own kata or form to

447
00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:24.200
use the bat left, and
then I'll give them advice

448
00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:28.400
and tend to advise them
not to use them as

449
00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:32.060
choppers, but there should be
much more a fluid kind

450
00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:36.440
of a Tai Chi like
motion so that when you're

451
00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:40.100
using a heavy weapon, you
really wind up getting its

452
00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:43.040
momentum going and guiding it
rather than using it as

453
00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:47.330
a Vegomatic chopper. Yeah, indeed.
It's meant to be a

454
00:27:47.330 --> 00:27:49.880
weapon, but an elegant weapon,
not a, not a sloppy

455
00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:53.390
weapon, I would hope so.
Yeah. And it sounds like

456
00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:56.450
your, your expertise in Tai
Chi and martial arts informed

457
00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:59.480
a lot of the work
that you did. Yeah. And

458
00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:02.630
I think weapons, it's something
I've always been interested in

459
00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:05.630
as a, as a boy
watching medieval movies and movies

460
00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:10.310
set in ancient times. So
weapons always fascinated me and

461
00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:13.730
star Trek gave me a
wonderful home where a lot

462
00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:18.800
of my goofy skills actually
had value. I'm curious. Do

463
00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:20.510
you think that this is
going to become a lost

464
00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:23.390
art, that creation of more
practical effects of physical props

465
00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:24.950
and miniatures? Or do you
think that we are still

466
00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:27.110
in the golden age of
creating these kinds of effects?

467
00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:30.710
Well, there will always be
physical props because actors need

468
00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:33.350
to interact with them and
hold them and use them.

469
00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:38.930
And it's going to ebb
and flow the wonderful aspect

470
00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:43.460
of CG. And certainly at
it's evolved to an incredible

471
00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:46.970
art form. Is that anything
we can imagine is now

472
00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:51.140
a doable in a very
convincing way. And so as

473
00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:56.330
resolution gets greater and greater
and computing power gets greater

474
00:28:56.330 --> 00:29:00.470
and greater CG is still
in its, in its infancy.

475
00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:05.450
And it's, and I just
think as future generations evolve

476
00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:07.340
the art form, it's just
going to get better and

477
00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:09.980
better. And you look at
some of the great tent

478
00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:13.700
pole films that are coming
out, and you know that

479
00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:17.420
with the hundreds of million
dollar budgets, the, the work

480
00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:21.440
done in terms of water,
simulation and rain and so

481
00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:25.550
forth, it's a, it's truly
remarkable what can be accomplished.

482
00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:29.360
Yeah, indeed. It does feel
though sometimes that the, the,

483
00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:32.720
at least the American movie
audience somehow gets jaded and

484
00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:34.820
they say, Oh, you know,
transformers are just a mess,

485
00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:38.480
a CG and robots bashing.
I couldn't tell what was

486
00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:41.620
going on on screen. There's
too much. So there's too

487
00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:45.010
much CG That can happen.
At some point, I would

488
00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:48.070
kind of argue with that
a little bit. It's basically

489
00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:51.340
the vision, the vision of
the filmmaker. That's like a,

490
00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:53.890
the King of Sweden telling
Mozart, there are too many

491
00:29:53.890 --> 00:29:58.510
notes in your piece of
music. I think what happens,

492
00:29:58.510 --> 00:30:00.790
it's not so much an
issue of too much CG,

493
00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:05.020
but the existing for its
own stake in dominating the

494
00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:09.100
story. And ultimately people want
to be told stories that

495
00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:13.390
have some revelation about the
human condition. That is a

496
00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:17.770
valid point. And indeed ultimately
using transformers as the, as

497
00:30:17.770 --> 00:30:19.510
the whipping boy in this
example is this is the

498
00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:22.450
vision of the, of the
director. And certainly the visual

499
00:30:22.450 --> 00:30:25.600
effects team gave him exactly
what he asked for. That's

500
00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:29.470
true because the visual effects
team, a division of the,

501
00:30:29.770 --> 00:30:32.950
of the director or in
television, more importantly, it's the

502
00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:37.240
producers that are the creative
through line because they're different

503
00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:43.150
directors for most episodes, so
that the creative consistency comes

504
00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:47.080
from the producers who supervise
and maintain a stylist to

505
00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:50.920
consistency and thematic consistency in,
in a, in a given

506
00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:53.980
show deed. Well, thank you
so much for chatting with

507
00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:57.910
me today. Oh, thank you.
It was a very enjoyable,

508
00:30:58.510 --> 00:31:00.400
I wish you all the
best of luck on your

509
00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:04.930

And I would encourage folks

510
00:31:04.930 --> 00:31:06.700

00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:08.770
at the show notes. We'll
include links to all the

512
00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:12.670
different lots and also information
and links that Dan and

513
00:31:12.670 --> 00:31:16.360
