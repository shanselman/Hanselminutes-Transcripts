21
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:43.670
Ray gun@raygundotiofromhanselminutes.com. It's Hansel minutes,
a weekly discussion with web

22
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.560
developer and technologist Scott Hanselman.
This is Lawrence Ryan announcing show

23
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.550
number four eight. In this
episode, Scott talks with Andrea

24
00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:59.000
Gita about the current state
of virtual reality. Hi, this

25
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.490
is Scott Hanselman. This is
another episode of Hansel minutes.

26
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.670
And today I'm chatting with
Andrea Gita. She used to

27
00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.980
work for unity. We've all
heard of unity, and now

28
00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.710
she works for GitHub, which
we have also all heard

29
00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.540
of. You've worked at lots
of places that we've heard

30
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.870
of. Yes, this is true.
I've got hi. How are

31
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.280
you? I am very good.
I am so very pleased

32
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.950
to be here. My pleasure.
And it's always fun to

33
00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.200
talk to you the last
time I saw you. We

34
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.630
were talking about augmented reality
and virtual reality together. Yes,

35
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.770
exactly. When looking at the
holodeck announcements and all of

36
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.730
that completely crazy stuff, I
would like it to be

37
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.650
a holodeck though. It feels
like it should be a

38
00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.530
holodeck. That's what we're doing.
I mean, aren't, don't you

39
00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.010
think as an industry? That
is the Yes, totally. I

40
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.740
mean, it's, it's, it's, we're
getting there. The augmented, the,

41
00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.220
in the virtual experiences are
aligning and it's, it's totally

42
00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.280
a holodeck. I think like
both of them are going

43
00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.880
to get together. It's going
to completely blow our minds

44
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.380
even more than it's already
doing. Do you think that

45
00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.650
augmented reality and virtual reality
is going to be a,

46
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:13.650
and this is a cliche,
the next iPad. Yes. For

47
00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.850
the next generation. I mean,
we are, we are in

48
00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.840
the transition, the generation that's
coming now are, are they,

49
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.880
the iPad is their thing,
right? The next generation is

50
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.870
gonna have the augmented reality
and virtual reality as a

51
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.230
normal thing, right. There are
going to be the content

52
00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.370
builders. As we, as we
are the content builders for

53
00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.400
the current generation, that's using
things, right. They're going to

54
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.070
be the content filters for
the next generation. So it's

55
00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:49.200
going to progress from there
and in a world changing

56
00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.320
view of things. It makes
me wonder if the second

57
00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.510
life people who I still
look on as being a

58
00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.650
little bit weird were ahead
of their time. Oh yeah,

59
00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.460
totally. I mean, even at
the same time that they

60
00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.660
were launching, I remember there
was a company called doing

61
00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.100
a thing called black sun
black soon to access, which

62
00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.340
was also like literally all
to world with shopping malls

63
00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.690
and everything that was directly
like the title black sun

64
00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.550
is the, the, like the,
the building in snow crash

65
00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.880
where all the hackers get
together. Right. And this is

66
00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.140
really early, like second life
who was just starting. This

67
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:36.570
was 98, something like that.
So, I mean, everybody's already,

68
00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.520
it's all of the technologies
that you see have multiple

69
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.090
generations and iterations. There's always
someone in coming out really

70
00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.870
early, but there's, there wouldn't
be the technology if they

71
00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.230
didn't start there. Right? Yeah.
Yeah. Black son, B L

72
00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:56.310
a X X, U N.
They were in 1995. And

73
00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.570
unfortunately, so early on, they
were gone by 2002. Yeah.

74
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.090
I remember having a disc
and playing with it, like,

75
00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.210
because the company I was
working for at the time

76
00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.330
was trying to figure out
how to do these experiences,

77
00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.820
like, you know, virtual reality
shopping malls or looking at

78
00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.540
interiors of buildings and architecture,
stuff like that. So that

79
00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.200
was, that was mind blowing
at the time. We've only

80
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.690
gotten three minutes into the
podcast and it didn't take

81
00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.120
you that long to mention
snow crash. And I don't

82
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.030
know if everyone who has
who's listening is familiar with

83
00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:31.560
snow crash, but maybe you
could talk a little bit

84
00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.390
about that book and what
it means to you and

85
00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.280
what it means. Why does
it keep coming up so

86
00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.090
early on in discussions around
augmented and virtual reality? So

87
00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:44.520
I think it's because it
is so real and accurate

88
00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:49.440
to the experience of how
you build of something completely

89
00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:55.170
new. Not only because it
was describing a virtual reality,

90
00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:58.970
but describing the lives of
people inside the virtual reality,

91
00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:03.080
which why people used it,
right. People logged in just

92
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.550
to meet with friends or
to show off or to

93
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:11.780
do business. And it was
just a normal experience. So

94
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:16.100
the, the, the book already
shows the virtual reality in

95
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:19.190
a generation that's using it,
not as a gimmick, but

96
00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:23.240
already as something that is
a part of life, basically.

97
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.370
And that, that this, where
you throw a light into

98
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:30.860
a completely different universe that
doesn't exist. And this is

99
00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:34.910
at a time where like
computers, internet so barely young

100
00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:38.810
or not even there. Right.
And just to put that

101
00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:42.020
light in a world where
you can just shift, it's

102
00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:46.010
not even in construction, it's
already there. It's, it's gone

103
00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:48.650
through all of the iterations
that we're still going through.

104
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:53.990
And at that time it
was completely crazy. And it's

105
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:58.550
a vision, right. But it's,
those visions are the ones

106
00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:03.020
that actually give you a
goal. So you need something

107
00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.420
to strive for, even if
you don't get there, at

108
00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:08.900
least there's goalposts. It was
like, I want that. And

109
00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:14.060
that's why everybody's going, like
everybody it's snow crash because

110
00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:17.710
that's what, like, I want
that. Yeah. And, you know,

111
00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:19.660
we talked a little bit
at the beginning about the

112
00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:25.690
holodeck, but the holodeck was
a curiosity. It was where

113
00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:30.760
the captain went to chill.
But the holodeck only in

114
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:33.700
later, did it become an
actual, like sentience thing. And

115
00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:35.380
they would fight with it.
And they were AIS in

116
00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:37.510
the holodeck, but it was
never part of the economy.

117
00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.300
It was never part of
the living, breathing, you know,

118
00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:42.520
aspect of their everyday life.
It was just a place

119
00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:46.660
that they went to hang
out. Yeah. Which is why,

120
00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:50.740
I mean, which is why
most, I think most developers

121
00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:55.840
that think fee VR thinks
no crash more than thinking

122
00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:00.340
holodeck because it wasn't a
part, it, it became a

123
00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:05.080
part, it went like interfering
started using it for, you

124
00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:09.550
know, you can see like
the CSI things of today,

125
00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:13.210
where with the holograms that
they map and, and move

126
00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:17.260
things around for truly that,
that was what they did

127
00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:21.250
in the holodeck interfering of
a couple of episodes like

128
00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:24.610
that. But it was between
the heart of the holodeck

129
00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:29.020
is amazingly cool, but it's
not, it's more a gimmick.

130
00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:32.770
It's less it's, it's kind
of like at the point

131
00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:35.920
in history where it's still
new, it's still a thing

132
00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:38.320
it's still, what are we
going to do with this

133
00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:42.610
while snow crash is just,
it's there it's part of

134
00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:46.060
life it's internet, but in
three D Yeah. And the

135
00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:48.160
thing that was not only
was it integrated with the

136
00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:52.480
universe, but that Stevenson the
author. And again, this is

137
00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:55.710
1992, I think when snow
crash was written, when they

138
00:08:55.710 --> 00:09:00.840
would enter this, this metaverse,
they had different levels of

139
00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:04.500
interaction based on how much
money they had. So people

140
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:07.830
who are entering the metaverse
from a low quality public

141
00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:11.040
terminal would see a black
and white metaverse that was

142
00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.470
3d, but it was great,
you know, grainy and poor,

143
00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:16.890
but rich people would, would,
you know, Jack in with

144
00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:19.680
goggles and they'd be on
it 24, seven, they would

145
00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:23.130
choose to live in it
like that. I'm like, what

146
00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:31.370
was the movie with Bruce Willis?
Oh, the surrogates. Yes. Which

147
00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:36.560
is also another book. Yeah.
And, and also locked in

148
00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:39.320
the recent yeah. With the
idea that, well, if you

149
00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.990
can't move, if you are
physically disabled to the point

150
00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:43.910
where you're not able to
move at all, you could

151
00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:46.760
potentially Jack in and have
a very, very successful life

152
00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:50.930
through a surrogate, a robot.
Yeah. But to the thing

153
00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:52.520
that was so interesting is
that he knew, he was

154
00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:56.570
thinking about goggles and, you
know, Google glass before anyone

155
00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:58.670
was thinking about those things.
This is 23 years ago.

156
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.600
Yes. It's amazing. If you
read the description of the

157
00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:08.690
scenes where he's checked in,
like he's describing something that

158
00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:12.710
we now know is the
Oculus it's, it's goggles connected

159
00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:17.210
with a cord. And funny
enough, he has exactly the

160
00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:19.550
same problems in the book
that Oculus has in real

161
00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:22.120
life, which is, if you,
if you push the, the,

162
00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:25.550
the core two months, the
goggles back, come off, your

163
00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:29.270
face and movement is annoying
because you want to move.

164
00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:32.060
Right. But at the same
time, you're stuck with that

165
00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:38.120
wire. So, and that, that's
what at the scenes having

166
00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:41.600
to lug the wires around,
but you need the wires

167
00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:46.010
because you need, you need
the bandwidth for, for being,

168
00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:50.570
for everything, for things not
to be in, you know,

169
00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.880
black and white. Right. Right.
You don't have the bandwidth

170
00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:54.620
you need that. You don't
want jitter. You need high

171
00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:57.740
Rez. I mean, it needs
to be jacked in HTMI

172
00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:00.860
high quality. Yeah. Totally. I
mean, the guy who the

173
00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:03.530
guy was really, he thought
about it, you thought about

174
00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:07.880
it, you thought about how
do you, what does the

175
00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:11.930
hardware look like? I mean,
not the wireless back then

176
00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:15.230
was not an option, but
even if it was, you

177
00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:17.870
still need, you still need
the wire because you need

178
00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:22.190
the bandwidth. And it's like,
what does it look like?

179
00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:25.280
And why would it operate?
I mean, he really thought

180
00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:28.190
about it. And I was,
I was looking at Michael

181
00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:34.070
Abrash. He wrote a blog
post when he joined Oculus

182
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.620
saying that the telling how
he got there, and there

183
00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:43.400
was snow crash and ready
player one, which is another

184
00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:49.010
book that gives you the
same vision. But now we

185
00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:51.050
know how the word where
it looks like. So let's

186
00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:54.280
push it a bit more
in terms of, you know,

187
00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:57.280
getting full checked and the
whole body suit and like

188
00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:00.700
everything and how kids would
grow up in an environment

189
00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:03.490
like this. But it's not
crashed I'm in the age.

190
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.230
Both of these already fit
that in terms of, that's

191
00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:12.010
why I think people really,
they don't want to die.

192
00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:13.750
They don't want to get
to well before they see

193
00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:16.390
this actually happening. And they
really, really want this to

194
00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:19.740
happen because it was so
much fun. Well, that's making

195
00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:22.530
me realize though, that you,
you said that, you know,

196
00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:26.910
today's like my children, they're
the iPad generation. Right. Am

197
00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:29.280
I going to be just
an old guy? That's like

198
00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.680
jacked into the net, you
know, is that, are we

199
00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:35.010
going to go to where
the old people are? And

200
00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:37.020
they're all just going to
be jacked in running around.

201
00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:39.810
I bet if you thought
of the symptoms or not

202
00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:46.230
for drama, the old people
are, are, they haven't have

203
00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:51.320
a virtual reality of put
away. So, well, let's let

204
00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:54.030
me this thing, Let's talk
about the details of the,

205
00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:58.050
of, of the Oculus and
things like it. When you

206
00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:00.720
put this on and I've,
I've used the dev kit

207
00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:04.500
one, is that Yeah. The
decay one. Yeah. And it

208
00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:07.410
was about for ADP, it
was interlaced. It had a

209
00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:10.500
screen door effect. I was
distinctly aware that this was

210
00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:14.940
on my head, but if
I mentally forgot about, if

211
00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:18.000
I forced myself to forget
about the resolution, the thing

212
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.130
that is so striking about
the Oculus isn't, whether it's

213
00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:22.200
high rise or not, I
think it's the, it's the

214
00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:25.170
naturalness of the movement of
the head. There's a, there's

215
00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:27.810
a smoothness to it. And
a lack of jitter and

216
00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:30.810
immediacy to it that, that
you don't see anywhere else.

217
00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:36.240
Yeah. It's so the Tiki
one, totally remember the first

218
00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:39.030
time I put it on,
it was, it took me

219
00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:41.070
because I put it on
with our classes and I

220
00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:43.530
wear glasses, but I don't
like having stuff, you know,

221
00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:45.630
like the three thing goggles
in the movies or the

222
00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:49.650
Oculus stuffed and on top
of my glasses and I

223
00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:51.990
don't see that badly, so
I can, I can deal

224
00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:54.810
with it when I put
it on the first time.

225
00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:57.180
I didn't see the screen
door effect immediately because of

226
00:13:57.180 --> 00:14:03.780
that, what's really like hit
me, was the space, the

227
00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:07.020
feeling that you are no
longer in the same space

228
00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:11.310
that there's other space. Right.
And if you stretch your

229
00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:13.680
hands, you're not going to
hit walls, even though you're

230
00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:16.440
standing right next to a
wall, but your brain immediately

231
00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:20.520
says, yes, I have teleported
into something else. I totally

232
00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:24.660
accept this. That's true. And
you know, it's not right,

233
00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:30.900
but it's the brain goes,
Oh yeah, totally. I'm walking

234
00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:33.360
around in Italy. You know,
that's exactly that you do

235
00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.580
the Italian demo, right. That
was the walking around on

236
00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:39.180
the Italian Villa. I did
the first one actually was

237
00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:44.820
the demo where you're sitting
down and being judged and

238
00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:46.950
you don't actually move around.
You're always sitting down. The

239
00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:48.570
only thing that you can
do is look around the

240
00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:50.550
room. The room is very
dark and there's like three

241
00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:54.080
judges on a panel in
front of you saying things

242
00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:57.620
that you don't really like
more, more, more like a

243
00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:00.590
Charlie Brown. And then you're
looking around, it's dark and

244
00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:04.400
you can see like eyes
peeking behind curtains. And it's

245
00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:07.280
kind of really weird. And
then suddenly they touch you.

246
00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:12.080
The trapdoor opens under your
seat and you fall and

247
00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:16.460
you're falling through a tube.
And then suddenly you're free

248
00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:20.960
falling. I don't know how
many kilometers to above the

249
00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:24.020
ground. And you see the
ground and you are falling

250
00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:28.130
and you can, you are
like, you don't even need

251
00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:31.220
the wind to realize that
you are falling the entire

252
00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:36.080
thing. So your brain just
goes, yup. I'm falling. And

253
00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:38.930
it's grab your seat. Yeah.
I mean, you go like

254
00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:41.570
this, everybody grabs. I mean,
you gotta go. It's completely

255
00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:44.480
static. And Raul, what the
hell they look up? They

256
00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.340
look down and it's like,
Oh my God, I'm falling.

257
00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:51.710
And it's completely believable. And,
but even better because you

258
00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:54.380
actually sitting down and not
moving people that are prone

259
00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:58.940
to having to being sick
because of the emotion signals

260
00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:03.440
because of the, the, the
Oculus, like if the demos

261
00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:06.830
not quite calibrated for the
speed that your brain thinks

262
00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:10.580
you should be moving your
head, you'll get sick. Yeah.

263
00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:14.380
It was a really interesting
experience. I had the DK

264
00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:16.900
one, I bought it, I
hooked it up to my

265
00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:19.630
machine and I play, I
hacked the little, there's a

266
00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:23.290
switch in half-life because I
wanted to try something significant

267
00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:27.670
and half-life put in a
VR switch and I honestly

268
00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:30.610
got nauseous. I'm actually getting
a little nauseous thinking about

269
00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:34.630
it because it's amazing. But
at the same time, your

270
00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:38.620
brain really knows. If it's
off by a millisecond or

271
00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:42.430
10 milliseconds, like it's a
jitter is wrong. You get

272
00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:46.840
violently ill quickly. That seems
like that's the number one

273
00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:48.850
issue that they're gonna have
to solve. Not the resolution.

274
00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:54.300
Yeah. It's it's bad. And
actually it wasn't as bad.

275
00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:56.530
Like the, the, with the
TK one when I tried

276
00:16:56.530 --> 00:17:04.300
it, I tried rollercoaster demos.
Amazing, amazing. I tried a

277
00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:06.520
bunch of demos. I never
got, I never got motion

278
00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:10.870
sickness. The TK two, the
first one I tried, that

279
00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:17.110
was, that was so a
better resolution. The refresh rate

280
00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:20.530
is higher in general. It's
still the screen door effect,

281
00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:23.770
but much. I mean, I'm
much more reduced. It's still

282
00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:28.480
there, but most of all,
so it, it has more

283
00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.910
power. I can show you
more pixels. And there was

284
00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:34.030
probably more demos at the
time. It's faster in terms

285
00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:37.990
of, of reaction. Latency is
lower. All of this stuff,

286
00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:44.800
which means that any, any
weird stuff between the speed

287
00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:47.710
at which you move either
at body or your head,

288
00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:51.950
or if you're controlling with
keyboard, then you go forward

289
00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:54.960
the speed at which you
expect to move. And the

290
00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:58.410
speed at which you actually
move is different. Your brain

291
00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:02.940
will just go, no, this
is no immediately. It's really

292
00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:05.700
it's it. It was like,
it was just looking around

293
00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:09.000
a little airplane and it
was like, Oh, okay. But

294
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.110
that, that is something that
is, I mean, it's, it

295
00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:15.540
has to do with content.
It has to do with

296
00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:18.420
the people that make it,
because that's going to happen.

297
00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:22.470
It's expectations of the brain
in terms of your body.

298
00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:24.810
Because now it's not only
just looking at the screen

299
00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:28.020
and you know, you can
move around, but you're not

300
00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:31.560
in it. And you can
actually, probably either, you know,

301
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:34.320
it's, it's a game. It's,
you're a praying can totally

302
00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:38.190
separate yourself because you can
move your head independently of

303
00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:40.800
what you're seeing on the
screen. When you have one

304
00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:43.860
of these things on, there's
no separation at all, your

305
00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:46.770
brain will totally buy it
because it does. And then

306
00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:50.070
anything that doesn't really, really
jive with, what your brain

307
00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:54.690
is expecting really kills you.
I also tried the Crescent

308
00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:59.370
Bay prototype and that one
is amazing. What is the

309
00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:04.920
name of that? Again? The
question PEI Crescent Bay. No,

310
00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:09.420
it's the next gen Oculus.
So it's the one before

311
00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:12.540
the commercial version, right? So
there's the TK one, then

312
00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:15.090
there's the ticket two. And
then they, they did the

313
00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:20.000
next minute. I think it's
Crescent. Remember the prototype? No,

314
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.280
it's a prototype that is
only available for them as

315
00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:27.510
I try to unity because
there were, there were the

316
00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:32.250
Marine get out and that
thing is like, it's really

317
00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:36.380
something else. Screen door effects
almost gone. Okay. So it

318
00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:39.950
really is getting better. Yes.
And they track you with

319
00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:42.830
a camera. It's actually the
one that they were demoing.

320
00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:47.030
It built. I think there
were a bunch of Harkness

321
00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:49.730
there. So they have a
bunch of dots on the

322
00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:54.530
element now on my little
screen, the thing. Yeah. So

323
00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:56.480
they track you with it
and if a red camera

324
00:19:57.020 --> 00:20:02.270
or which tracks the dots.
So yeah, exactly. Which basically

325
00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:10.280
means you can peek around
corners. I want to take

326
00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:13.310
a brief moment to thank
my sponsors sync fusion this

327
00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:17.450
week, the first and only
complete Hadoop distribution designed for

328
00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:21.110
windows is now available from
sync fusion. You can literally

329
00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:24.920
deploy a production ready, big
data cluster in minutes. This

330
00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:27.440
revolutionary big data platform will
not only change the way

331
00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:30.740
that you approach big data,
but it is 100% free

332
00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:34.580
for everyone with free commercial
support for sync fusion. Plus

333
00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:43.520
members learn more at sync,
fusion.com/big data. So I understand

334
00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:45.590
that with the gyros inside
of an Oculus, I can

335
00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:47.920
turn my head left and
right. But if I stray,

336
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:51.130
if I move my head
laterally, yeah. How does it

337
00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:52.630
know that? Well, if a
web cam was in front

338
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:54.130
of you, it can know
that. So that would make

339
00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:57.660
everything more stable, I would
think, Hey, Exactly. So, and

340
00:20:57.660 --> 00:21:00.730
gives you way more degrees
of freedom. So for the

341
00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:04.230
DK too, you can already
detect a upward motion left

342
00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:07.320
right up down, because, because
the sensors can let you

343
00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:11.250
track that, but you can't
can't track. If you leaning

344
00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:13.890
forward, you can track this
as long as you have

345
00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:16.620
an actual camera that can
check. I think he too

346
00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:21.360
has it's comes with a
small camera that gets connected

347
00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:25.710
to the U the Oculus.
So he can actually detect

348
00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:28.620
if you're leaning forward, what
they did was give you

349
00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:31.500
even more degrees of freedom.
So you can look under

350
00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:36.000
things and you can look
around things and it tracks

351
00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:38.310
the whole movement of the
head. So you can, you

352
00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:41.340
can track neck movements because
of that, even if you're

353
00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:44.520
not moving at all. And
that, and then they have

354
00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:47.880
obviously a demo with a
dinosaur that he goes over,

355
00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:51.090
you know, goes over. It
can look under it and

356
00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:56.730
you can hide in grass.
I think that the, I

357
00:21:56.730 --> 00:21:59.760
like the comment about peeking
around something, because that is

358
00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:01.680
the thing, like, it sounds
silly. Like there's so many

359
00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:04.170
goals, there's so many end
points, but just simply being

360
00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:07.710
able to peek around. I
I've, I've heard that there

361
00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:09.570
may be a year from
now. We're going to see

362
00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:14.400
all webcams will have an
infrared component, both for facial

363
00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:17.490
recognition for windows. Hello. But
like, I just bought a

364
00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:19.020
new webcam. So the webcam
that you and I are

365
00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:21.360
chatting with right now is
a, is a logic nine

366
00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:25.140
30. And I had thought
webcams were a solved problem.

367
00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:26.790
Like I'm like, Oh, okay.
And I haven't even thought

368
00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:28.890
about webcams in two or
three years. I had a

369
00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:31.860
logic tech nine, 10 is
a perfectly good webcam, but

370
00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:35.670
I just got this nine
30. It's got onboard H

371
00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:38.730
two 64 encoding. So it's
not my machine. Doesn't do

372
00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:41.550
any of the work. The
next one, the ones that

373
00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:43.890
will work with windows. Hello.
I understand we'll need H

374
00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:47.580
IRR so that they can,
they can track your face.

375
00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:49.380
So it's almost like we're
starting to get where a,

376
00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:52.410
a tiny little connect is
going to be available as

377
00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:55.830
an off the shelf, consumer
webcam. And that will make

378
00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:59.100
augmented reality that much easier.
I'm I'm sitting right now.

379
00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:01.150
I'm looking at a nine
30 because I already have

380
00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:05.640
one that they're amazing. Best
freaking camera. Yes, it is.

381
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:11.220
It's ridiculously wide view and
everything always looks good. It's

382
00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:14.340
awesome. And right next to
it is the IRR camera

383
00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:16.770
from, from the Oculus. It's
just sitting right next to

384
00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:20.070
it. So I already have
something like that. Great minds

385
00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:22.740
think alike. I do want
to point out that there's

386
00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:26.130
a difference though, between moving
physically in virtual reality and

387
00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:28.590
seated people are saying that
the movement thing might take

388
00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:32.100
awhile to figure out, but
sitting in, in a, in

389
00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:35.070
a scenario like this one
with elite dangerous, the space

390
00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:38.220
adventure game, we're saying that
that's the killer thing. Like,

391
00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:40.740
okay, maybe I can't stand
up, but at least I

392
00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:44.040
can look around a cockpit
of a space ship. Elite

393
00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:47.900
is amazing earth. I have,
I have, I have a

394
00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:51.890
leads with the DK two
and a choice stick with

395
00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:56.560
a throttle stick, like a
huge, like huge metal. It's

396
00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:58.960
like, it's just like a
proper, like it came out

397
00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:02.020
of us, came out of
F 16. Oh my Oh,

398
00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:04.450
wow. That is legit. Okay.
So she's got a complete,

399
00:24:04.810 --> 00:24:08.860
full on metal. It looks
like it's headquartered. Yes. And

400
00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:11.590
this is only half of
it because the throttle it's

401
00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:15.460
the other half, it's like
double throttle with, with switches

402
00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:20.320
in the game, you see
your hands, but they're not

403
00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:23.890
real. They're not getting tracked
even though the DK to

404
00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:26.680
contract them, but they support
the good one as well.

405
00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:29.050
And they don't track that.
What they do is really,

406
00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:33.130
really clever. So there was
another camp. I can't remember

407
00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:36.580
the name that came before
this that also had support

408
00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:38.650
for the Oculus. And the
amazing thing when you're in

409
00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:42.340
a cockpit is being able
to look around you 360

410
00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:45.430
degrees. And, and, and actually,
you know, when you were

411
00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:48.850
playing ring commander, when I
was a kid or whatever

412
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.600
people are playing now with
simulators really, really want to

413
00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:55.510
like the guys just flown
off your screen and you

414
00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:58.270
want to look at it,
right. And you can actually

415
00:24:58.270 --> 00:25:02.080
do this. You can move
your, your head and go,

416
00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:06.790
Whoa, that just flew off.
Let me turn around. And

417
00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:10.300
with the leap, not only
can you do that, but

418
00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:12.970
all of the UI, all
of the HUD of the

419
00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:16.750
cockpit is accessible when you
look at it. So if

420
00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:19.150
you want to access button,
no, you just look at

421
00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:22.000
it. Yeah. Well, yes. And
then you can control it

422
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.340
with a keyboard or with
a choice tech, if you

423
00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:27.340
have enough sticks, which I
do, because it doesn't tend

424
00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:30.460
to stacks, but basically have
your hands on the choice.

425
00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:33.490
Second, you look on your
left side for the communications

426
00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:36.460
HUD, and you will activate
because you're looking at it

427
00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:39.640
with an right. And then
you can just Tony stark

428
00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:43.060
style. Yes, exactly. All of
the HUD is like that.

429
00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:46.210
We're not seeing you. I
just want to point out

430
00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:48.880
that Andre is absolutely beaming
right now. And I think

431
00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:51.700
that's what makes people like
about augmented reality. Don't they?

432
00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:58.060
Yeah. I mean, it's, it's,
it gets tiring. After a

433
00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:01.810
while we come clean with
it physically and mentally, it's

434
00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:05.980
kinda like after a while
you get tired, but we're

435
00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:09.610
talking about technology, an Oculus,
that's still in a prototype

436
00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:14.920
phase, developer edition, not even
a consumer version and already

437
00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:21.100
spending hours, playing elect, landing
and flying. There's a lot

438
00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:24.550
of experiences that are still
hard to make. People are

439
00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:28.360
still trying to figure out
how to make experiences and

440
00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:31.570
content for this. But other
experiences, you already know that

441
00:26:31.570 --> 00:26:34.270
they're were just waiting for
this right wing commander, elite

442
00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:38.080
stuff like this. Like you
totally know. What do you

443
00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:39.670
think this is going to
do to people's brains though?

444
00:26:39.670 --> 00:26:42.610
Like, I know that I
kind of am saddened when

445
00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:46.590
I'm kids walk by and
at a mall and their

446
00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:49.770
brains are plugged into a
Nintendo three DS. And I'm

447
00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:51.870
thinking, what is this doing
to this little person's brain

448
00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:54.240
that they are on this
thing for five hours a

449
00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:58.200
day. I don't let my
kids do that. It's a

450
00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:01.140
nine year old gonna do
jacked into an Oculus. And

451
00:27:01.150 --> 00:27:04.440
I mean, that's, that's, that's
going to change their brain.

452
00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:08.330
Yes. But depends on the
content. Depends on the experiences.

453
00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:11.150
Right? It's going to change
the branding. I have no

454
00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:14.630
idea what the effect is
going to be, but there's

455
00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:18.590
this game keep talking and
nobody explodes Keep talking and

456
00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:21.530
nobody explodes. That's the name
of the game. Yes. Which

457
00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:25.430
is amazing game for Oculus,
where you have to diffuse

458
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:29.840
a Barb with in pairs.
So one of you is

459
00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:32.330
sitting with the Oculus, looking
at the BOM and the

460
00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:35.180
other one sitting with the
manual and you have to

461
00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:39.530
describe what the vom looks
like. Oh, they can't see

462
00:27:39.530 --> 00:27:43.610
it. No, you're explaining. And
they're going through the mine

463
00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:47.150
manual and telling you what
to do basically. That's it.

464
00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:49.910
Now that's interesting because this
isn't just a, put a

465
00:27:49.910 --> 00:27:51.800
helmet on your head and
disappear kind of a game.

466
00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:54.140
There's a social aspect to
it. It's a clever mechanic.

467
00:27:55.100 --> 00:28:00.230
Yeah. It's, it's new content,
different content made just for

468
00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:03.500
the Oculus. You can do
this. This is completely new.

469
00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:06.770
It's an experience that he
could never do with any

470
00:28:06.770 --> 00:28:09.830
other medium. Right. Cause you're,
you're acting as if you're

471
00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:12.740
separate, you're away somewhere. And
they're explaining over the phone

472
00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:16.640
to you. Exactly. Cut the
red wire, Cut the red

473
00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:19.970
wire and the fuse. Like
you, there's two people pairing

474
00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:22.610
up, but it's that they've
done a bunch of tests

475
00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:27.140
with the couples, which is
funny because I, yeah, absolutely.

476
00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:29.270
Right. I'm thinking about like
where my wife and I

477
00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:31.340
were going to die. There's
no way we're going to

478
00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:35.570
get this thing taken apart.
Exactly. It's, it's pretty much

479
00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:40.310
like that, but, but it's
amazing. It's, it's it's this

480
00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:44.000
is the thing, like it's
gonna ruin brains. Yes. Like

481
00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:48.800
funds ruin brains and everything
changes your brain. I can't

482
00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:51.830
even imagine. I mean, people
are going to be different,

483
00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:55.580
right. For growing up with
this stuff. But then again,

484
00:28:55.580 --> 00:29:00.830
imagine the content that can
be done instead of, I

485
00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:04.190
mean like the experiences that
he can experience because you

486
00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:06.410
can't go somewhere, but you
can see it and you

487
00:29:06.410 --> 00:29:08.510
can experience that. You can
touch it and you can

488
00:29:08.510 --> 00:29:12.920
examine it. Right. So in
that sense that the content

489
00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:17.240
that can be done is
amazing. And I mean, it's

490
00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:21.380
like there was another, there
was another game, not directly

491
00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:28.040
with the Oculus, but with
smart sensors where you would

492
00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:30.260
have a book and you
were playing a game in

493
00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:33.050
your like Harry Potter kind of
magic thing in every time

494
00:29:33.050 --> 00:29:35.330
you have to cast a
spell or do anything, you

495
00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:36.920
have to open the right
page of the book. It's

496
00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:41.740
a physical book and touch
the right combination of, to

497
00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:45.340
launch dispel to do your
thing. Right? And the book

498
00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:47.230
is wired up with a
bunch of sensors and the

499
00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:50.080
electric paint and everything. So
to the tech touches and

500
00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:52.300
to detect all of this
stuff and send it directly

501
00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:54.310
to the game. So now
you playing a game and

502
00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:58.810
interacting with physical objects. Now
I imagine that that type

503
00:29:58.810 --> 00:30:04.240
of interaction with the Oculus,
right? So there's, there's, I

504
00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:08.560
mean, there's all kinds of
contents that we can't imagine,

505
00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:11.680
which is why I say
that, like the people that

506
00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:14.830
are growing up with this
stuff, the next generation, that's

507
00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:17.770
going to, the people that
are seeing this in a

508
00:30:17.770 --> 00:30:22.210
consumer way, they're going to
start seeing the world differently.

509
00:30:22.390 --> 00:30:25.570
Yes. But there are going
to start producing content that

510
00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:30.310
we can never think about
because we are bound by

511
00:30:30.730 --> 00:30:34.950
our current experiences, which is
why. Yeah. One of the

512
00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:37.800
games that's been blowing my
mind lately is life is

513
00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:40.860
strange. Have you played that
Life is strange. No, not

514
00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:44.670
yet. It's, it's kind of
like walking dead or game

515
00:30:44.670 --> 00:30:46.710
of Thrones. It's one of
those kinds of, it feels

516
00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:50.370
a little bit like a
telltale games game, but basically

517
00:30:50.370 --> 00:30:53.610
it's about, it's a, it's
a simulation of being in

518
00:30:53.610 --> 00:30:57.480
high school and you are
a teenage girl and there's

519
00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:59.670
all this anxiety and everything.
And then I don't know,

520
00:30:59.670 --> 00:31:01.710
15 or 20 minutes into
the game, very short amount.

521
00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:04.080
I'm not giving any spoilers
away. She discovers that she

522
00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:06.960
can turn back time, which
I think is what, every

523
00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:09.420
time, whatever, whatever teenage girl
or teenage boy would want

524
00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:10.950
to do, which is like,
Oh, I just said something

525
00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:14.400
dumb in class. Let's back
up and let's do that

526
00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:18.990
over again. And then, then,
then it becomes a big

527
00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:21.990
conspiracy and she discovers a
huge conspiracy theory and then

528
00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:25.920
spends multiple, you know, it's
an episodic game. Oh, wow.

529
00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:28.830
She has to uncover this
and you should try this.

530
00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:30.840
I'd love to talk to
you about it sometime. It

531
00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:33.270
feels like, you know, the
walking dead or game of

532
00:31:33.270 --> 00:31:36.120
Thrones type games, it's kind
of 3d. It also happens

533
00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:39.330
to be an Oregon, which
is, which is cool. Cause

534
00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:44.490
I'm an Oregon. But if
you could play as a

535
00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:47.550
teenage girl or someone, I
am not a teenage girl.

536
00:31:48.150 --> 00:31:49.920
If someone that you are
not, you know what I

537
00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:53.100
mean? If you could play
mass effect as an alien,

538
00:31:53.910 --> 00:31:56.160
you know what I mean?
And be not just first-person,

539
00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:58.530
but be that alien, look
in the mirror, look in

540
00:31:58.530 --> 00:32:02.010
the mirror and see that
you're a lizard that now

541
00:32:02.010 --> 00:32:04.890
we're talking. Yes. That was
one of the first demos

542
00:32:04.890 --> 00:32:08.450
actually that came out, not
a demo, but there was

543
00:32:09.210 --> 00:32:13.110
one of the, the hack
weeks at unity where all

544
00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:15.060
the developers get together for
a week and just hack

545
00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:18.360
on stuff. The first week
that we had an Oculus

546
00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:21.390
at the office, the first
hack week, someone went and

547
00:32:21.390 --> 00:32:25.170
did a that and be
just, yes, but look in

548
00:32:25.170 --> 00:32:30.270
the mirror as not you
as your opposite gender. Oh

549
00:32:30.270 --> 00:32:32.670
wow. Just as promote gender.
Wow. That's insane. Yeah. So

550
00:32:32.670 --> 00:32:35.400
it's like, you know, like,
no, but that's just yourself.

551
00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:38.850
It's a field that creates
empathy. Yeah. There was, there

552
00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:42.560
was also an experiment where
people would do two peoples

553
00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:47.480
lying down. We'll put the
Oculus on and then they

554
00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:51.620
would, they would look through
the other person's kind of

555
00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:56.530
perspective. Oh, so you swap
your eyes. Basically. I look

556
00:32:56.530 --> 00:32:58.840
out of my eyes, see
the Oculus, which is a

557
00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:00.790
view out of your eyes,
looking back at me. And

558
00:33:00.790 --> 00:33:03.370
when we look at each
other, Yes. Something like that

559
00:33:03.370 --> 00:33:06.460
too, to really give you
a bad sense of out

560
00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:11.350
of body, because the brain
believes it's amazing for all

561
00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:15.280
of the stuff that you
know, your required patterns and

562
00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:18.250
all of this stuff, you're
wired to identify. It's amazing

563
00:33:18.250 --> 00:33:21.340
how in half a second,
you put on that thing.

564
00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:24.100
If the environment is well
done, it not even have

565
00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:26.530
to be well done because
you think I didn't have

566
00:33:26.530 --> 00:33:29.170
that much going for it,
but it still gave you

567
00:33:29.170 --> 00:33:32.620
that as soon as you
step into it, you can't

568
00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:35.680
even do anything. It's just
looking around and it's kind

569
00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:39.130
of like, So let me,
as we, as we wrap

570
00:33:39.130 --> 00:33:40.990
up here, let me put
you on the spot. It

571
00:33:40.990 --> 00:33:45.550
is June of 2015. When
am I going to be

572
00:33:45.550 --> 00:33:48.040
able to walk into a
store and buy an amazing

573
00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:51.010
off the shelf, virtual reality
thing and have an amazing

574
00:33:51.010 --> 00:33:53.260
experience, put a date on
it and we'll come back.

575
00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:55.120
And we'll when it happens.
And we'll see if you

576
00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:59.170
were right. You can buy
it. I will bet too.

577
00:33:59.230 --> 00:34:03.430
In June, 2016, Seriously, one year
from now, I'll be able

578
00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:06.730
to have a great experience
for the chroma Experience, the

579
00:34:06.730 --> 00:34:12.340
great experience. That's a problem.
You can actually have great

580
00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:16.450
experiences right now, small, small,
like the keeps talking, nobody

581
00:34:16.450 --> 00:34:18.610
explodes like you lead, like
all of these, you can

582
00:34:18.610 --> 00:34:22.570
already have them. Which means
that when the consumer version

583
00:34:23.290 --> 00:34:29.650
ships, which I tune 2016,
that's your feeling when it'll

584
00:34:29.650 --> 00:34:32.620
be ready, I'm a pessimist.
So I would say September,

585
00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:37.180
because that's traditionally when they
ended up, That means Christmas,

586
00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:43.180
Christmas, next year, they're saying
first quarter, next year, First

587
00:34:43.180 --> 00:34:46.240
quarter of 2016. I'm saying
it's going to be push

588
00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:50.020
it by the end. They've
been good at delivering on,

589
00:34:50.110 --> 00:34:53.890
on, on their, on their
worth of how, when the

590
00:34:53.890 --> 00:34:57.940
deliver, but it's going to
be complicated. Also. It still

591
00:34:57.940 --> 00:35:01.810
annoys me that it's not
wireless for all of the,

592
00:35:01.810 --> 00:35:05.290
yes, we need wire for
bandwidth. I want to, I

593
00:35:05.290 --> 00:35:08.920
want to movable experience. I
want to stand up And

594
00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:11.770
morph. Yeah. It's so hard.
The latency to push that

595
00:35:11.770 --> 00:35:15.250
kind of, you know, it's
every millisecond counts, you know?

596
00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:21.040
Yes. I mean everything like
GPU graphics and everything counts,

597
00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:24.640
but, but, but I want
to move Well, you know,

598
00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:27.340
there's a thing called, have
you seen the Omni Virtuix

599
00:35:28.210 --> 00:35:30.940
I have not. I've played
around with the Samsung gear,

600
00:35:31.450 --> 00:35:36.200
which, which tries to, to,
I mean, it basically, is

601
00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:39.210
this a phone with an
Oculus? Yeah. That would be

602
00:35:39.210 --> 00:35:40.680
an interesting way to walk.
Right? I think we could

603
00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:43.770
see a version of the
iPhone, maybe the iPhone nine

604
00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:47.340
or the iPhone eight. The
screens are already there with

605
00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:50.340
Google cardboard. Right? Google cardboard
is literally just a piece

606
00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:52.680
of cardboard that you hold
up to your eyes and

607
00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:54.330
you put the phone in
and boom, you've got a

608
00:35:54.330 --> 00:35:59.160
poor man's VR. Yeah. And
amazingly it works. Yeah. It's

609
00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:02.690
yeah, it does work. And
also the Virtuix Omni is

610
00:36:02.690 --> 00:36:05.870
like, you know, those discs,
it's a concave disc that

611
00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:07.490
you would like, you know,
the kind of thing that

612
00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:08.930
you, when you were a
kid, you'd be on a,

613
00:36:09.950 --> 00:36:13.310
a sled. You get a
nice, big, giant concave disc.

614
00:36:13.490 --> 00:36:16.550
And you'd go sledding down
in this disc. Imagine that

615
00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:23.120
with supports that lets you
run in place, right. You

616
00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:25.650
run in place and then
you put, you know, you're

617
00:36:25.730 --> 00:36:27.770
supported by the thing and
I'll kind of a harness.

618
00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:30.590
It is the height of
geekiness. You think a segway

619
00:36:30.590 --> 00:36:35.840
looks makes you look like
a dork, but it's amazing

620
00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:38.270
because like, I want to
run in place on this

621
00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:41.030
disc with these special shoes
and then you get the

622
00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:44.480
gun and now you're living
in call of duty. Yes

623
00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:46.850
that's that's that's the demo
that they threw it to

624
00:36:46.850 --> 00:36:50.990
the C I've seen it.
It's it's it's it's gonna

625
00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.180
get there. You know what
it reminds me of it's

626
00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:56.600
like today, if you're an
enthusiast, you can spend a

627
00:36:56.600 --> 00:37:00.650
couple of grand and get
an amazing car simulator. Like

628
00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:03.470
you can have the seat
and the shifter, you know,

629
00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:05.780
people who are always building
a space shuttle in their

630
00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:10.160
garage or a complete flight
simulator, that's going to become

631
00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:12.380
much more common for people.
It's going to be more

632
00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:17.060
accessible. Well, less money. Two
years ago, I was at

633
00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:21.170
the conference in Lisbon called
carpets. And a friend of

634
00:37:21.170 --> 00:37:25.910
mine built an experience with
another friend of them. So

635
00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:28.550
they got together. This guy
builds our kids for a

636
00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:33.320
living because the markets, he
built two Tron bikes. Oh

637
00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:37.730
my goodness. And with the
Oculus Tron and Oculus, that's

638
00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:41.660
everything, You're on the bike
and you, and try the

639
00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:44.480
bike, you know, it's it's
you move it side by

640
00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:47.430
side one side in the
other end, you will, it

641
00:37:47.430 --> 00:37:50.600
will shift directions just like
in, you're playing the game

642
00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:54.920
with the Oculus. That will
not make me nauseous at

643
00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:59.120
all. No, it's actually really,
really good. That's amazing. Well,

644
00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:01.340
thanks so much for sharing
kind of the state of

645
00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:04.670
virtual reality with me. I
really appreciate it. No problem.

646
00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:08.000
This has been another episode
of Hansel minutes and we'll

647
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.290
see you again next week.
