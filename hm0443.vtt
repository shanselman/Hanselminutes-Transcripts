<inaudible> From hanselminutes.com. It's Hanselman.

8
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.640
That's a weekly discussion with
web developer and technologist Scott

9
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.230
Hanselman. This is Lawrence Ryan announcing
show number four 46. In

10
00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.980
this episode, Scott talks with
Damien Edwards about selecting the

11
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:07.190
ultimate developer laptop. Hi, this
is Scott Hanselman. This is

12
00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.230
another episode of Hansel minutes,
and I'm talking with my

13
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.890
good friend and favorite Australian
Damien Edwards, our user I'm

14
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.080
very well. How are you?
I'm pretty good. I just

15
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.710
came back from a business
trip and I took my

16
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.250
surface pro three. It was
my only machine. I used

17
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.370
it for presentations for visual
studio for basically everything it's,

18
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.480
it's turning out to be
pretty decent and surprisingly good

19
00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.590
PC for a, for a
developer. I'm really happy to

20
00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.780
hear that because you and
I have been on the

21
00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.380
fence on what our next
laptop was going to be

22
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.940
for a while. Now, I
think we've been talking about

23
00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.570
this for probably ever since
we got the <inaudible> and

24
00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.020
then the new chips came
out shortly after that. We've

25
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.730
been talking about, you know,
what's the next laptop we're

26
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.530
going to get so that
we would spend our own

27
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.740
money on, because of course
we get hardware from Microsoft

28
00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.240
as part of our jobs,
but I wasn't particularly happy

29
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.220
after a couple of months
with the X one, despite

30
00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.870
it being a great machine,
it was like, wow, you

31
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.900
know, the screen, isn't that
great. And yeah, I can

32
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.500
get better CPU use now.
And I could do with

33
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.890
a little bit more of
this and that. And so

34
00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.470
we've been looking at different
laptops for a while and

35
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.720
you and I have both
pulled the trigger on the

36
00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.640
surface pro three, and I
have to say I've really

37
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.740
enjoyed mine so far as
well. I haven't done a

38
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.500
business trip with it yet
though. Well, let's, let's, let's

39
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.630
parse a little bit there
for people who aren't necessarily

40
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.300
up to our lives. When
we say X one, we're

41
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.770
talking about the Lenovo carbon
X one touch. Yes. There's

42
00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.960
two versions where we call
V one and V two,

43
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.260
that you can tell them
apart because the carbon, next

44
00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.120
one that is V2 has
no physical function keys. It

45
00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.180
just has a capacitive kind
of touch looking thing at

46
00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.150
the top there. Yeah. And
the, what happened between the

47
00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.190
<inaudible>, which was the original
X one, which is a

48
00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.400
fantastic machine. It just happened
to have only a 600

49
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.340
by 900 screen, which is
just too low Rez. I

50
00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.580
really wanted a attend NDP.
They upped that to like

51
00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.860
a super retina, 25, 60
by something ridiculous screen. Yeah.

52
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.350
Which was great. But then
they messed with the keyboard,

53
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.450
moved the caps lock around,
changed everything and generally freak

54
00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.050
people out. I think they
destroyed the touch bed too.

55
00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.780
For me. I actually, I
had the original X one

56
00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.970
touch. I had the touch
pad set up because their

57
00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.910
drivers are, you know, they're
pretty good. They're pretty detailed.

58
00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.220
You can enable a lot
of crazy advanced things, but

59
00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.260
I just turned pretty much
everything off and tried to

60
00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.420
set it up to be
as close to a Mac

61
00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.600
pro touch pad as I
possibly could, which I think

62
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.020
a lot of people will
recognize is without much argument

63
00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.850
that come to the best
touchpad you can get. Right.

64
00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.010
I think that is absolute.
I mean, if in case

65
00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.970
you didn't know, the Mac
touch pad has just been

66
00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.970
tuned to like a fine,
it's just, it is the

67
00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.700
touch pad. It is all
of the touch pads pale

68
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.420
in comparison. Kind of amazing
that it just seems to,

69
00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.580
I mean, I haven't used
one extensively. I've a couple

70
00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.320
of people here have Macs
and occasionally I have to

71
00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.810
do something on land machine
and it just seems to

72
00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.540
naturally work. Whereas the ones
on windows always seem to

73
00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.040
be a bit of a
struggle, but on the X

74
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.230
one, I was able to
turn off a whole bunch

75
00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.670
of stuff and sort of
get it set up so

76
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.800
that it worked pretty much
like a Mac one, but

77
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.530
on the new X one,
I found that there's just

78
00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.020
too much travel in the
touch pad. And when I

79
00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.380
click into travel vertical travel,
it feels hollow. Not, it

80
00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.500
doesn't feel substantial, like it's,
it doesn't resist enough. And

81
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.050
then when it does sort
of get beyond that threshold,

82
00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.720
it goes too far and
it may sound really trivial,

83
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.110
but you know, you deal
with these inputs every day.

84
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.450
And if I'm going to
spend, you know, up to

85
00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:33.330
$2,000 of my own money,
I wanted something that was

86
00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.160
perfect. And you and I
have talked about this a

87
00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.120
lot. Like what is the
perfect developer where could have

88
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.940
half developer, half, you know,
what we do for Microsoft?

89
00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:45.060
What does that perfect device
for us? Oh, and as

90
00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.520
an aside, just do I
get this out? If you

91
00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.330
are a PC person and
you love the Mac touch

92
00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.650
pad, the logic tech touchpad
T six 50 is about

93
00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.990
as close as you can
get to having a portable

94
00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.410
wireless version of a Mac
touch pad for a PC.

95
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.600
It is fantastic. And I
have one on my desk

96
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.790
right now. Cool. Yeah. So
the ultimate developer laptop slash

97
00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.810
PC, it seems so simple
to me. It would have

98
00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.630
the fastest processor. It would
have 16 gigs of Ram

99
00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.700
and it would have a
fast SSD And it would

100
00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:23.250
weigh two pounds. And last
four days, Exactly the battery

101
00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.860
life is, is for me,
that was the big thing.

102
00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.840
Like I was going to
go to Haswell and everyone

103
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.500
was promising 10 hour battery
life. The thing that I

104
00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.770
think I made the mistake
with is I believe the

105
00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.710
hype about battery life. When
they say, when they say

106
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.750
10 hours of battery life,
they mean one of two

107
00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:44.850
things watching a video on
dim on the dumbest brightness

108
00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:47.340
of the screen and the
video, it happens to be

109
00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:52.050
some specially formatted MPEG for
that MP4 that uses the

110
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.200
GPU to do all of
its work. So don't touch

111
00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.440
your laptop and watch a
10 hour movie. And the

112
00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.410
battery will last 10 hours,
right. Or type in a

113
00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.800
text editor while running nothing
else at the dentist, you

114
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.090
know, breakfast. And that's not
what anyone does. No, absolutely

115
00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:10.150
not. And certainly with the
X one, I was finding

116
00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.280
that, you know, sitting on
the couch at the end

117
00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.350
of the day, watching TV,
while you know, doing a

118
00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:15.970
bit of work, it was
either a bit of coding

119
00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.300
and, or some email. And
obviously some browsing, it felt

120
00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.820
like I wasn't even getting
a solid two and a

121
00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:24.310
half hours out of it.
Like it was, it was

122
00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:26.260
running down to the point
of course, windows doesn't even

123
00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.360
let you get down to
zero. It starts yelling at

124
00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.550
you as soon as you
get to 10% left and

125
00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:32.950
at 7%, like it really
starts yelling at you and

126
00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:37.510
basically shuts itself off. Whereas
the surface pro three, which

127
00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:39.850
I've had for a few
weeks now, I stayed home

128
00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:41.770
one day. Cause I wasn't
feeling a hundred percent and

129
00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:43.960
I sort of wobbly, this
is the perfect opportunity. Let

130
00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:47.470
me sit in my den
at home and not plug

131
00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:49.390
in the surface and just
run it from a hundred

132
00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:52.030
percent, doing a normal sort
of email, a little bit

133
00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:54.700
of browsing, a little bit
of coding day. And I

134
00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:58.540
got a solid five and
a half hours before windows

135
00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:01.690
started yelling at me. And
what was interesting is that

136
00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:05.020
I was noting at every
hour, how much percent I

137
00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:06.940
had left, right? So I'd
go down the bottom right

138
00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.280
hand corner, I'd hover over
the battery icon. And I

139
00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.800
would look at what percentage
had left. And it was

140
00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:16.900
incredibly linear as in it
was dropping a consistent, it

141
00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:20.080
was like 18% per hour
on the hour, every single

142
00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.030
time. So I think if
windows would let me run

143
00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:24.010
to zero, which I'm sure
you can configure it to

144
00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:26.260
do that, I think I
would have got, you know,

145
00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:30.220
exactly six hours out of
the surface pro three and

146
00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:32.380
we have the <inaudible> by
the way. So people know

147
00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.870
what was your brightness? So
that though I have my

148
00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:38.890
brightness at the one lower
one level below the level

149
00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.890
before the power settings tell
you that your screen is

150
00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:44.800
too bright for battery. Okay.
So when you, as you

151
00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:48.010
hover over the power icon
down there in the tray,

152
00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:50.560
by the clock, if you
get too high, it says

153
00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:54.730
your brightness might affect battery
life. One notch below One

154
00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:57.070
notch below that. So like
what windows is telling me

155
00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:59.860
is the optimum and mix
between brightness and battery life.

156
00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:04.120
Okay. That makes sense. Yeah.
So I was pretty happy

157
00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:07.540
five and a half hours
on, on this type of

158
00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:09.610
hardware, this form factor. And
you know, we should talk

159
00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:11.410
a little bit more about
surface spray three because people

160
00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:15.640
have probably seen or read
about it and seen videos,

161
00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.160
but until you actually have
one a news one every

162
00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.380
day, I think it's hard
to appreciate just what they

163
00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:23.350
managed to do in this
device. Well, I went to

164
00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:27.100
this, this conference was a
designer conference and interestingly, I

165
00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:30.100
saw two kinds of machines
at this conference. I saw

166
00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:33.760
MacBook airs. I saw virtually
no MacBook pros. Everyone had

167
00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:37.390
an, either an air or
a surface, mostly surface twos,

168
00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:40.090
surface pro twos. I saw
a lot of those and

169
00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:44.320
the people who had them
were game developers. They had

170
00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:47.320
the, they ran unity on
them and they ran. They

171
00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.960
wanted to be able to
run, ran, ran Maya and

172
00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:53.140
different three D modeling things.
So it seems like while

173
00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:56.940
web developers favor max, I
saw a lot of these

174
00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:00.660
surface pros with a pen
and people doing design work

175
00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:03.500
for game. I see. So
they liked the form factor

176
00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:06.740
because of the pen really.
I mean as game designers.

177
00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:09.920
Okay. And of course, if
you look at the, the

178
00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:13.850
penny arcade fellow, the cartoonist
stuff, he's always talking about

179
00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:15.530
the pen. So I think
there's a class of art

180
00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:19.220
artists that a laptop with
a pen that isn't really

181
00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:22.190
a tablet is really what
you want to get. Now,

182
00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:25.430
I like the size of
the air. It is, it

183
00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:28.990
is within a few grams
of the size of the

184
00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:31.970
surface, but I'm realizing for
what I do. And traveling,

185
00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:35.240
being able to remove the
keyboard is way more useful

186
00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.890
than I thought it would
be. I will call you

187
00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:39.350
out a little bit. The
MacBook air is not within

188
00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:41.870
a few grams of the
surface pro three. No, not

189
00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:44.090
by a long shot. What
are the sizes? So the

190
00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:49.310
surface pro three without the
keyboard is about 1.7 pounds.

191
00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:53.480
Okay. And the Mac book
air is about three pounds.

192
00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:56.930
It was kind of the
originally ultra book. Yes. We

193
00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:59.060
demonstrated this when we did
the launch of the surface

194
00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:01.130
pro three were by putting
both of them on a

195
00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:03.680
scale. And you know, it
was contrived as people may

196
00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:06.950
think that is the surface.
Pro three is a lot

197
00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:09.920
lighter. Now, when you add
the keyboard, it does tip

198
00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.900
it up to just over
two pounds. The keyboard is

199
00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:15.260
quite substantial because you know,
there's a lot of stuff

200
00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.750
going on inside a proper
typing keyboard. And it has

201
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:20.840
one of those new precision
track pads as well. Well,

202
00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:23.180
according to this site, looking
at a site, now it

203
00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:26.660
says surface pro with type
covers 2.4 pounds Mac book,

204
00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:29.660
air 2.96. So it looks
like a little more than

205
00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:33.020
a half a pound, Half
a pound. Yeah. So I'm,

206
00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.660
I agree with you. I
certainly finding that removing the

207
00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:38.750
keyboard when I'm sort of
sitting back and going into

208
00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:41.330
just sort of lounge mode
or here's a great anecdote

209
00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:45.380
this weekend, I had to
clean my coffee machine. The

210
00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:47.300
little light came on, and
of course I can never

211
00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:49.760
remember what the process is,
is a complicated sequence of

212
00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:51.230
things you have to go
through to do it. So

213
00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:53.810
I usually grab a tablet
or a laptop and I

214
00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:55.670
look it up on the
website, open the PDF. And

215
00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:57.320
then I sit there for
half an hour and clean

216
00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:00.110
the machine. But with the
surface pro three, I just

217
00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:02.570
whip the keyboard off, bring
up I E in the

218
00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:06.920
immersive Metro non Metro mode.
And I open the PDF

219
00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:09.760
and I sit there with
the surface in one hand,

220
00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:12.680
cause it's pretty comfortable to
do that in portrait and,

221
00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:15.050
you know, using the confirmation
and the other to do

222
00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:18.140
the cleaning. And it just
works. Like I'm finding it

223
00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:21.590
around the house as a
tablet. I much prefer it

224
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:23.930
because you know, the screen
is much bigger, like an

225
00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:27.050
extra two inches on the
diagonal for the screen results

226
00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:30.230
in a much more readable
sort of tablet. In my

227
00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:32.690
mind, it feels like a
magazine. Would you use your

228
00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:36.200
iPad for? So I only
have an original iPad. I

229
00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:39.500
never upgraded. And I found
this weighs about the same

230
00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:42.350
as the original iPad, but
I get a screen that's

231
00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:44.480
like I said, quite a
lot larger with obviously a

232
00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.820
much better quality, you know,
higher pixels per inch and

233
00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:49.160
whatnot. And it's a lot
faster. I mean, this is

234
00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.740
an <inaudible> ultra book, you
know, a genuine ISO and

235
00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:54.670
ultra book. This thing is
as fast as my X

236
00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:57.940
one carbon, it's actually faster.
And it's actually as fast

237
00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:01.930
for doing visual studio compilation
as my desktop, I use

238
00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:04.000
here at work. That might
be a good segue to

239
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.340
start talking about the differences
and what it means in

240
00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:08.350
a developer to be a
developer and using one of

241
00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:10.350
these devices. Yeah. Yeah. Now,
one thing I do want

242
00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:12.240
to address though, that is
just it's we can't really

243
00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:15.960
get past it. We, we
are two random dudes on

244
00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:18.510
the, you know, talking on
Skype here right now, who

245
00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:22.110
happened to work for Microsoft.
So someone who's made it

246
00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:24.510
this far, you know, there's
11, 12 minutes into the

247
00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:27.120
podcast are going to be
like, okay, I guess this

248
00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:29.280
is the episode of Hansel
minutes where the two Microsoft

249
00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:33.090
people try to sell me
the surface pro to be

250
00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:37.230
clear. We do work for
Microsoft to also be clear.

251
00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:41.070
We bought the surface pros
with our own money. We

252
00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:46.500
did not receive any discounts.
I bought mine@microsoftstore.com. We get

253
00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:50.250
laptops for work. We're allowed
one new laptop every three

254
00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:54.240
years. And I have had
two laptops at Microsoft. I

255
00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:58.740
had <inaudible> ThinkPad and I
have a, an X one

256
00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:02.070
carbon, but both you and
I bought our surface pros

257
00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:06.270
after probably what months of
deliberation and discussion. Yeah, well,

258
00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:08.670
we were very, I was
looking very closely at the

259
00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:12.960
Asus Zen book, a UX,
I think it's the 31,

260
00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.330
the eight of book prime.
Right. And I was looking

261
00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:20.070
at the, the, the Samsung,
yes, The series nine plus

262
00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:23.940
whatever it's called. And those
were both, you know, they're

263
00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:27.480
very good laptops. And indeed
the ultra, the USCIS has

264
00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:31.140
a very fast ultra book
processor in it. In fact,

265
00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:34.860
it's the, the fastest rated.
It was the Intel four,

266
00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:38.130
five, five ATU, which is
a core a seven, but

267
00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:41.550
it has 28 Watts TDP.
It's rated at a thermal

268
00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:44.340
dispersion rating. Like how much
heat it has to dissipate

269
00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:47.940
when it's running at 28
Watts. Now that's versus the

270
00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:50.040
CPU as you find in
the surface pro and the

271
00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:53.610
Samsung and even the X
one at 15 Watts. So

272
00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:57.060
you're talking about a lot
more heat because it's using

273
00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:58.740
a lot more energy and,
you know, but getting you

274
00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:01.470
more power as a result,
but it turned out the

275
00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:04.650
Seuss didn't have a TPM,
which is the trusted platform

276
00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:07.950
module chip, right. And for
us, you know, connecting to

277
00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:10.920
VPN all the time and
wanting to use BitLocker a

278
00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:14.610
TPM is I certainly would
always choose a machine with

279
00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:16.410
a TPM. Every one, without
it, if I'm doing any

280
00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:18.780
type of work, If you're
a VP entering into work

281
00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:22.350
and your work has any
kind of sophisticated VPN, or

282
00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:24.480
you use a smart card
or a smart card reader,

283
00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:26.400
I wanted to be able
to, you want it to

284
00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.740
be able to VPN in
with a smart card where

285
00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:32.310
the smart card is virtual.
Yes, exactly. So it's inside

286
00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:34.500
the TPM effectively, rather than
me having to plug it

287
00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:36.750
in every time, which means
I can't get in the

288
00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:38.940
building. Cause I invariably leave
it plugged into the reader

289
00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:40.440
and then I go outside
and come back in and

290
00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:43.610
can't get in again. So
I really enjoyed that. The,

291
00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:45.860
the, the point there is
that while we do work

292
00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:49.680
for Microsoft, we bought these
ourselves, make your own decisions.

293
00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:52.250
You guys who are listening
to us guys and gals

294
00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:56.000
know that we, we tell
it like it is, I

295
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.740
don't really care if you
buy a surface or not.

296
00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:03.920
If you don't, that's just
more surfaces for me. So,

297
00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:05.690
Oh, and actually, Hey, one
of the thing before we

298
00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:09.620
get into the developer specific
performance stuff, you know, I

299
00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:13.520
thought the kickstand was a
gimmick. I really did. I

300
00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:16.280
have a, I have a,
a, an iPad air. And

301
00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:18.920
I always used to tell
people how great the magnetic

302
00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:21.100
case was. Cause you could
fold it backwards and then

303
00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:23.270
it would turn into a
little triangle and that would

304
00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:26.570
allow you to prop the
thing up. Having a kickstand

305
00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:29.600
on a tablet is really
cool idea. I was on

306
00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:33.350
an airplane for like 12
hours day before yesterday, and

307
00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:36.020
not only was able to
take the, take the keyboard

308
00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:37.880
off and use the tablet
and watch movies. And I

309
00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:40.430
watched it for the entire
time. Cause if you just

310
00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:42.620
watching movies, the battery life
is fantastic. But check this

311
00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:46.880
out. There was no television,
no video screen on the

312
00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:49.490
flight from Washington D C.
So I had a six

313
00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:53.030
and a half hour flight
with no TV. I took

314
00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:56.390
the kickstand and put it
into the pocket of the

315
00:15:56.390 --> 00:16:00.500
seat, back in front of
me and hung it up

316
00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:02.540
at the top at the
level at the, as the

317
00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:05.960
screen usually is. And people
thought that it was integrated

318
00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:07.610
into like people who would
walk by. We're like, how

319
00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:10.280
come he has a TV?
That is hilarious. And it's

320
00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:13.160
12 inch screen. I mean,
did you cause a ruckus

321
00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:16.070
on the plane? I did
cause a ruckus people were

322
00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:18.260
impressed with my video collection
because I had the little

323
00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:22.490
SD card because I popped
in the 64 gig mini

324
00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:25.040
SD card and bought some
movies with me. Right. So

325
00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:27.170
I was living the dream
while everyone else was reading

326
00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:30.130
the sky mall. And did
you have your Bluetooth headphones

327
00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:32.500
as well? I did, but
I was told that they

328
00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:35.560
would rather, that I use
it plugged in Really that's

329
00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:38.080
interesting. Cause I have been
on a flight recently, a

330
00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:40.660
couple of them and they
do make a point now

331
00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:43.720
certainly in America of saying
that you're able to use

332
00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:46.090
electronics from gate to gate.
And what type of electronics

333
00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:48.700
as an, as an interesting
point. One of the great

334
00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:51.040
things about having a convertible
is that you still can't

335
00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:54.490
use a laptop from gate
to gate. For whatever reason.

336
00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:55.690
I don't know what the
reason is. I think it's

337
00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:59.230
because they're heavier. They don't
like them being in the

338
00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:02.020
aisle. And because you generally
have to have the tray

339
00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:03.940
down to use them, a
lot of people do you

340
00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:05.800
still have to have the
train, try out for take

341
00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:07.810
up and landing. And so
I think they say the

342
00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:09.940
smaller devices are okay because
in an emergency you just

343
00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:11.170
throw them on the floor
and get out. But if

344
00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:13.330
you have an unwieldy laptop,
it can be, you know,

345
00:17:13.330 --> 00:17:15.610
take you precious seconds to
put it away. Right. And

346
00:17:15.610 --> 00:17:17.650
so one of the great
thing about the surface pro

347
00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:19.420
is you can just flip
the keyboard around to the

348
00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:22.000
back. When the, when they're
telling you to put your

349
00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.070
leg, you had laptops away,
use it as a tablet.

350
00:17:24.070 --> 00:17:25.810
And then, you know, when
everyone sits down, you flip

351
00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:27.700
it out again and continue
on your way. That is

352
00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:31.450
actually exactly what happened. The,
the flight attendant came by

353
00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:33.880
and said, sir, you need
to put your laptop away.

354
00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:35.350
And then I kind of
did it. I was a

355
00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:37.450
little obnoxious of me, but
I just ripped the keyboard

356
00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:41.080
off and stuck it in
and she goes, Oh, and

357
00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:42.940
then just moved along. So
I thought that was pretty

358
00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:45.430
awesome. So I was able
to watch movies, basically wheels

359
00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:48.010
up to wheels down That's
yeah. That I actually really

360
00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:49.710
enjoyed that feature of it
and have had to watch

361
00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:52.320
other people put their laptops
away while I smugly continue

362
00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:55.580
to use my surface, which
is kind of nice. So

363
00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.510
performance wise, I went and
bought the, the surface dock.

364
00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:02.450
Cause I wanted to really
give it a go as,

365
00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:06.590
as a desktop replacement. How
are you finding the I

366
00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:09.820
seven processor and the speed
in this thing generally? So

367
00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:12.920
Yeah, I, one of these
guys who likes to have

368
00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:15.470
a desktop when I'm at
my desk. So, you know,

369
00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:17.060
I think a few people
have seen the photo of

370
00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:19.040
my set up here at
work where I have four

371
00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:23.630
monitors. I have three 24
inch widescreen monitors. I'm sort

372
00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:26.810
of at eye level. And
then underneath the center monitor,

373
00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:30.590
I have a 27 inch
touch monitor sort of resting

374
00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:32.510
on the desk, but tilt
it up. Cause it has

375
00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:33.800
one of those stands where
you can tilt it up,

376
00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:35.930
cause it's touch. And then
my keyboard in front of

377
00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:37.880
it. So I have this
sort of, you know, enterprise

378
00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:41.240
looking command center, which I
really like having, when I'm

379
00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:42.980
standing at my desk and
at home, I have a

380
00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:46.040
desktop as well. So I
do not use the surface

381
00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:49.070
as like my one machine
to rule them all. But

382
00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:50.840
that said, I do do
a fair bit of coding

383
00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:53.180
on it. And obviously I'm,
I'm doing this call right

384
00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:56.390
now on it. When we
do the Espino community standups,

385
00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:58.850
which we've just started, which
is a Google hangout. I

386
00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:02.060
run that completely from my
surface, including with, you know,

387
00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:04.580
external high resolution cameras and
you know, all that type

388
00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:07.160
of stuff to get that
looking good. And it handles

389
00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:09.260
it, you know, with a
plum, this is a genuine

390
00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:13.490
core. I seven it's the
46 50 you. Now that

391
00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:16.280
chip was released about a
year ago. Now it's actually

392
00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:19.700
an old chip, but it
is the most expensive and

393
00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:24.140
most high-performing version of the
<inaudible> ultra book chips that

394
00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:28.430
are at 15 Watts TDP.
And it gives you the

395
00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:32.570
Intel HD 5,000 graphics. So
more of the CPU die

396
00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:35.000
is kind of allocated to
the graphics side in terms

397
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.370
of how much power they'll
put through it. But it

398
00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:40.250
runs at a base clock
speed of 1.7 gigahertz, but

399
00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:45.890
overclocks to 3.3 gigahertz when
you're doing single core type

400
00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:48.620
of stuff. So to give
you a comparison, I have

401
00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:51.380
on my desktop here, it's
a core I seven Sandy

402
00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:54.800
bridge. So that's the third
generation or second generation I

403
00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:59.090
think of the <inaudible> desktops
and it's the <inaudible> 26

404
00:19:59.090 --> 00:20:00.830
50 or something like that.
So it's a pretty good

405
00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:03.500
<inaudible> chip. You know, it's
a genuine quad core with

406
00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:08.240
hyper-threading. And if I download
a register windows source code

407
00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:11.330
from GitHub and I do
a command line compile of

408
00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:15.140
that solution from cold, my
desktop and my surface pro

409
00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:18.020
three complete in the same
amount of time. So does

410
00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:20.930
that mean that the build
system is not effectively using

411
00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:25.280
all those processors? So it's
basically it's as multi-threaded as

412
00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:27.980
it can be and the
additional course don't matter. That's

413
00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:30.890
true. So if I then
turn on, multi-core build on

414
00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:33.770
both the desktop does pull
ahead by about three seconds,

415
00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:36.650
cause it has double the
number of actual cause. So

416
00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:39.110
it goes to about a,
a 13 second build while

417
00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:42.650
the tablet stays at 15
to 16 seconds. But my,

418
00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:45.710
the surface pro three, sorry,
my Lenovo X one carbon

419
00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:49.840
touch I have the first
that could do at best

420
00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:54.130
about a 22nd build. So
my surface pro three is

421
00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:58.990
at least 25% faster when
doing sort of raw compilation

422
00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:02.470
of a fairly complicated C
plus plus project. Then my

423
00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:06.900
Lenovo X one carbon touch.
So you keep saying TDP

424
00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:10.530
is thermal design point or
certain thermal design power. That

425
00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:13.710
is the maximum amount of
heat that a CPU can

426
00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:17.430
produce. Yeah, it's basically the
max, it's a writing for

427
00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:20.580
the entire system that says,
this is how much hate

428
00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:23.370
you have to dissipate from
this unit, from the CPU

429
00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:25.620
and graphics card. In this
case, in order for this

430
00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:29.640
to operate at normal sort
of ratings. After this rate,

431
00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:33.030
we're going to thermally throttle
the CPU so that it

432
00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:35.130
doesn't get so hot because
I think a lot of

433
00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:38.610
people don't really realize just
how hot a laptop CPU

434
00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:42.840
gets under normal use sort
of a, an ultra book

435
00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:47.460
<inaudible> will easily get to
80 degrees centigrade very quickly.

436
00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:50.400
When you start doing CPU
intensive tasks. When I say

437
00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:53.310
quickly, I mean within a
couple of seconds, it'll get

438
00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:55.140
up to 80 degrees centigrade
and sort of sit there.

439
00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:57.540
If you're pegging it at
a hundred percent CPU, once

440
00:21:57.540 --> 00:21:59.880
you're getting above 90 degrees
centigrade, that's when you start

441
00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:02.670
to get into fem shut
down territory or thermal throttling,

442
00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:06.240
I should say where the
firmware on the CPU will

443
00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:07.620
start saying, Hey, it's getting
a bit hot. I need

444
00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:10.470
to run slower. So there's
less electrons going through me

445
00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:14.580
and thus creating heat. Now
the X one I found

446
00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:16.650
would get very hot when
I use it on my

447
00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:20.040
lap. It has a carbon
fiber chassis, but the vent

448
00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:22.860
is located in one very
specific location on the left

449
00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:24.780
hand side. And if I'm
sitting on my couch and

450
00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:28.140
shorts using the X one,
I would, it would be

451
00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:30.330
uncomfortable. Okay, I'd have to
move it around because it

452
00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:32.670
would get quite hot and
the fan would get quite

453
00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:36.450
loud. And the surface pro
three being a, an <inaudible>

454
00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:39.990
in a much more family
constrained chassis. Cause it is

455
00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:43.350
so ridiculously thin does have
a similar result if I

456
00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:47.640
push it hardly as hard,
but because all the graphic,

457
00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:49.980
all the chips are up
in the screen. I don't

458
00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:53.000
feel it on my lap.
Right, right. Because it's, it's,

459
00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:55.320
it's the opposite of a
laptop in the sense of

460
00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:58.440
you show those jokes early
on about the surface where

461
00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:00.810
you take the heavy part
and you make that the

462
00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:05.250
vertical part of the laptop.
Well, yeah, I think that

463
00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:07.590
I was a little disappointed,
I must say in the

464
00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:11.610
first few weeks of having
a surface, because I somehow

465
00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:15.060
imagined that it would be
cool, like an iPad, but

466
00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:18.120
as fast as a desktop.
And I spent some time

467
00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:21.150
kind of basically being upset
about that and then, and

468
00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:23.820
then realized kind of, I'm
not trying to be an

469
00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:27.180
apologist, but I am trying
to be a realist that

470
00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:30.630
the laws of physics are
the laws of physics. You

471
00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:32.640
know what I mean? Is
there any so much hate

472
00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:35.160
you can discipline? I have
an <inaudible> seven desktop with

473
00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:38.310
a two 56 gig SSD
and eight gigs plus of

474
00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:41.310
Ram. And now I have
the same thing. That's effectively

475
00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:43.800
the size of my original
iPad or a MacBook air.

476
00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:48.140
And it'll run, you know,
two 24 inch monitors plus

477
00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:51.140
or two thirties even. And
it got a little hot

478
00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:54.440
and I was like, man,
this sucks. I mean, I'm

479
00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:55.940
on, I mean, you know,
I'm being honest. I was

480
00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:57.980
pretty upset about it. And
then, and then I think

481
00:23:57.980 --> 00:23:59.600
it was you actually, that
was just like, Hey, you

482
00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:03.530
know, physics or physics, if
the CPU is under 50%,

483
00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:07.040
it's basically silent. But when
I, what I was doing

484
00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:10.430
was I was, you know,
watching Netflix, downloading email, doing

485
00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:13.670
builds, and then running handbrake
all at the same time

486
00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:19.090
and pissed off about it.
Yeah. And break differently. We'll

487
00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:22.870
we'll peg your CPU and
keep you going. But all

488
00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:25.420
that said, I will say
that as I just mentioned,

489
00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:27.670
this CPU we have in
here is a year old.

490
00:24:27.670 --> 00:24:31.180
It came out in quarter
three, 2013, and Intel has

491
00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:35.950
just announced the public availability
of the brand new core

492
00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:39.550
M processes, which is the
next generation. This is the

493
00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:42.880
Broadwell chips. Currently. Most people
will. If they've bought a

494
00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:45.040
laptop in the last year
will have Haswell, which is

495
00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:48.340
what the surface pro three
is. And they are focused

496
00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:52.480
predominantly on reducing the amount
of heat that is needed

497
00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:55.510
to be dispersed and improving
battery life as a result.

498
00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:57.790
And to give an example,
the first round of CPS,

499
00:24:57.790 --> 00:25:02.080
they released replaced the Y
series of laptop CPS. Now

500
00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:04.960
you and I have the
U series, which is that

501
00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:07.330
they are the ultra book
series, the Y series or

502
00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:11.560
a special, low voltage version
of those. But previously they

503
00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:14.830
were rated at about 12
TDP. And again, the user

504
00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:18.010
rate at a 15, the
new Y series equivalents are

505
00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:22.180
rated at four and a
half Watts of TDP. Now

506
00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:25.120
that is an amazing improvement.
And what that means is

507
00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:28.540
we can now have convertibles
that are somewhat like the

508
00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:32.110
surface pro without a fan.
You can actually create an

509
00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:35.170
x86 machine that isn't an
atom. It is a call

510
00:25:35.170 --> 00:25:38.500
based machine that gets, you
know, similar type of performance,

511
00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:40.330
but without a fan, What
does that mean? That I

512
00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:43.660
regret the purchase of my
surface pro thinking that a

513
00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:46.720
month later, something better will
come up. Sorry. Maybe not.

514
00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:49.240
I mean, that's all personal.
I mean, I can tell

515
00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:51.700
you right off the bat,
when we inevitably do a

516
00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:55.120
refresh of the surface pro
three, with the Broadwell chips,

517
00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:57.850
I will buy one. I
will buy the <inaudible> equivalent

518
00:25:57.850 --> 00:26:00.490
and I will either sell
this one or I'll hand

519
00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:04.480
it down within the family,
because the improvements they're talking

520
00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:07.360
about from this new range
of chips where, you know,

521
00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:10.060
it's where 22 nanometers with
the current generation, the new

522
00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:13.870
generation goes down to 14
nanometers, which again, just relates

523
00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:17.230
to less battery use. They're
saying 20% improvement in battery

524
00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:20.860
life. And obviously a lot
less heat. I will, I'm

525
00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:22.810
all up in that. Like
I want the same chassis

526
00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:25.450
with even less heat and
even more battery life and

527
00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:28.570
still an increase in performance.
They're talking about the specifically

528
00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:31.600
the graphics portion of the
new chips being at least

529
00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:35.590
50% faster than what we
have here. So I'm all

530
00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:39.250
up for that. Hmm. Do
you, so you still have

531
00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:42.250
your desktop. You're not going
to accept this as your

532
00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:46.910
kind of primary top and
savior. Yeah. At work. I

533
00:26:46.910 --> 00:26:49.370
still have my desktop at
home. I just realized I

534
00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:51.980
was cleaning out some filing
over the weekend. My home

535
00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:54.410
desktop is five years old.
I built it five years

536
00:26:54.410 --> 00:26:57.920
ago and it's a core
I seven, nine 20, which

537
00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:01.250
was the original seven. And
so I'm debating right now

538
00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:04.970
whether I sink five, $600
on the internals of that

539
00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:07.580
to upgrade it to one
of the new devil's Canyon

540
00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:10.670
CPS, which were just released
for desktop, which would require

541
00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:14.060
a new motherboard and a
new video card and a

542
00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:16.220
new CPU, or whether I
just, you know what, let

543
00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:18.110
me just turn off the
desktop. And maybe I should

544
00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:22.010
just sync $200 on one
of the surface pro three

545
00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:25.220
docs and see if that
is a better setup for

546
00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:28.370
me at home. I, I'm
not really sure. You know,

547
00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:32.030
I have the same ultimate
developer PC that I built.

548
00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:33.890
I have to check online.
I think it would be

549
00:27:33.890 --> 00:27:36.500
about almost five years ago.
The one that Jeff Atwood

550
00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:40.610
helped me with and it's
fine. Like this is the

551
00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:43.700
thing about processor power and
why gigahertz just matters less.

552
00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:45.380
I think that when I
built this machine, it was

553
00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:48.560
about the last time that
I thought about gigahertz. Cause

554
00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:51.470
that was, I spent 15,
20 years always thinking about

555
00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:53.960
that. It's a core, I
seven it's an, it's an

556
00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:57.560
extreme edition. So it's the
extra nine 80 runs at

557
00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:01.850
3.33. I overclocked it just
a smidge. So it's a

558
00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:05.810
12 processor machine. They call
it a hexachord. It has

559
00:28:05.810 --> 00:28:10.580
12 gigs of Ram. And
it's fine, like really? But

560
00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:13.280
it was fine five years
ago. It's fine. Now the

561
00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:15.530
two upgrades that I made
to this machine were an

562
00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:18.950
SSD. If you're listening, you
have to get an SSD.

563
00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:22.100
It is just folly to
not have one. Okay. Amazon

564
00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:24.800
good. A new egg. You
can get a two 56

565
00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:27.860
gig name brand like a
Samsung, which is still considered

566
00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:30.470
one of the best ones
for under $200 now. Yep.

567
00:28:30.890 --> 00:28:33.320
So there, there is no
excuse if you, if you

568
00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:36.020
use a computer for a
living, please buy yourself an

569
00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:38.900
SSD, if your company won't.
Yeah. And then I found

570
00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:42.260
a Bitcoin miner online who
was getting rid of Nvidia

571
00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:45.230
cards and I bought an
Nvidia seven 50 I for

572
00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:48.800
a hundred bucks, which gave
me a significant, significant 3d

573
00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:50.600
upgrade. And I was suddenly
on now I can play

574
00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:54.620
10 80 P games like
tomb Raider at 60 frames

575
00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:57.590
a second. And the only
thing, like the only thing

576
00:28:57.590 --> 00:29:00.140
that keeps me up from
up at night is just

577
00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:03.680
one day the SSD will
die. That's basically like I'm

578
00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:06.020
four years into an SSD
and one day I'm going

579
00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:07.190
to turn this thing on
and it's just not going

580
00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:09.770
to turn out. Yeah. And
that will be stressful, but

581
00:29:09.770 --> 00:29:12.680
everything's backed up. Yeah. But
you know, basically the only

582
00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:16.100
thing that I worry about
is hard drive failure. Yeah.

583
00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:18.830
So the one thing that's
that, that is eating at

584
00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:20.450
me a bit with my
desktop at home now is

585
00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:23.240
just how much power it
uses. And I, and you're

586
00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:26.300
concerned about it from a
double. It it's it. Yeah.

587
00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:28.760
It's on most of the
time, it's probably one of

588
00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:32.330
the major power draws because
that, that I seven was

589
00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:35.420
rated at 140 Watts of
TDP. Like it puts out

590
00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:37.970
a lot of heat and
it consumes a lot of

591
00:29:37.970 --> 00:29:39.710
power. So it's, you know,
my, my office is a

592
00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:42.100
little noisy just because of
that one tower. It has

593
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:44.200
a very large cooler on
it. Whereas if I, if

594
00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:46.450
I dropped one of the
new devil Kenyans in, I

595
00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:50.740
can get, you know, a
lot more processing power, but

596
00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:53.260
they're rated at 88 Watts,
but then they run it

597
00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:56.350
four gigahertz. I mean, that's
an incredibly fast CPU. It's

598
00:29:56.350 --> 00:30:02.050
the fastest non lexical CPU
you can buy. And yet

599
00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:05.230
it uses substantially less power
and puts out a lot

600
00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:08.470
less heat than my current
setup. And I could even

601
00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:10.150
get rid of the video
card because it has integrated

602
00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:12.490
graphics and I don't play
PC games on my desktop

603
00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:15.820
at home. So I could
really reduce the amount of

604
00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:18.550
noise and Hayden power. That's
my office consumes at home

605
00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:20.740
while still having it turned
on all the time. So

606
00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:22.210
yeah, I dunno a bit
tone at the moment about

607
00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:24.690
what to do with my
desktop. Okay. So let's, let's

608
00:30:24.690 --> 00:30:26.850
in our, in our closing
here, as we've been rambling

609
00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:29.520
for a while, let's get
down to brass tacks. Can

610
00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:33.570
someone take their existing machine,
whatever their machine is and

611
00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:36.630
replace it. If they're a
full time professional developer with

612
00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:41.760
a surface pro three or
a similarly SPECT machine. So

613
00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:43.860
One thing that will stop
you, it's a yes and

614
00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:48.540
no. If you ordinarily use
virtual machines as part of

615
00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:51.420
your setup, then I would
probably say no, because eight

616
00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:54.390
gig of Ram is not
enough to run a host

617
00:30:54.390 --> 00:30:57.090
and a VM. It just
is not enough with any

618
00:30:57.150 --> 00:30:59.490
amount of performance with any
amount of performance. I couldn't

619
00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:01.470
do it on my carbon
touch and I can't do

620
00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:04.170
it on my surface pro
if you don't use VMs.

621
00:31:04.170 --> 00:31:05.790
And I don't, I don't
have any need to use

622
00:31:05.790 --> 00:31:09.000
VMs whatsoever. It is more
than enough. Okay. So I

623
00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.700
have a buddy of mine
who bought a surface pro

624
00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:14.400
three, and I warned him
about that. And he has

625
00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:18.180
been running VMs. He says
with some success, what he

626
00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:20.910
does is he runs a
them off of a separate

627
00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:23.130
hard drive. So he gets
a little more performance cause

628
00:31:23.130 --> 00:31:24.630
you've got a USB three
there. So he's got a

629
00:31:24.630 --> 00:31:28.770
USB three portable hard drive,
72 RPM. He runs the

630
00:31:28.770 --> 00:31:32.100
VM off of that. It,
he says that he makes

631
00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:34.200
the beam a little smaller
than you'd think because these

632
00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:37.230
are kind of single tasked
VMs. I see the idea

633
00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:38.850
being that some people say,
well, I have a four

634
00:31:38.850 --> 00:31:42.150
gig machine. I need a
four gig VM. Really what

635
00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:44.340
you need is a gig
and a half to run

636
00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:46.860
the one app or the,
you know, the one, if

637
00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:50.400
you're doing windows, I'm just
doing website development. You just

638
00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:52.890
need the IIS. So you
keep it a little smaller.

639
00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:55.890
But the real kicker, what
I thought you were going

640
00:31:55.890 --> 00:32:00.900
to say was that connected,
standby, that special I'm asleep,

641
00:32:00.930 --> 00:32:04.200
but not quite asleep. I
can still get email power

642
00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:06.480
mode is disabled when you
turn hyper V on. And

643
00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:08.880
everyone knows that everyone gets
all torn up about that.

644
00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:11.400
But remember that's a server
side feature that was ported

645
00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:14.070
to the client. So it
makes sense that the most

646
00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:17.880
advanced client side feature that
windows has is not supported

647
00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:21.540
by the most advanced service
side features. So, And let's

648
00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:24.450
remember that this is the
first core product available in

649
00:32:24.450 --> 00:32:28.080
the market that supports connected
standby. So what are you

650
00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:30.660
losing? I mean, my, my
carbon touched it and support

651
00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:34.290
connected standby. Right? Right. So
connect to standby, of course,

652
00:32:34.290 --> 00:32:37.050
as a way to snooze
and then also wake up,

653
00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:40.010
do something real quick and
then fall back asleep. It's

654
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:42.260
a, it also lets you
be on standby for a

655
00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:45.230
very, very long period of
time. What people are doing

656
00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:48.110
is just making a batch
file that calls BCD edit

657
00:32:48.290 --> 00:32:51.050
or, and, and basically turning
hyper V on and off,

658
00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:53.810
you can also make a
boot menu if you want

659
00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:55.880
to, to do the same
thing. So there's ways around

660
00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:58.370
it. But I agree with
you, if you live and

661
00:32:58.370 --> 00:33:00.890
breathe VMs, then the service
pro three is definitely not

662
00:33:00.890 --> 00:33:02.990
for you. Yeah. And I
certainly harp it in the

663
00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:06.050
future. The CPS do support
16 gigabyte, but there was

664
00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:09.350
no manufacturer building a laptop
with an Ultrabook CPU that

665
00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:12.380
takes 16 gigabyte that I'm
aware of. I would hope

666
00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:15.440
that someone allows that at
some point in the future.

667
00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:17.870
And this is where I
think you and I totally

668
00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:21.620
agreed. What is the ultimate
developer laptop look like? Yeah.

669
00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:25.010
I say that for me,
it's a surface pro three.

670
00:33:25.010 --> 00:33:27.320
It's what I have right
here. I could change anything.

671
00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:29.720
It would be to put
16 gigabytes in it and

672
00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:31.670
to have the next generation
of CPU so that it

673
00:33:31.670 --> 00:33:33.140
puts out just a little
bit less heat and I

674
00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:35.090
get a solid seven hours
of battery life out of

675
00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:37.250
it. That's the ultimate for
me. I would also say

676
00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:38.720
I very much. If you're
going to use it for

677
00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:42.440
your main machine, I'm thrilled
with the dock. I can

678
00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:46.850
run two large monitors, one
off of the mini DV

679
00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:48.980
on the back of it,
many DVI in the back

680
00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:51.560
of it. And one off
the side. So basically you

681
00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:56.210
can two monitors. You can
chain using a display link

682
00:33:56.240 --> 00:34:01.790
chaining. You get like fricking
six different USB on the

683
00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:04.100
dock, on the dock. It's
a ridiculous amount of USB,

684
00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:07.700
much more than most docs.
It's really quite elegant. If

685
00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:11.240
my desktop died tomorrow, while
I would mourn it, I

686
00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:13.370
would probably not rush out
and replace it because I

687
00:34:13.370 --> 00:34:16.280
would probably just switch everything
to use the surface. So

688
00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:20.360
I'm pretty happy with that.
If you have an SSD

689
00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:23.300
and you've got eight gigs
or maybe 12, I think

690
00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:25.550
you could succeed, but I'm
pretty happy with it and

691
00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:28.430
I'm going to keep, keep
using it. Cool. Thanks for

692
00:34:28.430 --> 00:34:31.130
chatting with me, buddy. No,
not at all. This has

693
00:34:31.130 --> 00:34:33.980
been another episode of Hanselminutes
and we'll see you again

694
00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:41.810
next week. <inaudible>.
