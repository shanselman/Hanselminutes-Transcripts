our weekly discussion with web

9
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.850
developer and technologist Scott Hanselman.
This is Lawrence Ryan announcing show

10
00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.500
number four 43. In this
episode, Scott talks with IIE

11
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:08.640
about the sass CSS preprocessor.
Hi, this is Scott Hanselman.

12
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.440
This is another episode of
Hansel minutes, and I'm here

13
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.460
at Len comp in North Carolina,
and I'm talking with Claudina

14
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.850
<inaudible> and I get that
right. Thank you so much.

15
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.320
And you gave a workshop
at this conference on SAS

16
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.820
for hours. You talked about
sex Three. You can give

17
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.450
me that extra credit. Okay.
Absolutely. That extra freedom. You

18
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.680
could even probably spend a
week talking about it. I

19
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.390
could, yeah, I could. I
could spend a week. It's

20
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.790
been a day, at least
for the workshop. You definitely

21
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.800
need a lot of time.
It's too much too much

22
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.740
to get into. Yeah, it
seems like there. And I

23
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.690
think that people who are
programmers like to say that

24
00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.000
there's two kinds of people
in the world, in whatever

25
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.820
situation, I feel like there's
people who write CSS and

26
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.460
there's people who really architected
that people craft it and

27
00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.450
who care about it. Why
is there that dichotomy between

28
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.310
the people that you just
bang out, sip cm, CSS

29
00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:00.260
versus people who make well
modularized, thoughtful, large scale CSS?

30
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.950
Well, I think we're actually
at the time where we

31
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.830
can actually architect CSS and
this is what preprocessor is,

32
00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.260
have allowed us to do.
And prior to that, it

33
00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:14.390
was difficult. It wasn't impossible.
And Nicole Sullivan came out with,

34
00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.510
Oh, CSS as a convention
for starting to do this

35
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.970
with, with what we had,
which was class names in

36
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.190
a CSS file, but CSS
is a very flat language.

37
00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.250
So what can you do
with that? You know, like

38
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.770
you need more dynamic tools.
So these P processors have

39
00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.980
really opened the door for
it, but we're dealing with

40
00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.300
this sort of baggage of
development where we weren't really

41
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.900
thinking like architects or weren't
really designing our systems. So

42
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.060
that's the new hurdle to
get around on top of

43
00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.030
now having to learn this
new language. So those are

44
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.700
the challenges When I've created
CSS and I'm not a

45
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.260
designer, but I can, you
know, I can hack my

46
00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.980
way around a decent site
and I've done CSS on

47
00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.770
all of my, my sites.
They I've either done it.

48
00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.580
Two ways started from a
page or like a reset

49
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.490
CSS and then gone from
there and done my best

50
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:04.990
to build something. And then
I got it to a

51
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.450
point where it was nice
and then a week or

52
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.340
two goes by and I
need to make a change.

53
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.620
And inevitably that changed and
sticking out the bottom. And

54
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.920
then it's a line at
the bottom. So fast forward

55
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.080
four years, I think there's
more at the bottom than

56
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.960
there ever was before, but
I'm afraid to touch it

57
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.470
the bottom of your, you
know, like the entire file.

58
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.500
I'm just like, it works
right. It cascades. And, you

59
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.420
know, I could rearrange the
thing and it might just

60
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.660
stop working because something might
override something else and you're

61
00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.280
just going to leave it
be, and it's all in

62
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.210
like, you know, site dot
CSS, save me. What did

63
00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:45.030
I do? Where did I
go wrong? Well, I read

64
00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.910
What I'm saying is that,
do I start with like

65
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.770
a master dot CSS? And
then just get to a

66
00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.300
point where I like, I
need to start breaking this

67
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.110
up into pieces, The process
for sort of coming into

68
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.650
antecessor rearchitect rearchitecting a file.
Yeah. I think like if

69
00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.050
I'm starting in a Greenfield
development or I'm writing it

70
00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.630
from scratch, right? Cause most
CSS people have, I have

71
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.730
talked to say that if
it gets into a rat's

72
00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.400
nest, just really don't try
to rearchitect it, know how

73
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.800
to refactor it. Just think,
think of it as a

74
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.680
reference, get rid of it
and start from scratch and

75
00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.600
then write it and you'll
find it it'll be smaller.

76
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.360
It's almost like if you
lose a term paper, you

77
00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.430
can mourn the paper. You
can try to recover the

78
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.200
paper. But frankly, if you
just write it again, the

79
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.420
second time it's going to
be better. Yeah. You know,

80
00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.250
I actually have had a
lot of discussions with sort

81
00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.010
of this idea of refactoring
with the Gina Bolton and

82
00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.740
Elise holiday. And, and the
truth is that not everyone

83
00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.210
can throw away their giant
crazy sites dot CSS files.

84
00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.450
We had a woman yesterday
in the workshop who was

85
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:40.920
like, this is great. You
know, we have this giant

86
00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.920
file and I have to
figure out how to like

87
00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.920
port our CSS to SAS.
And so one of the

88
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.630
things I started out with,
which I think is really

89
00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.670
important and this sort of,
one of the areas where

90
00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:54.120
we can get the most
gain is how you organize

91
00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.850
your file directory with SAS,
because it is new. We

92
00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.150
no longer have this monolithic
site dot CSS or screen

93
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.910
or Maine. We now have
these tiny little partials where

94
00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.400
we can put things into,
but again, what do you

95
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.550
put into it and what
goes in there? So I

96
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.120
spent some time definitely talking
about that. And I think,

97
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.820
I mean, my approach when
you're dealing with refactoring would

98
00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:20.790
be follow this sort of
organization, which I modified from

99
00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.790
Dale, Sandy, who's done a
really good job thinking about

100
00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:26.520
ways to what he calls,
avoid your SAS junk drawer.

101
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.820
And then through my work
at odd bird and our

102
00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:34.140
little experiments, we've modified this
and Is this something we

103
00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.780
can get to? Is this
on get hub? Yeah, it's

104
00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:41.730
in my, do you have
links to it? Awesome. Awesome.

105
00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:43.530
I will give you a
link, a link to it,

106
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.810
but yeah, I would start
out by really like the

107
00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:51.150
thing about SAS is you
have this, this directory, which

108
00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.670
is like your base, which
is finally sort of setting

109
00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.400
up your variables and the
things that you need, like

110
00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.280
setting up your tools that
you need to build all

111
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:04.460
your other components. And so
a refactoring adventure for me

112
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.400
might be looking at that
monolithic CSS thing and being

113
00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.690
like, okay, these are sort
of grouped together. And these

114
00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:15.680
form, like my author section,
and then I would yank

115
00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.340
that out into its own
partial and keep doing that

116
00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.500
until I've got sort of
an idea of what the

117
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.890
separate components are. And then
from there you can continue

118
00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:27.320
down your refactoring adventure to
make it more and more

119
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:30.520
sassy. So, okay. So then
I could take, like, these

120
00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.920
are all colors that are
associated with this brand and

121
00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.230
then those would be like
a colors. Yup. And then

122
00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:38.740
I would move that into
like colors dot config file.

123
00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:40.510
And I would say these
are all my colors and

124
00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:43.210
they're here and these are
all my font stuff in

125
00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:46.870
there here. And we have,
we do some stuff with

126
00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.360
sizing to try to keep
those pretty consistent so that

127
00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.910
you're not Okay. So that's
interesting. So you're saying like

128
00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:53.440
the size of like a
button and you want it

129
00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.560
to be the same everywhere.
Yeah. We actually have little

130
00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.140
helpers for sizing that we
use for like even margin

131
00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:01.870
or padding. And they're very
simple. We have three names.

132
00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:04.060
Shim is the tiniest and
then we have gutter and

133
00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.610
column and it's just, you
start to think that way

134
00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:08.620
you're like, then this space
I want small and in

135
00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:10.870
this one I want a
little larger. Okay. So you're

136
00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:14.260
saying to keep, I can
understand like the obvious stuff,

137
00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:17.740
like, okay. You know, consolidate
my colors, but consolidating my,

138
00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:23.050
my white space almost into
its own a partial <inaudible>

139
00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:27.610
okay. Sizing tool. Yeah. Sizing
tool. Let's let me back

140
00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:28.750
up a little bit for
some of the people who

141
00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:32.230
are more kind of SAS
one-on-one type people. It's a

142
00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:36.010
it's, it's a preprocessor. So
it effectively elevate CSS to

143
00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:39.940
a, kind of a full
programming language that compiles into

144
00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:43.720
a target, which where that
target is CSS and as

145
00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:46.570
such, I can plug different
things into it. Yeah. It

146
00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:49.270
actually, I think one of
the coolest things that's happened

147
00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:52.090
with the recent advance in
SaaS is we have SAS

148
00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:55.720
maps and maps are a
hash or array, very common

149
00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:58.690
to any other programming language.
Some brilliant people in SaaS

150
00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:01.330
have written extensions that allow
you to actually take your

151
00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:04.810
sass map and convert it
to Jason, which is crazy,

152
00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:08.110
which now means that you
can convert CSS to Jason,

153
00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.890
which is an interchangeable data
format that allows you to

154
00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:14.590
now communicate with any language.
And I'm not sure how

155
00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:17.590
I'm supposed to feel about
that. That's pretty, mind-bending, It's

156
00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.860
pretty awesome. It's really great
for style guides, actually, this

157
00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:24.940
for making maintainable style guides
in the sense that one

158
00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:26.950
of the things that front
end people bemoan is like,

159
00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:28.540
Oh, I've added a new
color. And now I have

160
00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:30.460
to go to my style
guide and like copy and

161
00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:33.670
paste this thing. And I'm
like, Nope, I just add

162
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:36.190
a new color to my
map. It exports to Jason.

163
00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:38.080
And then in my template,
I loop through my Jace

164
00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:42.070
on file. I see. Okay.
So all of the, all

165
00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:44.650
of the sizes and the
colors become data, they're just

166
00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:48.850
data trapped in SAS. You
compile that to Jason and

167
00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:52.090
then just like any other
template you bought it. I

168
00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:54.280
use a lot of that.
Mostly for like style guides

169
00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:57.740
stuff. That's really the only
Thing like documentation effect. Yeah.

170
00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:59.990
Yeah. But I think to
me, that's one of the

171
00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:03.920
most powerful things when you're
like, wow, this gets to

172
00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:06.800
talk to any language. Now,
when did we have that

173
00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.920
with CSS? We never had
that. So that's a whole

174
00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:11.630
new Well, and it makes
you us as kind of

175
00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:14.180
addressable, like, you know, HTML
is addressable. I can access

176
00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:16.280
the Dom. JavaScript is the
thing that we address it

177
00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:18.500
with. And then CSS was
kind of like bolted onto

178
00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:20.060
the side. It was just
this thing that was along

179
00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.160
for the ride. And we
couldn't. But the thing that

180
00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.560
makes beauty on the web,
it's like a very important

181
00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.840
language. It's the reason that
things look nice and that

182
00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:29.120
we can actually use things.
I mean, it's not just,

183
00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:32.420
and it's terrible and flat
on its own, but not

184
00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:35.900
anymore. And when I talked
to one of the people

185
00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:38.150
who worked on SAS kind
of early on, what was

186
00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:41.270
the gentleman's name? Hampton, Hampton,
he was saying that he

187
00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:43.490
didn't understand why it wasn't
such an obvious thing for

188
00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:46.490
the CSS people to just
do like, just add some

189
00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:49.790
hierarchy and that's a good
start. Like why did we

190
00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:52.550
not do that? Why was
CSS so flat? And the

191
00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:56.090
problem that, that caused, I
don't know enough about the

192
00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:59.300
history of CSS too. I
guess it's more of a,

193
00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:02.720
it SAS happened because there
was an idea of vacuum.

194
00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.550
There was something that was
like, there was a pain.

195
00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.680
Yeah. But it actually took
a really long time for

196
00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:09.560
it to get adopted. It
took like seven years before

197
00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:12.020
this thing is now really?
Yeah. It was just floating

198
00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:14.210
out there that many years
ago. It took a while.

199
00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:17.540
It really took a while
before people were into it.

200
00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:21.740
And there's actually, I mean,
so called the, like, like

201
00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:23.540
some of the bigger names
in front end for a

202
00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:25.340
while were just like, I
don't know why you would

203
00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:27.770
even want to use this
thing called a preprocessor and

204
00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:29.720
this is bad and it's,
and you can't do it.

205
00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:32.650
And it's just like, well,
what actually I think forced

206
00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:36.080
people around it was this
whole, these device constraints. And

207
00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:39.620
it became impossible to deal
with so many devices with

208
00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:44.750
a flat language. There's just,
I mean, we were designers,

209
00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:47.420
which at our heart means
that we're architects and we're

210
00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:49.460
looking for patterns and we're
pulling these things together and

211
00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:53.550
trying to figure out how
these systems work. And we,

212
00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:56.630
we need languages that let
us do that. And so

213
00:10:56.630 --> 00:11:00.200
I think people finally realized
and came to, Seems like

214
00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.080
there was a sense of
not wanting to repeat ourselves,

215
00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:06.110
right. This idea of being
dry. And it reached a

216
00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:08.750
pain where it's like, okay,
fine. This is just ridiculous.

217
00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:11.690
I have repeated myself with
this color or these margins.

218
00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:15.200
So many times now we
need variables. Where is that

219
00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:17.990
tool? <inaudible> yeah. The variables
are definitely sort of the

220
00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:20.030
first thing that would sell
everyone. He'd be like, look,

221
00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:22.100
he no longer have to
write this color over and

222
00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:25.520
over and over again. I'm
just the gateway drug though.

223
00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:30.320
Absolutely. Absolutely. Ooh. Red, look
at it, go one variable.

224
00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:34.070
Well, what are, what are
mixings Makes sense are ways

225
00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:38.270
of sharing like blocks of
code, but the difference is

226
00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:42.170
that they take arguments. So
you can manipulate like the

227
00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:46.820
data. So you can create
this reusable property block. But

228
00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:50.420
let's say for example, yesterday,
my workshop, I use the

229
00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:54.520
notifications as an example where
you have the general structure

230
00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:56.800
of a notification that can
be shared, but then you

231
00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.990
might have three different types
of a notification. You might

232
00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:01.630
have like a pop up,
like an alert, a warning,

233
00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:05.230
and you might different colors.
So we can create a

234
00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:09.130
mixing to share sort of
the color styles and manipulations.

235
00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:12.550
And we pass in one
argument which would be color,

236
00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:15.280
and then it can generate
all the rest of the,

237
00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:17.970
See that just clicked in
my head. That is a

238
00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:21.300
really great analogy because you're
going to want the buttons

239
00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:22.410
to be the same. You're
going to want the thing

240
00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:24.000
to lay out the same.
Maybe you'll have a box

241
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.070
shadow. It's going to be
spaced. It's going to be

242
00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:30.390
90% the same for these
different classes of, of error

243
00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:33.960
messages, but you want the
flexibility to change something fundamentally.

244
00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:36.600
So this one is pretty
neat in the sense that

245
00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:39.030
you pass one color, which
is the background color. And

246
00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:42.240
then because SaaS has crazy
color functions, I can use

247
00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.670
SAS color functions to take
a one color and then

248
00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:49.560
derive a text color, and
a border color and a

249
00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:52.080
nice drop shadow color. And
I can even be smart

250
00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:56.280
enough to say, okay, SAS,
if my background is dark,

251
00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:59.400
I want you to manipulate
this color. So we make

252
00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:02.280
a lighter text color. If
I have a light background

253
00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:04.350
color, I know I need
to do a different manipulation

254
00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:06.210
because my text color needs
to be dark. Like he

255
00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:08.850
could not do that with
you. Interesting. Okay. So let's,

256
00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:10.860
let's dig into that for
a little bit. So in

257
00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:13.650
the past, it's mostly go
to Photoshop, use the little

258
00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:17.520
I call it the legend
of Zelda sword, because it

259
00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:19.170
looks like the eye drop
pick that looks like a

260
00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:21.180
little Mister you're going into,
and then you basically just

261
00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:25.140
start memorizing the hex hoppy
pasting it, right. So much.

262
00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:27.390
I actually have an open
Photoshop in such a long

263
00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:30.630
time. My life is better.
That's good. So you're saying

264
00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:33.420
that I can just say
my base is sky blue

265
00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:37.050
and then say, you know,
two Hughes steps down or

266
00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.690
two saturations in this direction.
Yeah. You can actually work

267
00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:43.170
with HSL, which is really
great. So as a designer,

268
00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:45.450
it's it thinks the way
a designer thinks cause you,

269
00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:48.560
I assume you guys think
in terms of, you said

270
00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:53.660
HSL, can you explain what
he does? Saturation lightness, just

271
00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:56.310
preface that I'm not a
designer, but HSL makes sense

272
00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:59.400
to me in my brain
because it's easier to work

273
00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:02.550
with. So the idea is
that Hugh is a zero

274
00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:04.950
to three 60, so color
exists on a color wheel.

275
00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:07.350
So red is zero and
three 60, and then you're

276
00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:10.980
moving around from there. Purple
I think is maybe like

277
00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:13.230
200 ish. So you start
to memorize where things go,

278
00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:16.650
saturation is how much gray,
you're adding to something more

279
00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:18.750
or less gray. And then
lightness is how light or

280
00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:21.870
dark that color is. So
you can really easily create

281
00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:26.150
these manipulations. And for someone
like for me, especially, I'm

282
00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.960
like, well, this makes, this
makes sense. I can critique

283
00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:30.630
one color and do some
light little modifications and create

284
00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:34.500
an actually like pretty decent
looking design. Well, and it's

285
00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:36.180
a much more, it seems
to me that he's a

286
00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:39.420
much more disciplined and much
more focused way to solve

287
00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:41.640
a problem in the sense
of I as a non

288
00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:44.550
designer. And in, in this
interaction, I'm going to call

289
00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:47.010
you, even though you're not
a designer, you're a hell

290
00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:48.210
of a lot more of
a designer than I am.

291
00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:50.370
I'm gonna look at a
blue and I'm going to

292
00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:53.240
that blue next to it
kind of looks okay and

293
00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:55.460
I'm going to eyeball it.
But someone else is going

294
00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:58.070
to say, this is our
base blue. This is our

295
00:14:58.070 --> 00:15:02.240
base green. I want 20%
more saturation. Yep. It doesn't

296
00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:04.250
really, I don't really care
what the resulting hex value

297
00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:06.230
is. I just know that
I want to be very

298
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:09.560
focused about it and add
that to my style guide.

299
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:11.240
And then I'm going to
get consistent. And I assume

300
00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.820
I could get my site.
Could I get my sass

301
00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:16.580
down to like a very
small number of base colors

302
00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:21.190
and calculate everything else I
actually try to strive for

303
00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:25.540
that is really just reducing
sort of the number of

304
00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:28.540
variables that you have and
then using these functions for

305
00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:31.030
manipulation to create the other
things that you need. So

306
00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:34.840
you're not creating like before
I think people would do

307
00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:37.300
like a background color, then
a text color and a

308
00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:41.080
dropdown text, shadow color, and
a border color. And that's

309
00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:45.730
fine, but that's still very,
I mean, that's also not

310
00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:49.210
very dry. So even though
I think it's one of

311
00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:51.130
the things I also stress
when I'm teaching is like

312
00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:55.870
SAS still compiles down to
CSS. So we do need

313
00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:57.520
to be aware of that.
And then there are ways

314
00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:00.160
within our SAS code when
we're architecting it, that we

315
00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:04.210
can also be dry, more
dry and less wet. And

316
00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:06.820
so I think colors is
a great example where you

317
00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:09.820
can try to derive the
rest of it from one

318
00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:13.060
that's much better than setting
like a giant colors variable

319
00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:16.930
file. Could I write my
SAS poorly that I might

320
00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:20.060
end up with CSS? That
is way more complicated than

321
00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:21.920
like, do I, is it
one of those things? I

322
00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:24.370
just ignore that there's this
generated file and pretend it

323
00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:27.430
doesn't exist. You should always
be looking at your, at

324
00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:31.780
your generated file, always, especially
when you're learning. Cause it's,

325
00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:33.670
it's also important to see
that's how you begin to

326
00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:36.160
understand like exactly what it's
doing. Cause most people are

327
00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:39.460
like, it's magic. It's like,
no, it's still compiles down

328
00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:41.890
to something that browser understands.
So you need to make

329
00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:45.790
sure that that's okay. So
I think it's the best

330
00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:48.880
way to always keep them
safe. So if something's wrong,

331
00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:50.740
do I, is it to
me that I'm doing SAS

332
00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:52.930
wrong or do I need
to give it hints? Or

333
00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:55.060
there are ways to say
sort of in what sense,

334
00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:56.620
like, I don't know, let's
say that I do something

335
00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:58.300
in the end, it kind
of explodes into this kind

336
00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:01.450
of Cartesian product of colors.
And it's like, wow, this

337
00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:05.200
is way more information than
that, that selector needed. Like

338
00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:09.430
this, this property block is
more expressive because I had

339
00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:10.870
a mixed in with a
mix center, whatever. And it

340
00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:15.010
just kind of like, you
know what I mean? Can

341
00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:17.980
I do anything with the
generated file or is it

342
00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:19.840
all has to flow from
SAS to system? It has

343
00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:22.540
to flow from South to
CSS. Yeah. The generated file

344
00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:25.480
is more like, Oh, Whoa,
whoops. I might be nesting

345
00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:28.540
this thing and correctly, or
I may have extended a

346
00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:33.340
property without realizing that it's
within another. And it just

347
00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:36.940
created a nightmare. I understand
that. Is it true that

348
00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:41.260
I can write some JavaScript
and evaluate JavaScript evaluations within

349
00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.690
SAS and then that can
expand out. I can basically

350
00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:47.350
have JavaScript expressions like gifts
and stuff Like the control

351
00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:50.700
directions, like if each in
mice. So what would I

352
00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:55.280
use that for Control directives?
Well, for example, when I,

353
00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:57.170
when we were talking about
color and being able to

354
00:17:57.170 --> 00:17:59.360
test, you're going to use,
that's a control directive right

355
00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:02.990
there. So yeah, if you're
basically saying, if the lightness

356
00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:07.130
of this color is greater
than 50%, then perform this

357
00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:10.430
action, I'll do something else.
So you, you can use

358
00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:14.030
if an L statements are
really, really powerful. I see.

359
00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:16.250
So if, if a color
got to light, I could,

360
00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:18.500
you know, I could block
it from getting any lighter

361
00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:21.290
or I could, Or you
can even tell, like it's

362
00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:23.480
a great way for designing
mix sense for being like,

363
00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:26.060
well, if I've defined this
argument or have set this,

364
00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:27.980
then I need you to
print out these other CSS

365
00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:33.320
properties. Otherwise don't, we don't
actually need them. So it's

366
00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:37.880
very, they're really, really, really
powerful. And each is the

367
00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:40.580
other one that I think
is really well, like used

368
00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:43.880
a lot. And especially with
maps and especially used to

369
00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:47.540
generate like actually generate CSS
for you, which is incredible.

370
00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:50.090
One of the things that
I think is worth pointing

371
00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:52.760
out and I think the
listeners will agree is that

372
00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:56.060
for a lot of us
who work on large systems

373
00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:58.520
inside of enterprises and we
haven't built kind of a

374
00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:01.430
modern, I'm saying that in
air quotes, a modern app,

375
00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:05.240
a modular app with a
client side build process in

376
00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:07.820
a while we have some
JavaScript, we put in a

377
00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:09.830
file and then we ship
that JavaScript. We have some

378
00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:11.360
CSS, we put in a
file on the ship that,

379
00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:14.120
but the new way of
doing things is not just

380
00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:16.760
a service side build for
applications that compile on the

381
00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:22.050
server, but also a client
side build process. This, you,

382
00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:27.200
it sounds like you could
have really sophisticated, complex CSS

383
00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:30.170
that is truly architected. That
can be managed by many,

384
00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:32.120
many people. And they're going
to, you're going to have

385
00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:35.030
not just one designer working
on one file, but a

386
00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:39.610
whole team sharing these different
visual languages, sharing these mix

387
00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:43.520
ENS, and that's all part
of a build process. And

388
00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:45.740
is that the kind of
the, do you find yourself

389
00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:48.410
working on those projects or
these are the CSS is

390
00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:51.350
that you can, that one
person can understand. Cause I

391
00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:53.420
feel like it's getting complicated
enough that I'm going to

392
00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:55.070
not be able to fit
it all in my, in

393
00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:59.300
my head on one project,
Do I find myself working

394
00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:02.930
on teams Where I wasn't,
I'm trying to say that

395
00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:05.780
suddenly I went from being
one file to being a

396
00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:08.630
whole series of functions that
I've got colors and it

397
00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:11.390
got mixed since I've got
libraries and I just didn't

398
00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:15.380
expect CSS to go in
that direction. And is this

399
00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:17.090
something that works better when
I have teams? Like if

400
00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:19.310
you have, if you're working
with three other people who

401
00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:23.420
are managing your front end
CSS work, do you each

402
00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:25.250
work in the same file?
Do you use, do you

403
00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:27.260
break it up so that
you can be working in

404
00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:29.930
separate parts of the SAS?
And can you get into

405
00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:32.300
situations where someone makes a
change and then it breaks

406
00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:35.540
the entire style sheet because
they made one variable change.

407
00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:39.950
It's so dry now cascades
more than ever. The good

408
00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:41.810
thing is that if it's
a change that the compiler

409
00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:45.050
doesn't like, it won't actually
let it happen, which is

410
00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:49.710
nice. You can't like compile
things because, Because it's basically

411
00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:51.960
linting it, you know, it
is compiled. And if it's

412
00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:54.240
not The valid, yeah, it
has to be valid for

413
00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:59.880
CSS in terms of working
with teams, I work with,

414
00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:02.280
there's only one other front
end developer on my team.

415
00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:05.670
So it makes it a
lot easier. And we have

416
00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:09.000
a very, very big focus
about building tools. And so

417
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.490
we're very, very aware of
like, Oh, okay, we are

418
00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:14.670
reusing this snippet of code
or this idea a lot.

419
00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:17.190
How can we make something
better? So we have a

420
00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:22.470
big focus on making better
tools internally. I definitely think

421
00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:26.250
of course, there's going to
be more complexity when you're

422
00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:30.480
dealing with multiple people on
a team and the added

423
00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:33.480
complexities of just am I
putting my code in the

424
00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:36.420
right partial, which partial should
this go into? Where should

425
00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:38.430
it go? You know, like
what's going to happen. And

426
00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:41.280
I think all of that,
again comes down to the

427
00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:45.120
beginning and the setup and
like, how are you designing

428
00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:48.450
and architecting your project? And
we don't, I just feel

429
00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:51.690
that we like, at least
in front end, we don't

430
00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:54.240
really, we don't have the
mindset. We haven't wrapped our

431
00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:58.560
head around this completely. Like
we are architects, this is

432
00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:01.440
not okay. The designers now
given us the PSD and

433
00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:03.630
we should just like, go
start, like taking it apart.

434
00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:05.100
You need to sit down
and look at it and

435
00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:07.530
be like, okay, what are
these actual components? What things

436
00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:10.260
do we have here? And
if you really sort of

437
00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:13.710
forward thinking, you're going to
start to build your own

438
00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:16.410
little framework and sort of
pattern library so that you

439
00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:20.280
can get through things faster
and help you out and

440
00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:23.610
conventions that work for you
and your team. And so

441
00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:25.200
I think that can be
the hard thing, especially cause

442
00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.270
it's so new now that
everyone's like, well, what's the

443
00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:29.190
best way. What's the best
thing. And it's like, you

444
00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:30.690
know what? The best way
for me is not the

445
00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:33.360
best way for you because
my team and my requirements

446
00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:36.390
are different and you need
to analyze it from what

447
00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:39.450
are your goals and your
objectives and what do you

448
00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:42.690
have at your disposal. So
You're expressed that so much

449
00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:45.830
better. I apologize for my
muddled question. I think what

450
00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:48.090
you, you express it so
much better than I did.

451
00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:49.560
I think what I was
trying to get my head

452
00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:53.520
around was this idea that
the intentionality of it suddenly

453
00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:56.040
changed. And like you just
expressed it so well. And

454
00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:58.170
you said that your team,
your team member, and you

455
00:22:58.950 --> 00:23:02.490
are making a set of
tools and those tools are

456
00:23:02.490 --> 00:23:04.590
these property blocks. And these
makes sense. And these colors

457
00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:07.890
and these colors and these
color functions, where, what is

458
00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:10.620
it exactly we're trying to
accomplish? How are we going

459
00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:13.950
to architect that solution to
solve this problem for the

460
00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:16.590
business? And we're going to
build a reusable set of

461
00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:19.620
tools and we, you and
that other designer, or if

462
00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:21.750
you had more designers are
all on the same team.

463
00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:24.450
And these are the things
we value. It's that intentionality.

464
00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:29.130
Yeah. The communication and talking
and all these. I mean,

465
00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:32.040
those, those things are hard
already on their own. And

466
00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:34.950
then when you add this
new language that can create

467
00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:36.870
more complexities where you're like,
well, I stuck it in

468
00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:39.180
that partial and I put
it there and I imported

469
00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:41.160
it there. And it's like,
ah, you know, you gotta

470
00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:44.640
have some sort of rules
around it. And I think

471
00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:47.450
that at least if you're
on a team, if you're

472
00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:49.580
just like, what's going on
with my CSS, why is

473
00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:51.410
this a disorder? And then
maybe you should look at

474
00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:55.180
like, how are we interacting
as a team? And, and

475
00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:58.660
that, that speaks to the,
if it, to call back

476
00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:00.640
to the beginning of the
conversation, if they just like,

477
00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:04.270
stick it at the bottom,
exactly. You're going to smack

478
00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:05.620
them down and you're going
to be like, okay, come

479
00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:07.720
on. I can still easily
happen. Someone will just be

480
00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:09.340
like, Oh yeah, I put
it in a partial. Then

481
00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:11.320
I imported the partial at
the bottom and it's just

482
00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:12.970
like, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no. Even

483
00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:16.270
the import file has an
order to it. Read it.

484
00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:19.810
And this isn't just being
like uptight. Like some people

485
00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:21.640
might be listening and going,
Oh, you know, they're just

486
00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:24.730
rearranging deck chairs on the
Titanic. It's all going to

487
00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:29.920
be chaos anyway. But a
really well architected SAS system

488
00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:33.850
is a thing of beauty.
Oh yeah. It's, it's amazing.

489
00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:36.100
Right. It's just, it's like
a great building. It's like

490
00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:38.530
when you walk in and
you're like, everything is, is

491
00:24:38.530 --> 00:24:42.130
right. You know, this it's
all in this place when

492
00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:45.370
I was in school. I
mean, I always thought I

493
00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:47.620
wanted to study architecture and
I never did. I ended

494
00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:49.540
up dropping out of school,
taking a year off. And

495
00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:51.130
then I was like, Oh,
this web thing is really

496
00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:53.200
fun. I should move to
Portland, Oregon. When I took

497
00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:56.520
a year off, that's where
I went. That's where I

498
00:24:56.520 --> 00:25:00.880
got started. And so it's
my, I had this theory

499
00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:03.670
in scores like, well, you
can take poetry, which is

500
00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:05.920
a, like a system in
of itself and you can

501
00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:07.690
design for it. So then
when you go somewhere, you

502
00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:09.610
can elicit a certain type
of design. So I think

503
00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:13.050
that's the beauty of a
well architected file is that

504
00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:17.530
like, you've, you're showing your
ability to like think through

505
00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:20.080
these requirements and not only
have you translated it into

506
00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:23.740
like the final website, which
like for users to interact,

507
00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:26.260
like we as developers, we
interact with our files and

508
00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:28.870
we should take care of
them too. So It's a

509
00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:30.850
garden that needs to be
tended. And if a weed

510
00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:33.700
pops up at the bottom
of the file and got

511
00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:35.860
pulled that week Yeah. Cause
too many weeds. And you're

512
00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:38.140
like, I don't care about
this garden. Anyhow. You know,

513
00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:40.900
you just want that away.
So at the beginning you

514
00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:43.690
mentioned that you did a,
a three hour workshop, but

515
00:25:43.690 --> 00:25:46.720
it could have been a
week long. You're actually, you're

516
00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:48.880
actually at a conference organizer,
you have a conference. What

517
00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:55.180
is your conference? SAS <inaudible>
so Tire conference about SAS,

518
00:25:56.290 --> 00:25:58.600
which, which I think the
point of reason I'm saying

519
00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:01.300
it like that with that
kind of gravitas is that

520
00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:05.800
it's so powerful and it's
so significant. And the idea

521
00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:08.650
of a large system that
is architected well, that is

522
00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:12.160
then agile enough to respond,
to changes in the design

523
00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:15.460
needs, books and conferences and
tools like this. So tell

524
00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:17.260
me about your conference. How
long is it? What kinds

525
00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:20.980
of people should go to,
to Saskatoon? Well, if you're

526
00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:25.120
a thought SAS enthusiast definitely,
definitely come, but we don't

527
00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:28.030
come to, I mean, we
bill it as a conference

528
00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:30.640
for people that want to
make a better web and

529
00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:33.130
not only for users, but
like for ourselves as developers.

530
00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:37.090
So also caring about that
developer experience and SAS comp

531
00:26:37.090 --> 00:26:39.190
this year is going to
be October 2nd through fourth in

532
00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:41.950
New York city again, and this
year it's three days. So

533
00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:44.400
we have a full single
track conference day to have

534
00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:47.370
Atkins as our keynote, which
I'm super excited about. And

535
00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:51.200
then we have tab Atkins
is the spec hacker over

536
00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:54.180
at Google. So he, he
does a lot with the

537
00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:58.620
CSS spec, which is really
neat. And when you think

538
00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:00.870
about, I think the other
power of sass is how

539
00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:04.650
it's influencing decisions that are
coming out and CSS. And,

540
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.700
but again, this sort of
idea of I'm like, well,

541
00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:12.630
if Sasin converted Jaison then
who knows, maybe the browser

542
00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:16.670
one day will just decide
to understand something else. It

543
00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:19.970
does make one wonder that
we see things like coffee

544
00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:23.870
script or TypeScript influencing the
future of JavaScript. Is there

545
00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:26.120
a convergence coming where it's
going to be here are

546
00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:28.880
the angle brackets and here
are the curly braces. And

547
00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:32.210
the curly braces are both
CSS and JavaScript chat, you

548
00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:35.600
know, CSS with inline JavaScript
or JavaScript within ICSs, who

549
00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:38.360
knows we'll find out its
task conference. We will find

550
00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:40.970
out what, what tab has
to say. And then our

551
00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:43.490
second day is workshops. You
can pick between two, four

552
00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:46.280
hour workshops. And our third
day, this year is our

553
00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:50.270
community unconference day, which I'm
super, super excited about. And

554
00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:53.060
last year was just like
last year was the first

555
00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:56.450
time that everyone in this
community came together. And it

556
00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:59.120
was, I mean, it was
powerful to see Chris and

557
00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:03.350
Hampton and Natalie and people
who have been organizing for

558
00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:05.720
years. And for the first
time they'd seen you, they

559
00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:07.850
hadn't seen each other for
years. And here we all

560
00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:11.510
were like, yeah. And here
we were like together coming

561
00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:13.760
together for the first time,
seeing like how we really

562
00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:15.530
love this thing. And we
want to hang out as

563
00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:17.270
a community and we want
to make it better. And,

564
00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:20.840
and a lot's happened since
then within the SAS community.

565
00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:23.450
And it's just, I mean,
it's a, it's a wonderful

566
00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:26.450
place. I'm so, so happy
to be there Speaking just

567
00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:29.360
a little bit about kind
of quote unquote, the competition.

568
00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:33.590
There are, there are other
preprocessing process, right? There was,

569
00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:36.530
there was less kind of
for awhile that this fallen

570
00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:38.900
out of favor. Is that
fair to say? I mean,

571
00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:43.040
unless it's still there, unless
Twitter bootstrap hadn't started with

572
00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:47.660
Las, I don't think it
would be as prominent. And

573
00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:49.910
I actually worked with less.
I started with SAS, then

574
00:28:49.910 --> 00:28:51.950
I worked with less and
then I went back to

575
00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:55.190
SaaS and I think the
biggest difference around it is

576
00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:59.930
like, where's the community around
less a and B there's

577
00:28:59.930 --> 00:29:04.040
no way to contribute to
less. I think one of

578
00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:07.100
the things that's, and you
can actually see this with

579
00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:10.700
the influence of jQuery to
JavaScript. If you remember, before

580
00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:13.370
jQuery came out, JavaScript was
just kind of, this was

581
00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:19.340
like, Oh gosh, Java script,
right? Yep. And then Before,

582
00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:23.150
yes. Oh gosh, Josh got
like a JavaScript. Yes. That's

583
00:29:23.150 --> 00:29:26.030
exactly what Now it's like
JavaScript, you know, what's crazy.

584
00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:29.840
It's like the hottest thing
ever. But what jQuery did

585
00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:34.220
was that it created a
way for people to contribute

586
00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:38.390
back. And if you look
at the initial blog posts,

587
00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:40.760
like the first day, John's
like, Oh, I released it.

588
00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:43.300
And second day he was
like, I've created this way

589
00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:45.940
for people to submit plugins
and someone already submitted a

590
00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:49.540
plugin and that took off.
And that's what SAS did.

591
00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:54.100
SAS created this way for
people to share their work,

592
00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:58.240
which is really new in
CSS. You can't share your

593
00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:01.600
giant site dot CSS file.
And show me that you're

594
00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:02.950
like, I'm like, what am
I going to learn from

595
00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:05.950
this? You don't want to
see it exactly. Right. So

596
00:30:05.950 --> 00:30:07.660
now we have ways to
create tools that we can

597
00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:10.330
share and people can contribute.
And that's, and I think

598
00:30:10.330 --> 00:30:14.860
that is why SAS has
really shot ahead of all

599
00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:17.530
the other ones. It's also
just much more powerful, much

600
00:30:17.530 --> 00:30:20.730
more powerful than us. So,
Very cool. So I'm going

601
00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:22.110
to add all of the
links that we talked about

602
00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:23.910
in the show notes. People
can go to SAS cough

603
00:30:23.910 --> 00:30:28.770
this October, 2014, they can go
to the conference day. There

604
00:30:28.770 --> 00:30:30.330
is the workshops. And then
the last day is like

605
00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:34.440
an open space. As a
community day, IBM is running

606
00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:38.250
a hackathon. There's a round,
a large panel discussion between

607
00:30:38.610 --> 00:30:42.180
like Zerbe and thought bot.
And, but otherwise it's come

608
00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:44.100
share what you want to
share or hack on whatever

609
00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:46.500
you want to hack. Right.
Well, thanks so much for

610
00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:48.540
chatting with me. Thank you
so much for having me.

611
00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:51.540
This is great. This has
been another episode of Hanselminutes

612
00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:52.980
and we'll see you again
next week.
