00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.010
Hey friends, this is Scott,
and I've got a word

2
00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.410
from a new sponsor and
a really cool sponsor. In

3
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.980
fact that I use myself,
they are Sikh that's S

4
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.110
E Q, and you can
check them out at, get

5
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:15.510
seek.net. That's G E T
S E q.net. Seek is

6
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.390
the easiest way for your
team to capture and search

7
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.920
and visualize structured log events.
You probably do logging. Maybe

8
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.140
you have a node app
or an asp.net core app.

9
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.720
Move beyond text files, check
out structured, logging it, preserves

10
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.780
those individual property values. As
well as the text that's

11
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.360
associated with each event, they
get sent across the network

12
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.660
to seek which then displays
them and makes them searchable.

13
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.840
It's really easy to get
started. You can probably instrument

14
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.260
your application if you're already
using logging in just minutes,

15
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.200
just go to get seek
that's G E T S

16
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.650
E q.net. You install the
Sikh server. It's a windows

17
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.860
service, and then it listens
and handles all of the

18
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.680
logging, whether you're using no
JS and the Bunyan logging

19
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.610
library, or maybe you use
Sera log on.net or just

20
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.150
asp.net core is built in
logging. Sikh is there for

21
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.340
whatever you want to use,
whether it be.net or node

22
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.640
or Python or Java, it's
a really great product. And

23
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.950
I encourage you to check
them out and support them

24
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.680
the way that they support
us here at Hansel minutes.

25
00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.690
This is Scott Hanselman. This
is another episode of Hansel

26
00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.660
minutes. And today I'm talking
with Ahmed Abdullah from New York.

27
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.690
How are you, sir? I'm
doing pretty well. Can't complain.

28
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.970
How are you? I'm very
well and happy to be

29
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.150
chatting with you. So you're
a software engineer working software

30
00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.730
engineering. You've been a software
engineer for, for many years,

31
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.630
but I bumped into you
online when I saw you

32
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.430
teaching a new programming language
to kids. And what's interesting

33
00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.310
about it is it is
called Nore and it is

34
00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.070
written in Arabic. Is that,
is that a language that

35
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.970
you speak at home? Yes,
so I was born in

36
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.130
Sudan in Africa and I
moved to the U S

37
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.440
when I was nine years
old. So my first language

38
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.120
is actually Arabic. Sudan is
one is one of the

39
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.520
few African, maybe not the
few African countries. It's one

40
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.040
of some sort of African
countries where people speak Arabic

41
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.250
as the primary language. And
when we moved to the

42
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.870
United States, you know, my parents
spoke Arabic as their stronger

43
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.640
language. So we end up
speaking a lot of Arabic

44
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.680
at home, so good medium
for us to come in,

45
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.770
to go with their parents.
You know, it's very interesting

46
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.010
is that our parents also
didn't want us to lose

47
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.140
our ability to, to speak
Arabic. But it's something that's

48
00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.380
inevitable when you move from
one country to another, where

49
00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:44.420
you're not going to be
speak while you're speaking a

50
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.320
different language. And so, as
we were getting older, our,

51
00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.090
like, we started to get
much, much me and my

52
00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.490
siblings started to get much,
much better in speaking Arabic

53
00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.490
and speaking English. And the
Arabic just started to whittle

54
00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.890
down. So our parents started
ordering the textbooks for Arabic,

55
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.880
you know, school back home
and have them shipped here

56
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.140
so they can like teach
us. So, you know, they've

57
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.120
been fighting hard to maintain
it. And it's something that,

58
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.070
as an adult, I'm kind
of really glad I have.

59
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.450
Yeah. Would you say you're
fluent or other levels of

60
00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.680
fluency? I would say I'm
pretty fluent in speaking orally.

61
00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.770
I think my reading and
writing can definitely use some

62
00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.220
improvement. And I think just
a result of having gone

63
00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.340
to part of elementary, middle
school, high school college here.

64
00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.160
Yeah. And it was all
in English and I never

65
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.970
took an Arabic class because
I knew, you know, I

66
00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.920
knew a lot of the
basics that were taught in

67
00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.340
Arabic courses. I think one
thing that is definitely like

68
00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.310
an area of that could
improve at as like certainly

69
00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.380
my classical Arabic and modern
standard Arabic. But like if,

70
00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.820
if you got like a
copy of the Martian in

71
00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.190
Arabic, you'd be like, no
problem. You can read the

72
00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.950
whole novel. It depends on
how the Marshall has written.

73
00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.920
If it's, if it's like
modern standard Arabic, it might

74
00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.920
be a little bit difficult,
but I would think I'd

75
00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.470
be able to get through
it. Okay. So now you're

76
00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.690
a programmer. And what are
the languages that you program

77
00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.390
in, in your kind of
day job? So right now

78
00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.800
I primarily use Java Java
Java script. Before that I

79
00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.900
used a lot of Python
and Java script. So those

80
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.940
are the two, you know,
three languages. I've worked a

81
00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.540
lot with <inaudible>. And at
what point did you have

82
00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.460
an inspiration to say that
I want to see what

83
00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.550
a programming language looks like
that doesn't use standard English

84
00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.240
or standard Latin characters. So
this happened about several years

85
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.230
ago, there's a programmer in
Brooklyn, released an Arabic programming

86
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:38.010
language called club, or, you
know, pronounced in his dialogue

87
00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.440
is called ed. And it's
the name of the language

88
00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.680
means heart. And I saw
the language on hacker news.

89
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.840
It was posted that day
and thought it was just

90
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.000
super cool. And I was
like, Whoa, somebody created an

91
00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.130
Arabic programming language. And I
never thought that would be

92
00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.290
possible. And you know, my
head was like, well, this

93
00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.900
is the first Arabic programming
language ever. And then at

94
00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.380
the time, one thing about
that language was it was

95
00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:03.510
a functional lisp style, Arabic
programming language. And at the

96
00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.580
time I've been doing a
lot of Python programming. And

97
00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.110
before that, you know, even
a little bit of Java

98
00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.570
programming. And so I was
fully like in this object

99
00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.690
oriented imperative procedural sort of
world. And I was like

100
00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.050
looking at, you know, clearly
been, I was like, eh,

101
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.180
like I think this is
a great idea. And I

102
00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.730
think it would be like
super great if like Arabic

103
00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:24.630
speaking kids could like have
access to an Arabic programming

104
00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.240
language to learn the fundamentals
of computer science. But this

105
00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.570
thing is, it's a list.
And I didn't feel that,

106
00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.320
you know, the functional or
lists languages were so intuitive.

107
00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.180
And of course that was
my ignorance at the time,

108
00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.940
because at the time I
hadn't like gone deep into

109
00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.820
working with functional programming languages.
And one of the things

110
00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.760
as I would go about
and creating newer, my Arabic

111
00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.780
programming language is I would
end up studying functional program

112
00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.970
at least to understand that.
But before that, I was

113
00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:55.530
just like this ignorance about
functional programming, especially like this

114
00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:59.240
lisp style was like, I
want to take a different

115
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.280
approach to this. I think
this idea really has some

116
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.860
serious potential to it. And
some of the things that

117
00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.770
really motivated me was I
think cloud came out around

118
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.280
2013 number around that time.
There's just like this huge

119
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.400
surge for let's get everybody
to learn how to code

120
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.700
let's make programming super accessible.
I think maybe about a

121
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.490
year or two before that
is when Coursera and Udacity

122
00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.250
were created. So like this
whole revolution of let's jump

123
00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:26.810
into a learning computer science
online and for free just

124
00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:28.880
really started picking up. And
I, one of the things

125
00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.280
that sort of struck me
is that to learn computer

126
00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.160
programming, you basically have to
know how to speak in

127
00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.190
English and you have to
be pretty fluent. I think

128
00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:40.070
one of the things at
the time is a lot

129
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:41.750
of the teaching material is
in English. A lot of

130
00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:44.510
documentation. It is English. You
know, if you're running a

131
00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:46.850
compiler for language and you
get an error that, you

132
00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:48.410
know, that error and that
stack trace is all in

133
00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:51.140
English. It's like, it takes
a pretty serious amount of

134
00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:55.100
fluency in English to be
able to learn coding, to

135
00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:57.710
redox and like bootstrap herself.
And I remember like, you

136
00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:01.370
know, there were these businesses
like code Academy and a

137
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:04.040
few others that were, you
know, trying to make learning

138
00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.740
programming super easy for folks
and they would make it

139
00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:08.930
interactive and it was on
the web. So you don't

140
00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:11.270
have to download it, install
anything. It sort of struck

141
00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:13.670
me that, you know, like
maybe everybody who can speak

142
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:16.610
English will be able to
learn how to program, except

143
00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:18.080
for the people that don't
know how to speak English.

144
00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:20.540
And personally, I was born
in a village and sit

145
00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.430
down. So it was like
really poor, right? So like,

146
00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:26.750
not in like the downtown,
the apartments. Oh God. No.

147
00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:30.200
So like in my village,
in Sudan, it was probably

148
00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.390
when I was like six
years old that we got

149
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:35.840
electricity in the same village
as like around the year

150
00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:39.620
2000 that they got landlines
and phones. So it's like

151
00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:42.740
part of this village is
like mud houses and, you

152
00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:45.050
know, dirt roads. And the
other part is like brick.

153
00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.390
I think there was maybe
one person in the town

154
00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:49.670
who might've had a toilet.
So for me, I've always

155
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:52.040
had this like attachment, not
like attachment, but it's kinda

156
00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:55.130
like my early upbringing is
just this really poor, you

157
00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:56.840
know, environment. And of course,
I didn't know, it was

158
00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.700
part of, until I moved
to the U S with

159
00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:00.350
my parents and I was
like, Whoa, this is heaven.

160
00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:02.600
But before then, you know,
that was my life. And

161
00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.360
so growing up, I sort
of like thought back to

162
00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.090
this, the people I came
from and the people who

163
00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:10.790
don't have those opportunities. And
when I think of English

164
00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:13.750
specifically, I think just about
an N I don't want,

165
00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:15.050
I don't want to say
every country, but I can

166
00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:19.870
certainly say for Sudan, that
teaching English is like, it's

167
00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:22.880
like, is, is one of
the most important skills in

168
00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:25.910
the educational system. And I
think like at my village,

169
00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:27.800
it was like around fifth
grade, they would attempt to

170
00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:31.460
teach people English, but it
was like not very good

171
00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:33.260
and can, as you know,
the curriculum's already terrible and

172
00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.840
there's not a lot of
funding. If you went to

173
00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:39.230
an English or American school
in Sudan, you would come

174
00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.860
with their super solid understanding
of the English language. You

175
00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:46.100
probably come speak English without
an accent. There's just like

176
00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:49.670
a, it's like a very
immersive experience into a language

177
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:52.160
that has a lot, quite
frankly, a lot of opportunity,

178
00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:54.950
you know, opportunity for professional
development for you, you know,

179
00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:59.190
education abroad. But also as
I started to think about

180
00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:02.280
it, when cloud came out,
it's also the language, English

181
00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:05.160
is the language you need
to get into programming. And

182
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.470
so when I saw Glenn,
of course, I, at the

183
00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:09.450
time, I didn't know how
to create a programming language.

184
00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:12.120
I've never attempted to create
a program. And I, myself,

185
00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:14.540
I'm a self taught developer.
So a lot of the

186
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:17.310
things I picked up were
relevant to the job in

187
00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:20.250
my work that, you know,
and so then one day

188
00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:23.100
I decided to apply to
the Recurse center, which is

189
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:25.860
a place here in New York
city. It's like a writer's

190
00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:29.700
retreat for programmers. And basically
people take off take about

191
00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.040
three months off from their
work and they come and

192
00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:34.830
work on any project they
want. And so of course

193
00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:37.770
in my head, I was
like, ah, like that Arabic

194
00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:39.750
program and Linda's idea I
really wanted to work on,

195
00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:41.220
I think this might be
a good place to do

196
00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:45.960
it. And so I came
to the Recurse center and

197
00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:48.240
of course I, you know,
I have zero background in

198
00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:52.260
creating programming languages. Didn't know
where to start. And I

199
00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:56.070
bumped into a rehearsal at
the time, Ken Pratt, a

200
00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:59.550
really good friend of mine.
He pointed me to this

201
00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:01.860
really good book called crate
your own programming language. And

202
00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:04.710
I can give you a
link to the book later

203
00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:06.540
on. And so I read
this book and it talks

204
00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:09.990
about how it gives you
the, this, like the understanding

205
00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:11.640
you need to build a
programming language. And I think

206
00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:14.160
this is also, this is
the same book that helped

207
00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.010
Jeremy Ashkenaz create coffee script.
So I'm like, Oh, this

208
00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:19.200
book must be legit. Cause
you know, Jeremy Washington office was

209
00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.430
inspired to create coffee script
after reading this book. And

210
00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:24.720
it'll totally help me and,
you know, picking up all

211
00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.970
the fundamentals. So between this
book and a few other

212
00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:29.700
programming language books, I'd piece
together, what I needed to

213
00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:32.550
know about how programming languages
work in terms of, you

214
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:34.560
know, you have a grammar
file and you have a

215
00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:38.580
parser and Lexar and you
have interpreter compiler, all these

216
00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:42.030
like nitty gritty things. You
need to build up program

217
00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:46.770
language. And I started off
at the time by after

218
00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:48.450
and after I finished reading
this book and a few

219
00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:50.520
other books as it, I
told myself, I'm going to

220
00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:53.640
write my own lecture, write
my own parser. I don't

221
00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:55.710
need to use any tools,
yak, Lex, none of these

222
00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:58.280
things. That's a little bold
right there. When did you

223
00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:02.690
think? Yeah. I mean, it's
just saying like, well let

224
00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:05.840
me, let me rephrase. I
apologize. I mean more like

225
00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:09.770
lecture like parser, like that's
the least fun part of

226
00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:11.720
doing a programming language, like
coming up with the keywords

227
00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:14.180
and the structure doing the
actual like bite for bite

228
00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:17.360
parsing. That's no fun. Right?
Well, so for me I

229
00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.400
was like, look, I need
to be able to control

230
00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:22.190
every aspect of this because
you know, I'm dealing with

231
00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:24.500
Arabic texts and I don't
know what issues will come

232
00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:27.620
up, but I will not
control. That is a very

233
00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:29.690
good point. There's a lot
of times where you might

234
00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:32.630
assume that the, that the
text is going to be

235
00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:35.120
parsed a certain way and
of course, programming languages and

236
00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:38.210
lectures. And yakkers often think
about things bite for bite,

237
00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:42.110
but Arabic not only right
to left, but the biter

238
00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:46.970
rays are UTF eight. Yes.
And actually, even before I

239
00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:49.340
attempted to create my own
like parser and lecture, one

240
00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:52.640
of the experiments I did
is I thought, well, maybe

241
00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:56.110
I can just an existing
English programming language to Arabic

242
00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.480
and maybe that would just
solve the job. And of

243
00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.910
course, you know, I wanted
like I wanted a language

244
00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:04.420
to be like algal based,
you know, a little bit,

245
00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:07.120
you know, imperative. And so
I went with Python and

246
00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:09.820
so like, you know, clone
Python locally went to the

247
00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:12.910
grammar file and I added
Arabic keywords to the grammar

248
00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:16.390
file, compiled it, you know,
ran my interpreter and I

249
00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:18.970
punched my Arabic keywords in
the rappel and I didn't

250
00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:22.850
get a D they didn't
register. Like they didn't evaluate

251
00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:26.650
into anything. And so I
tried different English, key words

252
00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:30.820
for the same Python grammar
file and those different keywords

253
00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:32.920
worked just fine. So I
knew that if I edited

254
00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:35.710
the grammar file, compiled the
language, you know, everything's smooth.

255
00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:38.080
And just after a little
bit more research, I basically

256
00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:43.120
came to realize that the
Lexar parser for Python doesn't

257
00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:48.430
support the parsing of non
ASCII characters. And so while

258
00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:52.040
the language at the top,
like does support, you know,

259
00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:56.290
this have support for utfh
and Unicode add in the

260
00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:58.450
grammar file. I couldn't get
it. And I think it's

261
00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:01.210
probably perhaps cause they're really
old technology, perhaps it wasn't

262
00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:03.520
an idea that was thought
of at the time or

263
00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:07.210
needed. So I didn't try
it. And I, even if

264
00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:08.800
I had been able to
get it and even if

265
00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.810
there was just something I
missed and it, maybe it

266
00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:13.870
really is doable, it raised
that there's another level of

267
00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:17.170
concern I had, which is,
you know, Python, the structure

268
00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:20.080
of it still goes from
left to right. And if

269
00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:23.890
I write an Arabic keyword,
you know, like Def you

270
00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:25.870
know, if I write that
from Arabic in Arabic and

271
00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:28.210
it goes from right to
left, then the next word

272
00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:30.520
is going to have it
to be to the right

273
00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:33.040
of that. So it's like,
you'll have certain keywords going

274
00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:35.110
from right to left, but
the language flow is still

275
00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:39.280
from left to right. And
I thought that just like

276
00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:41.650
converting a few keywords here
and there might not really

277
00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:44.500
do it. It might be,
I might just have to

278
00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:48.940
like start from scratch and
go from there. And so

279
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.920
of course, you know, after
you get a book like

280
00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:53.290
any programmer, you think, wow,
I can do anything. Now

281
00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.180
I read this book and
I know how this works.

282
00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.020
And let's just say like
about after a week or

283
00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:01.960
two of running my own
parser in lecture, it was

284
00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:03.400
just, I was just like,
all right, this is just

285
00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:06.220
too much. It's just too
many bugs. And off by

286
00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:08.020
one errors, I just like
not, I don't want to

287
00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:09.490
deal with this. So this
one I really started to

288
00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:12.700
think about like, maybe I
really should use something else

289
00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:16.150
to do this. And I
started looking to, you know,

290
00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:18.820
the various tools that I
had read about, but none

291
00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:21.400
of them really, I think
the one that appealed to

292
00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:25.030
me the most of the
time was peg JS parser,

293
00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:29.890
especially in grammar for, in
Pegasus implemented in JavaScript and

294
00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:33.250
pegs. Are these, these like
grammar formalism? I don't know.

295
00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:34.780
I don't really know how
to describe it that, well,

296
00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:37.780
it's basically like a tool
that generates compilers for you.

297
00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:39.850
So what you do is
you give it your grammar

298
00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:43.770
file and It's similar to
the way Lexan yak works.

299
00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:46.440
You basically are writing in
your peg. You can go

300
00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:50.310
to peg js.org/online. You can
see it actually in place

301
00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:53.210
where you, you write the
grammar, you say express, this

302
00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:55.130
is an expression and that's
a factor and that's an

303
00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:57.860
integer and this is a
term and you're using their

304
00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:02.750
language to generate code in
your language. Right? And the

305
00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:05.470
grammar is like an EBNF
grammar of you. You have

306
00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:09.550
like these recursive definitions of
the, of how your grammar

307
00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:13.510
is broken down into like
the base Adams. And so

308
00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:16.390
I started off by creating
Just before you move on,

309
00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:21.310
to be sure. He just
said, EBNF, that means extended

310
00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:24.640
buckets now, or form. And
it's part of a meta

311
00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:28.150
family, medicine techs, family of
notations. It's a very, very

312
00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:32.500
old grammar. That's now a
standard. So peg JS is

313
00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:37.660
using that, that EBNF grammar
style, correct? Yes. Just want

314
00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:39.550
to give the context cause
not everybody knows what that

315
00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:43.570
acronym means. No, definitely. Thank
you for that. Of course.

316
00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:47.200
So I started creating my
grammar file and as a,

317
00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:50.620
and as I add different
rules and into the grammar

318
00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:53.260
file out den gut, run
it through peg JS and

319
00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:57.100
I would get an abstract
syntax tree if some, so

320
00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:59.590
Peggy S would generate the
compiler and then you take

321
00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:02.560
your language source code and
you run it through the

322
00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:04.720
compiler. And what you get
out of it is the

323
00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:07.150
abstract syntax tree. And then
it's up to the developer

324
00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:11.050
to take that abstract syntax
tree and evaluated, interpret it

325
00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:13.930
as they wish. And so
my language being implemented in

326
00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:16.720
Java script, I would just
take the different nodes and

327
00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:20.320
I in this abstract syntax
tree. And like if say,

328
00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:22.270
you know, this was a
function in vocation, then that

329
00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:24.490
means it's, this is the
part of the language where

330
00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:26.560
somebody is trying to call
a function. And so I

331
00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:29.800
would, you know, do the
necessary parts of calling a

332
00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:31.420
function. If I had to
look up variables from the

333
00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:33.220
stack. I mean, at this
point it just like gets

334
00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:36.910
into like the details of
implementing an interpreter or language.

335
00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:39.490
I think one of the
things that like was also

336
00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:41.680
an option for me at
the time was to perhaps

337
00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:45.310
compile my language to another
language like JavaScript itself and

338
00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:50.710
have like JavaScript run the
JavaScript code, like V8 or

339
00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:54.910
no Dren JavaScript code. So
I can basically transpiling my

340
00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:57.610
language to another language, but
as I was in the

341
00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:00.730
choice I had chosen to
do at the time, so

342
00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:02.110
there was like a lot
of options, but I think

343
00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:04.930
using a tool like peg
JS was just super helpful.

344
00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.000
And I think now there's
another tool that I came

345
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.640
across called home. And if
I had to go back

346
00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:12.670
out, you know, especially looking
to own home is also

347
00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:16.750
tag-based compiler generator. That's has
a lot of, a lot

348
00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:19.450
of utilities to help you
like debug and introspect the

349
00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:23.410
language and the grammar that
you're generating and building, Hey

350
00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:26.140
folks, Intel is a sponsor
this week and I welcome

351
00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:29.710
them because they're bringing some
high performance developer tools for

352
00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:33.880
all of us check out
Intel's parallel studio X, E

353
00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:36.670
I've talked about parallelism before
on the show and the

354
00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:40.540
importance of using the complete
instruction set, unlocking the power

355
00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:42.520
of the process or that
your code is running on.

356
00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:45.220
Now, you all might be
writing C or C plus

357
00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:48.910
plus Python or even Fortran,
but is your code building

358
00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:50.730
in a way and written
in such a way that

359
00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:56.970
it uses the latest techniques
for vectorization multithreading multi-node parallelization

360
00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.260
or memory optimization? Intel parallel
studio ECC has a lot

361
00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:04.620
of new stuff for 2018
across all these languages. Get

When you, when you did

367
00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:31.470
this the F the first
time were you thinking it

368
00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:37.110
would be entirely Arabic, including
Arabic equivalents for numbers, even

369
00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:40.290
though we're all using the
Arabic numeral system like you,

370
00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:42.420
did you want the whole
thing to be as Arabic

371
00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:44.880
as possible and stay in
the Arabic typefaces and the

372
00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:47.970
Arabic style? Or do you
have anything where you switch

373
00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:50.640
into, like, if you use
like numbers, are you using

374
00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:52.530
the Arabic numerals or are
you going to put in

375
00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:55.520
like four? So I didn't
get into the part of

376
00:18:55.520 --> 00:19:00.260
supporting the numbers in like
the, like the Arabic numerals

377
00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:03.080
to clarify that the Arabic
new are, as, as you

378
00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:06.740
mentioned earlier, the ones we
use and the numerals used

379
00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:09.230
oftentimes in the Arabic world
are like, we're called like

380
00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:15.080
the Indian numerals. Yeah. And
so it uses the Indian

381
00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:19.070
numerals as the numbers and
the language, if you want

382
00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:22.190
to, I didn't yet get
around to adding support for

383
00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:24.800
like English numerals or anything.
Do you think those kinds

384
00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.020
of things matter? Like I
understand that there's lots of

385
00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:31.880
languages where they have a
great language, like Ethiopian Amharic

386
00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:35.630
is one I'm very familiar
with their numeral system though,

387
00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:38.900
is so goofy that a
lot of Ethiopians are just

388
00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:42.050
like, ah, forget it. We'll
just use like American numerals

389
00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:45.140
or standard English numerals. It's
just easier. Or do you

390
00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:47.450
think when, when doing a
language that is not English

391
00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:50.720
there there's value in kind
of pushing aside all of

392
00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:53.180
the Western things and trying
to see if you can

393
00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:56.750
do it the whole way
in that local language. So

394
00:19:56.750 --> 00:20:00.050
I think for me, a
lot of the things that

395
00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:02.100
are guiding my decisions, a
lot of the values were

396
00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:05.150
where, how would I want
to, how would I have

397
00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:06.980
learned to use this language?
If I was a little

398
00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:10.640
kid, would this language have
taught me Yeah. As a

399
00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:13.730
learning journey. Yeah. As far
as learning journey, that's really

400
00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:15.980
what I was trying to
answer as I was making

401
00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:20.360
different decisions. And when it
comes to the numerals, I

402
00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:23.480
first started off with supporting
the Indian numerals, which are

403
00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:25.100
what it used back when
I grow up, when I

404
00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:28.550
grew up, that was one
of the common number systems.

405
00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:33.050
But I also did understand,
you know, the Arabic numerals

406
00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:35.600
that we use here today,
commonly in the U S.

407
00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:39.680
And so they were like
further away, but they weren't

408
00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:41.930
like, Oh, I would never
have this because it has

409
00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:43.430
to be this way, or
it needs to be that

410
00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:46.130
way. But it was more
like from the first person

411
00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:48.550
view of me as a
little, what was familiar to

412
00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:51.600
me at a time. Right.
And the idea that like

413
00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:55.560
a computer understands me, it
can make people who speak

414
00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:58.530
only English or listening should
use this as an opportunity

415
00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:01.440
to think outside their box
and think to themselves what

416
00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:04.470
if computers and the internet
and the, the thing that

417
00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:08.490
is taking over the world,
tech didn't speak my language.

418
00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:11.010
Like, what does that feel
like? Cause a lot, a

419
00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:13.410
lot of people, and I
wrote an article about this

420
00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:14.910
10 years ago called do
you have to know English

421
00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:17.610
to be a programmer? It's
become the lingua franca, which

422
00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:21.660
is funny cause that's French
of, of the internet. But

423
00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:24.240
is that, is that okay?
Cause it is such a

424
00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:26.460
barrier. It really, isn't just
a matter of learning 10

425
00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:30.900
keywords, is it? Yeah. And
I think in like relative

426
00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:33.750
to the way I grew
up in Sudan to be

427
00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:36.660
fluent in English, you basically
have to be wealthy. There's

428
00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:39.690
a lot of people in
Sudan that don't have access

429
00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:44.010
to like great American schools,
you know, English schools, international

430
00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:46.380
schools, where you can come
with a really strong English

431
00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:50.670
background. And so for me,
it was just sort of

432
00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:53.490
thinking like, ah, I was
too poor. I grew up

433
00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:56.940
too poor to have been
able to learn programming by

434
00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:59.430
myself. If I had come
to be a teenager and

435
00:21:59.430 --> 00:22:01.080
I was interested in it.
And I thought a lot

436
00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:04.770
of like the concepts in
computer science, you know, looping

437
00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:10.320
functions, arithmetic, and all these
different concepts are pretty language

438
00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:14.280
agnostic. They're just algorithms that
you can learn. And regardless

439
00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:17.760
of the medium one is
able to learn them. And

440
00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:19.320
I knew that, you know,
even if I had like

441
00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:23.190
created the perfect language experience,
you know, you would still

442
00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:25.230
need to learn English to
be able to build anything

443
00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:30.130
significant because right now the
whole stack, you know, in,

444
00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:32.100
in a computer is, is
based on, you need to

445
00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:34.410
know English. There's no way
around it. But I think

446
00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:37.540
to get people started. Yeah,
go ahead. I'm sorry. I

447
00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:39.360
do want to dig in
though to a couple of

448
00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:41.850
other things before we run
out of time thinking about

449
00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:44.400
some of the criticisms that
were very valid and interesting

450
00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:47.670
online, but I was looking
through the source code before

451
00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:50.100
we get into that. And
I noticed something interesting where

452
00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:54.630
you made a change when
you're describing a function or

453
00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:57.480
a worker, you have both
the male and the feminine,

454
00:22:57.690 --> 00:23:00.150
the masculine and the feminine,
you know, in English, we

455
00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:04.620
don't really think about nouns
or things having gender, but

456
00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:07.080
virtually every other language in
the world does have this

457
00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:09.300
idea of like, you know,
a TV is a man

458
00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:12.240
and a pen is a
woman and you have two

459
00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:15.960
keywords then to describe a
function or a worker. Yes.

460
00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:18.210
That's something I was thinking
about is, you know, if

461
00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:21.540
you were a little kid,
you know, a little boy,

462
00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:25.350
a little girl, and I
now, how would it impacted

463
00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:28.920
you if everything was done
from the perspective of like

464
00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:31.800
these masculine objects and I
just wasn't sure. And it's

465
00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:33.330
kind of like, yeah, I
could have a go either

466
00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:35.190
way. And so when I
think of like the way

467
00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:38.730
to define a function, it's
a, I, I, I'm trying

468
00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:40.920
to describe it in like
kid like talk or toy

469
00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:44.430
talk, which as I said,
instruct a worker and I'm

470
00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:47.990
trying to think is worker,
you know, a male worker

471
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:51.140
or a female worker. And
I'm like, well, it's the

472
00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:53.690
grammar file. I can update
it to have both. And

473
00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:56.300
I'll figure that out later,
you know, what's ideal. What's

474
00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:58.850
not ideal was this even
a necessary debate? And so

475
00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:00.530
I don't have the final
answer to that as I

476
00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:03.730
just wanted to, I wanted
it to be inclusive. Yeah.

477
00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:06.790
And that is interesting because
it does, as we are

478
00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:10.060
saying before, if you're experiencing
computers for the first time

479
00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:13.270
and they are things that
are inherently English, that's going

480
00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:15.580
to make you feel some
kind of way. And if

481
00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:19.000
you introduce, you got introduced
to a language as a

482
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.270
young Arabic speaking girl, and
then everything is a male

483
00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:25.150
noun. You might feel some
kind of way. We don't

484
00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:28.780
know what that is, but
it closes the door just

485
00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:32.710
a little bit closer and
a little bit tighter. Definitely.

486
00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:36.820
And I think also on
the point of criticism regarding

487
00:24:37.030 --> 00:24:39.580
the grammar and the key
words, a lot of the

488
00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:41.770
grammar choices I had made
were from the spectrum of

489
00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:44.620
my own Sudanese dialect. And
whereas I had learned to

490
00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:48.700
speak and for people not
familiar with, you know, the

491
00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:52.240
Arabic language and Arabic, Arabic
speaking countries is that normally

492
00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:55.840
there's like a local dialect
to a given country. So

493
00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:59.230
like in Sudan, we have
our own dialect in Syria.

494
00:24:59.230 --> 00:25:01.000
They have their own dialect
in Egypt. They have their

495
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.860
own dialect, Gulf, Arabic countries
like Saudi Arabia, Qatar Amman, you

496
00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:09.040
know, Dubai, the UAE in
general, they all have their

497
00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:12.640
own like, you know, pretty
similar yet different Arabic dialects.

498
00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:15.550
And these are dialects that
are just local to those

499
00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:19.000
countries and those groups. And
then you have, what's known

500
00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.360
as modern standard Arabic, which
is like a level of,

501
00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:25.060
it's like a form of
Arabic. That's, it's Arabic. That's

502
00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:27.220
more, that's the formal, Arabic
is the one you would

503
00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:29.560
use in the news. It's
the one you would write

504
00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:31.720
and publish books and essays.
And it's the one you

505
00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:35.980
would go to court and
draft contracts with. You have

506
00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:38.920
classical Arabic, which is like
this really, really old Arabic.

507
00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:41.350
You can sort of think
of it as like Shakespearian

508
00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:45.010
English. It's, it's, you know,
it's still very important, very

509
00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:48.760
rich, but it's also not
something, you know, We'll use

510
00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:51.880
data, not how people chat
on the street. Right. And

511
00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:54.580
so in general, in the
Arabic world, when you create

512
00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.650
a piece of work and
you want it to be

513
00:25:56.710 --> 00:26:00.400
a transferrable, you would sort
of do it from, you'd

514
00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:03.100
probably choose modern standard Arabic
because it's just something people

515
00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:05.170
in all the different countries
will get taught or, you

516
00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:07.450
know, can get tired. They
have access to, Yeah. Is

517
00:26:07.450 --> 00:26:10.450
this something where like, I,
as a, as an American

518
00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:13.690
go and I write something
and I use like elevator

519
00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:15.670
and apartment, and then I
send it off to England

520
00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:17.380
and they're like, no, it
should be lifted and flat.

521
00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:20.350
Or is it more, is
it more than that? Yeah.

522
00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:24.460
It's very similar to that.
It can be more than

523
00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:27.010
that in that there's a
lot of Arabic speaking countries

524
00:26:27.010 --> 00:26:31.810
and sometimes they're local, the
dialects diverge re you know,

525
00:26:31.810 --> 00:26:36.100
really heavily. So for example,
like I can understand it

526
00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:39.490
gives you an Arabic pretty
well. I can understand Syrian

527
00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:42.340
or levantan or, you know,
that area is call it

528
00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:45.120
a sham. I can just
understand that pretty well. I

529
00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:47.040
can start in golf, Eric
pretty well, but I absolutely

530
00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:51.930
can not understand Moroccan Arabic
Algerian or because, because it's

531
00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:54.960
just so heavily, like mixed
with French. And it's just,

532
00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:56.400
they've just got their own
take on a lot of

533
00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:59.940
different words that it's just
not something I'm at all

534
00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:02.240
familiar with. Well, as, as,
as someone whose family is

535
00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:04.310
from Scotland, I feel the
same way about my Scottish

536
00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:06.830
uncles and aunts. And they're
all speaking. They tell me

537
00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:10.760
they're speaking English, but who
knows? Yeah. Now, one thing

538
00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:12.230
that was interesting as we
put this out on the,

539
00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:14.210
on Twitter, and it turned
into a very, very interesting

540
00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:17.090
conversation because a lot of
my followers on Twitter from

541
00:27:17.090 --> 00:27:20.570
Arabic speaking countries, and even
just now, as we're speaking,

542
00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:22.280
I put an article out
and asked a couple of

543
00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:25.730
questions and I have one
gentleman from Sudan who was

544
00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:29.450
talking about the first language
or the language that was

545
00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:32.450
your inspiration Kolbe. And he
was saying how funny he

546
00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:36.020
thought it was that the
gentleman who created Kolbe wrote

547
00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:39.740
the word Lambda, rather than
writing it as Lambda. He

548
00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:43.220
wrote it in transliterated Arabic,
which isn't a word it

549
00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:46.640
spells out Lambda. So someone
who could read Arabic would

550
00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:48.470
go, Oh, Lambda, but you
still have to know what

551
00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:51.140
that is, which seems so
funny to me, given that

552
00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:54.650
Arabs created an algebra. Yeah.
So it's a lot of

553
00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:56.450
words that are like in
use today in a lot

554
00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:58.550
of different sciences and math.
I don't, I, I don't

555
00:27:58.550 --> 00:28:00.410
want to say that there
isn't an Arabic equivalent to

556
00:28:00.410 --> 00:28:03.500
just maybe one that we
haven't come across. And I

557
00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:06.560
think one of the tricky
things is like, you know,

558
00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:08.750
if you come across like
an iPhone, like what is

559
00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:11.690
an iPhone? Like, like what
is, you know, in English,

560
00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:14.090
it sorta makes sense. There's
the letter I meaning me.

561
00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:17.510
And there's the word phone?
And like, do you transliterate

562
00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:21.050
that into, you know, Well,
here's the deal. Here's a

563
00:28:21.050 --> 00:28:23.330
funny, here's a funny, like
random thing. So my wife

564
00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:29.510
speaks Zulu, Adele dialect called
endive Ellie at home. And

565
00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:34.490
if you spell iPhone before
the iPhone existed, it says

566
00:28:34.670 --> 00:28:39.020
<inaudible>, which means the phone.
So if I was sitting

567
00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:41.000
with her and I would
say hand me the phone,

568
00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:47.090
I would say fairly fun,
fun. And now it's like

569
00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:51.200
finally iPhone. So now we're
like, do we put two

570
00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:54.170
eyes? Is it I phone?
Like, what are you, how

571
00:28:54.170 --> 00:28:56.840
do we say this now?
Because they've a word that

572
00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:58.700
was a word that meant
something. Now it means something

573
00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:02.720
else. Yeah, definitely. But you
brought up a very interesting

574
00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:05.360
point, which is one of
the last parts that I

575
00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:07.190
am doing. And I want
to do more research in

576
00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:13.100
is what are the common
math terms in Arabic to

577
00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:14.930
a lot of different things
that we use today in

578
00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:17.600
programming, such as Lambda, what's
the Arabic equivalent of that?

579
00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:20.750
Or what are the ways,
because it's one thing I

580
00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:25.160
can just take English programming,
language terms and transliterate them

581
00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:27.380
and say, now you have
to understand them is just

582
00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:31.640
written in your alphabet. It
still doesn't have any inherent

583
00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:34.220
meaning. And so then I
think one of the things

584
00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:37.730
that stumped me is, is,
you know, I didn't learn,

585
00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:40.970
you know, you know, Cal
can pre-calc and algebra one

586
00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:44.710
trig and differential equations in
Arabic. I learned it in

587
00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:47.110
English, right? So part of
my issue is that I'm

588
00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:50.020
coming to it from an
English perspective. But if I

589
00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:53.350
could find textbooks, if somebody,
one of your listeners has

590
00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:56.200
like resources, I'd love to
see and get like immersed

591
00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:59.200
in this, myself from the
Erik perspective. Because right now

592
00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:03.520
you're right, like doing a
one-to-one mapping of a keyword

593
00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:06.520
to a keyword is one
way to design a language

594
00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:12.820
and doing a, but doing
a, an idiomatic, you know,

595
00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:17.170
at, at Arabic, at its
heart, without, without knowing an

596
00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:23.050
English language first might have
a different result. Yeah. One

597
00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:25.060
of the things I also
also thinking about is, as

598
00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:27.250
I was creating this language,
some of the things that

599
00:30:27.250 --> 00:30:30.220
I was like debating between
where, you know, how do

600
00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:32.920
I go about implementing packages
and modules? How do I

601
00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:35.410
go about doing this and
that? And I was like

602
00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:37.630
looking at taking a lot
of different inspiration from the

603
00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:40.780
programming languages I used to
work with, what are the

604
00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:42.640
best ways to teach computer
science? And that's when I

605
00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:44.920
started to think about, you
know, it's not just text-based

606
00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:48.490
and used to be like
graphical and visual feedback related

607
00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:53.170
and oriented into the mechanism.
Yeah. Yeah. So, so there's

608
00:30:53.170 --> 00:30:55.300
a lot of things to
solve here. We're so far

609
00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:57.400
in the future here, we
know we have virtual reality

610
00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:02.590
and pocket supercomputers. Why is
it still them and texts

611
00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:05.110
that we're doing all of
our talking to the computer

612
00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:09.790
with. Right. And I don't
have the answer either. Yeah.

613
00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:12.640
And so I think that's,
you know, to make it

614
00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.060
more palatable and easiest to
learn, to add things like

615
00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:19.900
time travel and the visual
visual feedback, I think Khan

616
00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:22.600
Academy does a really good
job of this, the way

617
00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:25.780
they teach computer science programming,
they use, like you can

618
00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:27.670
write a function to draw
a rectangle, and then you

619
00:31:27.670 --> 00:31:31.090
can like alter the arguments
that rectangle and watch it

620
00:31:31.090 --> 00:31:34.240
resize on the right hand
side of the screen. Yeah.

621
00:31:34.250 --> 00:31:37.450
Yeah. Things like the Swift
playground or Xamarin workbooks where

622
00:31:37.450 --> 00:31:41.260
you're typing and the code
is running, is always running

623
00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:45.490
is definitely a better experience
than the whole compile hit

624
00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:49.660
refresh experience that we're having
today. Cool. Well, this is

625
00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:51.430
great. And thank you so
much for talking to me.

626
00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:53.740
And would you encourage other
people try to write their

627
00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:58.090
own programming language? Definitely. Absolutely.
I think once you get

628
00:31:58.090 --> 00:32:00.220
started is I think I
personally found to be really

629
00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:02.140
addicting and I think it's
a great way to increase

630
00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:04.960
your programming skills as well.
Fantastic. Well, I'm going to

631
00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:07.270
send a put in links
in the show notes to

632
00:32:07.630 --> 00:32:10.360
nor to call over to
my article on, do you

633
00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:12.280
need to know English to
be a programmer as well

634
00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:14.710
as paying JS and the
other resources, including the book,

635
00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:17.350
create your own programming language
that we talked about. Thanks

636
00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:19.750
so much for chatting with
me today. Thank you for

637
00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:23.320
having me. This has been
another episode of Hansel minutes

638
00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:46.060
and we'll see you again
next week. <inaudible>.
