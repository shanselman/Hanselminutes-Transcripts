00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.740
this episode, Scott talks with
Willow brew from geeks without

9
00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:01.760
bounds and accelerator for humanitarian
projects. Hi, this is Scott

10
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.190
Hanselman. This is another episode
of Hansel minutes and I've

11
00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.430
got Willow brew from geeks
without bounds on the phone.

12
00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.820
How are you? I'm great.
How are you doing Lovely.

13
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.850
Lovely. I am checking out
your website and I love

14
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.830
this and accelerator for humanitarian
projects. You get geeks and

15
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.450
charities together. Don't you Sort
of less so with charities

16
00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:30.440
more with, with nonprofits and
humanitarian response groups, disaster response

17
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.640
groups who would benefit from
there from geeky talents. Ah,

18
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.160
okay. So man, so like
if there's a disaster, if

19
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.500
there's a hurricane crisis camps,
things like that. Yeah. We

20
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.100
help out with, with response,
the tools that people use

21
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.490
when they're in the field.
Okay. And how does this,

22
00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.950
how is it organized? I
mean, do you, do you

23
00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.140
do this on a monthly
basis or are there teams

24
00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.530
that go like quarterly is
just like doctors without borders

25
00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.670
except with programmers. And that
was the initial idea, but

26
00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.950
now we, the accelerator, each
accelerator round is six months.

27
00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.710
And so we open up
a round for applications every

28
00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.230
six months and people apply
and then we provide them

29
00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.030
mentorship during that time period.
The other things that we're

30
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.460
involved with, like the hackathons
and the crisis camps and

31
00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.580
everything else that happened on
a much more regular schedule.

32
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.170
Okay. Okay. And is this
something like that I would

33
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.640
have to take time off
of work or how would

34
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.920
I do this? If I
were going to be a

35
00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:37.370
geek without bounds Right now
it's it's volunteer time. We

36
00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.440
don't have a way of
we're. We're hoping eventually to

37
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.810
be able to provide teams
with stipends so that they

38
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.470
can really focus on, on
building their tool. But right

39
00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.420
now we're not in a
place to do that. So

40
00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.020
it is something that's spare
time. When I think about

41
00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.040
like, you know, Superstorm Sandy
or something like that, and

42
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.670
that you might need crisis
response. I usually think of

43
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.460
young people who somehow either
have a low financial burn

44
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.310
rate. Maybe they're like they
just live in a house

45
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:07.930
with a bunch of other
folks. So like the idea

46
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.270
of taking some time off
of work and then flying

47
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.450
across the country and shovel-ready
get on the ground and

48
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.660
help people out is one
thing, are these, are these

49
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.140
geeks doing that? Are they
kind of taking vacation or

50
00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.290
taking time off flying across
the country and then working

51
00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.360
on the ground? Or is
this something that they're doing

52
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.280
with GitHub and they're doing
it distributed. There are some

53
00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.370
people who do show up
to the event. I was

54
00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.590
one, but one of the
things about either digital humanitarian

55
00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.860
response or a volunteer technical
community response is that you

56
00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.040
can do it from your
own home. There was one

57
00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.860
thing that was built called
map mill, which was basically

58
00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.570
hot or not for damage
assessment where after a natural

59
00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.140
disaster, there's a group called
civil air patrol that flies

60
00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.460
and they take aerial images
of, of an area. And

61
00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.900
then what, what a group
did was, and this happened

62
00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.410
in advance and then we
deployed it during Sandy. They

63
00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.490
had built out a way
for those images to be

64
00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.340
geo located and then people
can flip through and say,

65
00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.180
there's no damage. There's light
damage, there's heavy damage. And

66
00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.910
that was crowdsourced essentially. And
no one had to leave

67
00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.750
their couch. And that was
done by, by people like

68
00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.670
Skylar and Kate from open
humanitarian open street map, team

69
00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:33.180
hot. And, and that was
something that then you have

70
00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.660
a heat map of where
damages and, and FEMA and

71
00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.530
whoever else can go in
and, and figure out where

72
00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.350
to go instead of waiting
for official requests. It's really,

73
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:48.180
really cool Tools like that,
that they met seems amazing.

74
00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.330
I would, I would guess
that the hardest part would

75
00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.810
be letting other agencies know
that those tools exist. Like,

76
00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.270
it seems like I'm always
hearing about like amazing tools

77
00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.330
or utilities. And then I
wonder, do they become the

78
00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.440
standard tool that everyone knows
about? Or, or do you

79
00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.200
still struggle? Like everyone should
know about this freaking tool?

80
00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.960
Well, the thing about when
you're talking to well established

81
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.910
groups like civil air patrol
and FEMA and national guard,

82
00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:21.360
they have, they have to
use tools that they know

83
00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.870
can work. You can't use
something that is under the,

84
00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.100
the release early and release
often we'll fix bugs in

85
00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.890
poli you, it has to
work. People are relying on

86
00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:35.970
it. And so there's a
really has a really high

87
00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.630
barrier to getting people to
use new tools. But one

88
00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.280
of the other things that
we did in the field

89
00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:46.440
was start using Hackpad, which
is my favorite co-editing platform

90
00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.350
for, for documents. And that's
one of the things where

91
00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:51.630
you can just put it
in front of people and

92
00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.810
they know how to use
it, but because it is

93
00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:58.100
alive collaboration, it's something that
you can use in the

94
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.590
field when all of the
networks are down. It's not,

95
00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:05.110
it's not asynchronous. I see.
So, so there, there are

96
00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:11.080
like real time relied upon
maybe older, but totally people

97
00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.090
can count on them type
tools. And then there are

98
00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:17.710
more, I don't know, hacked,
hacked up tools that might

99
00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.980
give you extra information and
extra power, but people know

100
00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:24.130
not to rely on them.
Yeah. And also there's a,

101
00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:29.860
there are worries about standards
and what you're asking people

102
00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:33.430
to use because you can't,
how can I say this

103
00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:39.250
politely when people are under
duress, they like to create

104
00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:42.040
something make when your world
has been turned upside down,

105
00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.920
you usually use whatever skillset
you have in order to

106
00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:49.420
gain some sense of control.
When you have geeks building

107
00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:52.810
tools and people who are
really good at getting the

108
00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:55.780
word out, you can create
a whole lot more chaos

109
00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:00.700
in what is already a
desperate situation. And so one

110
00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.820
of the things that keeps
without bounds does is kind

111
00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:08.320
of play buffer between people
who have incredible talent and

112
00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.620
could really build some things
that will change the way

113
00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:14.110
we do response and the
way we live our live,

114
00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:18.760
our lives, but that they
need to curated a little

115
00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.860
bit more before they put
it out into the wild.

116
00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:24.220
I see. So yeah, I
like that. You're, you're a

117
00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:28.360
buffer. You provide focus and
program management and you know,

118
00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.940
something tragic has happened and
I really want to help.

119
00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:33.070
And I really know that
I can help out, but

120
00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:35.380
I, I would make it
worse if I just jumped

121
00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:39.730
in. Right. And the hands
are like extra hands are

122
00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:43.450
always useful. And that's one
of the reasons that a

123
00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:45.730
platform like Matt mill was
so great is it gave

124
00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:48.700
an outlet for that desire
to help people will show

125
00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:53.710
up regardless. And it's important
to, as my friend Matt

126
00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:57.910
says, designed for the messiness,
it's going to be chaotic.

127
00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:00.070
You have to figure that
out, figure out how, and

128
00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:02.980
it's, it's disrespectful for people
who show up and want

129
00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:07.060
to help out to tell
them no, go home. But

130
00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:10.720
yeah. Is, is the, the
number one thing when thinking

131
00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:15.250
about things in terms of
crisis response mapping, is this

132
00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:18.730
all mostly GIS type stuff,
geo look, you know, geolocation

133
00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:21.280
and geographic data is that,
that seems like that would

134
00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:22.870
be the thing that would
be the most important. When

135
00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:27.220
you think about crisis response,
It's a really big deal.

136
00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:34.750
You also, it also in
that it ties to volunteer

137
00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:38.770
dispatch and resource management, because
you need to know where

138
00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:42.460
your resources are going. One
of the things that that

139
00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:46.150
occupy Sandy did really, really
well was instead of trying

140
00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:49.570
to recreate entire resource management
structures. And how do you

141
00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:54.370
deal with incoming donation requests
and people bringing things and

142
00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:57.780
everything else, and just used
Amazon gift registry for weddings.

143
00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:02.760
And that was a really
awesome established tool that got

144
00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:05.540
deployed in a really neat
way. Yeah. That is an

145
00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:08.780
interesting idea though, that you
said that people want to

146
00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:11.660
make stuff when they're stressed
out. I mean, they want

147
00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:15.400
to make stuff, change stuff,
control stuff like, like, like

148
00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:17.210
a couple of days ago
I was really stressed out

149
00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.610
and I did two things.
I cleaned my office and

150
00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:22.190
I got a haircut that
didn't neither of those things

151
00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:26.480
move the crisis forward. And
I sure felt better afterwards,

152
00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:33.530
but when putting together a
project for a crisis, you

153
00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:36.470
know, like you could take
something like Google calendar, Google

154
00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:40.130
docs, and make a realtime
collaborative collaboration system that might

155
00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:44.660
be Nick less than polished,
but certainly would work. And

156
00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:47.720
they're totally reliable tools on
an infrastructure you can count

157
00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:51.980
on. Yeah, that was, that
was exactly what occupy Sandy

158
00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:55.040
had started to do is
they were using Google spreadsheets

159
00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:58.100
and Google maps and then
move to Google fusion tables

160
00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:00.860
to update their website automatically.
And then they move to

161
00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:04.130
a more specific platform, which
is called sauna Eden. That's

162
00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:08.480
an open source, a really
cool specific to disaster and,

163
00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:13.700
and humanitarian response. But they,
they were incredible, like the

164
00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:16.310
amount of, of chaos that
was going on in those

165
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:20.180
spaces and that they were
using their community organizing skill

166
00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:24.680
set to, to do response
was, yeah, it was great.

167
00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:28.430
What other organizations do you
work with? Like I know

168
00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:31.610
that there is a platform,
I think it's called Ushahidi.

169
00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:36.740
Yeah. So UCI Hedy is,
it means to testify and

170
00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:44.300
it was initially used to
track election results in Uganda.

171
00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:48.950
I forget I'm a horrible
person for not knowing specifically

172
00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:51.650
where, Right. It's, it's why
he leave for testimony. And

173
00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:57.470
it was used in the
2007 Kenyan election, as I

174
00:10:57.470 --> 00:11:01.250
recall. Yeah. Yes. There we
go. Thank you. And they,

175
00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:05.090
they are great. And that
gets used. That was used

176
00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:08.480
also in, in Sandy. And
it's, it's pretty diverse in

177
00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.520
how it can be used.
There's also a group that's

178
00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:16.220
rebuilt parts of it called
Tarifa, which does a, it's

179
00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:19.370
more like three, three, one,
one for slums of what's

180
00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:22.400
going on in your area.
And it's less in the

181
00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:26.870
moment based and more longterm
systemic. How are we fixing

182
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:31.820
things? And how many of
these kinds of different projects

183
00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:35.060
exist? I mean, if they're
mapping and they're trying to

184
00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:38.510
track response and keep track
of, of comments and how

185
00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:42.110
we can help and activists,
activism, I mean, there's activism

186
00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:45.200
and news organization. And on
one side of the spectrum,

187
00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.810
and on the other side,
there's more traditional kind of

188
00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:51.230
response. How many different platforms
are there and do you

189
00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:54.730
guys compete and, or you
all just use whatever software

190
00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:59.280
you can. There are a
lot of platforms. The issue

191
00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:03.360
is if it, what sort
of support exists for them

192
00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:05.730
as, as is often the
case in an open source

193
00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:08.820
communities of we'll share, there
are lots of little tools,

194
00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:12.030
but what actually has the
documentation and people who can

195
00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:16.440
help you out and, and
everything else in general, people

196
00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:19.500
get along pretty well. And
we've done a good job

197
00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:22.560
of, of making it clear
that by helping each other,

198
00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:26.640
we're all better off. Sometimes
you still run into because

199
00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:29.430
none of us are in
it for money. There's always

200
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:32.730
a problem of who gets
recognized for what, but that's

201
00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:37.080
the case in anything. And
we're working on repositories of

202
00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:41.580
these tools code for America
has a great, great repo

203
00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:43.740
of just a bunch of
different platforms that people have

204
00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:48.690
built out and random acts
of kindness are H O

205
00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:54.420
k.org is, has done a
good job of collecting challenges

206
00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:58.950
that people who do response
feel they face. When, when

207
00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:02.580
I hear about these kinds
of things from, and forgive

208
00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:04.530
me, I'm speaking from the
point of view of someone

209
00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:06.900
who's worked in private industry
for, you know, in software

210
00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:11.580
for 20 years. And I
think about, I think about

211
00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:15.540
young people, I think about
people living out of backpacks.

212
00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:17.940
And I think this is
not for me. Like I

213
00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:19.680
can't, how can I get
involved? Right. I've got a

214
00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:21.690
house and I got a
mortgage and I got kids

215
00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:25.740
to take the school, help
me bridge the gap between

216
00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:31.740
what I perceive correctly or
incorrectly as young people, activism

217
00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:33.930
that, you know, I can't
just throw a Mac book

218
00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:35.820
air in a backpack and
take off and, and, and

219
00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:38.070
help this. I gotta, you
know, I gotta pay the

220
00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:42.030
mortgage. How do you and
other organizations and people who

221
00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:45.720
work in those organizations pay
the rent and survive and,

222
00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.420
and, and not just go
and work at a bank

223
00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:50.580
somewhere. You know what I
mean? Like I, why don't

224
00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:53.250
you just quit and go
work for a bank, help

225
00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:55.350
me, help me work through
those multiple questions that are

226
00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:57.720
right there so that I
can feel more like I

227
00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:59.550
could get involved. You know
what I'm saying? Cause this

228
00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:02.220
all seems very abstract. And
I'm assuming that the listener

229
00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:05.370
is also thinking, well, gosh,
good for them, but how

230
00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:09.060
can I help? Yeah. So
there are, there's a great

231
00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:13.290
organization called Benetech that has
a program called social coding

232
00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:16.620
for good, that links up
people who work at large

233
00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:23.820
organizations or corporations and, and
mostly open source platforms that

234
00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:25.740
could really use their help.
And they have a good

235
00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:29.250
focus also on humanitarian and
disaster response. And so they

236
00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:33.600
come in and help facilitate
a few hours and everybody

237
00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:37.050
applies their, their skillset that
they've developed and use every

238
00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:40.440
day in their, in their
corporate life. And they help

239
00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:44.220
out other other groups. And
everybody is better off because

240
00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:51.510
of that. As far as
being the, the traveling, the

241
00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:54.920
tech nomad, which is definitely
one of the tech nomad

242
00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:59.150
or post geographic, depending on
how you want to say

243
00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:02.570
it. Sure. I am certainly
in that category, you know,

244
00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:05.570
I'm the, the punk kid
with the blue hair that

245
00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:09.110
shows up with the, the
cross punk patches on my

246
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:11.660
vest, but I'm also the
only person wearing a tie

247
00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:14.720
at a military deployment. It,
my, my friends call it

248
00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:20.390
satire punk, but it's, it's
possible and it's a lovely

249
00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:23.810
life, but it's also very,
very different. The way we

250
00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:27.200
pay our bills is through
corporate sponsorship. I, right now

251
00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:31.160
we're also working on some
grants and we are contracted

252
00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.440
out sometimes to do events
for people. We did an

253
00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:36.890
event this past weekend called
everyone hacks in San Francisco,

254
00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:42.560
which was education focused, but
radically inclusive. And it was

255
00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:47.360
super fun and it was
requested by HP and PG

256
00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:50.590
and E. And so they,
they cover the costs and

257
00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:54.070
some of the organizational costs
as well. Okay. So for,

258
00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:56.590
for you, I mean, it
is, you are you and

259
00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:59.170
these different organizations, you're big,
big in the sense that

260
00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:02.590
you are formal nonprofits, we
can donate to you your

261
00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:05.950
five Oh one three CS,
right. Five Oh one C

262
00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:09.640
three. Yeah, totally. We will
totally take your money. And

263
00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:12.760
that's sometimes the best thing
you can do is, is

264
00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:15.190
give money. This is the
part that I suck at.

265
00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:18.130
That's why I'm glad Johnny
digs is on our side.

266
00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:24.490
And, but it, I think
it's guava.org forward slash sponsorship

267
00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:28.300
or something you can Without
bounds GW, ob.org, and then

268
00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:33.010
you can find it from
there. Yeah. And stuff, give

269
00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:35.890
us money. That's cool. If
you want to, or give

270
00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:39.040
us code, like give us
time. And that's always super,

271
00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:41.680
super useful. So this brings
up the kind of thing

272
00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:44.320
that I wanted to get
to, which is, I always

273
00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:46.390
get emails from people saying,
I want to get involved

274
00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:48.010
in open source and I
want to work on this.

275
00:16:48.010 --> 00:16:50.920
And inevitably I'll say, well,
you know, go find a

276
00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:54.910
project on GitHub and figure
something out. But I've always

277
00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:58.670
thought that combining charity with
open source is like the,

278
00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:01.570
the ideal and maybe charity,
maybe charities in the world,

279
00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:03.640
the right word. But I
mean that, the word charity,

280
00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:05.710
just in the sense of
not just giving back to

281
00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:09.880
your favorite object, relational mapper,
but you know, something that's

282
00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:13.780
more fundamental. Do you think
that, that if, if someone

283
00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:15.970
is listening and they maybe
they've been thinking about open

284
00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:19.090
source, or they've been thinking
about writing code for the,

285
00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:23.710
for the commons that, that,
that talking to an organization

286
00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:26.230
like yours is, is the
best is a way a

287
00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:28.150
good way to do that.
The combined both of their

288
00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:32.440
passions giving back and giving
back. Absolutely. I think that,

289
00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:35.650
that I that's wonderful and
not just in that, it's

290
00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:37.900
good for them and it's
good for those projects, but

291
00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:43.390
in that these projects get
deployed into developing areas and

292
00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:48.400
then get deployed into our
own government structures. And it's

293
00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:53.820
a really good vector for
basically infiltrating new ideas and

294
00:17:53.820 --> 00:18:01.770
ideals into very established and
sometimes struggling systemic problem areas

295
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.860
is how I will put
that politely. I, I recently,

296
00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:09.440
when one of my favorite
charities is this charity called

297
00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:12.710
the red pump project. And
while it's not a response

298
00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:15.950
based situation, like some of
the, some of the things

299
00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:19.370
that you work on, they
do HIV and AIDS awareness

300
00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:23.360
for, for women and girls.
And my friend lovey is

301
00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:26.030
one of the founders of
that. And she needed a

302
00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:30.020
programming. She needed a program
written. And I think we

303
00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:35.120
sat down for like two
hours and it completely changed

304
00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:37.490
how they work on stuff.
And all it was was

305
00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:40.760
something that pulled goo, you
know, their website, their blog,

306
00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:44.090
some content management system and
Google spreadsheets. And now it's

307
00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:47.660
saved her a hundred hours
and it took me two,

308
00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:51.320
but people say, how do
you meet them? How do

309
00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:52.910
you hook up with them?
Like, that would be ideal.

310
00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:56.960
Like take smart programmer, take
a organization that needs smart

311
00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:59.810
programmer. I've got two hours,
I've got five hours. I've

312
00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:02.000
got maybe eight hours. Like
I think any programmer could

313
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.480
take eight hours and find
that time. Yeah. But how

314
00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:08.270
do you have the dating
service for those two organizations?

315
00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:14.030
Yeah. Axons is speed dating
between hackers and, and, and

316
00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:17.510
the organizations they might help
is totally spot on. And

317
00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:20.480
one of the reasons that
your venture was, is as

318
00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:22.700
successful as it was, is
because you talked to her

319
00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:26.210
about what her needs were.
A lot of the time,

320
00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:29.450
people who are techie have
the answer before you've even

321
00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:34.130
asked the question and you
end up creating more noise,

322
00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:38.810
not refining the signal. And
so by sitting down and

323
00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:42.770
figuring out where technology actually
applies, we can't solve people

324
00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:46.640
problems with tech, but we
can ease the transaction. We

325
00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:49.190
can make it easier for
people to do good work.

326
00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:54.370
And yeah. So that's, so
go to a hackathon. That's

327
00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:56.210
a, that's one of the
things that you can do.

328
00:19:56.210 --> 00:19:59.450
You'll learn a whole lot.
You'll meet other people and

329
00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:02.960
they can be super fun.
And you'll, you'll find an

330
00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:05.780
organization that you might want
to go into every once

331
00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:07.760
in a while. It's, it's
a new kind of community

332
00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:10.190
service go in and, and
give some time, make sure

333
00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:13.520
all their network cables are
on kinked and everything else.

334
00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:15.710
And sit down with them
about an app that might

335
00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:18.710
work for them. Different kinds
of hackathons. Like I see

336
00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:21.980
hackathon sponsored by organizations. Like
there might be like Twilio,

337
00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:24.800
and it's a hackathon sponsored
by Twilio where they'll, you

338
00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:27.110
know, go and hack on
our product. I know that

339
00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:31.520
I think Couchbase had a
hackathon in Portland recently. Are

340
00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:37.580
there, are there charitable organization
or fast deployment of assistance

341
00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:42.980
based hackathons that I can
find? Absolutely. So I am

342
00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:46.310
doing one next weekend, not
this one upcoming, but the

343
00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:49.810
one after in Puerto Prince
Haiti with a group called

344
00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:54.910
digital democracy and we're focused
on gender based violence. So

345
00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:57.910
when there's a short code
that when someone is affected

346
00:20:57.910 --> 00:21:01.570
by gender based violence, usually
rape, they can call the

347
00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:04.480
short coat and they hear
a real person on the

348
00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:06.640
other end of the line,
who is helping them with

349
00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:11.290
where a doctor that will
understand is, or a counselor

350
00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:16.090
is where, where to get
legal, help, things like that.

351
00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:21.700
And what we're helping to
do is make an updatable

352
00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:24.490
map of where those resources
are because they always move

353
00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:29.380
around and close. We're working
on visualizing the data. So

354
00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:32.170
it's not just response, but
it can become a policy

355
00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:35.560
issue. And we're working on
handing it off to the

356
00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:38.620
local population. So making sure
that the code is in

357
00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:41.710
a recognizable format and that
it's all understood. We're not

358
00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:45.760
just parachuting in building something
and then leaving. And it

359
00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:49.900
will just deteriorate over time.
So there are things that

360
00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:53.440
are very specific like that.
There's also random hacks of

361
00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:57.580
kindness. Charity mentioned that's a
happens twice a year. We're

362
00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:01.960
on the same, their event
is when we onboard teams

363
00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:06.160
because we're partners with them.
And the one that happens

364
00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:09.130
the first weekend of June
will also be national day

365
00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:11.230
of civic hacking, which just
got announced on the white

366
00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:15.850
house blog, where I insisted
we have Oxford commas because

367
00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:20.100
I care And, and, and,
but bonus points for the,

368
00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:24.600
the geeks are understand why
Oxford commerce are empty. Thank

369
00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:28.950
you. I love debating about
that. And so that's going

370
00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:33.210
to be an seeing contributing
code as, as a civic

371
00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:36.810
service and the need to
be an engaged citizen, even

372
00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:40.170
if you're sitting behind a
computer screen all day. So

373
00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:42.990
there are specific ones like
that. There it's basically a

374
00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:46.680
hackathon is, is a gathering
of people around an objective.

375
00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:52.500
And sometimes the objective is
hanging on a Tropo platform

376
00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:55.560
or whatever, or it's an
at and T hackathon, which

377
00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:59.130
I helped out with some,
for a while. And yeah,

378
00:22:59.370 --> 00:23:01.350
that's a good time. I
mean, I'm looking at your

379
00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:05.670
website here. If people go
to GW, ob.org, and then

380
00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:09.510
click on, get involved, there's
some initial things about how

381
00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:12.690
you can help with geeks
without bounds advocate and local

382
00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:14.250
geek and things like that.
But if you scroll down,

383
00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:17.700
you have gone and created
a, you know, help beyond

384
00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:21.330
an event. And there's, there's
probably six, seven different other

385
00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:24.810
organizations and projects that people
can get involved with. So

386
00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:26.790
really it's just a matter
of the willpower at that

387
00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:28.920
point, right? I mean, if
you have a talent that

388
00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:31.710
you want to share, there's
really no, excuse. It's just

389
00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:38.070
seems like discovery is a
problem. Yeah. I know that.

390
00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:40.200
I also suffer from this
of just the assumption that

391
00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:42.330
if you do good work,
people will pay attention and

392
00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:46.820
noticed and learning how to
publicize. The things that we

393
00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:54.440
do is important and I'm
learning. But one of the

394
00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:56.720
things that we do is
try to advocate for other

395
00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:58.760
projects that are going on
and see if people want

396
00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:03.010
to sign on to them.
Yeah. Getting involved is, is,

397
00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:07.450
is a problem because it's
hurting, it's hurting cats. Right.

398
00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:14.890
And that geeks, sorry, go
ahead. The they're funneling kittens,

399
00:24:15.130 --> 00:24:18.640
Funneling kittens. Herding cats. Yes,
exactly. I mean, it's like,

400
00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:22.120
That's another reason to go
to an event because it's,

401
00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:25.480
it's super low barrier to
entry. They usually feed you.

402
00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:28.270
There are people there that
will answer your questions directly

403
00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:32.050
and they, they help structure
your efforts. And if you

404
00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:35.530
continue on, that's why you
are a champ. And if

405
00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:38.470
you don't, it's okay. You've
learned something. And so has

406
00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:41.170
everyone else. One of the
things that I think is

407
00:24:41.170 --> 00:24:43.270
really impressive about what you
guys are doing is if

408
00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:46.810
you go and click on
sponsorship and click on transparent

409
00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:49.510
accounting, and you don't always
see this, this is using

410
00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:52.630
dig up the accounting for
an organization, but you've actually

411
00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:55.870
got your Google spreadsheet kind
of embedded in the page

412
00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:59.590
here. And it's like, look,
there's your salary, right? It's

413
00:24:59.590 --> 00:25:03.100
like, I have to update
that for a 2013. I

414
00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:05.980
think I need to embed
2013 instead of No, it

415
00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:10.360
says, it says 2013. Yes.
Victory victory on top of

416
00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:12.850
it. I just think that's
very impressive because I think

417
00:25:12.850 --> 00:25:15.430
that you're, you're a point
I'm hearing a couple of

418
00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:18.520
points give money, right? Like
the easiest possible thing you

419
00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:20.770
can do is throw money
at the problem. And you

420
00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:22.480
guys will figure out the
right way to use the

421
00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:25.960
money. But often people will
say, well, you know, if

422
00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:27.370
I gave this much, if
I got, if I give

423
00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:30.400
a hundred dollars and only
$3 is going to end

424
00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:32.380
up on the ground, well,
I mean, here, you've actually

425
00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:35.410
got truly transparent accounting. You
can see your salary, you

426
00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:37.570
can see what you gave
the money, how much the

427
00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:41.170
about page costs. That is
really cool. Like I think

428
00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:46.450
every geek based charitable organization
should do that. Like Holy

429
00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:48.760
crap, they put the master
budget in a Google spreadsheet

430
00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:52.540
that everyone can view. You
know, that's Epic. I love

431
00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:55.330
that. Like even have like
a line here for how

432
00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:58.900
much you spent on swag.
That's exactly how it should

433
00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:01.060
be done. So that makes
me feel more comfortable about

434
00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:04.470
giving to an organization like
yours, but right. It's, it's

435
00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:08.830
important that we are held
accountable. There's a, there's a

436
00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:14.050
dearth of, of what are
considered charitable organizations that don't

437
00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:18.730
use their funding. Well, and
initially making the budget transparent

438
00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:22.000
was, was a selfish act
because I am new to

439
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.790
this. And I want to
be sure that if anyone

440
00:26:24.790 --> 00:26:26.740
is, is supporting us, they
have a chance to be

441
00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:29.890
like, are you sure you're
doing this efficiently? Have you

442
00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:33.460
thought about this thing over
here? And it's yeah. It's

443
00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:35.560
something that I want to
see, see all over the

444
00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:39.790
place. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Now
the random hacks of kindness

445
00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:42.040
section on your site and
also the website, it's still

446
00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:44.640
say 2012. Are there going
to be random acts of

447
00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:48.620
kindness in 2013? Absolutely. There
will be one if they

448
00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:51.050
happen the first weekend of
June and the first weekend

449
00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:55.670
of December and that it's
consistent, that's been that way

450
00:26:55.670 --> 00:26:57.830
for the past few years.
Okay, cool. So the dates

451
00:26:57.830 --> 00:27:00.050
are just the, the day,
the month is the same.

452
00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:02.240
The year is just to,
it's a matter of like

453
00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:04.460
always writing the wrong number
on the check. I always

454
00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:10.670
write 2012 for several years
after 2012 is over. This

455
00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:12.830
sounds very exciting. And I
think that I can, I

456
00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:15.170
feel like I could point
people now at these different

457
00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:17.750
websites and organizations and they
could feel like they could

458
00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:19.850
get involved. They can, they
can get on your schedule.

459
00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:23.780
They can, they can give
money. They can say, I

460
00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:26.300
have these skills. Can you
help me line these skills

461
00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:30.260
up with, with an organization
or a response that might

462
00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:33.060
nest might need it? Do
you have some examples of,

463
00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:35.660
of, of a response or
a time when some geek

464
00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:41.030
skills really made a difference?
Absolutely. So there's a, there

465
00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:44.690
was a hackathon that happened
in Florida that generated a

466
00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:48.980
thing called tweet three PO
I don't know, I don't

467
00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:51.410
know what it is, but
it sounds awesome. So it

468
00:27:51.410 --> 00:27:56.630
was because the local police
had opened up their feed,

469
00:27:57.140 --> 00:28:01.790
their blotter, not for violent
crimes, because those are sensitive,

470
00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:04.490
right? You don't want to
say where you're pursuing someone,

471
00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:07.820
but there's a tree down
or there's a street closed.

472
00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:11.510
Or there was a break
in a few days later

473
00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:16.400
or whatever, it's classified by
neighborhood. And so you can

474
00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:21.410
see what's going on where,
and you can subscribe to

475
00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:25.370
the Twitter feed of your
neighborhood. So there was a

476
00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:28.010
break in, in, and this
apartment and it ended up

477
00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:30.920
that there had also been
some violence associated with it.

478
00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:35.060
And because people were subscribed
to this Twitter feed, they

479
00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:38.390
saw a person that was
acting very strangely and they

480
00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:41.180
were on the lookout for
it. And so they were

481
00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:45.980
able to better find that
person and, and bring them

482
00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:52.370
to justice as it were.
And that's something that digs

483
00:28:52.370 --> 00:28:55.880
can, can say moron. I,
because he was a, he

484
00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:59.960
was there also, but it's
interesting to me as a

485
00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:04.250
way of being more socially
involved and, and in a

486
00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:08.330
way that has camaraderie, that
you can loop people in

487
00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:10.910
and be welcoming on the
same platform that allowed people

488
00:29:10.910 --> 00:29:17.870
to call shenanigans. Yeah. I
think really location, location based

489
00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:23.870
information is where, where the
idea of like, there's something

490
00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:26.030
has occurred and I could
help or something has occurred.

491
00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:29.360
And I could take action.
I know that a couple

492
00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:32.330
of months ago, so totally
random, but a couple of

493
00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:36.670
months ago, someone crashed their
car into a power, a

494
00:29:36.810 --> 00:29:40.460
power pole or whatever, knocked
it down. And all the

495
00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:42.730
neighbors were, and, you know,
they're all like walking around

496
00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:45.190
the street, like what's going
on? What happened? I went

497
00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:49.390
onto Twitter and clicked on
search nearby tweets. And it's

498
00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:51.610
like, Oh, what guy ran
his car into the thing,

499
00:29:51.910 --> 00:29:54.280
you know? And it's suddenly
the, the, the idea, like

500
00:29:54.290 --> 00:29:56.500
I could look at my
Twitter feed or I could

501
00:29:56.500 --> 00:30:00.100
subscribe to some local, random
person, but that's not really

502
00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:02.080
feasible. I'm not going to
be able to sort signal

503
00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:05.530
from noise. But when I
clicked on nearby tweets, which

504
00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:08.350
then took all the geo
tagged tweets and put them

505
00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:10.360
into a map, I was
like, Oh, this person looks

506
00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:12.670
like they're near the problem
click. Oh, it looks like

507
00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:16.330
someone crashed when you apply
that to more interesting things

508
00:30:16.330 --> 00:30:20.980
like police response, disaster response,
you know, someone has broken

509
00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:23.500
into the plaid pantry down
the street or the seven

510
00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:26.290
11 and they're running North.
Oh, wow. Look, I can,

511
00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:29.620
I can take action. I'm
right there. That, that becomes

512
00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:33.330
really, really powerful. There's a
really great group called humanity

513
00:30:33.330 --> 00:30:35.400
road that does a lot
of that. They do a,

514
00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:38.490
they watch for tweets in
an area and respond to

515
00:30:38.490 --> 00:30:42.510
people directly when people are
tweeting that their phone isn't

516
00:30:42.510 --> 00:30:46.050
working, they're saying a lot
of people are using their

517
00:30:46.050 --> 00:30:48.660
phone. And so you're not
going to get the bandwidth.

518
00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:51.600
You need to, to be
able to, to make a

519
00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:55.020
call and so send a,
send a text and that

520
00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:57.420
sort of thing. And it
just, it's people helping people.

521
00:30:57.420 --> 00:30:59.850
And it's wonderful. Yeah. And
I think also from a

522
00:30:59.850 --> 00:31:02.280
geek perspective, getting to work
on tech that they may

523
00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:07.770
have written off, like SMS
is hugely useful thing. And

524
00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:11.730
sending out alert based or
informational SMS is over a

525
00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:15.630
blanket area that has to
do with geo located specific

526
00:31:15.630 --> 00:31:18.930
information with, with regard to
either something like you mentioned

527
00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:22.860
violence in an area, or
whether it be election results

528
00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:25.650
or whether it be disaster
response, there's more than just

529
00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:29.940
email and Twitter and, and
things like that. Getting involved

530
00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:31.800
in all those multiple channels,
I think is really exciting.

531
00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:34.350
Well, thanks so much for,
for chatting with me today.

532
00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:37.950
Thanks for having me. Folks
can go up to geeks

533
00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:41.820
without bounds GW, ob.org, click
on, get involved. You can

534
00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:46.530
see right there, they're embedded
Google spreadsheet with their transparent

535
00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:50.100
accounting. You can donate money.
You can get on willows,

536
00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:53.160
extremely busy schedule. And also,
I think you've got your,

537
00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:55.620
some of your responsibilities are
transferred over to someone named

538
00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:58.920
Lindsay right now. Yeah. Sorry.
I'm going to go to,

539
00:31:59.430 --> 00:32:02.310
to Boston to do research
with the center for civic

540
00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:05.430
media out of MIT and
at Berkman center out of

541
00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:08.340
Harvard, if they'll have me.
And so Lindsey is taking

542
00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:10.680
on a lot of the
day to day interactions. That's

543
00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:13.020
very exciting. Well, that's great.
Well, I'll also put your

544
00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:15.510
Twitter account that people can
follow you and see your

545
00:32:15.510 --> 00:32:19.230
adventures and also follow. You
said digs and Lindsey from

546
00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:22.210
Kiko that bounce and get
involved. Thank you so much.

547
00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:26.070
This has been another episode
of Hanselminutes and we'll see

548
00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:27.030
you again next week.
