<inaudible> from hanselminutes.com. It's Hansel
minutes, a weekly discussion with

9
00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.720
web developer and technologist Scott
Hanselman. This is Lawrence Ryan announcing

10
00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.110
show number four 47. In
this episode, Scott talks with

11
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.760
musician, artists, and inventor Moldova
about exploring new frontiers in

12
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:51.200
electronic music. <inaudible>. Hi, this
is Scott Hanselman. This is

13
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.050
another episode of Hansel minutes,
and I'm talking with Moldova,

14
00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.390
who is a musician, an
artist, and an inventor from

15
00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.090
the Bay area who I
met over in Stockholm, Sweden.

16
00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.280
How's it going? Nice gardens.
It's going well. Good to

17
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.320
be here. I really appreciate
you chatting with me today.

18
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.450
You've got a really, really
diverse background. You've got a

19
00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.670
lot of stuff going on,
but I wanted to talk

20
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.730
to you about this idea
of controller ism and explain

21
00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:13.100
to people who have never
heard that word before. What

22
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.650
does that mean? Controller ism?
Oh, this is a word

23
00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.330
I started using back in
2007 when I was performing

24
00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.960
with a laptop and a
sort of hacked up keyboard

25
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.200
mini controller. And it was
just challenging to kind of

26
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.660
explain what I was doing
because a lot of custom

27
00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.730
software had this very customized
physical interface. And the music

28
00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.940
I was doing was, was
I'd like to think kind

29
00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.340
of ahead of his time.
So, you know, you can

30
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.430
either use an older way
to describe that, like I'm

31
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.700
doing live electronic music or
something like that, but I

32
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.310
thought I knew word was
just kind of a neat

33
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.330
way to pique people's interests
and the word I came

34
00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.400
up with to explain it
seemed to do a pretty

35
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.220
good job because there's a
lot of understanding, like DJ

36
00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.960
culture it'd become mainstream and
Everybody knows. I knew at

37
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.720
that time what DJs do
and the extension of that,

38
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.530
that is turntablism was also
super popular. So it just

39
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.950
kind of capitalizing on that
popular understanding of a term

40
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.310
to coin a new term
seemed like a great idea.

41
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.850
So I went for it.
Would you, would you not

42
00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.370
say in any way to
discount or turn or say

43
00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.580
that turntablism is a less
skillful, but when I saw

44
00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.920
you perform, I got the
impression that you were doing

45
00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.350
a lot of work. There
was, you know what I

46
00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.870
mean? I didn't feel like
it was a lot of

47
00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.520
work was done ahead of
time. Well, when I watch

48
00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.260
a DJ and a turntable,
I get a sense that

49
00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.500
perhaps they put together the
gig and they're kind of

50
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.980
there with their gig as
opposed to they are the

51
00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.300
gig and they brought the
gig with them. Yeah. Well,

52
00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.130
the performances I'm doing now
are a little removed from

53
00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.710
that. I've picked up the
guitar again since, and started

54
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:53.190
writing songs since. So my
performance style has changed from

55
00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.190
what it was when I,
when I coined that term.

56
00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.660
But, but yeah, it's true.
What I was doing then

57
00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.420
just like what I was
doing now was much more

58
00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.520
technically complex than what DJs
or turntablist do, but it

59
00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.840
was really more about just
like reaching an audience and,

60
00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.010
and also like encouraging other
people to do the same

61
00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.220
thing. Because every time I
would do a workshop or

62
00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.620
sit down with a friend
who was already a musician

63
00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.450
or already a DJ and
kind of show them the

64
00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.690
technology I was using, they
were just blown away. And

65
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.310
if I gave him the
opportunity to play it, they

66
00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.280
just had the most fun,
you know, they'd light up

67
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.500
like little kids. So a
lot of it was just

68
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.590
wanting to like spread the
ideas and grow the culture

69
00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.490
and build a community of
music makers who, you know,

70
00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.410
could do the same things
that I was doing. Just

71
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.420
to kind of, you know,
just to have people around

72
00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.550
before For this kind of
resurgence and excitement around electronic

73
00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.210
music, what would someone have
available to them? If I

74
00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.730
say today, I'm going to
enter the world of electronic

75
00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.760
music. I just buy a
mini keyboard and do some

76
00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.590
sampling. And that's the extent
of what I'm able to

77
00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:03.060
do. Well, there's cheese, there's
so much crazy stuff now.

78
00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.410
I mean, computer-based, I got
into electronic music, right? When

79
00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.970
things were moving quickly from
hardware, you know, like hardware

80
00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.150
rack mounts, and the sizers
are synthesizer, sampler keyboards and

81
00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.230
workstations and stuff like that
into computers where, where everything

82
00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:21.810
was kind of like virtual
copies of that. And then

83
00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.500
some, so I, I did
not go through a phase

84
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.950
of like buying old analog
keyboards and, you know, learning

85
00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:30.690
how to use a hardware
sampler. I had some bits

86
00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:32.820
of, of, of that gear,
but I was much more

87
00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.250
excited about the stuff that
my computer could do. I

88
00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:36.990
was really into computers. I've
been, you know, I had

89
00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.230
a computer in my, in
my home, like since growing

90
00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:42.630
up and I learned a
program. I was really in

91
00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.610
a game. So I was
just really comfortable with the

92
00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:49.350
whole computer world. And anyways,
geez, we're way past that

93
00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:53.040
now. So I mean, the
things you can do with

94
00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.760
a laptop, or even like
a tablet or a smartphone

95
00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:00.440
just surpass anything I was
doing at that time. And

96
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.640
it's become incredibly easy to,
you know, just connect all

97
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.730
these things and make music
happen. And I can't even

98
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.640
imagine I'm going to, I'm
going to, to, to Berkeley

99
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.590
college of music next week
in Boston, and it'll be

100
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:15.920
really interesting to see what,
what young people who are

101
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:19.750
coming up in electronic music
are doing Now, why are

102
00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:22.180
you, what did you feel
the need to make physical

103
00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:24.040
controllers? You, like you said,
you can do pretty much

104
00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:27.310
everything in software. Why isn't
just a regular keyboard enough.

105
00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.170
What is it about the
physicality and the making of

106
00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:32.470
your own controller? Yeah, that's
a great question. It's something

107
00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:36.790
you don't know unless you've
practiced a musical instrument or

108
00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:40.930
something similar in practicing and
learning a musical instrument, you

109
00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:44.170
do a lot of like
repetitive kind of things like

110
00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:47.080
learning your scales or whatever.
You, you repeat these motions

111
00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.660
over and over again with
your, with your muscles, with

112
00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:52.030
your hands or with your
voice or whatever. And that's

113
00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:57.100
what enables virtuosic performance. And
these really, really interesting and

114
00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:00.670
fun States of, of playing
music where you're not cognitively

115
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:04.000
thinking about moving your left
index finger from this string

116
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.520
to that string to play
the next note, but your

117
00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.720
muscles have been so well
trained that, that the, the

118
00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:13.360
music just kind of flows
through you and having that

119
00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.850
experience, you know, studying guitar
for a long time and

120
00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:18.520
a bunch of other instruments.
That's what I knew I

121
00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:21.010
wanted from a musical instrument.
So when I started playing

122
00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:26.380
with computers and, and, and
mini controllers, it quickly became

123
00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:32.440
apparent that there really weren't
any good affordable mini controllers

124
00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:35.530
to interact with the software
that I had. And there

125
00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:39.130
wasn't anything, you know, there,
there, there were some very

126
00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:43.390
esoteric, specialized instruments. Like you
could get multitouch services, you

127
00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:46.750
know, back in like 2002,
but, but they were super

128
00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:49.120
expensive and they were kind
of one trick ponies. You

129
00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.520
know, you could spend your,
your whole allowance on one

130
00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.020
of those things, and you'd
only be able to do

131
00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:55.300
one thing. So to me,
there was, there was no

132
00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:58.540
instrument that came anywhere close
to the maturity of, of

133
00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:01.210
what a guitar or keyboard
or a drum kit is.

134
00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:03.970
And so I decided that
I needed to create that

135
00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:07.390
Was the, was the robo
caster. One of your first,

136
00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:11.080
this is your controller slash
guitar is an electric guitar.

137
00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:14.380
And you integrated a custom
controller inside of that. Was

138
00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:16.960
that one of your first
or No, the, the robo

139
00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:19.270
cast or guitar is actually
one of the most recent

140
00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:23.050
as a funny thing. I
just kinda, I just kinda

141
00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:25.090
did a one 80. I
was playing in a bunch

142
00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:27.430
of bands. You know, I
was a guitarist. I was

143
00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:30.850
leading my own band vocalist
and guitarist and doing all

144
00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:33.730
this much more traditional musician
kind of stuff. And I

145
00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:37.810
just kinda got fed up
with all the, the drama

146
00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:40.480
that can result from, from
being in bands and that

147
00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:44.650
kind of situation. And I
just, just left all that.

148
00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:46.610
And so I put the
guitar away for several years,

149
00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:49.060
actually didn't play for like
a long, long time and

150
00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:51.880
was just playing these controllers
because there really was a

151
00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:54.400
lot of work at the
time I was doing it,

152
00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:57.180
you know, to these things
behave. There was there's great

153
00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:00.270
software out there, but it
wasn't anywhere near as mature

154
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:02.900
as it is now. So
you kind of had to

155
00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:07.710
roll your own software, so
to speak with these, these

156
00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:10.860
like higher level object oriented
languages that we use, like

157
00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:14.220
reactor and max MSP, you
know, they're not exactly like

158
00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.410
coding, but they're ways that
you can design your own

159
00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:20.640
software instruments. So, you know,
just getting over that hurdle

160
00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.730
and getting a physical interface
to work with that thing

161
00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:27.330
and learning all the principles
of like instrument design, you

162
00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:34.050
know, ergonomics and, and ah,
jeez there's yeah. Tactile feedback

163
00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:36.810
and, and, and all that
kind of stuff. So I

164
00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:39.420
had my hands full with
the controllers and integrating it

165
00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:42.480
now with the guitar and
with the voice is, is

166
00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.080
a, is, is a more
recent, I think you may

167
00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:47.840
have actually just indirectly answered
the next question I was

168
00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:49.850
going to ask you, cause
you just said tactile feedback.

169
00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:52.160
And I believe when I
saw you in Sweden, you

170
00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.070
were using the mojo or
a version of the mojo,

171
00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:56.720
which is the kind of
a, it looks like a

172
00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.970
box with a whole bunch
of arcade buttons on it,

173
00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:02.030
but it has more than
just buttons. It's got sliders

174
00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:05.120
and knobs. There's a, there's
a, there's a kinetic newness

175
00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:08.240
to the controller. My question
was going to be, why

176
00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.610
didn't you just use a
big iPad? Is it the

177
00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:14.210
physicality of the switches? That,
Yeah, number one is, is

178
00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:17.360
there was no iPad. There's
a $3,000 device called a

179
00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:21.740
lemur, which did the multitouch
stuff that iPad does. But

180
00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:23.600
I even borrowed one of
those and set those up,

181
00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:25.340
set that up to do
the things I was doing

182
00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:28.370
with the mojo. And it
just falls flat because there's

183
00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:31.370
no tactile feedback. You can't
learn it by muscle memory.

184
00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:33.410
So you can never get
to a virtuoso level of

185
00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:36.830
performance. And if you see
people performing with an iPad,

186
00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:39.650
now you have this sign.
It's the same effect that

187
00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:42.560
you had back at the
laptop days. You know, you'd

188
00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:46.940
see people on stage quote,
unquote, checking their email, which

189
00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:50.120
is, which was kind of
the performance aesthetic. I was

190
00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:53.210
like railing against trying to
change. That's. I mean, I,

191
00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:56.270
I haven't seen a real
pro DJ, but I've seen

192
00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:58.100
a number of DJs where
it's like, really? Are you

193
00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:05.150
texting right now? Yeah, well,
yeah. I mean like deejaying

194
00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:08.240
is one thing, but you
know, seeing, seeing what's build

195
00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:10.280
is like a live performance
and then it really just

196
00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:13.340
being somebody behind a laptop,
I found that really frustrating.

197
00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:15.470
And you kind of wind
up doing the same thing.

198
00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:18.500
Now, if you have an
iPad, not because of an

199
00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:22.310
aesthetic choice or anything, but
because the device requires you

200
00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:24.020
to look at it so
you can see what you

201
00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:27.230
button your fingers on top
of. So it's, you know,

202
00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:31.760
the, the, the tablets are
really useful interfaces for, for

203
00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:35.120
computers and for producing music,
all these other musical activities,

204
00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.820
you know, they're great for,
but for like live performance,

205
00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:41.480
you know, the actual expression,
the connection between human and

206
00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:45.560
machine, they're not that great.
So people will be able

207
00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:46.880
to go up and look
at the show notes and

208
00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:48.890
see a picture of the
mojo and also see video

209
00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:50.600
of you using it. But
one of the things I

210
00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:53.120
noticed with it, wasn't just
a box with some buttons.

211
00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:56.680
If I understand from watching
you, you had buttons mounted

212
00:11:56.680 --> 00:12:00.580
around like a donut around
your, your microphone. I think

213
00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:03.850
you might've had foot pedals.
You were basically everywhere at

214
00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:07.840
all times, different interfaces. How
many different pieces are involved

215
00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:10.710
in a live performance like
that? Well, the, the show

216
00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:12.990
I'm doing now is only,
it's only three pieces of

217
00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:15.570
gear. So there's the mojo
which you described really well,

218
00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:19.380
that just controls the playback
and manipulation of sounds from

219
00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:22.320
my computers. So that's kind
of like, you know, conducting

220
00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:25.620
the orchestra or queuing and
arranging the band. If you

221
00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:29.340
will, I've got the rebel
caster guitar where I play,

222
00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:33.420
you know, lead guitar parts
and, and kind of modify

223
00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:35.820
those with the controls on
the guitar. So that's kind

224
00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:38.280
of like actually having the
pedal board built into the

225
00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.110
face of the guitar, which
you can do some really

226
00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:43.350
interesting things with. And then
the thing you're describing the,

227
00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:47.010
that was attached to my
microphone. That's a prototype of

228
00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:48.870
an instrument. I don't have
a name for, it's just

229
00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:52.110
the microphone controller. And it's
kinda, it's growing out of

230
00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:55.260
the same world of the
robo caster where it's like,

231
00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:57.570
Oh, what can I do
to augment? You know, I've

232
00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:00.180
learned the guitar really well.
Like what can I do

233
00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:05.010
with this kind of controller
building idea to augment what

234
00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:06.750
I do with guitar? And
I'm doing the same thing

235
00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:09.570
with voice as well. And
so you saw a prototype,

236
00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:12.030
this is like a giant
clip with a bunch of

237
00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:14.850
arcade buttons on it. And
the next one is going

238
00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:18.300
to look like probably kind
of like a trumpet, but

239
00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:22.530
smaller. That's pretty it's. So
it worked really well. I

240
00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:24.630
mean, it gave you, it
gave a sense of, of,

241
00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:27.630
of a modern day, one
band, more one man band.

242
00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:29.940
Like they, you were up
there and you're on the

243
00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:33.360
tight rope and there's no
net. And I think that

244
00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.860
that's the, the sense of
like, what's he going to

245
00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:37.320
do next? He could make
a mistake. Whoa, did he

246
00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:40.560
just do that? As opposed
to the, Oh, he set

247
00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:43.740
this playlist up before he
got here? Yeah. That's the

248
00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:46.590
key. One of the key
elements of live music performance

249
00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:51.600
is the, the risk. There's
really nothing live. And there's

250
00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:53.940
nothing exciting about it for
me as a performer or

251
00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:56.610
as an audience watching, I
think if there's no possibility

252
00:13:56.610 --> 00:13:58.980
of something going wrong and
if nothing goes wrong for

253
00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:03.480
an entire show, you know,
I feel kind of unsatisfied

254
00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:06.120
because as an audience member
for other people's shows, those

255
00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:08.820
are my favorite parts. You
know, when there's like, you

256
00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:12.840
know, the guy gets ready
to play and there's no

257
00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:14.670
nothing's coming out of the
microphone, you know? And they

258
00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:16.380
spent, he hasn't to the
first three minutes of this

259
00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:20.370
show, like, you know, troubleshooting
something. Those are, you know,

260
00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:22.570
in the past I've seen
people do that and always

261
00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:24.660
been really entertained by it.
And people come to me

262
00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:26.730
after my shows and are
often like, Oh man, that

263
00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:29.490
was really cool when like,
you know, that one mic

264
00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:31.320
stopped working. So you ran
over to the mic from

265
00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:34.170
the next band and started
using that one or whatever.

266
00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:38.820
So yeah, risk risk is
part of live music. And

267
00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:41.040
I build a certain amount
of risk. There's a certain

268
00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:42.870
amount of control to, you
know, cause you want to

269
00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:46.110
have some, something you can
rely on some, some, some

270
00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:50.510
sort of confident structure you
can lean back on and

271
00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:53.150
know that you'll, you're kind
of sound good if, if

272
00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:56.150
you have a cold that
night or just had a

273
00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:58.400
fight with your girlfriend or
whatever, you know, it's, it's

274
00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:04.750
cool to not have too
much risk. So It's interesting

275
00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:07.720
that you, you you've mentioned
risks so much because the,

276
00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:10.810
if I understand correctly, and
again, I'm just learning about

277
00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:13.450
this world, but the non
risky thing for you to

278
00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:17.080
do would be to buy
controllers, go to native instruments,

279
00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:19.420
go to Denon, spend a
lot of money, go to

280
00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:23.350
new market industries, spend big
money, 50, 60 grand worth

281
00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:25.960
of equipment. And now you're
a person who's bought his

282
00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:30.130
iron man armor. Except you
built your Ironman armor yourself.

283
00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:35.320
Yeah. Well, I still buy
instruments, you know, like for

284
00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:38.650
studio production, I just got
a pair of new great.

285
00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:42.520
Yeah, yeah. And then yeah.
All kinds of stuff, but

286
00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:45.940
this is part of my
arsenal, but, but there's something,

287
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.040
I don't know, it's, it's
kind of this, this, this

288
00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:50.230
path that I've gone in
and it gives a lot

289
00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:53.410
of character to my shows.
And for a minute it

290
00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:55.110
felt like a novelty thing,
you know, and it would

291
00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:56.950
just be like, Oh, people
would always be talking more

292
00:15:56.950 --> 00:16:00.040
about my gear than, than
about my music, but I

293
00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:02.260
think it's come around full
circle where I just kinda

294
00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:06.910
had to kind of own
the technology figuratively speaking, you

295
00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:10.060
know, to wear these instruments,
you know, I've been playing

296
00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:12.910
the mojo for, I don't
know, like, like six years

297
00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:14.860
now. So it used to
be like, yes, I've played

298
00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:18.460
guitar for like 15 and
this feels like an extension

299
00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:20.470
of my body. But you
know, this box full of

300
00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:24.340
buttons and stuff feels a
little strange, but now I'm,

301
00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:27.970
I'm just as comfortable with
it. And, and I think

302
00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:30.460
that that's the magical part
is when you can have

303
00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:33.580
all this wacky technology things,
people for likely not seen

304
00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:36.370
before, but you can use
it in a way that

305
00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:41.020
makes it seem effortless and,
you know, to an observer,

306
00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:44.590
it's just, it's just kind
of magical, you know, humans

307
00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:48.430
using tools to extend their
creative output. One of the

308
00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:50.890
things that I think is
unique about you and as

309
00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:53.050
I've been wandering around doing
research and trying to understand

310
00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:54.910
what you do and why
you do it is that

311
00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:57.580
you're not keeping this to
yourself. You're not only giving

312
00:16:57.580 --> 00:16:59.080
the music out there. You're
putting the music out and

313
00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:00.730
you putting yourself out there,
but you've actually put the

314
00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:03.580
design, the design of the
mojo controller and made it

315
00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:05.980
open source. People could potentially,
if they knew what they

316
00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:09.640
were doing, make one. Yeah.
Well, I mean, that's, I've

317
00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:12.490
benefited so much from information
that other people have shared

318
00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:15.910
and that's the thing that
makes the internet great. It's

319
00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:19.570
a delicate balance because you
can't just give away, you

320
00:17:19.570 --> 00:17:22.900
know, the product of all
your labor for free, or

321
00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:27.370
are you gonna make a
living, but whenever possible, I

322
00:17:27.370 --> 00:17:29.740
try to give stuff away.
And definitely, you know, when

323
00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:33.730
like, I've, you know, if
it doesn't have use to

324
00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:37.410
me, I see no reason
to hide the secret and

325
00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:39.370
really early on, I think
I got a good lesson

326
00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:42.670
because, because even before I
came up with the word

327
00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:45.940
controller ism, you know, I
just had this challenge of

328
00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:49.530
like helping audiences and, and
even like, you know, and

329
00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:52.410
fans like understand the technology
I'm using and having to

330
00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:54.750
do that kind of explaining
is what drove me to,

331
00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:57.270
to make videos. And I
have a lot of YouTube

332
00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:59.370
content and people more frequently
are like, Oh, I've seen

333
00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:03.840
your videos then, Oh, I
heard your record. And they're

334
00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:06.390
not talking about music videos.
They're talking about some weird

335
00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:09.240
video where I'm like, Hey,
let's check out these instruments.

336
00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:11.490
I invented. Here's how I
made them. Here's a website

337
00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:13.680
where you can download all
the plans, you know, here

338
00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:17.220
are, watch me make one
and super fast forward time-lapse.

339
00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:20.370
So, you know, I, I
like doing that stuff. I

340
00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:24.390
think, I think it, it
combines what I think is

341
00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:27.990
one of the most noble
professions, which is teaching, which

342
00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:32.040
is a very, you know,
humanitarian, like serving, serving others

343
00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:34.710
kind of thing, which something
with something that can feel

344
00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:38.100
a little more self-serving, which
is performing and composing and

345
00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:40.520
being a solo artist. Yeah.
There's definitely, it seems that

346
00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:42.170
the kind of stuff that
I would want to see

347
00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:43.850
at maker fair, you know,
I was just at the

348
00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:47.090
maker fair here in Portland
with my kids and all

349
00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:50.510
of your stuff, all your
projects fit, fit Right in

350
00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:53.840
yeah. Maker, fairs. Amazing. I've
been to the Bay area

351
00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:55.460
one a few times and
I was in the New York

352
00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:58.040
at the New York maker fair
two years ago. And that's,

353
00:18:58.210 --> 00:19:00.290
that's a really great culture.
I love, I love that.

354
00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:02.690
And I support it whenever
I can. So just last

355
00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:07.190
year you had a successful
Kickstarter and you're working on

356
00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:09.290
that. And while you're, while
you're gigging and doing your

357
00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:12.590
a million other things that
you're doing, the thing that's

358
00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:15.440
so great about your Kickstarter
that really caught my eye

359
00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:19.610
is that it it's a
circuit board instrument that is

360
00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:22.040
effectively in the package of
a tape of like a

361
00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:23.990
tape deck, like a, like
an old cause I an

362
00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:26.240
old, you know, I'm old,
like I said, it's like

363
00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:28.310
a cassette tape. It's like
awesome mix number one. It's

364
00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:30.950
guardians of the galaxy. It's
this amazing instrument all in

365
00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:34.340
the size of, you know,
credit card sized. Yeah. Well,

366
00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:36.380
I, I did the, it's
kind of the second iteration

367
00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:38.990
of a album artwork idea
that executed with my last

368
00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:41.300
album. It was my last
album. I actually put out

369
00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:45.050
physical media, it was on
CD. And I got this

370
00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:47.510
idea from a friend who
had made business cards at

371
00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:50.870
a circuit boards to make
CDR work at a circuit

372
00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:53.570
board. So I did that
and it was virally successful.

373
00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:55.970
I got, you know, hundreds
of thousands of hits on

374
00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:59.900
this video and, and sold,
you know, way, way more,

375
00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:03.170
you know, super deluxe circuit
board albums than I ever

376
00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:05.000
thought I would. So the
idea was to kind of

377
00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:08.300
repeat that success in kind
of a more controlled way

378
00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:11.930
with the Kickstarter and, and
the cassette seemed like a

379
00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:14.810
natural kind of like next
step. What is great about

380
00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:17.390
the cassette is as far
as like a small portable,

381
00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:21.110
you know, artifacts, like, I
mean, there's no cassette in

382
00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:23.210
there, but there's a cassette
case and you see like

383
00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:25.340
a, that case and you
know, it's music and that's

384
00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:27.800
one of the challenges. If
you're still trying to produce

385
00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:32.750
physical artifacts for music, you
know, for releasing music, like

386
00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:35.180
I am, there's this question
of like, you know, does

387
00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:39.080
a USB stick really, you
know, carry the weight and

388
00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:41.990
the message of like, I
am an awesome music artifact,

389
00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:45.770
you know, even like a
customized USB stick, you know,

390
00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:49.390
so this is, this is
a USB stick, like on

391
00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:51.430
it, it kind of is
a custom USB stick, but

392
00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:53.830
it's a little bit fancier
than that. It's a musical

393
00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:58.960
instrument. So it's called the
voice crusher, the voice crusher.

394
00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:02.860
Yes, it's got a microphone
and a speaker, so you

395
00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:05.770
can use it battery powered.
And it's got a really

396
00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:09.820
low fidelity pit shifter built
into it. And I circuit

397
00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:11.470
bent that in a bunch
of different ways. So you

398
00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:16.930
can kinda mangle your voice
into these distorted and shifted

399
00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:23.170
and modulating eight bit weird
sounds. That's, that's where the

400
00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:26.620
crusher comes from. It's not
a, a pretty sounding kind

401
00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:29.220
of thing, but it's really
fun. Didn't it? Did you

402
00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:31.830
make this yourself? I mean,
I use such a skill,

403
00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:33.780
not only software, you said
that you can do programming

404
00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:36.150
your musician. You also have
hardware skills. Cause I see

405
00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:38.820
pictures of prototypes. Like you
had some mentorship from a

406
00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:42.270
friend to put this together.
Yeah. This is me like

407
00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:46.140
inching a little closer to
being like a super low

408
00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:48.960
level electrical engineer. So I
had mentorship from somebody who

409
00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:51.810
is a proper electrical engineer
and I basically do a

410
00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:53.520
bunch of work and take
it to him, ask him

411
00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:56.430
much questions and then move
on. So that is really

412
00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:59.250
the first thing. I mean,
I've made all these things,

413
00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:01.200
but they were all built,
you know, with like, Oh

414
00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:03.930
well, it's, it's a mini
controller kit. You know, they

415
00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:06.570
give you the microcontroller and
you can just attach sensors

416
00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:08.430
to it. And that's kind
of, how do we know?

417
00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:10.050
And a lot of these
platforms work is you don't

418
00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:12.630
really have to know programming.
You don't really have to

419
00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:15.240
know electrical engineering. You can
just learn enough to make

420
00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:19.680
the thing go. But in
this case, besides the actual

421
00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:22.290
pitch shifting circuit, which is,
which is an integrated circuit,

422
00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:26.790
all the other stuff was
me figuring it out, learning

423
00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:32.370
how to make analog filters
and you know, hack circuits

424
00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:36.480
in interesting and playable ways.
And yeah, and this is

425
00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:39.900
the first manufacturing project to,
so I'm working with this

426
00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:46.200
Chinese manufacturer and learning how
that wacky process works Complicated

427
00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:49.290
than, than people realize. I
think that folks get the

428
00:22:49.290 --> 00:22:52.020
wrong idea about Kickstarter. They
think it's a store. They

429
00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:53.700
think they bought something and
they want it, they got

430
00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:55.590
it. They bought a widget
and they want you to

431
00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:57.450
see where's my widget. You
didn't send me my widget

432
00:22:57.450 --> 00:23:00.420
in time, but this is,
this is donut. This is

433
00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:03.660
almost a donation with a,
with a prize. If you

434
00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:07.410
were right about who you
donated. Yeah. That's how I

435
00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:10.470
think of it. I mean,
it's, it's kinda weird. I'm

436
00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:15.030
wielding the Kickstarter campaign power,
right? Cause all these people

437
00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:18.210
have, have donated or pledged
or, you know, there's all

438
00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:20.430
these different words you can
use for what that the

439
00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:22.350
form of that money is.
And, and many of them

440
00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:26.940
are expecting very different things.
But I think I did

441
00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:29.880
a really good job of
sort of like combining things

442
00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:32.670
that, that people really want.
And, and most of the

443
00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:37.050
people that pledged the campaign
are, are, you know, existing

444
00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:39.450
fans of mine and people
that have been following my

445
00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:42.480
work for awhile. And I
think they can totally appreciate

446
00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:46.790
that. I'm not an electrical
engineer. I haven't worked with

447
00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:49.670
a Chinese manufacturer before. So
when he read all the

448
00:23:49.670 --> 00:23:53.060
updates and you see the,
that little Odyssey as well,

449
00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:55.850
as, you know, I'm producing
a music album and, and,

450
00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.710
and just paying the bills
with other gigs on the

451
00:23:57.710 --> 00:24:01.520
side, people are very sympathetic
and understanding, I think, and

452
00:24:02.650 --> 00:24:05.510
I'm glad you bring that
up about Kickstarter. That's not

453
00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:08.410
a store. Well, certainly people
can, can go up and

454
00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:10.240
they can look on your
site. They can hit by.

455
00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:12.550
They can see your debut
album, which was the circuit

456
00:24:12.550 --> 00:24:15.460
board CD 2008, which is
really, really cool. It's a

457
00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:19.450
nice adjunct, a CD in
a case which itself has

458
00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:21.490
circuits. It's really, it's almost
a piece it's a piece

459
00:24:21.490 --> 00:24:24.160
of art in itself before
you even play it, which

460
00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:27.100
is really cool. Because like
you said, people aren't necessarily

461
00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:30.040
necessarily saying, Hey, I heard
your album. They're saying, Hey,

462
00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:33.190
I saw you gig is
a visual, very visual aspect

463
00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:35.380
of what you're doing. They
can also of course preorder

464
00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:38.170
the four track in the
voice crusher, but it's not

465
00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:39.730
done yet. You know, this
is going to take some

466
00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:42.850
time to put these things
together. Yeah. They take time,

467
00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:45.340
but they're coming along great.
And I I'm, I'm expecting

468
00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:47.590
to have the album finished
by the end of the

469
00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:52.300
year. Very, very cool. Now
do you, do you spend

470
00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:55.360
a lot of time, like,
and forgive my ignorance, like

471
00:24:55.570 --> 00:24:57.700
soldering and tinkering and just
trying to figure out how

472
00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:00.910
to make things sound right.
Or, you know, how do

473
00:25:00.910 --> 00:25:05.530
you go about how you
kind of separate your time

474
00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:07.000
as far as like, there
has to be time to

475
00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.920
tinker and be creative, but
then you gotta gig and

476
00:25:09.150 --> 00:25:13.180
pay the rent. Yeah. Well,
it's, it's an ever challenging

477
00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:15.550
thing. Time management is a
whole topic. When I, when

478
00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:18.580
I do like a workshop
and I have a lot

479
00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:23.140
of strategies and involves lots
of lists and from minders,

480
00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:27.040
pop it up on my
phone and different techniques for

481
00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:29.200
dealing with the world right
now. I have a sticky

482
00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:31.870
in front of me that
I made about a week

483
00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:34.210
ago. Cause I was in
Europe for three weeks and

484
00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:37.270
I was in burning man
for a week and trying

485
00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:39.760
to get like really, really
focused on the album. Again,

486
00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:41.770
it takes a lot of
discipline. So this is just

487
00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:43.660
a list of like, you
know, put the phone in

488
00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:46.270
airplane mode, get it away
from me. Don't touch the

489
00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:51.760
internet until like three in
the afternoon when responding to

490
00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:54.670
messages and email, like it's
okay to delete them. If

491
00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:57.580
they don't require a response,
it is okay to say

492
00:25:57.580 --> 00:26:01.570
no, it's okay to be
brief. So yeah, it's an

493
00:26:01.570 --> 00:26:06.550
ever challenging average challenging thing,
but it keeps life really

494
00:26:06.550 --> 00:26:08.950
interesting. And my days are
a lot more pleasurable when

495
00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:10.810
I spend like, you know,
some time in front of

496
00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:15.820
the computer doing something, you
know, like more mouse and

497
00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:18.520
keyboard. And I spend some
time with instruments and singing

498
00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:20.830
and then I spent some
time in the workshop tinkering,

499
00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:23.620
like, you know, I'm, I'm,
I'm, I love all these

500
00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:25.530
things and being able to
do them all every day

501
00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:29.560
usually makes me happiest. Where
would you send someone who's

502
00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:31.840
maybe a child or if
I know you do workshops

503
00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:34.090
and you've taught you also
do private tutoring and things

504
00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:36.190
like that on Skype. But
if you have a kid

505
00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:39.160
who's interested in music, do
you send them to download

506
00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:41.710
some software to go get
like Ableton live or something

507
00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:44.850
like that? Or where's step
zero for someone who's interested

508
00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:47.510
in getting involved in this
kind of a community? Oh,

509
00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:49.100
that's a great idea. I
mean, I know a lot

510
00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:51.590
of people who do it
successfully is as you're suggesting

511
00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:54.260
through the internet, like downloading
some software, looking at video

512
00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:57.680
tutorials and getting on forums
and stuff to ask questions.

513
00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:00.920
So that's definitely what I
tell people. I, you know,

514
00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:03.230
I get a lot of
people who discover me through

515
00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:06.380
the internet, so there are
people all around the world.

516
00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:10.310
And so that's the kind
of ground ground, the starting

517
00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:13.160
point that I give those
people. Is there a particular

518
00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:15.680
piece of software? Like I,
as a podcast or I

519
00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:19.280
can say, go get audacity,
pick up a $30 mic

520
00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:21.650
and try it out. You
know, what's the, I have

521
00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:23.630
a hundred bucks and I
want to start to learn

522
00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:25.880
about controllers and I want
to go buy electronic music.

523
00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:30.020
And where's that step? That
first step. Yeah, I recommend

524
00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:32.480
Ableton cause that's, that's what
got me into it. You

525
00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:35.390
know, it was the first
version of Ableton and 2001,

526
00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:38.870
2002 that I was using
plenty of other software before

527
00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:43.250
that. But my favorite tool
was, was one called Sonic

528
00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:46.520
Foundry acid. That was actually
very similar to the first

529
00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:49.970
version of Ableton. And I
think you probably even inspired

530
00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:52.520
a lot of what Ableton
is. So, you know, I

531
00:27:52.530 --> 00:27:55.550
found that tool and able,
able to it's gotten a

532
00:27:55.550 --> 00:27:58.480
lot more complex. Actually. That's
something I can appreciate is,

533
00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:02.270
you know, after nine revisions,
you know, it's got a

534
00:28:02.270 --> 00:28:05.720
zillion more features and it's
not quite the, the little,

535
00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:09.530
like one trick pony it
used to be, but it's,

536
00:28:09.890 --> 00:28:15.140
it's a very powerful and
very, yeah, it's really powerful,

537
00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:18.710
but it's just, there's, there's
nothing else comparable to it

538
00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:21.560
as far as like ease
of use and immediacy. And

539
00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:24.080
the fact that it's called
live, I think is great

540
00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:27.440
because they've stayed true to
that word. And they've, they've

541
00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:30.500
kept it a very real
time application and they've kept

542
00:28:30.530 --> 00:28:32.450
lots of features in it
that make it good for

543
00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:35.900
performance. And there's no other
piece of music, software that's

544
00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:39.890
as mature as that, that
started as a live music

545
00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:44.360
performance instrument. So it's, it's
pretty unique. Do your controllers

546
00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:47.240
interface with these applications or
are they self contained? Are

547
00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:49.760
you telling, are you pushing
buttons and telling your computer

548
00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:51.830
to do something or are
you manipulating the sound in

549
00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:55.910
the controller itself? Other controllers
are all pretty, pretty dumb.

550
00:28:55.910 --> 00:28:59.090
So to speak. They're just
sending out mini over USB

551
00:28:59.510 --> 00:29:03.020
to the computer and anything
fancy happens inside the computer.

552
00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:06.980
Cool. So people can go
up to moldova.com. They can

553
00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:08.960
check out your store, they
can see your videos. You're

554
00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:12.830
all over YouTube. You're you're
all talked about on Wikipedia

555
00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:16.490
as well. It's pretty cool.
Where am I on Wikipedia?

556
00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:18.230
Oh, and the controller. Isn't
the guy Roller ism and

557
00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:21.350
terminal. Turntablism your reference? It's
cool to be referenced on

558
00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:25.390
Wikipedia. Yeah. I need to
get my own page Dude.

559
00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:27.590
It's crime, man. I don't
know. They deleted mine. I'm

560
00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:30.320
not notable. It's deleted it.
I have a whole, this

561
00:29:30.330 --> 00:29:32.570
there's a whole discussion. They're
like, yeah, he's just, he's

562
00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:37.340
done. I haven't done enough
stuff. Enough stuff. Okay. Do

563
00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:40.220
more stuff. Get that second
album. And then it'll be

564
00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:42.850
early. You know how many
albums you have Of original

565
00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:45.640
music? Just, just the one
which people can get on

566
00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:49.270
Amazon MP3 digital download. Yeah.
That one is absolutely everywhere.

567
00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:52.750
And then the followup is
coming soon. Very cool. Well,

568
00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:54.910
thanks so much for chatting
with me today. Yeah, my

569
00:29:54.910 --> 00:29:57.220
pleasure. This is super fun,
Scott. This has been another

570
00:29:57.220 --> 00:29:59.470
