11
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.450
what it's like to have
the number one app in

12
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:09.690
the Apple app store. Hi,
this is Scott Hanselman. This

13
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.000
is another episode of Hansel
minutes, and I'm talking with

14
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.470
Amir Rashaan about his number
one app store application, a

15
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.080
dark room. Thanks for chatting
with me. Hey Scott, how's

16
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.680
it going? Pretty good. Congratulations
on your success. I think

17
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.920
a a top app store
app is certainly a grounds

18
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.770
for congratulations. Thank you. Thank
you very much. This is

19
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.200
pretty exciting. And I think
what's, what's exciting about talking

20
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.630
with you today. Isn't just
that you are now a

21
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.390
number one, you know, a
person who can claim a

22
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.330
number one app, but that
you're really, really transparent about

23
00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.310
it. And that's why you
offered to talk with me

24
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.570
today. Yeah, actually, well, I
guess the way it started

25
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.930
out was, you know, develop
the app and it wasn't

26
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.060
doing very well at all,
but I still wanted a

27
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.390
log. Like everything happened, everything
that happened. There's so many

28
00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.270
people that hold that information
so close to them and

29
00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.580
I really don't understand why.
So I just kept a

30
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.820
developer log and starting all
it's been, I guess it's

31
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.540
14 months long now. So
the developer logs really long

32
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.180
and I've just been continuing
to update it. And every

33
00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.580
observation I've made with regards
to the app store, just

34
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.410
put it on there. Do
you think that people are

35
00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.290
just like either embarrassed or
they're like, they don't want

36
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.780
to give up how much
money they made because they

37
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.690
think people might be envious
of their money. I don't

38
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.510
know real well, first of
all, I guess the way

39
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.670
that I've set up the
app, I haven't made a

40
00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.040
lot of money on the
app. Even you would think

41
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.320
that being the number one
app, you've like, you hear

42
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.200
that you have arrived, right?
Right. I'm pretty much assuming

43
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.150
you've arrived. No, I have
not arrived, but, but yeah,

44
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.090
I really don't know what
it is. I think they

45
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.390
somehow think it's like a
market secret or, or what,

46
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.600
but I just think that,
you know, having that information

47
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.400
available to everyone will dissuade
those that want to make

48
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.830
an app strictly for the
money or maybe inspire others

49
00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.290
to make an app and
potentially do something with it.

50
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.700
Yeah. Now we'll get, we'll
get into the details. But

51
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.770
I think that it does
speak to the issue of

52
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.290
what they call the long
tail. It's a really long

53
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.040
tail, like there's angry birds.
And then there's the occasional,

54
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.120
multi-week long number one bestselling
app like yourself and then

55
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.640
there's everybody else. And I
guess some of the stats

56
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.530
have been saying that if
you make an app, if

57
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.930
you make a couple of
grand, you're pretty lucky person.

58
00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.680
Yes, I would. I would
agree with that. I think,

59
00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.230
I think if you can
make three to four grand

60
00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.650
in a year, I think
that's really good. Why does

61
00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.270
it people, what do people
make it feel like it's

62
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.310
a gold mine? Like it's
a gold rush, like, you

63
00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.140
know, get your app and
make your million cause no,

64
00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.260
one's making a million bucks.
Yeah. You know, maybe originally

65
00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.110
it was maybe originally it
was really easy for independent

66
00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.570
developers to, you know, to
make it in the app

67
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.660
store. But the moment that,
you know, AAA companies start

68
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.920
seeing the app store and
start marketing and investing all

69
00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.080
that information. I mean all
that money into growing their

70
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.440
own applications. And that's when
the independent developer, you know,

71
00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.410
loses out because that's, those
are the apps that are

72
00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.400
going to make the top
top rings. Okay. So we

73
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.440
don't need to go too
much into the details about

74
00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:06.540
like the story about your
app, but it's a really

75
00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.970
interesting story and that it
is a text based app.

76
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.750
It's kind of a unusual,
and it is extremely Spartan

77
00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.700
if I may in its
UI. Yes. So this is

78
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.740
my first iOS app. So
when I came across the,

79
00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:21.660
the web based version of
the darkroom, so it was

80
00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.060
actually a web based game
and I poured it over

81
00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.790
to iOS and added my
own storyline and pacing and

82
00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.690
all that other good stuff.
So I saw the game,

83
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.570
I was like, Oh, Hey,
this is, this is a

84
00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.270
great really fun game. And
you know, it's not a

85
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.700
three D two D crazy
game. I could, I could

86
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.130
learn I was development with
this. And, you know, maybe

87
00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.470
just bring it, bring it
over to iOS and half

88
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.060
haven't happened in the app
store. So it was kind

89
00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.670
of like one of those
fun little projects. So I

90
00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.790
emailed Michael Michael Townsend. He's the guy
that created the web version

91
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.740
of the game. And I
asked him, Hey, can I

92
00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.980
port this over? And he
said, yes. So it was

93
00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.770
like, Oh, easy project. And
my entire app is made

94
00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.430
out of text buttons, text
boxes, buttons, labels, and progress

95
00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.300
bars. It's really funny when
recruiters contact me and say,

96
00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.550
Hey, we saw you had
the number one app and

97
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.610
I go, have you played
it? Because I think you

98
00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.180
might want someone with a
little bit more experience. And

99
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.770
I remember when you sent
it to me, you sent

100
00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.540
me a preview early on
and you were like, check

101
00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.400
this out. And I have
to say, I was like,

102
00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.540
yeah, you know, I mean,
you were really cool about

103
00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.880
it, but I would have
to say that I did

104
00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.270
not peg it as a
number one app. I said,

105
00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.430
Hey, really cool of you
to give me a coupon,

106
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.590
let me play it and
try it out. But you

107
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.640
know, good luck, you know,
go with God, Neither did

108
00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:39.270
I, neither did I don't
worry Forward. And you have

109
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:45.300
21,113 ratings. And it is
a four and a half,

110
00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:49.770
almost five star reviewed site.
And people are just going

111
00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:53.370
on perfection in an app.
My proud first review of

112
00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.350
an app, people are saying
this game is perfect in

113
00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:58.220
every way possible and emotional
and beautiful story that gets

114
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.800
better as you play it.
That's pretty hardcore for an

115
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.050
app that has a button
and a text box. Yes,

116
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.270
yes it is. I thought
they were joking, but it

117
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.720
is pretty intense as it's
a big scifi, Epic that

118
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.910
starts with lighting a fire.
Yeah. And actually when, so

119
00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:14.740
what happened was that, you
know, the app pretty much,

120
00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:17.890
I deployed it in November
and for like four or

121
00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:20.920
five months, it did absolutely
nothing. And then, and then

122
00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:23.590
out of nowhere, it went
viral in the UK. It

123
00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:27.460
just, it went from 1500th
ranked app to the number

124
00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:31.060
one app overall in two
days. How I have no

125
00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:33.760
idea, I have speculations with
regards to how that happened.

126
00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:36.760
It had media coverage back
in, I guess, November and

127
00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.450
December of the year before.
So like three months earlier

128
00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:43.840
from edit editors that were
in the UK, but I

129
00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.940
couldn't really correlate it outside
of that. And I looked

130
00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:47.860
online to see if anyone
was talking about it in

131
00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.110
the UK. I think it
got mentioned the sun, but

132
00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:52.810
that was after it hit
the number one spot. So

133
00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:54.940
I think it was just
like a butterfly effect. Someone

134
00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:57.610
told someone and those people
told the right people and

135
00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:01.090
suddenly it jumped up. But
as soon as that happened,

136
00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:04.120
it became the number one
app. And suddenly it wasn't

137
00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.940
just an in the RPG
category, it was the number

138
00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.730
one app. And then you
see all these reviews like,

139
00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:12.040
Oh, this is my first
review ever. And this app

140
00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:15.460
is incredible moving. It changed
my life. And then the

141
00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:18.100
regular people, I guess those
people that aren't entire PG

142
00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:20.590
started downloading the app and
they were like, this is

143
00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:24.010
a scam. So I would
get, I would get, I

144
00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:26.770
would get reviews. One star
reviews. I would say this

145
00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:29.650
app is a scam. He
bought all the reviews that

146
00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:32.650
are there. It's impossible. There's
no way that this app

147
00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:36.220
could be anything, anything more,
it's just one button. And

148
00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:40.030
it's ridiculous. Do you do
anything as far as PR

149
00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:42.460
or telling reviewers to go
and review this or was

150
00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:46.900
this entirely luck and organic?
So I did, I did

151
00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:49.210
a, quite a bit of
promotion on a Reddit and

152
00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:51.790
touch our arcade. So I
had a re a lot

153
00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:54.100
of good engagement there. So
throughout this, I'd like to

154
00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:56.230
give like tips to people
that want to do apps.

155
00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.330
And one of these, one
of the tips that I

156
00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:00.040
would like to say is
that when you, when you

157
00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:03.190
have an app and you're
looking for engagement and you

158
00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:05.080
have promo codes, you get
a hundred promo codes per

159
00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:08.740
release. Don't just give away
the promo codes, because it's

160
00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:12.190
so easy for bots to
syndicate that and scarf those

161
00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:16.510
up. And it's just impersonal.
So what I ended up

162
00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:19.330
doing was I went into
a Reddit, our app hookup.

163
00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:23.260
It's one of the like
big subreddits for applications. And

164
00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.270
what I would do would,
is I would write on

165
00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:27.550
my developer blog. And then
I would say, Hey, I've

166
00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:29.470
got 10 promo codes to
give away. If you read

167
00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:33.010
this blog entry and, and
put a commentary, showing me

168
00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:34.510
that you read the entry,
then I'll give you a

169
00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:37.960
promo code. So not only
did that get rid of

170
00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:39.520
the, get rid of the
box, it's a little bit

171
00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.220
more manual, but then they
started knowing me as a

172
00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:46.510
person instead of just this
trend, this unnamed company. And

173
00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:47.830
then I gave them a
promo code and they were

174
00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:50.380
probably more inclined to build
that up. But as far

175
00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:52.420
as marketing, that's really all
I did was, you know,

176
00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:55.590
browse forums and do this
interaction, do this form of

177
00:08:55.590 --> 00:09:01.550
interaction with, I guess, other
gamers And, okay, so, so

178
00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:04.610
the, you, you pushed it
from like developer to developer

179
00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:07.190
or fan to fan, but
you didn't have a PR

180
00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:09.590
agency. You didn't like, there's
lots of people who will

181
00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:11.780
tell you that they will
promote your game or your

182
00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:15.020
app for you. You know,
I would get those emails

183
00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:17.270
saying that, Hey, we'll give
you so many downloads or

184
00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:20.960
so many reviews for this
much money and get you

185
00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.120
up there. But I, you
know, I've never, I never

186
00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:26.330
bit those that those bullets,
I guess, and I just,

187
00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:29.330
it was just really organic.
Oh, another thing I did

188
00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:33.290
was, so the game went
viral on the web and

189
00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:35.300
I'm on Twitter. You know,
Twitter blew up for a

190
00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:38.870
good month with the game
and they always embed the

191
00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:41.000
URL. So it was really
easy for me to search

192
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.670
for the game on Twitter.
And then I would, I

193
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:46.760
created an account for, for
the game as any person

194
00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:52.340
should do. Right. And, and
now that almost that served

195
00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:54.530
as a, a sales funnel
for me. So I would

196
00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:57.260
reply in the context of
the game. So I wouldn't

197
00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.870
say, Hey, there's an iOS
version. I'd say, Oh, you

198
00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:01.640
know, every time you stoke
the fire, I take a

199
00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:04.610
piece of your soul or
I'm going to send villagers.

200
00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:06.200
I mean, I'm going to
send snarling beasts to kill

201
00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.810
your villagers or something like
that. And they enjoyed that

202
00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:12.620
interaction. And I built relationships
even with some video game

203
00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:16.490
editors. I built relationships with
some editors from giant bomb

204
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:20.810
from Gamasutra from pocket tactics,
just, just by having that

205
00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:23.810
interaction, that exchange, they didn't
really retweet me one or

206
00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:27.770
two people would, but then
later on when, when sales

207
00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:29.720
were low, I just emailed
them and saying, Hey, I'm

208
00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:32.030
the guy that built a
dark room. And we spoke

209
00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:34.130
on Twitter for, you know,
a couple of tweets. Is

210
00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:35.690
there any way you can
help me out? Or, you

211
00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:37.700
know, do you have any
tips? And I was able

212
00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:40.370
to build those relationships too.
So it was all organic

213
00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:42.470
and just, you know, know
me as a person, know

214
00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:45.230
Michael as a person, and
then go from there. Well,

215
00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:47.360
I liked that you were
saying that your Twitter account

216
00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:50.120
stayed in the voice of
the game, the same kind

217
00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.580
of writing the same style,
and it's got over a

218
00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:55.430
thousand followers and people are
even now still interacting with

219
00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:58.250
the Twitter account. So that's
a really good tip for

220
00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:02.150
people to understand. Now, Michael,
your partner made the web

221
00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:04.280
edition and you poured it
over to iOS and then

222
00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:06.770
kind of made it your
own. But you worked at

223
00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:10.220
a split with him financially.
Yeah. Yeah. We've he basically

224
00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:12.860
gets effectively, it's a royalty,
I call it a royalty

225
00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:16.460
payment. So he gets 50%
royalty on, on his creation.

226
00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:19.370
And he handles a lot
of the legal aspects too.

227
00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:22.550
So, you know, trademarks and
all that, all that good

228
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:26.930
stuff, because effectively it's, it's
his work and I'm paying

229
00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:30.560
him royalties for that. And
what kind of downloads, if

230
00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.240
you have you gotten, like,
there's really no way for

231
00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.220
me as a consumer to
tell other than a lot

232
00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:37.460
of ratings, I'm assuming maybe
one in 10 people rate.

233
00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:40.820
So a couple of hundred
thousand. Yeah. It's 1%. So

234
00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:44.510
1%. Yeah. So I actually
have a very high conversion

235
00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:47.180
rate. So your conversion rate
for downloads is about one

236
00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:50.090
to 2%. Okay. So let
me give you like a

237
00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:52.430
little bit of ranking idea.
So you can, with that,

238
00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:55.270
you can actually, how many
downloads a game is making.

239
00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:58.600
Okay. So I'm at the,
at the top of your

240
00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:02.320
category, specifically RPG and almost
pick RPG because it's more

241
00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:05.890
stable being that, you know,
not very many RPGs come

242
00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:08.380
out, at least relative to
like adventure games or puzzle

243
00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:10.720
games or all that stuff.
But to get to the

244
00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:13.780
number one spot at the
RPG category, you need to

245
00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:16.900
have a four day moving
average. So it's based on

246
00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:19.630
four days, you need to
have four days of downloads

247
00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:23.220
at around three to 400
downloads a day. That's not

248
00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:25.140
as big a number as
I would think. When you

249
00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:27.930
see Apple people on stage
talking about how big the

250
00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:30.390
app store is and billions
of this and millions of

251
00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:33.300
that five, 600 downloads a
day for a couple of

252
00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:35.550
days, but you, number one
Puts you in number one

253
00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:38.940
in your category. What does
that mean? That the app

254
00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:41.400
store isn't as big and
expansive and a moneymaking machine

255
00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:44.250
as we thought it was.
So, so let me share

256
00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:48.000
some revenue revenue numbers. Okay.
So where I'm at right

257
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.260
now, I'm, I'm averaging about
five to 600 downloads a

258
00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.410
day right now, which is
nice. It's a good amount

259
00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:58.500
of passive income. When I
was at the number one

260
00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:02.160
spot I download, I got
20,000 downloads in one day

261
00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:06.360
and I average 10 to
20,000 downloads for 18 days

262
00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:09.420
straight in, in the paid
in the paid app store.

263
00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:11.970
Okay. You didn't give any
money back. Did anyone say,

264
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.760
Oh, this sucks giving my
money back. There's a refund.

265
00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:17.370
There's a way to get
refunds for apps. You just

266
00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:19.320
report. You're supposed to like
report an issue. It's not

267
00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:21.900
really obvious, but you report
an issue and say, not

268
00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:24.660
app. Wasn't what I expected
to be. And they'll get

269
00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:28.650
a refund that way, but
that's handled through them. Huge

270
00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:30.480
deal for you. You didn't
think about that as a

271
00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:33.360
bill? No, no, it wasn't.
It was, it's such a

272
00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:36.420
small percentage and the legal
ones are review saying they

273
00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:38.610
hate it. But as far
as that that's that's as

274
00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:43.130
far as it goes. So,
so what happened was you'll,

275
00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:46.590
you'll get 10 to 15,000
downloads a day at that

276
00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:49.080
spot. So if you look
at the top 10 apps

277
00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:52.290
in the paint section, that's
what they're bringing in every

278
00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:55.440
day. Okay. So you're just
a 99 cent game. So we'll

279
00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:59.940
figure a buck and you're
doing 10,000 downloads a day.

280
00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:03.930
So you're figuring $10,000. 3000
of that goes to Apple,

281
00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:07.260
3000 goes to Apple. So
then you have 7,000 left.

282
00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:10.050
You split it with your
partner. That's 3,500. Then a

283
00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:13.710
third of that is taxes
for your percent. 45% is

284
00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:16.860
taxes. Yeah. So you pay
income tax plus a 15%

285
00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:19.920
self employment tax. And I've
talked to two to three

286
00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:22.020
CPAs and some they're like,
Oh, if you quote, if

287
00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:24.780
you incorporate, then you're paying
taxes at the corporate level,

288
00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:27.330
and then you can issue
yourself like a salary, but

289
00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:31.140
then you pay taxes on
that. So there's, I'm maybe

290
00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:35.040
able to save maybe three
to 4% in taxes with,

291
00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:37.290
with the other side being
that, you know, I have

292
00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:40.920
to handle minutes and, you
know, stock options and all

293
00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:43.380
that good stuff, but the
government's going to get us

294
00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:45.930
money and it's going to
be about 45%. Okay. So

295
00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:49.050
let's just say 50%. So
10 grand, 10 grand, a

296
00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:53.720
day, three grand Apple in
lots of people have partners.

297
00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:54.950
So you think it's not
unusual that you have a

298
00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:58.040
partner, so then you figure
3,500 cut that in half

299
00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:03.530
1750, maybe some expenses, 1500
bucks a day. Yep. Cleared

300
00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:06.380
for yourself for, and how
long did you continue to

301
00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:09.740
do this? That was for
18 days for 18 days.

302
00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:12.580
So then you're make 20,
25 grand. Yep. So I

303
00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:14.680
can give you a grand
total. So for 14 months,

304
00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:18.670
I'm taking the time that
it took to develop the

305
00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:21.310
app. It took four months
to develop the app and

306
00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:23.590
it took another five months
for it to hit the

307
00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:26.050
number one spot and all
that. So I'm incorporating all

308
00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:30.670
that time. My grand total
for downloads is 680,000 paid

309
00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:34.960
downloads, 680,000 paid downloads. After
all of a sudden done

310
00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:39.790
I'm netting, I'm netting, 19 cents
per download, which comes out

311
00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:45.760
to about a bill rate
of $112 an hour. So

312
00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:47.740
then you're, you're being, and
you're not, are you considering

313
00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:51.970
support hours and upgrade hours?
And I'm saying that if

314
00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:53.770
I ever had a full
time job, if I had

315
00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:55.690
a full time job, 40
hours a week, 40 hours

316
00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:59.110
a week, whatever, if I
landed a job that would

317
00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:02.350
give me $112 an hour
as an independent, as an

318
00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:05.230
independent contractor, you're making as
much as the number one

319
00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:08.140
app in the app store.
So if you're a developer,

320
00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:10.300
who's billing yourself out at
a hundred dollars an hour

321
00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:11.950
in the U S you're
doing great. You got a

322
00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:14.230
pretty good gig and you
might be thinking I'm going

323
00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:17.500
to quit my job. Don't
do it as a paid

324
00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:21.190
consultant to maybe take the
chance that I could be

325
00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:23.050
one of the few people
who could have a number

326
00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:25.570
one app, and I will
make effectively the same amount

327
00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:29.200
of money without presumably without
healthcare, at least in at

328
00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:31.810
least in the U S
yep. That's correct. So you

329
00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:33.460
did not quit your job
and buy a Tesla is

330
00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:37.280
what I'm hearing. Well, I
did quit my job. No.

331
00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:40.300
What happened? No. So I
actually took a sabbatical. I

332
00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:43.030
was on a, when I
started working on a darkroom,

333
00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:46.930
I actually took a sabbatical
downsize, sold everything. I own

334
00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:50.500
basically rage, quit everything. And
then I was like, then

335
00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:52.720
I'd bench coated on everything
I possibly could for three

336
00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:54.700
months, I got bored of
that. And then I worked

337
00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:56.710
on the game. So it
was just a way, and

338
00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:59.560
that's all covered in my
developer blog and blog. Well,

339
00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:01.420
we'll be sure to include
that in the show notes

340
00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:04.750
so people can get all
the, Yeah. And I'm fairly

341
00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:06.940
candid with regards to my
emotions when I was going

342
00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:09.490
through mentally, physically, you know,
all those things are on

343
00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:12.340
there on top of, on
top of revenue numbers. So

344
00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:15.220
I quit my job and
then made the number one

345
00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:18.130
app. And, you know, I
took that gamble. Right. And

346
00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:20.260
I bet on a bet
on black and I got

347
00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:23.500
it and I'm pulling my
chips out. I've went back

348
00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:26.620
to work. I'm now an
independent consultant. So that's nice.

349
00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:30.070
So I, I do the
passive income is good. Right?

350
00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:32.830
It's great passive income, but
it's not something I can,

351
00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:36.310
I can readily a bet
on. So what happened was

352
00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:39.160
about two months ago, and
this is crazy. This is

353
00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:42.130
absolutely crazy. I'll fickle. The
market is, is that you

354
00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:43.510
go from a number one
app. And I would, I,

355
00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:45.940
I expected that there would
be some kind of leveling

356
00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:48.880
off, right. Something that I
can count on saying that

357
00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:52.020
I can count on these
downloads to be there for

358
00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:54.600
a long time. But I
went back to where I

359
00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:57.360
was before I ever went
viral. So I was remembered

360
00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:01.260
I was celebrated. And then,
and then forgotten about two

361
00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:04.680
months later, it was ridiculous.
So I was down to

362
00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:08.250
a hundred downloads a day,
which is, which is nothing,

363
00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:12.030
right? It's 20 bucks. And
during that time period, I

364
00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:13.980
said, okay, I'm going to
go ahead and make the

365
00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:17.370
app free. Just, just to,
you know, up the downloads,

366
00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:21.240
maybe get a new insurgence
of people playing the game.

367
00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:24.960
And I actually made it
to the number three spot

368
00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:29.190
in the free app store
and enraged. Your people who'd

369
00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:31.860
already paid. Nope, not at
all. They were, they were,

370
00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:34.370
I'm more than happy to
see that. And I, I

371
00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:38.250
stayed, I stayed free for
seven days. And in that

372
00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:40.970
seven day period, I got
a million downloads. See, and

373
00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:44.600
this is the thing, man.
It bugs me so much.

374
00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:48.080
It's a buck, it's a
book, it's a buck. And

375
00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:53.480
these cheap will not pay
a fricking dollar and they

376
00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:55.610
will whinge about it. And
they will write blog posts

377
00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:58.700
and books about how they
will not pay it. And

378
00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:01.670
that you put it free
though. I had, I had

379
00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:05.420
a windows windows, phone app,
very simple app that you

380
00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:08.060
put your name on your
lock screen. So if you

381
00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:11.960
lost your phone, you know,
it would show you your,

382
00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:13.970
your name on the lock
screen. And it's very well

383
00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:17.990
designed. It's lovely. And people
can download it. I had

384
00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:24.560
300 downloads, 300 people paid
99 cents. I got frustrated. I

385
00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:25.850
said, well, I guess I'm
not going to quit my

386
00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:32.420
job. I made it free
600,000 downloads later. Someone's like,

387
00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:33.860
you should put ads in
the thing. I'm like, you

388
00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:36.770
know, I should just put
my angry face in it,

389
00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:39.540
shaking my fist at the
people. So that's an, I

390
00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:42.830
have add numbers too. So
I went through that mental

391
00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:44.900
exercise. You put ads in
it? No, no. I was

392
00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:46.400
thinking about it. I was
like, okay, what if I

393
00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:48.710
put ads? What if I
could go back in time?

394
00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:51.320
And I know the numbers
now. Right? So a free

395
00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:54.710
up will literally make an
order of magnitude more downloads

396
00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:57.340
in a paid up. So
I was like, okay, if,

397
00:19:57.340 --> 00:19:59.870
if I was a free
up and I had like

398
00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:03.350
ad mob and I took
their impressions and click through

399
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:05.360
rates, I talked to a
few of my friends, got

400
00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:06.710
their click through rates. And
I was like, okay, let's

401
00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:09.620
see what this would look
like. So your click through

402
00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:13.880
rates are about 28% to
80%. I don't know how

403
00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:16.310
people get 80% click. There
is it's insane. But I've

404
00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:18.740
heard that you're a gain
that you're presumably engrossed in.

405
00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:21.530
Yes. Yeah. So one thing
that, you know, it, it

406
00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:23.270
breaks the spirit of the
game, but if I were

407
00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:26.690
going to do it at
80% click through rates, it's

408
00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:30.830
like being a number one
app at two bucks. So

409
00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:35.300
you were making 19 cents on
a dollar game. Yeah. Per

410
00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:38.840
person. And that rubs, then
that revenue is once yes.

411
00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:41.300
You could make more than
that money. You could basically

412
00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:44.390
make 40 cents on a person.
If, if you have high

413
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:46.070
click through rates, if you
have a high click through

414
00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:51.800
rate, presumably Well, yeah. You
know what I mean? Just

415
00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:53.250
like over the life of
the time that the person

416
00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:56.310
spends with the game. Yeah.
It's basically, so the thing

417
00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:57.960
is you don't get very
much money at all. For

418
00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:01.740
impressions. You could have a
bazillion impressions if that's a

419
00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:04.530
real word, but it won't
actually gain you any money.

420
00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:08.550
It's only if they clicked
you actually make money. So

421
00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:11.970
in retrospect, after having gone
through all that you did,

422
00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:15.090
are you happy with pricing
at 99 cents? Or should you

423
00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:17.580
have made it free? I'm
happy without pricing in an

424
00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:21.660
Island, 99 cents is equivalent to
having a click through rate

425
00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:27.230
about 58%. Okay. So it
was, there's more satisfaction in

426
00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:28.920
the game is the spirit
of the game. It would

427
00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:31.920
be weird with a flashing,
you know, download candy crush

428
00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:34.890
at the bottom of your
game. Yes, that's correct. That's

429
00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:37.110
correct. So, and that's the
thing is, so the question

430
00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:39.210
is how are people making
so much money in the

431
00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:41.220
app store? How are these
people making an app purchases?

432
00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:43.290
If you're going to do
a free game and you're

433
00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:45.750
going to have an app
purchases, don't put it in

434
00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:48.330
that purchase to remove ads
because that's not really going

435
00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:49.830
to get you anything you
want to put in our

436
00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:52.830
purchasing there that add to
the experience like a cool

437
00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:56.640
new weapon or faster bike
or something like that. That's

438
00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:59.040
what people want to buy.
And that's how they can,

439
00:21:59.430 --> 00:22:02.170
that's how you can get
them to convert over, to,

440
00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:04.320
to having an app purchases.
But if you're one of

441
00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:05.850
those developers that says, Oh,
I'm going to put ads,

442
00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:06.990
and then I'm going to
put it in app purchase

443
00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:09.930
that removes the ads it's
not worth doing. Right. And

444
00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:13.200
there definitely is though, I
would say a pretty considerable

445
00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:16.920
backlash going on right now
against in app purchases. I

446
00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:20.610
feel like virtually every game
that I truly enjoy is

447
00:22:20.610 --> 00:22:23.730
a grind. I just got
this great game called Drexel's,

448
00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:26.250
it's a little starch. It's
basically tiny tower for star

449
00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:28.530
Trek. And you know, you
get into it and you

450
00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:31.470
realize they've literally set the
pacing of the game up,

451
00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:34.380
such that you need to
pay five bucks to get

452
00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:36.660
over the hump. It would
be like playing a dark

453
00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:38.760
room for a half an
hour and finding out that

454
00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:42.420
you just cannot make an
economy, produce the things you

455
00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:45.660
need to produce to succeed
without paying $5. Right. And

456
00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:48.390
then the frustration is just
let me buy the game.

457
00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:51.390
Just let me enjoy the
game. Don't nag me. Right.

458
00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:52.980
Just tell me, just tell
me how much you want.

459
00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:55.410
Right. Just give me the,
give me the number for

460
00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:58.440
the coaches that will let
me play the game without

461
00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:02.430
a crippled experience. Right. And,
and that's, you know, that's

462
00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:04.680
unfortunate and that's why we
chose not to do an

463
00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:07.560
app purchase. What do you
feel about the way the

464
00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:10.530
flappy bird guy quit? And
did you, do you think

465
00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:13.860
you relate to him in
his frustrations with his situation?

466
00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:16.710
Alright, so a couple of
things about the platform guy,

467
00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:19.050
we're actually, it's so cool
to actually be able to

468
00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:20.520
say this. I feel like
an impossible, you know, I

469
00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:23.040
go through the imposter syndrome
doing this. We're actually in

470
00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:25.800
a, like a private group
where I can actually talk

471
00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:27.480
with the flappy bird guy.
I can, I can actually

472
00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:31.200
talk with them. It's really
cool. Secret, like Amex black

473
00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:32.490
card that you get when
you get to be a

474
00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:35.610
number one app, they're like,
here's the, the champagne room

475
00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:37.830
back here and you can
talk to them. I got

476
00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:40.260
invited to a gaming group
and he's part of it

477
00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:42.300
too. So, you know, and
he talked about a swing

478
00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:44.160
copter when that came out
also. So it was really

479
00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:47.990
cool, but bird sat in
a void for eight months

480
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:51.010
before it ever went viral,
Same thing. So these things

481
00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:53.890
don't go viral. Like my
app, my echo that I

482
00:23:53.890 --> 00:23:57.550
did with Greg shackles, you
know, it's doing okay. But

483
00:23:57.610 --> 00:24:00.670
somehow we just thought that
on, on its merits, the

484
00:24:00.670 --> 00:24:03.910
world would recognize our, our
brilliance and it just doesn't

485
00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:06.070
work like that. Does it,
It doesn't work like that.

486
00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:08.770
You have to build it,
you have to market it.

487
00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:12.130
You have to build connections.
You have to do media,

488
00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:14.950
everything, you know, all those
things have to come together

489
00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:18.640
and then maybe just maybe
you'll hit the lottery. So

490
00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:21.430
it's really difficult from that
standpoint. No flabby bird guy

491
00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:23.380
had to deal with clones.
Have you had to deal

492
00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:25.930
with clones as well? People
copying your idea. Yeah, I

493
00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:29.110
have. And the frustrating part
is that it's open source.

494
00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:32.590
So people can actually go
online to the, to the

495
00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:36.400
get hub repo. And there,
the clones are literally phone

496
00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:40.540
gap, app implementations of ADR
or the web version. Oh

497
00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:43.780
no. You know, it's, it's
one of those things where

498
00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:47.080
Michael made it open source
for. So you can create

499
00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:49.990
derivative works and create your
own experiences. But what people

500
00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:52.780
are doing is cloning the
repo, wrapping it inside of

501
00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:55.030
a phone gap and them
putting it out there. And

502
00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:57.760
the, and the real tough
part is that the, the

503
00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.730
app went viral in a
week, right? So I had

504
00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:03.700
no time to prepare for
that. We, we submit our

505
00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:09.160
trademark papers that took two
months, and then we have

506
00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:12.130
to wait six months for
people to contest it. And

507
00:25:12.130 --> 00:25:15.910
then we're given the trademark.
So during that time period,

508
00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:18.430
you know, and I've, and
I've tried to bring, bring

509
00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:20.350
them down on Google play.
I've tried to bring down

510
00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:23.080
on iOS and tried to
bring it on windows phone

511
00:25:23.290 --> 00:25:25.270
and all the, all the
forms pretty much say, we

512
00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:28.000
need to trademark number for
you to contest this. And

513
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.620
you can't, you know, you
can say, well, we have

514
00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:33.040
a common law trademark reproductive
protected based on that. It

515
00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:35.800
works on iOS because we're
a number one app, right?

516
00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:38.290
So they've taken attention to
us, but the other app

517
00:25:38.290 --> 00:25:41.230
stores, you know, we have
to, we're kind of stuck

518
00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:44.710
until we get those trademarks
or make the official port

519
00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:47.770
and all that good stuff.
Now, we're not trying to

520
00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:50.860
dissuade people from getting involved,
but we want people to

521
00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:53.260
have their eyes wide open
when they get involved in

522
00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:55.540
mobile app development. And, you
know, the kinds of stuff

523
00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:57.700
that Greg and I had
trouble with were, you know,

524
00:25:57.730 --> 00:26:01.930
writing the thing was 20,
30% of our time, but

525
00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:06.790
business, business, checking, and LLCs
and, you know, incorporations and

526
00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:09.820
trademarks and all that stuff,
all that stuff. That's not

527
00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:12.880
fun that doesn't compile. It
takes up your time. Doesn't

528
00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:15.910
it? And, and, you know,
the, our initial text, my

529
00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:17.830
initial text from my book,
Michael were like, Hey, here's

530
00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:20.260
200 bucks for the month.
And then suddenly I have

531
00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:23.710
to send them a, you
know, a $200,000 check. And

532
00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:26.080
he's like, I think I
need a business account. Like

533
00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:28.660
yeah, you do Well. And
how does that work for

534
00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:30.910
you? If you're not partners,
then you have to think

535
00:26:30.910 --> 00:26:33.160
about that. Like Greg and
I, we made an LLC

536
00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:36.610
made it, you know, half
and half. In this case,

537
00:26:36.610 --> 00:26:40.030
you have an expense to
a contractor effectively, your 10

538
00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:43.410
99 in him, your 10
99 is a tax form

539
00:26:43.410 --> 00:26:45.930
for folks that aren't from
the States where you're going

540
00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:48.600
to have to basically say,
one of my vendors provided

541
00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:51.740
me some value in the
order of $200,000. Yeah. And

542
00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:57.260
the frustrating part is that
he's in Canada. So, so

543
00:26:57.410 --> 00:26:59.440
I have a CPA that
handles all of it. I'm

544
00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:02.570
glad for that part, but,
but it, you know, it's

545
00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:05.210
a wire transfer. It's $50
for the wire transfer. It

546
00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:07.670
costs him, it cost him
another $50 to pull the

547
00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:11.150
money out from. And it's,
you know, it's just, it's

548
00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:14.240
so weird. It's so weird.
And again, it happened so

549
00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:18.470
quickly. We, we just had
to create the partnership. So

550
00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:20.270
that's going to happen hopefully
next year. And, you know,

551
00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:22.400
we can work, work through
that. And it's like, if

552
00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:24.890
I die, or if he
dies, you know, how does

553
00:27:24.890 --> 00:27:27.320
the money get distributed? All
that stuff. We haven't worked

554
00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:29.330
it out. We have an
email that says, yeah, I

555
00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:33.500
get 50%. Now you have
another app, a prequel pre-qual

556
00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:36.020
slash sequel. I was just
updated a couple of days

557
00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:40.520
ago called the Ensign. That's
correct. Is this a, is

558
00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:41.990
this another, it's just a
money grab or is this

559
00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:43.880
a new story? How do
I look at this application?

560
00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:46.160
So I had, I had
to be very careful not

561
00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:48.050
to make it a money
grab because even with the

562
00:27:48.050 --> 00:27:50.120
fans that you have, you
know, you can, it's so

563
00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:52.430
easy to betray their trust
and it's happened a little

564
00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:57.830
bit. So the, the incident
is, is a, a pretty

565
00:27:57.830 --> 00:28:00.500
cool, it's a prequel to
a dark room and it

566
00:28:00.770 --> 00:28:02.690
takes care of it talks
about the events that happened

567
00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:05.930
directly before dark room. Now
it is a remix of

568
00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:08.480
the engine that's currently in
a dark room. So there

569
00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:10.700
were some aspects of that,
but the narrative is the

570
00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:13.850
additional piece that adds that
extra component to it. So

571
00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:16.400
you get a, that world
that you traversed, you have

572
00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:20.960
a much more expensive world,
more intricate, Dungeons, different types

573
00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:24.110
of gear and some additional
new game components in storyline,

574
00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:27.890
but that's effectively what that
is. Do this on your

575
00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:30.110
own. Did you partner again
with Michael? This was, this

576
00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:31.910
was on my own. This
is inspiration that I had.

577
00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:34.550
I really loved traversing the
dusty path. And I was

578
00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:36.560
thinking about, Hey, is there,
is there a good way

579
00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:39.050
where I can set it
up to where I can

580
00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:40.670
make this really hard and
you have to play it.

581
00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:43.780
It's like Pramata and a
real, real good roguelike like

582
00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:47.080
net hack or something like
that. And then, and then

583
00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:50.270
build upon that, that narrative
that looks like You're at

584
00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:52.790
the beginning of the grind
on this one, because you've

585
00:28:52.790 --> 00:28:55.580
got a hundred or so
200 ratings as opposed to

586
00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:58.670
21,000. So it hasn't really
been discovered yet. Has it?

587
00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:02.450
So another, some more tips.
I love these steps. Okay.

588
00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:06.290
So one thing with the
ratings, your ratings reset whenever

589
00:29:06.290 --> 00:29:08.450
you do in your release.
And when I, what I

590
00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:10.640
mean by that is that
yeah, it gets archived, but

591
00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:13.880
the front page or the
app store page only shows

592
00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:17.300
the average, the current ratings
for your new app Website

593
00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:20.480
right here. And I see
current version 24 ratings, all

594
00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:25.160
versions in aggregate 183. Right?
Exactly. Exactly. So what happens

595
00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:28.160
is that when an ADR
released, I lost all the

596
00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:31.580
like 15,000 ratings that we
had and I was back

597
00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:33.410
to zero. Now, the good
news is that if you

598
00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:35.120
had a lot of bad
ratings, that's a great way

599
00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:38.330
to sell those under the,
under the rug. It's also,

600
00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:39.740
it's bad news. If you
have a lot of good

601
00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:42.990
names, good ratings, because get
settled in, I mean, you

602
00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:46.110
shouldn't necessarily be releasing every
week If you're low on

603
00:29:46.110 --> 00:29:49.860
the app store, go ahead
and Okay. But if your

604
00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:52.500
number one app, unless it's
a bug and really think

605
00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:54.750
about it, right, We didn't
touch the game for 18

606
00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:57.150
days. And that was frustrating.
So what happened though, was

607
00:29:57.150 --> 00:29:59.790
that we had all that
media coverage come in, you

608
00:29:59.790 --> 00:30:03.030
know, new Yorker, the new
Yorker contacted us Huffington post

609
00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:06.540
business, insider all. It was,
it was crazy. And we

610
00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:08.730
would do as many interviews
where we could. And then

611
00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:10.170
we got to a point
where we're like, why don't

612
00:30:10.170 --> 00:30:13.410
we just communicate directly with
the fans? So if you

613
00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:16.470
beat the game, you get
developer commentary from both Michael

614
00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:18.900
and I, and we have
an immediate, we have a

615
00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:22.230
direct tunnel and we're increasing
engagement. We have a direct

616
00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:24.480
tunnel to the fans. We
speak to them. We talk

617
00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:27.240
about the development of the
game, both of our stories,

618
00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:30.780
who we are in audio,
or in text, audio game,

619
00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:33.840
in audio, You win the
game. It was just entirely

620
00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:37.080
text-based. And it unlocks a
special world where I can

621
00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:40.200
have you talking in the
background and giving me like

622
00:30:40.210 --> 00:30:43.830
a commentary track, like a
DVD. Yes, exactly. And then

623
00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:45.840
in the, at the end
of that commentary tack, we

624
00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:48.720
request that you write the
game. And then on top

625
00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:50.880
of that, we, I have
a plug in there for

626
00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:53.640
the incident and he's got
a, I've got a plug

627
00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:55.500
in there for gridline his
new game that he's built.

628
00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:57.660
Michael's new game that he's
built and that's web based

629
00:30:57.660 --> 00:31:00.120
right now, but he's working
on maybe doing a Kickstarter

630
00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:03.300
for another game, but that's
how we increase engagement. We

631
00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:05.070
were to the point, it's
like, well, this isn't, this

632
00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:07.020
is in the hands of
a million people. Why don't

633
00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:09.810
we talk directly to them?
I mean, that's, it's so

634
00:31:09.810 --> 00:31:12.420
easy. You know, there's a,
there's a really great article

635
00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:14.100
that I read recently, and
I'm going to put links

636
00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:16.380
to everything, including Michael's new
game and both of your

637
00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:19.680
games on the show notes.
And this article was called

638
00:31:19.770 --> 00:31:23.970
1000 true fans. Have you
familiar with this article? The

639
00:31:23.970 --> 00:31:26.070
idea is, if you are
a creative, I'm using a

640
00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:28.800
musician, a game maker, an
artist, what you need are

641
00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:32.250
a thousand true fans, capital
T capital F. And what

642
00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:33.810
you need those fans to
do is give you a

643
00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:37.620
hundred dollars a year and
a hundred dollars a year

644
00:31:37.770 --> 00:31:40.140
times a thousand people, you
get a hundred thousand dollars

645
00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:42.360
and you can have a
very, very comfortable life. So

646
00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:45.240
if they buy $1,100 of
anything from you, whether it

647
00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:48.030
be t-shirts or swag or
games, or in app purchases

648
00:31:48.030 --> 00:31:52.200
or mugs, whatever, you just
need a thousand. Right. I

649
00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:54.630
think that's a really interesting
idea. The technique that we

650
00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:56.880
used was that in, in
the game itself, we just

651
00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:59.100
request, look, the game's a
dollar. If you pay, if

652
00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:01.590
you feel that you've underpaid,
just gift the game to

653
00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:03.690
someone else. Cause it's so
easy to go into the

654
00:32:03.690 --> 00:32:06.390
app store, go to the
share button and gift any,

655
00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:09.450
any app. That is a
really great idea. So you're

656
00:32:09.450 --> 00:32:11.670
basically saying, Hey, you love
the game. You want to

657
00:32:11.670 --> 00:32:14.520
give us a pile of
money. Don't give a friend

658
00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:18.570
the game. Right, right. That's
really cool. And a couple

659
00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:20.250
of my associates, they're like,
I put a dollar on

660
00:32:20.250 --> 00:32:22.560
the table and say, buy
this game and they won't

661
00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:24.120
take the dollar. Right. They'll
just go in and buy

662
00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:26.340
the game. But the fact
that someone would go out

663
00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:28.830
of their way to say,
here's a dollar buy the

664
00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:31.980
game. They wouldn't say, okay,
I'll just buy the game.

665
00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:34.560
You have, you know, that
word of mouth is so

666
00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:37.800
powerful. So, so powerful. Very
cool. Well, this is really

667
00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:39.350
exciting to talk to you
and thanks for being so

668
00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:42.800
transparent and really giving people
who were thinking about getting

669
00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:44.810
involved or maybe are in
the app store right now

670
00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:47.120
and insight into what a
number one game looks like

671
00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:49.250
when a, when they're not
necessarily one of them, number

672
00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:51.880
one themselves. Right. So I
have a shotgun list of

673
00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:54.370
like tips. Let's hear if
you've got them. Okay. That'll

674
00:32:54.370 --> 00:32:57.730
be our closer. All right.
So your ranking is completely,

675
00:32:58.060 --> 00:33:00.490
completely based on the number
of downloads. It's a four

676
00:33:00.490 --> 00:33:02.860
day moving average. All right.
So that's, that's kind of

677
00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:04.630
like your baseline. If you,
if you have a good

678
00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:07.440
four day moving average and
it's not spikes, it's, it's

679
00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:11.860
consistent. That will help you
ranking, okay. Reviews are sorted

680
00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:14.770
by the number of stars
and by link. So if

681
00:33:14.770 --> 00:33:17.440
you have a five star
review, that's really long. That's

682
00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:19.840
awesome. But if there's a
one star review that rant,

683
00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:22.780
that's bad news. If it's
a, if it's a one

684
00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:24.700
star review, that's really short,
it will be lower on

685
00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:27.010
the rank. So it's ranked
by five star and then

686
00:33:27.010 --> 00:33:30.430
LinkedIn, then there's some threshold
where, where the, the length

687
00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:33.070
of review will Trump, the
number of stars that are

688
00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:36.660
in there. Okay. Okay. So
the top five apps in

689
00:33:36.670 --> 00:33:39.670
the paid section are, are
averaging about 5,000 downloads a

690
00:33:39.670 --> 00:33:44.590
day. Okay. The top five
apps in the free section

691
00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:48.040
are, are averaging 10 times
that so 50,000 downloads a

692
00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:51.160
day. So it's a, it's
an order of magnitude for,

693
00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:53.950
for those things. So just
be aware of that, your

694
00:33:53.950 --> 00:33:57.040
review conversion rate one to
2%. So if you look

695
00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:58.510
at the apps in the
app store and they have

696
00:33:58.510 --> 00:34:00.790
a review me button in
their app, you can kind

697
00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:03.280
of gauge how many total
downloads they have based on

698
00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:05.890
the number of reviews they
have. Just multiply that by

699
00:34:05.890 --> 00:34:07.810
a hundred and you get
a good feel for what

700
00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:10.360
they have. Timing releases important.
If you're a number one

701
00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:13.960
app don't release. If you're,
if you're lonely app store,

702
00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:17.350
just, just release often and
pick the perfect moment to

703
00:34:18.010 --> 00:34:20.890
display the review button, don't
nag them, pick that perfect

704
00:34:20.890 --> 00:34:25.030
moment, increase engagement. And that
purchases don't do the remove

705
00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:27.520
ads in that purchase. Do
the one that lets you

706
00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:30.850
have a cool, awesome stuff.
Add mops. You're looking at

707
00:34:30.850 --> 00:34:34.720
15 cents per click through anywhere
from a 25% to 85%

708
00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:38.020
click through rate. So think
about that. A trademark issues

709
00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:41.260
and clones. If you get
to that point, that's a

710
00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:43.540
good problem to have, and
you just have to deal

711
00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:46.210
with it. It's not easy,
but it is what it

712
00:34:46.210 --> 00:34:49.990
is. A media coverage. Doesn't
help. It's the word of

713
00:34:49.990 --> 00:34:52.570
mouth that helps so much
more than media coverage. I've

714
00:34:52.570 --> 00:34:56.440
actually for Twitter, every 10,000,
if someone with 10,000 followers

715
00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:58.900
retweets about your game or
tweets about your game, you

716
00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:01.840
can expect five to 10
downloads. So if someone at

717
00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:04.660
a hundred thousand followers, you're
going to get X number

718
00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:07.600
of downloads based on that.
Okay. That's kind of how

719
00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:10.960
I've averaged that out to
engagement and personal connection are

720
00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:13.510
the most important thing you
find that like, like you

721
00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:16.180
said, you find is at
a thousand fans and you

722
00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:18.640
engage with them that you
connect with them on a

723
00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:21.820
personal level. They'll love you
for that. A UK, U

724
00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:25.690
S is the largest market,
UK, Australia, and Canada, or

725
00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:32.050
a fifth, the size they're
the next largest markets. Let's

726
00:35:32.050 --> 00:35:35.860
see engagement on a personal
level pricing on your, on

727
00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:37.830
your, on your app. Set
it at a, if you're

728
00:35:37.830 --> 00:35:38.970
going to do a paid
up, is that at a

729
00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:41.670
high price, like one 99,
two 99. In fact, play

730
00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:43.380
around with your prices. If
you're at the top of

731
00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:47.160
your category, increase the price
because the chances of you

732
00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:50.550
making the top of overall
is very hard. If you're

733
00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:52.260
at the top of your
category, go ahead and increase

734
00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:54.450
the price, play around with
it until you find a

735
00:35:54.450 --> 00:35:58.650
good plasticity to it. I
guess less density ratio sales

736
00:35:58.650 --> 00:36:01.650
are good. There's so many
syndications out there that will

737
00:36:01.650 --> 00:36:04.860
actually pick up the sale
and advertise for you. I've

738
00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:07.470
gotten a ton of downloads
by setting the price to

739
00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:09.510
a one 99 and then
dropping it down to it

740
00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:11.690
all. You can't do it
too often, but that's a

741
00:36:11.690 --> 00:36:15.060
T that's a technique that
you can use. When I

742
00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:17.430
was at number one in
the app store on the

743
00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:21.300
top grossing apps, I was
number 83. So that puts

744
00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:24.180
into perspective. How many, how
many other apps, the AAA

745
00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:29.100
titles, what, they're, what they're
actually making Minecraft. If you're

746
00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:32.370
gonna do Minecraft, I kinda
did the averages at 10,000

747
00:36:32.370 --> 00:36:35.700
downloads a day, 365 days
at seven bucks, a pop

748
00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:41.670
you're making 25 million annually. And
they're the number 28 top-grossing

749
00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:44.150
app. So that puts into
perspective what the, what the

750
00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:48.120
number one app, the top
grossing app makes it's massive,

751
00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:50.070
massive amounts of money. And
of course, this is all

752
00:36:50.070 --> 00:36:53.670
like speculation based on what
I've, what I've observed. And

753
00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:58.530
then curve drops very quickly
and drops extremely quickly. The

754
00:36:58.530 --> 00:37:02.730
number one apps they have,
they're making huge amount of

755
00:37:02.730 --> 00:37:05.340
money. And then the difference
between like the one 50

756
00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:09.270
and one 51 could be
a few dollars. Fantastic. I

757
00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:11.400
hope so. I hope you're
going to write that summary

758
00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:14.820
up on your, your developer
blog. And we will send

759
00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:16.770
everyone there from the show
notes. So they get all

760
00:37:16.770 --> 00:37:19.500
the details and the great
summary of all these tips.

761
00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:22.620
There you go. Thanks so
much. This has been another

762
00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:25.110
episode of Hanselminutes and we'll
see you again next week.

763
