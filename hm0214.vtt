episode, Scott talks with Gary Schmidt

7
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.290
about being active with type
one diabetes. Hi, this is

8
00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.690
Scott Hanselman, and this is
another episode of Hansel minutes.

9
00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.260
And today I'm chatting with
Gary Schmidt. Gary is a type

10
00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.130
one diabetic like myself, and
he is also a incredibly

11
00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.280
fit individual. He's a triathlete.
And I thought it would

12
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.920
be interesting to have him
on the show because I

13
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.460
used to be fit and
then became diabetic and Gary

14
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.310
is diabetic and is fit
and he must know something.

15
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.070
I don't know. So thanks
so much, Gary, for coming

16
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.040
on the show and helping
me figure this out. No

17
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.680
problem, Scott. Thanks for having
me. So how long have

18
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.960
you been diabetic? I was
diagnosed in December of 2002,

19
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.220
so just a little over
seven years. Okay. And how

20
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.170
old were you when you,
when you were diagnosed at

21
00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.520
28, 28. So give us
the, give us the story

22
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.350
a little bit and remember
that we've got a lot

23
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.100
of international listeners and we've
got a lot of non

24
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.570
non-diabetic. So talk a little
bit about when you were

25
00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.880
diagnosed and what you thought
and the different kinds of

26
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.160
diabetes and whether or not
it was unusual for this

27
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.730
to happen to you at
28. Yeah, sure. Yeah. So

28
00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.200
it was a fall of
2002, and I had a

29
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.110
lot of the same symptoms
that a lot of other

30
00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.890
folks that get diagnosed with
this, have I, all of

31
00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.870
a sudden I was thirsty
all the time. I was

32
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.810
really tired. I had to
go to the bathroom all

33
00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.270
the time, had urinate all
the time and my vision

34
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.360
got really blurry and I
had always had really good

35
00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.430
vision. So it was kind
of bothered me a little

36
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.130
bit. So I had all
these kinds of things and,

37
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.620
and, and then over the
course of just a couple

38
00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.790
of weeks, I lost about
20 pounds and I'm, I'm

39
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.160
65 and I weigh about
200 pounds. So I dropped

40
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.770
down to about one 80,
really, really fast. And I

41
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.890
remember I was at work
one day and went to

42
00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.330
the restaurant work and looked
in the mirror and I

43
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.660
thought to myself, I'm dying.
I really had no idea

44
00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.130
what was going on at
all. So finally made appointment

45
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.020
to go see my doctor.
And at this point, my

46
00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.820
vision had started to kind
of go back to normal.

47
00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.210
So I thought maybe things
were going to be fine.

48
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.810
Went visited him. They did
some tests. And then a

49
00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.910
few days later was talking
on the phone with the

50
00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.060
doctor's nurse, and then I'm
trying to figure out, figure

51
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.610
out what the diagnosis was.
And she said that the

52
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.390
doctor say anything about diabetes,
and I didn't know anything

53
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.600
about diabetes at all. And
I thought it was kind

54
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.180
of a immediate death sentence.
So I quickly did some

55
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.390
research and, and learn that
that wasn't necessarily the case.

56
00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.440
I was initially diagnosed with
type two, which is something

57
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.550
that happens a lot to
adults that are diagnosed kind

58
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.720
of later on in life
with type one, you know,

59
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.490
and I wasn't the, you
know, the typical kind of

60
00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.850
person that would have type
two, you know, the typical

61
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.450
kind of overweight, maybe kind
of person. So it was

62
00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.440
kind of odd diagnosis, but,
but through diet and exercise

63
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.150
and some oral medications, I
was able to control it

64
00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.840
for a while, but then
eventually I wasn't able to

65
00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.020
control that. And I went
to a dietician to try

66
00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.160
to get some help, to
try to see what I

67
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.470
could do with my diet.
And she asked me what

68
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.560
kind of insulin I was
on and I wasn't on

69
00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.350
insulin. So soon after that,
she kind of put me

70
00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.580
in touch with another doctor,
an endocrinologist, and he, you

71
00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.130
know, quickly diagnosed me as
type one, meaning that my

72
00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.620
body does not produce insulin
at all, meaning that I

73
00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.050
would be, I'd have to
produce my own insulin or,

74
00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.150
you know, I'd have to
take shots or some other

75
00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.370
way, like an insulin pump
only for the rest of

76
00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.590
my life. So, so it
was kind of a, it's

77
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.010
a normal thing. When I
talk to other adults that

78
00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.280
are diagnosed with type one
diabetes, they almost kind of

79
00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.290
go through the similar kind
of thing. I don't know

80
00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.060
Scott did. Is that kinda
the way it went with

81
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.210
you? Cause you were what,
21 when you, when you

82
00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:35.970
were Right. So I was
diagnosed in December, no, November

83
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.800
of my 20th year. So
when would it have been

84
00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:46.140
to 1994? Somewhere in there?
Yeah. Somewhere in December of

85
00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.060
94 and December 93, I'd
have to look it up.

86
00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.330
So it's been 15, 16
years at this point and

87
00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.400
I will, I'm about five
11. I like to say

88
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.580
I'm six foot, but I'm
five 11. And I went

89
00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:03.060
from about 180 pounds to
about one 41 45. Wow.

90
00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.180
I mean, I was just
hanging bones off of me

91
00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.650
and I was peeing all
the time. I was peeing

92
00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.230
constantly and I could not
believe how thirsty I was,

93
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.690
but you're on your end.
You're a young person. So

94
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.280
you just, what do you
do if you're thirsty when

95
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.640
you get some mountain Dew
and I was just to

96
00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.890
fish, to drinker, I would
have two liter bottles of

97
00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:26.460
mountain Dew in both hands
and just walk around drinking

98
00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.920
mountain Dew, figuring that I
just get enough. You know,

99
00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.040
I was dehydrated from my
point of view and I

100
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.100
drank an obscene amount of
mountain Dew and got, and

101
00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.160
kind of, I basically turned
to gray. My body turned

102
00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.710
gray. And for the people
who are listening, who haven't

103
00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.140
quite got the context yet,
there's two kinds of diabetes.

104
00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:45.660
There's there's type one and
there's type two type one,

105
00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:50.550
diabetics produce no insulin. And
they are literally missing something

106
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.930
while type two diabetics are
resistant to their own insulin

107
00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:58.580
effectively. They've basically use the
drug so much that they

108
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:05.000
are, they are resistant to
it. And most people overseas

109
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.490
think of this as, as
a juvenile diabetes and an

110
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.560
adult diabetes. And that sounds
like what happened to you

111
00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.620
that even your, your doctor
here in the U S

112
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.860
just assumed while you're, you're
almost 30. So you must

113
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.890
be the old guy diabetes
and not the young guy

114
00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:22.950
diabetes, but that seems to
have changed. And actually I

115
00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.480
had two different doctors at
that time. I, the one

116
00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:28.060
that diagnosed me and then
we actually moved and I

117
00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.790
had a different doctor and
this new doctor, you know,

118
00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:33.130
I was type two. You
know, it didn't even occur

119
00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:35.140
to him that I might
not be type two. So

120
00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:38.410
I had, I had to,
you know, normal primary care

121
00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:42.760
physicians that completely missed it.
And this is the struggle

122
00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.820
with diabetics is that there's,
you're in the States. Of

123
00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:49.330
course the primary care physician
is really a general practitioner.

124
00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:52.570
And then there's the notion
of an endocrinologist. And, you

125
00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:54.400
know, if you break a
bone, you usually go to

126
00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.320
a specific kind of person
to have that looked at.

127
00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:57.640
And if you have a
heart attack, you go to

128
00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.400
a specific kind of person.
But if you're feeling sick

129
00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.690
all the time at P
and all the time, you

130
00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:04.060
go to your regular doctor,
and if they think they

131
00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.190
can fix it with a
pill, they'll, you know, they'll

132
00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:10.090
try to do that. And
unfortunately that for diabetics, we

133
00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:13.060
can spend years, even I
spent a year and a

134
00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:16.300
half as, as a 20
year old diagnosed as a

135
00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:19.390
type two diabetic, which didn't
make any sense. I didn't

136
00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:22.030
have any of the symptoms,
but that, that, that looked

137
00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:24.340
like type two diabetes. And
I ended up taking pills

138
00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:26.560
for awhile, just like you
did. And it's tragic because

139
00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:31.420
the time that I wasted
doing that was, And so,

140
00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.840
so initially your, your body
is, is still working. It's

141
00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:37.390
still producing some insulin. And
then over the course of,

142
00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.670
you know, whatever it is,
I was probably the same

143
00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:41.590
way a year, year and
a half, something like that,

144
00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.170
all of a sudden you're
then you just kind of,

145
00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:47.440
it stops. And then it
takes a long time to

146
00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:49.330
really get to the point
where I guess you're not

147
00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:53.260
producing any. So, you know,
you start out with having

148
00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.950
to use very little insulin
and then gradually started using

149
00:07:56.950 --> 00:08:00.130
more and to kind of
level out. Right. And because

150
00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:02.650
we don't produce any insulin
folks who are listening, we,

151
00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:04.660
we have to bring it
in. We have to get

152
00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:07.750
that insulin in. So it
sounds you're you're Gary's doctor

153
00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:10.720
was saying, I think that
you have insulin in you.

154
00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.610
You're just not using it
very well. So we'll give

155
00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:15.880
you pills that will make
it work better. And then

156
00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:17.620
when you ran out, when
you find, when your pancreas

157
00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:20.140
finally gave up the ghost,
did they put you immediately

158
00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:21.820
on shots? And did you
have to go and learn

159
00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:27.280
the whole? Yeah. Yeah. I
was starting to took Lantis,

160
00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:31.990
which is a long acting
insulin that generally covers like

161
00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:34.750
12 to 24 hours, something
like that. And then to

162
00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:39.010
cover my meals, I use
an insulin pen. So just

163
00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:42.190
as a little, it looks
like a pen, a little

164
00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:44.800
needle with some insulin loaded
in it. And then you

165
00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:48.430
dial up the amount of
insulin for the number of

166
00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:49.990
carbs you're going to eat.
So if I'm going to

167
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:54.040
eat, I dunno, say 15
grams of carbs or something

168
00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.640
like that. I would, that
kind of equates to one

169
00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:58.650
unit of insulin. So I
dial it up on a

170
00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:02.280
pen, can myself that one
injection and then away I

171
00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:06.710
went. And that, that ratio
that you just mentioned is

172
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:10.940
so important. Diabetes is surprisingly
about a math, isn't it?

173
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.040
I mean, you just find
yourself doing all sorts of

174
00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.050
math in your head that
you would never think about.

175
00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.970
Yeah, absolutely. You know, if
you're doing multiple daily injections.

176
00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:23.360
Yeah. There's, there's a lot
of math, fortunately, you and

177
00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:26.750
I both use an insulin
pump, which it does a

178
00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:29.780
lot of that thinking for
us. One of the good

179
00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:31.850
things with the insulin pump
is that you can set

180
00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:36.020
different ratios throughout the day.
You'll you'll find, I know,

181
00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:37.670
I know I do. I'm
not sure if you do

182
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:39.620
Scott, but throughout the day,
I have to use different

183
00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:44.420
ratios to cover my meals.
So, so the pump helps

184
00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:45.650
a little bit with that.
I don't know if you

185
00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:47.460
want to talk about the
pump a little bit. Well,

186
00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:50.210
I do. So you, you
used needles for a while

187
00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:53.870
and I did too. I
spent five years sticking myself.

188
00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:55.670
And initially when they teach
you this, they tell you

189
00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:57.050
to just do it a
couple of times a day,

190
00:09:57.290 --> 00:10:01.490
morning and night. And I
realized pretty quickly, somewhere in

191
00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:05.210
the first three years, that,
that as well, as much

192
00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:09.380
as my doctor was a
good person and appreciated, and

193
00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:12.170
I appreciated their effort. They
were not going to care

194
00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:14.480
about me 24 hours a
day. And no one was

195
00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.040
going to take care of
me except myself. And I

196
00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:20.240
think that most diabetics come
to that realization. Right? Absolutely.

197
00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.150
So then I said, I
gotta get this figured out.

198
00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:25.960
And someone suggested a pump.
How long do you got

199
00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:30.380
upon a pump? It was,
I don't know, probably a

200
00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:32.230
year and a half or
two years. I think. Not,

201
00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:35.630
not too long. One of
the biggest things for me

202
00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:39.170
was when I was just
giving myself injections, I kind

203
00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:42.410
of felt like, you know,
okay, here's my meal, give

204
00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:45.590
myself an injection. And then
I'm sort of not diabetic

205
00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:47.480
for a little while until
I have to do it

206
00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:50.960
again. When I was trying
to decide whether or not

207
00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.480
to go into the pump,
I'm hooked to this thing

208
00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:56.930
24 seven. And so, so
again, it took me a

209
00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:59.270
little bit to kind of
get over that. It's like,

210
00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:02.120
you know, now it's like,
I'm always diabetic. So it's

211
00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:05.180
kind of a weird thing
now of course, after using

212
00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:07.820
it for a while, you
realize, you know, at least

213
00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:09.110
for me is the way
to go. And I can't

214
00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:12.110
imagine living without it, but
it definitely was a big

215
00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:16.370
change for me. Yeah. There's
a psychological thing. I remember,

216
00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:19.400
I think I was 25
and they, and the pump

217
00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:22.610
educator came in and this
is a registered nurse. Who's

218
00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:24.770
there to teach you how
to use this pump and

219
00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:27.050
the pump. I've got a
video up that I'll put

220
00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:28.970
in the show notes that
I, I show people how

221
00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:33.170
I plug my pump in.
And it basically plugs into

222
00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:35.240
us. You know, I keep
mining for about three to

223
00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:38.000
six days basically until I
run, run out of insulin

224
00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:40.640
and it pushes the insulin
into you. So you don't

225
00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:43.580
have to stick yourself all
the time. But man, when

226
00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:45.470
she came and taught me
how to use it, I

227
00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:48.560
broke down. I started crying
because I just realized that

228
00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:51.260
I've suddenly, I've sit in
here with an external organ

229
00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:55.840
that I can't afford lose.
It was very psychologically difficult.

230
00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:00.720
Yep. Absolutely. It's just, it's
hanging off of you every

231
00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:04.350
day, all day. It was
a big change, but I

232
00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:06.870
think it's a great tool
that we get to use.

233
00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:09.330
And we're very fortunate that
we have that at our

234
00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:13.260
disposal. Now, were you physically
fit when you became diabetic

235
00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:15.060
or wouldn't come in? I
mean, how did you go

236
00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:18.150
from diabetic to triathlete? Because
I find I've got to

237
00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:21.300
be, this makes it difficult
for me to exercise. Yeah.

238
00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:23.910
It, it, it definitely is
a challenge. And I, I

239
00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:27.210
think, you know, growing up,
I was always very athletic,

240
00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:31.050
probably near the time I
was diagnosed. I was not

241
00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:36.690
quite as, as athletic. I
started actually getting back into

242
00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:40.800
it after I was diagnosed.
So it's a way to

243
00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:44.830
help me. It helps you
use the insulin better. It

244
00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:48.630
it's really hard. It's a
real challenge. There's a lot

245
00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:49.800
of stuff that I have
to deal with on a

246
00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:53.640
daily basis that other folks
don't have to, but in

247
00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:58.560
the long run, the benefits
definitely outweigh all of the

248
00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:02.940
trouble that it causes and
all the challenges. One of

249
00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:06.150
the metrics that I use
that is like the actually

250
00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:08.910
it's really become my primary
metric 15 years into it

251
00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:11.430
now is the total amount
of insulin that I use

252
00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:15.600
in a single day. And
that total amount I feel

253
00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:17.970
like tells me how I'm
doing as a, as a

254
00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:23.220
diabetic. And I started out
using about 20 units of

255
00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:26.160
insulin a day, total when
I was very, very thin

256
00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:29.280
and very young, 15 years
ago. And then I used

257
00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:32.550
30 units a day total.
So that's, that's complete usage

258
00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:35.820
of insulin every single day.
And then in the last

259
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.610
two or three years, it's
gone up to 40 units

260
00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:42.480
a day. Do you think
about things in that context

261
00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:46.560
and has exercise changed that
I was actually just trying

262
00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:48.150
to look at my pump
to see what my numbers

263
00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:50.820
are. I don't know. I
think that, I think it

264
00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:52.770
is, I'm talking about like
in the larger macro scope,

265
00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:54.870
like five years ago, did
you use less or more?

266
00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:59.040
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah. Hmm. I don't know.

267
00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:02.130
I think I've probably used
a little bit less, but,

268
00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:03.900
but then again, I, I
don't know. I think I'm

269
00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:06.540
still towards maybe the tail
end of the honeymoon phase.

270
00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:10.440
So, you know, five years
ago, I probably wasn't using

271
00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:12.210
very much at all, but
I, I would think that

272
00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:17.370
since I've been exercising and
running and doing triathlons, the

273
00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:19.830
amount of insulin that I,
my, you know, my daily

274
00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:22.390
amount has definitely gone down.
And I think if we

275
00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:26.160
eliminate that, I think it's
a good thing. And the

276
00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.260
honeymoon period that you just
referred to, what is the

277
00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:32.670
honeymoon period? It's just the,
the amount of time from

278
00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:36.290
when you know, your, your
pancreas is producing insulin and,

279
00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:38.580
and doing what it's supposed
to do that kind of

280
00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:42.630
tapers off over a period
of time. And so over

281
00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:44.880
a period of time, you'll
need less or more and

282
00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:49.680
more insulin from the pump
or from a syringe to,

283
00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:54.340
to help make up for
that deficiency. Hey, it's alternate

284
00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:57.790
universe, Scott Hanselman going to
thank our sponsors for making

285
00:14:57.790 --> 00:14:59.860
this free show possible. We've
been doing Hansel minutes for

286
00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:01.810
almost four years now, and
we really couldn't do it

287
00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:03.640
without Tellerik. So I want
to tell you about some

288
00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:05.800
of the stuff they're working
on. If you've already started

289
00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:09.220
developing with Silverlight and you'll
probably need a solid testing

290
00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:11.830
tool to do your several
at UIs, unfortunately though, a

291
00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:13.900
lot of the tools available
today only help you with

292
00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:16.480
unit testing. There's not really
a good way to simulate

293
00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:19.120
the actual behavior of those
end users, unless you spend

294
00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.610
days and weeks doing a
lot of manual testing, but

295
00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:23.380
the guys at Tellerik, you've
got a new point and

296
00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:26.560
click UI testing tool for
server line called web UI

297
00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:29.680
test studio. The beauty is
that you can quickly record

298
00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:33.220
your tests with a cross-browser
recorder. You can enrich them

299
00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:36.040
with code if you've got
really complex scenarios. And on

300
00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:38.200
top of that, it supports
all the standard controls, as

301
00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:41.440
well as the Tellerik enhanced
controls. You can verify not

302
00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:45.100
only several lines, but even
complex Ajax applications, best part

303
00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:48.100
web UI test studio lives
in visual studio. So you

304
00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:51.280
don't have to leave your
favorite development environment. You check

305
00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:56.140
it out at tellerik.com/web hyphen
testing, hyphen tools, and be

306
00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:58.120
sure to thank Tellerik for
supporting the show on their

307
00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:03.790
Facebook fan page at facebook.com/tellerik.
The honeymoon period is really

308
00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:09.070
painful from a it's really
painful because it's almost like

309
00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:12.400
the universe is teasing. You
I've seen a lot of

310
00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:17.680
people who have a child
get diagnosed with diabetes, and

311
00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:19.450
then they do, they do
everything right, and they go

312
00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:22.390
to all their classes and
then they take their insulin.

313
00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:25.960
And then one day they
don't need insulin for maybe

314
00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.390
three, four, five days, or
they start using tiny amounts

315
00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:30.850
of insulin and they think,
Oh, we've beat it. We

316
00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:33.760
figured it out. And that's
that? That's the honeymoon period

317
00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:39.160
where the body makes its
last gasp of a trying

318
00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:41.620
to fix it. And then
it finally, the pancreas gives

319
00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:44.860
it up. So when, when
we work out, your insulin

320
00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:48.940
is used more effectively. And
when you work out your

321
00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:52.030
blood sugar drops, I found
that the number one thing

322
00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:54.460
that can lower my blood
sugar is his yard work.

323
00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:57.010
And I'll literally, if I'm
going to have a low

324
00:16:57.010 --> 00:17:00.400
blood sugar, it will be
doing, doing yard work. The

325
00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:03.310
thing that I struggle with
when I'm exercising and with

326
00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:06.520
diabetes is that I sometimes
end up eating more food

327
00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:09.550
than I would have ordinarily
that day. So I don't,

328
00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:12.220
I didn't actually lose any
weight like in a regular

329
00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:13.870
day, if I don't work
out, I'm not going to

330
00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:16.930
have a power bar, but
if I work out and

331
00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:18.790
I have a low blood
sugar, there's no choice, but

332
00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:21.370
to, but to eat. And
then when you do the

333
00:17:21.370 --> 00:17:24.790
math and inevitably, I ended
up giving myself more food

334
00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:27.280
than I would have. How
can I work out and

335
00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:30.580
lose weight? And I keep
putting calories in myself. Yeah,

336
00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:34.060
it is. It's really tough.
There are those days if

337
00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:36.910
I have a hard workout
in the morning and I

338
00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:38.470
don't do kind of what
I need to do, and

339
00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:40.060
I'll talk about that a
little bit, you know, some

340
00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:41.770
of the things I need
to do to prevent the

341
00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:46.750
lows, you know, I'll find
myself thrown down two, three

342
00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:50.160
pop tarts, you know, especially
like on a Saturday, if

343
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.070
I'm out, you said doing
yard work or doing something

344
00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:54.110
like that, then I'm going
to have some more, I

345
00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:57.800
mean, I I'm, I'm eating
a lot of calories to

346
00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:01.010
try to, to, to fix
my lows. So it definitely

347
00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:04.070
is a challenge now, fortunately,
I don't know. I don't

348
00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:08.510
have that issue. I probably,
I eat a lot of

349
00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:10.220
things, calories, but I also
burn a lot of calories.

350
00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:12.290
So it's hard for me
to talk, talk to that,

351
00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:15.230
but I definitely see how
that's, that's an issue with

352
00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:18.800
somebody. And I think the
main thing is learn how

353
00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:23.180
to kind of control those
lows and identify some of

354
00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:26.900
the things that will make
you go low. Like you

355
00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:30.020
said, yard work. So let
me talk about a little

356
00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:32.000
bit about like what I'll
do for a normal day

357
00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:37.390
when I go running. But
the one thing that, the

358
00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:40.100
main thing, I guess, for
a type one, diabetic is

359
00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:42.680
paying attention to the amount
of insulin they have on,

360
00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:44.930
on board. And so that's
kind of the amount of

361
00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:48.290
insulin that's in your system.
So if you eat a

362
00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:51.650
big meal, give yourself 16
units of insulin, it's going

363
00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:55.100
to take anywhere three to
five, something like that hours

364
00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:58.370
for that insulin to kind
of go away. So what

365
00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:01.390
I have to be very
careful about is eating, giving

366
00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:03.020
myself a lot of insulin
and then going for a

367
00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:06.290
run. I just can't do
that. It's it would cause

368
00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:08.300
a big problem for me.
So I don't have the

369
00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:11.000
luxury like right now, I
couldn't go out and go

370
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.700
for a run. Cause if
I did my blood sugar

371
00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:17.300
would just tank. So I
have to prepare. So normally

372
00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:20.840
what I do, especially for
running two hours prior to

373
00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:23.750
Iran, I will lower my
Bazell amount. And I don't

374
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:26.240
think we've talked about what
nasal is, but basically the

375
00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:30.980
background insulin that's that's given
through the pump throughout the

376
00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:34.340
day. So it's just a
tiny amount of insulin all

377
00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:37.010
day long. And it's kind
of mimic sort of your

378
00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:40.160
body would normally do. So
the pump I have the

379
00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:42.980
luxury of, of BML being
able to dial that back.

380
00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:46.550
So two hours before I
run, I'll lower that by

381
00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:50.540
about 50%, maybe 40%. And
then I'll go for my

382
00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:54.290
run and that usually will
prevent, you know, I can

383
00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:55.970
go for an hour long
run and not have to

384
00:19:55.970 --> 00:20:00.320
eat anything during the run.
And I'll be okay right

385
00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:02.480
before the run, I do
eat about 20 or 30

386
00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:06.470
cars to kind of level
things out, but it says

387
00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:08.690
20, 30 carbs. That's like
a, you know, a granola

388
00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:11.300
bar or normally what I
do is like a peanut

389
00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:14.930
butter crackers or something like
that. Just something about, about

390
00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:17.450
five, 10 minutes before I
go out for a run.

391
00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:20.290
I found if I eat
it like right before run,

392
00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:23.060
it just doesn't seem to
do anything. If I wait

393
00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:25.730
too long, then my blood
sugar go high before I

394
00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:28.250
start. But by five or
10 minutes, I'll eat it.

395
00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:29.870
And then that usually will
cover me for an hour

396
00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:32.750
long run and I'll be
good to go. So that's,

397
00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:36.320
that's kinda my morning afterwards.
I don't really have to

398
00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:38.870
do anything special, but I
really have to watch myself

399
00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:41.750
later on in the day
when my body is trying

400
00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:45.560
to recover, it's going to
use upload lot of glucose

401
00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:48.850
and I have to lower
my basal again in the

402
00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:50.890
afternoon for two or three
hours, or I will go

403
00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:54.150
low in the afternoon. So,
and this is because of

404
00:20:54.150 --> 00:20:56.220
the morning run. So you
run at seven in the

405
00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:58.440
morning and you're going to
still be dealing with that

406
00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:00.990
at three in the afternoon.
Absolutely. Yeah. From, you know,

407
00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:05.730
from 8:00 AM till two or
so. I'm fine. But after

408
00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:09.030
that, I'll start to go
low. So yeah, so this

409
00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:11.670
presents a real challenge on
the weekends. So if I

410
00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:15.450
have a super long run
Sunday morning, if I get

411
00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:18.090
done at eight and then
I have to do, I'm

412
00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:19.500
going to do some yard
work or something like that

413
00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:22.920
in the afternoon, I got,
I got a real challenge

414
00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:25.680
because my body's already going
low. Now I'm going to

415
00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:28.050
do another activity. That's going
to cause me to go

416
00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:30.000
low. So this is, those
are the days where I

417
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.070
have a box of pop
tarts. Wow. Can you, can

418
00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:37.710
you talk a little about
what a low feels like

419
00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:40.770
to people a low, because
it's one of the most

420
00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:42.960
difficult things to explain. I
mean, my wife and I

421
00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:45.270
have been married 10 years
and I just, you know,

422
00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:46.800
and when I'm just kind
of lying on the ground,

423
00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:50.790
staring at the ceiling, just
wishing it would stop. She's

424
00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:53.370
really quite helpless. It's a
low is really a horrible

425
00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:58.500
thing, Right? Yeah. It's a,
you know, it's, unfortunately it's

426
00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:01.950
never the same thing, but
kind of a shaky feeling.

427
00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:06.630
You just, if I get
to some point where I'm

428
00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:10.440
pretty low, fairly low, too
low, I can't even think

429
00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:16.350
I can't form sentences. I
just can't do anything shaky.

430
00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:19.230
What are some of the
other things, I guess those

431
00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:22.740
are the main things. Sometimes
I've described people like, you

432
00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:25.470
know, when you're, when your
car is on E and

433
00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:26.910
you don't know if you're
going to make it to

434
00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:31.320
the next gas station and
it feels like the car

435
00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:33.660
that you're driving is starting
to pull the gas from

436
00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:36.090
like the really nasty bottom
part of the gas tank.

437
00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:39.600
And it sputters, it's like
the brain's version of it.

438
00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:45.150
Yeah, yeah. Just kinda, yeah,
weak and dizzy. And I

439
00:22:45.150 --> 00:22:48.540
don't know, it just, everything,
it really is awful. And

440
00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:52.170
it's one of the most
annoying things. And one of

441
00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:54.300
the few, the few times
that I kind of, you

442
00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:58.020
know, I really get upset
and just discouraged and just,

443
00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:01.860
Ugh, why now? That kind
of stuff. And on the

444
00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:05.700
flip side, there's, there's highs
and every diabetic is different,

445
00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:08.580
but you know, sometimes the
family will say, let's go,

446
00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:10.500
let's go for Chinese. And
I'll just say, you know,

447
00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:12.870
I just can't, I just
can't do Chinese food today

448
00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:16.230
because Chinese food is like
notoriously high in sugar, at

449
00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:19.440
least American Chinese food and
notoriously high in fat and

450
00:23:19.670 --> 00:23:22.650
high in carbs. And it's
just between pizza and Chinese

451
00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:26.790
food. There's just really nothing.
There's nothing good for a

452
00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:28.740
diabetic in those, in those
foods. And I'll end up

453
00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:31.980
having a high blood sugar.
How high do you go

454
00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:33.900
in an average week? I
mean, I'll hit two 50

455
00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:37.650
every week if only for
a couple of a couple

456
00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:41.310
of hours. Yeah. Yeah. You
know, I think I was,

457
00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:45.350
I was following you on
Twitter yesterday and you talking

458
00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:49.130
about a, a rollercoaster and
I was riding it with

459
00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:53.330
you yesterday. I swim in
the morning and, and had

460
00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:56.360
woke up with a blood
glucose of 90, which is

461
00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:59.950
great. Right. And the goal,
the goal is 80 to

462
00:23:59.950 --> 00:24:05.470
a hundred, 124 American milligrams
per deciliter. That's for those

463
00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:08.620
who are overseas, there's different
measurements like miles and kilometers,

464
00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:10.570
but we, we try to
keep our blood sugar around

465
00:24:10.570 --> 00:24:15.700
a hundred. Right. Right. So
after my swim, I was

466
00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:17.770
at a hundred great. And
one of the challenges I

467
00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:21.760
have a swimming is going
really high afterwards, especially if

468
00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:25.450
I'll try to eat a
snack afterwards or whatever, but

469
00:24:25.450 --> 00:24:29.080
I shot up to three
40 after my swipes. So

470
00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:31.750
everything, well, I think it
was a combination of the

471
00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:34.810
snack that I had afterwards.
I felt like I was

472
00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:36.940
a little bit low, but
I think I probably wasn't.

473
00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:41.140
So I didn't, I didn't
give myself a bolus. I

474
00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:43.150
didn't give us a very
good bolus for that meal

475
00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:47.560
and just give yourself any
insulin. Yeah. So I totally

476
00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:50.230
underestimated that and shot way
up for those who don't

477
00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:52.750
know what a bolus is.
I'm sorry. Yeah. It's explained.

478
00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:56.320
So we talk about basil
a minute ago and that

479
00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:58.600
is, you know, the little
bit of insulin throughout the

480
00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:01.450
day and bolus is the
other kind to, that. We

481
00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:05.650
take the fast acting to
cover meals that we eat.

482
00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:09.640
So, so, so I totally
blew it, you know, didn't,

483
00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:12.160
didn't guess the right number
of carbs or anything like

484
00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:14.380
that. And I shot up.
So, and like you said,

485
00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:15.310
you know, I was able
to fix that and I

486
00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:19.870
came down fast, but the
fluctuations are, are very frustrating

487
00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:21.430
and, and just kind of
something that we have to

488
00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:23.470
deal with. I wish that
I could have tighter control,

489
00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:28.720
but there's a lot going
on with, with exercising and

490
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.490
trying to do all the
right things with eating and

491
00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:34.180
everything. And it's, it's a
challenge to, to try to

492
00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:37.540
keep it in the right
range. It's depressing because when

493
00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:40.060
you, when you're looking at,
I always, I always tell

494
00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:41.860
people that a low will
kill you a quick and

495
00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:44.410
a high I'll kill. You
slow absolutely. With a low

496
00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:47.140
you're, basically your airplane is
losing altitude and you're going

497
00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:51.250
to crash into the mountain,
but with a low it's,

498
00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:53.470
like your balloon is floating
away and you're all alone

499
00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:56.980
and you're flying through the
sky and no one can

500
00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:59.260
help. And you just have
to bring that balloon down

501
00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:02.080
slowly. But when you're up
there, it's just about the

502
00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:08.020
loneliest feeling. Yeah, absolutely. I,
I, my, my symptom, when

503
00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:10.150
I'm high as a, you
know, kind of sluggish, I

504
00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:13.750
can, I feel real achy
and tired and I kind

505
00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:15.850
of, I play little games
like, am I tired? Or

506
00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:18.070
am I high? Cause a
lot of times I can't

507
00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:24.100
tell the difference between the
two. Yeah. For me, I

508
00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:27.400
can almost taste the sugar.
I feel like I'm marinating

509
00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:29.710
in my own sugar. Like
I can taste it in

510
00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:33.880
my mouth. And I know
that, and I'll ask my

511
00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:37.480
wife if my breast smells,
because my breath will smell

512
00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:41.530
like candy, but I haven't
eaten any candy. And it's

513
00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:44.010
just such a, it's such
a difficult thing to, to

514
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:47.820
deal with. I, how, how
can I start getting, getting

515
00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:50.430
into, working out to the
level where you've actually done

516
00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:54.710
triathlons, right? Yeah. I am,
I've done a few shorter

517
00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:58.190
ones. I'm going to do
a half iron man, the

518
00:26:58.210 --> 00:27:02.630
September, which is the, the,
the 70 mile version. The

519
00:27:03.530 --> 00:27:07.490
1.2 miles swim, 56 mile
bike, and then a 13

520
00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:10.250
mile run. I haven't committed
to doing a full one

521
00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:14.840
yet, but I will, at
some point, you know, you

522
00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:17.030
gotta, you know, just make
the commitment to do it.

523
00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:20.900
You gotta start off slow,
just so you know, you're

524
00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:23.660
going to be going to
be running or whatever. You're

525
00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:25.580
going to be starting off
running just like anybody else.

526
00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:27.230
So you're going to use
the same kind of program,

527
00:27:27.530 --> 00:27:32.240
but the key really is
watching the amount of insulin

528
00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:33.800
that she had them on
board and, and lowering your

529
00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:38.750
basals beforehand, doing, you know,
testing before testing right after,

530
00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:42.530
during my longer runs I'll
test during like when I,

531
00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:44.930
I ran a marathon, I
ran Chicago marathon, my first

532
00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:49.190
one this past October. And
I tested about every five

533
00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:51.920
miles and about every five
miles, I, I kind of

534
00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:53.660
find out and I found
this out through my training,

535
00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:57.500
doing the exact same thing
about five miles. I know

536
00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:59.120
if I'm going to go,
you know, which way I'm

537
00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:01.820
going. And then about every
five miles I can either

538
00:28:02.270 --> 00:28:05.810
I can eat something maybe
at the next aid station

539
00:28:05.810 --> 00:28:08.630
I'll take, you know, just,
just water. If I figure

540
00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:10.460
I'm going low, then I
can take some Gatorade or

541
00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:14.570
whatever. But, but that amount
of time was enough that

542
00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:16.670
I could make a decision.
And also, I also knew

543
00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:19.910
that in that amount of
time, I wasn't gonna go,

544
00:28:19.910 --> 00:28:22.520
I wasn't gonna dive down
or, you know, or go,

545
00:28:22.730 --> 00:28:24.800
go that direction. I knew
kind of where I was,

546
00:28:25.790 --> 00:28:30.200
but, but the keys are
lowering your Bazell beforehand. You're

547
00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:32.240
gonna, you have to find
out what works best for

548
00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:36.080
you. And then during the
exercise you're going to have

549
00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:40.850
to test before, during, after.
And then also, as I

550
00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:42.470
talked about just a little
bit ago, you know, later

551
00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:45.530
on the day, what happens.
And the other thing, if

552
00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:50.090
you're just starting out, you're
probably gonna have more lows

553
00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:52.880
when you're just starting out
a new exercise, but once

554
00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:55.580
your body gets used to
that exercise things a level

555
00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:59.360
out. So even now I've
been at this for going

556
00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:03.170
on two, three years, I've,
I've found that now I'm

557
00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:06.050
actually using a little bit,
you know, I, I don't

558
00:29:06.050 --> 00:29:08.450
have to lower it quite
as much as I did

559
00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:10.490
when I first started. So
probably just kind of getting

560
00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:12.650
used to it. So, so
again, it's, it's, it's still

561
00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:15.380
a kind of, it's a
different kind of honeymoon phase,

562
00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:18.080
but it still exists. But
I just want to make

563
00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:20.210
sure that people can kind
of visualize this. Are you,

564
00:29:20.210 --> 00:29:23.270
you're running and you're checking
your blood sugar while you

565
00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:26.510
run, or do you stop
and instant check? I, I

566
00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:28.730
stopped. I actually I've, I've
got a little, a little

567
00:29:28.730 --> 00:29:30.980
race belt and I, and
I have a, the Lancing

568
00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:33.860
device. I had the Lancing
device sort of like taped

569
00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:36.170
on the outside of this
thing. And then I have

570
00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:41.320
a, an ultra mini blood
glucose monitor with couple of

571
00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:43.540
test strips and a Ziploc
bag inside this little pouch.

572
00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:46.480
So as I'm running, I'll
load up a test strip

573
00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:48.520
and wait until it's ready
to go. They'll stop for

574
00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:52.090
a second prick my finger
test. And then away I

575
00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:55.060
go, so it doesn't take
too much time, but that's

576
00:29:55.090 --> 00:29:59.100
kinda the way I handle
it. Yeah. And so you're

577
00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:01.860
running, you're in your shorts,
you've got a belt on

578
00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:04.980
with your Lancet, your test
strips, your blood sugar meter,

579
00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:07.320
and you're wearing your pump
as well on, on a

580
00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:09.840
belt or some kind of
with your tubing and everything

581
00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:13.320
as well. Yes, absolutely. And
then I also have a

582
00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:18.090
couple goo, I like to
take their, and like energy

583
00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:21.630
gels. It's an energy gel.
So it's a really fast

584
00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:27.120
acting carbohydrate, essentially. I will
never ever leave the house

585
00:30:27.150 --> 00:30:30.660
without something like that on
me running. It's just, you

586
00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:33.630
know, if you're type one,
this is a must, she

587
00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:36.510
cannot go out without some
sort of carb on you.

588
00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:40.920
So, you know, if I
test, if I'm running a

589
00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:43.410
little bit low, I don't
like to let myself get

590
00:30:43.410 --> 00:30:46.290
too low. If I'm out
for a run, you know,

591
00:30:46.410 --> 00:30:49.050
maybe one 20, one 30,
one 40, something like that.

592
00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:50.730
If I know if I'm
coming down, I'll go ahead

593
00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:53.700
and have a goo to
try to prevent myself from

594
00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:56.190
going too much lower. I
won't, I generally won't go

595
00:30:56.190 --> 00:30:59.370
back up, but if I
don't eat, I definitely will

596
00:30:59.370 --> 00:31:02.160
go down. So, but yeah,
so I have all that

597
00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:05.670
stuff with me. And this
is all with, you know,

598
00:31:05.690 --> 00:31:09.540
Laura, my basil two hours
before the night before, whenever

599
00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:11.460
I go to bed, I
own my insulin pump. You

600
00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:14.550
can set a Bazell pattern.
So I'll go ahead and

601
00:31:14.550 --> 00:31:17.460
set up my pump to
say, okay, at 4:30 AM, I

602
00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:19.680
need to start lowering it.
So there's a lot of

603
00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:22.650
preparation that goes into this.
This probably isn't the great

604
00:31:22.650 --> 00:31:26.250
effort, you know, the greatest
advertisement for, for exercising. But

605
00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:29.840
as I said before, the,
the benefits definitely outweigh all

606
00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:34.770
the challenges that we have.
Yeah. It's, it's, it's, it's

607
00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:37.380
funny though. There's so many
things that are intuitive to

608
00:31:37.410 --> 00:31:42.090
a diabetic that, that sounds
scary to regular folks. I

609
00:31:42.090 --> 00:31:44.070
mean, the idea that you
don't run, you don't leave

610
00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:47.660
the house without carbohydrates, right?
Oh, absolutely. I mean, I,

611
00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:49.620
I know like, you know,
the one time that I

612
00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:52.650
went to the blockbuster video
to rent a movie without,

613
00:31:52.650 --> 00:31:54.150
so that's, that's the time
I will have a low

614
00:31:54.150 --> 00:31:56.190
blood sugar and I'll find
myself sitting in the parking

615
00:31:56.190 --> 00:31:59.220
lot of a, of a
seven 11, just kind of

616
00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:02.940
like half crawling in to
get a PowerBar. That's just

617
00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:08.730
the Murphy's law of diabetes,
right? Yeah. You know, You

618
00:32:08.730 --> 00:32:10.200
know, it's scary, you know,
you're going out for a

619
00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:12.960
long run and you have
to be careful, or you

620
00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:16.950
will run into a serious
problem. You know, it's, it's

621
00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:21.360
very serious business, but it
can be done. And, you

622
00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:24.900
know, I, I'm a big
proponent of living life to

623
00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:27.720
the max. You know, I,
you know, I have this

624
00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:29.760
disease, it doesn't mean that
I can't go run a

625
00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:32.760
marathon. It doesn't mean that
I can't do other things.

626
00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:35.790
You know, it's just, you
know, it's the hand that

627
00:32:35.790 --> 00:32:37.290
I've been dealt and I
deal with it, you know,

628
00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:41.090
it's a Royal pain, the
butt, but, you know, that's

629
00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:42.650
just the way it is.
So, you know, I don't

630
00:32:42.650 --> 00:32:45.440
let it keep me down.
And, and that's, that's one

631
00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:47.990
of the big things that
kind of keeps me going

632
00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:51.890
and doing this is that,
you know, I've had parents

633
00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:54.650
of children with Tiwan that,
you know, that say that

634
00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:57.740
I'm an inspiration and that
just blows me away. I

635
00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:01.130
just can't even imagine that.
But you know, when I'm

636
00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:03.410
out there just for a
little run and I think,

637
00:33:03.410 --> 00:33:05.930
you know, I, I got
to push through this, you

638
00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:08.210
know, this is kind of,
one of the reasons I

639
00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:10.640
do this is to put
it out there and be

640
00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:13.160
an inspiration for other folks
that, you know, if you're

641
00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:15.140
diagnosed, that doesn't mean you're,
you just have to sit

642
00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:19.450
around and do nothing. There
really are no limitations. Yeah.

643
00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:22.150
I mean, it's all about
planning. I mean, you're, you're

644
00:33:22.150 --> 00:33:25.870
running marathons and triathlons and
I'm traveling all over the

645
00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:27.970
world crossing time zones and
you just do it. I

646
00:33:27.970 --> 00:33:29.050
mean, what else are you
going to do? You could

647
00:33:29.050 --> 00:33:34.060
sit at home, I suppose.
Yeah, exactly. So let's say

648
00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:35.380
that you thought it was
a question I, how to

649
00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:39.280
use Scott. So you've got
a big, big presentation that

650
00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:41.650
you're going to have to
get to, to give. Do

651
00:33:41.650 --> 00:33:45.850
you do anything different on
those kinds of days? Yeah,

652
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.350
I do. It's funny that
you mentioned that. I mean,

653
00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:49.570
giving a big presentation is
not exactly a half marathon,

654
00:33:49.570 --> 00:33:51.850
but like, let me give
you some examples. I was,

655
00:33:51.850 --> 00:33:54.700
I'm going to give a,
be a small part of

656
00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:57.280
a keynote, you know, and
you've got, you know, a

657
00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:00.190
couple of thousand people in
person and then maybe 20,

658
00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:03.580
30, 40,000 people watching online
and then maybe a half

659
00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:06.130
million. That'll watch it later.
It's not something you want

660
00:34:06.130 --> 00:34:10.900
to screw up. So non-diabetics
the night before, like, all

661
00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:12.340
right, you know, this is
great. We're going to be

662
00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:14.050
in this keynote. Let's all
like the whole team. Let's

663
00:34:14.050 --> 00:34:16.390
all go and have steak.
All right, let's go have

664
00:34:16.390 --> 00:34:19.300
steak and potatoes. We'll go
to like, Ruth's Chris steakhouse.

665
00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:22.330
And we'll just really like,
live it up and we'll

666
00:34:22.330 --> 00:34:23.740
all go to bed a
little early. Then I'll go

667
00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:25.930
to bed at 10 and
they'll wake up the next

668
00:34:25.930 --> 00:34:27.520
morning. It will be great.
So they're going to celebrate

669
00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:32.800
the night before by eating.
Right. And I'm, and so

670
00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:34.480
then I say, you know,
I'm going to go to

671
00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:37.420
subway, subway sandwiches. And I
go, what are you, what's

672
00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:38.380
wrong with you? Why are
you going to go to

673
00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:41.590
subway sandwiches? I mean, it's
like, well, tomorrow's important, right?

674
00:34:41.590 --> 00:34:45.430
It's the biggest day of
the year. And I know

675
00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:48.130
how many units of insulin,
a steak and cheese sandwiches,

676
00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:50.860
whether it's a steak and
cheese sandwich from subway that

677
00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:53.080
I buy in Amsterdam or
whether it's when I buy

678
00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:57.490
in Fargo, North Dakota. I mean,
I hope this sounds familiar

679
00:34:57.490 --> 00:34:58.930
to you and it's not
just me that does this.

680
00:34:59.410 --> 00:35:02.290
Oh, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. Especially
on those bigger kind of

681
00:35:02.290 --> 00:35:05.860
things. You just don't want
to take the risk. Yeah.

682
00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:09.520
I totally understand. You can't
go and have some crazy,

683
00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:12.940
Hey, let's try sushi the
night before a, I don't

684
00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:14.410
know what that'll do to
my blood sugar and while

685
00:35:14.410 --> 00:35:16.000
you're going to be asleep
at 10, I'm going to

686
00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.200
be up all night. Right.
Fighting, right. I mean, absolutely,

687
00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:23.140
absolutely Have a donut to
celebrate. Right. And if you

688
00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:25.390
look at a donut like
a crispy cream, not only

689
00:35:25.390 --> 00:35:27.970
is it horrible for you,
but I don't at nine

690
00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:31.060
o'clock, I'm going to be
wrestling with my blood sugar

691
00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:33.670
probably till two or three
in the afternoon for the

692
00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:37.000
pleasure of 30 seconds of
a donut. Absolutely. So I

693
00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:38.730
just don't do that. And
then people tease me. So

694
00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:40.320
I just lean into it,
you know, to be honest

695
00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:42.570
with you, I just lean
into it. I, I take

696
00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:45.390
that, you know, Hanselman flies
to Egypt and goes to

697
00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:49.740
subway kind of running joke.
And I just, I just

698
00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:51.540
say, yeah, well, yeah, you
know, of course I love

699
00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:54.270
subway, you know? I mean,
what else can you do

700
00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:56.070
other than joking, right. I,
yeah. I would love to

701
00:35:56.070 --> 00:36:00.420
have different food, but unless
I did all the math

702
00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:01.980
ahead of time, I just
don't know how I could

703
00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:05.070
do it without risking the
talk. Sometimes I'll even eat

704
00:36:05.070 --> 00:36:07.170
less. I mean, sometimes, you
know, it's really horrible thing

705
00:36:07.170 --> 00:36:09.360
to say, but sometimes it's
just easier not to eat.

706
00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:15.150
Yeah. You know, on, on,
on days that I'm exercising,

707
00:36:16.110 --> 00:36:18.540
you know, if I'm not
I'm training for triathlons. So

708
00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:22.410
I'll swim in the morning
and biking afternoon dealing with

709
00:36:22.410 --> 00:36:24.810
the whole insulin board issue.
I know swimming in the

710
00:36:24.810 --> 00:36:27.120
morning is fine, but then
if I'm going to bike

711
00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:29.790
around 12 or one, I
can't just have a big

712
00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:32.160
lunch at 11. I just
kind of have to take

713
00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:34.290
it easy. And I can't
give myself too much insulin

714
00:36:34.290 --> 00:36:36.570
or I'm going to have
issues on the bike. So

715
00:36:36.570 --> 00:36:39.090
by the time I'm done,
you know, biking at one

716
00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:42.620
or something like that, I
just want to eat. I,

717
00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:45.480
you know, it's just like,
you know, okay, the pressure

718
00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:47.040
is off a little bit.
Now I can, I can

719
00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:49.290
eat. I don't have to
worry about it so much,

720
00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:54.240
but yeah, you're right. Absolutely.
Well, and I think that's

721
00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:56.370
really where we can, where
we can kind of leave

722
00:36:56.370 --> 00:36:58.380
the conversation. I think you
nailed it right there. I

723
00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:01.230
mean, I just, I would
just like to eat just

724
00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:04.620
one day, whatever the heck
I want to, without thinking

725
00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:10.440
about it for six hours
afterwards. Absolutely. Yeah. Well, thanks

726
00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:12.300
a lot for coming on
and talking to me about

727
00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:14.700
this. I mean, I it's,
it's just nice to see

728
00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:17.940
people that, that can do
marathons and can do triathlons.

729
00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:20.460
And it reminds me that
I just need to get

730
00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:23.910
off my ass and I
thank you for that reminder.

731
00:37:23.970 --> 00:37:25.890
I really do. All right.
Thanks for having me, Scott.

732
00:37:25.890 --> 00:37:28.560
I appreciate it. This has
been another episode of Hansel

733
00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:36.350
minutes. So you, again, next
time <inaudible>.
