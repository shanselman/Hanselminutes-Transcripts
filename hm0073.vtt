two of his interns about
languages and the future of

10
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:07.010
engineering. Hi, this is Scott
Hanselman, and this is another

11
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.990
episode of Hanselminutes. And this
week we're going to be

12
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.960
talking with my interns. I
got an email from my

13
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.140
friend Scott bellwether, and he
said, put your interns on

14
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.790
the show. And he gave
me a list of some

15
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.950
questions, and I thought that
was a great idea. So

16
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.110
this year at Kirlian, we've
got two interns high school

17
00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.280
interns. Introduce yourself, sir. Shady
Glenn from tshirt high school.

18
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.630
How old are you? Shady
18. Okay. And other intern.

19
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.850
Hi, this is Eric and
I'm 17 and I'm going

20
00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.190
to be a senior at
West view high school. Okay,

21
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.440
cool. So you guys are
both seniors in high school

22
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.760
and you shady. You were
here last year. Yep. And

23
00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.190
Eric, this is Eric's first
year. This is my first

24
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.190
year having, having two interns.
And what did you work

25
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.740
on last year? Shady. Remind
us last year I worked

26
00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.000
with building a mobile banking
demo, a mobile demo. And

27
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.380
so you could bank from
a cell phone or a

28
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.130
mobile phone. Now you didn't
see sharp. And had you

29
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.680
ever done C-sharp before? Not
at all. So, I mean,

30
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.480
I was there, but you
know, tell the audience, I

31
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.910
was like, you're an intern.
Like what happened? You, you

32
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.790
arrived in that. I just
put really hard problems on

33
00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.880
your plate. I had to
solve a, what was it?

34
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.090
It was a word search
and I hadn't really worked

35
00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.970
with anything close to that
complex before I'd been working

36
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.550
with a visual basic and
just a little bit of

37
00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.520
Java. So C-sharp, I had
to completely learn that from

38
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.400
scratch pretty much. So remember,
the problem I gave you

39
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.580
was a, is a 230,000
word dictionary in a text

40
00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.370
file and then give you
a 50 by 50 grid.

41
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.340
And I said, basically, you
don't do the boggle go

42
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.920
up down, left, right. Diagonal.
And then I think after

43
00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.930
you got that, right. I
said, and backwards and diagonal

44
00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.140
it to go all the
different directions. I think. How

45
00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.390
fast did you end up?
How fast at the program

46
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.150
running the end? It didn't
run that fast. I think

47
00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.610
it took a minute to
get through it maybe. Yeah.

48
00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.400
So it was an algorithms
exercise, really? It wasn't right.

49
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.670
And mine wasn't effective. Then
you showed Me yours and

50
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.280
it was finished in like
15 seconds or something. Well,

51
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.760
that wasn't yeah, I showed
you mine, but yeah, absolutely.

52
00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.910
And then Eric, I gave
the same problem to you

53
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.680
and you had done some
work, some Java, but you're

54
00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.690
more of a PHP guy
if I remember correctly, right?

55
00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.450
Oh yeah. I don't, I
didn't really have that much

56
00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.380
experience with Java, but yeah,
I do PHP more and

57
00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.880
this is the first time
you learned C sharp as

58
00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.520
well. So I gave you
the same exact problem, except

59
00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.430
I learned from having you
shady as the intern last

60
00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.650
year. And here we did
a little more test driven

61
00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.820
development. And also I, Eric
had the benefit of a

62
00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.210
profiler. So we actually profiled
the code and sped it

63
00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.340
up. And I think it
ended up being a, I

64
00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.940
think it was around a
0.4 0.6 seconds. Yeah. So

65
00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.200
it was pretty good not,
and it wasn't trying to

66
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.480
like compare you guys to
each other, but no, it

67
00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.030
was, it was a situation
where the tooling really kind

68
00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.740
of made it possible for
us to see what was

69
00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.470
going on. And before I
was trying to make it

70
00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.360
simple, if I remember correctly,
I made you code in

71
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.780
notepad for awhile before I
gave you visual studio with

72
00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.300
Erica. Did it a little
differently. I don't know. I'm

73
00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.820
just learning as well as,
as you guys are now.

74
00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.250
Eric, how old were you
when you started using computers?

75
00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.720
Probably started using computers when
I was like eight or

76
00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.970
nine, probably on an old
Apple, really. And those Macintoshes

77
00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.570
with the green and black
really. And that's interesting. Cause

78
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.460
that's also one of the
computers that I worked on.

79
00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:24.300
Now. I am twice your
ages. I would have expected

80
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.580
that you would never have
seen an Apple before. And

81
00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.100
do you use those floppy
disks? Like five and a

82
00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.440
quarter inch floppies. Oh yeah.
We use those all through

83
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.500
grade school, grade school. I
think. I didn't see my

84
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.280
first Apple until a little,
a little later. And what

85
00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.800
about you Shay? Wow. I
started out when I was

86
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.000
about six, I think. And
we had a windows 3.1

87
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.390
machine and that was mainly
just playing some educational games.

88
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:50.730
Like I don't remember what
they were, but later it

89
00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:54.180
was a spelling jungle and
stuff like that. But then

90
00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.300
yeah, I saw, I had
seen an Apple when I

91
00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.100
was in, I went to
a private school for a

92
00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.260
couple of years and we
used, Did you immediately want

93
00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.180
to code on the thing
or was it just playing?

94
00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.680
It started Just playing. And
then I, after I got

95
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.160
into more games, more sophisticated
stuff, StarCraft and that, then

96
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.160
I just got into computers
and just continue going from

97
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.160
there and wanted to learn
how to make stuff. And

98
00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:18.450
was it gaming primarily that
got you working on the

99
00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:20.970
computer? Both of you guys.
I just liked it. The

100
00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.310
capabilities of what it could
do and yeah, but gaming

101
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.020
was definitely a big part
of it. What was your

102
00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.600
first email address? No. What
was it, but when was

103
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.620
it? Right? Cause I was
on the, I wasn't in,

104
00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.500
I mean, for those of
us who were around before

105
00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.390
that we had CompuServe. I
don't know if you ever

106
00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:36.150
saw that kind of stuff,
coffee. Sure. The original AOL

107
00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:41.040
before they had a windows
interface genie, there was one

108
00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.970
that Sears sold. I forgot
the name of the listeners

109
00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.010
will remember, but there's all
these different services that you'd

110
00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:50.280
use for dial up before.
Right? I had, it was

111
00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:52.200
a, when I got into
middle school, we actually started

112
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:56.130
needing internet for just school
projects and stuff, but it

113
00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.310
was through AOL prodigy. That
was what I was trying

114
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.370
to remember how to G
okay. No, it was through

115
00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.730
AOL on it. Sorry. Pretty
bad. Did. So your first

116
00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:08.260
address was an AOL address?
Yeah, mine was probably a,

117
00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.320
mine was probably a AOL
or Yahoo address. I don't

118
00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.660
quite remember that much. Do
remember what your first web

119
00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:18.310
browser was? What browser? Probably
AOL 5.0 or six point.

120
00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:22.810
Oh yeah. Now have you
ever seen like a, an

121
00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:25.120
old machine older than an
Apple? If you've seen any

122
00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.070
max you've seen punch card
machines, you're just, you know,

123
00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:32.470
you're saying The mainframe, I've
seen a typewriter, I electric

124
00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:34.930
typewriter or a typewriter with
actual, It was a manual

125
00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:37.600
typewriter. It was the ones
that like, if you type

126
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.520
the wrong key, I pretty
much have to redo the

127
00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.360
entire paper. Those kinds. Yeah.
They use white out to

128
00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.450
her parents kind of, yeah.
Now how I noticed that

129
00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:49.300
you've got a lot of
people on your chat is

130
00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.730
chat something that's kind of
instrumental to your life. I

131
00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:53.920
mean, you've got you chat
with people and ask questions

132
00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.170
or any of the people
on your team That programmers

133
00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:59.830
as well. I think I'm
probably one of the only

134
00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:04.300
programmers at my school. There's
one, there's one that graduated,

135
00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:06.190
but yeah, that's pretty much
it just me and him.

136
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.830
Wow. Now there's some talk
in the, in the, in

137
00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:10.660
the world and the community
right now that there's a,

138
00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:13.390
we're going to run out
of engineers. That there's a

139
00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:16.330
lot fewer people going into
school. And you just kind

140
00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:18.700
of, as a, as a
throwaway statement said that you

141
00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:20.380
don't know of a lot
of people at your school,

142
00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.950
Right? Code. Yeah. Why do
you think that is? I

143
00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:26.050
just think there's a lack
of interest in doing that

144
00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:30.160
or else it's probably a
little bit too complex for

145
00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.980
people to do. Huh? Do
you think it's a concern

146
00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:37.390
that there's a lot of
math Possibly. Yeah. You thought

147
00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:39.610
about a lot of math
while you've been here. Internship

148
00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:43.780
did use a lot of
math. I didn't really think

149
00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:46.390
it came as a, too
much of a whole problem.

150
00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:48.550
Okay. So it wasn't like
an oppressive amount of math.

151
00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:50.530
It's not like I'm asking
you to do equations. No,

152
00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:53.320
it's, it's pretty straightforward stuff.
Shady look like you've got

153
00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.510
a question or an opinion.
Yeah. Well, I think it's

154
00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:58.840
more of a lack of
opportunities actually, because at my

155
00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:01.180
school there's a bunch of
programmers just cause we have

156
00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:04.030
the opportunity. We have a
computer teacher there who offers

157
00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:07.780
a computer class, a programming
class and it's pretty full

158
00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:10.510
year round it's he uses
gaming to try and get

159
00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:14.340
people hooked on into it.
But it's still there. We

160
00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:16.750
get a bunch of good
programmers. Well, not a bunch,

161
00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:19.090
but we probably get two
or three each year that

162
00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:22.240
are good programmers. But do
you think that Two or

163
00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:25.000
three programmers per year per
high school is really gonna,

164
00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:29.140
you know, solve the, solve
the problem and yeah, No,

165
00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:30.910
I don't think it'll solve
the problem, but that's a

166
00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:34.510
good place to start. We
have more than three programmers,

167
00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:36.700
but a lot of them
just lose interest or just

168
00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:38.620
want to do something else
in high school instead of

169
00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:41.470
just straight computers. So when,
when you ask, you know,

170
00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:42.940
other other kids like, Hey,
what do you wanna do

171
00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:44.500
when you grow up? Or
in this case, you guys

172
00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:46.930
are 18 next year. What
are you majoring in? What

173
00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:51.160
are these guys majoring in
community Political science business. Yeah.

174
00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:54.610
Stuff like that. I dunno.
It's just, people don't want

175
00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:57.570
to spend their doing that
coding. I guess they want

176
00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:00.930
to do something more exciting.
Is there a coolness factor

177
00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:05.500
here? Someone had to code
the iPhone, Right? That it

178
00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:08.300
all depends on what you
do, how you define. Cool.

179
00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:11.000
But I, I would think
that programming, something like that,

180
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.850
it's awesome. You know? Oh,
that's why you're an intern

181
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.280
right here because you guys,
and here we are in

182
00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:20.150
the summer, right? In the,
in beautiful rainy, Portland's pouring

183
00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:23.900
rain right now. And you
other, what are your friends

184
00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:26.930
doing? Are they having internships?
No, they're sitting on the

185
00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:29.480
couch just watching TV. Okay.
Some of them have a

186
00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:33.230
job, but other than that,
Eric, a lot of my

187
00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:36.650
friends are doing internships, but
I think only one other

188
00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:40.880
one has something remotely related
to doing computers. She's over

189
00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:45.770
at Nike doing web design.
But I think like going

190
00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:51.110
with a Scott's previous statement,
like engineering is probably getting,

191
00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:53.450
I think in my opinion
is probably getting bigger, but

192
00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:56.660
it's just not in the
computer related field, like in

193
00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:00.200
the news. And just along
my peers, there's a lot

194
00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:03.200
of people going into chemical
and vial engineering. It's just,

195
00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:06.230
I don't know if there's
much interest for computers and

196
00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:08.570
itself. So do you notice
a difference at all, between

197
00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:11.690
interest in software versus interest
in hardware? I would think

198
00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:14.690
that since all of you
guys have mobile phones basically

199
00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:16.970
implanted in your heads, that
you would, and I mean,

200
00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:19.130
is technology a big part
of your interaction and your

201
00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:21.740
daily life and your SMS
and friends and stuff? Wouldn't

202
00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:26.720
that cause more interest in
technology? I think people are

203
00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:30.920
more, more interested in the
products then through the process

204
00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:35.000
of doing it, like just
with iTunes, like most people

205
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.660
don't really know what happens
behind it or like using

206
00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:44.030
the iPhone or any iPod
or anything like that. They

207
00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:46.460
just want to use it
and show it off, but

208
00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:49.220
they don't really care what's
going on behind it. One

209
00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:51.500
of the things that I
like about engineering is the

210
00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:54.200
act, the idea that you're
actually going to build something

211
00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.300
and you get to point
at it and say, I

212
00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:59.210
made that, you know, this
idea, you know, the Legos

213
00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:02.240
and the erector sets and
Lincoln logs. I mean, it's

214
00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:06.860
the building. And when I
meet people who don't know

215
00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:09.650
how their toaster works and
are not interested in whoever

216
00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:12.020
the designer was that came
up with that, I'm just

217
00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:15.290
shocked. How can you not
care about that? Certain people

218
00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:18.950
just care about understanding how
things work, other others don't

219
00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:21.410
they just want to use
it there. They just want

220
00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:24.860
it done quickly. Don't care
about anything else. Is that

221
00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:27.440
genetic? I mean, this, as
soon as I saw a

222
00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:30.920
CD player, I wanted to
take it apart. Yeah, no,

223
00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:34.070
I think that's a big
part of programming is an

224
00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:36.680
engineering. You just want to
understand how things work and

225
00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:39.650
take them apart. Some people
want to do that. Some

226
00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:44.120
people don't. So assuming that
you guys have that kind

227
00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.970
of passion that you want
to do these things as

228
00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:49.280
programmers, what kinds of things
do you want to enable?

229
00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:51.320
What kind of scenarios do
you want to create? I

230
00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.650
mean, right now, you know,
just like last year, shady,

231
00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:56.620
you did a, you know,
a mobile banking and, and

232
00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:59.290
this year you're doing, you're
doing PowerShell and doing build

233
00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:02.110
scripts. You're learning how large
systems get built. And, and

234
00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:05.350
Eric, you're working on administrative
consoles and asp.net two Oh.

235
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:08.920
And things like that. That's
not exactly, you know, saving,

236
00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:12.100
saving babies or, you know,
what do you want to

237
00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:13.930
do? Do you do, do
you want to enable new

238
00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:16.450
interactions between customers? Do you
want to do music? I

239
00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:19.540
mean something in programming, but
I wanna understand with these

240
00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:23.430
new powers, What will you
do? I really have no

241
00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:25.470
idea what I want to
do, but I know that

242
00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:27.630
when I have a task
and then when I complete

243
00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:30.090
the task, if I've been
struggling on it for like

244
00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:31.470
a couple of days or
so, and then when I

245
00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:33.390
finish it, it gives me
a really good feeling. I

246
00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:36.150
feel like I've done something
and I really liked that,

247
00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:38.250
but I have no idea
what I really want to

248
00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:42.750
do with it. I'm guessing
kind of, I guess, in

249
00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:46.110
kind of the same, I
don't really have a clear

250
00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:48.420
idea of what I want
to do, but like, if

251
00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:50.850
I'm doing it and I
finish it, then I can

252
00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:52.860
play on it and say,
Hey, I actually did that.

253
00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:57.270
That's something that I accomplished.
So it's the, it's the

254
00:12:57.630 --> 00:12:59.730
Build. And then the feeling
of accomplishment and bill and

255
00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:02.040
feeling of accomplishment, but you
don't have like a burning

256
00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:05.820
desire to build the next
Google or like, I want

257
00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:07.470
to learn to be a
programmer so that I can

258
00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:11.010
solve some problem that is
like personal to you. Like

259
00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:13.800
for example, I'm diabetic. So
I wanted to, you know,

260
00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:16.200
write programs to help diabetics.
That was something that was

261
00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:17.760
interesting to me. You know,
I didn't think I'd get

262
00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:21.270
into banking. Is there anything
like that you thought about

263
00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:30.120
you written programs for yourself?
I don't recall. That was

264
00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:33.750
a very, very politically correct
answer. JW, if you built

265
00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:37.950
any utilities, you, I built
a couple small things, but

266
00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:42.540
mainly I just write, I
turn regular games into text

267
00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:45.180
based games and I think
that's pretty fun. Like I,

268
00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:48.090
I built a game. I
built clue out of Ruby

269
00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:50.550
and had a whole bunch
of wins scenarios. You wrote

270
00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:54.030
the board game clue. Yeah.
Yeah. You, you don't move

271
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:57.390
around or actually you do,
you have a certain amount

272
00:13:57.390 --> 00:13:59.550
of spaces that you can
go and then you can,

273
00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:02.370
ER, Is it graphical or
is this a text game?

274
00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:05.760
Yeah, I thought it was
pretty fun. And you have

275
00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:07.560
a certain amount of points
you can use each turn.

276
00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:11.130
You can either go to
a different room or say

277
00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:12.890
who did it or that
sort of thing. Yeah. Let's

278
00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:15.900
see. That's so that's so
interesting because you built a

279
00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:18.630
text game and I would
think that people would want

280
00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:23.190
to build crazy 3d three
X-Box three 60 thing. Yeah.

281
00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:26.310
That's more of a graphical
thing using like programs like

282
00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:29.820
Maya. And that's just, I
mean, I guess I wouldn't

283
00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:32.730
surprise, like that's how I
learned to program, right? I

284
00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:35.820
mean, I think the listeners,
those of listeners that are

285
00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:39.390
over 30 that was being
absorbed in those kinds of

286
00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:41.370
games, you know, that was
like the bomb. Is there

287
00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:43.830
a retro thing going on
here that, that you guys

288
00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:45.900
dig that kind of stuff?
Well, the thing is that

289
00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:49.080
I, I got kind of
a bad feeling, I guess,

290
00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:51.860
for three D games or
not 3d, but games. Cause

291
00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:54.800
I used a program called
game maker and it was

292
00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:56.570
good for a while, but
when you actually wanted to

293
00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:59.810
use it, that gooey was
really unfriendly. And so that

294
00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:02.590
kind of threw me off.
So you've had a you've

295
00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:05.800
rebelled and then made, made
Zurich again. Right. Well, I

296
00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:08.110
can do that. I have
the abilities to do that.

297
00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:11.590
Just using Ruby or just
a texting, a scripting language

298
00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:13.900
really easily. So yeah. Did
you look at stuff like

299
00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:16.030
the, like there's the action
a framework you can write

300
00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:19.690
games for the Xbox Out
of C-sharp really? No, I

301
00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:22.270
just got a book in
the mail yesterday. That's X

302
00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:26.110
and a game development And
it's basically a, You pay

303
00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:28.690
like 50 bucks, you get
visual studio express and then

304
00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:30.760
you can download it. You
have an X box. No,

305
00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:33.550
I don't. Okay. Well let's
figure something out, you know?

306
00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:35.560
Oh, well we're going to
have just the control interview

307
00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:38.710
is over. Oh yeah. I'll
bring, I'll bring the book

308
00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:40.390
and maybe we've got an
Xbox here. Maybe we'll try

309
00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:42.920
to put something together and
talk to it. Yeah. I,

310
00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:44.920
I, the only thing I
know about that as some

311
00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:47.800
guys don't, don't appreciate you
messing with the hex box,

312
00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:50.930
but That is true. The
Xbox here at Kirlian is

313
00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:52.720
sacrosanct. We shouldn't tell them
that we're going to mess

314
00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:55.780
with it. Yes. So what
are some things about current

315
00:15:55.780 --> 00:16:00.490
technology and current languages that
you don't like? There's, there's

316
00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:02.980
a couple of things I
don't really like first off,

317
00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:05.770
I guess I don't really
like seeing so much spam

318
00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:10.150
in my email. So like
I get, I get around

319
00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:13.000
like 50 to a hundred
messages and when general box

320
00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.910
every day and just annoys
me, it could be in

321
00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:17.650
the spam box though. Yeah.
They get in the spam

322
00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:20.020
box, but just seeing it
there. Oh, seeing you there

323
00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:23.710
bugs you. Yeah. Okay. Cause
sometimes like my friends would

324
00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:25.000
send me links and they
ended up in the spam

325
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.730
box, so I have to
go fishing for them Constant

326
00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:29.650
back and forth pulling stuff
in and out of spam.

327
00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:32.350
Do you think about the
algorithms that the, whoever figured

328
00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:35.020
that out too? What's spam
or what's not. I think

329
00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:37.150
about it, but like it's
kind of hard to guess

330
00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:39.250
what it actually is. Yeah.
Yeah. It must be, it

331
00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:40.960
must be harder than we
think, because stuff keeps showing

332
00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:43.360
up in there. It's funny
how the false positives are

333
00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:46.960
really with buggy. Yeah. What
about you had originally been

334
00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:50.560
a PHP programmer, which is
a kind of a loosely

335
00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:53.590
type scripting language. How much
of a transition was it

336
00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:56.440
for you to start doing
Sharp? I think PHP is

337
00:16:56.440 --> 00:17:00.070
generally easier than C-sharp just
because it's so loose. Like

338
00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:02.800
I made the transition into
C sharp and it was

339
00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:07.030
sort of a pain because,
well, the syntax is similar,

340
00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:08.310
but as soon as I
put it in, I got

341
00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:11.830
all these errors because of
all the, all the variable

342
00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:15.220
types that I had to
convert over. Yeah. So moving

343
00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:18.520
things from strings to incentives
belongs. Yeah. What about you?

344
00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:21.310
What about you? I'm more
of a fan of the

345
00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:26.050
loose based programming languages. Cause
I'm doing PowerShell right now

346
00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:28.990
and that's pretty loose and
it automatically converts things. It's

347
00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:31.900
really, That's interesting because you
were, I mean last year

348
00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:34.210
you were C sharp guy
and then this year you've

349
00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:36.430
been PowerShell guy. Right. I
started out as a visual

350
00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:40.030
basic guy and interesting just
cause that's what we was

351
00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:42.040
taught and that's pretty loose.
And then I went into

352
00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:44.530
Java and didn't like it
because of the reason that

353
00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:46.900
I had to convert things
from strings to ins and

354
00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:49.860
all the time and longs
and that just got annoying

355
00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:51.960
and remembering the semi-colon, you
know, at the end of

356
00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:53.780
the year I bring the
semicolon. That's why you hate

357
00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:56.240
it. I hate C sharp
that damn semi-colon I'll know

358
00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:00.620
it. And I don't know,
Is it feel fluid? I

359
00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:03.290
mean, is it a, No,
it doesn't feel as fluid

360
00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:06.170
to me. I, I, I,
I just like the looser

361
00:18:06.170 --> 00:18:09.830
ones, because then it's more
of a language oriented than

362
00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:12.680
a math oriented and you
have to are technical cause

363
00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:15.020
with language, you know, things
are more loose and you

364
00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:17.030
say one thing and it
will interpret it that way

365
00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:20.840
versus with C-sharp and Java,
you have to throw it

366
00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:23.180
in exactly the same way
every time. If I can

367
00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:25.970
paraphrase. Are you saying that
you like the way that

368
00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:29.390
John, you know, you write
it in PowerShell or in

369
00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:31.490
a more dynamic and more
loosely type language and it

370
00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:34.970
just, it, it knows your
intent. Well, in C-sharp you're

371
00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:36.890
having to be really specific
about stuff that you don't

372
00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:39.050
feel you should have to
be specific about. Like it

373
00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:40.820
should be, it should be
guessing, like that's a force.

374
00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:42.800
That's what I meant. I
put this and in a

375
00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:45.050
string it should become a
string. That's what I meant.

376
00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:47.810
You kind of tossed to
me to extremes, but that's

377
00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:51.770
kind of what I'm getting
at. Okay. If that was

378
00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:54.320
not a good paraphrasing, I
don't know. It was just

379
00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:57.290
interesting. I mean, this is
a, a sample size of

380
00:18:57.290 --> 00:19:00.500
two, right? Where, you know,
two out of two interns

381
00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:04.040
believe that a loosely typed
more dynamic languages are better.

382
00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:06.410
You know? And I don't
know if that, if that

383
00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:09.980
is something that we're finding
just generally cause C Sharp's

384
00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:12.560
making a move to being
more of a, kind of

385
00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:15.080
a hybrid language, but it's,
you know, it's, it's, it's

386
00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:17.030
a little slower. We're in
C sharp three, O's got

387
00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:20.210
some things like variable types
that are just VAR where

388
00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:21.590
you can stick a string
in there and you can

389
00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:23.660
stick it in it in
there. And it's it's okay.

390
00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:27.260
But you know, that's things
that are emerging. Now. I'm

391
00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:30.740
wondering if the young people
are, you know, if the

392
00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:32.660
day of static typing is
over and the young people

393
00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:35.600
want to move back towards
that more, more, more fluid,

394
00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:38.750
more fluids, my word, more
fluid languages. I think fluid

395
00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:41.930
is pretty good. So you're
digging PowerShell though. Yeah. PowerShell

396
00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:44.600
is awesome. But the, the
main problem I have a

397
00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:48.020
certain language is just the
installation. Cause if it doesn't,

398
00:19:48.050 --> 00:19:51.140
if I can't get it
running well, then it's, I'm

399
00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:52.820
not going to use it.
Cause that was my main

400
00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:55.820
problem with Java was we
had one textbook and then

401
00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:58.250
we didn't have the right
compiler for that. And then

402
00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:00.590
nobody had the skill set
to help me with that.

403
00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:02.960
And then I was looking
on the internet and I'm

404
00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:05.000
assuming most people already knew
what they were doing. And

405
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.400
I was just a new
open. They, I didn't know

406
00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:10.520
where to get help from.
So the kind of initial,

407
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.070
initial hump of like, what
exactly do I need to

408
00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:17.450
start programming and make it
work? Right? Yeah. Like I

409
00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:18.830
remember that we had a
lot of trouble getting your

410
00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:20.810
box to build because we
had to install all these

411
00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:24.170
prerequisites and stuff. Exactly. Yeah.
Of course. With PowerShell, with

412
00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:27.890
Ruby, it's pretty much self
contained. Yeah. Yeah. Ruby, even

413
00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:30.170
more so than power show.
Cause PowerShell, I was setting

414
00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:32.660
up power tab from my
one eye, which is awesome

415
00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:35.360
though. Yeah. It was pretty
hot. That's the tab completion

416
00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:38.180
stuff for PowerShell. It's awesome.
Yeah. Mao who wrote that

417
00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:41.690
is an awesome guy. So
last question here when I

418
00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:48.370
retire and when we retire,
right? The old guys, what

419
00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:51.510
are you guys going to
to change? Well, I, I

420
00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:54.820
want things to be more
compatible with each other. For

421
00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:57.610
instance, I don't like the
iPod at all, just because

422
00:20:57.610 --> 00:21:02.140
it's so incompatible with other
machines. I mean, it just

423
00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:06.100
sucks. I like things more
like that. Creatives, MP three

424
00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:08.620
players. Cause they're just a
lot easier to deal with.

425
00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:10.750
You can toss in whatever
you want. You don't have

426
00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:13.180
to use iTunes to convert
them. You can toss in

427
00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:16.570
MP3s waves, whatever you're in
the mood for or WMA,

428
00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:19.930
but what the iPod, it's
all about the <inaudible> format.

429
00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:23.080
And it's tough getting things
into that stuff, getting things

430
00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:25.360
out of that. And it's
just not compatible with other

431
00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:29.110
programs and things like that.
So I'm hearing openness is

432
00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:31.330
something that's important. I mean
that the right things should

433
00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:34.450
work together. Things should, inter-operate
no one should be locked

434
00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:37.090
into something. And if you
don't like a tool, if

435
00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:38.650
you like, if you like
the iPod, but you don't

436
00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:41.680
like iTunes, it should be
alternatives. Right. And there are

437
00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:46.030
some, but ultimately 99% of
people use iTunes. Right. And

438
00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:50.020
I like alternatives instead of
just having one main thing

439
00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:52.960
that controls everything. Okay. That's
a good question. What about

440
00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:54.610
you, Eric? What are you
going to change? When, when

441
00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:57.490
I'm dead? I guess I
wouldn't change as much in

442
00:21:57.490 --> 00:22:02.140
the software aspect, but like,
I don't really particularly like

443
00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:05.380
the way computers are right
now because at home I

444
00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:08.410
still, even though I have
one of those flat screen

445
00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:10.930
monitors, it's still pretty hard
to keep your eyes on

446
00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:14.770
it for pretty much hours
at a time when I'm

447
00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:18.700
working on a project. And
like my wrists tend to

448
00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:23.200
tighten up, like if I'm
a keyboard too much. So

449
00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:26.830
maybe a different type of
design for the computer screen.

450
00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:29.830
And do you like tablets?
Do you like touch screens?

451
00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:34.660
Do you think that's where
the answer is possibly? Like,

452
00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:38.050
it depends on how someone
would design it. Like what

453
00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:39.640
can you be more specific?
Like I know that there's

454
00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:42.010
talk about gestures. Like I
was, I've always wanted to

455
00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:43.630
be able to just wave
my hand in front of

456
00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:47.320
my screen and minimize my
windows. Yeah. That would be

457
00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:50.380
pretty cool, but you'd have
to be pretty accurate to

458
00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:53.410
like move one or the
other we have. But if

459
00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:57.640
somebody, if somebody said that
and then didn't try, because

460
00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:58.990
I said, well, gosh, I
don't know if that's going

461
00:22:58.990 --> 00:23:01.810
to work. Then it never
would actually happen. Right. Yeah.

462
00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:03.670
I mean, I never would
have believed the iPhone or

463
00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:06.400
like, you know, the Microsoft
surface where it's like the

464
00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:08.920
entire coffee table is a
monitor and I can move

465
00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:11.680
stuff around with my fingers,
but you know, somebody ultimately

466
00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:14.770
has to do that. And
at this point when I'm

467
00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:18.340
old and gray, it's gotta
be you guys. Do you

468
00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:22.750
think that you're up for
it if I'm not on

469
00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:27.220
a couch watching TV? Sure.
Yeah. Okay. So this has

470
00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:30.040
been another episode of Hansel
minutes with the interns here

471
00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:33.520
at Trillium shady and Eric.
Thanks guys for taking time

472
00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.530
out of your busy day.
And I get back to

473
00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:39.040
work, stop screwing around and
you won't be paid for

474
00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:41.650
this half an hour. We'll
