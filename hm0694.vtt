Scott Hanselman, Hansel minutes. And
today I'm talking with ULI

10
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.550
Sakkara, she's working on her
PhD in nanotechnology and all

11
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.730
things small as well as
things like synthetic biology. Thanks

12
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.540
so much for chatting with
me today. Hey Scott, how

13
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.690
are you? I'm lovely. And
I'm talking to you from

14
00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.950
Portland and it's midnight and
you're in Australia. I'm actually

15
00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.700
in Auckland, New Zealand In New Zealand.
Okay. Because usually you've moved,

16
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.460
you're originally an Australian or
you're in New Zealand right now.

17
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.850
Yep. All right. Well, thanks
for taking the time and

18
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.400
dealing with all the time
zone changes. Oh my pleasure.

19
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.700
I'm not particularly good at
dealing with times. I don't

20
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.960
think anyone is. I've noticed
online as you talk about

21
00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.820
science and nanotechnology that some
people have challenged you that

22
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.110
nanotechnology isn't a thing. And
you know, I'm not a

23
00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.480
scientist, but I do know
how to use the Google

24
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.200
and Google indicates that nanotechnology
is in fact a thing.

25
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.310
Why is this a controversy?
Is, is, is there confusion

26
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.830
about whether or not nanotechnology
is a useful and applied

27
00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:00.050
science? I'd say that if
there's controversy, it's pretty mild.

28
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.320
And you know, if, if
nanotechnology, isn't a real thing,

29
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.620
when there's a range of
universities and institutes that probably

30
00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.350
need to have a name
change. If that's the case.

31
00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.060
I think some of the
opposition to the term Lennar

32
00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.130
technology has arisen from a
few things. Firstly, a sense

33
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.710
of perhaps that it's hype,
but that it's actually not

34
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:30.380
a separate subject. It's just
an, an applied subject. There's,

35
00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.460
there's also some skepticism about
it because it was used

36
00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.320
as a term, as, as
one scientist, put it to

37
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.800
get grant funding, to obtain
a lot of grant funding.

38
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.000
And this idea of nanotech
being the next frontier and

39
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.730
that it has gone very
little fruit, but at the

40
00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.790
same time, I would say
that it's definitely a real

41
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.390
thing. Not simply because I'm
biased, but it's a real

42
00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.060
thing because it refers to
the kind of branch of

43
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.970
material, science of chemistry and
a range of other disciplines.

44
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.800
So it's, it's a multidisciplinary
area that uses a whole

45
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.070
bunch of techniques to create
new devices and new materials

46
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:22.030
that work in both organic
circumstances and inorganic circumstances. So

47
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.510
both in living things and
in nonliving things to create

48
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.240
all kinds of new devices.
I see. So it's, it's,

49
00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.330
it's a wide enough term
that it can refer to

50
00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.040
the sizes of something like,
like I know what a

51
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.550
meter is, and I understand
that a nanometer is a

52
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.250
billionth of a meter and
there must be lots of

53
00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.560
things that are that small.
Exactly. So there's a lot

54
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.630
of things that, that are
that small. So it's sort

55
00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.030
of like the joke is,
well, what about Pico technology?

56
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.890
I think that's called chemistry.
So it's really that the

57
00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:58.590
way that materials behave at
a certain scale at the

58
00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.830
nano scale is different and
unique to the way that

59
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.670
it behaves at other scales.
So anything so smaller than

60
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.180
about one centimeter or bigger
than about a hundred nanometers

61
00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.390
or say a few hundred
nanometers, the material will behave

62
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.940
differently. And the best example
that I can give you

63
00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:21.420
of that is that gold
at the macroscopic level is

64
00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.850
this shiny yellow, orange, or
yellow color. You know, you

65
00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.520
can pull it into wires,
you can beat it into

66
00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.820
very, very thin gold leaf.
You can do all sorts

67
00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.800
of things about with it.
It has a very low,

68
00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:39.120
relatively low melting temperature for
a metal, but when you

69
00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.130
have nanoparticles, they look completely
different. And they're often in

70
00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.340
suspension. And rather than looking
like the goal that we've

71
00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:53.190
seen jewelry, they're actually red
solutions of, of, of red

72
00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.610
particles or green particles. And
it just looks like a

73
00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.450
green liquid or a Brown
liquid or red liquid. And

74
00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.500
that's because the size and
the shape of gold microparticles

75
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.350
interferes with light in a
way that it doesn't interfere

76
00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.890
at the macroscopic level is
a gold dome, is it

77
00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.170
is still gold. And that's,
what's amazing. You know, like

78
00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:20.430
we, we use an acid
of gold and we just

79
00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.430
use chemistry to generate these
gold particles. And so what's

80
00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:28.020
what happens is that because
they're so small, they can

81
00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.210
interfere with the wavelengths of
light and the way that

82
00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.430
they react with light is
so different. And so that's

83
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.440
why they have different colors.
And it also depends on

84
00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:39.780
their shape. So gold nanoparticles
that are about 20 to

85
00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.710
30 nanometers in diameter tend
to have a solution to

86
00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:48.360
them or a colloidal suspension
of them is the technical

87
00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.210
term. It tends to be
a really nice sort of

88
00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:56.100
bright, almost blood red, a
really bright red. And so

89
00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.850
it's more like a noir.
And when you go out

90
00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:03.320
to about 40 nanometers, it's
like a Clara it's or

91
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.720
if you go even higher
to about 50 nanometers, it's

92
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.660
like a mellow it's really
dark and a little bit

93
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:12.050
purplish as well. But if
you have nother stars, they're

94
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:16.130
often the solution is green,
but if you have pyramids,

95
00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:20.210
the solution can be Brown.
So the way that they

96
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.360
interact with the lights as
a material is completely different

97
00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.180
to the way that they
interact with lights as a

98
00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:30.730
bulk substance. Wow. That would
really make one question kind

99
00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:34.810
of reality itself. I mean,
we already questioned how light

100
00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.080
is a thing because it's
part of a visible electromagnetic

101
00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.960
spectrum. So we can always
ask you, like, is your

102
00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.630
red the same as my
red, but now you're telling

103
00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:45.400
me that something that I
want to count on, which

104
00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.950
is that gold is gold.
I can't even count on

105
00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:52.420
that. Yeah. It depends on
the size. The gold powder

106
00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.820
that I use to make
the solution is just yellow.

107
00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:58.090
It's not like a nice
shimmery gold, but some of

108
00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:01.390
my colleagues have found that
if we centrifuge down our

109
00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:03.880
particles and we do it
too hard, they tend to

110
00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:08.020
clump together and it's, and
they found that it actually

111
00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:10.330
starts to take on more
of a gold color once

112
00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:14.200
a lot of them come
together at once. So you

113
00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.600
can get back to that
point. It's just that weird

114
00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.930
things happen at these smaller
scales. And so we want

115
00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:22.420
to make use of that.
So for example, you can

116
00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:27.040
actually make nanoparticles that will
convert energy from infrared to

117
00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:31.150
a much higher level. Like
I'd say going from about

118
00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:35.650
six to 700, even 500
nanometers as, as infrared, I

119
00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:39.370
think, and then it will
convert it down to say

120
00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:42.640
blue light. And that light
is, has a lot more

121
00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:45.550
energy and it can do
things like break chemical buttons.

122
00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:48.730
So if you shine a
laser on it, on those

123
00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:52.090
particles and they usually made
us semiconductors and they're dope

124
00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:57.190
with different kinds of metals,
you can actually use infrared

125
00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:02.530
laser, which is a much
slower energy. It doesn't burn

126
00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:05.260
you and it can penetrate
through the skin to a

127
00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:10.360
certain depth. And if you've
got, say a particle implanted,

128
00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:14.650
you can actually convert that
energy to a higher form

129
00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:17.770
of energy like blue light,
or you can convert it

130
00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:21.130
to heat. So you can
vet it down from infrared

131
00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:27.310
to just heat. And it
can be used to generate

132
00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:29.350
heat, to destroy tissues that
you want to get rid

133
00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:33.670
of, or it can be
used to emit light so

134
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:36.580
that you can say use
it as a marker for

135
00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:42.370
a MRI. Ah, interesting. So
you're saying that if the,

136
00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:45.430
the changes, the way that
things behave when they are

137
00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:48.040
a smaller can allow us
to change things when they

138
00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:50.290
are bigger, as we filter
them through these smaller things,

139
00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:52.510
you could affect glass, you
could affect lenses, you can

140
00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:55.350
affect lasers. You could use
this to, you know, not

141
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:56.790
to not to jump to
the next thing, but you

142
00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:59.790
can cure cancer with this
because you are you're, you're,

143
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:02.730
you're getting down to the
tiniest particles and changing the

144
00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:05.160
way, the things that we
use at the largest size

145
00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:09.920
behave fundamentally. So, yeah, so
to some extent, so what

146
00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:13.280
we're saying is that we
can use these amazing properties

147
00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:17.570
to do things like treat
cancer or to use them

148
00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:20.360
as better detectors or like
say, we want to find

149
00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:24.320
a cancer in someone. What
is it, the secondary cancers.

150
00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:29.960
We can Mark those particles
with a targeting molecule and

151
00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:34.520
saying, check them. And that
we can then use MRI

152
00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:36.380
to see if we can
pick up those particles and

153
00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:40.370
where they might be, because
those particles will then interact.

154
00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.780
They, you know, the limit
either a bit, well lied.

155
00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:50.480
So, or they'll show some
density, then you can use

156
00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:54.470
them to, to detect things.
Everything is so small. I

157
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:56.480
mean, I don't think you're,
you're not talking about like

158
00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:00.770
having one or two nanoparticles.
You made the term Nanosphere.

159
00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:03.380
Are we talking about solutions
of millions or billions of

160
00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:07.070
these particles? That's right. Millions.
Well, usually thousands of them,

161
00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:11.630
we can create several thousand,
hundreds of thousands of them

162
00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:15.920
in a small, to relatively
small cheated, like 50 mills.

163
00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:19.970
You know, they can be
used for generating all kinds

164
00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:23.780
of nano particles that are
useful to us Is everything.

165
00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:26.870
When it gets this small
a sphere or can something

166
00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:30.140
be nanoparticle sized and be
a, like you said, a

167
00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:33.410
pyramid or, or a square
or cube, It can be

168
00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:35.630
whatever size you want it
to be. So that's one

169
00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:38.030
of the great things about
nanotech is that when you're

170
00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:41.660
making that a particles, you
can, you know, the way

171
00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:43.700
that we make things at
the macro level is say,

172
00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:45.890
we might have a mold
and then we pour some

173
00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:49.940
plastic into it or some
metal. And we might, you

174
00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:53.930
know, shave off the, the
uneven bits, even in three

175
00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:56.360
D printing. When you're printing,
you have all these other

176
00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.100
little bits that you need
to kind of cut off

177
00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:03.560
and smooth, smooth the final
product, but with nanoparticles and

178
00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:05.390
too many other kinds of
nanoparticles, which you're aiming to

179
00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:07.400
do is to create these
things without having to do

180
00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:11.030
too much physical cutting. So
you can do these things

181
00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:12.890
with lasers that say, you
might use a laser to

182
00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:17.150
cut out different shapes with
lithography, but with nanoparticles in

183
00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:19.850
the chemist, in the, in
a chemistry wetlab, you can

184
00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:22.250
just create them in a
solution so that you get

185
00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:25.070
quite a lot of particles
that are the same size

186
00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:29.720
and have the same properties
and have turned out the

187
00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.910
way that you want them
to be. So you can

188
00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:37.010
actually, we make a pyramid
middle or by pair middle.

189
00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:40.340
So like two pyramids stuck
together with a flat side,

190
00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:43.880
stuck to get up. And
that solution is, is Brown

191
00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:46.550
colored, but we make them
from gold by starting off

192
00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:48.470
with a little bit of
silver and gold, and then

193
00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:51.290
we add stuff to it.
So it grows. And then

194
00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:53.560
we use acid to kind
of itch off little bits

195
00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:59.560
of silver. So the way
that the crystals form crystals

196
00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:01.990
forms in choose the shape
of the final shape of

197
00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:05.200
the particle. And so we
use those properties when we're

198
00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.680
generating those particles. And that's,
so it's very clever sort

199
00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:13.080
of materials, chemistry, but at
the nanoscale. So to put

200
00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:15.150
this into context from maybe
people who might be still

201
00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:18.150
a little bit confused about
how small this is a

202
00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:22.470
nanometer one, nanometer is a,
is an exist as an

203
00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:26.940
example from nano.gov. It's how
long your fingernail grows in

204
00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:31.650
one second, a sheet of
paper is a hundred thousand

205
00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:34.980
nanometers thick. So it makes
me think about a paper

206
00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:38.460
cut. It was certainly at
least a hundred thousand nanometers

207
00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:41.970
thick, or maybe a little
bit more Well, or you

208
00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:43.860
could think of it. Like,
I think one of our

209
00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:47.130
favorite measures is the width
of a human hair. So

210
00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:50.820
it's what maybe a thousand
or less the size of

211
00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:57.090
a human hair, maybe even
10,000 to one 10,000. It's

212
00:12:57.090 --> 00:12:59.970
hard to say that word,
isn't it? Well, because we're

213
00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:02.280
talking about so many numbers
that are so small, like,

214
00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:04.470
like if you go and
ask Google how big an

215
00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:06.150
animator is, they will, they'll
just give up. And they'll

216
00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:09.450
say, you know, one times
E to the negative ninth,

217
00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:12.450
they're like, it's 1 billion, but
they just give up, how

218
00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:15.120
do you know that they're
there though? Are you looking

219
00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:19.740
at a microscope? We can
use electromicroscopy to visualize them.

220
00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:22.650
And that's actually one of
the nicest things I find

221
00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:27.180
is that when you've made
a nanoparticle and you can

222
00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:29.250
look at it under an
electron microscope, and then you

223
00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:32.100
see all these beautiful particles
that are very, a lot

224
00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:35.220
of them, like say about
70 to 90% of them

225
00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:41.460
are similarly sized within a
really good range. And they

226
00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:44.910
have like a by pyramids,
have a beautiful shape with

227
00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:48.600
smooth facets and stuff. And
you can have styles that

228
00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:51.660
are very spindly and spiky,
or you can have stars

229
00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:55.920
that are shaped, like stars
that we draw this fee.

230
00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:58.710
The surgical ones are not
always so beautifully spherical, but

231
00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:02.160
they're mostly, you know, spherical
so that you can also

232
00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:06.480
make tiny capsule shaped gold
particles as well. So it's

233
00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:08.820
just amazing that you can
sort of look at, you

234
00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:11.520
can create these things in
solution. You can examine the

235
00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:14.760
mantra, electron microscope, because an
ordinary light microscope just isn't

236
00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:17.910
strong enough. It doesn't have
the magnification for it, but

237
00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:20.730
you can also use things
like spectroscopy. You can use

238
00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:23.670
electrophoresis and a whole bunch
of other ways to detect

239
00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:27.810
them. Hey, did you know
about the strange loop conference?

240
00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:31.770

249
00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:19.520
was the first time that
you kind of fell in

250
00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:21.470
love this? How did you
fall in love with small

251
00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:25.010
things like this? And was
there a long time before

252
00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:26.870
you actually saw one, or
did you see one and

253
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:29.920
say, Oh, this is what
I want to do? Well,

254
00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:34.480
I was actually working in,
in cancer research in cancer.

255
00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:38.170
Immunotherapy is actually, so we
were working on a molecule

256
00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:41.740
called CD 73, which we
found was involved in breast

257
00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:45.490
cancer development. And also we
think might be implicated in

258
00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:53.860
prostate cancer development. And we
basically generated therapy and certainly

259
00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:56.440
our work was in, in
animal models, but it's now

260
00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:59.920
there is a human version
of, of what we created

261
00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:03.070
and it's been it's in
clinical trials. I thought, you

262
00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:05.020
know, it'd be really interesting
to see if we could

263
00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:09.280
deliver these therapies better in
a more direct way directly

264
00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:11.020
to cancer cells. And so
I was aware that this

265
00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:14.140
is something that you could
do with nanotech. And I

266
00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:18.610
was interested in creating better
delivery mechanisms for cancer therapies,

267
00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:21.100
because, you know, for cancer
therapies, a lot of the

268
00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:25.240
ones that we're familiar with,
like chemotherapies actually quite toxic

269
00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:27.640
to the person who's receiving
them and make you very,

270
00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:31.510
very sick because it's, and
it's a side effect because

271
00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:40.120
things like doxorubicin, for instance,
chemotherapies, target fast growing cells.

272
00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:45.130
So cancer cells are cells
that our body produces that

273
00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:48.730
have evolved in, in a
way where they divide very

274
00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:52.060
rapidly as well. And so
that's why, you know, they

275
00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:55.210
consume so much. That's why
people get very sick. So

276
00:16:55.330 --> 00:17:00.400
when you give people a
chemotherapy, it, it targets, obviously

277
00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:03.040
it kills off cancer cells,
but it also kind of

278
00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:06.070
circulates through your body. And
then it kind of affects

279
00:17:06.070 --> 00:17:07.990
other fast growing cells, which
is why people have their

280
00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:11.080
hair fall out, or they
become very, very sick. And,

281
00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:14.440
you know, to kind of
avoid that, what we want

282
00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:18.790
to make sure is that
where possible we get chemotherapies

283
00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:21.760
and other therapies as much
as possible direct them only

284
00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:25.630
to the cancer cells or
primarily the cancer cells so

285
00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:29.140
that the effects on the
patient are far less severe

286
00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:34.420
and it makes recovery a
lot, lot easier. So I

287
00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:37.120
think that nanotech was one
way of doing it. And

288
00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:39.760
so the opportunity to carry
out this research in trying

289
00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:44.080
to develop a nanoparticles that
could deliver therapies. And in

290
00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:49.710
my case, specifically, gene therapies
to disease causing organ per

291
00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:53.010
cell, sorry, disease cells came
up so that I ended

292
00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:56.700
up pursuing that. So I
really just wanted to make

293
00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:00.170
sure that we could be
better at delivering trucks. <inaudible>

294
00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:05.750
that's really exciting. My wife
had cancer and the, of

295
00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:10.670
course she's okay. The, but
the treatment was a, well,

296
00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:14.630
it was effectively napalm, isn't
it? Right? Yeah. Yeah. It's

297
00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:17.600
just, let's just blow all
of this stuff up. And

298
00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:20.930
we'll hope that in the
ensuing melee, the cancer was,

299
00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:26.280
was, was involved in some
way. Exactly. Yeah. And, and,

300
00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:28.130
and the thing is though,
there's always, you know, in

301
00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:29.870
the movies, when there's an
explosion and the bad guy

302
00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:31.760
gets to, there's always a
bad guy who jumps away

303
00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:33.440
from the explosion and runs
away. And that's what happens

304
00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:35.240
with cancer. Like that's a
one, all you need is

305
00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:38.300
one cell that didn't make
it Exactly because, because, you

306
00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:42.440
know, there are a mess
of cells that have rapidly

307
00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:45.230
evolved or they're rapidly growing.
And the muted organizing a

308
00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:47.270
lot. There's a lot of
things that have to go

309
00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:48.950
wrong for a cancer cell
to form, and then a

310
00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:51.290
lot of things for it
to keep growing and to

311
00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:57.830
be maintained, but because there's
constant, you know, genomic mutagenesis

312
00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:59.990
happening within the cells, a
lot of change happening within

313
00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:04.580
the cell, within the cancer
cell genome, that it means

314
00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:07.310
that it can become resistant.
So there might be some

315
00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:13.490
cancer cells that might survive
the process of chemotherapy. I'm

316
00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:15.110
sorry, I don't mean it
to be depressing here, but

317
00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:18.710
sometimes in some cases that's
what happens. And so they

318
00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:23.360
become resistant to chemotherapy, which
means you have to use

319
00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:25.100
something else to treat, or
you have to use different

320
00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:27.800
chemotherapies to treat them. And
that's why cancer is so

321
00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:31.130
difficult to treat because of
this ability of cancer cells

322
00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:33.650
to evolve, to kind of
evade. It can, if they

323
00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:38.870
can evade the immune system,
they can become resistant to

324
00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:42.560
certain kinds of therapies and
so on. So it's trying

325
00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:46.280
to attack it with whatever
we have in our arsenal

326
00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:50.840
from chemotherapies, but making it
more specific using other therapies

327
00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:53.270
like immunotherapies and someone, and
what it looks like will

328
00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:58.010
be the most effective is
to use combination therapies, which

329
00:19:58.010 --> 00:20:00.110
is not just chemo, but
a whole bunch of things

330
00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:04.700
to treat a cancer. The,
the, the scale and size

331
00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:08.360
is so extraordinary when you
first, I'm trying to explain

332
00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:10.130
this to my children, the
idea of an order of

333
00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:12.980
magnitude, right? Like something in
10 X, bigger, or 10

334
00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:18.230
X smaller. So DNA itself
has a diameter of about

335
00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:21.980
two and a half nanometers,
but like a bacteria is

336
00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:25.880
three orders of magnitude larger.
So if you were going

337
00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:29.390
to create something, you know,
some kind of nano vaccine,

338
00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:31.940
or put some kind of
a, of a, of a,

339
00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:35.240
of a nanoparticle together and
then put something pharmaceutical into

340
00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:37.880
it, these particles are going
to be, if I understand

341
00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:41.360
correctly smaller than the cells,
they're like little minions that

342
00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:44.570
jump on top of the
cells and then deliver their

343
00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:49.330
package. Okay. Exactly. Yeah. So
it looks like that from

344
00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:52.000
a lot of the research
done so far. And because

345
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.280
I work on gold nanoparticles,
I talk about gold metal

346
00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:58.510
particles a lot. It's, it's
become evident that, you know,

347
00:20:58.510 --> 00:21:02.140
a nanoparticle has to be
a certain size. It's gotta

348
00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:05.410
be, you know, have a
different, a certain kind of

349
00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:09.160
surface chemistry that will make
the cell, notice it and

350
00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:12.100
pick it up and take
it inside the cell, which

351
00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:14.230
is what you want it
to do. Right. Because you're

352
00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:16.180
trying to deliver something to
the cell. So you want

353
00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:17.890
the cell, you want it
to go to the right

354
00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:21.220
cell festival way possible, and
then you want the cell

355
00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:23.140
to go, Hey, I'm going
to take you because you've

356
00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:25.810
got this receptor or you've
got some kind of signal

357
00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:28.810
on your surface. It says
that I should absorb you

358
00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:31.240
so I should take you
in. And so it takes

359
00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:34.210
it in using its kind
of entry system, its own

360
00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:40.350
particular entry system, Are these
things small enough to evade

361
00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:44.250
the immune system, Not necessarily.
So that's part of the

362
00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:48.000
technical challenge of creating these
things. So, you know, you

363
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.030
can get something inside the
cell, but you don't want

364
00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:54.240
the cell to think of
it as a molecule. It's

365
00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:56.220
gotta be big enough to
fit all the molecules that

366
00:21:56.220 --> 00:22:00.060
you want on there and
so on. And then it,

367
00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:02.430
the immune system might still
recognize it. So it's at

368
00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:03.900
the, kind of at the
molecular level that you do

369
00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:07.710
use, you're creating things that
are similar to macro molecules

370
00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:10.560
produced by the cell, but
they happen to be made

371
00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:12.990
of metals or it happened
to be made of polymers

372
00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:15.870
or all sorts of other
things. And you know, you,

373
00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:19.980
as a scientist have spent
time generating the structure and

374
00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:22.620
you can only hope that
the immune system doesn't detect

375
00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:24.720
it or we can, you
know, we can sometimes coat

376
00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:26.760
the particle with things so
that we can stop the

377
00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:30.720
immune system from reacting to
it. So we can only

378
00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:32.370
do our best and that's
part of the whole testing

379
00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:34.920
process, but that's certainly something
that we have to consider

380
00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:38.910
when we're making our particles.
When you put something in

381
00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:40.260
someone and you, I mean,
of course you do a

382
00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:44.550
lots of nanomaterial safety toxicity
testing in vitro, but when

383
00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:46.980
this is introduced into the
body and it does its

384
00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:49.560
job, is the particles still
around and that it needs

385
00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:52.830
to be injected or the
body rejects it and flushes

386
00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:57.060
it. So what we've found
so far is that some

387
00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:01.890
studies find that nanoparticles pretty
much just evacuated by the

388
00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:06.870
kidneys. In other instances, they
might actually end up collecting.

389
00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:11.430
I, I'm not sure there
might be collecting in the

390
00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:14.520
liver, but because the quantity
is so tiny, it's not

391
00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:19.140
toxic, but basically so far,
they seem to be not

392
00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:22.950
too, they're not too toxic.
And that's one reason why

393
00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:26.040
we use gold because they
it's, non-reactive, it doesn't react

394
00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:29.310
to that much with other
molecules. If it's in the

395
00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:31.890
bloodstream, it will just pick
up protein, you know, Sierra

396
00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:34.230
proteins, and they'll just stick
to the gold. And, you

397
00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:38.040
know, the gold keeps going
happily around the bloodstream, but

398
00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:41.580
they can be cleared by,
by the, through renal or

399
00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:45.320
rather renal clearance or the
kidneys rather. So when we

400
00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:46.880
make our powder goes, we
do have to take that

401
00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:49.580
into consideration too, because most
of our early testing is

402
00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:51.800
just an in vitro. And
then when we go through

403
00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:54.470
the animal models, that tells
us a little bit more

404
00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:57.050
about that. So to get
to the point of testing

405
00:23:57.050 --> 00:24:00.050
on humans means you've already
done a whole bunch, but

406
00:24:00.050 --> 00:24:03.050
it still doesn't guarantee that
it will work in humans.

407
00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:06.760
Is there any concern like,
you know, in the movies,

408
00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:10.420
nanotechnology always ends up multiplying
because it doesn't multiply. We

409
00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:12.850
won't actually see it, right.
It'd be too small, right?

410
00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:16.270
Can, could you build something
that could make more of

411
00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:20.290
itself? So this is, I
think the idea of great

412
00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:27.370
guru and you know, this,
we can make tiny nanorobots,

413
00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:29.560
but the way that people
might think of a tiny

414
00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:32.110
robot is they might look
at a transformer or a

415
00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:35.770
simpler version of a transformer,
a small robot, like a

416
00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:39.160
toy robot, and then it's
shrunk to the net level.

417
00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:42.520
But it's at the Neto
size. Really what tends to

418
00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:47.860
happen is more along the
code of molecular motors. So

419
00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:52.090
back, I think it was
in 2016, the Nobel prize

420
00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:56.710
was awarded to chemists who
created the first molecular motors.

421
00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:01.630
And these molecular motors functioned
like motors, but there were

422
00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:06.550
made of large sort of
branching, carbon molecules, branching, you

423
00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:08.710
know, rings and things like
that. But they functioned like

424
00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:13.240
motors. So you have to
think of nanobots is probably

425
00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:16.570
looking functioning a bit like
that. They're not made of

426
00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:19.510
arms and legs, tiny arms
and legs that have climbed

427
00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:22.390
together, but they, they function
like a molecule in some

428
00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:25.870
way. It's just that they
happen to be a large

429
00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:29.650
kind of molecule with other
bits on it. And these

430
00:25:29.650 --> 00:25:33.430
aren't like deeply sophisticated, you
know, robots as they are

431
00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:36.970
kind of automaton. Yeah, that's
right. That's sort of be

432
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.620
more like automatons. And at
the same time, you know,

433
00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:44.680
you're expecting that these automatons
will function so perfectly that

434
00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:47.530
they will be able to
take any energy and consume

435
00:25:47.530 --> 00:25:52.480
anything from the environment to
keep replicating themselves. And in

436
00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:54.520
a way you're basically saying
that you're trying to create

437
00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:59.650
a manner, take version of
a, what's the word that

438
00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:03.130
I'm looking for a perpetual
motion machine. And we know

439
00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:06.100
that a perpetual motion machine
is only, you know, it's

440
00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:12.850
not actually possible because you
will always lose energy in

441
00:26:12.850 --> 00:26:15.550
some way or another. And
the conversion of energy is

442
00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:19.720
never perfect. And so that
applies to nanobots as well.

443
00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:22.540
So I think it is
highly unlikely. You know, I

444
00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:24.820
could, I can only say
as a scientist is highly

445
00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:28.390
unlikely rather than impossible, but
it's highly unlikely that we

446
00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:30.070
will be able to create
that and end up with

447
00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:33.700
a planet covered in gray
goo. Yeah. I worry about

448
00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:36.460
that, but now I won't
worry anymore because it sounds

449
00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:38.920
like it certainly the scale
wouldn't work, but where would

450
00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:40.570
they be getting all their
energy from and they'd event

451
00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:43.680
That's actually, so, I mean,
yeah, they'd have to like

452
00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:47.910
small living things, but even
living things require certain things

453
00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:52.110
to be that requires certain
conditions depending on what kind

454
00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:55.620
of organ organism they are
and someone to reproduce themselves.

455
00:26:56.010 --> 00:26:58.920
So if you want to
create an artificial life form

456
00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:05.160
effectively, but using organic substances
like metals, you're going to

457
00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:06.750
have as much as a
problem as a living thing.

458
00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:11.540
So it sounds like what
I've learned today is that

459
00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:15.620
nanotechnology is really kind of,
it's very multidisciplinary because there's

460
00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:19.550
material science, people doing tiny
things, there's biologists doing tiny

461
00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:23.120
things, but people doing medicine
and it might be, it

462
00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:25.460
might be difficult to separate
that from the, from the

463
00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:28.430
other sciences, because it's such
a fun word to say,

464
00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:31.370
but you could be a
nanotechnologists in a number of

465
00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:34.880
fields You could use. What
I would say is rather

466
00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:36.620
than saying you can be
an added technologist in a

467
00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:38.390
number of fields. I would
say that you use a

468
00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:42.320
number of fields to be
a nanotechnologists. Hmm. I like

469
00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:46.970
that. So what I do
is slightly different to what

470
00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:49.610
my colleagues in my PhD
lab. So I'm actually in

471
00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:51.620
a different lab at the
moment where I work on

472
00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:56.240
endometriosis now, but my PhD
research, most of my lab

473
00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:58.730
works on electronic skin and
a lot of them are

474
00:27:58.730 --> 00:28:01.730
chemists and some of them
are chemical engineers, but they

475
00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:03.860
work on an electronic skin.
And so they're trying to

476
00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:10.850
replicate our living tissue using
inorganic materials. Whereas I try

477
00:28:10.850 --> 00:28:14.870
to use inorganic materials to
deliver something to living tissue,

478
00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:19.520
but we're all in that
are technologists. Okay. That's very

479
00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:21.770
clear. That makes a lot
more sense. Yeah. So basically

480
00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:28.910
what nano technologists largely do
is create new materials and

481
00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:34.340
new devices using the properties
of materials at the nano

482
00:28:34.970 --> 00:28:41.960
scale. And we also try
to replicate biological functions using,

483
00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:45.830
you know, getting materials. So
we're trying to replicate them

484
00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:49.580
out officially. Fantastic. One of
the other things that I

485
00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:52.550
want to make sure that
people follow in closing is

486
00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:56.210
a project that you have
called real scientists, and everyone

487
00:28:56.210 --> 00:28:59.480
should go to Twitter slash
real scientists. It's got almost

488
00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:02.180
75,000 followers, and this is
a really clever idea. You're

489
00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:05.060
introducing us to real science
from real scientists. Is this

490
00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:09.140
a who runs this account?
It's someone different? Yeah. So

491
00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:12.050
what happens is so real
scientists was an idea of

492
00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:16.310
my friends, Bernard Kaylee, who
works in the it and

493
00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:21.380
another friend of ours, James Smith.
And we saw James treating

494
00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:24.950
about science on a rotation
curation account. And we thought,

495
00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:27.260
well, Bernard thought, William, why
don't you just have a

496
00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:30.110
different scientist every week? You
know, we like different national

497
00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:33.230
accounts of different say at
Sweden has a different Swedish

498
00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:36.320
person. So we thought we'd
start with that. And we

499
00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:38.780
thought it'd be a good
way of getting people to

500
00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:43.060
talk to scientists without, with
fewer barriers. We want people

501
00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:45.850
to be able to ask
scientists questions. We want them

502
00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:49.720
to engage with them. And
we want people to also

503
00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:51.850
see what kind of careers
that you can have as

504
00:29:51.850 --> 00:29:55.900
a scientist. And what kind
of, you know, you can

505
00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:57.520
do a science degree and
not stay in science, or

506
00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:00.460
you can start it as
a beautician or someone in

507
00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:03.310
advertising and end up in
scientific research, which is what

508
00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:05.740
some of our curators have
done. So we wanted to

509
00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:10.930
display the variety of careers
and to also get people,

510
00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:14.620
to stop being afraid of
asking questions and to ask

511
00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:17.530
the questions I've always wanted
to ask scientists. So we

512
00:30:17.530 --> 00:30:20.800
have a different person on
every week, a few months

513
00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:24.790
ago, we had the NASA,
a group from NASA GIS

514
00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:28.420
and they were in Iceland
looking for extremophiles. So we

515
00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:32.590
got to see that life
as they're in Iceland, another

516
00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:36.760
time we've had people who
were working on Lincoln CD

517
00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.480
disappeared into satin. We had
people talking, we had planetary

518
00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:43.480
scientists talking about what was
happening. So that was pretty

519
00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:46.750
cool. And this week we've
got someone who works in

520
00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:51.250
science policy and he's actually
involved in science policy with

521
00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:55.560
the us house of reps
Rock on. Well, one of

522
00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:57.300
the things that I'm really
enjoying about it is I'm

523
00:30:57.300 --> 00:31:01.050
noticing that some of the
scientists that, that, that tweeted

524
00:31:01.050 --> 00:31:03.060
real scientists, if you go
into look at their actual

525
00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:06.210
personal accounts, they may only
have a few hundred followers

526
00:31:06.210 --> 00:31:09.120
and they may be hanging
out on, on science, Twitter.

527
00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:12.210
So I wouldn't ordinarily bump
into them, but because your

528
00:31:12.450 --> 00:31:15.780
real scientists account has such
a wide reach, it's introducing

529
00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:18.120
me to people and then
I can go and follow

530
00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:20.850
them after they're done with
their week on real scientists.

531
00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:24.510
Exactly. You could keep following
their adventures if you'd like.

532
00:31:24.810 --> 00:31:28.890
So the people who are
behind this account, Helena led

533
00:31:28.890 --> 00:31:35.910
Mia, Yens follow Sarah Faber,
Fatima, and a whole bunch

534
00:31:35.910 --> 00:31:38.850
of people involved in this.
There's a lot of us

535
00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:42.300
working behind the scenes to
bring this to you every

536
00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:44.640
week. So I just wanted
to kind of acknowledge them

537
00:31:44.730 --> 00:31:48.990
and apologies for getting some,
No worries. We'll shout a

538
00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:50.820
shout out to them. And
I would encourage everyone. Who's

539
00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:53.880
listening to check out Twitter
slash real scientist. And thank

540
00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:55.950
you so much. You'll put
it if you're Sakkara for

541
00:31:55.950 --> 00:31:59.550
your time today. Thank you
for having me, Scott. This

542
00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:02.220
has been another episode of
Hanselminutes and we'll see you

543
00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:23.370
again next week. <inaudible>.
