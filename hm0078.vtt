episode, Scott talks about the

10
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:15.260
2007 ultimate tools list. Hi,
this is Carl Franklin. Welcome to

11
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.460
Hansel minutes, and I'm here
with Scott Hanselman. And of

12
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.720
course we're talking today about
Scott's 2000 ultimate developer and

13
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.140
power users tool list for
windows. How's it going, Scott?

14
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.350
That's going pretty well. We
did the tools list again

15
00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.280
this year, I guess I
just said we me, me

16
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.580
late at night, the Royal
we, and I've been doing

17
00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.900
this list since 2003. And
when we, when I update

18
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.590
it, I do all of
the, the updated entries and

19
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.290
the new entries in red.
So this is up at

20
00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.930
hanselman.com/tools, and it's getting actually
it got so big that

21
00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.740
it broke feed burner last
year. Wow. Because it's something

22
00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.340
like 500 K when it
turns into HTML. So the,

23
00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.530
it blew up. It didn't
really blow up, but it

24
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.550
basically overflowed how much they
think that a normal RSS

25
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.770
feed should be. So I
had to open a ticket

26
00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.530
with them. Hey, before we
get into the tools, let's

27
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.970
revisit 'em last week show,
right? Last week show is

28
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.370
when we talked about moving
life into the cloud, right.

29
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.070
Moving into the cloud, and
we're going to explore live

30
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.690
custom domains. Right? You had
set up a male, all

31
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.440
your friends and family on
Google apps. And I said,

32
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.930
I would, I was going
to try windows live. So

33
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.290
right. I did. I tried
it. I was really, really

34
00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.060
impressed by the simplicity of
the interface and in the

35
00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.070
uncluttered nature of, you know,
of setting things up, it

36
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.950
was very easy to do.
The administrative interface was very

37
00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.940
clean. Yes, it was. Yeah.
There was a couple of

38
00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.300
things, a couple of features
missing that were deal breakers

39
00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.860
for me, but apparently they're
coming, but I just couldn't

40
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.780
wait. And the one was
there. Isn't a good way

41
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:11.070
to, to move existing emails
up there. Yeah. That's a

42
00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.050
problem with Google as well.
I mean, you can, if

43
00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.560
you pay the premium for
the 10 gigs and you

44
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.500
have an IMAP account, moving
is no problem at all,

45
00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.640
but I had to actually
purchase another $30 utility of

46
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.810
a cool little company called
limit nun that basically pushes

47
00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.850
all my mail up and
then brings it all back

48
00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.810
down again. It was kind
of a complicated experience. There's

49
00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.740
no reason that you shouldn't
be able to upload a

50
00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.230
PST and have them open
it up and stick it

51
00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.540
into the mail. Yeah, That
was my thought too. Or,

52
00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.350
or at least a CSV
file or something simple, but,

53
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:46.110
okay. So that was one
and the other one, which

54
00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.320
was really more important to
me cause you know, third

55
00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.150
party tools or third party
tools. And if I can

56
00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.970
get my email up there
somehow that's great. But the

57
00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.170
deal breaker was I couldn't
forward an email to, I

58
00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.480
couldn't forward emails from one
account to an account that

59
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.380
wasn't a Hotmail account or
an MSN account. So you're

60
00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.360
saying if you're a male
is up at live customer

61
00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.110
domains, you couldn't turn around
and have it forwarded back

62
00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.010
outside. That's right. Probably do
avoid spam, but definitely something

63
00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.740
that they need to do
that seems like, I think

64
00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:20.310
you're right. I think it's
a spam prevention measure because

65
00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:25.110
forwarding, having, having a email
addresses that can forward to

66
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.500
other email addresses is the
main cause of spam. I

67
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.140
mean, that's the main tool
that spammers use. Well, you

68
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.730
gave it a try. Yeah.
I give it a try.

69
00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.160
And if I had more
time, I could wait for

70
00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.990
that feature to come out,
but I just don't have

71
00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.180
more time, so. Sure. Well,
it looks more there's stuff

72
00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.500
in it in a couple
months and see how it

73
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.450
goes. Yup. Alright. So onto
the list. So the list

74
00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.580
is, like I said, it's
getting bigger and bigger this

75
00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.470
year. Everything is in red
that has been added lots

76
00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.050
and lots of things like
literally literally dozens and dozens

77
00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.080
of links of an updated.
It's amazing when you maintain

78
00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.900
a list, that's this big,
the amount of link rot,

79
00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.670
this thing, if you print
it out, something like 20

80
00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:07.080
pages now and the number
of links that rotted and

81
00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.520
people did not even bother
to redirect was really disturbing.

82
00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.850
And I received at least
six emails within the first

83
00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.430
few hours from people saying,
well, you're linking to me

84
00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.470
and it looks like there's
a page there, but that's

85
00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.590
really the old page. Would
you link here? It would

86
00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.950
have been nice if everyone
was using 301 redirects and

87
00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.080
I could have run it
a utility, which I did

88
00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.220
to check all of the
links and then report, which

89
00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.610
one has been updated. So
I could have watched for

90
00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.350
three Oh one and three
Oh two redirects and had

91
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:40.770
the list automatically update itself.
But instead I get email

92
00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.930
from people saying you're pointing
to the wrong place, please

93
00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.240
point here, which is fine.
But I just thought that

94
00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.490
was an interesting little aspect
of the, of the web.

95
00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.620
This is a one I
list I update every year,

96
00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.760
usually in July or August
and the links rot. And

97
00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.710
I have no way to
automatically update them. It's going

98
00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:58.640
to think that people, many
people who put Up websites

99
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.820
still don't think of them
as sites that are going

100
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.680
to be, they think of
only as sites, they're going

101
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.620
to be read by eyes
and not by, you know,

102
00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:10.090
lengths or yeah, yeah. Yeah.
Well, there's also a sense

103
00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:12.940
of, of impermanence, but you
know, I'm looking at my

104
00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.970
archives here and I started
in April of 2002, five

105
00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:18.070
years in the scope of
things is very, very short,

106
00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:21.010
but at least all the
links still work and the

107
00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:23.860
links to my old radio
web work anyway. All right.

108
00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.140
So in the first category
here, we've got big 10

109
00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:30.430
life and work changing utilities.
And these are just kind

110
00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:33.160
of my top 10 favorite.
I always come to these

111
00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:36.460
utilities and these did not
change that much this year

112
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.180
when something is pretty awesome.
It's not likely to change,

113
00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:43.480
but I did have two
additions. The first was E

114
00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:47.080
text editor. I just can't
seem to decide between notepad

115
00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:51.190
to notepad plus plus and
E but he is the

116
00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:53.650
addition to the list at
the top there. And it

117
00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:57.490
is just a really amazing
basically they call it text

118
00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:00.190
made for windows. Text mates
are really famous application on

119
00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:02.530
them, on the Mac that
a lot of the rails

120
00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:06.310
guys have used. And it
basically plays in Cygwin. You

121
00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:10.090
know, Cygwin is that Linux
like environment for windows and

122
00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.090
lets you build what are
called bundles. So then rather

123
00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:15.880
than just having syntax highlighting
where you've got colors for

124
00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:19.960
a particular file type, you've
got bundles of information that

125
00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:27.220
are macros little programs, a
little insert, insert expansions that

126
00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:29.170
are specific to that file
type. So there's like the

127
00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:32.860
HTML bundle, but then there's
the HTML blogging bundle and

128
00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:37.240
the XHTML bundle. And these
all include custom commands just

129
00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:40.780
specific to that particular thing.
And the bundles use Cygwin.

130
00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:43.180
So you can write these
bundles yourself by shelling out

131
00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:48.010
into Python or shelling out
into a bash shell and

132
00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:51.010
modify your, your world. So
if someone wanted to make

133
00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:53.980
a PowerShell bundle and make
a eText editor that much

134
00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:57.400
more friendly, they could, One
thing that's missing from the

135
00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:03.400
ed tech Senator webpage is
a real screenshot. Yeah. The

136
00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:08.200
text editor I'm a webpage
has a bunch of screencasts,

137
00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:10.960
but I do like to
see a screenshot. As soon

138
00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:12.960
as I hit a page,
I want to see a

139
00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:15.040
screenshot or a big button
that says click here for

140
00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:18.340
the gallery. It's funny how
many, how many places you'll

141
00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:20.920
visit and you'll hunt for
a screenshot. And I really

142
00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.830
should see that first screenshot
right off the bat. Part

143
00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:27.640
of the impatience of the
internet, PowerShell is still on

144
00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.530
the list, but a couple
of really cool things have

145
00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:33.040
happened in PowerShell this year.
One that is really of

146
00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:39.250
note I thought was called
power tab by the powershellGuy@thepowershellguy.com.

147
00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:42.580
And you've seen like ANSI
art. Remember when we had

148
00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:46.510
at the, at the command
line, we would draw boxes

149
00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:49.900
and you'd have winter environments
like turbo vision, Orland, turbo

150
00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:52.240
vision. And they would build
these wintering environments just using

151
00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:56.220
anti-art. He has basically made
tab completion at the command

152
00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:00.720
line as a script using
antsy art like construct so

153
00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.450
that you can start typing
in PowerShell hit tab then

154
00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:05.760
rather than getting the classic
tab completion that we're used

155
00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:10.110
to seeing in the, in
dos at CMD dot exe,

156
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:14.250
we'll see an actual answer
pop up and he'll automatically

157
00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:18.090
reflect over all of the.net
framework assemblies that are in

158
00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:20.640
the current app domain build
up a little database, all

159
00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:25.200
of the WMI classes and
makes a really fast and

160
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.950
easy way to, to start
using PowerShell. It's really very

161
00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:34.770
amazing. Another thing is the
PowerShell community extensions. This is

162
00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:37.020
a really great thing about
code Plex is that right

163
00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:39.210
now it seems like when
a Microsoft product comes out,

164
00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:41.940
if it has an extensibility
point and someone doesn't like

165
00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:46.020
some aspect of it, minutes
later, the whatever community extensions

166
00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:49.020
version goes up with, you
know, the couple of dozen

167
00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:51.210
commands that didn't make it
into V one. So then

168
00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:54.000
people will build these extensions
for them. And this one

169
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.800
includes all sorts of, of
cool commandlets and functions that

170
00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:02.010
are things like out speech.
So you could be at

171
00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:05.700
command line and PowerShell pipe,
something out to out hyphen

172
00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:07.740
speech and it would talk
it to you. Things like

173
00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.900
that, just all sorts of
cool things you didn't know

174
00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:13.320
you needed. And then the
other big thing on the,

175
00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:16.400
the big 10 list this
year was this was Firebug

176
00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:23.240
Firebug is, is really an
in-browser IDE for JavaScript, Ajax,

177
00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:29.090
CSS, HTML, debugging. It is
truly amazing if you haven't

178
00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:31.670
used this thing, you really
need to check it out.

179
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.030
It's a complete debugger that
lives in is installed in

180
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:39.050
Firefox as an extension. And
it has its own extension

181
00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:43.610
techniques as well. So you
can extend fire Firefox with

182
00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:46.400
Firebug, but then Firefox can
have Firebug rather she's me

183
00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:49.220
can have its own extensions
as well. Now I'm curious

184
00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:50.870
as to why you didn't
put this in a developer

185
00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:53.780
category. I did actually. That's
funny that you mentioned that

186
00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:56.270
when something is so incredibly
awesome on the list, I

187
00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:58.940
put it two and three
times. So if you find

188
00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:01.490
something more than one place,
that means that it's so

189
00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:06.770
intensely awesome. You must get
it immediately. Yeah, totally. Yeah.

190
00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:10.250
So it's down there to
Firebug includes things like profiling

191
00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:12.140
of your JavaScript, like a,
you know, just if your

192
00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:16.700
performance and finding JavaScript bottlenecks,
it also lets you execute

193
00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:19.730
JavaScript on the fly. Kind
of like the immediate window

194
00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:23.570
in visual studio as well
as a full JavaScript thing.

195
00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:27.680
So as much as I
despise JavaScript of just because

196
00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:31.610
I'm not good at it,
I don't like playing with

197
00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:34.430
it. Cause it's just seems
so loosey goosey having an

198
00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:37.820
IDE like this alongside of
visual studio, 2008, it's just

199
00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:41.000
really clean. So if the
visual studio 2008 scripty bugger

200
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.380
doesn't need it, doesn't do
what I want to do.

201
00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:46.610
I'll flip over to Firebug
and I can see all

202
00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:50.150
sorts of information. And then
there's a thing called why

203
00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:55.270
slow? You heard about why
slow this is Yahoo's performance

204
00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:58.420
labs. No, I haven't. This
is pretty slick. Y there's

205
00:11:58.420 --> 00:11:59.710
a whole thing going on
in the net right now

206
00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:03.340
about why slow, where people
are running. This tool runs

207
00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:07.480
inside a Firebug against their
websites and it basically applies

208
00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:11.560
kind of 13 commandments that
Yahoo has come up with

209
00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:16.210
for performance websites, things like
we've we have found in

210
00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:19.840
our experience at Yahoo that
this number, some number is

211
00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:22.090
the maximum number of JavaScript
you should have on a

212
00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:27.340
page anymore. Can really cause
you performance problems. Or do

213
00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:33.010
you have HTTP compression turned
on 13 different kinds of

214
00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:35.800
commandments. You run it and
it gives you an a

215
00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:38.470
through an F it's for
each of these 13. And

216
00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:40.870
then it gives your site
on a, through an F

217
00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:43.900
overall, I got like a
D all sorts of things

218
00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:46.360
were wrong now. Not all
of the things that Yahoo

219
00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:49.900
says are, are gold because
some of the suggestions like

220
00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:53.230
the second one it makes
is use a content distribution

221
00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:55.540
network. I don't think every
blog is going to use

222
00:12:55.540 --> 00:13:01.190
Akamai to host their images,
geo synchronously located, know, you

223
00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:05.980
know, whatever geo load balance
rather. But for the most

224
00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:08.260
part, it shows not only
what you can do with

225
00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:11.290
Firebug as an extension, but
it also gives us an

226
00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:15.870
insight into what makes Yahoo
stuff so fast. Okay. So

227
00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:18.870
I see that why slow
is in the developer category

228
00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:21.270
under Firebug there's a whole
bunch of other things here,

229
00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:26.040
new things in the developer's
life. Yeah. You know, there's

230
00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:28.140
so there's so much stuff
going on the developer's world.

231
00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:32.490
I don't want to make
this list just a, a

232
00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:34.860
brain dump in the sense
of here's a bunch of

233
00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:37.380
stuff. I really try to
put up things that I

234
00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:41.250
not only use, but I
use, you know, every week

235
00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:45.000
at the minimum things that
I really are tools that

236
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.520
are a part of my
life. I mean, anyone could

237
00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:49.740
just put up a big,
giant list of tools. That's

238
00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:51.780
just a bunch of stuff
out there. Right. But I

239
00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:53.610
really wanted to express the,
these are the things I

240
00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:57.600
use regularly. And in this
situation on the list where

241
00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.060
I have an item and
then two other items that

242
00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:03.840
are like indented, like for
example, I've got wind merge,

243
00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:06.570
which is the diff tool
I've been using for years,

244
00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:09.150
but I've also got kind
of an inner conflict going

245
00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:12.630
on because source gear released
dif merge. It's a free

246
00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:15.000
merge tool and they released
it because they thought that

247
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.180
they could make the world's
greatest emerge tool. And then

248
00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:21.150
K diff three. These are,
these are three different diff

249
00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:24.540
tools that I honestly and
truly go between. I hop

250
00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:27.630
back and forth between these.
And I'm kind of having

251
00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:30.180
a little inner turmoil, trying
to decide which one of

252
00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:33.300
these I want to stick
with. I would use now

253
00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:36.180
people always bring up beyond
compare from scooter software and

254
00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:38.880
it totally is awesome, but
I haven't paid for it.

255
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.550
So these are the free
versions that I, I should

256
00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:43.980
probably put beyond compare up
there. Cause if you want

257
00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:47.190
to buy a diff tool,
it is the bomb. So

258
00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:51.680
yeah, I should probably update
that don't Oh, Telerik the

259
00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:56.240
Telerik code converter. And then
Carlos AGS code translator. These

260
00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:58.940
are two sites that are
really great for converting C-sharp

261
00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:00.590
to VB. So if you
have to write a sample

262
00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:03.050
for an article and the
editor says, well, I want

263
00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:05.930
the sample in both C-sharp
and VB. This is, these

264
00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:10.640
are really great online tools
to do that. The Teleric

265
00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:13.580
one it's a little smarter
than Carlos's, but Carlos has

266
00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:16.490
does Ajax, so I can
just type and it'll automatically

267
00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:17.960
do it. So I kind
of bounce back and forth

268
00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:22.130
between those two. Those are
very cool. Then under like

269
00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:26.870
XML stuff, doing developer stuff
in XML sketch path. It's

270
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:31.100
pretty cool. Sketch path.com. Do
you remember Don XMLs X

271
00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:34.180
path mania? Yeah. We talked
about it on DNR TV

272
00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:37.790
showed it. Yeah. It's kinda
like that, but it, it,

273
00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:42.310
it does even more. It
lets you support. Basically. It

274
00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:45.460
has libraries of expressions like
David for David for common

275
00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:50.320
stuff like data tables or
open XML. And it's pretty,

276
00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:53.230
pretty kind of on steroids.
Ex-pat mania is nice and

277
00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:56.140
integrates into visual studio while
sketch path has kind of

278
00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:58.990
a world of its own
reminds me of Roy Rove's

279
00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:03.820
regulator number the regulator for
regular expressions. It's like that,

280
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.660
but it's four, four X
path it's in beta and

281
00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:10.900
it, but it's crazy. It's,
it's, it's pretty hardcore and

282
00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:13.450
X path can be pretty
intense. And one of the

283
00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:17.950
I've been talking to Don
XML about, about XML for

284
00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:20.620
link or link for XML,
I guess it's called. So

285
00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:22.630
I'm working on an XML
chapter of a book right

286
00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:24.370
now and I'm doing the
XML for link stuff right

287
00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:27.550
now. And that seems to
be a, almost a direct

288
00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:33.310
replacement for ex-pat It? I
wouldn't say well, by saying

289
00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:35.920
it's a replacement that implies
that it was intended to

290
00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:39.700
replace, but it definitely could
Within the bounds of normalcy.

291
00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:41.680
I mean, when I say
that, I mean that it

292
00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:44.920
does the same thing you
can do. You can do

293
00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:48.940
queries with link for XML.
Yeah. Yeah. It was just

294
00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:50.560
like you could with X
query. Of course we know

295
00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:53.710
that that got dropped. Yep.
There's our next week show.

296
00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:56.740
Let's do that. Let's do
XML X query a XML

297
00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:58.990
for link or link for
eczema. That sounds good. All

298
00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:02.800
right, we'll do it. Oh
yeah. Speaking of regular expressions,

299
00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:10.540
David, <inaudible> got a Ajax
space rejects tester. So this

300
00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:12.460
is, you know, I like
these, I think these little

301
00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:16.960
Ajax applications, like a little
rejects tester that lets me

302
00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:19.810
type in a regular expression
then as I'm typing, it's

303
00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:21.910
going in and updating all
the different things like the

304
00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:24.910
matches in replacements, the match
groups, it's kind of an

305
00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:29.410
online version of Chris cells,
rejects designer and then a,

306
00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:34.540
a less.net focus, but really
excellent. One is called Rex

307
00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:39.310
V and that's at Rex
v.org. And it's, it's more

308
00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:44.230
focused on PHP, but it
is really, really thoughtfully laid

309
00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:48.070
out rejects expression editor online.
And I use both of

310
00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:51.600
both Davids are Yankees and,
and then red V or

311
00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:55.290
I think it's actually called
Rex V the, of course

312
00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:57.660
the launchers, I don't know
which launcher you use, but

313
00:17:57.690 --> 00:18:00.840
the, the launchers fight in
my brain keeps getting worse

314
00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:04.650
and worse. I still use
slick run. I just can't

315
00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:06.330
seem to get my it
slick run as the little

316
00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:09.870
floating text box. Right. Then
I use that for launching

317
00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:14.190
almost all of my, all
my applications, but I put

318
00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:16.290
three new ones up this
year that are kind of

319
00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:22.170
taunting me, humanized, Enzo, E
N S O is a

320
00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:26.100
really, really strange application written
in Python. But it is.

321
00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:31.420
So if an application could
be called peaceful, you basically

322
00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:35.640
has no UI. You push
down the, the caps lock

323
00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:39.810
key and this big translucent
gray square kind of pops

324
00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:41.490
up in the corner of
the screen. And you start

325
00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:44.130
typing in this giant font
and you type in things

326
00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:46.560
like open calc and then
let go of the caps

327
00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:49.110
lock key. So it's up
only while you're holding caps

328
00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:51.030
lock. So you hold caps
lock you type, and then

329
00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:53.520
you let go and it
is the letting go. So

330
00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:56.940
you, you lose your left
pinky in the process. Well

331
00:18:56.940 --> 00:19:01.440
you do, but you surprisingly,
it did works. And the

332
00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:04.260
interesting thing about this application
is it's completely modus. It

333
00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:07.320
has no modal dialog of
any kind. You're only interfacing

334
00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:10.620
with this modus kind of
gray square. So you might

335
00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:12.330
be typing an email and
you might want to do

336
00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:15.210
some math, some quick calculation
to insert a number into

337
00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:17.880
your email. So you can
say, you know, Hey, Carl

338
00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:20.880
pie is 22 over seven,
you type in 22, hyphen

339
00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:23.730
seven, you select it. Then
you hit caps, lock type

340
00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:26.310
calculate, and then let go.
And then it takes that

341
00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:29.250
text that is in the
selected current application and replaces

342
00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:32.970
it with the actual value,
you know, stuff like that.

343
00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:36.300
Just kind of trying to
think for you. Another one

344
00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:44.010
I added was-command@tridash.com. And that
dash command is a really

345
00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:47.880
interesting one. It, it is
also trying to be focused

346
00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:51.590
on what the current application
is doing. So it's, it's,

347
00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:54.810
it's thoughtful about which application
is currently the one in

348
00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:59.550
front. And it will like
if you type email and

349
00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:01.470
start typing, it will pop
the email up and then

350
00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:04.050
insert what you just typed
into the email. So a

351
00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:07.080
lot of these applications are
just launchers, some of the

352
00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:08.970
newer ones and a lot
of the older ones that

353
00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:12.750
are trying to update themselves
to, to get the, the

354
00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:17.010
crown of greatest launcher are
interacting more with Explorer. Like

355
00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:20.880
you might click on a
folder, hit the launch button,

356
00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:23.220
the quick dash button type
zip, and then let go

357
00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:27.060
in that folder that you
had currently selected within get

358
00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:30.120
zipped up. The other one
that I added was you

359
00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:33.390
don't run all of these
simultaneously, do you? I do

360
00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:36.650
actually run four or five
at a time, cause I'm

361
00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:38.940
really trying to pick one
that's really going to do.

362
00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:42.180
And I, I'm actually a
funny, I'm interacting with most

363
00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:46.560
of these different folks, these
different launcher guys. They know

364
00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:50.710
that I'm about launchers. So
when I have questions, thoughts,

365
00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:54.250
things that I want to
make better, I will go

366
00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:57.790
back and forth with them
and, and say, you know,

367
00:20:57.790 --> 00:20:59.650
I really wish you would
have this particular command this

368
00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:02.350
well, you're using Vesco, right?
I am using Vista. Yeah.

369
00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:05.050
I don't use voice commands.
Well, that's funny that you

370
00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:07.900
say that. So I'm using
voice commands a lot lately,

371
00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:10.300
but I'm finding that the
little, even on this quad

372
00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:14.080
proc machine, the little half
second pause as I wait

373
00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:18.600
for the voice command to
be recognized is irritating. I

374
00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:22.060
mean, I mean, this sincerely
irritating if I say open

375
00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:25.390
notepad, and then it opens
that that was two, that

376
00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:27.730
was very irritating, right. But
if I just go and

377
00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:31.210
say, a window are bring
up, you know, slick run

378
00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:34.420
type in and hit enter,
or if I use like

379
00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:37.090
auto hot key and just
hit window in and brought

380
00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:40.510
up notepad directly, I mean,
you just can't compete with

381
00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:42.580
the voice stuff. It's got
to anticipate a little bit

382
00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:45.610
better. And then the last
one that I added is

383
00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:52.090
called direct access and direct
access is from a nagger

384
00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:57.310
soft and a G a
R soft. And it's kind

385
00:21:57.310 --> 00:22:01.120
of a silent application that
sits around in the background

386
00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:04.870
watching for abbreviations. So if
you type, like if you're

387
00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:06.730
in any application and you're
in, maybe you're in word,

388
00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:10.630
you type in AMA and
then it searches Amazon. And

389
00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:13.930
then there's lists and bundles
of abbreviations that it can

390
00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:16.960
watch for. And it's got
a very, very clean and

391
00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:19.600
fresh UI and the abbreviations
can be used not just

392
00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:23.740
for launching stuff, but also
of course, for expanding. It's

393
00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:26.620
almost like auto-correct for all
of windows. It's a lot

394
00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:29.890
like active words, active words
has been around for, for

395
00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:35.410
forever active wards.com. And it's,
it's one of these applications

396
00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:37.420
that just is always there
in the back watching you

397
00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:39.640
type. And then if it
sees you type something that

398
00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:42.400
is that it can act
on, then it will, we'll

399
00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:45.670
do we'll take action. It's
really interesting that between all

400
00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:50.650
these launchers, they're all just
so similar, but they each

401
00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:52.960
have a little thing that's
just different that makes them

402
00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:57.130
worth keeping around. So I'm
tortured. So why not write

403
00:22:57.130 --> 00:23:00.280
your own launcher? You know,
that's funny, I've actually started

404
00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:02.890
writing my own answer two
or three times and then

405
00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:05.470
realize that the amount of
work that every one of

406
00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:08.290
these launchers does, even the
most simple one does is

407
00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:11.080
really very significant. I mean,
you, you have to go

408
00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:15.430
and search through the start
menu program files decide whether

409
00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:17.500
or not you want to
inter interact with the windows

410
00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:20.800
index. You have to keep
local storage, you have to

411
00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:23.980
run as not admin. You
have to have nice, transparent

412
00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:25.690
effects. You have to have
some kind of sense of

413
00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:30.310
our art, artistic it. Once
you start writing the requirements,

414
00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:33.790
you realize that it's better
to work with these guys

415
00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:35.500
that are 80% of the
way there then for me

416
00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:38.920
to start at zero. Right?
So not quite there. So

417
00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:43.030
have you picked a favorite
yet? Oh man. I, you

418
00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:45.290
know, I still use slick
run so that, that, but,

419
00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:47.690
but I know that that
is very, very largely kind

420
00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:50.030
of an emotional thing. Cause
lik run was like the

421
00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:51.890
third or fourth that I
started using back in the

422
00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:54.920
day. But if they are
on the list, I have

423
00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:57.560
used them. I use them
and they're neat. So I

424
00:23:57.560 --> 00:23:59.180
would encourage people to just
pick the one that makes

425
00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:04.190
them happy. A lot of
people really like launchy launchy.net.

426
00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:07.310
That's the one that people
keep pushing me towards mostly

427
00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:13.910
the d.net developers. It just,
it just one sourceforge.net community

428
00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:18.800
choice award for best new
project. It's open source and

429
00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:22.970
it is written in C
sharp. So from a dotnet

430
00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:26.540
developers perspective, you can't really
beat a C sharp application,

431
00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:30.050
open source. That's getting community
choice awards. That's loved by

432
00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:34.070
life hacker and has a
plugin model. So launchy is

433
00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:35.540
a real, a real slick
when it's written by a

434
00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:38.780
guy named Josh Carlin. So,
you know, if you want

435
00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:41.030
to start somewhere, maybe start
with launching and then run

436
00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:43.430
around and try the other
ones on the list. Okay.

437
00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:45.710
A couple other while we
exist, as we wrap up

438
00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:48.170
here, a couple others that
are really worth noting dark

439
00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:52.520
room under is under the
stuff I just dig section

440
00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:55.760
of the list and dark
room is a text editor,

441
00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:59.270
but it's not a competing
text editor for notepad. It's

442
00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:01.370
not one that you're going
to necessarily pop up all

443
00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:05.180
the time. It basically takes
all of your screens, blacks

444
00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:08.480
them out and give you
a nice clean dark room,

445
00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:13.580
no UI of any kind
and just text. So I

446
00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:17.030
give it a nice Kermit
green, old style terminal. Look,

447
00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:19.930
you know, I've, I've given
all my command. I gave

448
00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:23.710
him my command prompt window
that look, I like that.

449
00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:27.610
Look, I really do. It's
very peaceful. It is very

450
00:25:27.610 --> 00:25:30.100
peaceful. So when I just
want everything to go away,

451
00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:32.800
I just, I fire up
dark room. I've actually got

452
00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:35.140
it on a, on a
hot key. And it's kind

453
00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:37.990
of the place that I
brainstorm. And I also use

454
00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:41.530
it for kind of really
dramatic note taking during presentations.

455
00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:44.650
Sometimes you've seen those presentations
I do without PowerPoint, right?

456
00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:47.560
Me, me and notepad. Now
it's me in dark room.

457
00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:54.010
So definitely worth checking out.
So no texts, bad, you

458
00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:56.770
know, I just hate TextPad,
you know, maybe we'll end

459
00:25:56.770 --> 00:25:59.350
on me just despising TextPad
with the heat of a

460
00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:02.380
thousand suns. I hate this
stupid tool. One of the

461
00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:04.360
things I hate texted about,
and I really don't hesitate.

462
00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:06.370
I hate textbooks. And one
of the things that I,

463
00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:10.060
that I hate about TextPad
is that by default control

464
00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:13.690
F is not fine. It's
actually F five. That's just

465
00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:16.120
irritating. Now I know I
can remap it, but that

466
00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:19.950
doesn't change the fact that
it was irritating. I, I

467
00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:22.900
liked notepad plus plus over
text bed. I also find

468
00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:25.180
editing all the different syntax
bundles and texts back to

469
00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:27.670
be very tedious. But I
know that there were those

470
00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:31.210
that worship TextPad I am
just not that guy. Well,

471
00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:34.810
Ooh, here's one, here's one
things, windows forgot the Vista

472
00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:38.170
Kodak package. You might like
this. So, you know, there's

473
00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:40.270
you ever find a video
that you're running around the

474
00:26:40.270 --> 00:26:42.280
net and you find a,
you know, a new episode

475
00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:44.760
of Seinfeld or whatever, something
you shouldn't be downloading a

476
00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:47.400
that's in some funky video
format that you've never heard

477
00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:48.900
of. And they want you
to go and download some

478
00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:52.110
strange Kodak to get it
to work. That can be

479
00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:56.820
dangerous because there are Kodak
viruses, but also they're hard

480
00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:59.700
to manage and they're difficult
to an install. The Vista

481
00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:03.020
codec Package. I did. I
got a JavaScript error on

482
00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:06.500
the page in, on which
page seven on the Vista

483
00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:09.770
code goes to Takota packages.
Yeah. When, when you surf

484
00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:12.200
around a crazy set websites
like this that are generated,

485
00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:15.140
you know, created by college
students or whatever. Yeah. You're

486
00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:18.080
going to get a million
JavaScript popups, unless you're actively

487
00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:20.480
debugging JavaScript. That's the first
thing I turned off. I

488
00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:22.310
did not need them popping
up to telling me that

489
00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:24.650
the what if, How do
you turn that off in

490
00:27:24.650 --> 00:27:31.910
97? Did it tools alt
T O for options advanced

491
00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:35.630
and you want to click
display a notification about every

492
00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:37.670
script error and turn it
to off it's under the

493
00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:42.650
browsing section of tools, options,
advanced settings browsing. Makes sense.

494
00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:45.710
Okay. All right. It's I
mean, imagine if the system

495
00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:49.940
would prompt you every single
time an HTML error came

496
00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:54.350
up, that would be pretty
amazing. Okay. Anyway, Vista codec

497
00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:58.490
package, it's literally just a
big old MSI installer with

498
00:27:58.790 --> 00:28:05.570
all of the very best
non spyware, the video codecs

499
00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:08.060
to get things like VOD
files, you know, the VOD

500
00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:11.300
DVD files ass to get
them to play and media

501
00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:13.820
center, to get them to
play in media and media

502
00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:20.300
player 11, it's got QuickTime
real media vid Devex impact

503
00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:25.730
to direct vibe. All of
these different things in one

504
00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:29.720
bundle made it really, really
easy to get funky video

505
00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:33.440
formats playing on Vista. And
if you don't have Vista,

506
00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:36.890
you want to do like
XP. There's a CC CP

507
00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:43.340
that combined combined community codec
pack that works on that

508
00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:46.400
works on windows 2000 and
windows XP as well. Very

509
00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:49.470
cool stuff. Okay. Yeah. There's
a bunch of stuff on

510
00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:51.860
the, on this. I'm just
scrolling through here. We could,

511
00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:53.930
we could talk for another
hour about, and we wouldn't

512
00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:56.150
even make it halfway through
the list. Well, that's, that's

513
00:28:56.150 --> 00:28:59.240
a pretty good start, I
think. And I think that

514
00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:01.070
we're just about out of
time. And if you wanna

515
00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:03.230
take a look at all
of the other things, you

516
00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:05.240
should go up to a
handsome and Netcom do you

517
00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:08.090
have a shrink stir link
for us? Well, right now

518
00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:12.440
it's just hanselman.com/tools. That link
will always take you to

519
00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:14.660
the latest version. So if
you blog about the list

520
00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:17.060
or if you pass the
list to somebody, just tell

521
00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:21.920
them hanselman.com/tools, it'll always go
to the latest version. Awesome.

522
00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:24.560
One thing I want to
add though, as a, as

523
00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:27.020
a shameless plug, and as
Lauren said at the beginning,

524
00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:28.850
it there's a lot of
work that I put into

525
00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:32.030
these lists. I'm not doing
it for anyone but myself,

526
00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:34.610
but I do put a
great deal of effort into

527
00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:37.370
the, into the list. And
I would really appreciate it

528
00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:39.710
if you really liked the
list. If you like the

529
00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:43.540
show, if you like reading
my blog, if you would

530
00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:47.140
make a tax deductible donation
to the American diabetes association,

531
00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:49.930
if you've listened to the
show or read the blog

532
00:29:49.930 --> 00:29:51.190
for any amount of time,
you know that I'm a

533
00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:55.000
type one diabetic on an
insulin pump and it kind

534
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.580
of sucks. And you can,
you can read about that

535
00:29:57.670 --> 00:30:03.190
at hanselman.com/fight diabetes. I would
really encourage people to make

536
00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:06.370
it a tax deductible donation.
All of it goes directly

537
00:30:06.370 --> 00:30:09.130
to diabetes research. Doesn't go
to me. If you go

538
00:30:09.130 --> 00:30:15.730
to hanselman.com/fight diabetes, we're trying
to raise $50,000 by October 20th.

539
00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:19.870
And so far we've raised
$24,000. So I've got about

540
00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:21.910
a month and a half,
two months. I gotta get

541
00:30:21.910 --> 00:30:25.470
another 26 grand and Good
luck buddy, that I've donated.

542
00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:27.990
Richard Campbell is donated in a
lot of the RDS have

543
00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:30.570
as well. Yeah, they really
have, and I really do

544
00:30:30.570 --> 00:30:35.280
appreciate that. Alright, Scott, thanks
as always, it's been a

545
00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:37.710
great show and I always
enjoy reading your tool list

546
00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:41.340
and you know, it always
takes a whole bunch of

547
00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:44.910
time out, away from my
regular life to investigate all

548
00:30:44.910 --> 00:30:47.580
these tools, but it's so
worth it. Thank you. Thank

549
00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:50.460
you. Okay. And we'll see
you next week. I'm Hansel

550
00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:50.820
minutes.
