Hi, this is Scott Hanselman

6
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.440
and this is another episode
of Hansel minutes. I'm sick.

7
00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.340
And there you go. I
got pneumonia, but that doesn't

8
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.280
mean that I can't podcast
from my death bed. And

9
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.120
today joining me on my
death bed is Javier Lozano

10
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.130
and John Calloway. How's it
going guys? So we had

11
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.760
a very interesting event that
I actually slept through. I'm

12
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.220
afraid. Forgive me. I was
not able to join you

13
00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.730
guys on, on Tuesday, John,
what did we, what did

14
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.510
we accomplish this week here
on Tuesday? Well, we had

15
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.330
a second MBC comp. We
had our first MVC comp

16
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.500
last July and it was
a little bit like code

17
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.780
camp style. We had, you
know, a lot of PR

18
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.620
we had a lot of
presentations given over live meeting.

19
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.620
And so for the second
one kind of concurrent with

20
00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.960
the MVC three release or
close closely following it, we

21
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.460
had, we wanted to kind
of blow it out a

22
00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.550
bit. So we kept up
with all the live meeting

23
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:54.170
events and we also had
a full track running in

24
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.410
the channel nine studios. So
we had some live broadcast

25
00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.190
video and we also had
all these. So we had

26
00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.280
a total of 27 presentations
going on. So it was

27
00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.750
a live virtual conference and
it was free. Wow, that's

28
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.140
cool. So this is the
first, the second year. How

29
00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.980
did, how did this start?
Whose idea was this? This

30
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.150
was actually Eric. Hexter his
idea. He kind of proposed

31
00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.580
it lasts last summer. And
I have you heard, do

32
00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.530
you have some more information
on how on the Genesis?

33
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:34.460
Yeah, actually Eric and I
lead the community for NBC

34
00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.520
virtual user group. We meet
every Wednesday at noon central

35
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.690
time. And after doing a
couple of times, Eric was

36
00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.070
like, Hey, we can go
a little bit bigger on

37
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:47.390
this. You know, what do
you think about doing a

38
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.450
virtual conference through live meeting?
And I told him that

39
00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:56.240
it sounded crazy. And then
a month later he pings

40
00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.950
me and says, Hey, we
really need to do this.

41
00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.120
So we started talking about
it and that's how the

42
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.530
whole concept of getting all
these pieces together, came to

43
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.080
be. Wow. Okay. So this
is second year and you

44
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.330
just went from being a
small user group. That's just

45
00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.550
Medicaid, only online. I mean,
how, how big is the

46
00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.340
virtual user group? And when
you do meet, how many

47
00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.200
people show up When we
do meet whereabouts 30 to

48
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.970
40 members, right. And we
cover different aspects of know

49
00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:31.320
of NBC, you know, maybe
jQuery pieces or view engines

50
00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.200
and so forth. And it
was more of the as

51
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.750
like, Hey, can, can, can
this things stand on its

52
00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.800
own. And actually the first
NBC conflicts in July and

53
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.600
now we're, we just hit
the second one. So it's

54
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.670
actually been less than a
year then if we've done

55
00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.970
this Actually yeah. Wow. That's
like six months and then

56
00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.390
another conference, six months later.
Yeah. Yeah. So we've been

57
00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.500
careful not to call this
the 2011 NBC conference expecting

58
00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.090
to do them kind of
regularly. Wow. Okay. Interesting. And

59
00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.090
this, this virtual users group,
you guys meet on live

60
00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.810
meeting as well. Yeah. Yeah,
exactly. We, we, we were

61
00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.840
able to get a live
meaning accounts through a <inaudible>,

62
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.700
you know, there that's one
of the supports that they

63
00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.780
have for dot user groups.
So we have one room

64
00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.760
specifically specific for, for that
meeting. And for this instance

65
00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.710
of MVC CARF, we decided
to create an event or

66
00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.930
live meeting and use more
rooms from that account. Okay.

67
00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.720
And I, and of course
being the international dotnet, here's

68
00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.070
your group association. And so
that's cool. So you're saying

69
00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.010
that you just asked and
they made it available to

70
00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.350
you, and this means that
the virtual user group effectively

71
00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:45.330
costs you nothing but your
time, correct? Yep. Okay. But

72
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.760
that's going from 30 people,
but I was hearing that

73
00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.060
you had as many as
2000 people for MVC comp,

74
00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.320
how do you scale John
from 30 people occasionally to

75
00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.920
2000 people in an instance,
right. Well, and you know,

76
00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.260
we don't actually have the
full usage numbers in, but

77
00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:02.940
it could be a lot
more than that, that we're

78
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.090
actually logged in on Tuesday.
It's, it's harder to know

79
00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.210
because it was the video
streaming goes over CDN and

80
00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.550
all that. But from page
hits, we could have had

81
00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:16.320
quite a bit more, but
so each individual live meeting

82
00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:22.290
has a maximum of 1,250
people. So we tested out

83
00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.780
beforehand that we could spin
up three or four of

84
00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.930
these. So that gives, that
gives some scale and individual

85
00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.870
rooms, but we still have
that cap for one meeting.

86
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.670
And if we wanted to
have, like, for instance, a

87
00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:35.880
keynote by Scott Guthrie, we needed
to broaden that out quite

88
00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.790
a bit. So in order
to do that, we decided

89
00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:41.880
to have one track that
was all given over silver

90
00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.820
light, smooth streaming, and filmed
in the channel nine studios.

91
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.870
And, Okay, so multiple tracks,
then three, three tracks you

92
00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.600
had running at the same
time, We actually had four

93
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:58.880
tracks. Wow. Okay. So four
tracks, 1,250 people max per

94
00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.310
of the, for the first
three tracks. And then one

95
00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:03.470
track was done over several
light and, and who helped

96
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:07.480
you with that? That was
the channel nine studios. So

97
00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:10.630
Nick Fellingham was kind of
our main contact there. We

98
00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:13.390
had great support all the
way up Dan Fernandez, Jeff

99
00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:16.870
San quest. And it was
kind of down to the

100
00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.000
wire a little bit because
they were doing a big

101
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.330
studio remodeled or in this
time. So they've expanded their

102
00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:25.660
studio out quite a bit.
It, it all came together.

103
00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:29.800
You know, we were having
pretty regular calls, making sure

104
00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.710
that we're up to that
it was actually gonna happen,

105
00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:36.700
you know, but so they
did all the, they have

106
00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:40.060
a really professional setup going
there. I mean, you see

107
00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.060
any of the things that
are filmed in channel nine

108
00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:46.780
and they're high quality. And
so they, we kind of

109
00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:48.550
came in and we said,
here's our schedule. What do

110
00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:51.490
you guys think? And then
I worked with Nick and

111
00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:53.260
he came up with a
schedule that was down to

112
00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.140
the minute, you know, cuts
on the video. I need

113
00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:58.000
your slate here at this
time that we're going to

114
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.550
show well, people wait and
they just, you know, they

115
00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:03.370
do the whole five, four,
three, two, and then they

116
00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:05.410
stopped talking and they point
at you and you talk

117
00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:08.620
all that stuff. So it's
a full on studio experience.

118
00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:12.130
How did you make the
jump though from a community

119
00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:14.320
based free event that was
kind of doing its own

120
00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:17.500
thing to getting kind of
Microsoft involved? I mean, I

121
00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.600
know John, you and I
worked for Microsoft, but did

122
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.540
you just, you know, make
a call to channel nine

123
00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.220
and how did you have
to pitch it? I mean,

124
00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:27.790
clearly this costs somebody money
and you know, how did

125
00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:30.340
that get paid for, or
was it all volunteer including

126
00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:33.580
channel nine's efforts? So I
can talk a little bit

127
00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:35.650
more about that. Scott, since
I was the money man

128
00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:39.520
for this, for this. And
one of the things that

129
00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.370
we ended up doing is
I, a while back, I

130
00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:46.750
had approached Scott goo about
and about doing this, you

131
00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:49.330
know, getting him on board
to do a keynote at

132
00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:51.250
that point, we weren't quite
sure how this keynote was

133
00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:55.540
going to solidify, but I
figured, Hey, it's good, you

134
00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:57.580
know, to kind of tap
his shoulder and get him

135
00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:00.580
interested. So we talked a
little bit about it. And

136
00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:02.860
then Scott goo brought up
the idea of, of doing

137
00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:05.740
it on campus because obviously
as we all know, he's

138
00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:07.960
a pretty busy guy and
actually everybody, you know, and

139
00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:10.750
they spend at a team
is pretty busy, busy. So

140
00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:15.250
we started talking about those
pieces. And from that perspective

141
00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:18.610
is our original budget for
NBC comp. One was very

142
00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:21.250
small because again, it was
no cost to us cause

143
00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:24.340
it was all through live
meetings. Right. I knew that

144
00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:27.550
was the one who was
upfronting that cost. Well, this

145
00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:30.640
instance, because we were going
with live streaming, we had

146
00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:34.390
to raise money for that.
And so we ended up

147
00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:40.060
creating three different tiers of
sponsorship, a platinum, a gold

148
00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:43.900
and a bronze. And we
had associated different benefits and

149
00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:48.910
parks for that. And, and
the, and the platinum one

150
00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:51.040
was the one that, Hey,
you're going to help cover

151
00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:53.620
most of the costs, if
not all the costs for

152
00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:56.520
live streaming. Cause at point
when we were talking with

153
00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:58.470
channel nine, we weren't quite
sure how much it was

154
00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:02.460
going to cost to, you
know, stream seven hours of

155
00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:07.680
HD video across the internet.
So we kind of tackled

156
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:11.670
for that and we actually
had a, a sponsor, they

157
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:15.000
own Bronco project step up
and be the platinum sponsor.

158
00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:19.190
You're kidding. So an open
source project stepped up to

159
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:22.790
help a community group. That's
amazing. Correct. Yeah. Yeah. They

160
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:26.450
were amazing. And, and we
also had other sponsors such

161
00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:32.210
as dev express Telerik and
for just sticks. TechSmith was

162
00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:35.660
a huge sponsor because they
gave us temptation licenses. So

163
00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:41.390
we can do local recordings,
nimble prose code project. It

164
00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:43.610
was just, you know, on
and on that that we

165
00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:46.430
were able to get some
money and funding to actually

166
00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:50.180
make this happen. And obviously
Microsoft was the big sponsor

167
00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:54.320
there because they provide a
channel nine and next time

168
00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.360
and you know, obviously John's
time as well for us

169
00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:00.890
to get all this orchestration
going. That's pretty cool. That's

170
00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:03.140
pretty cool. From a money
point of view, you know,

171
00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:06.740
the channel nine folks just
said, here's what, here are

172
00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:09.320
our costs. And they kind
of just passed them over

173
00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:12.140
to us. And Javier paid
them, you know, out of

174
00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:15.380
our donation budget. And we
actually also had donations. We

175
00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:18.980
had an option during the
registration process where you could

176
00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.290
buy a free ticket or
you could choose to donate

177
00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:25.490
if you wanted to. And
so we had some people

178
00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:28.970
choose to donate, which was
cool. And then the, you

179
00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:31.700
know, with money leftover after
donations, we're going to donate

180
00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:34.250
some of that money to
the jQuery project. So we

181
00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:36.170
just thought that was kind
of a great, you know,

182
00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:38.900
it's kind of a whole
open source feel from beginning

183
00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:41.990
to end with this it's
community run, it's free, it's

184
00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:47.090
volunteer speakers. And, and so
we just thought that it

185
00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:48.860
would be great at the
end of that. If, if

186
00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:50.840
things all worked out and
we had money left over

187
00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:54.920
to give some of that
to jQuery. Very cool. Yeah.

188
00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:56.570
I was just, I was
really, I was in the

189
00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:58.670
one last year and I
was just kind of sad

190
00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:01.160
to miss this one. It
was the perfect storm for

191
00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.590
me. That's pretty, it's pretty
amazing though, that it works

192
00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:06.230
so nicely to did anything
go wrong? I mean, was

193
00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:08.120
there any, you know, how,
like when you're organizing a

194
00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:10.760
wedding, one thing always goes
wrong. They always say, but

195
00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:12.770
it's usually something that no
one notices were there any

196
00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:19.460
big crises? I think the
biggest crisis was the, we

197
00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:22.580
had one of the tracks
was Steve Sanderson presenting on

198
00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:27.920
NBC scaffolding and it worked,
but it wasn't ideal. He,

199
00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:31.340
we had a presentation that
was relayed from UK over

200
00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:34.460
live meeting and we picked
up the video for it

201
00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:40.430
and presented it over the
smooth streaming. And, and of

202
00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:42.740
course, you know, I mean,
it sounds crazy. So we

203
00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:44.960
actually did a full tech
check with that. We had

204
00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:48.920
Steve sign on, we, we
had live meeting running, we

205
00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:52.280
had the, you know, tested
out audio video, everything worked

206
00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:55.090
beautifully. We were, we were
just shocked at how well

207
00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:57.850
it worked. And then of
course during the actual conference,

208
00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.970
the screen resolution was off.
So I was sitting on

209
00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:06.430
the live meeting relay machine,
like scrolling to keep where

210
00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:09.090
he was typing or w
or, you know, keep everything

211
00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:13.570
in, in the view. And,
and so, and the refresh

212
00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:16.600
rate was low and everything.
So, you know, there's only

213
00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:20.020
so much that we could
do with that, for the

214
00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:24.880
follow on video we're going
to have, you know, we're

215
00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:28.120
going to take the live
meeting, recording, and record and

216
00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:32.560
reprocess that. So that'll be
viewable, but, but the actual

217
00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:35.590
live thing, it, it worked,
but it wasn't as I

218
00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:38.350
think it was a little
jarring going from the absolutely

219
00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:41.380
beautiful crystal clear video that
was in the channel nine

220
00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:45.220
studios to it, a live
meeting presentation, but the content

221
00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:47.770
was so good. I, as
a viewer, I thought it

222
00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:51.300
was amazing. So, Well, yeah.
I mean, if, if, if

223
00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:53.340
that's the worst thing that
happened, then that sounds like

224
00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:56.610
that's nothing at all really.
And the thing that's interesting

225
00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:59.550
is that you can optimize
for the off the offline

226
00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:00.960
viewer. And this is something
that I do in my

227
00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:04.740
presentations actually, when, when drew
Robbins and I were in

228
00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:08.220
Belgium and the Netherlands just
a couple of weeks ago,

229
00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:11.370
where I, where I think
I got sick, we sat

230
00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:14.580
there actually before a presentation
for a a hundred people.

231
00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:17.250
And we said, all right,
who do we optimize this

232
00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:19.320
for? Right. Do we optimize
it for the a hundred

233
00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:20.850
people who are standing in
front of us or do

234
00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:22.620
we optimize it for the
couple of thousand who will

235
00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:25.470
download it? I think that's
a really important thing. And

236
00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:30.120
the fact that, that you're
gonna remaster his video and

237
00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:32.730
optimize for the, you know,
the greater, the greater amount

238
00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:34.950
of people who will eventually
download it over a longer

239
00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:39.660
period of time is the
right thing to do. Yeah.

240
00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:42.990
And that was a great
benefit with TechSmith joining in

241
00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:45.630
to help out because by
giving all the speakers, Camtasia

242
00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:50.010
licenses, they were able to
do local HD recordings and

243
00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:52.140
they could go through and
read it later. And they

244
00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:56.070
could also, if the recording,
for whatever reason, you know,

245
00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:58.710
if they weren't happy with
their presentation or the recording

246
00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:01.050
didn't well, they could just
rerecord it. And we've had

247
00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:04.290
a few cases where that's
happening. So the, exactly like

248
00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:07.050
you're saying that just the
live viewership is great, but

249
00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:10.980
with just about any of
these events that after the

250
00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:15.180
on demand viewership is a
lot greater. So with this,

251
00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:18.540
we had the channel nine
videos since it was smooth

252
00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:22.890
streaming that players stayed up
for awhile afterwards. So after

253
00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:25.770
the conference ended, instead of
waiting for a long time

254
00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:28.830
for videos to be processed,
people could immediately go back

255
00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:30.840
through and watch the keynote
or watching any of the

256
00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:33.480
parts that they'd missed or
wanted to see again. So

257
00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:36.570
I just think smooth streaming,
it's just such an amazing

258
00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:41.430
viewing experience. But then after
that, the channel 19 went

259
00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:44.670
to work and they've already
posted most of our, I

260
00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:49.560
think all of the smooth
streaming films events, and then

261
00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:52.610
we're going through, we've got
a volunteer led by Eric

262
00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:56.840
so well down in Austin.
And he's, he's got volunteers

263
00:14:56.840 --> 00:15:00.440
going through and editing the
live meeting presentations, and they're

264
00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:03.380
chopping off the beginning and
the end and putting a

265
00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:05.840
slate in at the beginning.
And then those will also

266
00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:08.000
go up along with these,
since they're all on HD,

267
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.070
they should all look about
the same quality when they're

268
00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:14.200
all up. Hi, this is
Scott coming to you from

269
00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:17.410
another place in time. Are
you using agile practices to

270
00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:19.630
manage your software development? There's
lots of tools in the

271
00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:21.940
market that manage the steps
of a project, but most

272
00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:24.850
of them focus on individual
roles, get ready for a

273
00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:27.220
solution that caters for the
success of the whole team.

274
00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:31.120
Guys at Tellerik introduced team
pulse. It's an agile project

275
00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:34.690
management tool. That'll help you
gather ideas, estimate plan, track

276
00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:38.590
progress in a common workspace.
Finally, companies, regardless of their

277
00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:40.750
size can use a lightweight
and convenient tool that makes

278
00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:44.170
all the stakeholders work as
a United team. Even if

279
00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:47.590
they're in different countries by
combining intuitive user interface and

280
00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:50.350
the power server light team
poles removes the roadblocks that

281
00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:52.990
you typically face and applying
agile in an effective manner,

282
00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:56.830
no more lost data, no
disparate systems, no lack of

283
00:15:56.830 --> 00:16:01.240
critical analytics regarding the health
philosophy project. See if yourself

284
00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:04.170
get a free copy for
five users in one project

285
00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:10.840

do thank tolerance for supporting

286
00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:15.610
Hansel minutes on their Facebook
fan page, facebook.com/t L E

287
00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:19.600
R I K Tellerik. We
do appreciate it. They wouldn't

288
00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:21.610
be a Hansel minutes. If
there wasn't teller helping us,

289
00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:24.400
how air, how many people
are involved with this. I

290
00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:27.070
mean, you, you, as you
keep describing jobs, John, you

291
00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:29.000
keep saying well, and then
we've got volunteers for that.

292
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.940
And we've got volunteers for
that. How many people are

293
00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:33.220
doing this? We have a
couple of a couple set

294
00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:35.890
of people doing this. The
biggest thing was the live

295
00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:38.050
meeting crowd. And other words,
the team, I called them

296
00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:41.410
the team of ninjas. And
that was like Raj timeout.

297
00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:44.590
Eric, you know, was, he
looked like he was operating

298
00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:46.660
the matrix because he had
a headset and looking at

299
00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:49.540
multiple monitors and trying to
get everything we're going. I

300
00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:54.190
had John V. Peterson and also Eric
soul, who is like John

301
00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:58.240
mentioned organizing the whole video
editing. He was also helping

302
00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.400
out with like meeting and
John Teague. So you might,

303
00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:03.040
you have five people right
there trying to help with

304
00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:07.300
orchestrating all these different things
from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM central.

305
00:17:07.570 --> 00:17:10.120
And obviously these people need
breaks and so forth. And

306
00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:12.460
so if it would have
been for them, you know,

307
00:17:12.850 --> 00:17:18.070
this couldn't have succeeded as
well as it did. Yeah.

308
00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:21.640
It's pretty, it's pretty amazing.
Now, have you seen anything

309
00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:24.640
like this for Silverlight or
for F sharp or for

310
00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:26.830
other things, or, I mean,
I don't, I don't think

311
00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:30.040
I've seen a conference in
the Microsoft space of this

312
00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:33.280
scale in a, in a
couple of years. Can you,

313
00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:36.490
either of you guys think
of a recent example because

314
00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:39.040
it seems like we should
spin up versions of this

315
00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:42.760
for other technologies. Yeah, actually,
it's, that's one of the

316
00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:45.700
things that, that Eric and
I have always talked about

317
00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:48.880
is that we wanted to
create, you know, create more

318
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:53.400
than this for just MVC.
Right? So we, we were

319
00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:56.190
talking about something like we
have comp, which is more,

320
00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:59.130
no more related web technologies,
maybe some jQuery, maybe some

321
00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:02.190
web matrix in there, or
other pieces of it. And

322
00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:07.050
we've seen other, other conferences
like that, but nothing in

323
00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:09.720
the virtual world, you know,
like there's Ruby confidence, it's

324
00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:14.010
something you actually have to
physically be there, but it's

325
00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:16.020
more of that, you know,
how do you provide this

326
00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:18.540
large amount of content? And
the closest one that I

327
00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:23.370
can think of is the
Silverlight Firestarter right. That John

328
00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:27.420
Papa just had recently at,
at the Microsoft campus, but,

329
00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:30.060
but that's, but that's still
more of a, it's a

330
00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:33.510
one track thing. Right. And
I logged on, I took

331
00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:35.340
a look at it and
it was, it was actually

332
00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:39.090
great experiences. She is that
way, but this is more

333
00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:45.120
of an interactive one-on-one right.
Hopefully we can, you know,

334
00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:46.550
work out some of the
kinks that we have at

335
00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:49.020
and try to make it
more streamlined and more process.

336
00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:52.620
Cause we really, we really
don't have a secret sauce

337
00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:55.740
yet where we're working towards
it. Know we're just adding

338
00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:58.560
more elements to it and
then see what hits and

339
00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:02.100
what people like. And hopefully
we can mass produce it

340
00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:05.690
even more to other things.
Yeah. It'd be interesting to

341
00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:09.080
see like a dotnet open
source cough and have no

342
00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:13.250
popular open source projects present
how, how to use their

343
00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:15.650
libraries. Right. You know, get
like the Elmont guy, get

344
00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:19.010
the in hibernate guys, get
the Autofac guys or whatever,

345
00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:21.710
and have them put together
a bunch of content. And

346
00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:22.940
you could have, you know,
you got to fucking say

347
00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:24.650
four or five tracks and
people from all over the

348
00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:28.700
place. Yep. To know now
what you've done is you

349
00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:30.470
made our work a lot
harder. Cause Eric is gonna

350
00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:32.480
listen to the podcast and
says, he's going to tell

351
00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:37.460
me we need to do
open source comp. So that's

352
00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:39.650
probably, you know, that's a
great idea. That's probably one

353
00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:41.660
of the next ones to
do on, on the docket.

354
00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:44.060
Cause I think at that
point, everybody benefits from it.

355
00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:47.960
Well, yeah, it'd be really
interesting. And it's it's, I

356
00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:49.630
like that it's a code
camp. I mean, I I've

357
00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:52.400
had more fun at code
game and I like mix

358
00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.840
and I like tech ed,
but honestly I've had more

359
00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:57.590
fun at local code camps
than really anywhere. There's just

360
00:19:57.590 --> 00:20:00.260
a, it's just a community
feel. But one of the

361
00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:02.450
things that I think we
should talk about is that

362
00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:06.920
NBC comp well, well, virtual,
isn't just a bunch of

363
00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:11.030
Smarties streaming video out to,
to me, the, the viewer,

364
00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:14.690
there's also multiple feedback mechanisms.
And I think that's, what's

365
00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:17.870
significant because a number of
people really felt like MVC

366
00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:21.800
comp was very, you know,
very community focused and very

367
00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:25.190
two way. Why was it
two way? What were the

368
00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:27.950
multiple ways that you could
communicate back and forth to

369
00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:31.520
either the person who's speaking
or the people who are

370
00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:35.060
quote unquote sitting next to
you? Well, the, one of

371
00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:37.040
the biggest things we try
to do is we try

372
00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:40.730
to leverage as many channels
of communication as possible specifically

373
00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:44.510
channels that a developer might,
might be most more apt

374
00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:48.100
to use. One of them
obviously is being right. So

375
00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:53.230
for, for the live streaming
sessions, we had people tweet

376
00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:56.590
questions for like Ski-Doo during
his keynote or Brett Wilson

377
00:20:56.590 --> 00:21:01.120
and even plan block. And
one of the things that

378
00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:03.760
we did is actually John
was the machine at this.

379
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.950
He, we had a, a
laptop plugged into a teleprompter

380
00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:13.510
inside the studio. So John
will be scanning like crazy

381
00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:15.940
the Twitter feed, trying to
find a question for, you

382
00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:18.910
know, for the speaker at
the time and retype and

383
00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:21.130
try to make sense out
of the tweet and then

384
00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:25.180
converted into a question. And
so then it was interesting.

385
00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:27.190
Cause as soon as John
was typing it, you could

386
00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:28.930
hear somebody saying, Oh, and
we have a question from

387
00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:32.170
Twitter. It was like, it
was sort of a weird,

388
00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:36.640
weird echo, but, but cool
at the same time to

389
00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:40.160
provide that mechanism and the
other ones, it was, it

390
00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:43.350
was really wild to hear
that real time, just like

391
00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:45.930
question comes in from Twitter
seconds later, I would type

392
00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:48.210
it up and it was
actually just a big LCD

393
00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:50.850
screen hooked up to word
pads. And so I'm just

394
00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:53.250
typing it in and a
huge font. And then boom,

395
00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:55.320
it's up on the screen.
And you could hear immediately

396
00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:57.900
the speaker just address the
question. I thought it was

397
00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:05.960
beautiful how quick that flow
was. Literally. It was the

398
00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:08.760
big thing was that it
wasn't as big as this

399
00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:12.690
year because I think people
were more, there was more

400
00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:17.130
interaction on Twitter then there
than before is that we

401
00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:22.620
did had an IRC channel
where on Freenode where people

402
00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:25.830
can go and have that
conversation. I know that the

403
00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:28.590
first NBC comp Brad Wilson
from the ESPN and that

404
00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:31.500
team was just crazy answering
questions and sort of help

405
00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:35.700
drive the conversation there. And
we call it our hallway.

406
00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:37.800
Right. You know, cause I
know that I haven't been

407
00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:40.380
to Mex, but people who
have been to mix have

408
00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:43.500
always said that the best
conversations were on the hallway.

409
00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:46.080
You know, when you're in
a, whether you're talking to

410
00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:49.680
a fellow attendee or a,
the speaker afterwards. And so

411
00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:54.150
we kinda wanted to drive
that same interaction and IRC

412
00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:58.200
provided a mechanism for that.
And we also had individual

413
00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:01.830
IRC channels for each room.
But like I said, since

414
00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:03.900
we had Twitter and people
were, it was more apt

415
00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:06.060
to see the Twitter feeds
and see that. I think

416
00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:10.410
that was a, a more
cleaner mechanism of consuming them.

417
00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:23.400
The data that the IRC
yep. It's slight drop off.

418
00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:27.030
It wasn't a, it wasn't
as, as high as it

419
00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:29.400
was before, because I don't
think we had as much

420
00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:31.500
focus on it. I think
our biggest focus and this

421
00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:34.320
one was the live streaming
and making sure that went

422
00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:38.820
off without a hitch, because
the main reason that was

423
00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:41.310
is because like John mentioned
earlier, is that scalability issues.

424
00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:44.400
We have the live meeting,
right. With live streaming. We

425
00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:47.060
can scale, you know, and
clients as compared to light

426
00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:50.420
beings, we were tapped. And
so it was more of

427
00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:53.210
like, let's get that right.
We know we got IRC

428
00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:55.070
right from the first one.
And then we know it's

429
00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:57.590
working this one, so let's
work on this next piece

430
00:23:57.590 --> 00:24:02.420
of the puzzle and shift
that. So right. Like with

431
00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:06.140
the IRC last year, we
had a say for instance,

432
00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:09.170
we have this team behind
the scenes that are starting

433
00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:12.350
and stopping the live meeting
sessions. So they would introduce

434
00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:15.860
the speaker, they would start
the server side recording of

435
00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:18.980
the video and then they
would take questions and feed

436
00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:21.290
them to the speaker. But
also while they were doing

437
00:24:21.290 --> 00:24:23.870
that, they were involved in
the IRC web chat. So

438
00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:25.760
they kind of kept it
going. So that was one

439
00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:27.290
of the things that have
the air. And I did.

440
00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:29.810
And this year we were
so busy in the channel

441
00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:32.000
nine studios. We weren't as
able to be involved in

442
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.880
that. So I think, you
know, that, and then just

443
00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:37.940
the combination of, I think
the conversation really just moved

444
00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:40.790
over to Twitter this year,
as opposed to IRC as

445
00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:44.000
much. And you know, I've
been thinking about that. There's

446
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.590
possibly ability to like that's
a place to improve or

447
00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:51.920
scale up in the next
one is to have more

448
00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:54.980
of, you know, like I've
seen Sarah chips has done

449
00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:57.380
this thing where she's had
this land party and people

450
00:24:57.380 --> 00:25:00.560
just kind of log on
and it's video chat. There

451
00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:03.260
could be, you know, open
space or there could be

452
00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:05.660
like kind of just a
meetup thing going on during

453
00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:08.660
the conference there as well,
because you've got all your

454
00:25:09.050 --> 00:25:11.840
friends, you've got all these
people that are really passionate

455
00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:14.930
about this technology all in
one place. And it does

456
00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:18.650
seem like there's an opportunity
for more, if we'd also

457
00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:23.600
talked about something like having
a hackathon follow or proceed

458
00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:26.600
the conference. And so, you
know, as soon as the

459
00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:29.900
conference is over or maybe
as a final session, some,

460
00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:33.110
some people who were leading
open source projects say, Hey,

461
00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:35.420
we'd like to add on
this big feature or we'd

462
00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:37.460
like to do a bug
bash or something like that.

463
00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:40.010
That's all jump on or
you know, that kind of

464
00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:44.000
thing. And so, I mean,
there's definitely social improvement areas

465
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.630
here, but you know, limitation
of how much we can

466
00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:51.250
grow each ones. Right, right.
Yeah. Another idea would be

467
00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:57.370
to have a one or
two local conferences in each

468
00:25:57.370 --> 00:26:00.670
time zone simultaneous to the
scan, to the, to the

469
00:26:00.670 --> 00:26:04.990
video, which I know that
the Firestarter people did where

470
00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:07.690
you'd have like 20 guys
in Australia get together at

471
00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:11.650
the local office and, and
be there physically. So you

472
00:26:11.650 --> 00:26:14.680
could have thousands of people
who are viewing via live

473
00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:16.840
meaning, and then thousands of
people all over the world

474
00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:20.980
that are getting meeting at
universities or offices and just,

475
00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:22.840
just to have 20 or
30 people in the same

476
00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:26.590
room to talk to. So
they could have a little

477
00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:29.560
conference experience there as well.
Yeah. So it's funny you

478
00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:31.540
say that because actually that
was one of the items

479
00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:33.670
who wanted to do it.
And we wanted to leverage

480
00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:37.150
a DPE developer and platform
band to listen for that.

481
00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:40.090
And unfortunately, because of everything
else that we had going

482
00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:42.640
on, and that was, you
know, it was, it was

483
00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:44.730
like it just shipping software,
right. It falls down to

484
00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:47.190
the bottom of the priority
list because we have other

485
00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:50.130
pending items. But I think
for the next one, that's

486
00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:51.390
kind of one of the
things we want to do.

487
00:26:51.390 --> 00:26:56.340
We've been getting pinged by
Clark South from VPE that

488
00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:58.980
he wants to do that
in the Chicago office. And

489
00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:01.260
I know that, you know,
Eric was in the Austin

490
00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:05.550
office. So all the people
who were there were already

491
00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:08.550
there viewing it. And we
partially did an on the

492
00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:11.850
first one, but now it's
getting more of an orchestration

493
00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:15.240
around that. So that way,
if as a speaker are

494
00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:18.720
close to a, you know,
to the multipurpose room that

495
00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:22.500
the office may have at
that location, then you can

496
00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:25.050
leverage, you know, the full
bandwidth and air and every

497
00:27:25.050 --> 00:27:27.540
other resource in there and
really do a presentation. And

498
00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:30.120
at the same time broadcast
it to whoever wants to

499
00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:34.700
see it. Yeah. I think,
I think that, you know

500
00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:36.890
what I think you guys
need to do, and this

501
00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:40.370
is just, you know, I
say this again, flat on

502
00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:45.530
my back without thinking, you
need to write up a

503
00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:50.810
little 20 page PDF ebook
about hosting your own virtual

504
00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:54.110
conference and make it like
a cookbook. You know, here's

505
00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:57.350
the recipe, you know, this
is promotion and this is

506
00:27:57.350 --> 00:28:00.770
streaming and here's the tech
and here's getting sponsors and

507
00:28:00.770 --> 00:28:03.770
here's how you manage the
finance. I think that there'd

508
00:28:03.770 --> 00:28:05.750
be a lot of value
in that. I mean, you

509
00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:09.080
guys have that knowledge now
because you've done it twice,

510
00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:11.870
but you know, maybe there's
someone out there who wants

511
00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:15.020
to do this for SharePoint
or, or good or whatever.

512
00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:18.560
And they may have even
tried to kick it off,

513
00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:20.210
but it hasn't gotten to
the size that they want

514
00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:23.540
it to because there's some
hard one knowledge that you

515
00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:25.880
guys have in your heads
that they don't have. I

516
00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:28.670
think the big trick is
keeping it free too, because

517
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.830
just about any of these
things, you want to do

518
00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:34.880
the costs start adding up.
So the balance of keeping

519
00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:37.490
your costs low and bringing
in the sponsorship to cover

520
00:28:37.490 --> 00:28:41.180
it is tricky. I've seen
other online conferences, but they

521
00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:43.370
usually end up costing, you
know, a hundred, few hundred

522
00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:47.810
dollars, which is okay, it's,
it's definitely, you know, a

523
00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:50.390
lot less than you'd pay
for a, an in person

524
00:28:50.390 --> 00:28:54.110
conference, including all the travel
and all that. But it's

525
00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:58.100
the, that magical free price
point where you can get,

526
00:28:58.310 --> 00:29:00.650
you know, thousands of people
to get their boss to

527
00:29:00.650 --> 00:29:02.720
agree, to let them sit
there for a few hours

528
00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:05.390
and watch a show it's
kind of magical. So, I

529
00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:09.890
mean, it's, I think I
said magical twice, but it's

530
00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:12.320
double magical. And so the,
you know, getting it to

531
00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:15.170
free is a, is a
real trick. Yeah. And, and

532
00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:16.730
the funny part about all
this guy that did the

533
00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:18.920
logistics, I was thinking this
on my way to Seattle

534
00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:21.650
was that only two people
that really had to travel

535
00:29:21.650 --> 00:29:26.240
for this conference and that
was Don and myself, everybody

536
00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:28.610
else was home. You know,
maybe someone had to go

537
00:29:28.610 --> 00:29:31.190
somewhere to get a faster
internet connection, but it probably,

538
00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:36.110
it wasn't anything beyond, you
know, couple a mile or

539
00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:38.780
less than a mile. But
John and I were the

540
00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:40.730
only ones who actually had
to get on a plane,

541
00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:42.820
you know, say bye to
our families for a couple

542
00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:46.150
of days and stay in
a hotel bed to make

543
00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:49.450
all this happen. So it
was, it was pretty, pretty

544
00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:51.010
cool. Right. If you stop
and think about, you know,

545
00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:54.300
from that perspective. Yeah. That
is, that is pretty amazing.

546
00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:57.960
That is pretty amazing. Interesting.
So where can people go

547
00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:00.720
and hear about this, about
these sessions that they missed,

548
00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:03.180
John, where can I work?
And I watched the videos

549
00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:06.650
now, So we're working on
getting all the other videos.

550
00:30:06.650 --> 00:30:09.450
So as we mentioned before,
Eric, Eric is, is I'm

551
00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:12.600
working around the clock on
this, on this free time,

552
00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:15.240
along with all the volunteers
to get the encoding of

553
00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:17.910
his videos up and running.
So we're, we're going to

554
00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:22.290
be hosting everything on channel
nine. So right now we

555
00:30:22.290 --> 00:30:28.500
have the Scott goo keynote,
Phil hacks, but Wilson's and

556
00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:32.190
Glenn blocks presentation out and
channel nine available. And we

557
00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:33.270
can put, you know, we
can give you the link

558
00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:34.500
for that. So you can
put it on the show

559
00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:40.380
and MBC comp.com be updated.
So it has all of

560
00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:43.980
these things at some point.
Absolutely. Exactly. Yeah. That would

561
00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:45.630
be a good, that would
be a good place for

562
00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:47.580
people that just want to
learn about what's there and

563
00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:49.620
also to see the list
of all the sessions and

564
00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:53.340
all that. Is it empty
for@covid.com? Yep. Hmm. And, and

565
00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:55.080
can I go there now
and see last year sessions

566
00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:58.500
as well? Yeah. Yep. Yep.
There's a link on the

567
00:30:58.500 --> 00:30:59.970
lower left hand side that
you can click on and

568
00:30:59.970 --> 00:31:02.790
go back to the previous
content. So, All right. Very

569
00:31:02.790 --> 00:31:04.860
cool. Well, this is great.
Well, do me a favor

570
00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:07.470
and give me the list
of the people that were

571
00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:10.590
involved and the, the sponsors
again, Javier. So, so people

572
00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:15.300
know how many people worked
on this thing. I don't

573
00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:16.740
know, like list it out
right now. I want to,

574
00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:19.290
I think people, Oh, sorry
about that was rash. Kamow

575
00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:25.920
John V. Peterson. Eric. So John T
and R our platinum sponsor

576
00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:29.790
was Umbraco tobacco project. We
had COVID project. We had

577
00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:36.600
Infragistics we had dev express.
We also had obviously Microsoft

578
00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:44.070
and TechSmith, I think Tellerik
Oh, yes. Sorry. My fault.

579
00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:47.640
So, yeah. Telarc was also
a great sponsor. Yeah. Well,

580
00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:50.040
I got, I got, I
got to thank them or

581
00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:54.270
they'll shut me down. Exactly.
No one other, one other

582
00:31:54.270 --> 00:31:57.030
sponsor that we had was
Pluralsight just in that they

583
00:31:57.030 --> 00:32:00.750
agreed to open up their
MPC training. They had done

584
00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:03.120
a promotion a few weeks
ago, where they had some

585
00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:06.870
MPC training by case Scott Allen
available for 24 hours. And

586
00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:09.120
so I just ping them
and said, Hey, do you

587
00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:10.860
want to do that again?
As a follow on. So

588
00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:13.530
people after they finished blowing
their minds with the day

589
00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:16.290
at MPC conference, learn more
and go deeper with it.

590
00:32:16.530 --> 00:32:18.780
So they open that up
for another 40 or 48

591
00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:23.700
hours. Well, thanks you guys.
And thanks. So Eric extra,

592
00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:26.970
who couldn't be with us
today and I'll put up

593
00:32:26.970 --> 00:32:29.310
links to all this and
on the show notes. So

594
00:32:29.310 --> 00:32:32.910
thanks again, everybody for putting
on NBC con. Thank you

595
00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:37.080

show. All right. This has

596
00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:40.220
been another episode of Hansel
minutes, and I'll see You

597
00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:48.310
again next week. <inaudible>.
