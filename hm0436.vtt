a weekly discussion with web
developer and technologist Scott Hanselman.

9
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.000
This is Lawrence Ryan announcing show
number four 36. In this

10
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.840
episode, Scott talks with Gilbert
creator, Scott Adams about his new

11
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:07.290
startup calendar tree. Hi, this
is Scott Hanselman. This is

12
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.570
another episode of Hansel minutes,
and I am chatting with

13
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.080
Scott Adams. He's the creator of
the Dilbert comic strip, and

14
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.050
now has a new startup
called calendar tree. Thanks for

15
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.420
chatting with me today, sir.
Thanks for having me. So

16
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.620
one of the things about
Dilbert that's so interesting is

17
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.100
how, how it resonates with
reality. And we always kind

18
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.670
of assumed that you were
working in a startup pretty

19
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.490
much for the last 20
years. How did you keep

20
00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.970
the voice so authentic? Were
you working with office people

21
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.450
at the time? Well, it's
a combination of things. So

22
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.110
the first, I guess, eight
years of my career, I

23
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.800
actually had a day job.
So I've been pulling from

24
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.830
those memories. Plus a lot
of people email me and

25
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.520
say, could you please embarrass
my boss? He desperately needs

26
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.330
it and I'm always happy
to help. And then more

27
00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.770
recently I've always had a
variety of side businesses. I

28
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.520
owned restaurants for awhile. I
started a food company. I've

29
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.900
tried a different variety of
software related things, and now

30
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.620
doing the calendar tree startup
kind of always in the

31
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.830
business world, you know, I'm
still having those same business

32
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.460
meetings and I'm still trying
to set objectives and all

33
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.250
those things that I write
about. And are you the

34
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.780
pointy haired boss? Now I
try to avoid having anything

35
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.740
that looks like management authority
because I'm pretty sure I'm

36
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.110
terrible at it. It's really
easy to make fun of

37
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.070
people, you know, who do
it wrong. But I honestly

38
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.890
think that to be a
really great manager, you've got

39
00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.290
to have at least some
minimum level of evil in

40
00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.460
you because, because the whole
point of managing right and

41
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.970
leadership in general is getting
people to do something that

42
00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.520
they didn't want to do
on their own. So if

43
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.700
it was simply a matter
of informing them, then you

44
00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.410
wouldn't need a manager. So
you need somebody to actually

45
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.100
manipulate people to act against
what they believe would have

46
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.940
been their own best interest
you with some convoluted argument

47
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.190
about how this will pay
off in the future. So

48
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.100
there's a little bit of
evil in that that I

49
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.290
can fully embrace. So I
can never really be a

50
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.630
good manager. So it is
manipulation. Good management is excellent

51
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.070
manipulation. Yeah. Manipulation is one
of those words that makes

52
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.430
you think it's automatically bad,
but in fact, we're all

53
00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.640
manipulating our environment for good
or bad. That's what we

54
00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.760
do as humans. But certainly
if you're a manager, you're

55
00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.940
trying to get people to
do things differently than they

56
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.130
were going to do on
their own. And what they

57
00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.320
were going to do on
their own was probably what

58
00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.080
they thought was good for
them. So really you are

59
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.290
talking them into doing something
that you hope they will

60
00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.720
believe is good for them
in the long run, but

61
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.450
really it's good for you
and good for the company,

62
00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.150
probably. So when you run
your startup, are you the

63
00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.540
benevolent dictator? Like let's all
talk about it. We'll vote

64
00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.180
and then I'll decide anything.
No, we don't get that

65
00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:05.370
far. You know, my, my
cofounder when Parker and I,

66
00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.190
we, we make decisions together,
but I w I was

67
00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.770
quite clear that I wanted
him to be the CEO,

68
00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:15.570
partly because he has those
skills and partly because I'm

69
00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:19.530
terrible at it. So ultimately
he's the decision maker, but

70
00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:25.080
there, we also have equity
holders from Australia, blue Chile

71
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.750
who helped us get started.
They did the, the tech

72
00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.400
and they maintained a equity
portion. So we've always got

73
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.000
enough smart people to weigh
in. And so far we're

74
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.570
all pretty data driven people.
So the, the best idea

75
00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.480
usually emerges. We haven't had
too much in the way

76
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.420
of disagreements. Hmm. Are you
doing a lot of like

77
00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.820
AB testing to make sure
things are correct, or when

78
00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.160
you're using the data to
drive the business, what kind

79
00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.680
of data you collect? Oh,
I just mean in terms

80
00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.530
of a conversation over, should
we do a, or should

81
00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.070
we do B we're all
pretty rational people. So we

82
00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.280
tend to drive that discussion
toward all right. Has anybody

83
00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.340
tried a, how did that
work out? You know, what

84
00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.380
are the odds that they
would work compared to the

85
00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.110
odds of the B? So
we're just fairly rational people.

86
00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.870
And when you're all rational,
things work out well, you

87
00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.990
know, the thing I write
about in Dilbert is always

88
00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.630
that there's always the crazy
person in the office, right?

89
00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.010
You have to inject just
one a-hole into a, into

90
00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:27.330
another wise rational situation and
everything breaks down. What if,

91
00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.430
but if you have three
people in the room and

92
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.260
that's usually how many we
have, you know, three or

93
00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.100
four, and you're all rational
creatures, we're working toward a

94
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:38.820
common solution. You really don't
get a lot of disagreements,

95
00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.560
as long as you're willing
to look at the facts.

96
00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.260
That is the goal. That
is the goal. Unfortunately though,

97
00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:48.020
a-hole driven development or add
somehow seems to it to

98
00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.880
happen. So often I have
found sometimes when I I'm

99
00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.790
convinced that everyone on my
team is in a hole.

100
00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:58.700
It's usually in fact that
it's Yes. Yeah. I know

101
00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:02.300
that feeling. I usually think
it's me. I go to

102
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:07.510
that first. Yeah. So what
does calendar tree do? So

103
00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:11.620
Kellen Dimitri was developed as
a solution to a very

104
00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:16.180
specific problem. And the problem
is, and probably every adult

105
00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.970
who at least owns a
smartphone has had this problem,

106
00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:22.270
which is you're involved in
some club or organization, or

107
00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:24.430
maybe your kids are in
a club or a team

108
00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:27.850
or an organization, and some
organizer or a coach sends

109
00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:32.380
you a list of all
the, all the games, meetings,

110
00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.990
and practices. And you've got
this huge list that had

111
00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:37.060
arrived in email. And now
what are you going to

112
00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.340
do with it? Like, do
you have to thumb type

113
00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:40.750
it into your phone? So
you have it on your

114
00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:43.540
calendar, you put it on
the wall, but you're never

115
00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:45.730
in the room where it's
hanging on the wall. So

116
00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:48.880
you've got this problem. So
a calendar DRI does is

117
00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:54.520
let that organizer enter the,
the series of events into

118
00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:57.610
calendar tree, and then send
that out as a link

119
00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.580
either by email, or it
could be by, you know,

120
00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:05.260
Facebook posting or Twitter or
LinkedIn, and then anybody, anybody

121
00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.140
who gets the link can
click on it. And whether

122
00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:12.790
they have Google calendar or
Apple or outlook, they can

123
00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:16.360
add that entire series of
events to their existing calendar

124
00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:19.150
with just a few keystrokes.
So what we do is

125
00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:21.700
we let you keep your
existing calendar that you're already

126
00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.490
happy with. It's already doing
what you want and just

127
00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:28.840
easily add large incoming series
of events that you're interested

128
00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:32.170
in. So that it's not
a second calendar. They are

129
00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:34.840
the events themselves that kind
of come into your calendar.

130
00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:39.160
You're already using. Yeah. Are
unfortunately we probably made a

131
00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.970
mistake naming the company because
our name is calendar tree,

132
00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:45.550
but we were thinking more
about the tree part, the

133
00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:49.540
connection part. Then we were
thinking about the calendar. So

134
00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:52.030
we're not a calendar. We're
a way that easily get

135
00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:56.590
large blocks of events stuff
onto your calendar, no matter

136
00:07:56.590 --> 00:08:00.760
what kind you have now,
secondarily, once we've connected to

137
00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:03.400
your calendar, once you've given
us permission to do that

138
00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.940
and edit, then when the
organizer has a change to

139
00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:10.840
the schedule, that change will
flow automatically to your calendar

140
00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:14.860
with an email notification that
just says this change happened.

141
00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:19.150
It's it's already on here.
Oh, okay. So I just

142
00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:24.100
recently joined our HOA, which
is both good and bad.

143
00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:27.100
And so I'm the guy
on the HOA. And one

144
00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:28.450
of the things we've been
struggling with is trying to

145
00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:30.310
figure out how we're going
to get everyone to know

146
00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:33.520
when the events are, we've
got, you know, public meetings

147
00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.560
and we have to, we
have to there's legal rules

148
00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:37.390
for us to say, we're
having a meeting and everyone

149
00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:39.760
knows where it is. I
could put a year's worth

150
00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:43.300
of the HOA and calendar
tree, and people could subscribe

151
00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:48.310
to that. Yeah, Absolutely. Now,
in that specific example, you

152
00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:51.430
might have trouble getting people
to care about the HOA

153
00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:55.000
meetings. So, so in those
cases, that that might be

154
00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:57.780
a better case where people
do want maybe a separate

155
00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:00.390
calendar or if they need
it, they can go to

156
00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:04.710
it where a calendar tree
really sparkles is if it's

157
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:09.030
your kid's soccer team and
mom has the schedule, but

158
00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:11.220
dad doesn't, wouldn't it be
great if everybody had it,

159
00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:15.150
including the kid on their
own phone and maybe grandma

160
00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:17.460
wants to see the schedule
to, you know, why can't

161
00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:19.740
I grab my come to
the home games? So when

162
00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:21.990
you're talking about stuff that,
you know, you want every

163
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:24.330
one of those items on
your calendar, and there's not

164
00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.400
one thing on there that
you don't really care about.

165
00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:31.440
That's where we're, we're helpful
HOA. Your real problem is

166
00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:35.730
getting people to care. Right.
And that's, that's the calendars

167
00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:38.630
that your biggest problem. Ah,
that's interesting. So I just

168
00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:41.690
got an email yesterday from
our, my kids community school,

169
00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:43.490
which we all do care
about, and it was a

170
00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:47.930
PDF Oh. Of the year's
events that looked like it

171
00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:51.950
had been. Yeah, exactly. It
was quite, I mean, God

172
00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:54.650
bless them for trying, but
it was rather cobbled together.

173
00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:57.170
And then the best part
you're going to like this

174
00:09:57.410 --> 00:10:01.580
the day after was the
apology for the incorrect PDF.

175
00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:04.250
Apparently all of the dates
have been shifted over by

176
00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:07.310
one a and Friday was
actually a Thursday. So they

177
00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:09.950
had redone the entire PDF
and sent it out to

178
00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:14.270
us. Yeah. Right now, multiply
that by every organization that

179
00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:17.600
you're in every organization that
your family members are in,

180
00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.910
because you kind of usually
need to keep track of

181
00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:22.970
that too. And every one
of them is a mess.

182
00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:25.820
Right now, calendar tree is
the only thing that solves

183
00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:29.450
that problem. Okay. Okay. So
then it's, it's, it looks

184
00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:31.850
like it's free. The current
pricing is it's free for

185
00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:34.340
50 calendar connections. So that
would be people that are

186
00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:36.980
connected to that calendar. Yeah.
So if you're a small

187
00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:42.470
organization it's free and once
you get to large organizations

188
00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:44.510
who find it useful, I
mean, if you have more

189
00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:47.990
than 50 people connected to
your calendar, that probably has

190
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.230
real business value to you.
And for a few bucks,

191
00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:53.840
a few bucks a year,
you'd be happy to use

192
00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:56.690
that. So you said that
you'd started a number of

193
00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:59.440
companies before, whether it be
software or you said you

194
00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:03.470
also, some restaurants, is this
just something where writing a,

195
00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:07.460
a cartoon or two a
day is just too challenging

196
00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:09.740
and you have to challenge
yourself even more. I just

197
00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:12.650
assume that when you're a
famous, cartoonist, you write your

198
00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:15.320
cartoon and you go to
the beach. Yeah. A lot

199
00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:19.010
of people think that, well,
here's the complicated answer to

200
00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:21.890
that. Number one, I really
like the beach. I don't

201
00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:26.090
even like vacation. I don't
like the feeling of sitting

202
00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:30.020
around being useless. And, you
know, I was raised by

203
00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:33.530
parents who said, you know,
whatever you do just be

204
00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:38.240
useful, you know, add something
and I'm terribly uncomfortable doing

205
00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:40.310
nothing I can do. I
can do it for a

206
00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:43.100
day. I can do it
for maybe three days, but

207
00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.010
you know, vacations don't work
for me. So I'm not

208
00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:50.630
big on free time. Right.
That's the first thing. And

209
00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:55.330
secondly, it's very synergistic, synergistic.
I hate to use that

210
00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:59.470
word since I mock it.
But in order to be

211
00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:02.350
a good cartoonist or a
good writer, you have to

212
00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:05.560
have another part of your
life, which is filling you

213
00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:09.130
with ideas. It's giving you
the, the complexity and the

214
00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:11.920
diversity of thought that you're
not going to get sitting

215
00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:14.650
in a room staring at
your computer. So I need

216
00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:16.120
to get out and mix
it up with the real

217
00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:22.420
world. But beyond that, especially
with calendar tree, sometimes you

218
00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:25.150
see a problem and you
say, alright, nobody's going to

219
00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:29.560
fix that, but I could,
I could fix that problem.

220
00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:34.360
And it's a problem that's
as close to universal as

221
00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:36.100
a problem could be, which
is how do I get

222
00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:37.750
this stuff at my calendar?
So I knew where to

223
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:40.870
be. It's not going away.
It's not getting less by

224
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:44.020
itself. Somebody had to fix
it. And so we, we

225
00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:46.870
started by looking around to
see who had already done

226
00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:49.450
it. That was our first
choice. The first choice was

227
00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:52.810
just used someone else's thing,
but it didn't exist. Now.

228
00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:55.210
It turns out it was
really hard. It was hard

229
00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:57.370
to build this thing. It
took two years to get

230
00:12:57.370 --> 00:12:59.020
it right. And a lot
of that had to do

231
00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:03.040
with tweaking the interface until
people could understand this thing,

232
00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:06.250
which wasn't like things they
had used before. How do

233
00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.380
you walk them through it
in a way that, you

234
00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:12.730
know, the average mind follows
in the same sequence of,

235
00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:18.670
of learning. So we got
that and we hope we

236
00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:21.610
can solve this fairly large
problem. And we've got a

237
00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:24.430
number of smaller features that
we're looking to add to

238
00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:28.810
this set of solutions that
would be likewise useful in

239
00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:33.360
slightly different. And time-related scheduling
related fields. You had done

240
00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.280
some work as a programmer.
You've done all sorts of

241
00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:37.800
different things. But from hearing
you kind of light up

242
00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:39.990
talking about this, it sounds
like you may be a

243
00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:43.530
user experience researcher and looking
at different puzzles, you know,

244
00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:46.320
AB testing and all those
kinds of things. Yeah. I

245
00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.780
love that stuff. Cause I
love the, you know, the

246
00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:52.770
connection between the technology and
the, you know, the human

247
00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:57.000
cognitive, you know, amazing things
that you can never stop

248
00:13:57.030 --> 00:14:00.180
learning. It's sort of this,
this infinite wealth of knowledge

249
00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:02.970
that you, you start falling
down and you think, well,

250
00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:06.200
it must be halfway down
now and you're not you've

251
00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:09.330
you haven't even touched it.
I used to, I used

252
00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:13.200
to work in a group
that did interface testing at

253
00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:16.830
the phone company. So I
kind of got immersed in

254
00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:22.890
that world and started to
love it. But more than

255
00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:26.400
that, I'm actually a kind
of a business model nerd.

256
00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:30.000
If you asked me, what's
my favorite thing to think

257
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.700
about and talk about it
would be, how could I

258
00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:35.400
turn something into a business
that had never been a

259
00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:41.190
business before? My background is
not art. I think most

260
00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:44.100
people know that when they
look at my comic, my

261
00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:48.150
background is economics. I have
a degree in economics. I

262
00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:52.520
have an MBA from Berkeley.
So of my, you know,

263
00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:56.720
core talent is around business
and how to make something

264
00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:59.630
work. And in fact, it's,
it's probably at least half

265
00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:03.350
of the reason that Dilbert
broke out from a crowded

266
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:06.530
field of comics that were
in many cases, better than

267
00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:10.280
mine, but I had enough
business experience that I could

268
00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:14.680
make things happen that weren't
happening for other people. Well,

269
00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:17.500
and speaking of economics and
business, you wrote a book,

270
00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:21.550
not a cartoon compilation book,
but a book more about

271
00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:23.590
business and your experience in
business called how to fail

272
00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:26.470
at almost everything and still
win big. Did you pull

273
00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:30.880
from those aspects of it?
Yeah. That book was a

274
00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:35.680
sort of a public service
sort of thing. Obviously I

275
00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:38.260
want it to be commercially
successful because it gets it

276
00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:41.950
to the most people and
creates the most good. But

277
00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:45.220
the idea was, you know,
I've learned a number of

278
00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:47.950
things because I've been involved
in so many different types

279
00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:52.750
of businesses, everything from art
to technology to, you know,

280
00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:56.650
serious business stuff. And I
thought I wanted to see

281
00:15:56.650 --> 00:15:59.560
if I could capture that.
Now what's unique about my

282
00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:05.350
situation is that probably my
one world-class skill. If I

283
00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:08.230
could say that is that
I'm pretty good at simplifying

284
00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:11.920
things. And that comes from
probably a little bit of

285
00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:14.920
upbringing, but a lot of
practice being a cartoonist and

286
00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:18.310
taking complicated things and putting
it into three sentences every

287
00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:23.110
day. So I thought, well,
when I was 20, I

288
00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:25.690
really didn't have a mentor.
I didn't have anybody who

289
00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:28.890
could give me the basic
model of success. You know,

290
00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:31.240
what's the basic idea. I
know I'm going to tailor

291
00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:34.960
it myself. So my book,
doesn't try to tell people

292
00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:38.380
do it this way. What
I say instead is there

293
00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:39.820
are a lot of people
doing a lot of different

294
00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:42.100
things. Some of them are
working. They're not all going

295
00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:44.230
to be the thing that
works for you, but here's

296
00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:46.810
what I did. And try
to explain it as clearly

297
00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:49.570
as possible. So there's somebody
reading the book and say,

298
00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:51.760
okay, I may not want
to use all of this,

299
00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:54.100
but let me compare it
to what I'm doing. Now,

300
00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:56.470
let me compare it to
what other people are telling

301
00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:59.230
me, which one makes more
sense. And by the way,

302
00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:02.470
if I can test one
against the other, you know,

303
00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:04.480
do it this way for
awhile, how's it work? Do

304
00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:07.660
it this way for awhile.
Why not? So it's a

305
00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:10.060
little bit of a, here's
more stuff to think about.

306
00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:12.730
Here's more stuff to test.
It looks like it worked

307
00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:15.670
for me, but you have
to acknowledge that luck is

308
00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:18.820
a giant factor in all
of this stuff. And I

309
00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:22.720
addressed that fairly directly by
talking about the obvious, which

310
00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:27.190
is, if you do 10
things, you've created a situation

311
00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:30.460
where lucky can find you
a little more readily than

312
00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:34.390
if you did one thing
and out Conversations with people

313
00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:36.970
at startup conferences and you
know, places where people are

314
00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:41.530
doing a side gig or
some kind of moonlighting. And

315
00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:44.530
they always seem to have
one idea that they're doing

316
00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:46.690
on the side that they're
throwing their entire life into.

317
00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:49.090
And I've always said like,
I see what you're doing

318
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:50.820
here, but you're going to
be crushed when that doesn't

319
00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:53.130
work out. So I always
try to have three or

320
00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:57.000
four little ideas that are
going to create passive income

321
00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:59.610
that are going to be,
you know, if one of

322
00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:01.440
them falls apart, it's not
going to be a huge

323
00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:02.910
deal. Like if you were
going to start a consulting

324
00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:06.510
company, you would not want
to have one client, right?

325
00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:09.080
You want to mix it
up, Right? You want diversity

326
00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:11.600
in all things. I mean,
there's there aren't too many

327
00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:14.750
situations where diversity, isn't a
good thing. You know, diversifying

328
00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:19.760
your, your portfolio of whatever
and adding on to what

329
00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:24.710
you just said. History has
shown that there's literally no

330
00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:28.070
one smart enough to predict
what's going to work. All

331
00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:30.860
right. That person hasn't been
born yet, who can look

332
00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:33.230
at an idea and in
its infancy and say, yeah,

333
00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:35.150
that thing is going to
go from a good idea

334
00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:38.730
to a working business model,
to no real competition, to

335
00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:42.410
a monopoly someday. Nobody can
do that. What people can

336
00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:45.200
do to say, okay, you
didn't do anything so stupid

337
00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:47.960
is going to kill you.
All right. It looks good

338
00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:51.260
so far. And then you
did three of them. So

339
00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:54.680
that's smarter. You've increased your
odds. The other thing I

340
00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:56.840
learned and I wrote about
this in the book, you

341
00:18:56.840 --> 00:19:00.110
mentioned a, had a fail
at almost everything and still

342
00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:05.960
win big is that often
you can identify something that's

343
00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:10.250
going to go big by
as X factor. But that

344
00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:12.320
thing that you can't, you
can't really build it in.

345
00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:14.330
Like you can't say, I
want to build some X

346
00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:17.060
factor into this thing. It's
something you, you see after

347
00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:19.220
the fact a little bit,
you know, once it's already

348
00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:23.210
kind of on its way,
but you can detect that

349
00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:27.200
early by how much excitement,
a small number of people

350
00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:31.460
have worked as, as opposed
to a large group of

351
00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:35.600
people all say, that's pretty
good. Then you have nothing.

352
00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:38.300
All right, because I've seen
that over and over again.

353
00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:41.150
If a lot of people
say, yeah, that's a good

354
00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:44.750
idea. And that's pretty good.
You got enough. But if

355
00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:47.780
90% of the people say,
and this applied to Dilbert

356
00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:50.630
and the first few years,
90% of the people say,

357
00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:54.170
that's really awful. That's poorly
drawn, poorly written. It doesn't

358
00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:59.630
apply to me whatsoever. But
here's the important part, 10%

359
00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:02.150
look at that. And they
say, I'm going to have

360
00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:04.610
to cut this out. I'm
going to form my own

361
00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:07.940
book of Dilbert comics based
on the scripts I've selected.

362
00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:10.130
I liked them so much.
I'm going to send them

363
00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:12.560
to my friends. I'm going
to write to the author.

364
00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:15.560
This really, this works for
me. This is touching something.

365
00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:19.760
Then you have something that
you probably can't stop unless

366
00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:22.640
you do something stupid. All
right. So that is going

367
00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:26.450
to grow. So that's what
I look for. I look

368
00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:28.520
for the, you throw it
out there and you see

369
00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:32.300
anybody get excited. See, while
you were saying that, I

370
00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:33.770
just got a little tear
in my eye. Cause I

371
00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:37.700
was thinking about the TV
show Firefly, which is exactly

372
00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:40.010
what you just said. Like,
you know, 10% of us

373
00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:42.710
are like, we worship at
the, at the alter of

374
00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:45.260
Firefly and everyone was like,
I think it's not really

375
00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:48.970
that interesting, but they still
canceled, But they made a

376
00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:52.060
movie. They did make a
movie, which I wanted, which

377
00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:54.200
I watched and enjoyed it
a lot. Very, very much.

378
00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:57.340
Yeah. That in a way,
I guess that might be

379
00:20:57.970 --> 00:21:01.720
one of the exceptions because
that's certainly had, well, you

380
00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:05.830
know, the original star Trek
got poor ratings go yet,

381
00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:09.580
but add the X factor
so much. So that was

382
00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:13.740
formed Trekkies. Yeah. I actually,
I just picked up a

383
00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:17.130
copy of the DVD, special
edition of the search for

384
00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:19.890
Spock over at a garage
sale for $2 a by

385
00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:25.890
someone who did not appreciate
it, Changing And gears a

386
00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:28.350
little bit. I noticed that
you, you had an issue

387
00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:31.620
with your hands and I've
written up extensively on the

388
00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:35.250
programmers hands and I've had
surgery on my right hand

389
00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:38.400
for trigger finger and a
number of tendon issues where

390
00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:40.960
I've been unable to work
because of my hand, what

391
00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:44.670
did happen to your hand?
So what happened was that

392
00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:50.550
when I drew my pinky
finger would involuntarily spasm and

393
00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:54.360
we thought at first it
was just some damage in

394
00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:57.480
the hand, you know, some
kind of carpal tunnel, but

395
00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:04.020
by weird coincidence, the expert
world expert, probably in this

396
00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:07.950
condition that I had lived
in my town and he

397
00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:11.370
was part of the Kaiser
HMO that I used. So

398
00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:13.530
I got referred to him
and he identified it as

399
00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:18.510
a focal dystonia, which is
actually based in the brain.

400
00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:21.960
And one of the ways
you can confirm this is

401
00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:24.270
that when I drew lefthanded,
which I could do a

402
00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:27.300
little bit on mildly ambidextrous,
when as soon as my

403
00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:30.030
left hand hit the page,
my right hand, pinky would

404
00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:33.930
spasm with no, no pattern.
So that's how, that's how,

405
00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:37.830
you know, it's it's brain
and not hand. So when

406
00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:38.970
I, I went to him
and I said, you know,

407
00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:41.220
here's my problem. He diagnosed
me. And I said, what's,

408
00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:44.130
what's the fix? What's the
cure. So surgery I'll get

409
00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:45.330
it. You know, I have
to have this cause I

410
00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:48.150
gotta gotta be able to
draw. And he said, there

411
00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:52.860
isn't a, the fix is
you change careers. And, but

412
00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:56.280
if you'd like, you can
be part of a group

413
00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:59.010
of people who are trying
different things. And if one

414
00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:01.170
of them works, you know,
a little bit of AB

415
00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:03.570
testing, I guess if one
of them works, you'll have

416
00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:05.340
something, would you like to
be part of that? So

417
00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:11.670
I said, yes. So I
tried biofeedback. I tried, you

418
00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:14.640
know, the manipulations of the
hands and various practices and

419
00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:17.220
stuff, and I wasn't getting
any real results. But then

420
00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:20.940
I tried this, I noticed
that when I touched my,

421
00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:24.270
my pen to paper, it
would be just a little

422
00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:27.570
delay before the pinky would
spasm. So during my business

423
00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:30.240
meetings, I was still working
my day job then meeting

424
00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:32.640
in below the table where
nobody could watch, I would

425
00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:36.360
just do this. I'll just
tap my pen to paper

426
00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:39.450
and then remove it before
the spousal. Now I reasoned

427
00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:41.430
that if this was a
brain problem, it could be

428
00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:45.060
reprogrammable. And so eventually I
got that. I can hold

429
00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:48.890
there for a second and
before it would spasm. And

430
00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:51.920
once I got that up
to like five seconds, it

431
00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:57.290
just reprogrammed and went away.
And I believe I was

432
00:23:57.290 --> 00:24:00.380
told I'm in the literature
under not with my own

433
00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:04.700
name as the first case
of a reversal. Now the

434
00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:06.890
trick with that is that
if I continue drawing on

435
00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:10.880
paper with the same regularity
and amount of work, it

436
00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:12.680
would come back and I
felt this start to come

437
00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:16.670
back a little bit. But
I moved when it started

438
00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:18.560
to come back. The last
time I felt a little

439
00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:21.860
twinge of it. I moved
to the Wacom, which is

440
00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:23.810
what I use now. So
I draw directly on the

441
00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:28.280
computer screen. I reasoned that
if my brain is the,

442
00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:31.880
is where this is starting,
that even though I'm using

443
00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:34.310
the same motion with a
stylist that is just like

444
00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:37.490
a pen, that it would
feel different enough that it

445
00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:41.270
wouldn't activate it because it
was just a slightly sort

446
00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:43.640
of a cousin to the
routine. It wasn't close enough.

447
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.130
And that's exactly what happened.
So I can, I can

448
00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:49.160
draw all day on the
computer and it doesn't activate

449
00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:52.190
the pinky. If I write
more than 10 checks in

450
00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:54.860
a row, the pinky starts
to get a little tweak.

451
00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:58.510
That's amazing. I said, I've
been typing for so many

452
00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:00.820
years. I've been typing basically,
you know, full time as

453
00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:04.810
a job, 25 years. I
cannot write, I cannot stand

454
00:25:04.810 --> 00:25:09.310
to write like signing checks
and writing. It's just hands

455
00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:13.360
up. Yeah. I, I, I
have that problem. Plus the

456
00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:16.450
mental thing, which is, if
you don't right, you kind

457
00:25:16.450 --> 00:25:20.650
of forget how so, you
know, all right. I'll be

458
00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:23.290
writing something and I'll think,
I don't think that's even

459
00:25:23.290 --> 00:25:25.930
a letter. I don't even
know what that is. I

460
00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:28.390
was trying to teach my
six year old cursive because

461
00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:31.990
he thinks it's a foreign
language and I've completely lost

462
00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:33.850
cursive. Like, I don't even
know what a cursive are.

463
00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:36.040
It looks like it's just
a line on the way

464
00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:39.760
to another letter. And he's
like, he actually questioned my

465
00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:41.890
ability at curse at my
six year old. Is this

466
00:25:41.890 --> 00:25:44.110
really a thing? Are you
sure? This is how people,

467
00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:47.860
right? Yeah. Yeah. Maybe it
should be teaching him HTML

468
00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:50.470
five or something instead. I
don't know, Frankly. I really,

469
00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:54.990
I really need to. It's
a problem. So in, in

470
00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.430
your day, how much time
do you spend drawing? How

471
00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:59.800
much time do you spend
at calendar tree? And is

472
00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:02.170
this like a startup startup
where you have an office

473
00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:03.730
or do you just hang
out at your kitchen table?

474
00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:09.220
So right now we're, we're
dispersed. We've got some folks

475
00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:11.950
in Australia, my founder and
I are in the same

476
00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:16.570
town and we have a
CTO now and he's, he's

477
00:26:16.570 --> 00:26:18.850
a driving distance away. So
we meet at my house

478
00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:21.730
in my garage, which I
have elephant it as a

479
00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:28.060
proper garage office, very jobs,
very jobs, yen. I thought

480
00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:30.700
the vibe of it being
in being in an actual

481
00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:33.220
garage, but somehow help. And
it's amazing, you know, it

482
00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:37.660
does. There's something about the,
you know, stick to business

483
00:26:37.690 --> 00:26:41.020
nature of a garage that
that does feel right. I,

484
00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:43.620
I actually do feel more
productive out there. Yeah, it

485
00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:46.530
is. It's funny. I put
a, what do you call

486
00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:50.640
it? A treadmill desk together
in the garage. And when

487
00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:53.400
I opened the big double
doors and I'm on the

488
00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:56.580
treadmill desk and I'm deleting
email like a champ, cause

489
00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:59.700
that's my job. It just
has a feeling of like,

490
00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:02.790
I'm going places as I
am not going anywhere. I'm

491
00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:05.400
sitting here doing my little
treadmill and deleting email. I

492
00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:07.080
feel like, you know, I'm
in my garage and I'm

493
00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:09.480
getting things done and taking
care of business. It is

494
00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:12.340
somehow more satisfying than a
big mahogany home Home office.

495
00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:16.430
And you know, if I
may say something that reminded

496
00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:18.710
me of, you've probably seen
some research that says, if

497
00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:22.310
you're in a cafe with
cafe background noise, you're actually

498
00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:25.550
more creative than if it
had been silent. Likewise, if

499
00:27:25.550 --> 00:27:27.620
you take a shower you're
more creative than if you

500
00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:29.660
take a walk you're more
creative and all these things

501
00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:33.050
have been pretty well demonstrated.
Now, a walk and a

502
00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:36.770
shower and a cafe have
nothing in common except a

503
00:27:36.770 --> 00:27:42.590
certain type of distraction that
you can compartmentalize. Like you

504
00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:45.230
can walk while forgetting, you're
walking your shower wall, forgetting

505
00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:48.590
your showering cafe. You, you
block out the background noises

506
00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:52.610
after wall. So there's something
about a creative distraction that

507
00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:58.220
somehow helps the, the generation
of new ideas. Interesting. So,

508
00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:00.470
so I think you're going
to find your treadmill desk

509
00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:04.010
is giving you more than
exercise. I like that. I'm

510
00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:07.580
wonder if it's blocking out
all of the crushing self

511
00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:12.740
doubt. No, you, you need
that. No lose that. That's

512
00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:14.900
the only thing that gets
us up. Have you ever

513
00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:18.440
found yourself in your office?
Not in a cafe, not

514
00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:22.100
walking, not in the shower
saying I have to get

515
00:28:22.390 --> 00:28:24.890
a strip out today and
if I don't, I'm going

516
00:28:24.890 --> 00:28:29.030
to die and I have
nothing. Yeah. So, yes. And

517
00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:31.550
when I started this, I
was doing my day job

518
00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:34.040
where I'd have to leave
from the office at like

519
00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:37.430
six 30 in the morning.
So from four to four

520
00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:40.760
30 in the morning, until
then I had to do

521
00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:42.410
my work and I had
to do one every day

522
00:28:42.410 --> 00:28:44.300
or else there would be
a blank spot in the

523
00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:47.570
newspaper. So what I discovered
was this was the great

524
00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:51.560
freeing discovery of my life
and probably the most, probably

525
00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:54.440
the single most useful thing
that I ever learned, which

526
00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:57.020
is that sometimes I'd have
this great idea and I'd

527
00:28:57.020 --> 00:28:58.790
have the whole hour and
a half to develop it.

528
00:28:59.330 --> 00:29:01.940
And sometimes I'd have only
10 minutes left and nothing,

529
00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:05.180
but I'd say, okay, just
do something bad. Just do

530
00:29:05.570 --> 00:29:07.880
you know, you don't have
the option of nothing. So

531
00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:09.650
if all you can think
of is the bad idea,

532
00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:13.040
do that bad idea what
happened was, and the great

533
00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:18.200
realization is that the readers
would judge the bad version

534
00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:21.800
as highly as the good
version sometimes better. In fact,

535
00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:25.070
there was no correlation between
what I thought was a

536
00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:27.500
home run and what the
audience loved was a good

537
00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:31.040
comic that I just couldn't
judge. And I'd seen a

538
00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:34.040
hint of that when I
first tried to submit my

539
00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:37.430
comics for a publication, when
I tried to become a

540
00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:41.560
syndicated cartoonist, I put together
50 sample Dilbert comics. I

541
00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:44.710
called all my friends over
and I said individually, so

542
00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:47.530
they wouldn't be influenced by
each other, sort, these into

543
00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:49.510
the good ones and the
bad ones. So I only

544
00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:53.050
send out my good ones.
And number of friends did

545
00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:55.780
that and there was no
correlation. It was, there was

546
00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:58.180
no way I could pick
the better ones that were

547
00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:00.850
more likely to be picked,
just no correlation. So I

548
00:30:00.850 --> 00:30:04.270
sat them all in and
don't get picked up. But

549
00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:07.870
one thing you learn is
that you're just not good

550
00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:10.870
at judging what other people
are gonna like. You, you

551
00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:14.410
have to kind of put
something out there, conform to

552
00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:16.480
some rules of, you know,
it has to be this

553
00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:20.230
type of thing for the
space beyond that. You're just

554
00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:23.950
guessing. Very cool. Well, folks
can check out the first
