all weekly discussion with web

9
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.450
developer and technologist Scott Hanselman.
This is Lawrence Ryan announcing show

10
00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.650
number four 39. In this
episode, Scott talks with Tom

11
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.090
Sodestrom from JPL about space
and the next it decade.

12
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.670
Hi, this is Scott Hanselman.
This is another episode of

13
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.160
Hansel minutes, and I have
the pleasure of chatting with

14
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.580
Tom Soderstrom. He is the
chief technology innovation officer at

15
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.250
JPL or division of NASA.
How are you, sir? Very

16
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.900
well. Thank you, Scott. What
is it like having a

17
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.990
nasa.gov email address? Is that
just the best? It is

18
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.420
fun. I mean, it's, it's
an amazing institution to be

19
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.640
part of. And of course
I'm with the jet propulsion

20
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.120
laboratory, which is associated with
NASA. So how does that

21
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.000
work? It's associated with NASA.
It's not a division, but

22
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.070
you guys are so, so
friends, you're a subdomain of

23
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.620
NASA. I know that much.
Yes. So we are a

24
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.820
federally funded research center. So
it's a Caltech contract to

25
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.850
NASA that runs JPL. We're
also a NASA center. We

26
00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.710
have 30 spacecraft and instruments
operating across the universe, at

27
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.670
least our solar system. And
we are, we also do

28
00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.960
some non-governmental work. So we
get around. Is it hard

29
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.870
to tell where NASA ends
and JPL begins? Now? We're

30
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.780
very, very good part where
NASA center. I see. So

31
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.820
the NASA work is for
NASA and it's extremely exciting.

32
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.480
Yeah, it is amazing. You,
you, you've got some amazing

33
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.930
stuff to talk about and
the way that NASA, as

34
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.720
a, as a consumer of
NASA products, I like to

35
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.870
think about that as myself
has changed, it feels like

36
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.610
over the last five to
six years, I'm seeing open

37
00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.150
shores coming out of NASA.
We're seeing more images, more

38
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.090
data you're, we're drowning in
NASA data. When it seems

39
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.370
a little bit more secretive,
10, 15 years ago, I

40
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.680
think that's a really good
common Scott. And I'm glad

41
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.470
that you're seeing that this
openness and participation is a

42
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.230
really big deal for us.
So JPL, we're doing our

43
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.320
part and of course, NASA
is doing their part, but

44
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.240
it's all about getting citizens,
the value for their buck.

45
00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.470
And it's about extending humanity
and discovering where life came

46
00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.870
from and all of those,
it sounds like platitudes, but

47
00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.640
it's much more than that.
It's, it's an Amazing place

48
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.520
to work and I'm happy
to go over some details

49
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.150
as we move on. Yeah.
Please like when you're in

50
00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.270
a meeting with bosses and
you're your boss yourself, are

51
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.360
you saying in those closed
door meetings, how can we

52
00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.100
get this information to the
people in a way that

53
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.690
is digestible? Or how can
we put this on the

54
00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.080
website? Yes, we do that.
And we also think, how

55
00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.990
can we, of course do
things better. What people may

56
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.630
not realize is we use
the same tools that all

57
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.990
you do, programmers. We use
iPhones, we use Androids, we

58
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:32.970
use Microsoft, all the mobile
devices and we use servers.

59
00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.550
So it's the same technology
that we use on the

60
00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.800
ground. Then the space, it's
a little different. We have

61
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.100
different challenges of radiation and
things like that. Jim renaly

62
00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.130
my boss at JPL is
a CIO. We often talked

63
00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.830
about if we had no
legacy, what would we do

64
00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.550
differently? So think like a
startup. And so we've started

65
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.950
to do that. And so
it's reaching people, but it's

66
00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.670
also, how do we do
our business better? And how

67
00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.430
do we attract the next
generation of explorers to come

68
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.100
and work at JPL and
NASA? That's so interesting. Like

69
00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.860
I can intellectualize that. You're
saying that you use the

70
00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.590
same tools that we're using,
but it seems like it's

71
00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.410
such a venerable institution and
that the people that JPL

72
00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.920
would be just using some
magic parallel technology that is

73
00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.370
that we, that we, that
the small people don't have

74
00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.150
access to, But you don't
know, not at all. And

75
00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.350
I think the magic of
JPL and NASA is very

76
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.630
passionate, smart people. Sometimes we
use tools that are old.

77
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.170
It's a, it's an enterprise
and it's hard to bring

78
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.920
in new tools in the
enterprise. For instance, what we

79
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:44.220
have is we're using things
like the approach of it.

80
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.200
I think that's important. And
I'll talk about the technology.

81
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.490
The approach of it is
not information technology. That's all

82
00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.020
yesterday. It's about innovating together,
still it, but it's a

83
00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.310
very different, it it's one
where you become prosumers producers

84
00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.920
and consumers of it. So
we have so many end

85
00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.850
users that are very smart
in it. They're double D

86
00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.340
or triple D. They're very
good at what they do.

87
00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.100
They're good at it. And
now with the whole cloud

88
00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.380
and software as a service,
we also have to be

89
00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.860
pseudo lawyers to understand the
license agreement and make sure

90
00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.240
we don't get ourselves anybody
in trouble, but that innovating

91
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.710
together drives everything. So it's
that openness, both inside our

92
00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.000
institution and also with the
public. This is my personal

93
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.640
opinion, but crowdsourcing is a
very, very big future for

94
00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.970
us. You know, I've been
in the industry 20 plus

95
00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.190
years. And the first half
of that, I had a

96
00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.280
feeling of them versus us
in the sense of I

97
00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.680
didn't work in it. I
was a consumer of it,

98
00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.590
but they were very secretive
and very controlling and they

99
00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.600
manage their servers. And, you
know, we were the dumb

100
00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.260
users and they were it
as things innovate in the

101
00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.690
future. I really like that
innovating together because it is

102
00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:58.010
like a partnership. Whether it
be your partnership legal, you

103
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.260
can have an attitude that
they're there to say, no.

104
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.850
Or you can have an
attitude that they're there to

105
00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:04.730
help you say, yes, what's
the path to, yes. It

106
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:06.620
seems like you feel that
it is working in that

107
00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.100
way. Very much so. And
I think the, as we

108
00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:10.960
look at the next it
decade, I'll give you a

109
00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.220
couple of examples. So we
publish something that we call

110
00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:19.240
the next 80 decade and
it's the next three years.

111
00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.850
Cause there's a generation gap
between the freshmen and a

112
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.060
senior in college and it's
speeding up. So the next

113
00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.310
it deck, the last it
decade for us the last

114
00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:30.850
three years for seven trends,
seven is too much. It's

115
00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:34.330
too complicated. So now it's
one trend, it's social, mobile

116
00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:38.440
analytics cloud, and something we
call key disruptors. So smack.

117
00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.850
And that part of that,
the enabler of all of

118
00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:47.620
that is to see cloud
cloud computing made it possible

119
00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:50.290
to do innovations much faster.
So we've been doing cloud

120
00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:53.020
computing for about six years
now and we wanted to

121
00:06:53.080 --> 00:07:00.040
get in the consumerism the
scale. And so Microsoft, Amazon

122
00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.860
Google that type of scale
that they only worked with

123
00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:05.470
the consumers. So we went
to our legal team and

124
00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:10.120
said, how can we bring
these contracts in not to

125
00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.510
negotiate every single end user
license agreement, but to bring

126
00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:15.580
it in. So we can
have one contract that anybody

127
00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:20.520
at JPL can use for
each of these vendors and

128
00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:26.620
legals and it, and especially
procurement partnered up and draw

129
00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:30.160
this innovation, whereas before it
was much more difficult to

130
00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:34.210
do, and that can fast
forward where we're innovating together

131
00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:37.750
all the time. Now. So
legal and procurement is kind

132
00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:41.830
of an innovation enabler. And
when I talk across industry,

133
00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:46.330
other industries, haven't quite gotten
there yet, but they're there

134
00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:48.490
on their way. I don't
suppose that one can just

135
00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:52.360
take the JPL visa card
and the JPL Hotmail account

136
00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:57.490
and log into something like
Azure. Yes, you can essentially,

137
00:07:57.490 --> 00:07:59.890
you can't say what the
good news about this. You

138
00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:01.960
can't take your own credit
card or your own government

139
00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:05.560
credit card and don't cause
it enabled by it, which

140
00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:09.430
means that it's blessed by
it, which means you won't

141
00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:13.210
get yourself in trouble or
the institution in trouble because

142
00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:16.210
we only blessed the ones
that are safe, et cetera.

143
00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:18.880
Cloud computing is a big
deal. I could talk about

144
00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.400
that for hours and we
don't have hours, but the

145
00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:25.480
key to us is we
use multiple clouds and we

146
00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:28.300
use, we put the data
and the story, the storage

147
00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:31.210
and the computing in the
appropriate place. I say, if

148
00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:33.700
you're paying in the past,
we only had one place.

149
00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:38.710
So if you put all
of your computation and storage

150
00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:41.980
in the super secret safe,
then you're paying too much.

151
00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:44.740
If it's just the cafeteria
menu. And if you put

152
00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:48.040
everything where it's not specialty
secure, then you're not securing

153
00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:50.860
your uplink commands and things
like that. So being able

154
00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:54.790
to realize that there are
multiple appropriate places and they

155
00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:58.760
have a model it's been
a real enabler. That's an

156
00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:02.540
interesting philosophy. I realized that
every vendor wants one to

157
00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:06.320
buy into their one vendor
world. And a Microsoft person

158
00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.420
wants you to have an
Xbox and a windows phone

159
00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:11.270
and a PC, but I
have a PlayStation and an

160
00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:13.970
iPhone and a windows PC.
And cause that's my hybrid

161
00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:16.970
life. Each one has a
different role in my life.

162
00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:20.030
And then from an it
person's perspective, each cloud has

163
00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:22.760
good things and bad things
about it. Yeah. If I

164
00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:28.130
may give you two examples,
please. When Azure first came

165
00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:33.030
out, we used, we partnered
up with somebody named Michelle

166
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:36.440
VRD at JPL, and she
had the vision of being

167
00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:40.400
able to have games where
people could be citizen scientists.

168
00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:44.900
So we created a website
called BIA Marshall and B

169
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:47.210
Marsh and was hosted in
Asher, was at Monash. It

170
00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:50.570
was brand new and it
was very successful. So as

171
00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:53.630
Asher is more people log
on, it could automatically scale

172
00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:57.620
out without us having to
have computers inside. And that

173
00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:01.130
lived on and we'll set
up. People could participate, identify

174
00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:03.800
features on Mars that we
could then feed to the

175
00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:08.210
scientists that could say 50,000
people think it's probably a

176
00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:11.180
crime That we were exploring
tiles of pictures that you

177
00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:13.280
had created. It was you,
you were fooling us into

178
00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:16.580
doing crowdsourcing work, right? Oh,
you got it. So it's

179
00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:19.220
very good for the taxpayer's
money. Cause it's a, it's

180
00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:23.330
it engage the citizens. It
collects data, et cetera, with

181
00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:27.320
Amazon. We've also done a
lot. Let me give you

182
00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:31.490
one example, which was two
years ago, wonderful time, very

183
00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:35.600
scary time. It was on
the web at seven minutes

184
00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:38.090
of terror. It was actually
like for me, two years

185
00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:42.430
of terror and we wanted
to share the public, shared

186
00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:45.140
the pictures coming down from
ours. Maybe explain to a

187
00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:46.670
moment for people who are
listening, who don't know what

188
00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:50.060
the seven minutes of terrible,
Ah, it's a wonderful movie

189
00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:54.230
created by the outreach side
at JPL. And you can

190
00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:56.750
being able to Google it
and look for seven minutes

191
00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:59.720
of terror. It's about a
five minute video that explains

192
00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:06.050
in detail. What happens when
curiosity enters the atmosphere of

193
00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:09.470
Mars and lands. It goes
from thousands of kilometers per

194
00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:12.260
second to stand still in
seven minutes. And a lot

195
00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.600
of innovations were made that
have never been done before.

196
00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:18.260
So our piece in it
was how do we tell

197
00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:22.430
the story? This is JPL
and NASA Superbowl. It's our

198
00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:30.140
Olympics. It's our one chance
we used cloud computing. So

199
00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:33.080
as the pictures came down
from Mars, we were able

200
00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:34.790
to use saw them at
the same time as we

201
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:38.540
did Really. You didn't time
delay them. No. And at

202
00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:40.940
the time, can you imagine
how many people we stream

203
00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:44.390
150 terabytes in just a
few hours. We don't have

204
00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:46.670
that type of capacity in
the side. That would be

205
00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:49.100
too much, most of the
time and not enough that

206
00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:53.060
day. So we were able
to do content distribution using

207
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:58.330
web services. So it's scaled
up automatically and we helped

208
00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:01.660
along monitored it. And then
when it was done, it

209
00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:05.110
scaled down. And so we
only paid for what we

210
00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:09.390
used and it was a
really good experience. It's kind

211
00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:11.850
of a classic cloud computing
scenario where we need it

212
00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:13.860
for a while as a
burst and then we won't

213
00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:17.250
need it. So why spend
the time building up right

214
00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:19.590
where ourselves? And we noticed
that it was 10 times

215
00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:22.230
the volume afterwards as it
had been before. So people

216
00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:24.690
were interested. Of course, we
want to tell the story.

217
00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:28.710
An interesting event happened six
months later, which was the

218
00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:33.120
asteroid was coming close to
earth. And some clever person

219
00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:35.880
wrote a game that you
could ride along the asteroid.

220
00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:39.480
As it approached earth, it
went viral. People love that

221
00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:42.810
logged on. And we didn't
know. All of a sudden

222
00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:46.230
guy JPL is watching the
website start spiking, flipped it

223
00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:50.400
over to the cloud infrastructure
name as an infrastructure. And

224
00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:52.830
it handled it without a
blip. So nobody had a

225
00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:57.360
blip and we just left
it there after that. So

226
00:12:57.390 --> 00:13:01.880
external websites facing external, just
kind of make sense. Yeah.

227
00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:06.120
Any other cloud stories and,
but it's the cost effectiveness

228
00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:08.940
of it. It's the speed
to market. It's the return

229
00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:12.270
on attention for us of
doing new experiments where a

230
00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:15.870
customer user of it gets
interested. We prototype with them

231
00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:18.990
very rapidly. Try it. If
it works, it can go

232
00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:23.910
into be productized. And that
speed is really new for

233
00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:26.790
us and exciting That term
that you just kind of,

234
00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:28.440
it was a throwaway term,
but I want to dig

235
00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:31.770
into that. You said return
on attention, right? Return on

236
00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:34.200
attention. It's a term we
made up. That's a great

237
00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:38.880
term. It's if you're doing
a prototype and if you're

238
00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:41.280
doing something like cloud computing,
which was a prototype to

239
00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:44.640
start, you will never get
return on investment. It's the

240
00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:46.770
wrong thing to look for
because you won't get the

241
00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:50.910
investment. Instead, if you get
the attention from an end

242
00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:54.360
user, who's interested and you
do this rapid prototype experiment

243
00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:57.840
on a real business problem,
and you do it together.

244
00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:03.840
If you get two of
those ROA plus ROI equals

245
00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:06.270
ROI, because then you will
get the investment. Then you

246
00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:09.450
can measure it. Speed to
market is much more important

247
00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:13.920
initially than a return on
investment. So that's just a

248
00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:17.880
effectively, a formalization of Fail
fast. Yeah. Yeah. It is.

249
00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:21.120
And fail. Failure is hard
in our world, but failing

250
00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:23.820
in it is a, it's
a big deal. We had,

251
00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:26.790
I had this epiphany, it
took three years. So I'm

252
00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:30.750
not so bright. I was
getting frustrated because people were

253
00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:34.620
saying, no, I can't do
that pilot. So why can't

254
00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:38.190
you do the pilot? But
in their minds, pilot meant

255
00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:41.520
if it works, it's going
to go into production. It's

256
00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:43.710
a big deal in my
mind. It meant if it

257
00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:47.790
works that we learned something.
So the right word is

258
00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:51.650
prototype. Once we changed the
vocabulary and said, let's do

259
00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:54.440
a prototype and we'll learn
something, it was much lighter

260
00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:58.520
and easier and you don't
need to overly process prototype.

261
00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:00.790
Right, Right, right. It says,
the deal for us prototypes

262
00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:05.320
are effectively meant to fail.
Yeah. And pilots though, if

263
00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:08.290
they fail it on, man,
that pilot, I poured my

264
00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:10.300
heart into that thing. That's
right. It's not, it's a

265
00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:13.540
different amount. So we kind
of, we have a process

266
00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:19.690
ideation, prototype pilot production, and
between pro prototype and pilot

267
00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:25.060
is a huge difference in
documentation and time and therefore

268
00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:27.850
money. It's so funny that
all these years later, the

269
00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:31.000
most important thing in computer
science is naming things correctly

270
00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:33.460
because it just affects how
the users look at it.

271
00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:35.830
It affects how the engineers
treat. It affects how management

272
00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:38.710
deals with There's another term,
if I may throw out,

273
00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:40.930
which is kind of fun
and it's eye catching, because

274
00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:44.530
I agree with you. It's,
it's the moniker. It's we

275
00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:48.460
have something we call the
it petting zoo. So what's

276
00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:50.710
a petting zoo. It's where
you get to pet the

277
00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:53.530
animals in it. Petting zoo
is where you get to

278
00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:56.770
try the new technology, the
emerging technology that's coming in

279
00:15:56.770 --> 00:16:00.100
that next it decade. And
we borrowed it to, I

280
00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:02.740
heard a tune term from
Booz Allen Hamilton a long

281
00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:05.290
time ago and we liked
it. So it stuck. And

282
00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:09.400
a lot of the new
things in it first entered

283
00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:13.420
through the it petting zoo.
And it's about the use

284
00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:17.260
case. It's about somebody taking
this emerging technology, trying it.

285
00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:20.860
And if it works in
our world, then we adopted.

286
00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:23.470
If it doesn't, we write
down why it doesn't. So

287
00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:25.690
when other people try it,
we can understand it. It

288
00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:27.970
makes a lot of economical
sense and it's exciting. And

289
00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:30.640
it's fun. And I have
many examples of things that

290
00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:33.010
went through the pudding zoo
that we're not using. Then

291
00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:35.350
they're fun. Those are, that's
a, that's a great term.

292
00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:36.400
I'm going to have to
try to get that to

293
00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:38.710
catch on at work. We
have a thing that's called

294
00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:42.010
the garage that people use
to, if something came out

295
00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:45.130
of the garage, if it
succeeds, that's great. We can

296
00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:46.780
say, look, it's amazing. It
came out of the garage.

297
00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:48.340
But if it, if it
was failed, you say, well,

298
00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:50.470
it's just a little garage
project. It's just something fun

299
00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:52.560
to try out. And it's
a kind of an ITP.

300
00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:56.350
Yeah, yeah, no, actually your,
your arch is quite impressive.

301
00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:02.680
And we're, we're about to
create makers, spec makerspaces, and

302
00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:06.760
we're doing hackathons. We'll be
doing maker fairs. We do

303
00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:09.790
a lot of open software.
We're now getting into understanding,

304
00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:12.370
open hardware and playing with
it and trying it. And

305
00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:16.420
that enters through the pairings.
Every time I mentioned Makerfair

306
00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:18.880
to someone and they don't
know what it is, I

307
00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.590
just kind of die a
little bit inside, but then

308
00:17:20.590 --> 00:17:22.210
I get really excited because
I want to explain to

309
00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:23.980
them how important it is
to go to a maker,

310
00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:26.560
fair, to take their kids
to a maker. Fair. Are

311
00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:28.600
you all looking to get
more involved in maker? Fair?

312
00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:31.750
Oh, very much so. So
we do a hackathons, right?

313
00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:34.780
Hackathons is software. So forgive
me. I'm going to get

314
00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:37.270
my little definition. That needs
to be completely incorrect. No,

315
00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:43.420
it's okay. But hacker fares,
hacker hackathons versus Makerfair versus

316
00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:48.070
Mayfair hackathons. So for software,
there's this new movement that

317
00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:50.880
software program or the future
is very different than the

318
00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:53.550
program of the past. It's
about making the data available

319
00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:57.450
and stringing it together very
quickly. And now we're experimenting

320
00:17:57.450 --> 00:18:01.020
with wearable computing and wearable
computing has the ability to

321
00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:03.570
change. Our labs has the
ability to change our conference

322
00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:07.410
rooms and the fact that
you can be hands free

323
00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:11.660
and command it with gestures
or voice Enables all kinds

324
00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:13.970
of things. So all of
a sudden you're getting hardware

325
00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:17.960
devices and with open hardware,
like we know raspberry PI,

326
00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:21.350
you can afford it. So
now if you can take

327
00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:23.780
the passion of software and
the passion of this new

328
00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:27.470
hardware and put it together,
we can start creating things

329
00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:30.980
that we couldn't afford to
do before. It's almost a,

330
00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:33.110
it's a rapid, it doesn't
have to live forever or

331
00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:37.040
had a huge investment. You
can just prototype, try it

332
00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:40.490
fail quickly. And what I've
found is that when we

333
00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:43.100
give these types of solutions
to the end user at

334
00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:46.760
JPL, they innovate and create
things that we could never

335
00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:49.700
dream of in it. Yeah.
It's, it's, it's funny that

336
00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:51.260
you mentioned that this, this
is a bit of a

337
00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:53.690
non-space related thing, but it
might be interesting to you

338
00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:57.680
thinking about wearables and open
technology. I wear an insulin

339
00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:00.650
pump and I have a
sensor that shows my blood

340
00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:03.260
sugar. And this is a
sensor that's made by a

341
00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:06.020
company that does not give
us their data has a

342
00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:10.070
proprietary connector and proprietary this
and that. And the I've

343
00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:14.330
been in the industry thinking
about managing blood sugar systems

344
00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:19.490
for 20 plus years. We
not myself, but a group

345
00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:22.610
created a hashtag and a
project called we are not

346
00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:25.550
waiting. We diabetics. So I'm
not going to wait for

347
00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:27.800
the FDA. I'm not gonna
wait for this company to

348
00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:30.200
give me their data. So
we got the data out

349
00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:32.750
of this device. We plugged
it into raspberry PIs and

350
00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:35.840
Arduinos and Androids. We send
our blood sugar data up

351
00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:39.260
into the cloud. Imagine how
long it would take for

352
00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:42.500
us. If we had a
child with diabetes to wait

353
00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:45.290
for this product to be
cloud enabled where I could

354
00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:48.470
see my child's blood sugar
at school, I'm not going

355
00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:50.240
to wait 10, 15 years
for that. The child will

356
00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:52.760
be out of school. That's
right. So they did it

357
00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:56.150
themselves. And they, they take
this device, this small, it

358
00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:58.760
looks like an iPod nano.
They plug it into an

359
00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:00.980
Android phone. They put it
in the child's backpack and

360
00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:03.290
then dad or mom can
watch the child's blood sugar

361
00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:07.190
and have a sense of,
of wellbeing. It's a, it

362
00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:10.450
gives me goosebumps. It's fantastic.
It's amazing. It's yeah. And

363
00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:13.520
it's plugging these, these Lego
pieces together in ways that

364
00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:17.180
one I shouldn't have to
wait. I hope that the

365
00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:20.180
companies of all kinds allow
us to do things like

366
00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:23.300
yes, you're doing some cool
stuff with pebble. Yeah. Yes.

367
00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:28.220
So wearable computing. Remember Jim
Rinaldi is the CEO of

368
00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:32.660
JPL. And I saw the
iPhone coming and we get

369
00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:37.070
really excited about the potential
for applications on the phone.

370
00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:39.830
This was before they really
were open and all that.

371
00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:44.240
And it happened now with
a wearable computing like pebble.

372
00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:48.280
What we did is we
crowd some of that. When

373
00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:52.720
I, for hackathon and wrote
some applications, fun applications. Like

374
00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:54.700
you can see the latest
pictures from Mars on your

375
00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:58.810
pebble. They come down because
curiosity landed on Mars. We

376
00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:01.060
wanted you to see the
pictures. So we put the

377
00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:03.820
pictures in the cloud. Now
the pictures were in the

378
00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:06.640
cloud. We can now just
pull them down for any

379
00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:09.610
device. So you can see
the latest pixel from Mars

380
00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:13.510
on any mobile device, on
the pebble, in Google glass,

381
00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:18.040
et cetera. Another one we
did was opals. Opals is

382
00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:22.540
a project that is trying
to do optical communication to

383
00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:26.230
space the differences. Right now,
we get all of our

384
00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:29.260
data through a straw. The
straw is called radio frequency.

385
00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:32.980
If you could do optical
calm, all of a sudden

386
00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:35.350
you get a fire hose.
So you could do so

387
00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:38.770
much more. So this was
an experiment put essentially a

388
00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:43.270
laptop on the space station,
the space station streamed, a

389
00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:46.810
high definition video down to
a receiving station on earth,

390
00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:50.280
but do it through optical
con Like fiber optics without

391
00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:52.440
the fiber fiber optic without
the fiber. So it's just

392
00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:55.620
a laser mirror to mirror
like straight shot. Yep. But

393
00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:58.080
the speed at which the
earth turns and the orbit,

394
00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:00.180
I mean, if even a
geosynchronous orbit, there's going to

395
00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:02.340
be jitter, how do you
see? You have to tune

396
00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:07.020
it and you can do
fairly short, but still long

397
00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:09.960
enough bursts. And the data
is so much faster. Really.

398
00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:11.850
So height is, I was
always wondering, like, it's great

399
00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:14.790
that we're landing on Mars,
but where's my 10 ADP

400
00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:19.060
or four KB. Imagine high
definition video from Mars Four.

401
00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:23.460
Okay. That's fantastic. It's coming.
And that was very successful.

402
00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:29.160
And so the optical comm
was a fabulous thing and

403
00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:31.950
they wanted to control synchronized
their watches. This was a

404
00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:35.040
very young team, was part
of the early career hire

405
00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:39.720
program that JPL does. Our
leader. Charles Elachi is an

406
00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:44.040
amazing man. He had this
vision of getting excited, young

407
00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:46.500
people in and they put
them a lot of them

408
00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:50.280
to do this Opus project
across NASA. And so they

409
00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:52.440
wanted to synchronize the watches
cause they had a hard

410
00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:55.860
time finding app when the
laser firings were coming. So

411
00:22:55.860 --> 00:23:00.420
we created what we call
an innovation vacation and innovation

412
00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:05.100
vacation is a prototype where
somebody could do something they're

413
00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:07.470
passionate about for a short
amount of time. Cause we

414
00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:09.780
don't have that much money.
Like Google's 20% time that

415
00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:12.270
they talk about it. That
was the purpose. Could we

416
00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:14.790
do Google's 20% time now
we can't afford it. What

417
00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:17.430
else could we do? Let's
do an innovation vacation. That's

418
00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:20.790
cool. A guy named Rob
Witt off at JPL. And

419
00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:24.150
I came up with that
term. So we found this

420
00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:26.460
person who was passionate, wanting
to do something on pebble.

421
00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:29.160
It's great. We have this
problem. We want to try

422
00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:31.830
to figure it out. So
he did it person named

423
00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:36.330
Dan Islam. And from, he
got a one week vacation

424
00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:39.360
from his day job. His
management said, okay. And then

425
00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:42.390
in one week he created
this app, but he created

426
00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:45.530
it from first monocle. The
pebble pretty created on the

427
00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:50.900
iPhone, the Android, the website
all in one week by

428
00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:55.910
just being 100% focused. And
so we find it in

429
00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:57.830
for a week to do
this probably work day and

430
00:23:57.830 --> 00:24:00.550
night. Yeah. Well it's a
personal sprint. Why not run

431
00:24:00.550 --> 00:24:03.370
as fast as you can
Learning this new technology. Everybody

432
00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:06.340
loved it. And it was
very successful because all of

433
00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:09.340
a sudden the people who
were doing this for mobile,

434
00:24:09.550 --> 00:24:13.510
that they weren't tied to
the screen anymore. And there

435
00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:15.370
was a very interested, we're
going to do more innovation

436
00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:18.310
vacations. We're doing a lot
more with a pebble. The

437
00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:23.050
fact that you can control
devices being hands free. And

438
00:24:23.050 --> 00:24:25.930
now we're also doing a
lot with Google glass, which

439
00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:30.190
makes you hands-free completely. So
it's the use case in

440
00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:33.160
our clean rooms. For instance,
it's important to be able

441
00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:35.890
to be hands free. And
especially if you have gloves

442
00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:38.330
on, Are you doing anything
with connect or with the,

443
00:24:38.410 --> 00:24:43.450
Oh yeah. So a natural
user interface new week and

444
00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:47.260
ops lab at JPL is
doing a lot with it.

445
00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:49.150
So we're partnering, we kind
of use the pairings of

446
00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:51.850
approach and they take it
farther. Like I said, if

447
00:24:51.850 --> 00:24:54.100
you give something in the
hands of an end user

448
00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:59.050
at JPL, you'll get amazing
results. So JPL and Microsoft

449
00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:03.760
had a partner early on
with Microsoft connect. And today

450
00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:08.860
we're doing things like being
able to zoom model in

451
00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:13.690
3d by using your Chester's,
just put a Microsoft connect

452
00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:18.190
on there. We're controlling robot
arms remotely by tracking your

453
00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:21.220
hand movements. And if you
can do that, maybe you

454
00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:24.940
could do it on the
moon or in Mars. So

455
00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:27.160
this is a pretty big
deal across NASA. Now the

456
00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:33.370
whole wearable computing gestures and
it's the ground. The bottom

457
00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:36.310
line is we're using gaming
technology, right? That you can

458
00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:39.670
buy in the store. So
the consumer electronics is changing

459
00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:42.520
so quickly that all we
really need to do is

460
00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:44.950
stay in the forefront and
try to figure out what's

461
00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:48.400
coming. And if it has
any application to us, how

462
00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:50.650
do you know if it
has application, you put in

463
00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:53.350
the petting zoo, you let
people try it out or

464
00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:56.590
passionate end users and they'll
figure out if this application,

465
00:25:57.310 --> 00:26:01.360
but another buzzword, if you
will, is today's toy is

466
00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:05.220
tomorrow's tool. Yeah. And that's
it. It's very true is

467
00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:09.160
sometimes a CTO. I call
myself chief toy officer. The,

468
00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:11.800
I know that you're into
interested in Google glass, but

469
00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:15.730
I think that the Oculus
rift with 10 ADP or

470
00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:20.260
4k that close to your
eyes combined with some interesting

471
00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:22.930
Kickstarters, like there was one
that was called an Omni.

472
00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:24.910
I'm going to get the
name wrong, but I'll put

473
00:26:24.910 --> 00:26:26.260
it in the show notes.
It was like an Omni

474
00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:29.770
box. And basically imagine the,
the kinds of disks that

475
00:26:29.770 --> 00:26:32.380
kids use to slide down
a slope on a sled.

476
00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:35.080
It's a round disc. That's
concave. You put it under

477
00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:38.500
your feet and you have
a, a belt on and

478
00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:42.220
you can actually walk pushing
on this disc with an

479
00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:44.910
Oculus rift plus a connect
to know where your hands

480
00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:48.360
are. That means I'm walking
on Mars, from my perspective,

481
00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:51.320
It's fabulous. One of, so
we're looking at all the

482
00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:53.870
use cases so we can
already, and it should be

483
00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:56.210
live in Google glass. Now
you can walk on, you

484
00:26:56.210 --> 00:26:58.520
can be on Mars and
turn around and you'll see

485
00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:00.680
it in three D when
you do the same thing

486
00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:05.450
in Oculus rift, you are
completely immersed. And a person

487
00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:08.570
Jeff Norris team at JPL did
a lot of development with

488
00:27:08.570 --> 00:27:12.830
document Oculus riff so that
you are completely immersed. And

489
00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:16.550
that's now you can do
tell operations tie that the

490
00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:19.070
movement. And we also use
the leap to follow your

491
00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:22.520
hand movements more closely. So
you tie all of those

492
00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:27.110
things together and you now
have an amazing experience where

493
00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:31.070
you're on Mars and you're
picking up a rock and

494
00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:34.070
it's translating to movements where
the robot is actually picking

495
00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:38.360
up a rock. So as
a consumer of the information

496
00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:41.360
that's being provided to me
via JPL and NASA, I

497
00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:45.320
can do this Oculus rift,
Google glass things today, but

498
00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:48.620
put me in the mission
control person or the scientist

499
00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:53.540
who is, are there scientists
working in, in this industry

500
00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:55.190
who are going to put
an Oculus rift on and

501
00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:56.960
look around and like do
that? Are they sitting in

502
00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:59.570
front of a computer with
a mouse exploring? Like, I

503
00:27:59.570 --> 00:28:03.170
think that rock is important.
It's something we're studying carefully.

504
00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:07.430
Now. How can you drive
time on Mars? It's expensive.

505
00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:10.490
It's not like there's a
rush hour, but you only

506
00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:13.760
have so much time. So
could we be more precise?

507
00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:17.570
So there's a lot of
research trying to figure out

508
00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:21.470
how can we make more
accurate decisions? All of the

509
00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:24.170
Rover can drive itself and
it's automated. We try to

510
00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:28.100
plan the drive. So there's
a lot of happiness. Your

511
00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:31.760
question is very well put.
So stay tuned. I think

512
00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:35.030
they will invent something Just
I'm interested in. If perhaps

513
00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:39.710
the consumer myself has more
fun toys than the scientists

514
00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:42.800
trying to solve these problems.
It's certainly been true in

515
00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:45.500
the past. And we want
to bring those toys into

516
00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:48.980
the scientists. They can use
them. Three D printing is

517
00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:52.160
a good example. A three
D printing is really coming

518
00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:55.610
of age in that it
petting, I'm sorry. In the

519
00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:59.510
three, the it decade, the
three years, six years ago,

520
00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:03.440
I stupidly predicted that three
D printing was a big

521
00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:07.070
deal. Nobody cared really. I
thought it would come down

522
00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:09.830
from a hundred thousand dollars
to $10,000. That's such a

523
00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:12.740
price drop that it will
surely take off it. Didn't

524
00:29:13.550 --> 00:29:16.160
now we predicted again and
now three D printing is

525
00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:19.130
really taking off. Yeah, because
he went from roughly 10,000

526
00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:22.880
to $1,000. We could now
buy several three D printers

527
00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:26.150
put in the petting zoo
and people experiment. We found

528
00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:29.660
that it reduced the cycle
time from months to hours

529
00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:34.310
where the scientists and engineers
can print out. They can

530
00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:38.540
design models, print them, try
them, even if it's in

531
00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:43.600
plastic, learn, print more learn.
And eventually, which is much,

532
00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:46.300
much faster than before we
can then three D printed

533
00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:49.120
on an expensive three D
printer that either we or

534
00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:52.510
somebody else have, or we
can manufacture it the traditional

535
00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:57.190
way. And it's remarkable. Three
D printing is, we're now

536
00:29:57.210 --> 00:30:01.680
experimenting with, could we three
D print on Mars? Right?

537
00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:04.620
So send something over there
that was raw, the raw

538
00:30:04.650 --> 00:30:07.740
equipment and say, we need
a little bit different part

539
00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:10.290
for this. Or the robot
is too small. Let's make

540
00:30:10.290 --> 00:30:13.470
it an arm attachment or
exactly whatever, like an anteater's

541
00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:16.380
nose to go into a
particular Location, or imagine that

542
00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:18.750
you could send the three
D printer. And of course

543
00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:20.610
there's radiation on Mars. So
you need to build a

544
00:30:20.610 --> 00:30:24.480
hut. Three D printer could
take the regolith of Mars,

545
00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:28.380
essentially the soil and make
bricks and stack up bricks.

546
00:30:28.410 --> 00:30:31.350
We couldn't afford to transport
all those bricks up there.

547
00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:34.140
You know, it's funny. I
just watched this really horrible,

548
00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:38.610
horrible movie called transcendence with
Johnny Depp. And it was

549
00:30:38.610 --> 00:30:41.040
just awful, you know, I
mean becomes omnipotent and everything.

550
00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:43.410
But what was interesting about
it that they, he had

551
00:30:43.410 --> 00:30:48.450
developed nanotechnology and started taking
the dirt itself to create

552
00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:52.710
solar panels to power himself.
And, but the idea was

553
00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:56.970
that the there's all this
Silicon in the it's, you

554
00:30:56.970 --> 00:30:59.310
know, there's, there's this equipment
like there's this raw material

555
00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:03.090
let's just shorten the distance
between, I need solar panels

556
00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:06.540
and there's some dirt here.
Any basically would, you know,

557
00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:09.840
it would look like dust
and then the nano mites

558
00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:12.840
would turn into something. That's
what you basically just described.

559
00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:16.290
You've got all this desk
dust. That's, that's a small

560
00:31:16.290 --> 00:31:21.660
little robot. There's certainly enough
dust on Mars. The, the

561
00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:25.620
other thing about the three
D printing is materials. I

562
00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:28.200
think that's where the next
revolution will come. You can

563
00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:31.560
now, so let's say you
need to make plastic and

564
00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:34.980
metal. That's going to be
very weak. Indeed. What if

565
00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:38.700
you could print something that
is gradually, it's a plastic

566
00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:41.820
and turns into metal. Oh,
because at the, at the,

567
00:31:41.910 --> 00:31:45.330
not the molecular level, but
at the micro micron level,

568
00:31:45.330 --> 00:31:48.690
it is intermingled. Yes. Cause
you can three D print

569
00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:52.260
metal. You can three D
print kinds of a plastic,

570
00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:55.350
one or two at the
same time. It, it it's,

571
00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:58.110
it makes my head hurt.
When I think about all

572
00:31:58.110 --> 00:32:04.110
the possibilities, for example, the
solid structure is expensive, but

573
00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:05.640
if you three D print
it, you can print it

574
00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:09.030
as a lattice work works.
And that's just as strong.

575
00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:11.130
A honeycomb is as strong
as a solid, but it

576
00:32:11.130 --> 00:32:13.740
doesn't weigh nearly as much,
right. A fraction of the

577
00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:18.480
amount. There's a little startup
out of LA called AI

578
00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:23.190
robotics. That's working on an
all in one, three D

579
00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:31.140
printer copier, a scanner and
fax machine. So imagine if

580
00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:33.750
you could fax a spare
part up to the space

581
00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:39.350
shuttle or to Antarctica, right.
And for the price of

582
00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:42.560
this machine is probably about,
I'm guessing $2,500 or something

583
00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:45.320
like that. Right. But it's,
it's really, it's an amazing

584
00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:49.280
future. And so far we're
really talking plastics, but once

585
00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:53.720
you start talking different materials,
could we print the spare

586
00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:57.500
wheel on a Rover on
Mars? That's fantastic. It's really,

587
00:32:57.500 --> 00:33:00.460
it's, it's quite fun. Well,
thank you so much for

588
00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:02.860
chatting with me today, sir.
Can I get one last

589
00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:07.270
plug? No, please do The
open data, open data. And

590
00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:10.300
so big data is a
big deal. So the next

591
00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:13.960
it decade is social mobile
analytics cloud, and key disruptors.

592
00:33:14.890 --> 00:33:19.420
The analytics is the actionable
part. Big data. Big data

593
00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:24.820
is over-hyped. Analytics is not.
So analytics means we'll need

594
00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:28.630
data scientists who can tell
a story. So the educational

595
00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:34.000
system should prepare them for
being tinkerers that can visualize

596
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.080
data quickly and tell a
story. And our mantra right

597
00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:40.540
now is to when we
do new missions. And we're

598
00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:44.740
thinking about it is to
think data first, think about

599
00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:47.230
how the data will be
reused. So we have the

600
00:33:47.230 --> 00:33:49.720
cloud so we can store
data and we can access

601
00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:51.880
it. And we can do
lots of computing on it,

602
00:33:52.390 --> 00:33:54.580
but we have to think
about how we would reuse

603
00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:58.540
it. And now everything is
data. We worked with Microsoft,

604
00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:02.320
for example, to be able
to take the videos we

605
00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:05.200
produce in JPL tube. It's
like a YouTube, but it's

606
00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:09.310
inside our firewalls and be
able to automatically transcribe them,

607
00:34:10.630 --> 00:34:15.940
use something called Mavis, Microsoft
audio, visual information, indexing service.

608
00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:19.450
And it's fabulous because now
you can search all thousands

609
00:34:19.450 --> 00:34:21.850
of videos in a fraction
of a second. And it

610
00:34:21.850 --> 00:34:25.510
comes back with the words
that people spoke. You don't

611
00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:29.170
need the metadata because it's
created automatically. And so now

612
00:34:29.170 --> 00:34:31.990
you can reuse lessons, learn.
You can do all that.

613
00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:35.440
And then we realized once
we have that, the videos

614
00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:38.500
are not data. You can
do analysis on them. You

615
00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:41.950
can search for the words
that are our engineering videos,

616
00:34:41.950 --> 00:34:45.430
different than safety videos, et
cetera, et cetera. So everything

617
00:34:45.430 --> 00:34:50.320
has become data. It's an
amazingly world. So thinking data

618
00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:53.350
first will hopefully drive us
to even more exciting missions.

619
00:34:54.010 --> 00:34:57.340
Some of the, of the
visualization technology that's been available,

620
00:34:57.340 --> 00:35:00.460
like with <inaudible> J S
yes, we use a lot

621
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:04.690
it's it's mindblowing. And I
still struggle to create D

622
00:35:04.690 --> 00:35:08.530
three JS, you know, quality
visualizations that are as good

623
00:35:08.530 --> 00:35:10.870
as those that Mike Bostic
and the people who know

624
00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:13.180
how to use D three
JS, but it feels like

625
00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:16.990
Edward Tufte, he's kind of,
you know, his, his, his

626
00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:19.900
predictions are coming true now.
Yeah, he sure was ahead

627
00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:22.600
of his time. He's a
hero. And I tie that

628
00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:25.300
to three D printing. Imagine
that we could three D

629
00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:29.650
print the orbits, it took
to get to Mars, tying

630
00:35:29.650 --> 00:35:32.920
the data to now being
able to visualize it and

631
00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:36.010
share it, hand it around,
You know, how in all

632
00:35:36.010 --> 00:35:39.570
of the movies that are
about space, there's some big

633
00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:43.350
round disc that all of
the important captains get around.

634
00:35:43.350 --> 00:35:46.770
And then they have like
a hologram topography of whatever

635
00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:49.980
mission we're trying to do.
Every great scifi show has

636
00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:53.700
that visualization, visualizing disk. And
I don't know if there's

637
00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:57.150
enough if of holograms will
ever truly happen, but I

638
00:35:57.150 --> 00:36:00.060
saw something recently. I think
it was MIT's media lab,

639
00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:04.560
but you know, those grids
of nails that kids can

640
00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:07.050
buy where you put your
hand underneath the nails and

641
00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:09.120
then the nails pop up
and you basically see a

642
00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:13.680
nail projection of your hand.
The, the MIT media people

643
00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:16.860
basically had a table full
of those nails, and they

644
00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:21.120
could not three D print,
but instantly visualize a topography

645
00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:25.020
or something that was happening.
It would be amazing if

646
00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:28.280
you had that optical connection
to Mars and the moon

647
00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:31.830
Rover is moving. We would
actually see the topography of

648
00:36:31.830 --> 00:36:35.220
what was happening in real
time. Physically, not a three

649
00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:37.620
D representation as we would
see it on a screen,

650
00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:41.940
but that, that topography at
a table level. I agree.

651
00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:46.650
And it's about that emotional
connection with the data, the

652
00:36:46.650 --> 00:36:50.730
visceral sense of the data.
Yes. And because for us,

653
00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:53.340
the three D printing the
visualization, all that means the

654
00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:56.550
scientists and engineers have a
much better discussion and with

655
00:36:56.550 --> 00:37:00.900
it, so we can take
fewer missteps. So it's about

656
00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:03.000
being able to visualize where
we want to go, but

657
00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.450
then also be able to
take the prototype steps rapidly,

658
00:37:06.450 --> 00:37:09.360
rapidly to get there. It's
never been a better time

659
00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:13.530
to be in it. It's
every, day's a new adventure.

660
00:37:14.370 --> 00:37:16.380
Well, this has been an
absolute joy, and I'm afraid

661
00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:18.060
I could talk to you
for hours, but our time

662
00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:19.740
is up. Maybe you'll come
on the show again. Some

663
00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:21.150
time I would love to
thank you very much, Scott.

664
00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:24.270
Thank you so much, Tom
Soderstrom from JPL. And this

665
00:37:24.270 --> 00:37:27.630
has been another episode of
Hansel minutes. We'll see you

666
00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:35.280
again next week. <inaudible>.
