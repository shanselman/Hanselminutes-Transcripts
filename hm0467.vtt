22
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.840
hanselminutes.com. It's Hansel minutes, a
weekly discussion with web developer

23
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.580
and technologist Scott Hanselman. This
is Lawrence Ryan announcing show number

24
00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.260
four 71. In this episode,
Scott talks with dr. Danielle Smith

25
00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:01.220
about usability and the human
factor. Hi, this is Scott

26
00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.620
Hanselman. This is another episode
of Hansel minutes. And today

27
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.030
I am talking with dr.
Danielle Smith from Sentier strategic resources.

28
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.120
She has a PhD in
psychology with a focus on

29
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.700
human factors. You are in
a UX Expert. Yes, I

30
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.700
am. Scott. Thank you. I
really appreciate talking to you.

31
00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.160
And I'm going to put
in the show notes more

32
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.490
information about, about Sentier and
about the things that you've

33
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.280
written up, but you've been
exploring this space for a

34
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.460
great deal of time, trying
to make the experience better

35
00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.440
for the, for the user,
right? You work for the

36
00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:39.800
user you're like Tron. Yeah,
I do. The thing about

37
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.500
UX is it's such a
broad field that I sorta,

38
00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.210
I feel like I always
have to have this disclaimer,

39
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.870
is that I really focus
on the psychology of things.

40
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.460
So I do a lot
of research. I do a

41
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.150
little bit of design, but
nothing I've ever designed has

42
00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.300
just gone out into the
public. There's another there's other

43
00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.250
parts of UX that make
things more polished and more

44
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.170
attractive, Right? There's a difference
between someone that is, you

45
00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.880
know, dragging the button and
saying the bevels should be

46
00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.920
like this and the color
theme should be like that.

47
00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.060
But you're saying that what
you focus on is this

48
00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.400
user experience is quantifiably more
effective than user experience be?

49
00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.750
Yes, most of the time,
the thing about it is,

50
00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.010
you know, it's a little
bit of art, a little

51
00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.920
bit of science, and sometimes
we can quantify it. And

52
00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.190
sometimes we can't, but we
use the idea of these,

53
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.860
this, the way that humans
operate. So like you said,

54
00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.920
I have a degree in
psychology. So humans think this

55
00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.130
way, they perceive things this
way. So we use that

56
00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.730
to say that in times
that we can't quantify things

57
00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.190
to say that this one
is likely to be better.

58
00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.660
So How often in computer
interactions in UX interactions does

59
00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.320
culture matter? Like does a
Canadian interact with a website

60
00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.980
different than, than a Mexican
or a European? Not very

61
00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.700
often, surprisingly enough. Like a
lot of times we go

62
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.530
into things thinking that culture
matters a lot, but it's

63
00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.980
hard to predict honestly. So
we ended up testing a

64
00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.980
lot of times testing things
anyway, or releasing them out

65
00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.010
into the wild and monitoring
them to see if culture

66
00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.710
matters. But a lot of
times it doesn't. And then

67
00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:19.440
when it does matter, it
matters in weird ways. What's

68
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.780
a, what's a weird way
that culture would matter. My

69
00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.780
favorite example is trying to
deliver a survey. Like you

70
00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.430
try to, you design your
survey instrument, you test it

71
00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.830
to make sure all the
words are right. You translated

72
00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.850
into let's say Chinese and
then launch it. And you're

73
00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.240
like, Oh, everybody in China
is really happy about this

74
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.940
product. So much more than
everybody in the United States, when

75
00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.120
really it's just, people use
scales differently. Culture dictates the

76
00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.800
way people use scales. Interesting.
I can imagine Americans being

77
00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.650
like one that sucks, but
that should just, you know,

78
00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:53.940
the Chinese might be like,
I really don't want to

79
00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:59.580
hurt those people's feelings. So
I'll say seven. My favorite

80
00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.980
thing to do is to
test things in Germany because

81
00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:06.630
you kind of get the
no, In my, in my

82
00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:11.520
mind I was like nine,
so that's good, right? No,

83
00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.270
that is not good. We
suck in Germany. Okay. So

84
00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.920
if, if culture doesn't matter
now that was geographic culture.

85
00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.950
But what about like, you
know, products for salespeople and

86
00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:27.570
business people versus for nontechnical
parent? You know, that psychology

87
00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:32.760
is significant. Yes, it is
very much so. So that's

88
00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.460
actually one of the fields
that I specialize in and

89
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:40.920
sort of decision making under,
under uncertainty. And when people

90
00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.920
are less technically savvy, you,
they make more guesses. Even

91
00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.900
though they may not know
they're making guesses. So you

92
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.860
want to have really strong,
clear affordances, so like clear

93
00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.440
direction as to what they
should do versus lots of

94
00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.580
options. But when you're designing
for a business setting where

95
00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.840
people, certain expectations about tasks
that they want to be

96
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.050
able to do, you try
to design more flexibility, but

97
00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.410
still people are people you
give them too many options,

98
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.280
they'll make guesses. And so
you have to balance that

99
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:14.260
very carefully. That, that phrase,
I really liked that decision

100
00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:18.600
making under uncertainty. I feel
like I come in into

101
00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:23.410
situation with my nontechnical parents
where they're like, you know,

102
00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.770
I did something to the
computer. Like they, they reflexively

103
00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:29.740
feel that whatever went wrong
with that survey or that

104
00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:35.080
website or this check deposit
was my fault. Yes. And

105
00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.420
I, as a usability, as
a person who does a

106
00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:41.410
lot of usability testing, I
find myself reassuring people. Don't

107
00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:46.360
worry. It's not your fault.
It's the computer's fault, but

108
00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.810
people do. They internalize it.
They want, believe it or

109
00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:52.420
not, most people want, most
people want the thing that

110
00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:55.180
they bought to work. And
so they tend to get

111
00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.940
mad at themselves because they
don't want to think they

112
00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:01.510
are wrong and think expecting
the single word. Yeah. I

113
00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:04.270
had a lot of really
uncomfortable conversations about windows eight

114
00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:09.580
and the, the issue was,
is it not usable or

115
00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:13.420
is it unfamiliar? Because fast
forward two years from now,

116
00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:16.360
you know, two years into
the present right now, most

117
00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.950
people that I talked to
that have used windows eight

118
00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:20.800
for years are quite comfortable
with it. So then it

119
00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.570
was the fact that it
was unfamiliar that made us

120
00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:24.880
assume it was unintuitive. And
that got me to thinking

121
00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.520
like, is the only reason
that the start menu makes

122
00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:31.000
sense is because it's been
around for 25 years. Yeah.

123
00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:34.330
That's the hard thing. Like
every time that something, a

124
00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:37.030
new paradigm comes in, comes
up, you have to think

125
00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:40.270
about it that way. Like,
is it really something about

126
00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:43.300
the interface that makes it
not fit for human consumption

127
00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:49.510
or is it just the
newness of it? So once

128
00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.580
I did a lot of
work for keyboard with keyboards.

129
00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:55.300
So whenever you change a
keyboard, especially with a business

130
00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:59.530
and a business setting with
touch typist, people are angry,

131
00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:03.520
like key cap height. How,
why they are like, no

132
00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:05.500
matter how much analysis we
do to show that it's

133
00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:09.670
re result in less stress,
or it's more, you don't

134
00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:12.880
have any more or less
errors using the new keyboard.

135
00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:15.580
People are angry. So you
kind of have to wait

136
00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:19.690
and see if they adapt
to the, the new idea.

137
00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:24.520
I think that users get
deeply attached to their computers.

138
00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:28.210
You know, like when you
move someone's cheese, they will

139
00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:32.530
freak out because this is
where they live. Right. And

140
00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:34.330
they don't really care about
you. They don't care about

141
00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:36.760
your computer. They, they live
here. They are just trying

142
00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:40.510
to live. And if some
new, some new design comes

143
00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:43.900
along, that is ultimately better
for one reason or another.

144
00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:48.190
If the user doesn't perceive
that right away there, they

145
00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:52.030
have no motivation. I noticed
that on, on the iPad,

146
00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:57.330
on iPads and in the
world of people now, as

147
00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:00.090
we're several years into that
world are convinced the tablets

148
00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:03.540
are completely intuitive, but it
seems to me that we

149
00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:06.930
spend a lot of time
with applications that would dim

150
00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:09.990
out the entire screen and
have a shadow hand saying

151
00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:13.590
touch there. If, if tablets
were that intuitive, I don't

152
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:16.350
think that every iPad app
wouldn't have a first run

153
00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:23.300
experience. It was like, touch
here. Exactly. Like I had

154
00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:26.930
that experience, like I gave
my grandmother a tablet a

155
00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:30.140
couple of months ago and
I tried to get her

156
00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:31.940
to call me on Skype.
And I was like, just

157
00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:34.730
press the camera icon. And
she's like, what? Camera icon?

158
00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:37.370
There is no camera icon.
Oh, you mean this rectangle

159
00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:40.640
with a triangle next to
it. Oh, okay. It's like,

160
00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:45.650
Oh right. Yeah. Even now
today, like Android phones, I

161
00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:47.480
still haven't figured out what
the three icons at the

162
00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.280
bottom are. Like, one of
them's kind of shaped like

163
00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:52.160
a monopoly house. So I
think it means home, but

164
00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:54.320
the other ones I have
and the hamburger, what is

165
00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:58.100
the hamburger? You, what I'm
talking about? The three lines,

166
00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:01.340
like that's now become a
thing I know. And no

167
00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:05.780
matter how many studies that
wonderful UX people do and

168
00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:09.410
publish that, say that performance
is so much better. If

169
00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:13.160
you have the word that
says menu versus a hamburger,

170
00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:16.460
we're continuing to push that.
And it remains to be

171
00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:19.190
seen as if like in
five years, my grandma will

172
00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:20.690
be like, Oh yeah, I
just hit the hamburger. And

173
00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:23.420
it works. I don't think
grandma knows it's called a

174
00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:26.480
hamburger. And one of my
most popular blog posts is

175
00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.420
the one that an entire
generation of people are pushing

176
00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:31.910
on the save icon without
even having ever seen a

177
00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:38.210
floppy disk. Oh yeah. So
you say that studies have

178
00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:40.280
come out that say that
the hamburger does not perform

179
00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.590
as well as a simple
button marked menu. Then where

180
00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:46.250
is the disconnect between you
who have the knowledge and

181
00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:48.590
the data and the scholarly
research to prove that this

182
00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:51.620
is a bad idea. And
as you mentioned earlier, kind

183
00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:54.500
of downstream some designer overrode
you and said, no, no

184
00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:59.990
hamburgers are prettier. Well kind
of the same reason that

185
00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:03.770
blue Ray exists, you know,
there is a larger business

186
00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:06.440
vision that human factors, people
and UX people do have

187
00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:10.760
to fit into. And if,
as an industry like, Oh,

188
00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:13.940
hamburgers are prettier, but they
also save us space. And

189
00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:17.570
they response when you go
responsive, it works a lot

190
00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:21.740
better than we do make
some tradeoffs. And as long

191
00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:23.810
as people don't fail, you
know, can't complete the main

192
00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:27.050
task of, you know, checking
out or saving their document

193
00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:29.930
or whatever it is, then
we will go ahead and

194
00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:32.810
make other allowances. I think
one of the other challenges

195
00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:35.990
about UX is that once
you've poisoned the user, by

196
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:39.590
teaching them that those three
lines are the menu, well,

197
00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:41.630
then now they're poisoned. And
then they're no longer a

198
00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:44.450
fresh person that you can
introduce this concept to. Now

199
00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:46.610
I can't get any valid
data out of this person.

200
00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:49.220
They know that already. Yeah.
The hard thing is that

201
00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:51.260
a lot of, it's hard
to know when they know.

202
00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:55.180
So just because someone's used
something, they may not even

203
00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:59.770
remember that that's the way
it happened. Because like I

204
00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:01.540
said, they don't really care
about your thing. They care

205
00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:04.930
about the thing they're trying
to do. So you'll see

206
00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:07.510
a lot of research where
you'll have someone do a

207
00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:11.380
task. So I'll have someone
go check out with their

208
00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:14.470
phone, at a coffee shop
and with some new app

209
00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:17.350
that I've downloaded to their
device. And at the end

210
00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:19.240
of the session, or at
the end of the task,

211
00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:21.520
they will tell me, so
how did it, how did

212
00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:24.340
I go? And they will
describe something completely different than

213
00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:26.680
what happened, because they don't
really care. They just want

214
00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:28.210
it, the coffee that I
was giving them for free

215
00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:31.840
for using the app. So
I will observe and watch

216
00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:34.180
the way they handle things
and note what needs to

217
00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:36.910
change. But when we have
them recall, they don't necessarily

218
00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:40.620
remember the experience. That is
interesting. So that's why you

219
00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:43.410
record these things from multiple
angles and the screen and

220
00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:46.800
all that information. Right. I
think that also, once people

221
00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:48.630
have done something a few
times, there's a, there's a

222
00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:52.110
kinesthetic aspect of things where
the physicality of it, like,

223
00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.480
I don't even know how
to make a new mail

224
00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:58.620
in Gmail anymore. I just
go all tab and then

225
00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:00.570
see, and then start typing,
you know, like I don't

226
00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:03.930
even see the compose button
anymore. I get tunnel vision.

227
00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:08.490
Exactly. Like the classic example
of that is that, do

228
00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:12.180
you know how to drive?
Can you describe the small

229
00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:16.440
micro movements you make when
you drive? Oh, wow. Okay.

230
00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:18.390
And I bet that if
you ask someone to give

231
00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:20.250
you a recipe, they would
miss a step is what

232
00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:22.170
you're saying. Yeah. They would
miss a step. They would

233
00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:24.510
not think about, you know,
how they let their foot

234
00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:26.730
off the gas or how
they move their hands. When

235
00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:29.610
they turn the wheel, they
wouldn't necessarily remember all of

236
00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:32.070
that. That's interesting. You know,
I just realized as I'm

237
00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:34.410
running through the steps in
my head, I didn't even

238
00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:36.270
think about, you have to
push the brake before you

239
00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:39.420
turn the car on. Yes.
I actually had to drive

240
00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:42.240
to pick up a friend.
I had to drive like

241
00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:44.220
two miles. They called me
the car. Won't start the

242
00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:46.560
car. Won't start. This is
a person who'd been driving

243
00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:49.530
for 20 years. For whatever
reason on that random Tuesday

244
00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:52.980
morning, they forgot that they
had to push the brake

245
00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:55.350
to start the car. So
they were sitting there with

246
00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:57.450
two feet on the ground
trying to start this car

247
00:13:57.450 --> 00:13:59.280
and they couldn't figure it
out. And I said, well,

248
00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:02.490
here put your foot here.
Oh, like you've been driving

249
00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:06.210
for 20 years. What is
wrong with you? Okay. Or

250
00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:08.700
like people, people have never
filled up their gas tank.

251
00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:11.640
It's amazing to watch them
at gas stations. Hey, now

252
00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:15.240
I live in Oregon and
it is illegal to pump

253
00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:18.210
your own gas here. You
don't even know this. No,

254
00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:21.660
I did not. Oregon has
no sales tax and it

255
00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:24.360
has a no where you
physically not allowed it is

256
00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:27.510
illegal to fill your tank.
So when I very first,

257
00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.450
you know, my first drive
up to Washington, I just

258
00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:33.780
sat there for like 20
minutes and then wasn't going

259
00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:36.930
to come and help me
out. And even now true

260
00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:40.290
story, I am still not
a hundred percent sure if

261
00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:44.880
I'm doing it right. Yes.
Yeah. It's amazing that things

262
00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:46.530
that you kind of take
for granted, and that's one

263
00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:50.310
of the reasons why I'm
kind of my profession exists,

264
00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:57.410
right? Because developers, designers, hardware
manufacturers, they do their thing

265
00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:00.110
really well. Right? You are
responsible to make sure that

266
00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:04.040
my computer does not blow
up and it works, but

267
00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:06.440
you sort of take it.
You forget about the bits

268
00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:10.180
of the experience that you,
you take for granted. Well,

269
00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:12.430
I think that also people
think that UX is at

270
00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:16.000
the beginning of a very
long waterfall. When I think

271
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.830
it's more of a cycle.
And I think that we

272
00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:21.640
as software developers, I know
myself rarely at the end

273
00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:24.460
of the waterfall, when the
product has shipped, feed that

274
00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:27.400
data back to you. Like
that's what you need. There's

275
00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:30.010
a cycle of improvement here.
And for so many large

276
00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:32.980
systems, there's massive amounts of
data that are simply not

277
00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:35.320
being collected that you probably
could be using to make

278
00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:39.490
the experience better. Oh, definitely.
That's so one of the

279
00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:42.670
things about human factors, as
opposed to some other sort

280
00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:47.980
of more targeted experience or
fields, is that we tend

281
00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:52.240
to look at the broader
system and at different places

282
00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:53.940
I work, they really do
look at me like, Oh,

283
00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:55.750
okay, you're there for the
beginning. You know, when it's

284
00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:58.270
on paper or when it's
just the UI and it's

285
00:15:58.270 --> 00:16:01.720
not hooked up to the
bag, but you get the

286
00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:04.480
most amount or you get
a lot of information at

287
00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:06.190
that point, but you get
a lot of good information

288
00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:09.490
when it's out in the
field. So like, how do

289
00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:12.100
things fail? Where do the,
where does the funnel kind

290
00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:16.540
of break down? And then
what sort of calls are

291
00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:20.050
you getting? Like customer service
is sort of the richest

292
00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:26.620
untapped bit of UX refinement,
potential that's out there because

293
00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:29.080
that's when you find out,
you know, what kinds of

294
00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:31.900
people have problems because maybe
we didn't think that they

295
00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:33.850
were part of our target
target audience. So we didn't

296
00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:37.450
even test with them in
the beginning. You find out

297
00:16:37.450 --> 00:16:39.910
what they're trying to do.
Cause again, we, we start

298
00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:42.820
off with sort of a
core set of assumed tasks

299
00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:46.000
and folks might be trying
to do something completely different

300
00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:50.350
or in an environment that
we didn't think about. And

301
00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:54.730
so we have this opportunity
to actually grow, to grow

302
00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:57.550
the experience as well as
refine that, if that makes

303
00:16:57.550 --> 00:17:00.460
sense. Do you, do you
think that that large companies

304
00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:02.950
are dropping the ball, that
they are missing this opportunity

305
00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:06.250
to grow the experience? Yeah,
I do. I feel like

306
00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:08.590
they're doing, there's a lot
of good initiatives out there

307
00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:11.380
that are trying to close
this loop. There's lots of

308
00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:15.130
companies that have like customer
experience programs, but they don't

309
00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:19.150
necessarily talk to the UX
team. That is a different

310
00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:22.870
organization. It's run sometimes out
of quality sometimes out of

311
00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:27.040
customer service, but that loop
back is something that's missing.

312
00:17:27.610 --> 00:17:30.310
So like when you deal
with a large corporation, you're

313
00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:34.360
most of the time painfully
aware of that, they'll try

314
00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:37.720
it. You'll buy some new
product, have a bat, have

315
00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:40.810
a problem call in and
they know nothing about you.

316
00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:44.620
Even though like some of
these companies should know a

317
00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:49.140
lot about you. So your
cable provider, for example, you're

318
00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:51.840
having a problem you call
in and they have to

319
00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:56.100
ask you what's, what's the,
what's the name on the

320
00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:57.930
front of your cable box?
It's like, wait a minute.

321
00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:59.790
Then you ship this to
me. Why do you not

322
00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:03.480
know what this is? So
I feel like large companies

323
00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:05.160
have a lot of resources
and a lot of data

324
00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:06.990
that they can be using
to kind of close that

325
00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:12.470
loop and make things continuously
better. I want to take

326
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:15.920
a moment to thank our
sponsors, sync, fusion, sync fusions,

327
00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:19.640

328
00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:23.570

335
00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.040
It seems like, is the
problem organizational willpower? I mean,

336
00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:00.320
you just described something simple.
Like I know that it's

337
00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:03.560
always a joy when I
call customer support and they,

338
00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:06.080
they say, hello Scott, because
they saw the caller ID

339
00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:09.860
and their, their, you know,
CRM system loaded my name

340
00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:11.690
up. And they're like, Oh,
are you calling about this?

341
00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:14.540
The issue I called about
three hours ago, I'm like,

342
00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:18.260
Oh, you actually care about
me. But customers were like,

343
00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:21.320
the first five minutes of
the call is just figuring

344
00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:23.420
out who the heck I
am. It's like, y'all don't

345
00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:25.700
care. And that must mean
your CEO and leadership don't

346
00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:29.210
care. Right. And that's what
you, that's the way you

347
00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:31.250
feel. And that's the way
I feel when I call.

348
00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:34.730
But I feel like a
lot of it is sometimes

349
00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:37.700
it's organizational will. Yes. It
may be some older company

350
00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:39.920
with an older mantra of
this is the way things

351
00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:43.790
go. But a lot of
the times it's just large

352
00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:46.100
companies are like working in
a city. Like you don't

353
00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:48.140
know what you don't know.
You know, you work in

354
00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:51.830
this department and these are
your responsibilities. You don't know

355
00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:54.140
that you need to take
the initiative personally to go

356
00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:56.840
out and meet the heads
of all these other departments

357
00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:01.940
and see how, what they
do affects your work. And

358
00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:06.710
honestly, you're not necessarily rewarded
for that. Cause you have

359
00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:09.230
your own goals. Your manager
has their own goals and

360
00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:11.930
processes are put in place
to sort of stifle that.

361
00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:14.720
Exactly. I've always said that
if it's not your job,

362
00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:16.730
then it's not your job.
It's not your job. So

363
00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:18.620
if it's not anybody's job
that doesn't get done. So

364
00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:21.410
then that means that a
large company, like, you know,

365
00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:23.720
an at and T or
progressive insurance or someone big

366
00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:26.810
like that, they should have
a, a for lack of

367
00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:30.680
a better word, a UX
czar who is looking at

368
00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:33.380
that 50,000 foot view and
trying to fix the problems

369
00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:36.110
like they should practice calling
in as a customer and

370
00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:38.420
see what that experience is.
Make sure everyone reminds themselves

371
00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:41.900
what that experience is like.
Yeah. Ideally they would have

372
00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:44.690
that because seeing what that
experience is like, and then

373
00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:48.400
trying to solve that problem
internally, like the UXR both

374
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.920
has to look outside of
what the customer is like,

375
00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:54.070
what customer experience is like
as well as inside to

376
00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:56.950
see what it's like for
a designer to try to

377
00:20:56.950 --> 00:21:00.460
fix that problem. Like trying
to find that data that

378
00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:05.110
you need to see, like
who's calling the customer service.

379
00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:08.620
Like what's the problem, what's
the dropoff rate or anything

380
00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:10.900
like that. It's really hard
to do from inside of

381
00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:17.010
a company, which is not
necessarily intuitive. There's this equation

382
00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:20.940
to tell how many habitable
planets there are. Have you

383
00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:24.780
ever heard about this? This
equation? It is called the,

384
00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:26.820
what is the name of
this? I'll have to look

385
00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:28.890
this up, but basically it's
one of these equations where

386
00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:32.520
they say, we're going to
estimate how many aliens there

387
00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:35.190
are in the, in the,
in the world. And they

388
00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:36.870
go and they'll say, all
right, we'll start with the

389
00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:38.850
average number of stars and
the average. And it's, it's

390
00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:42.420
a sales pipeline. But the
thing that's so interesting about

391
00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:45.210
it is that if you
change even one variable, like

392
00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:48.930
the fraction of life supporting
planets, the number can be,

393
00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:52.350
yeah, there's one planet or
yeah, there's a billion planets.

394
00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:55.140
And the same thing happens
with regard to UX and

395
00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:58.770
a sales pipeline, like one
confusing form on how to

396
00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:00.990
put your credit card in
and you can have 50%

397
00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:04.410
dropoff and people just like
give up. Right. It is

398
00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:06.960
crazy. But yeah, I need
that. I need that formula.

399
00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:09.840
I need to start using
it. Yeah. I, I feel

400
00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:14.640
like the data did I,
do I have data about

401
00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:20.040
abandoned shopping carts? Yes. That's
probably not even collected And

402
00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:22.710
not in every case. Like
that's something I learned by

403
00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:25.110
working at different companies is
that the data is not

404
00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:27.690
even there all the time.
Like you have to make

405
00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:30.360
the conscious effort as the
product manager, as the developer

406
00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:36.570
to instrument this page, this
feature or whatever. And yeah,

407
00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:39.990
So that's called the, the
Drake equation. It turns out

408
00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:42.240
it's the, it's the way
to estimate the number of,

409
00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:45.590
of active extraterrestrial civilizations in
the Milky way galaxy. And

410
00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:49.680
that is a sales pipeline,
you know, isn't it. And

411
00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:51.690
it can change drastically with
just a little bit of

412
00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:55.200
drop-off. If somebody fails to
put in their credit card,

413
00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:57.930
then you know, your sales
go down by 10 20,

414
00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:02.480
you know, some measurable, significant
percentage. Yeah. I think I

415
00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:05.190
need to start using that
equation too. Yeah. I think

416
00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:07.140
you should develop your own.
We'll have the Smith equation

417
00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:09.570
and it will be an
explanation of, you know, UX

418
00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:12.630
errors and issues and all
those little tiny it's like

419
00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:16.500
death by a thousand cuts.
Yeah. Over time. That's the

420
00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:20.460
problem. Or you had an
experience. We were talking earlier

421
00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:22.650
before the show about something
you had trouble with at

422
00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:24.840
and T you know, an
example of a really large

423
00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:30.570
company. Yeah. Actually I have,
I have at and T

424
00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:34.740
Uverse, internet and cable about
an hour. I mean, about

425
00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:37.530
a year into this journey
with, at and T I

426
00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:40.260
started to have a beeping
noise in my garage. So

427
00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:43.020
I call them and say,
Hey, there's something with your

428
00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:47.660
name on it. That's beeping
in my garage. That's a

429
00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:52.060
reasonable question. Mean, you know,
me I've you installed all

430
00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:57.610
this stuff. So their response
is, Oh, well you you're,

431
00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:01.270
it's your battery that powers
your voiceover IP system. We

432
00:24:01.270 --> 00:24:03.520
only supply the first battery.
You have to buy the

433
00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:05.200
second one. Would you like
us to ship you one

434
00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:07.210
and charge you for it?
And I was like, and

435
00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:10.390
my response was, no, I
do not have voice over

436
00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:14.230
IP with you. And you
know, 20 minutes worth of

437
00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:16.810
getting transferred, they come back.
I was like, Oh no,

438
00:24:17.050 --> 00:24:20.680
you do not have voice
over IP. However, you must

439
00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:23.620
have had voiceover IP last
year when we installed this

440
00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:26.830
system, I was like, no,
I have never had voice

441
00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:30.580
over IP through a T
and T. So 20 more

442
00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:32.950
minutes worth of transferring. And
you know, my husband's getting

443
00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:35.440
frustrated at Saturday. I was
like, I don't know what's

444
00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:40.690
going on. And finally it
was, Oh, no, sorry. You

445
00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:43.540
have voice over IP. I
don't know how we don't

446
00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:46.060
know that you have voiceover
IP, but the only way

447
00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:48.070
we can make the beeping
stop in your garage is

448
00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:50.230
for you to pay for
a technician to come out

449
00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:53.020
and take some time. So
you never paid for a

450
00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:54.910
voice over IP. Do you
know who put that box

451
00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:57.370
in there? Yeah, it was
at and T, but like

452
00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:59.530
they tell you like, Oh,
by the way, we're throwing

453
00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:01.600
a voice over IP box
in your car. No, they

454
00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:03.130
were like, Oh, this is
part of what you verse

455
00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:06.280
is for your neighborhood. This
is all the things we

456
00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:08.200
have to do. The guy
had been in my house

457
00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:09.820
for like eight hours. I'm
sure he just wanted to

458
00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:12.910
put everything as possible. Well,
so you have basically a

459
00:25:12.910 --> 00:25:16.630
bunch of unwanted unused equipment
in anticipation perhaps of some

460
00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:18.610
day than you would, you
know, maybe use voice over

461
00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:21.490
IP maybe, But luckily I'm
married to an electrician who

462
00:25:21.490 --> 00:25:23.260
was able to make the
beeping stop and we still

463
00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:26.480
have internet. Yeah. I had
a similar issue with, with

464
00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:30.430
files where it was one
of those situations where they're

465
00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:33.130
telling me that something is
so right. This is an

466
00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:35.470
example where they're in a
CRM system and they said,

467
00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:40.540
no, but dr. Smith, this
is so it says right

468
00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:42.160
here in the CRM, like,
no, you don't understand I'm

469
00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:45.040
in the garage. Right? Like
you don't get to argue

470
00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:47.770
with me. I don't care
what your CRM says. That

471
00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:50.050
cable that you're asking me
to pull, or that object

472
00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:51.940
that you say is not
beeping, is sitting right here.

473
00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:54.670
Let me hold the phone
up to it. It's and

474
00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:57.790
it's always some failure for
some piece of data that

475
00:25:57.790 --> 00:26:00.400
is coming through that process.
And it seems to me

476
00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:04.300
like this should have been
solved with data. Something was

477
00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:07.210
disconnected between the time the
person installed it. And then

478
00:26:07.210 --> 00:26:09.040
when they put it in
their system and made it

479
00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:13.450
data And it, it happens
all the time. Right. And

480
00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:14.920
it makes you feel like
there needs to be some

481
00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:16.870
sort of what makes me
feel like there needs to

482
00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:21.910
be some sort of system
integration test, right? Where the

483
00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:25.810
human is part of the
system, there's different levels of

484
00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:29.050
involvement and you just see
how it goes. And then

485
00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:31.840
when things break down, you
identify that for fit, for,

486
00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:35.020
to be fixed and actually
fix it. That's the problem

487
00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:38.020
with like all of these
sort of failures that, that

488
00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:39.820
I think of is that
I don't feel like they're

489
00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:42.340
getting fixed, like me hanging
up on at and T

490
00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:45.480
after an hour. I don't
think that now they know

491
00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:47.070
I don't have voice over
IP and they need to

492
00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:51.230
come and do something. I
had a, another funny UX

493
00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:53.930
kind of situation. I, I
have files, right. It was

494
00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:57.530
Verizon files and it became
frontier files similar to you

495
00:26:57.530 --> 00:27:00.470
versus a package deal. And
I got rid of the

496
00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:04.040
DVR, right. The TV recorder.
So I took it to

497
00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:06.830
the video, the DV, you
know, the, the local files

498
00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:09.350
company and said, here's my
DVR. And then I realized

499
00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:11.330
that I had had actually
had two, I had one

500
00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:13.400
in a spare bedroom. So
the next day, or the

501
00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:15.860
next week I got the
second one, I went to

502
00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:20.300
the office and it was
gone. Like it was empty.

503
00:27:20.930 --> 00:27:24.260
It was just an empty,
the entire office had disappeared.

504
00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:25.850
It was almost like one
of those movies where the

505
00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:29.840
NSA had taken them all
away. So I called them

506
00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:32.090
and told them that what
had happened and they didn't

507
00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:35.390
believe me. They like, you
know, there's a disconnect again.

508
00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:38.690
And, and, and then I
started, I said, well, you

509
00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:40.490
send me a box and
then I will send you

510
00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:42.920
back this DVR. So they
sent me a box and

511
00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:45.950
I sent them back to
DVR every month for the

512
00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:50.120
next two years, I got
an empty box to send

513
00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:55.040
back the DVR because they
never got it. Right. So

514
00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:57.650
God knows where the DVR
is. So after two years

515
00:27:57.650 --> 00:28:00.620
of this and literally a
collection, a collection of cardboard,

516
00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:02.600
I called them and said,
I don't have the DVR.

517
00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:05.510
And they said, okay, that'll
be $300. Oh my goodness.

518
00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:08.750
Isn't it. In UX, it
seems like the human gets

519
00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:12.620
blamed for the problem. When
the system is so much

520
00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:14.660
larger than the human, it's
so much more likely that

521
00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:17.150
it's not my fault. Right.
It is so much. And

522
00:28:17.150 --> 00:28:19.040
how much money did they
waste on you? I mean,

523
00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:24.530
seriously. Yes. But that's sort
of the thing, like, I

524
00:28:24.530 --> 00:28:31.370
feel like, well, the experiences,
app experiences, even enterprise application

525
00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:36.440
experiences, the, the mantra of
UX has been very successful.

526
00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:40.880
So you see a lot
more slicker interactions inside of

527
00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:46.340
application sort of contained experiences.
But as an industry, we

528
00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:49.430
need to work towards getting
that, raising that up, you

529
00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:55.250
know, making it broader into
the entire experience because things

530
00:28:55.250 --> 00:28:58.400
are only getting more complex,
complex. You're getting more devices

531
00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:01.310
that are awesome on their
own, but as they fit

532
00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:05.330
into the, your larger their
life, how do they work

533
00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:08.870
together? What is that experience
like? Exactly. I think that

534
00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:13.610
things are slicker and prettier
than ever before. And we

535
00:29:13.610 --> 00:29:16.700
love to call that UX,
but I still had to

536
00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:20.990
set up my nontechnical spouse's
iPhone, which is this supposed

537
00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:22.670
to be the simplest device
on the planet. Right. But

538
00:29:22.670 --> 00:29:27.410
it involved me logging into
iCloud, like 16 times. Oh,

539
00:29:27.410 --> 00:29:33.260
don't get me started. Yeah.
So what do we tell

540
00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:35.600
our listeners then who are
maybe going to their, their,

541
00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:39.170
their, their big company job
right now? Do they, maybe

542
00:29:39.170 --> 00:29:40.730
they don't even know if
they have a UX person

543
00:29:40.730 --> 00:29:44.340
or maybe need to bring
a consultant in, Well, you

544
00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:46.770
can always reach out to
me and I will help

545
00:29:46.770 --> 00:29:49.470
you any way I can.
But the other thing is

546
00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:52.560
just to ask around, ask
if there's some companies have

547
00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:56.460
UX people, they call themselves
UX professionals. Some people, some

548
00:29:56.460 --> 00:30:02.370
companies have human factors, engineers,
or industrial engineers. And while

549
00:30:02.370 --> 00:30:05.190
their responsibilities may be slightly
different, they can at least

550
00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:09.030
point you in the right
direction. Very cool. I'm going

551
00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:12.240
to put in the show
notes, the links to send

552
00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:15.060
to your strategic resources, which
is the, the UX and

553
00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:17.280
human factors company that you
work out with a number

554
00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:20.670
of other partners. And then
also some of your Google

555
00:30:20.670 --> 00:30:22.830
scholar pages and your Twitter
as well. If you don't

556
00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:26.820
mind, I don't mind. Thank
you very much, dr. Danielle Smith.

557
00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:30.420
This has been another episode
of Hanselminutes and we'll see

558
00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:31.290
you again next week.
