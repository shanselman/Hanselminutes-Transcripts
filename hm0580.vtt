<inaudible>. Hi, this is Scott

8
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.900
Hanselman. This is another episode
of Hansel minutes. And today

9
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.900
I'm talking with Daniel Shiffman,
he's a programmer. He's the

10
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.340
project lead the processing foundation.
He's got an amazing YouTube

11
00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.480
channel doing creative coding, video
tutorials, the coding train, and

12
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.110
he's a professor at ITP.
How are you, sir? I'm

13
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.090
doing very well. Thank you
so much for having me.

14
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.430
I'm thrilled to have you
here because you are doing

15
00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.180
the most people say, Oh,
Scott, you do YouTube and

16
00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.790
you do podcast and whatnot.
And I say, look at

17
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.080
Dan Schiffman's screen on his
freaking YouTube. You're doing a

18
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.820
lot of fun stuff. And
I like it because you're

19
00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.490
always positive and you're always
trying to move kind of

20
00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.570
knowledge forward for everybody. Thank
you. Yeah. You know, it's,

21
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.840
I it's, it's some of
this is in a way

22
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.090
the YouTube channel in a
way almost happened by accident,

23
00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.480
which is that I just
was making videos for my

24
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.600
students here at this program
where I teach. And so,

25
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.490
Oh, I didn't get to
this thing in class, or

26
00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.530
I kinda messed up this
thing in class. Maybe if

27
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.900
I like put together in
a video, I can show

28
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.150
it. I could show it
afterwards and then start it.

29
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.040
And, you know, it's kind
of an amazing discovery to

30
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.870
realize if I start putting
stuff up on YouTube, then

31
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.910
other people might actually watch
it too. So now it's

32
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.550
been a little over a
year that I've had this

33
00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.950
channel. It's kind of been
amazing to discover the audience.

34
00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.130
That's kind of how like
the Khan Academy started, right?

35
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.990
It's like, yeah. You know,
we were doing Skype and

36
00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.910
I just figured I would
just record a YouTube channel

37
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.250
and then it became a
thing. Yeah know, the, the

38
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.830
one thing that I did
that was different, which I

39
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.040
don't know whether it was
out of vanity or some

40
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.100
other bizarre reason, but you
mentioned the green screen. I

41
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.740
decided that in the videos,
I want it to appear

42
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.110
in the video to speak
kind of directly to the

43
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.940
audience, as opposed to be
the disembodied voice kind of

44
00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.760
appearing over just a computer
screen. So that to me

45
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.830
has a kind of really
made it, you know, as

46
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.750
soon as I did that,
then I then suddenly I

47
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.360
discovered, Oh, I'm doing a
thing. And so now I

48
00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.340
guess I'm doing a thing,
which is my YouTube channel.

49
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.010
Well, and you've got this
wonderful opening where you, you

50
00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.650
like your appearance prints and
it's like, even a music

51
00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.500
video, you like write that
music video or how exactly

52
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.390
did you decide that? I
don't know. It's just, you're

53
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.810
unapologetically wacky and I love
it. Yeah. Well, so the,

54
00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.490
you know, I was thinking
about the channel in a

55
00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.720
way, like, as you Know,
I was inspired originally by

56
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.110
the show from my childhood
called reading rainbow, kind of

57
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.350
like bringing literacy, bringing reading
to everybody in the world,

58
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.520
the kind of classic lyrics
of I can do anything

59
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.530
if I can read a
book. And so I'm kind

60
00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.840
of thinking about learning to
program in that same way,

61
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.690
like find this sort of
like wondrous magical power of

62
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.010
being able to create or
do anything. And so when

63
00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.330
I started doing the videos,
I tried to think about

64
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.550
it is this, you know,
instead of just being a

65
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.130
tutorial, can this be something
more like a show that

66
00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.920
people would tune in once
a week and kind of

67
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.880
be inspired and watch and
learn about programming and making

68
00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.030
creative thing? What it turns
out it actually, is this

69
00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.610
me like getting stuck and
debugging all the time and

70
00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.580
making a lot of mistakes,
which in strangely enough has

71
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.500
also been something that the
feedback I get that people

72
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.990
seem to really enjoy like,
Oh, that time when you

73
00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:51.910
couldn't figure out, when you,
when you were stuck for

74
00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:53.380
15 minutes and you couldn't
figure out what's wrong in

75
00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.720
your code, and you went
through figuring out I learned

76
00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.180
the most by watching you
figure it out. And so

77
00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.730
I think people can really
relate to that. Anybody who

78
00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.420
programs can relate to that
experience, What do you think

79
00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.370
that that's so important? Because
when we were trying to

80
00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.740
decide what we would talk
about on the show, one

81
00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.630
of the things that you'd
said was that, you know,

82
00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.340
we could talk about how
I make these videos, where

83
00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.950
I mess up and then
show the world how incompetent

84
00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.100
I am. It seems like
that really does help people

85
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.610
not just learn, but also
maybe feel better that like

86
00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:24.450
their favorite professor or YouTube
person really is just trying

87
00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:25.920
to figure this out. Like
the rest of us, you

88
00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.180
know, it helps with ones
imposter syndrome. Yeah, for sure.

89
00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.960
And it's, you know, I
think also the, you know,

90
00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.900
I don't, I don't have
any scientific data to back

91
00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.320
this up, but I think
that sometimes if you're watching

92
00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.840
a step by step tutorial
that is kind of done

93
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.600
in a slick way and
everything is planned out and

94
00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.900
scripted in advance, it's a
little harder to grab your

95
00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.840
attention or for it to
maybe soak in to your

96
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.980
brain as opposed to a
process where they're, you know,

97
00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.730
the actual figuring out of
the things is happening in

98
00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:03.930
real time. So there's almost
a drama or associated with

99
00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.870
that, that I think works
in terms of the learning

100
00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.170
as well. But mostly it's
just that they're, you know,

101
00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.320
you, I think that everybody
who, you know, I get

102
00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.810
this with, this is the
classic thing that I have

103
00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.060
every year. So I have
a class that I teach

104
00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.250
here at ITP, which is
a program at Tisch school

105
00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.740
of the arts, which is
part of New York university. We

106
00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.650
have a class called introduction
to computational media. And so

107
00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.290
we have about 80 to
a hundred graduate students who

108
00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.300
are many of which are
learning to program for the

109
00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.900
very first time in somewhere
about halfway through semester one

110
00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.640
at a time, they'll all
come in to talk to

111
00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.250
me and say, I think,
I think I'm the only

112
00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.350
one. Who's not getting it.
Everybody else has all these

113
00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:43.050
amazing homework assignments, but mine
I'm really not getting it.

114
00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.030
I'm not able to figure
I'm not, I think I'm

115
00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:48.900
behind everybody, but everybody really
has this same feeling. So

116
00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.930
to be able to recognize
that and see that in

117
00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.820
the teacher, who's teaching stuff
goes through that same, getting

118
00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.870
stuck. Can't figure it out
process, I think is, Yeah.

119
00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.710
I feel also that that
as men, and then, then

120
00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:07.810
as kind of, as white
men, it's important for us

121
00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:11.110
to also realize that as
we are out there making

122
00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:13.570
mistakes in public and being
wacky about it, that some

123
00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:16.510
people feel really paranoid about
making those mistakes and maybe

124
00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:19.000
feel like they can't make
those mistakes, but it's important

125
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.820
for us to show them
that it's okay to make

126
00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:25.000
mistakes like that and maybe
make people feel like they,

127
00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:28.390
they make them feel safe
to make those mistakes and

128
00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:30.820
be okay with it. Yeah.
I mean, it's a really

129
00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:35.230
important consideration. I know that
I have the luxury in

130
00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:37.930
many situations in my life
of just kind of like

131
00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:40.240
walking in with my beard
and glasses and people kind

132
00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.210
of assuming I must know
it, but he was a

133
00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:47.620
nerdy guy. Right. But, and
there may be, there are

134
00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.720
some cases where I do,
but there are tons of

135
00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.090
cases where I don't, and
I think the, sort of

136
00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:55.510
the, the being willing to
take a risk and explore

137
00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:59.890
something and try something new
is part of life and

138
00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:03.700
part of creativity and part
of working with programming software,

139
00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:06.310
frankly, as things are so
rapidly changing. And it's not

140
00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:10.270
really about memorizing this one
thing, but just learning how

141
00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:12.850
to learn so to speak.
Yeah, exactly. It's learning how

142
00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:14.530
to learn. And one of
the things that you and

143
00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:17.230
I have in common that
I think is really exciting

144
00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:20.170
about the work that you're
doing and with coding train,

145
00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:23.230
particularly as it, you were
also involved with a theater

146
00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:26.230
company and I did theater
as well, as well as

147
00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:28.780
stand up comedy. And I
got that when I saw

148
00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:30.910
you present, I was like,
I think that we are

149
00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:34.680
similar people. Yeah. Oh, well,
I'm glad you figured that.

150
00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:38.860
I basically just like a
failed musical theater After I

151
00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:41.890
actually had failed standup comic
in my Twitter bio for

152
00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:45.070
many years. I never tried
to stand up comedy. I

153
00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:48.070
think, I think I would
do well at like the

154
00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:50.170
physical shtick, but at the
writing it's such a, you

155
00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:51.970
know, you really have to
have good written material, which

156
00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:54.150
has never been my strength.
That's one of the reasons

157
00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.260
like I don't prepare at
all for my videos. I

158
00:07:56.260 --> 00:08:00.160
just kind of fumble about,
but you know, I, I

159
00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.880
did, I, you know, I
did spend time and I

160
00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:06.820
really, I'm still a huge
musical theater fan and I'm,

161
00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:09.190
you know, always have this
fantasy of maybe I'll just

162
00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:11.710
like bring it some songs
to my YouTube channel, which

163
00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:14.950
probably will be the moment
where everybody starts unsubscribing. But

164
00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:20.920
it does that thinking about
thinking about how to treat

165
00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:24.520
teaching in a way as
a performance and about how

166
00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.470
to have fun with it
and play with it, I

167
00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:29.590
think is something that certainly
matters in that sort of

168
00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:33.730
internet, world of tutorial videos.
So when you're teaching, do

169
00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:35.980
you have as much energy?
I mean, you can't really

170
00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:39.490
make every class every day
performance you would, you would.

171
00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:43.090
I don't know how I
would get exhausted. That's a

172
00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:45.310
good question. I think you'd
have to, I'd have to

173
00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:48.220
check with the students to
ask them there have been

174
00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:50.620
some it's funny, cause I
do recall some days where

175
00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:51.640
someone would come up to
me, Hey, you were a

176
00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:54.730
little low energy. Today is
everything okay? I think I

177
00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:58.470
do a bit of a,
you know, certainly not 24

178
00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:01.050
seven, but at least when
I'm presenting or talking through

179
00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:05.150
code or a math problem
or anything related to something

180
00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:07.470
I'm excited about, I do
have a kind of tendency

181
00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:11.690
to get kind of excitable
almost to a fault in

182
00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:14.280
some sense. So I do
I think have a similar

183
00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:18.600
approach while teaching, but the
context is different. I'll be

184
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:23.430
less. I, I think I
probably do a little bit

185
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:27.960
less shtick when I'm actually
in class with a smaller

186
00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:30.660
group of students. And certainly
when students are presenting, I

187
00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:34.170
take their work very seriously
and try to really listen

188
00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:37.080
and provide thoughtful feedback as
opposed to just trying to

189
00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:40.220
like, you know, make a
weird, stupid joke. But it

190
00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:42.500
seems like when I've seen
you speak that and when

191
00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:46.880
I watch your videos that
you're almost imploring them, like,

192
00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:50.360
don't you see how cool
this is? Like, this is

193
00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:53.210
amazing. Like, you know, like
let's just pause for a

194
00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:55.160
second so that you can
all drink in how cool

195
00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.650
this is, you know, that
way they, they, everyone has

196
00:09:57.650 --> 00:10:00.740
that sense of empowerment. That
seems like something that's missing

197
00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:03.140
from a lot of, a
lot of learning material these

198
00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:06.280
days. Yeah. Well, one thing
that helps with this is,

199
00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:08.240
so I do part of
some of the videos. I

200
00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.800
do a variety of different
things, but some of them,

201
00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.560
I call them coding challenges.
Most recently I just made

202
00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:14.900
mine sweeper, which to me
seemed like really people are

203
00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:16.940
interested in that, but I
got that as a request

204
00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:20.240
quite a bit so, and
I don't prepare for it

205
00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:23.300
in advance. So, and then
I think there is a

206
00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:27.050
kind of, I often do
actually have a genuine, genuine

207
00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:30.080
excitement or thrill when I
actually get it to work

208
00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.210
because it's a little, you
know, first of all, it's

209
00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:33.650
a little scary that I
might not be able to

210
00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:36.530
figure it out and get
really stuck, but it's, there's

211
00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:39.020
a, you know, there's just
a delight in having this

212
00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:41.300
sort of strange algorithm that
you started typing and you're

213
00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:43.250
trying to debug and get
to work suddenly run and

214
00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:45.800
suddenly really works. So I
think that helps as opposed

215
00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:49.970
to this is my rehearsed
PowerPoint slide lecture, where I'm

216
00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:51.380
going to go through one
at a time and make

217
00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:54.080
sure I hit all of
these bullet points. Have you

218
00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:56.630
ever like started one and
then gave up 40 minutes?

219
00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:58.640
And he was like, yeah,
I'm not even gonna upload

220
00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:02.360
that. Let's see. Well, so
one thing is I do

221
00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.790
all of this life. So
I have a strange process,

222
00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:06.860
which I'm still not sure
is a good idea or

223
00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:10.070
not. But what I do
is I will, I will

224
00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:13.610
just press that button that
makes it run live. And

225
00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:16.430
I'll usually stay live for
somewhere between one to three

226
00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:19.370
hours doing a bunch of
different things. And some of

227
00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:22.310
that is just kind of
me middling about me, tinkering

228
00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:24.560
around the computer, trying to
download the right library files

229
00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:27.950
to get set up. But
so, and then, so once

230
00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:31.280
I'm finished with like a
session, maybe I'll do a

231
00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.530
couple of different coding challenges,
one tutorial on a certain

232
00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:37.760
topic. Those will get edited
into shorter edited videos. So

233
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.580
people can always go back
and see the longer live

234
00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:43.100
stream. If there was, I've
had live streams where I

235
00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:45.710
have a 30 to 45
minute debugging session, which I

236
00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:49.670
don't know that anybody really
wants to watch. So I

237
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:53.710
have both contexts available and
I, there have been a

238
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:56.110
couple times where I think
I've been like, let's just

239
00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:58.480
leave that in the live
stream. Let's not make an

240
00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:01.600
edited version of that. But
for the most part, you

241
00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:03.970
know, and I, I actually
just last week, I'm trying

242
00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:06.280
to teach, I'm trying to
learn about machine learning and

243
00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:10.330
neural networks. And so I
discovered like, Oh, this thing

244
00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:12.430
that I was teaching, you
kind of need a calculus

245
00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:14.770
for this. And so I
thought, Oh, well, I'll make

246
00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:17.380
a couple of videos on
some calculus topics. You know,

247
00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:22.300
I studied that stuff. And
so those I haven't released

248
00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:24.220
yet, but they felt somewhat
disastrous to me, but I

249
00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:25.690
am going to release them.
So we'll see what the

250
00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:29.160
feedback. Interesting. That's funny. I,
you know, you never know

251
00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.440
what people are going to
watch. I've had, I did

252
00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:36.300
a, a three hour debugging
Docker thing that we thought

253
00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:38.010
was going to be 30
minutes and, you know, we

254
00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:40.920
still had a hundred people
watching and it was mostly

255
00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:43.860
just me with my head
in my hands was just,

256
00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:46.140
you know, going on stack
overflow and trying to figure

257
00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:49.200
out why ports wouldn't open
and people were like, yeah,

258
00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:53.340
that was great. I was
like, really, really It's very

259
00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:56.940
dramatic strangely enough. And also
what's great is having that

260
00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:59.280
live interaction. It's a little
bit hard for me to

261
00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.770
follow the YouTube chat and
I'm trying to figure out

262
00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:07.560
different ways of having more
interactivity, but it is, I

263
00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:10.410
do get, I have a
couple of really loyal viewers

264
00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:14.220
who I consistently are always
fixing my mistakes or an

265
00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:18.540
almost like at this point,
anticipate them in advance. Yeah.

266
00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:22.080
So the, the tool of
choice amongst many, but the,

267
00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:24.810
your tool of choice has
been, been pretty clearly this

268
00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:28.470
thing called processing, which you
do tutorials and examples and

269
00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:31.620
libraries for why is processing
so important in the larger

270
00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:35.790
scope of programming as a
practice? It's, it's a great

271
00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:39.540
question and try not to
give too long of an

272
00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:42.570
answer to it, I suppose.
So processing just for people

273
00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:44.280
who might not be familiar
with it at all, it's

274
00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:47.760
actually a project that started
in 2001. And because I

275
00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:51.240
have such a presence on
YouTube and in tutorials that

276
00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:53.670
we bluff and mistake me
as a creator of processing,

277
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:56.970
but I'm not processing was
created by Casey Reese and

278
00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:59.370
Ben fry, who were students
at the MIT media lab

279
00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:03.610
under John mighta at the
time. And for them, the,

280
00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:06.750
what it really grew out
of was, Oh, we're teaching

281
00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:09.480
and making creative work in
the field of visual art

282
00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:12.390
and graphic design, possibly broader
than that. But just to

283
00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:15.030
put it in that, those
terms for a second, and

284
00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:19.170
there wasn't really a tool
that they could use easily

285
00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:22.470
for teaching and for their
own work. And so processing

286
00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:25.500
started, and there's a lineage
of projects like this that

287
00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:30.510
facilitate creativity and graphics through
code for beginners, like logo

288
00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:32.970
and designed by numbers and
other ones that I'm sure

289
00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:36.180
I'm forgetting right now historically.
But one of the things

290
00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:40.920
that, that I think made
processing so great back then

291
00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:43.260
is it was built it,
and it still is a

292
00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.900
processing itself is built on
top of the Java programming

293
00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:50.340
language, which allowed it to
be easily extendable with libraries.

294
00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:55.010
So you, this simple programming
environment that you could download,

295
00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:57.440
run type a single line
of code and having a

296
00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:00.080
circle or a rectangle or
a line on your screen

297
00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.450
in a kind of almost
like turtle graphics logo, like

298
00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:06.770
way. And yet there is
the opportunity for depth there

299
00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:10.010
and for communicating with hardware
and video cameras and doing

300
00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:13.040
data visualization with us with
this, cause you're actually writing

301
00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:15.800
Java code at the same
time. So that's kind of

302
00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:19.190
where processing came from. And
for me, the reason why

303
00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:22.410
I got involved and have
stayed with it is, is

304
00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:26.290
really just, is kind of
that story of it's it's

305
00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:30.200
know, processing at this point
is less the programming language

306
00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:33.620
and environment and more the
community and the philosophy of

307
00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:41.990
making these tools accessible, easy,
friendly, inclusive to a community,

308
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:44.690
a wider community than, than
just software engineers and computer

309
00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:47.450
scientists. And that really started
with artists and visual artists,

310
00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:51.010
but as, as has grown
so much since then, Okay,

311
00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:53.860
so processing started out as
this kind of its own

312
00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:57.520
language, its own opinionated thing
built on Java, but then

313
00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:59.770
there was processing JS and
then there's a thing called

314
00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:02.980
<inaudible> and it gets a
little confusing to know whether

315
00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:06.370
I'm using processing or not.
Yeah, it's, it's, it is

316
00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:10.570
confusing and it's particularly confusing
because so processing dot JS

317
00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:13.840
was, is a project that's
started by John <inaudible>, the

318
00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:17.020
creator of jQuery. And that's
a separate, you know, there's

319
00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:20.260
lots of projects that people
have made that are libraries

320
00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.990
and extensions or inspired by
processing. And so processing dot

321
00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:25.900
JS is not a project
that was currently that's maintained

322
00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:28.750
by that processing foundation, which
I'm kind of skipping around

323
00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:33.790
here because after, but, but
P five JS is so

324
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.010
processing dot JS is a
JavaScript library that allows that

325
00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:44.380
will automatically translate your Java
processing code into JavaScript so

326
00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:47.740
that it runs in the
browser. Whereas he, five JS

327
00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:51.520
is a new project that
has a similar API and

328
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:55.180
sort of like landscape of
features that processing does, but

329
00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:58.960
is a native JavaScript platform
where if you're learning to

330
00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:01.780
use P five JS, you're
actually writing Java script code

331
00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:05.200
yourself. And so one of
the things that happened that

332
00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.720
happened in the last few
years is, you know, we,

333
00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:09.730
those of us who are
contributing to and working on

334
00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:12.580
processing thought, we should really
do something to make sure

335
00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:15.700
this tool lives on. You
know, the world is littered

336
00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:18.610
with many open source projects
that are like exciting to

337
00:17:18.610 --> 00:17:20.770
like make and release in
a weekend, but it's really

338
00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:22.750
hard to maintain these things
and to keep the community

339
00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:27.160
alive. So we formed like
a nonprofit five, one C3

340
00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:31.420
foundation corporation to raise a
little money and kind of

341
00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:33.430
also just really make the
statement like this is something

342
00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:35.290
we really care about and
we want to always be

343
00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:38.950
free. So, and at the
same time we were doing

344
00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:42.310
that on Lauren McCarthy, who is
one of the first people.

345
00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:44.500
We, we, we, she was
maybe technically the third or

346
00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:47.290
the fourth, but one of
the first fellows, we run

347
00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:49.470
a fellowship program where we
give a stipend for somebody

348
00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:53.670
with a speculative or experimental
software code project. And her

349
00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:57.630
project was what would happen
if we reimagined processing in

350
00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:01.620
today's web, in today's cultural
landscape. So not really just

351
00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:05.310
about like, what's the new
shnazzy HTML, shiny HTML five

352
00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:08.040
ESX thing, but also just
like, how do we make

353
00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:12.900
a better, more inclusive, open
source project using tools that

354
00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:16.080
are outright now, as opposed
to processing have really started

355
00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:18.110
as a project of two
or three years, Small number

356
00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:20.660
of people. Okay. So I
could teach a class or

357
00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:23.150
learn in a class where
I'm do processing in a

358
00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:26.840
local ID, you know, an
extended with Java, but then

359
00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.970
if I wanted to move
it into the, into the

360
00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:31.850
web P five JS is
kind of the, polyfill the

361
00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:36.260
runtime that native JavaScript alternative
to processing that lets me

362
00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:38.690
have a, do the exact
same work I was doing

363
00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:41.450
locally except on the web.
And it's officially supported by

364
00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:44.900
the foundation. Correct. And there
are some key differences. For

365
00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:50.150
example, processing has a really
robust 3d renderer built on

366
00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:53.120
top of joggle, which is
Java open GL. That's been

367
00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:56.300
in development for many years
by Andres kolibri has done

368
00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:58.820
a lot of the work
with that platform and it

369
00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:02.930
supports shaders. Whereas <inaudible> being
newer. It has kind of

370
00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:06.530
a, you know, experimental web
GL render, but doesn't have

371
00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:11.150
as much 3d features, you
know, <inaudible> has a, some

372
00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:14.930
hooks into Dominic emulation of
P five Dom library that

373
00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:18.080
allows you to do a
lot of dumb stuff, but

374
00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:21.530
really big do interfaces, which
processing doesn't have as easily.

375
00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:24.830
So there are, there are
differences between the two environments,

376
00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:28.100
but the fundamental one is
desktop versus web. For sure.

377
00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:32.210
And why do you feel
that processing is so important?

378
00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:34.400
I mean, there's dethrone JS,
there's a ton of different

379
00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.740
things. It seems like <inaudible>
has become the one for

380
00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:40.970
statisticians and for the New York
times, but you're promoting processing

381
00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:45.410
for artists and animators and
architects and regular people. Yeah.

382
00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:49.610
I have no interest in
promoting processing to the exclusion

383
00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:52.790
of other things. So I
mean, he, three is like

384
00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:56.480
amazing. I would love to
use it. It's like, this

385
00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:59.240
is the choice of artists,
I guess. Yeah. Okay. So

386
00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:01.850
I think that one thing
that we really try to

387
00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:06.920
stay true to, which is
challenging is that processing and

388
00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:10.580
its related tools are a
place for the total beginner.

389
00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:14.120
And not that other things
aren't that as well, but

390
00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:17.900
it's really important that, you
know, one of the things

391
00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:19.700
that you can do with,
if in a workshop that

392
00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:22.130
you're learning to code with
processing is that, you know,

393
00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:24.290
right there in the first
20 minutes, you can download

394
00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:26.840
this thing. You can hit
the run button, you have

395
00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:28.550
a window you can type
line and you have a

396
00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:30.770
line. And what we're trying
to do, we're working on

397
00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:33.230
a new web editor for
P five JS that has

398
00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:35.600
a kind of similar quality
in the browser. So you

399
00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:38.870
don't have to know about
HTML or CSS or any,

400
00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:41.210
you can peel back the
layers later to learn all

401
00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:43.490
that stuff. But I'm thinking
about what's up, you know,

402
00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:47.410
ninth grade, Saturday afternoon after
school workshop for a couple

403
00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:49.990
hours, what can you do
in two hours that you've

404
00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:51.670
just kind of like open
up this thing and suddenly

405
00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:54.490
you're, you've got some experience
with coding, but that also

406
00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:56.800
gives you the depth that
you could get further with.

407
00:20:56.830 --> 00:21:00.580
There are pathways to moving
beyond P five or processing

408
00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:03.730
and using D three or
using C plus plus, or,

409
00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:07.660
you know, you know, Dutch
ass application. So to me

410
00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:11.050
that is, so that to
me has been the sort

411
00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:13.660
of like a really we
all that, that sort of

412
00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:18.310
core philosophy that is really
key to why Karen Love processing

413
00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:20.410
so much, but mostly it's
just kind of like, I

414
00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:22.270
just love all the people
that I've met and I've

415
00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:25.900
worked with and the enthusiasm
for the project and the

416
00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:30.630
community. So I think that's
Great. How much is processing

417
00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:34.290
a language in that it
is a new, a programming

418
00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:38.020
language in and of itself
versus a framework on, on

419
00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:40.140
with a bunch of functions
on which you sit on

420
00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:44.460
top of. That's a great
question. And there's this, this

421
00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:48.390
definitely is a confusing gray
area. I, you know, and

422
00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:50.070
you could probably get different
people to give you different

423
00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:53.340
answers. So I would, you
know, I would sort of

424
00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:56.130
fall on the side of
processing, almost not being a

425
00:21:56.130 --> 00:22:00.630
language at all. And really,
you know, I think there's

426
00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:03.840
a, it's okay to create
the illusion of that in

427
00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:06.000
a beginner course where you're
first starting to learn. And

428
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.040
maybe you think that your
learning processing and maybe think

429
00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:12.570
of it as a language,
but ultimately processing and you

430
00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:16.530
know, so first of all,
well, okay, let's think about

431
00:22:16.530 --> 00:22:19.920
processing itself, just the Java
version. It, it really, there's

432
00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:23.610
nothing about it that isn't
a hundred percent Java syntax

433
00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:26.580
and you could import any
Java library and use it

434
00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:29.130
right in the processing editor.
So in that sense, it's

435
00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:32.370
like a simplified eclipse, but
it just has all of

436
00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:38.430
these processing libraries built into
it that said we do

437
00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:40.590
there, there are some, you
know, for people who might

438
00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:43.440
be technically interested, there are
some small things that are

439
00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:46.590
done with a preprocessor that
will make us, you know,

440
00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:49.290
we have a color data
type, which is really just

441
00:22:49.290 --> 00:22:51.720
an integer. So you can
type color is equivalent of

442
00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:55.470
typing int you don't have
to write publics, you know,

443
00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:57.300
whatever. I don't even know
what this is anymore. Cause

444
00:22:57.300 --> 00:23:00.480
I use prostitutes so much
public stream void ARG, main

445
00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:03.120
blah, blah, blah, whatever you
don't need. The, the main

446
00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:05.340
and the main class. And
you don't need to extend

447
00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:08.220
this. You can kind of
get started in a simpler

448
00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:11.880
playground, but ultimately when it
gets compiled and run, the

449
00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:16.710
language itself is Java P
five is probably has no

450
00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:20.100
preprocessor. So it really is
just JavaScript. And P five

451
00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:22.860
itself has just the JavaScript
library. And I should also

452
00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:27.570
mention while we're here, the
third, third project that we

453
00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:29.730
did, we maintain as part
of the foundation is something

454
00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:33.750
called processing dot PI or
Python mode for processing. So

455
00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:36.480
it's a mode where you
can run the processing development

456
00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:40.170
environment and type all your
code using Python, but run

457
00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:43.260
the same kind of visual
sketches and visualizations, but write

458
00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:46.340
all your code in Python.
And actually this summer we're

459
00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:48.410
participating at Google summer of
code. And one of our

460
00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:51.170
Google summer of codes is
projects is called processing dot

461
00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:54.170
R, which is a speculative
idea of seeing if we

462
00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:57.740
could get a R mode
for processing where you right.

463
00:23:57.920 --> 00:23:59.660
Turn on processing, you switch
the mode to R and

464
00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:04.210
you type your code in
R To processing for all

465
00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:07.900
people. Yes. And yeah, I
mean, to me, this is

466
00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:10.390
key, you know, while processing
started as a very specific

467
00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:14.140
thing, I do think that
the, the way of thinking

468
00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:16.720
the way the API is
designed, the way the community,

469
00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:20.290
it works, that sort of,
those are the core elements

470
00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:24.700
of processing for me. I
remember when it very, very,

471
00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:28.270
very first came out in
2001. And because it happened

472
00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:30.340
to pick an, you know,
processing is kind of a

473
00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:32.770
general word. I was like,
how is anyone ever going

474
00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:35.980
to go and Google for
that? It's like, you know,

475
00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:37.780
you type processing, you don't
get to the answer or

476
00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:39.820
the definition of what the
word processing means. You go

477
00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:43.210
right to processing.org, which is
pretty fantastic. And then you're

478
00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:45.850
right there on the homepage.
Yeah. It actually used to

479
00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:49.150
be processed fiving, which instead
of two S's in the

480
00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:51.940
middle, it was two fives.
And that, I can't remember

481
00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:55.450
if the original reason was
because the domain wasn't available

482
00:24:55.450 --> 00:24:57.760
or it was to try
to help with the Google

483
00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:01.030
search. And that's actually where
the, the sort of shorthand

484
00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:07.210
<inaudible> comes from the old
style <inaudible>, which is pretty

485
00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:09.190
terrible thing to say, to
have to say. So I

486
00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:11.500
think I'm happy even the
processing has its Google search

487
00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:14.530
problem in the end. I
kind of, I like the

488
00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:19.300
name. So it's been 16
plus years started by students.

489
00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:22.240
And now there's a foundation.
How challenging has it been

490
00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:24.750
to deal with or manage
the idea of this foundation?

491
00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:27.160
And, and people still think
that they can run an

492
00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:30.940
entire class or a whole
school all about processing and

493
00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:33.460
then not pay anything for
it. Right. Well, this is

494
00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:35.440
a great question. I actually,
I'm glad you asked, because

495
00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:37.540
I guess I could plug
some of our new fundraising

496
00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:41.020
things that we're, that we're
attempting to do here. But

497
00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:43.060
so one thing I say
what's always been interesting to

498
00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:45.040
me is there's a bit
of a, there's often a

499
00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:47.700
misconception. I'll find someone will
come up to me or

500
00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:49.870
I'll talk to me and
ask questions about processing and

501
00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:52.840
sort of think of it
as there's this like institution

502
00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:55.600
almost like Adobe. Like there
must be this building somewhere

503
00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:58.090
where all the hundreds of
people are working away to

504
00:25:58.090 --> 00:26:00.820
develop processing. And really over
the years, it's always just

505
00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:04.360
been kind of volunteers and
nights and weekends. And you

506
00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:06.910
know, over the years, as
you know, a lot of

507
00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:10.090
us core maintainers are, you
know, getting older or have

508
00:26:10.090 --> 00:26:13.390
different commitments, it's been sort
of harder to keep that

509
00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:16.600
going. So that was really
the impetus for the foundation,

510
00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:19.870
but, you know, and we
we've had conversations about, well,

511
00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:21.820
should we charge for this,
not charged for this? And

512
00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:23.710
I think we've come to
the conclusion that it's very

513
00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:29.230
important that this is free
and open source, but free

514
00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:32.740
doesn't, you know, free doesn't
mean it doesn't cost anything

515
00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:35.530
to make it. So what
we've started doing now is

516
00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:40.120
we have a kind of
NPR style membership program where

517
00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:45.210
you can sign up to
become a individual member. You

518
00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:48.330
know, the suggested donation is
$25 per year. And we

519
00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:51.420
have institutional members. If you're
a, you know, a design

520
00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:53.970
firm and you use the
software or you're a school

521
00:26:53.970 --> 00:26:56.190
and you teach with the
software. So we're asking people

522
00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:58.080
to support the foundation. It's
a, you know, for, at

523
00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:02.670
least for us individuals, it's
a tax deductible donation. And

524
00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:05.940
what we're doing with that
money is funding a development

525
00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:12.240
on the software fellowships around
diversity community and education. And

526
00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:15.270
you, you can find out
a lot more@processingfoundation.org and see

527
00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:17.100
the kinds of initiatives and
things that we're running and

528
00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:20.990
using the money for. Okay.
So this isn't like going

529
00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:25.610
to your, like your rent.
This is about supporting the

530
00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:28.040
foundation, the people who support
the foundation and the multiple

531
00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:31.040
people, that many people that
write code to make processing

532
00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:34.790
and all of its varying
flavors work. Yeah. We published

533
00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:37.130
a medium post that goes
through kind of how our

534
00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:39.470
budget works and what we
spend the money on, which,

535
00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:42.500
you know, people can probably
find, you can also find

536
00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:45.320
through the website, but yeah,
the primary use of the

537
00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:49.340
money is we have a
few kind of, I don't

538
00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:51.920
know, staff or employees who
are kind of helping to

539
00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:56.150
administer and run the programs
around different initiatives and in

540
00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:59.960
preschool around advocacy. And then
most of the other money

541
00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:03.140
goes to our fellowship program
and also like hiring developers

542
00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:05.030
on a kind of ad
hoc basis to work on

543
00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:06.740
projects every once in a
while that we use a

544
00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:08.630
little bit of money for
travel for people to get

545
00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:11.210
together, to meet and that
type of thing. But yeah,

546
00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:14.270
that's, it's, you know, it's,
it's still a very small

547
00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:18.200
budget. No, I understand. I
just think it's important that

548
00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:21.230
people understand that, that this
is open source as much

549
00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:24.780
more than just people in
their spare time. And it

550
00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:27.740
it's, it's inappropriate for people
to go and demand support

551
00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:30.740
for this free software that
they were not involved with

552
00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:32.510
in any way, and did
not give any money to

553
00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:35.390
in any way. Right. And
I have a real luxury

554
00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:37.100
in that. I have a
full time job at a

555
00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:40.250
university and, you know, part
of the risk, my responsibility

556
00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:41.840
in my job is to
do, I don't know. I

557
00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:44.480
think there were just research
or something like that, but

558
00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:49.160
I really, I consider my
contribution to open source and

559
00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:51.980
administering the processing foundation and
working on developing these tools

560
00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:55.160
part of my job at
NYU. And I think that

561
00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:57.230
a lot of other people
who would like to contribute

562
00:28:57.230 --> 00:28:59.540
and get involved with open
source, it's not so easy

563
00:28:59.630 --> 00:29:02.300
to volunteer and have the
time to volunteer. So we

564
00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:05.930
want to have, we want
to make the developer community

565
00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:09.350
really inclusive that people who
can volunteer can volunteer, but

566
00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:12.470
also people who want to
participate, but funding would really

567
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:16.010
be helped, whether it's for
a daycare or a rent

568
00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:18.410
that we have some resources
to be able to do

569
00:29:18.410 --> 00:29:22.190
that as well. That's fantastic.
There is so much great

570
00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:26.780
information@processing.org there's tutorials, and there's
the huge reference. You can

571
00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:28.700
install it and get all
the different flavors that we

572
00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:31.910
talked about. And you can
also go to check out

573
00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:35.390
coding, train, and all the
great creative coding video tutorials

574
00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:37.970
that Daniel has made. And
he's also got a Patriot

575
00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:40.340
to help support that work
that he does again on

576
00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:43.270
the side, because you just
love To, to teach. It

577
00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:46.380
sounds like I do. I
think, you know, there was

578
00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:48.450
a while where I thought,
Oh, am I an artist?

579
00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:50.640
Am I making like art
with this code stuff that

580
00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:53.460
I'm learning about? And then
I think I discovered, no,

581
00:29:53.490 --> 00:29:56.760
I think I like just
helping other people think I

582
00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:59.850
get more kind of enjoyment
about just figuring stuff out

583
00:29:59.850 --> 00:30:03.210
and making it easier for
other people and seeing what

584
00:30:03.210 --> 00:30:05.250
they create. So the one
thing I really love that

585
00:30:05.250 --> 00:30:06.870
I'll encourage people who are
listening, or if you make

586
00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:08.490
something, if you saw a
tutorial and made something and

587
00:30:08.490 --> 00:30:10.500
processing, please share it with
me. Cause I really do

588
00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:12.990
enjoy seeing the wide variety
of stuff that people are

589
00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:16.290
creating. Very cool. Well, thanks
so much for talking with

590
00:30:16.290 --> 00:30:18.360
me today. I really appreciate
you. Thanks so much for

591
00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:21.090
having me. This was really
fun. This has been another

592
00:30:21.090 --> 00:30:23.910
episode of Hanselminutes and we'll
see you again next week.
