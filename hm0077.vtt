Scott and Carl, talk about
moving to a hosted email

9
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.870
provider. Hi, this is Carl Franklin
and you're listening to Hansel

10
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.660
minutes from Hanselman it's dot
com. I'm here with Scott

11
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.360
this week. Hi Scott. Hey,
how are you, sir? I'm

12
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.770
fine. You enjoying your, a
hiatus before you jumped ship

13
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.910
over to the motherland? Yeah,
it's definitely weird. I don't

14
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.210
like being idle. Yeah, it's
supposed to be vacation. What

15
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.850
I'm learning, I'm learning. Right?
So this is going to

16
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.610
be an interesting show. Well,
it is because we were

17
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.770
originally going to talk about
debugging and I think we'll

18
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.130
still do one on debugging
next week, but I was,

19
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.320
I sent you an email
and I'd asked you if

20
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.890
you'd received it yet, or
you were searching, we were

21
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.080
searching for an old email.
It was an old email

22
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.360
you wanted me to look
for. Right? I wanted you

23
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.980
to look for an old
email cause of a missing

24
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.770
package that was sent. Right.
And you said you couldn't

25
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.390
do it because you hadn't
been in the office in

26
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.790
a while and that's what
your searchable archive was. Right.

27
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.560
And you said you had
some kind of a plan

28
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.620
with a 16 gig flash
drive. So yeah. So you,

29
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.770
so here's my email system,
right? I, I have a

30
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.640
mail server and it's not
exchange, first of all, I

31
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.220
don't do active directory. That's
not my thing. You know,

32
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.600
so setting up exchange is
probably not an option for

33
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.670
me. And it, you know,
it's just a matter of

34
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.640
pain in the ass factor.
You know, I'm not an,

35
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.890
I'm not an it guy.
I don't have a whole

36
00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.050
lot of users. It's just
me and a few people

37
00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.710
here. None of them have
accounts on my machines. Everybody's

38
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.260
like internet accounts, it's all
popped three. So I have

39
00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.650
all tens M Damon and
their outlook style web client

40
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.530
is okay, but it's not
great. And it has little

41
00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.280
bugs. Like when somebody sends
you a invitation to a

42
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.780
meeting, it doesn't take into
account time zones. So it'll

43
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.180
say, you know, 9:00 AM Pacific
time, you know, whatever it

44
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.370
is. And it'll go in
at the wrong time, it'll

45
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.130
go in three hours early
or late, or what are

46
00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.830
you doing? Hosted exchange. You
can buy an exchange server

47
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.050
and have it handled for
you entirely Outsourced for 40,

48
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.260
50 bucks a month. Yeah.
It's just something I don't

49
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.570
don't want to deal with.
Right. I want to either

50
00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.600
con I'm a control freak,
right? I want things to

51
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.470
run under my own domain.
So Hosted exchange can run

52
00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.200
under your own domain. You're
right. That is an option,

53
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.300
but it means giving up
some, a certain amount of

54
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.970
control, which I enjoy. So
I know that if there's

55
00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.890
a problem with it, I
can solve it. Is the

56
00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.410
control about holding onto your
email, like having it in

57
00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.440
your control, like in the
sense of having the bits

58
00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.600
or the bytes available to
you, or is it about

59
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.120
your domain Much? That's it?
I like to, I like

60
00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.720
to know where my data
is all the time and

61
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.190
I, you know, I just
need to know that I

62
00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.100
have access to everything and
I don't, I really dread

63
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.900
the idea of getting on
the phone with somebody at

64
00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.910
three in the morning so
that I can get access

65
00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.920
to a file or something
like that. I just don't,

66
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.390
you know, that's the kind
of stuff that I don't

67
00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.560
want to do. So I
have, I have outlook and

68
00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.100
I'm my main machine here
at work. I used to

69
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.920
have my main outlook box,
be my laptop, but it

70
00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.630
proved to be too much
of a pain to back

71
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.360
up all the time. So
I have a big raid

72
00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.640
system here at work and
my outlook PST file is

73
00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.360
on there. Okay. So when
I need to search for

74
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.120
old emails, I need to
be on my machine at

75
00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.180
work. Okay. So that's the
story. So I think, I

76
00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.480
think you're insane. Yes, I
am insane. Yeah. That's just,

77
00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.560
that's ridiculous. So I thought
about getting a 16 gig

78
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.740
flash cards so I could
carry my PSD file around

79
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.530
with me. So then I
could use it on, you

80
00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.990
know, my laptop. I could
use it at work. I

81
00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.060
could use it at home
or whatever, and backing up

82
00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.400
should be a little bit
easier. Huh? Okay. That's just

83
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.000
what I thought. Okay. Until
I spoke to you. Yeah.

84
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.770
So I think that's just
the craziest thing I've ever

85
00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.050
heard. And I've heard a
lot of crazy stuff and

86
00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.160
I do a lot of
crazy stuff too. I'm a

87
00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.960
total control freak, but I
recently moved my whole family

88
00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.280
over to Gmail. I considered
windows live for domains. We'll

89
00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.560
talk about that too. But
at the end of June,

90
00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.500
I moved the entire handsome
and family on three continents

91
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.370
and 11 family members over
to Gmail, which is basically

92
00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.350
moving them over to Google
apps. I didn't move them

93
00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:11.040
to the gmail.com domain. I
actually signed up for Google

94
00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.730
apps for domains. This is
a service that Google offers,

95
00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:22.920
Right? It's a google.com/a, and
basically you set up your

96
00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:26.520
MX record, right? Your male
trans transfer record for your

97
00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.930
DNS, such that Gmail is
in charge of it. Right.

98
00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.180
And then you set up
what are called C name

99
00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.710
aliases. And that's like basically
pointing a subdomain at, at

100
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.310
Google. Sure. This is all
DNS stuff. Right? Yeah. Very,

101
00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.550
very simple stuff that control
panels now may have been

102
00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.770
difficult years ago where you'd
have to actually edit a

103
00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.940
text file and you know,
have Telnet access. But now

104
00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.820
with all of the different
control panels that your ISP

105
00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.680
is provide you, it's a
very simple operation. And Google

106
00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.980
has even made a, a
real simple wizard that even,

107
00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.290
you know, my dad could
go through, whereas it's basically,

108
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.890
what's your ISP, you know,
click here. Here's a screencast

109
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:09.620
to explain exactly how you
need to log in and

110
00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.280
enter these values into these
boxes. And they've got step-by-step

111
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.760
for all the major ISP.
Yeah. So I pointed things

112
00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:24.170
like mail dot, hanselman.com, calender.hanselman.com.
I've even got docs like

113
00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:28.430
documents.hanselman.com. Okay. So my wife
and I can share kind

114
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:32.950
of word and Excel, like
applications that are all Ajax

115
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.370
based. Okay. And I, I
imported all my outlook email.

116
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:40.910
I used a program called
G move G move from

117
00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:44.330
a company called limit none.
And I, I paid, I

118
00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:46.850
think 25 bucks or something
for this program. And I

119
00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:51.410
moved two plus gigs of
outlook email over to this

120
00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:57.400
thing, PST file. And you
uploaded it to Google. Well,

121
00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:00.370
it's pretty, it's a pretty
cheesy process right now, but

122
00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:03.220
yes, essentially, I did. What,
what you do is G

123
00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:08.140
move hosts, a intermediate format.
I'm an intermediate place. So

124
00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:11.860
basically G move uses Ole
automation to talk to outlook

125
00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:15.730
uses the outlook automation interfaces
takes all of your email

126
00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.710
on a folder by folder
basis or by a date

127
00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:19.660
range. It's up to you.
You can decide if you

128
00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:22.300
want to do it by
folder a folder plus date

129
00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:24.880
range. I think I said
all folders for the last

130
00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.370
two years or something like
that. It sends it up

131
00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:29.470
to G move and holds
it in a middle place

132
00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:33.250
and then makes a fake
pop server. And then basically

133
00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:37.180
Google sucks it in via
pop. Oh. And it looks

134
00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:40.420
like the email came exactly
as before. I mean, it

135
00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:42.490
doesn't, it doesn't look like
it's coming from you. It

136
00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:45.010
looks like it came as
it as it. Okay. No

137
00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:47.050
pop three can do that.
I mean, you just get

138
00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:50.050
the originally, right? Yeah. And
G and G move, even

139
00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:52.420
though they're sending it to
themselves, they modify the header

140
00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:54.700
is such that it looks
like it's a fresh import

141
00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:57.670
from pop. Okay. And then
if you pay Google, Google

142
00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:59.740
has two different things. They
have the free version, which

143
00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:04.210
is two gigs per user
and it's free. And then

144
00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:07.780
they have the $50 per
user per year, which gives

145
00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:10.870
you 10 gigs. But it
also gives you I'm app

146
00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:14.290
import support. So if you
have an iMac folder already,

147
00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:17.020
or any email with a,
with a public I'm app

148
00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:20.200
available, all right. Count, it'll
just suck all that over,

149
00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:22.900
Slow down a little bit.
Basically what you're saying is,

150
00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:26.740
Oh, now I have like
a hundred accounts at Franklin's

151
00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:30.880
dot net, your family, friends,
whatever. And I also have

152
00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:34.090
some other domains that I
host here. So you're saying

153
00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:37.000
I could keep all of
those domains, the, the, the,

154
00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:40.480
the same names. No, it's
not going to be Franklin's

155
00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:46.190
net@gmail.com. It's going to be
Franklin's dot net, right? Absolutely

156
00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:49.030
Franklins net. So for example,
I've just logged into the

157
00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:53.740
dashboard for Google maintenance. So
I'm at the hanselman.com Google

158
00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:58.320
dashboard, and it says welcome
Hanselman family. It says all

159
00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:01.800
services are running smoothly. It
actually says this daily active

160
00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:05.250
users, 11 active users in
the last 90 days, I

161
00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:08.190
can click on the 11
users. It has an option

162
00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:10.860
where I can go in
upload and provision all of

163
00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:14.160
my users. It also has
a web service available, such

164
00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.130
that I could provision my
users remotely. So I could

165
00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:20.510
write an, I could write
an administration application. Sounds like

166
00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:24.170
it's got full features, but
last I knew Gmail was

167
00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:26.510
an invite only kind of
thing. Is that still true?

168
00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:28.340
No, no. That's you can,
anyone can sign up for

169
00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:31.340
Gmail, but this isn't Gmail.
This is Google apps. Gmail

170
00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:34.160
hasn't been even invite only
for many, Many, many months

171
00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:37.400
really. Okay. Shows what I
know A totally separate universe.

172
00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:41.360
This is Google apps and
you're getting something that looks

173
00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:43.790
at like Gmail behaves like
Gmail, but the domain is

174
00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:46.250
yours. And I guess, you
know, the thing that hits

175
00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:49.160
me all of a sudden
is you, you know, when,

176
00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.380
when you want to search
for emails, it's in one

177
00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:56.330
place and it's Google. Right.
Exactly. And one of the

178
00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:58.100
things that's nice about it
is that there's even a

179
00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:01.970
mobile version. So I can
log into my email on

180
00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:06.110
my windows mobile device, and
I get a tiny HTML

181
00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:08.270
version and I can search
all my email from there.

182
00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:10.010
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I
can do that too with

183
00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:12.440
my web server. And, you
know, it sounds like a

184
00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:15.200
lot of the same things
that my mail server does.

185
00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:18.380
It just sounds like it
does it better. What do

186
00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:20.510
you mean? How can you
search all of your email?

187
00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:22.850
Yeah. Well, if I kept
all, if I moved all

188
00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:26.240
the email from my PST
file onto my mail server,

189
00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.880
like back, okay. I could
do the same thing and

190
00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:31.550
I could just run the
web client via which format

191
00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:34.340
VI map I could do
it with CSV. Right. So

192
00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:37.400
I could, I could export
to CSV. I could upload

193
00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:41.120
an import into, into my
domains and then could have

194
00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:45.200
web access. But, but the
fact is, well, the fact

195
00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:48.680
is is that the client,
the web client is just

196
00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:51.950
not that Good. Yeah. I
mean, I'm really surprised that

197
00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:56.060
you would compare that kind
of crazy hack to something

198
00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:59.340
like a complete provisioning system
for user manual. Well, I,

199
00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:01.610
I take offense at that.
It's not a crazy hack.

200
00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:05.570
It's a, it's a, it's
a mail server system that

201
00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:09.020
has a web interface. It's
a fully it's in physics,

202
00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:10.730
smarter mail. Or do you
know what the name of

203
00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:12.800
the, in fact it does
all of the things that

204
00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:15.680
you've said so far, and
it doesn't pretty well, except

205
00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:19.400
that there's a few killer
features that, that are deal

206
00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.800
breakers. Do you know what
the name of the mail

207
00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:23.840
system is? There's a lot
of the different things I

208
00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:29.630
like. Yeah. It's M Damon
from Alton and Damon. M

209
00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:33.620
D a E M O
N. And it's what I've

210
00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:36.080
been using for years and
years and years. But another

211
00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.880
reason that I want to
move away from it is

212
00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:42.380
because it's freaking expensive. It
used to be like, you

213
00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:45.500
pay like four 99, you
get the server and then

214
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:48.200
updates were free. And then
they started doing this, you

215
00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:52.400
know, you got to get
upgrade protection. Well, otherwise you

216
00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:56.220
can't get updates and it's
not. Yeah. They're out. They

217
00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:58.640
have an outlook connector. Do
you use that one? Yeah,

218
00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:01.770
I have used that, but
I don't really need an

219
00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:04.770
outlook connector. What I needed
was to be able to

220
00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:08.820
just move. Yeah. Once, and
then I'm looking at their

221
00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:11.310
site here. And if you
have a hundred users, it's

222
00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:15.780
$720 for their outlook connector.
Yeah. Yeah, exactly. That's pretty

223
00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:18.330
harsh. No, it is it's
and that's exactly what I'm

224
00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:21.420
saying. I want to move
away from this and into

225
00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:25.740
something else, but in certainly,
you know, the alternative is

226
00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:30.150
moving your PSD file around
on your, on a, on

227
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:32.730
a, on a 16 gig
stick. But you know, that

228
00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:35.430
doesn't help the rest of
my users. Well, one of

229
00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:38.280
the things that I like
about the Google premier edition,

230
00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:41.370
this is the one that
you actually pay for is

231
00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:45.930
that there's a 99.9% uptime
guarantee. Yeah. No, well, I

232
00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:48.420
would exceed that less. Right.
So you get that Google

233
00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:51.180
level of uptime and I've
never had them been down

234
00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:53.610
in the last two months.
So that's not a very

235
00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.950
lot of, a lot of
data to calculate, you know,

236
00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:59.040
as far as uptime, but
it's, it's been very nice

237
00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:02.190
because there has not been
a single problem. And being

238
00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:04.560
able to go in and
reset my user's password. I

239
00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.120
mean, it seems like these
are small things. I mean,

240
00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:08.340
you can do these, like
you say, with any commercially

241
00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:12.120
available email server. Yeah. But
it's just so clean. It's

242
00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:13.920
just so simple. I can,
like right now I can

243
00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:17.250
see who's used a certain
amount of space in their

244
00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:19.800
quota. I can up their
quotas. I can change their,

245
00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:23.220
you know, it's just, all
these different things are very

246
00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:27.840
clean, very simple. I can
create internal lists and also

247
00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:29.730
we have the Google calendar
so we can share our

248
00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:33.420
calendar now Of the premiere
edition. Right. Does that mean

249
00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:35.880
that everybody on your domain
has to have the PR

250
00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:39.780
has to pay $50 per
year? Yeah, exactly. Okay. So

251
00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:42.090
if you have multiple domains,
what I would do if

252
00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:45.300
you were switching over is
I would decide which domain

253
00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:47.760
is the most important to
you. There's two ways you

254
00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:51.540
can do this. You could
just go free, right? All

255
00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:53.370
you, all you lose with
the free one is you

256
00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:56.580
get two gigs instead of
10. And there's no uptime

257
00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:59.280
guarantee, which means that if
they were down, then they're

258
00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:03.030
down. Right. Okay. And then
you could go bonkers. That

259
00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:06.360
could be totally free, but
it's advertiser supported, right? So

260
00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:07.980
you still have the little
ads on the side. Oh,

261
00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:10.290
I see. So you switch
over to the premier, you

262
00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:13.020
get the 10 gigs, you
get the provisioning tools and

263
00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:16.290
the web service, and you
get to remove the ads,

264
00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:19.440
but then you, you do
have to pay $50 per

265
00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:23.490
user, per year. So for
us, with the family, it

266
00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:25.440
was nice and simple. They
just pay me the 50

267
00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:28.020
bucks. I send it off
to Google and everyone gets

268
00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:31.680
this benefit. We get shared
family, Google chat, we get

269
00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:36.210
shared calendars. So from a
family perspective or an organizational

270
00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:40.170
perspective, it's great. A lot
of universities are doing this.

271
00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:42.300
They've got a set up
now where a university can

272
00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:46.440
basically outsource all their email
to Google, which is nice

273
00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:48.930
for the kids now, because
it looks a lot more

274
00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:51.560
like the stuff that they're
used to be using rather

275
00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:56.240
than like Elm or whatever
the university system is. And

276
00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:59.480
then the university could potentially
use the free version and

277
00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:01.910
not pay anything so they
can save, you know, tens

278
00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:04.850
of thousands of dollars a
year, but you can have

279
00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:07.490
multiple accounts, right? You have
multiple domains, you don't have

280
00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:09.110
to sign all of them
up if you don't want

281
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:12.290
to. But at the same
time, if some of your

282
00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:15.590
domains are aliases, you could
go into Doug. Right now,

283
00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:18.290
I'm going into domain settings
and I'm going under domain

284
00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:21.680
names. I have my primary
domain and I have three

285
00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:26.630
domain aliases. So users can
share the same mailbox with

286
00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:31.730
the different addresses. So you
could have karl@franklins.net. You could

287
00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:33.560
have Carl at <inaudible> dot
com. They'd go to the

288
00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:37.990
same place. Okay. Now you
mentioned that windows live.com also

289
00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:44.680
has Similar service, right? so@domains.live.com,
they've got the, the new

290
00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:47.530
windows live custom domains. So
it's a real similar kind

291
00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:50.350
of a service. You get
windows, live mail, which looks

292
00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:54.160
like windows, Hotmail. You can
have an, basically an unlimited

293
00:15:54.160 --> 00:16:00.220
number of accounts. You get
a hundred accounts initially. And

294
00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:01.990
then once you've proven that
you kind of own the,

295
00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:06.280
that you own the, the
product and funnel out, you

296
00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:07.780
have to fill out a
questionnaire. Then you can have

297
00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:09.610
an unlimited number of counts.
So you could have a

298
00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:13.390
hundred, 200, 500 accounts. And
then the accounts that you

299
00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:17.980
get on that particular custom
domain also automatically become windows

300
00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:21.100
spaces. So they can have
a blog and they become

301
00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:24.700
messenger logins. So then they
immediately become something that can

302
00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:27.340
be logged into messenger. So
it's integrated with the whole

303
00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:31.660
kind of live family of
services. Is it free? Yeah,

304
00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:34.300
it is. It is free.
Let me go ahead and

305
00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:36.910
just I'll, I'm gonna click
get started and I'm going

306
00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:38.770
to say, you can click
get started and it says,

307
00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:41.680
purchase a domain or use
a domain you already own,

308
00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:44.470
I can say, purchase a
new domain and they have

309
00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:46.240
a questionnaire where I can
go in and say, I

310
00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:48.970
want to let go to
register.com. And then they'll send

311
00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:53.020
me through this questionnaire and
I could potentially buy a

312
00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:55.510
domain right there on the
spot. I'm going to go

313
00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:58.120
ahead and put in that.
I want to use hanselman.com

314
00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:00.340
and see what the process,
where the process takes me.

315
00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:03.340
So here it says, well,
do you want handsome undock

316
00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:07.690
Scott hanselman.com to be the
administrator. So it's basically saying,

317
00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:11.080
you know, do you have
an existing live ID that

318
00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:14.620
you want to do? Administration
of this particular site? It's

319
00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:18.790
a very, very clean, kind
of a familiar interface. It

320
00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:21.640
looks a lot like, like
Hotmail and like windows live,

321
00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:23.320
like the stuff that we're
kind of used to seeing,

322
00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:25.840
right. I'm going to say,
go ahead and make Scott

323
00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:28.090
the administrator. And then it
pops in and it says

324
00:17:28.090 --> 00:17:30.910
service configuration. It says, well,
I need you to do

325
00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:33.550
this with your DNS. You
can go in and click

326
00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:38.680
on membership accounts and a
sign up. So it looks

327
00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:41.320
like it's free. It looks
like it's free for life.

328
00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:46.750
And I don't see anything
anywhere about quotas about this

329
00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:49.740
space or anything like that.
When it first came out

330
00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:52.560
last Year, it was 250
megs. And I believe that

331
00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:55.020
when windows live mail was
released, it was upgraded to

332
00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:58.130
two gigs. Yeah. I think
I saw something on dig

333
00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:02.540
about Mo this was about
backup, which I think like

334
00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:05.960
both Google and Microsoft are
now sort of battling for

335
00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:10.580
online, offline backup strategies. And
they're offering a whole bunch

336
00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:13.430
of gigabytes for free. I
think that was something different.

337
00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:16.070
Yeah. This is representative of
moving your life into the

338
00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:19.190
cloud. Right? Right. I mean,
think about what we would

339
00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:22.670
have felt five, 10 years
ago to, to put all

340
00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:24.980
of my inbox and all
of my calendar into a,

341
00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:29.480
into a cloud system like
this. Right. But we built

342
00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:32.300
up trust, right? When Hotmail
runs for years without too

343
00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:35.510
many downs and a Gmail
ones for years. I mean,

344
00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:37.760
I think I've, I can
count on one hand how

345
00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:40.080
many times I've hit google.com
and have it been done?

346
00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:42.920
Yeah. I've never, never had
like three or three or

347
00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:45.800
four Times and I hit
refresh and it's back. Right.

348
00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:50.180
You know, little hiccups. So
though that, that trust is

349
00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:52.550
you can't just say, click
a button here, move your

350
00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:55.160
life into the cloud. It
took years of trust for

351
00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:58.160
me, you know, Google did
what I wanted it to

352
00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:02.390
do. I like the, the
Gmail interface. And it was

353
00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:05.180
really easy to move the
whole family over. And I

354
00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:07.610
was able to, to let
the family continue to have

355
00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:11.120
their, their same email addresses.
I went and because they're

356
00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:13.580
my family, I went and
asked them what their passwords

357
00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:15.140
were. And I set their
passwords up to, they were

358
00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:17.270
exactly the same. That was
made a lot of people

359
00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:20.510
more comfortable. Yeah. Now what
about if you don't like

360
00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:22.700
it, can you move it
back, Jack? What, with, with

361
00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:25.520
windows live, you can always
turn around and move it

362
00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:27.950
back. Right. You know, any
change that you make to

363
00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:31.370
something like a DNS can
always be, be turned around

364
00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:33.170
so you can switch back
if you don't, if you

365
00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:36.050
don't like it. Although one
of the things that's nice

366
00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:38.930
about Google domains that I
haven't seen on the windows

367
00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:42.680
live custom domains is that
they'll give you a temporary

368
00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:49.160
email address on Google without
changing your, without changing your

369
00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:52.040
DNS. So for example, you
sign up for Google apps

370
00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.770
and not quite sure if
you like it yet. What

371
00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:56.810
you can do is set
a rule on your current

372
00:19:56.810 --> 00:20:00.770
email system that you want
your email temporarily forwarded. Then

373
00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:03.170
they'll give you a funky
email address. Like if I

374
00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:07.280
was going to be Scott
hanselman.com, they'll say like Scott

375
00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:13.700
hyphen enhancement.com and then someGood@gmail.com,
basically a throwaway address that

376
00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:16.970
no one would ever ever
see you set up forwarding

377
00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:19.250
to go to that temporary
place. And then that lets

378
00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:22.280
you see your email in
two places. So it stays

379
00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:24.290
where it is. Your existing
system stays the way it

380
00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:26.150
is. And then you can
also see it in Gmail.

381
00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:28.460
And if you like it,
then switch over and then

382
00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:31.850
you're, then you're set, but
you've never made the DNS

383
00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:33.890
change. So it doesn't matter.
So I found the fact

384
00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:38.180
for windows live custom domains.
If you go to domains.live.com

385
00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:39.890
and click on help, which
is in the upper right

386
00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:42.890
hand corner, there's a FAQ.
And it tells you where

387
00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:45.770
the windows live custom domains.
You can use your own

388
00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:48.880
custom domain name to send,
receive emails and instant messages,

389
00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:52.120
which we've been talking about.
Create up to a hundred

390
00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:54.850
email accounts within your domain.
So if you need more

391
00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:57.880
accounts, you can apply to
receive unlimited number. So I

392
00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:00.770
suppose I don't know what
that application involves. There's a

393
00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:02.580
questionnaire that they ask you
to fill out and then

394
00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:04.380
once you fill out the
questionnaire, you can get unlimited.

395
00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:08.250
Okay. And then receive two
gigabytes of inbox storage space

396
00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:12.030
for each of your accounts
with windows live Hotmail, check

397
00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:14.820
your email from any web
computer controlled junk email with

398
00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.230
a Microsoft smart screen technology,
receive email virus, scanning and

399
00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:23.250
cleaning and interact. Yeah, right
there. You just nailed two

400
00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:26.400
things that were huge for
me now, junk email and

401
00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:30.040
virus scanning. This is a
really important thing. My, the,

402
00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:34.680
the folks that were handling
my email previously charged like

403
00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:37.470
10 bucks for virus scanning
and then 10 bucks for

404
00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:41.250
S for spam. Yeah. And
because my email address is

405
00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:44.130
so public spam was becoming
a huge problem for me.

406
00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:46.470
Right. And I was, I
mean, I get, you know,

407
00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:52.500
literally a hundred to one
spam spam to legitimate email,

408
00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:56.280
right? So I actually hired
a company called spam soap,

409
00:21:56.310 --> 00:22:00.900
which is basically a dedicated
to doing nothing but spam

410
00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:05.220
filtering for, for email. And
I was paying them $150

411
00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:09.450
every three months when I
switched over to Google, or

412
00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:11.310
if you switch over to
live domains, you get all

413
00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:14.310
of their spam filters and
all of their virus scanning

414
00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:17.010
and that's all built in.
So for me, I actually

415
00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:20.040
saved money by switching over
to a service that had

416
00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:24.480
much smarter spam. I've had
about six false positives. Once

417
00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:26.850
I set those up in
my white list, I don't

418
00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:29.250
think about spam anymore. And
that has been a huge

419
00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:32.400
benefit. So I think moving
to a big system like

420
00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:34.710
a Microsoft or Google would
be a benefit for anyone

421
00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:37.830
who gets an oppressive amount
of spam. Wow. This is,

422
00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:42.000
this is, this has been
a, definitely a life changing

423
00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.510
episode for me, Scott, because
you know, this, this has

424
00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:50.490
been a problem constantly throughout
my it career. A few

425
00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:53.430
more, if you want to
say that, so I'm, I'm

426
00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:55.620
going to do this. I'm
really going to do it.

427
00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:57.450
Yes. You're really induced. So
you need to, you need

428
00:22:57.450 --> 00:22:59.970
to do this. You need
to let's research them. Yeah.

429
00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:02.820
It's not just the money,
it's the hassle and the

430
00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:06.390
accessibility, you know, I'd be
really interested. Let's do some

431
00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:08.400
research offline and let's you
and I sit down and

432
00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.260
think about which ones ready
for you. You know what,

433
00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:13.290
if you prefer email, if
you prefer I'm going to

434
00:23:13.290 --> 00:23:16.260
do law, I'm going to
try live because you're doing

435
00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:18.630
Gmail, I'm doing live. That'd
be nice to be able

436
00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:21.600
to compare notes and see
what happens. Let's do that.

437
00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:24.090
And let's, we'll get some
of the, the live custom

438
00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:26.790
domain guys to, to maybe
help walk you through it.

439
00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:29.550
Maybe just move one of
your accounts that doesn't matter,

440
00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:31.980
or do a temporary switch
over. Well, I'm going to

441
00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:35.670
have to do it because
my, my mail server expires

442
00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:38.970
at the, probably in, in
a few weeks. So I'm

443
00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:41.850
going to Thing will be
how hard you ha, how

444
00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:44.910
hard of a time you
have transferring existing stuff. Right.

445
00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:49.190
Cause really for me, it
wasn't useful until I got

446
00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:51.850
at least the last six
months of email up. Yeah,

447
00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:55.420
Yeah. That would be really
interesting. I think that this

448
00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:58.240
is all representative of office
of us moving our lives

449
00:23:58.270 --> 00:24:01.450
into the cloud and not
feeling so bad about it,

450
00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:05.310
right? I mean 99.9 uptime
or, you know, you know,

451
00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:09.010
five nines, even these kinds
of uptimes were just on,

452
00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:12.910
you know, impossible to comprehend,
at least in the PC

453
00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:15.400
world and the web world,
certainly mainframes have this kind

454
00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:17.920
of uptime and a lot.
But what I'm saying is

455
00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:20.410
that we're so used to
our machines crashing. We're so

456
00:24:20.410 --> 00:24:23.800
used to having really lousy
service from the various service

457
00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:26.530
providers, whether it be cable,
I was looking at the

458
00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:29.920
Verizon Fios user agreement. You
know, I signed up recently

459
00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:32.560
with Fios, which is the
fiber optic internet service here

460
00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:35.440
in the U S right.
And it turns out that

461
00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:38.590
in the small print, it
says that there is absolutely

462
00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:43.000
no uptime guarantee. Hmm. I
have no way to get

463
00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.030
any money back or any
in anything if they're down,

464
00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:47.680
they're down and there's nothing
I can do about it.

465
00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:51.130
Think about it in terms
of the, the airline industry,

466
00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:53.680
right. They, how many times
you've been kicked off a

467
00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:58.900
plane because the, they overbook
Sure. Google or Microsoft did

468
00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:01.210
these things. If we, if
my Gmail suddenly said, Oh,

469
00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:03.880
you know, sorry, I had
a space, even though they

470
00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:06.400
had promised that I wouldn't
be, that would be pretty,

471
00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:09.550
pretty frustrating. They've gotten to
the point where they can

472
00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:12.700
actually provide these services in
a way that we can

473
00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:15.220
trust them. And I don't
feel bad about using these

474
00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:18.580
guys at Gmail because I'm
still downloading these things into

475
00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:21.430
outlook via pop. Right. So
I have a local archive.

476
00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:26.470
Right. Good. All right, Scott,
that's a shell. This is

477
00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:29.200
a good one. Like I
said, it's a life changing

478
00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:31.960
one for me. I'm going
to bite the bullet and

479
00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:35.410
we'll see you next week
on handsome minutes.
