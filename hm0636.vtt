Hi, This is Scott Hanselman.
This is another episode of

16
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.260
Hansel minutes today. I'm talking
with Nick Justine house from

17
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.370
I N C l.ca and
the accessibility rules podcast. How

18
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.910
are you, sir? I'm doing
pretty good. Scotch yourself. I'm

19
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.490
lovely. And thanks for chatting
with me today. You are

20
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.860
a speaker and a trainer
and a consultant on web

21
00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.480
accessibility and disability, and you're
actually a Francophone as well,

22
00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.810
a bilingual. Do you podcast
in both English and French?

23
00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.100
No, I started podcasting in
English, but I'm actually preparing

24
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.600
a couple episode in French
for ready for the best

25
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.080
tea day. 14th of July coming up
in a couple of months.

26
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.580
Alright, now you're up in
Canada? Yeah, Montreal. Alright, cool.

27
00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:42.980
So one of the things
that I wanted to talk

28
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.390
with you today about is
I noticed in April, end

29
00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.650
of April, that the web
content accessibility guidelines WC a

30
00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.660
G is at a proposed
recommendation. I knew that there

31
00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.400
was a content accessibility guidelines
too. That was, I want

32
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.060
to say 2008. Did we
just go from two to

33
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.580
2.1 and it took 10
years to do it. That's

34
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.640
right. It took 10 years
to get there. And it

35
00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.800
took quite a long time
to go from one to

36
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.740
two as well, but things
are pretty much on the

37
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.850
ball now. So we're going
to, to see a more

38
00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.620
rapid iteration in as much
that the W3C does not

39
00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.740
do anything quickly because their
standards and it's important to

40
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.340
get it right. But yeah,
we're, we're moving ahead with

41
00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.510
2.1, I have it on
good authority. That is going

42
00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.230
to be a proposed recommendation
in June. So as of

43
00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.740
next month, that's good not
to put too fine a

44
00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.170
point on it, but I'm
going to go out on

45
00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.060
a limb and say that
it's a lot has happened

46
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.190
in 10 years. Why is
this not 3.0 because they're

47
00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.020
working on silver, which is
actually going away from the,

48
00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:02.200
a denomination of content accessibility
Guidelines, that's actually going to

49
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.130
be called just the accessibility
guidelines. So the coordinating is

50
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.810
silver since accessibility guidelines is
AIG, which is on the

51
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.660
periodic table reflecting the name
of silver. So they, they

52
00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.330
needed to get something in
between to be able to

53
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.220
address some of the issues
in 2.0 that aren't addressed

54
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:32.560
around cognitive disabilities, around low
vision issues and a few

55
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.980
other things that we had
realized as experts that weren't

56
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.220
working quite as expected in
a, in two point. Oh,

57
00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.940
I see. Okay. So let
me see if I can

58
00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.780
paraphrase it if I understand
this. So 2.1 is a,

59
00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.490
is a revision or a
refinement of 2.0, which was

60
00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.160
well thought of and been
around for a while. So

61
00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.710
even though it's 10 years,
it's a good thing that

62
00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:59.160
we're kind of tightening the
screws on, on WC AIG

63
00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.200
2.0, and then the, the
element for silver as AIG.

64
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.900
So then that would explain
why it's codenamed silver, and

65
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.790
then that's going to be
the next generation, the next,

66
00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.960
the future of web access.
That's correct. It's important to

67
00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:18.960
understand that the upcoming 2.1
are not actually eliminating everything

68
00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:22.620
in 2.0 is kind of
a, an add on, so

69
00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.730
there's a series of success
criteria that are going to

70
00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:33.030
be added to, to the
guidelines, but they're not superseding

71
00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.540
what was there in the
past. So it's, it's extending

72
00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:41.460
and improving. What's already there.
Who are these guidelines for?

73
00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.770
Are they for me and
the listener who are web

74
00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.130
developers or are they for
the browser makers? The short

75
00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:51.930
answer is yes. Therefore for
everybody out there, the browser

76
00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.670
makers need to understand what's
happening on there because they

77
00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:01.440
may need to, to understand
how to implement some of

78
00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.160
the things under the hood,
but that's not really primarily

79
00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:10.240
domain thing. I think it's
mostly about the developers and

80
00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:14.490
the business owners out there
that want to make their

81
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.570
site or web based apps
accessible for people with disabilities.

82
00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.950
It's really kind of like
a blueprint of things that

83
00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.800
we need to do to
make sure that the site

84
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.810
works for, for everyone, regardless
of technology, assistive technology, etc.

85
00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.900
And there was a word
or a phrase that you

86
00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.950
put in there just a
moment ago, success criteria. That's

87
00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:40.350
a very important phrase. It's
kind of the thing that

88
00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:46.140
informs the entire working group.
Yeah. The web content accessibility

89
00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:51.000
guidelines are broken down into
different different elements. And first

90
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:58.460
there's four principles. Those are
elements must be perceivable, operable,

91
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:03.800
understandable, and robust based on
those four principle. Then we

92
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:08.480
have 12 guidelines and each
guidelines is broken down into

93
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.110
a success criteria. So we
may have things, for example,

94
00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:18.470
a success criteria. 1.1 0.1
is non-text content. That's basically

95
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:21.920
the success criteria that explains
that if you have an

96
00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:26.810
image, we have to have
alternate information about it for

97
00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:31.490
screen reader users. Basically of
course, if there's information about

98
00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:34.970
the image for screen reader,
users, suddenly there's information for

99
00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:40.940
search engine crawlers. An image
is not normally going to

100
00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:44.180
give very much information to,
to Google or Bing or

101
00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:49.250
other search engines. So these
success criteria is, are there

102
00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:51.890
to help us understand what
we need to do to

103
00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:57.010
make a page or an
app access. Hmm. Okay. And

104
00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:00.130
then this breaks down these
four principles of accessibility into

105
00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:02.380
like a little bit more
detail. So for example, the

106
00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:06.820
first one perceivable, it says
it can't be invisible to

107
00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:08.740
all of the senses. The
user has to have some

108
00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:12.130
way to get that information
that's right now, most people,

109
00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:14.860
I would say most kind
of like what is the

110
00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:18.550
term? If someone is not
disabled or not differently abled,

111
00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:21.850
we don't say normal, regular,
typical. What is the right

112
00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:27.040
phrase In the disability community?
We often jokingly say, instead

113
00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:31.360
of able-bodied, we'll say they're
temporarily able-bodied because at some

114
00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.940
point in our lives, we
all acquire some form of

115
00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:38.770
disability, whether it's a, it's
a temporary impairment, a situational

116
00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:44.410
impairment or a permanent one.
But I think that people

117
00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:51.130
without disabilities able bodied people,
I think these classifications ultimately

118
00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:57.100
are not particularly useful because
we obviously, the concept of

119
00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:01.390
accessibility is to help people
with disabilities, but these things

120
00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:05.170
help everyone. It, it really
comes down to usability. For

121
00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:09.130
example, there is a success
criteria and WCAB, that is

122
00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:12.280
about color contrast. So you
have to make sure that

123
00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:16.930
the text has enough contrast
against this background. And if

124
00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:20.410
I'm going to date the
specific for small texts, which

125
00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:24.310
is smaller than 18 point,
the color contrast ratio must

126
00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:27.460
be 4.5 to one. So
it's got to have a

127
00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:30.790
fair amount of contrast. So
if you're thinking great text

128
00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:34.240
on gray background, it's not
going to meet that success

129
00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:39.730
criteria from an accessibility perspective.
But if you go out

130
00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.820
and look at the side
that has great text on

131
00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:45.610
gray background on your phone
and you're in full sun,

132
00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:48.040
chances are, you're not going
to be able to see

133
00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:50.530
and make sense of what's
on the page anyways. So

134
00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:56.940
we're looking at tying things
that help people with disabilities

135
00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:00.450
that also help everybody else.
You know, that is a

136
00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:04.040
really Like if, if anyone
gets a message out of

137
00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.920
this podcast, in my opinion,
I think it would be

138
00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:10.550
that this isn't about web
developers who are listening to

139
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:13.640
the show thinking, eh, here's
some extra markup that I

140
00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:17.300
put on my website. So
1% of my users that

141
00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:21.320
aren't me can use my
website. It's really, here's a

142
00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:23.090
set of best practices that
are going to make the

143
00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:28.850
web Available to everyone better
for people who are Typically

144
00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:32.600
abled and much better for
people who are differently abled.

145
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:35.150
Is that fair? Okay. Yeah.
That's, that's fair to say

146
00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:37.760
that there's, there's all kinds
of examples like that. You

147
00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:41.210
know, w one of the
things that we recommend is

148
00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:43.870
use plain English when you're
out on your site. I

149
00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:46.940
assuming your site is in
English, right? So plain language.

150
00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:51.140
And that's really good for
people that have maybe cognitive

151
00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:55.730
impairments or learning disability like
dyslexia, but it's also really

152
00:09:55.730 --> 00:10:01.010
good for translation engines. Like,
you know, Google translate. It's

153
00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:04.670
also very good for people
that have maybe a situational

154
00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:09.200
impairment. Let's say you're a
mother of a, of a

155
00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:12.080
young baby. It's 4:00 AM. Your
baby is not doing too

156
00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.990
well. And you're juggling on
the one hand, the baby

157
00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:17.450
in your left arm. And
you're trying to look up

158
00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:21.680
information on your phone, on
the right arm, if things

159
00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:25.040
are written clearly and succinctly,
you're going to be able

160
00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:28.280
to get the information much
easier. So there's, you know,

161
00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:33.650
there's all kinds of information
of not information, but of

162
00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:37.970
concepts like that, that were
primarily for people with disabilities

163
00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:42.230
and, and kind of carry
over into a wider audience.

164
00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.890
Yeah. I noticed that there's
a bunch of really great

165
00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:49.100
features on my iPhone for
you, that you can allows

166
00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:51.620
you to use the iPhone
with one hand. I don't

167
00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:53.870
typically use it with one
hand, but again, you have

168
00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:57.020
groceries in one hand and
then you are situationally differently

169
00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:58.700
able then suddenly you're going
to want to be able

170
00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:01.220
to use those features. And
I just use them without

171
00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:03.410
thinking, I don't think of
them as accessibility features. And

172
00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:07.250
that's a, that's really useful.
Yeah. Incidentally, while we're talking

173
00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:10.400
about accessibility feature on the
iPhone and that applies to

174
00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:14.330
two other platforms, Android as
well. And a lot of

175
00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:18.980
these technology that we're using
now, without even really thinking

176
00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:23.780
about it actually started as
assistive technology. So, you know,

177
00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:27.110
one of the, one of
the primary example I gave

178
00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:31.010
in my, in my talk
about the evolution of assistive

179
00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:34.370
technology is, is the keyboard.
You know, the keyboard, as

180
00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:39.020
we know, it is pretty
much a devolution from a

181
00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:42.980
Hanson ball typewriter that, that
started in the 18 hundreds

182
00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:46.820
where director of a school
for the deaf wanted his

183
00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:49.910
deaf students to be able
to write and interact with

184
00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:53.030
people as fast as people
were talking. And from there

185
00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:56.740
evolve. So we were using
today a product that was

186
00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:01.120
initially conceived for people with
disabilities. If we're talking about

187
00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:05.950
Siri, the assistant is also
an evolution of that. There

188
00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:10.090
there's all kinds of things
that we use in pretty

189
00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:13.660
much every day that started
their life as product design

190
00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:17.310
for people with disabilities and
lo and behold, it's, it's

191
00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:21.000
actually really useful for everyone.
Yeah. And in fact, if

192
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.310
you take the series and
the Cortanas and the Alexa's

193
00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:27.240
of the world, they, they
are often faster and more

194
00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:30.420
convenient. I'm still trying to
convince my spouse that talking

195
00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:33.570
to Siri to search the
web is faster than using

196
00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:37.590
her thumbs. So sometimes we
have, you know, search races

197
00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:40.440
to see who can find
the information quicker. And usually

198
00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:43.560
asking a digital assistant is
a, is a better way

199
00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:47.010
than just capping it out.
Yeah. And the funny thing

200
00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:50.400
is, is that, you know,
these products that came into

201
00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:54.330
everyday use for us are
suddenly going through that circle

202
00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:57.690
again, or of being even
more useful for people with

203
00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:04.140
different disabilities. There was a,
a bunch of noise happening

204
00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:06.630
a few weeks ago, maybe
even a month ago, about

205
00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:11.100
how people who are blind
really are appreciating the ability

206
00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:14.790
to use Alexa for, for
all kinds of things. So

207
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.940
it's the circle. You know,
something comes for people with

208
00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:22.650
disabilities that goes into wide
use for everyday use, and

209
00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:26.130
then there's refinements on that.
And it helps people with

210
00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:29.340
disabilities and even more, One
of the things that I've

211
00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:33.570
been really happy about is
there there's, there are people

212
00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:35.940
who like closed captioning and
there are people who need

213
00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:38.370
closed captioning. I don't know
if it's because I'm getting

214
00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:40.560
older, but my wife and
I always watched television with

215
00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:43.710
the captioning on somehow I
make it, I don't know.

216
00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:46.770
It simultaneously makes my hearing
better and worse, but I

217
00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:48.750
never miss a word because
I bet the words on.

218
00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:52.200
Yeah, of course now I
can't watch a show without

219
00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:55.350
the captioning because I feel
like I'm missing something. But

220
00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:59.340
I've noticed that the, the
rise of Twitter is that

221
00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:02.700
all videos have captioning at
the bottom. And that, you

222
00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:04.890
know, you have like those
news videos that you can

223
00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:09.750
watch a video with audio
muted in line, like at

224
00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:13.110
a it's a DMV or
something. And I really enjoy

225
00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:15.000
that. I think that's a,
that's a benefit for everybody.

226
00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:18.960
Yeah. And it's also useful,
you know, captioning is useful.

227
00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:24.140
If you're trying to find
out information about something or

228
00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:27.150
other who you find a
tutorial on YouTube, you're in

229
00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:32.490
a cubicle, a large room
with dozens of people. You

230
00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:35.920
don't want everybody to listen
in as to what you're

231
00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:38.880
doing. You don't want to
disturb their ability to work

232
00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:42.540
or get on calls. So
suddenly captions are very helpful.

233
00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:45.960
Yeah. And that's one of
the reasons that, that this

234
00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:51.260
podcast has partnered with a
company called Gretta, G R

235
00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:54.830
E T T A.com. So
we have captioning and transcripts

236
00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:57.950
for all the episodes of,
of Hansel minutes. And I've

237
00:14:57.950 --> 00:15:02.390
also got captioning on my
other podcast, Azure Friday. And

238
00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:04.610
that works great. Not just
for people who, with a

239
00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:07.400
hearing disability, but with people
who are learning English, they

240
00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:11.900
can read and listen along.
Yes. I've been pushing so

241
00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:15.530
hard for everybody that I
know that podcasts provide transcripts

242
00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:19.010
because it makes a big
difference for, as you say,

243
00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:23.180
people that are not necessarily
native native English speakers. If

244
00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:27.380
someone is looking for information,
it's often faster for them

245
00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:30.650
to read a transcript faster
than they can sit through

246
00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:35.300
a half hour show. It's
also a question of making

247
00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:38.300
things accessible for people that
aren't able to listen to

248
00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:41.870
the show, but there was
a, a case study done

249
00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:45.830
by, by NPR when they
decided to put their transcripts

250
00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:50.180
on every single show for
this American life, they saw

251
00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:53.630
a whole bunch of benefits.
Suddenly they had more search

252
00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:56.690
engine results. They had more
people coming to the show.

253
00:15:56.690 --> 00:16:00.230
They had more people download
the show and they realized

254
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:03.980
they had an indexed transcript
of every single show they

255
00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:06.830
had. So they could find
information quite easily about what

256
00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:09.320
was on the show five
years ago or seven years

257
00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:13.780
ago. Absolutely. Hey folks, I
want to take a moment

258
00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:16.150
to thank our sponsors and
remind you that when you

259
00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:19.600
support them, you're supporting Hanselman
it's because they make this

260
00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:24.190
show possible. Innovative developers help
improve the lives of millions

261
00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:28.270
of small businesses and accountants
that use QuickBooks worldwide. Your

262
00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:30.730
app could make the difference
that helps them work smarter

263
00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:35.110
and put more money in
their pocket. Enter Intuit developer

264
00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:38.380
from tech tools to growing
your customer base, to helping

265
00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:42.160
you get funding. Intuit developer

00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:54.860
N T U I t.me/code.
It seems like there's all.

268
00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:59.440
So a, a use for
AI here. If you were,

269
00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:01.930
you were mentioned before at
the very beginning, thinking about

270
00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:05.170
images right now on Twitter.
If I tweet an image

271
00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:07.810
right underneath the image, there's
a click that says add

272
00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:10.960
description. So it's basically making
the all tag a very

273
00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:16.030
natural thing to type, but,
you know, barring typing that

274
00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:18.880
myself manually. I think that
either now or in the

275
00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:21.010
future, we'll be able to
have AIS that can say,

276
00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:23.740
yeah, this is a picture
of a red lunchbox sitting

277
00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:27.160
on a table. And that
can be described even if

278
00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:31.360
a human didn't do it.
AI is the future of

279
00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:36.550
many accessibility features on YouTube.
Right now they have auto

280
00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:40.420
caption and it's not a
hundred percent accurate. In fact,

281
00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:43.330
it might be 85% accurate.
And if you're missing that

282
00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:47.380
one crucial word in 10,
it, it can be aggravating,

283
00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:51.510
but things are getting better.
Facebook has already started in

284
00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:58.290
implementing auto captions for photos.
And again, it's not perfect,

285
00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:00.810
but it's a lot better
than it was a few

286
00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:04.920
years ago. And the more
things go, the more data

287
00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:07.200
AI is going to have
to be able to, to

288
00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:10.590
Paris this information and make
it more usable for people

289
00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:14.640
with disabilities. So I definitely
think AI is going to

290
00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:17.730
have a huge part to
play in accessibility in future.

291
00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:21.650
Now you are, you are
physically disabled, you're in a

292
00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:25.220
wheelchair. Does that affect your
browsing? Mm, No. It has

293
00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:28.760
no direct effect on my
browsing as a wheelchair user.

294
00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:32.300
I do have a bit
of arthritis in my hands,

295
00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:36.380
so that can sometimes impact
my, my ability to use

296
00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:40.820
a mouse. And two years
ago, I, I was very

297
00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:43.370
silly and I ended up
breaking both my wrists. So

298
00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:46.160
instead of being able to
type 80 words per minute,

299
00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:51.020
I was stuck with a
very uncomfortable type with two

300
00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:53.540
fingers kind of situation. So
I ended up having to

301
00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:57.920
use assistive technology like dragon
dictate to, to interact with

302
00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:03.020
my computer. So that, that
was interesting because as a

303
00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:06.860
wheelchair user, I had one
view of accessibility, but suddenly

304
00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:11.090
becoming more or differently to
say bold in another range,

305
00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:15.710
I had to readapt myself
to, to interacting with my

306
00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:20.780
technology. That must have been
like emotionally, a very strange

307
00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:24.860
feeling because you have one
disability, you feel like you're

308
00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:28.610
as empathetic as one could
be. You understand disability, you're

309
00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:31.700
dealing with ramps all day,
then you break your wrists

310
00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:34.250
and then you're like, Oh
crap, is this what it's

311
00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:36.830
like for people with quote
unquote with a, with a

312
00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:39.260
disability like that? Is it
affecting their day to day

313
00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:42.710
work in such a fundamental
way? Like suddenly my brain

314
00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:45.680
can't get the keys, get
the information into the computer

315
00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:47.660
as fast as before. Did
that, was that a shock

316
00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:52.490
to the system? It was
not a shock in that

317
00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:57.350
way. The shock for me,
it was really this discovery

318
00:19:57.350 --> 00:20:00.470
that the assistive technology you
really have to learn and

319
00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:04.790
there's learning curves. And, you
know, for example, I was

320
00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:08.750
using dragon dictate, which is
a really powerful piece of

321
00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:14.090
software that works best on
windows in English. I am

322
00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:16.310
a Mac user, so I
was trained to use it

323
00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:20.600
on the Mac and that
was complicated. And I could

324
00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:23.150
not use the French version
of it on a Mac

325
00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:27.470
at all, because that's just
really not friendly. So basically

326
00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:31.250
I discovered that the best
piece of assistive technology forced

327
00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:35.720
me into using a different
platform altogether, if I want

328
00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:40.640
it to be performance. So
there's, there's this realization that

329
00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:44.390
for example, someone who's blind
who may have been using

330
00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:49.990
jars and a screen reader
called for 15 years may

331
00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:53.140
not have an option to
actually switch to a different

332
00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:57.220
browser or a different platform
because their assistive technology works

333
00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:01.180
best is optimized best for
certain browser on a certain

334
00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:05.370
platform. Hmm. Yeah. You had
mentioned that there, there, there

335
00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:08.670
is combinations that are, they're
not official, but they are

336
00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:12.150
kind of like the defacto
combination of this browser on

337
00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:15.030
this platform. And this language
is going to give someone

338
00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:18.330
with a certain disability, the
most success. And if they

339
00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:21.060
change one piece of that,
they're going to bump into

340
00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:24.930
issues all the time. Yeah.
Yeah. That is frustrating. I'm

341
00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:28.860
looking at this list of
success criteria, the ones that

342
00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:34.770
are new to the, the
WC AIG orientation is an

343
00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:37.080
interesting one because I realized
that 10 years ago, we

344
00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:42.000
weren't necessarily thinking about, you
know, portrait versus landscape. Yeah.

345
00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:45.520
Do you know why orientation
is so important? I think

346
00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:47.760
for me, it's when I'm
in bed, I want Netflix

347
00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:49.290
to be one way and
I've got my head the

348
00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:53.220
other way, but I honestly
don't know. Yeah. A lot

349
00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:58.410
of people that have mobility
and impairments, whether they're quadriplegic

350
00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:02.520
or have Cyril policy or
something like that will actually

351
00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:05.280
Mount their device, whether it's
a phone or an iPad

352
00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:10.050
on their wheelchair and they
can't actually change the orientation

353
00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:14.730
of their device easily. So
if your site is coded

354
00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:17.910
that it's only gonna work
on portrait or only going

355
00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:22.740
to work in landscape, suddenly
these people may not have

356
00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:26.430
the ability to actually use
your, your interface. See, and

357
00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:29.910
this is the thing about
accessibility. I think that people

358
00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:32.610
who do not have any
major disabilities need to think

359
00:22:32.610 --> 00:22:36.450
about is you might not
be able to even consider,

360
00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:38.430
like, why would that matter?
And then once you learn,

361
00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:42.390
you're like, Oh, Oh, of
course. Yeah. Yeah. Every one

362
00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:45.210
of these success criteria and
every one of these accessibility

363
00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:48.180
things, once you get it,
you immediately go, of course,

364
00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:51.840
absolutely. This is important. This
is important. That's right. Yeah.

365
00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:55.080
That's amazing. So these success
criteria, there's a bunch of

366
00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:56.850
them as like, you know,
a dozen and a half

367
00:22:56.850 --> 00:23:00.630
that are being added. Many
of them are like we

368
00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:05.220
said, refinements, but also new
things where orientation came up

369
00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:11.370
and then also like motion.
Actuations another interesting one. There

370
00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:14.100
are, I have applications on
my, on my iPhone that

371
00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:17.040
require you to do Shake
the phone. Yeah. That seems

372
00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:19.140
to be a new thing.
Shake the phone for feedback.

373
00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:22.650
Not everybody can do that.
That's good. Someone else might

374
00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:26.100
be shaking all the time
because of their disabilities. Are

375
00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:28.740
they sending feedback constantly? They're
not. So you need to

376
00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:30.480
real to think about that
when you go and just

377
00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:34.650
Throw in a feature like
shake for feedback. Yeah. That's

378
00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:38.700
a tough one. So these
success criteria you said are

379
00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:43.800
for both the browser manufacturers
and for the Developers, is

380
00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:46.460
there a tool that I
can run? Is there one

381
00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:48.230
tool that I can run
on? Like for example, my

382
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:51.170
podcast site, that's going to
tell me that I'm okay.

383
00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:55.040
Or will I never be
100% accessible? The first thing

384
00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:59.480
to realize is that accessibility
is not a checklist. And

385
00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:02.660
the 12, we have all
these success criteria. It's very

386
00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:05.480
unlikely that all of them
will apply to your site

387
00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:09.920
or your app. The other
thing is that while there

388
00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:14.390
are accessibility testing tools out
there that runs a somewhat

389
00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:18.740
automatically, they're not going to
catch every problem out there.

390
00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:21.560
And some of these tools
will, will even say, Hey,

391
00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:26.820
actually you have to manually
review these items. So with,

392
00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:31.100
with that caveat, there's, there's
two tools that I think

393
00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:35.600
developers can, can really use
and rely on. One is

394
00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:41.330
called the ax accessibility plug
in S a X E

395
00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:46.250
is by DEQ DEQ, U
E. And it's available as

396
00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:50.780
a plugin for Chrome or
Firefox. And it's through the

397
00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:55.340
inspector tools and it will
actually scan your page and

398
00:24:55.370 --> 00:25:00.110
pick up potential accessibility issues.
The other one is more

399
00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:04.190
of an API driven system,
which is commercial. It's called

400
00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:10.340
tenon.io, T E N O
n.io. And that's a really

401
00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:13.490
powerful tool that will do
the same thing. It's going

402
00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:16.790
to scan your entire site.
If you want to have

403
00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:19.610
the entire site scanned. And
it's going to give potential

404
00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:24.530
issues. These automated testing tool
at the moment are on

405
00:25:24.650 --> 00:25:30.170
testing against WCAG 2.0 because
it's, it's not quite yet

406
00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:33.530
a guideline that is ready
for prime time. The 2.1.

407
00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:36.800
However, that said, if you're
quoting, you really want to

408
00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:39.650
future proof your, your site
and your application. So you

409
00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:45.710
should look at using 2.1.
Mm. So yeah, automated tools

410
00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:49.190
are great to get a
feel for what's going on

411
00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:52.010
on a page or a
site to get a pulse

412
00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:55.550
as to what's happening and
to get an idea. But

413
00:25:55.580 --> 00:26:00.260
there's nothing that's going to
be manual assessment by, by

414
00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:04.190
someone who's actually used to
do that. And then the

415
00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:08.510
ultimate is to actually do
user testing, what people who

416
00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:12.830
are actually people with disabilities.
So, you know, I've been

417
00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:18.710
doing WebEx disability for 23
years now. And when I

418
00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:23.180
do an audit, invariably, there's
always one person that uses

419
00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:25.790
the web in a way
that I didn't expect or

420
00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:30.320
will because of their combination
of existing technology. We'll find

421
00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:34.280
stuff that isn't quite what
I expected. So user testing

422
00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:37.820
with real people with disabilities
is definitely something you should

423
00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:40.820
do at the end of
the process. How far can

424
00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:43.230
we take it though? We
want to include everyone. But,

425
00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:45.960
you know, as They say
on the internet long tail,

426
00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:50.550
as long a you can
hit 80%, 90%, 99%. Everyone

427
00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:53.880
has different abilities. We, we,
we talked about all the

428
00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:58.500
different abilities and disabilities that
we haven't thought about. That

429
00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:02.190
one, you know, it's, it's
not my disability until it's,

430
00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:05.340
you know, it is, if
I bring in blind people

431
00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:08.220
for testing, deaf people protesting,
et cetera, will I ever

432
00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:10.170
be finished? You said, it's
not a checklist, but when

433
00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:13.340
do I know when to
stop? Yeah. You know, there's,

434
00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:16.700
there's always edge cases. And
one of the things that

435
00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:19.790
I've heard over and over
the last two decades of

436
00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:23.390
doing a sustainability is, but
Nick, I can't code for

437
00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:26.420
the person who's deaf, blind
and paralyzed from neck down.

438
00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:30.290
And of course that that's,
you know, a rare situation.

439
00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:34.970
What I tell people is
code to the standard, make

440
00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:39.950
sure that things are meeting
WCAB level, double a, as

441
00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:43.640
much as possible and throw
in as many success criteria

442
00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:46.430
from level AAA as you
can, and you're going to

443
00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:49.010
be doing good. And then
if you have someone who

444
00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:51.200
comes to you and say,
Hey, I can't use your

445
00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:56.120
side because XYZ, then you
can look at how you

446
00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:59.090
can implement that. But bottom
line is you want to

447
00:27:59.090 --> 00:28:02.870
put in maybe 20% of
your effort to get 80%

448
00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:05.870
of the way to accessibility,
get those low hanging fruits

449
00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:10.490
that are actually typically fairly
easy to meet. If you

450
00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:14.420
follow the guidelines and you'll
beat in goods. Hmm. That's

451
00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:17.390
a good point. It's also
worth pointing out that it's,

452
00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:20.900
it needs to be more
than just a casual Googling

453
00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:24.230
for accessibility checker running and
pushing a button that says

454
00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:26.630
check it. Like I just
went to a random place

455
00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:29.570
and I typed in hanselminutes.com
and it says no known

456
00:28:29.570 --> 00:28:32.450
problems. Okay. Yeah. I could
go and say, I'm good.

457
00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:34.580
But then I also went
and looked at the ax

458
00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:36.800
tool that you pointed me
to, and it gave me

459
00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:41.030
41 violations with 86 needs
review. And then I went

460
00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:43.790
to tenon, which is a
different tool by a different

461
00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:46.370
company. And it said there
were four issues. So here's

462
00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:49.040
three different tools that I've
used. One says, four, one

463
00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:52.880
says nearly 86, but 41
are definite violations. And one

464
00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:57.230
said, none. So depending on
who you ask, I either

465
00:28:57.230 --> 00:28:59.420
have no work to do
or weeks of work to

466
00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:01.880
do. So I need to
put some thought into that.

467
00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:04.550
Yeah. I think it's a
fair assumption that if you

468
00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:08.420
have a tool that says
you have no accessibility issue,

469
00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:12.590
you can completely forget that
tool because unless you have

470
00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:14.570
done a lot of work
to make sure that there

471
00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:18.110
are no accessibility issues, there
will be, there will be

472
00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:21.830
issues, but, you know, comparing
X to 10 and they

473
00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:24.980
have different rules, they check
for different things and different

474
00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:28.550
levels of being strict. So
you have to do a

475
00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:31.340
bit of a balancing act,
but you know, if you

476
00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:35.990
have questions, go on Twitter
and use the hashtag <inaudible>

477
00:29:36.050 --> 00:29:40.370
and ask away, or there's
a, there's an accessibility Slack

478
00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:43.330
channel that you use where
people are very happy to

479
00:29:43.330 --> 00:29:49.140
share knowledge. So when in
doubt, ask the experts. So

480
00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:54.000
accessibility is often a reverberated
as the, not an acronym,

481
00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.970
but a numerous him. Yup.
A 11. Why we're the

482
00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.030
number 11 is the number
of letters omitted. And that

483
00:30:00.030 --> 00:30:02.760
is also the one of
the titles of your podcast.

484
00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:07.070
It's a 11, why rules.com?
You've been doing this for

485
00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:10.380
a while now with conversations
around web accessibility, with a

486
00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:15.360
lot of different guests, both
abled and disabled. Yes. It's

487
00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:19.440
been fantastic. I wanted, you
know, I've been doing accessibility

488
00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:22.860
for so long and met
so many people. And suddenly

489
00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:25.770
I realized, I don't know
these people, I don't know

490
00:30:25.770 --> 00:30:28.860
what they really think. We,
we share technical tidbits and

491
00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:30.810
all that, but I want
to get to know these

492
00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:35.100
people better. And then I
thought, well, surely I'm not

493
00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:37.650
the only one in the
community that wants to do

494
00:30:37.650 --> 00:30:41.820
that. So I thought let's
do a podcast. And suddenly

495
00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:44.940
it's, it's been really interesting
because I speak to a

496
00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:48.750
wide range of people and
I pretty much ask the

497
00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:52.590
same basic questions. And from
there, the conversations really expands

498
00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:57.030
into weird and wonderful and
fantastic areas where I'm getting

499
00:30:57.030 --> 00:31:01.110
to think about my own
area of expertise differently. And

500
00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:07.080
I've had something like 23,
24 guests. So far, I

501
00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:11.190
always ask, how do you
define accessibility? And the out

502
00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:16.740
of 23 guests, 24 guests,
I've had 24 different answers.

503
00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:20.430
It all revolves around the
same thing, but everybody has

504
00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:24.270
a little bit of a
closer definition or something that

505
00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:27.450
they really care about that
they want to, to involve

506
00:31:27.450 --> 00:31:31.020
in that. So it's really
kind of fascinating just briefly.

507
00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:34.380
I have also a enough
shoot of that. The accessibility

508
00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:38.370
rules, some bites where I
do short segments, five to

509
00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:41.760
10 minutes with people with
disabilities, where I ask them,

510
00:31:41.850 --> 00:31:45.420
you know, what's your impairment,
what's your barrier? And what

511
00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:48.210
do you want designers and
developers to know? So that,

512
00:31:48.270 --> 00:31:51.480
that's a good way to,
to hear it in their

513
00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:55.440
own words as to why
these things are important. It

514
00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:57.330
was actually a very clever
way to, to make a

515
00:31:57.330 --> 00:32:00.600
30 or 40 minute long
podcast, also accessible to people

516
00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:03.510
who maybe don't have the
time or the patience. You

517
00:32:03.510 --> 00:32:06.960
can go to a 11,
why rules.com right at the

518
00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:10.170
top there, click on soundbites.
You get five minutes on,

519
00:32:10.170 --> 00:32:13.110
you know, how does ADHD
affect a web person? How

520
00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:16.230
does a screen reader work?
What does speech recognition or

521
00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:20.400
colorblindness? That's a very clever
way to make your podcast

522
00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:22.800
even more accessible. Thank you.
Well, thanks so much for

523
00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:25.650

been a pleasure. Thanks for
