00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:39.440
In this episode, Scott discusses
open source. Hi, this is

18
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.620
Carl Franklin. You're listening to Hansel
minutes. I'm here with Scott

19
00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.400
Hanselman as I am every
week. Hi Scott, How are

20
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.820
you, sir? We're talking about
open source this week. We

21
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.330
are, that's a big topic,
isn't it? It is big

22
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.360
topic for a little podcast
is open source a crap

23
00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.870
idea. This is a blog
post that you wrote. Yeah,

24
00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.260
this was from a little
while back. I just wanted

25
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:04.850
to throw it out there
and see what people thought.

26
00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.590
This is from March. And
it was about an article

27
00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.260
in the economist on open
source. And it had an

28
00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.170
interesting graph that I thought
was worth noting that was

29
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.460
referencing the Apache community and
the number of people having

30
00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.870
discussions about open source software
projects versus the number of

31
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.140
people actually writing code. And
of course the graph that

32
00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.020
shows the number of people,
holding discussions and number of

33
00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.810
people talking was nice, you
know, Y equals X sharp

34
00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.960
45 degree angle. And the
number of code writers was

35
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.180
tiny, tiny, tiny, you know,
the number of people actually

36
00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.110
doing work in open source
versus talking about it is

37
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.810
a pretty dramatic ratio Seems
to be more like a

38
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.570
philosophical topic, right? For most
people. Yeah. And everyone wants

39
00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.140
to use free software, right.
Everyone is consistently amazed. If

40
00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.030
you download a copy of
who Boone to Linux and

41
00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.910
you go, Holy crap, this
is amazing. Or just any

42
00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.030
really good free Software. Oh
yeah. But do you really

43
00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.920
think that it's, that is
free, right? I mean, keep

44
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.380
in mind that people are
starting foundations in order to

45
00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.240
make this happen. Right. I
mean, the guy that started

46
00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.210
who Boone, who is a
billionaire for a reason, it's

47
00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.310
not just people in their
garage, in their spare time

48
00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.770
for the really big, awesome,
amazing stuff. Right. So I

49
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:19.110
was just going to kind
of wanted to talk about

50
00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.410
that and explore the idea
that what does it mean

51
00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.630
to be free, right. There's
a lot of really interesting

52
00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.200
discussions about that. Particularly a
good one at a <inaudible>

53
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.670
dot org, shrink stir slash
<inaudible> the philosophy of free

54
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.360
software, the discussion of what,
what does free mean? Right.

55
00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.380
Are we talking about free?
Like, like <inaudible> like it's

56
00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.680
free, complete them in <inaudible>
or are we talking about

57
00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.560
free as in Libra, as
in, to be free to

58
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.830
be released, to be, you
know, free as in speech

59
00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.270
or free as in beer,
right? The free software definition,

60
00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.390
the free software foundation says
that free software is a

61
00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.070
matter of Liberty, not price,
so free speech versus free

62
00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:03.810
beer. And it says here,
and it's in the definition,

63
00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.520
I'll just read part of
the definition that the freedom

64
00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.520
to run the program, the
freedom to study the program,

65
00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.370
the freedom to redistribute the
copies so you can help

66
00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.400
your neighbor and the freedom
to improve it. I think

67
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.550
that's a really great definition
of free software. When I

68
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:20.100
think about the open source
projects that I'm involved in,

69
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.890
like, like DAS blog, those
are all the great things

70
00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.350
that, that I would like
to us blog to be

71
00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.580
able to do. Hmm. Now
w what are your opinions

72
00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.190
about, I mean, I think
you're forming them here, but

73
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.570
what are your opinions about
open source? I mean, you're

74
00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.390
a, you're an ass peanut
guy, you know, you're a

75
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:40.800
Microsoft software guy. You make
your living using Microsoft software,

76
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.220
which is not open source.
And yet you love to

77
00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.890
play around with Linux and,
you know, you've been doing

78
00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:50.670
that for a long time.
That's a good question. I

79
00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.890
don't think that opensource is
necessarily a Lennox thing, right?

80
00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:56.400
I mean, yes, Microsoft itself
and their software is close,

81
00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.300
closed source, but didn't you
think that when, when we

82
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.280
got into the.net world, something
changed, there was a, a

83
00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.530
community, a sense of community
around.net. Lots of dotnet code

84
00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.170
was released. There was a
sense of sharing, Not only

85
00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:13.500
that Scott, but the sense
of do we really need

86
00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.130
the source code when we
have tools like reflector and

87
00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.980
we have inheritance and we,
you know, do we want

88
00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:23.250
or need the source code?
Yeah, that's a good point.

89
00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.500
I mean, without an outfit
skater, it's pretty, you know,

90
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.130
the programmer's intent is pretty
much there. So suddenly all

91
00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.920
of the different kind of
what I call horizontal things,

92
00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.200
you know, things that aren't
specific or vertical to your

93
00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.650
business, all the horizontal things
became commoditized. No, one's gonna

94
00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.860
make a bajillion dollars on
a, a, a new kind

95
00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:45.540
of text box or a
JPEG decoder, but, you know,

96
00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:48.510
they might do something amazing
with that with a JPEG,

97
00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.790
once they've got a Dakota
doing some kind of analysis

98
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.220
on it. So the kinds
of things you'd want to

99
00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.680
be free, or that, that
horizontal part, that base of

100
00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.550
the pyramid that you build
your big giant thing on

101
00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.780
the operating system. Yeah. Operating
system, big applications, suites of

102
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.290
applications. But is it really
like, for example, here, let's

103
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:09.320
look at Kirlian, right? Kirlian
makes online banking software. That's

104
00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.530
the company that I'm the
chief architect at and something

105
00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:15.890
like 25% of the retail
bank banking people in the

106
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:19.070
U S use Kirlian. We
use opensource software. That doesn't

107
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.470
mean that Kirlian is built
on open source software. That

108
00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:24.770
means that there are pieces
of things within the chromium

109
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:28.730
platform that's built on Microsoft
that is open source because

110
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:31.520
is it really curly job
to write the next greatest

111
00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:35.000
logger or, you know, Kirlian
need to be building a

112
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.970
test framework? You know, we
do finance, we do online

113
00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:41.720
retail, you finance that has
nothing to do with logging.

114
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.020
So Microsoft didn't have a
logger, someone else out there

115
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.000
made an awesome one. So
then we looked at log

116
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.790
for net, which actually gets
into an interesting discussion about

117
00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:52.310
how do you incorporate open
source into your, into your

118
00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:55.930
life. And licensing is the
topic of that, right. And

119
00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:01.300
licensing. Yeah, absolutely. There's a
number of interesting links on

120
00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:08.950
licensing shrink stir slash H
seven D up@theopensource.org site has

121
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:12.940
a whole list of licenses,
all the different kinds. It's

122
00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:16.090
more than just the, the
canoe public, the general, the

123
00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:19.570
GPL, the general public license.
There's also the very popular,

124
00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:26.170
you know, BSD license, Berkeley
license. There's gosh, what do

125
00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:28.300
we have that there's piles
and piles of licenses here

126
00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:29.740
that you can pick? The
one that you like, the

127
00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:35.770
Apache license Sockets originally BSD
sockets itself, Berkeley software, the

128
00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:38.680
guys at Burton, or the
Berkeley software, that, that name

129
00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.410
comes up all the time.
Whether it be that, you

130
00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:43.450
know, in the first, in
the context of the, of

131
00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:46.150
sockets. So you used to
say Berkeley Rockets, right. And

132
00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:49.090
when sock was based on
that, There is, there used

133
00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:51.640
to be a thing underneath
the, the stack and Unix

134
00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.860
that people would say, well,
this is the spur Berkeley

135
00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:58.150
socket to the BSD socket
API. This was an API

136
00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:02.380
in Unix in 1980, 83,
84. And it was the

137
00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:06.730
standard for sockets. And I
don't know where it came

138
00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:08.980
from. I'm sure the Wikipedia
would let, let me know,

139
00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:13.300
but that socket interface became
a standard thing. And then

140
00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:18.460
the Berkeley software license is
different. Okay. Just give us

141
00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:23.560
an idea of the main
differences between say BSD and

142
00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.980
GPL, because I've heard Microsoft
say that they're not anti

143
00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:30.880
open source, but they're anti
GPL. Yeah, exactly. So GPL

144
00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.130
is what if I understand
correctly here, and it'd be

145
00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:35.170
very interesting to have a
conversation with people who listen

146
00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:38.320
that the GPL is what
they call viral in the

147
00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:41.050
sense that when, when the,
when the GPL, when the

148
00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:43.660
new public license is attached
to something that you write,

149
00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:45.760
let's say, I write it.
Let's say I write a

150
00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:48.460
logger. Well, that's not a,
probably not a very good

151
00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:50.230
example, but if I write
a piece of software and

152
00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:53.740
then I extend it in
some way, it is important

153
00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:57.030
for me to release the
source for my extension. Yes.

154
00:08:57.130 --> 00:08:59.340
A really good example of
this. Actually, here's a great

155
00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:03.300
example. The guys at Sophia
soft wrote a, we talked

156
00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:04.890
about them on our links
to show, right? When we

157
00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:07.620
talked about extending the links
as router, right? They took

158
00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:11.430
some, some open source GPL
software and extended it, but

159
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:13.290
they put a great deal
of money into it. And

160
00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:16.350
they extended it in a
very large way. And there

161
00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:19.800
was an argument amongst them
and a large number of

162
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:22.590
the members of the community
that they had not released

163
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:27.300
that software in a very
forthcoming way. So people said,

164
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.820
well, they have, they have
broken the rules of the,

165
00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:32.340
of the GPL license. And
we demand that they release

166
00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:35.100
that software. And then it
became this big pissing contest.

167
00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:38.100
Well, they would, people would
host copies of their source.

168
00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:40.380
And then, you know, so
then the question became, what

169
00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:42.780
is it that those guys
did, you know, where, what

170
00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:44.580
did, what did they add?
What is the benefit that

171
00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:47.490
they added and what do
they own versus what should

172
00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:50.880
be released back to the,
to the outside world? Right?

173
00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:55.140
So, so for people to
do it in the correct

174
00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:57.420
way, the, the, the really
classy way, I think a

175
00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:00.540
good example is what Joel
Spolsky did he, you know,

176
00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:03.630
Joel Spolsky at Joel on
software wrote a thing called

177
00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:07.860
the fog Creek copilot it's
basically, they took VNC, right?

178
00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:12.060
VNC is a GPL, a
remote desktop kind of a

179
00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:15.450
thing. And they wrote a
new really neat tool where

180
00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:19.200
you can go into copilot.com.
You pay him like 10

181
00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.960
bucks. And then for 24
hours, you can connect to

182
00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:24.600
remote machines and help your
mom and do things like

183
00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:27.870
that. What's different from it
versus then, you know, the

184
00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:30.570
value added with what's different
between it and the remote

185
00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:34.080
desktop stuff that's built into
windows is that copilot goes

186
00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:38.100
through firewalls. So they basically
wrote a Nat traversal, a

187
00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:44.670
network address, translation, traversal technique
for VNC by extending tight

188
00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:47.730
VNC. So if you go
up to copilot.com and then

189
00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:49.500
you click on their FAC
and you go to the

190
00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:53.370
bottom, it says, how do
I obtain the source code?

191
00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:56.010
Right. They build a whole
business model around this. They

192
00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:57.510
built, they put a lot
of work into it. They

193
00:10:57.510 --> 00:11:00.000
had four interns working for
a summer on this thing,

194
00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:03.420
but at the bottom, they
said, Hey, here's a copy.

195
00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:06.030
You can click. They've got
a zip file, all prepared.

196
00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:07.860
They only make it click
in two places and then

197
00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:10.530
boom, the sources there. So
then the question is, well,

198
00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:12.510
how would they make any
money while they make it

199
00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:14.820
by charging people to use
the service, which is what

200
00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:18.330
you've said exactly. It's the
service, it's the key exchange.

201
00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:20.130
I mean, you can go
and see their source. They

202
00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:22.680
released it to the world.
They put a great deal

203
00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:25.080
of work and value into
it. But the business model

204
00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:29.610
isn't truly and completely dependent
on the source. So some

205
00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:32.700
people they'll feel much more
strongly that their sources really

206
00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:34.500
the, the big intellectual property.
So they'll get into a

207
00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:38.010
trap or they'll start up
working on something on, on

208
00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:41.250
open source, a GPL, licensed
software, they extend it. They

209
00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:45.120
go, wow, I really added
some value. That's not something

210
00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.010
I want to give out
to the world. And then

211
00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:50.370
that's where you get into
the trouble. And the BSD

212
00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:54.310
license is different. I believe
the BSD license is a

213
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:59.320
lot more relaxed. The canoe
license is like 3000 words.

214
00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:04.100
And the BSD license is
like 300 words. So the,

215
00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:08.080
the, the, the BSD licenses,
basically this has no warranty.

216
00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:11.320
It's pretty much as is.
There's no way we're going

217
00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:14.140
to be liable for anything.
And go ahead and do

218
00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:17.370
your thing, enjoy yourself. And
don't bother us. And you

219
00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:23.520
don't have to rerelease changes
and modifications. People believe that

220
00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:26.820
the BSD license is more
free than the GPL because

221
00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:28.770
the BSD says they can
do anything they want to.

222
00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:33.810
Okay. I mean, BSD is
darn near public domain. What

223
00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:40.230
is the whole free as
in beer thing? Welcome. Yeah.

224
00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:44.910
So if you go to
a shrink stir slash <inaudible>

225
00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:48.750
up at the, up at
the ward, Cunningham, Portland pattern,

226
00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:53.280
repository free as in beer
is the idea of, you

227
00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.020
know, you go to a
party and there's free beer,

228
00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:57.660
that's it. You pick it
up, you drink it. You're

229
00:12:57.660 --> 00:12:59.220
cool. You don't have to
pay for it. You don't

230
00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:01.230
have to think about it.
And it doesn't, it has

231
00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:07.710
no maintenance, right? So free
software people always say, well,

232
00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:10.650
how free is this? Is
it truly free? And do

233
00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:12.870
anything I want to with
it? Or is it more

234
00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:16.010
kind of free as in
speech? So that, that, that

235
00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:18.390
differentiation between frees and beach
that we talked about before

236
00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:22.140
Libra versus grantees, what It
strikes me right off the

237
00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:25.260
bat about this is that,
you know, everything is free

238
00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.990
as in speech, because speech
is free under the law.

239
00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:30.240
You know, you ha you
have the right to use

240
00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:34.380
software. You have the right
to buy software, whether it's

241
00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:36.870
free or not, you have
the right to use it,

242
00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:41.640
don't you? Well, so you're
the right to use it.

243
00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:43.890
But the trick is, is
the source code available to

244
00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:48.480
the users. And can you
redistribute the source code? Right?

245
00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:52.740
So free software is anything
that you can run, study

246
00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:57.150
redistribute or improve right now,
when you add something like,

247
00:13:57.210 --> 00:14:00.420
like a canoe, you're taking
all of those things, and

248
00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:03.600
then you're adding the source
code, absolutely must be available

249
00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.760
to the users, right? You
cannot use this. You cannot

250
00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:08.640
give the software away without
giving the source away as

251
00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:12.570
well. Right? And here's the
trick and you cannot sell

252
00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:15.990
it. You cannot redistribute it
under a different license, right?

253
00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:19.560
And that's where you get
trouble. And we've seen, and

254
00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:21.480
this is why we distribute.
This is why Clemons rather

255
00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:25.170
made the decision to distribute
Dodge blog under BSD, Nutella,

256
00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:28.530
the company that Clemens masters
work for when they started

257
00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:31.050
the DAS blog project under
the guise of Nutella, essence

258
00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:35.070
corporation said, we reserve the
right as new Teligent to

259
00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:37.380
take this, improve it, not
release the source and make

260
00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:41.250
money on it. And you
can too. So we, you

261
00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:43.440
know, we've had companies say,
well, we're interested in extending

262
00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:45.120
dash blog and making money
on it. And we say,

263
00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:48.450
that's cool and good for
you. We wish you would

264
00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:51.980
give the source out, but
it's not a viral. We're

265
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:56.330
not going to take your,
your improvements and force you

266
00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:59.390
to return it. Okay. So
what open source software do

267
00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:01.730
you use? I mean, we
use log for net Nant

268
00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:05.710
and unit and cover. I
use VNC. I use that

269
00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:07.210
quite a bit. In fact,
we're using it right now

270
00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:10.240
in our class, the Miguel
Castro's here teaching. We have

271
00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:13.690
three people in the classroom
and three people remotely. So

272
00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:17.440
in the remotes use VNC
to watch his screen Slick.

273
00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:20.320
Now, have you, have you
personally given any source code

274
00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:23.410
back to an open source
project? Have you catched something?

275
00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:25.930
Nope. Is that because you
haven't found a bug or

276
00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:27.550
it's just because It's just
because it's not what I

277
00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:31.990
do, you know? Yeah. They
were asking the wrong guy.

278
00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:36.070
No, that's cool. So there
was a big discussion between

279
00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:41.590
myself, Phil hack, Jeff Atwood
about, you know, is open

280
00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:45.760
source free, like a flower.
Phil said it was free,

281
00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:50.230
like a flower shrink stir
slash H seven, six, basically.

282
00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:52.180
You know, you get to,
to look at it and

283
00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:55.570
smell it and enjoy it.
And they go, it's all

284
00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:59.830
about, you know, love and
apparently flowers. I don't particularly

285
00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:01.840
think that's a very good
analogy. I said that it

286
00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:04.300
was free like a puppy,
because it requires care and

287
00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:06.610
feeding. You have no guarantee
when you get an open

288
00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:10.260
source piece of software that
it may disappear, but the

289
00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:12.190
guys that are writing it,
you know, we just saw

290
00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:15.280
with the, the end doc,
lot of confusion about this

291
00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:18.370
end doc thing, and doc
goes away. We also, this

292
00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:20.230
is the thing, though. It
went away in the sense

293
00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:22.450
that the, the gentleman who
was working on it has

294
00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:25.330
decided to no longer work
on it, but there's still

295
00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:29.860
a large team. Right. There's
still a fork. This is

296
00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:31.750
another thing that happens with
opensource software is when it

297
00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:35.680
forks. Right. So end dock
was on 1.3, somewhere out

298
00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:38.350
there as a Mendota 2.0
code, but 1.3 has been

299
00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:42.010
improved and they've got it
working on a dotnet two.

300
00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:45.280
Oh. And then you've got
things like sand castle when

301
00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:48.670
Microsoft comes out of nowhere
with their, you know, blank

302
00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:53.290
killer. So for Nant it
was ms. Build. And for

303
00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:55.990
end docket appears to be
sand castle, which is the

304
00:16:55.990 --> 00:17:00.460
new document builder from, from
Microsoft. Right. So I said

305
00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:03.430
that it was a free,
like a, a free, like

306
00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:09.700
a puppy. And then Jeff
Atwood from coding horror at

307
00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:14.860
shrink slash H 77, he
said, if open source software

308
00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:17.710
required as much effort as
raising a puppy, your local

309
00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:20.170
pound would be even more
full than it already is.

310
00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:25.600
So I was basically saying,
I think we as developers,

311
00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:27.490
I mean, think about this,
just the fact that we're

312
00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:30.370
listening to this podcast or
we're blogging, or we're even

313
00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:33.700
reading blogs means that the
group of developers that we

314
00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:36.220
are kind of, we are
our, you know, our peer

315
00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:39.670
group, you, me, the people
listening, the people who blog

316
00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:42.700
are already at a, a
national honor or an upper

317
00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:45.550
level of, of developer in
consciousness in the sense that

318
00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:49.000
they are thoughtful, interested in
improving themselves and becoming better,

319
00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:53.610
they're already at a level
of quality or at least

320
00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:56.250
that they are trying to
improve themselves while so few.

321
00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:58.950
And when, so few do,
right, there's the, what I

322
00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:01.320
call five Oh one developers,
you know, it's like, Hey,

323
00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:04.710
it's five Oh one, can
I punch out? Yep. So

324
00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:07.710
I was proposing that it
is important for us to

325
00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:09.870
give back to the community.
And I think that the

326
00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:11.490
best thing that you can
do to give back to

327
00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:15.030
the community is fixing bugs,
fixing bugs. I did a

328
00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:17.400
little article on how to
contribute a patch to an

329
00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:20.580
open source project without being
the administrator at shrinks or

330
00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:25.920
slash H seven, five. And
a lot of really interesting

331
00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:29.970
discussion came up around it
because Jeff believes the whole

332
00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:32.340
point is to save us
time just to keep us

333
00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:36.090
from rewriting software. So for
him open source equals reuse.

334
00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:40.110
Right? Well, you know, for
me, open source is more

335
00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:42.510
of a gift. And I
don't think it's a good

336
00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:44.670
idea to just take that
gift and not give something

337
00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:47.640
back. So I think that
if it were easy, if

338
00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:50.700
it were just incredibly easy
to contribute a patch to

339
00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:53.340
an open source piece of
software that would make life

340
00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:57.240
a lot, a lot easier.
I think that often I'll

341
00:18:57.330 --> 00:18:59.400
download a piece of software,
maybe a bug will happen,

342
00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:01.380
and then I'll see like
a call stack. It'll even

343
00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:03.300
show me the line number
and I'll dig into it

344
00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:06.360
for five minutes and I'll
go, Oh, wow, he's messing

345
00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:08.820
with a Knoll there. You
know, if there was a

346
00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:10.800
button to push or a
way to fix it, or

347
00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:13.410
let him know that this
is something that is easily

348
00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:16.350
fixed. That's great. It's amazing
to me how people will

349
00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:19.680
file bug reports with detailed
information about exactly what went

350
00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:24.030
wrong, complete reproduction instructions, but
they won't bother to fix

351
00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:27.660
it. Now, the argument is
by by Jeff and some

352
00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:34.020
of the detractors is that
that's unrealistic that the, the

353
00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:37.140
amount of time it would
take to learn that particular

354
00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:39.710
piece of software to poke
around and, and to, to

355
00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:42.600
figure out how it fits
in with the other pieces.

356
00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:44.820
It's just unreasonable to expect
someone to jump in on

357
00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:47.490
us, a piece of software
like that. Right. I can

358
00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:49.980
see that point of view,
but I don't think that

359
00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:52.470
that's a blanket point of
view. There are times when

360
00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:54.870
you can find something obvious
and fix something obvious. And

361
00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:57.500
that's a really great way
to give back. I have

362
00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:01.010
a question for you, Scott.
I'm sure there are lots

363
00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:03.770
of listeners of Hanselman it's
dot net rocks, whatever people

364
00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:08.690
that follow our shows. And,
and they, they have little

365
00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:12.650
pet projects that they've started,
maybe their components, maybe their

366
00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:17.690
utilities, you know, software, but
like most of the software

367
00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:19.970
that we write and mess
around with, it just goes

368
00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:24.230
in an hierarchy and in
our disc somewhere archived forever.

369
00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:28.610
What advantage, if any, would
we have in taking those

370
00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:31.040
pieces of software in whatever
state they're currently in which

371
00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:34.490
might not be completely working
and release them under a

372
00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:37.490
public domain license, put up
a site and say, all

373
00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:40.340
right, have at it, anybody
want to jump on here

374
00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:44.840
and take over? There you
go. No, that's a really

375
00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:47.650
great question. And then that
from, for me, there's, there

376
00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:50.890
is a hierarchy of open
source projects, right? Is this

377
00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:52.900
something that a group of
people are going to be

378
00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:55.450
excited about interested in enough
in that they're going to

379
00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:58.540
stick with it for awhile?
Is it a snippet, an

380
00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:02.500
applet, a technique, or is
it an application? You know,

381
00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:06.040
I think that places like
code project, while I've called

382
00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:11.500
code project.com a bathroom wall
of software before there, there

383
00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:15.130
are, it is a self
moderating place. You know, the

384
00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:17.890
cream rises to the top
there. If you go to

385
00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:20.710
code project and you find
a highly rated, highly thought

386
00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:26.800
of, you know, obviously maintained
article with a technique released

387
00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:28.960
as open source. I think
that, you know, lots of

388
00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:31.210
people out there might have
a chunk of code that

389
00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:34.360
they could put up there,
write a quick article. And

390
00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:36.610
if it's great, people will
discover it. And it'll, it'll

391
00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:39.570
rise to the top. I've
done this myself. I have

392
00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:42.420
a lot of little projects
that demonstrate how to do

393
00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:48.240
things the summer demos in
summer, actually full blown components

394
00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:52.350
that I've just released on
my Franklin net website with

395
00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:57.270
source code, without any, any
license whatsoever just here, take

396
00:21:57.270 --> 00:22:00.900
this, use it. And, you
know, I never even thought

397
00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:03.750
about if you have anything
to contribute back to it,

398
00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:06.600
you know, what do you
do? So, I mean, I

399
00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:08.940
guess that's where the whole
license thing is very helpful

400
00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:11.730
because, you know, I'm sure
somebody would like to modify

401
00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:14.310
it and they'd probably end
up emailing it back to

402
00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:15.780
me. So I could put
it up on the site

403
00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:18.780
again. But you know, there
isn't any formal structure around

404
00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:21.900
that. Is the, is there
a benefit to a developer

405
00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:23.700
to doing that? Or should
we just keep these things

406
00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:26.460
to ourselves? I guess? Well,
I think it's about size.

407
00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:29.160
I think if it's small,
you should put it up

408
00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:33.870
somewhere, like, like a forum,
like code project. If it

409
00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:38.100
is a, considering a pretty
good sized application, I think

410
00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:42.540
that somewhere like code Plex
or SourceForge or open QA

411
00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:45.090
or any of the many
open source hosting places you

412
00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:47.970
can put stuff at is
a good idea, except you

413
00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:49.410
don't want it to be
orphaned. Right? You want it

414
00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:54.240
to just disappear right. More
and more. I'm noticing groups

415
00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:57.570
of folks getting together and
little kind of mini consortium's

416
00:22:57.570 --> 00:23:02.850
and releasing tools, putting together
a formal tool site. Like

417
00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:05.460
you noticed that, you know,
Roy <inaudible> has been releasing

418
00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:07.980
tools for years. And then
recently just said, you know,

419
00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:11.130
I need a tools dot
<inaudible> dot com to put

420
00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:12.960
all this stuff at, you
know, maybe it's time for

421
00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:17.370
tools.franklin.com and then maybe it's
time for some kind of

422
00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:20.250
a search engine specific to
that kind of stuff, because

423
00:23:20.250 --> 00:23:23.400
these are your projects, but
they're not necessarily big enough

424
00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:25.890
Or popular enough. I mean,
you know, a lot of

425
00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:27.600
minor, a lot of the
ones that I have are

426
00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:30.330
components, you know, but I
have some really interesting things,

427
00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:35.430
like, for example, voiceover IP,
I've got a solution for

428
00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:39.270
that. I mean, I have
a voiceover IP solution that

429
00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:41.400
works pretty well, and I've
just been sitting on it,

430
00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:47.000
mini mini in one and
output I've that? Well, here's

431
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.400
an idea. There is, there
is a site pop culture.

432
00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:54.050
Here's another one. There is
a site called project distributor.net

433
00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:57.350
that Darren Nimkee has got
up there. It just, it

434
00:23:57.350 --> 00:24:00.920
literally just project distributor.net. And
basically if you don't have

435
00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:03.860
a blog and you have
some source, you're not really

436
00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:06.950
interested in building a community
and you want to throw

437
00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:11.060
it up somewhere and have
it hosted. Yeah. Project distributor.net

438
00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:15.080
has dozens and dozens of
projects. You can group them,

439
00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:19.040
you can add administrators, you
can have multiple releases and

440
00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:21.760
it's just basically a place
to store your zip files.

441
00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:24.590
So if you've got some
intellectual property and some, some

442
00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:28.130
thoughtful stuff, and you want
to throw it out there,

443
00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:29.840
I think that's a great
place. It sounds like a

444
00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:32.180
lot of the stuff that
you've got would, could belong

445
00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:33.830
up something like that. I
would put a license on

446
00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:36.500
it though. Right. You know,
without a license it's, it's

447
00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:38.840
found, it's kind of found
stuff. Even if the license

448
00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:41.720
is, I'm not liable for
you ruining your life with

449
00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:45.580
my source code. So, So
then, then would you go

450
00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:52.210
to www.opensource.orgslashlicensesorhshrinks.com H seven D,
is that where you would

451
00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:54.130
start? I would go up
there and I would pick

452
00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:57.190
one. That was, that made
sense to you? I think

453
00:24:57.190 --> 00:24:59.770
that the BSD license is
the kind of the closest

454
00:24:59.770 --> 00:25:03.430
thing to the don't Sue
me and enjoy kind of

455
00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:07.600
license. Right? Yeah. And if,
if somebody wants to use

456
00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:10.930
it in a commercial product,
that's totally okay. Yeah. Cause

457
00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:12.700
you understand, when you put
source code out like that

458
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.680
and you know, you might
want to say I'd like

459
00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:16.450
my name in the source
code. Right. And there are

460
00:25:16.450 --> 00:25:19.630
licenses that basically say, don't
remove my name, make sure

461
00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:22.480
that I get credit. I,
you know, this copyright notice

462
00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:26.050
must remain on. Or what
about a license that says,

463
00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:28.840
you know, you can feel
free to use it, but

464
00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:30.970
if you're gonna use it
in commercial software, you need

465
00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:33.490
to, you know, work out
a royalty arrangement with me

466
00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:38.590
or something. Is there, Yeah.
Those licenses exist. You can

467
00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:41.380
do that. There's various modified
versions of all these different

468
00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:47.260
licenses. There's a whole, whole
series of them up@theopensource.org licenses

469
00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:49.930
site. And you can certainly,
you know, write your own,

470
00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:51.850
but chances are someone else
has already thought of it.

471
00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.070
Yeah. Or you can just
be, you know, really awesome.

472
00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:55.900
And just give your software
way. Like if you go

473
00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:59.440
to sliver.com, you know, Jeff Key
has been putting up little

474
00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:02.200
applets up there in zip
files, full of source for

475
00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:07.780
years, it's a treasure trove
of, of.net goodness. And he

476
00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:12.370
just basically throws up there
and they are amazing applications.

477
00:26:12.370 --> 00:26:16.240
Applets often he'll write an
article around them and put

478
00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:19.270
the article up on, on
MSDN. I mean, he's almost

479
00:26:19.270 --> 00:26:23.620
kind of a one man.
SourceForge okay. You could certainly

480
00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:26.050
do that, but get it
out there. I mean, if

481
00:26:26.050 --> 00:26:27.820
you've got COVID on your
hard drive, put it out

482
00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:30.220
there, Google will find that
eventually. So looking at our

483
00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:35.020
list of links, what, what
haven't we talked about? Let

484
00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:40.120
me see. We talked about
contributing a patch. If you

485
00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:42.400
have, if you're involved in
an open source project or

486
00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:45.540
maybe that you are some
software, make sure that you

487
00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:48.450
read about how to contribute
a patch because chances are,

488
00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:50.310
you may have found a
bug and chances are, you

489
00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:52.800
know, how to fix it
shrinks your slash H seven

490
00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:57.870
five. Also, if you use
things like CVS or subversion,

491
00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:00.540
we've got a tutorial on
how to use what are

492
00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:03.840
called universal dif files or
patch files at shrink stir

493
00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:08.910
slash H seven four. And
the, we know the Wikipedia,

494
00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:11.670
even though it is managed
by the people has some

495
00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:15.690
very good information on different
kinds of licenses. I've read

496
00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:19.140
all the different articles it
has on specific on software

497
00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:21.690
licensing. And for the most
part, it's, it's very well

498
00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:23.910
written. It's very thoughtful and
it offers a very, fairly

499
00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:27.630
balanced view of the different
licenses as well as the

500
00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:33.540
BSD versus GPL arguments. Frankly,
just get, get involved, remember

501
00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:37.530
that when you download software
that is free and use

502
00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:42.210
it, someone probably spent a
weekend or many weekends working

503
00:27:42.210 --> 00:27:44.850
on that stuff. You know,
even if you just think

504
00:27:44.850 --> 00:27:47.580
about it and think, wow,
Hey, thanks guy. Or drop

505
00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:50.970
them a note. Like, what
is it? I think it

506
00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:54.900
says, slick run my favorite
launcher. It's got, I think

507
00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:57.240
it's the, as you install
it, he pops up a

508
00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:59.160
dialogue that says he can
fill out the survey and

509
00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:00.570
tell me what you think,
you know, will you, will

510
00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:03.150
you reward the developer with
a single minute of your

511
00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:06.000
time? Hmm. I think what
a thoughtful way to do

512
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.570
that is even if it's
compliment where or post postcard

513
00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:13.620
where, you know, do that,
don't just download it and

514
00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:15.510
then get pissed off because
it doesn't work the way

515
00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:18.710
you want. Okay, Scott. Well,
It really opened my eyes

516
00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:20.870
a bit to the world
of open source. I hope

517
00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:24.800
that the listeners have been
educated as well as always.

518
00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:27.290
Thanks a lot. You're welcome.
All right. And we'll see

519
00:28:27.290 --> 00:28:29.030
you next week on handsome.
