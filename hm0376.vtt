talks with Dan Bricklin about
the future and past of

9
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.900
computing. I'm Scott Hanselman. This
is another episode of Hansel

10
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.720
minutes, and I've got with
me today. Dan Bricklin often

11
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.810
referred to as the father
of the spreadsheet, and you've

12
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.390
seen him before, actually on
this developer's life. I'm happy

13
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.460
to have you here, sir.
How are you? I'm doing

14
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.460
really well. I'm kind of
a sad, a couple of

15
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.660
days here. You probably noticed
that Douglas ankle Bart passed

16
00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:22.160
away. Yeah. I just saw
that and started watching some

17
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.990
of the old videos and
I looked at old pictures.

18
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.930
I found an old picture
of me with him and

19
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:34.970
con and Bob Metcalf. Wow.
But then I saw that

20
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.910
Mark Bernstein posted a picture
of Ted Nelson with him

21
00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:46.730
and Aaron Schwartz. Wow. It's really
cool. Ted also helped popularize

22
00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.990
to the next generation hypertext.
Yeah, these are, these are

23
00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.380
the, kind of the, the,
his history of computing people

24
00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.900
that I don't think the
average Joe knows the names

25
00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.060
of like, you know, people
don't even know Ted Berners

26
00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.990
Lee, Tim Berners Lee, rather,
but they probably couldn't ask

27
00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.670
a hundred people and have
them tell you who that

28
00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.740
was. Angle bar was no.
On the other hand, they

29
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.220
all know what a mouse
is. Exactly. And he's the

30
00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.860
one who made the, got
the first one made and

31
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.460
had reasons and invented the
reasons why we would want

32
00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.640
it well. And when I
was watching, cause I think

33
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.230
that if, when, if you
don't know who Douglas Engelbart

34
00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.810
is going go and do
the Googling and look it

35
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.090
up, but be sure to
watch the mother of all

36
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.260
demos. It's up on YouTube.
This was in 1968 and

37
00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.450
he was doing stuff. And
I was in my mind

38
00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.300
trying to do the same
thing with word with Microsoft

39
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.250
word. And I'm watching him
do some editing stuff. And

40
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.490
I'm like, gosh, it's 2013
and I'm not actually sure

41
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.340
how to do that in
word. I mean, he's collapsing,

42
00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.660
like, you know, like doing
outlining and he's links and

43
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.550
he's doing was a real
time video conferencing and he

44
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.640
demoed all this lie. Yeah.
He did it live in

45
00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.790
1968. He was doing, you
know, line numbering and he

46
00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.150
had a headset. I mean,
if it wasn't in black

47
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.300
and white, he could have
been demoing the latest version

48
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.310
of windows. It just happened
to be all texted in

49
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.470
black and white. It was
really quite sophisticated. The mouse

50
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.880
was extremely smooth. Yeah. Well
the fact that they, I

51
00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.340
mean, they had, they had
light pins before and stuff

52
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.340
like that, but it wasn't
like that. And you know,

53
00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.200
they had the mouse, they
showed two people using the

54
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.870
male simultaneously one in one
room in one, you know,

55
00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.330
at a distance. And he's,
you know, and he, I

56
00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:32.970
mean, he was inspired by
Vanderbush before I'm each person's

57
00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.020
inspired and then can inspire,
inspire others like Ted Nelson

58
00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.950
who wrote the book computer
live that inspired others like

59
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.150
Dave Weiner and who inspired
a lot of people who

60
00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.600
got things that we have
today that now inspire the

61
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.960
people who think they're inventing
at all. Sure. If you

62
00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.300
remember the video, but he
has his mouse in the

63
00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.130
right hand, he has his
keyboard and he has some

64
00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.740
kind of a cording hot
key. What is that? On

65
00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:02.280
the left? He was experimenting
with different types of input

66
00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.770
devices and the mouse was
one of his experiments, but

67
00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.350
he had the cord keyboard
where basically you would push,

68
00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.100
you could use multiple fingers
and push one button to,

69
00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.800
you know, in different chords.
And that was ways of

70
00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.130
being able to type into
the computer. He had what,

71
00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.100
that accord keyboard, a mouse
and a real keyboard. And

72
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.340
he was experimenting with different
forms of input. Do you

73
00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.560
think that that is representative
of like, like I've got

74
00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.660
a, a natural keyboard in
front of me with some

75
00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.780
hot keys on top. I've
got the function keys, which

76
00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.640
have now been standardized, but
I don't spend a lot

77
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.190
of time other than using
modifiers, like control shift and

78
00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.350
alt there's not a lot
of cording in my life.

79
00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.110
I guess it turned out
that it was while people

80
00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.270
could learn it, it wasn't
something people could come up

81
00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.610
with, but they were experimenting
in those days. They were

82
00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.770
inventing the things that we
take for granted when we

83
00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.920
think is normal. So that's
why, that's why everybody is

84
00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.370
making such a big deal
about his life. Because you

85
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.190
know, somebody comes up with
this stuff for the first

86
00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.610
time and does the experimentation
and throws out and then

87
00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.480
eventually throw out the stuff
that doesn't catch on. Or

88
00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.310
we later on, we find
out that maybe now it's

89
00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.870
okay to do that. The,
that level of historical context.

90
00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.640
I mean, I know he
was in his late eighties

91
00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.560
when he passed away a
couple of days ago, but

92
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.860
he must be just watching
these things and both being

93
00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.370
excited that they have reached
a ubiquity, but also saying

94
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:26.130
gosh, 40 years and nothing
really interesting has happened. His

95
00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.200
mouse is an idea that
we point to all the

96
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.120
time when you say, well,
how long did it take

97
00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:33.150
and why don't people use
this great new thing right

98
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:34.740
away? Why don't they get
it? I mean, look how

99
00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.740
long it took them to
get Twitter or blogging number.

100
00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.640
They made fun of blogging
back in, in 2004 at

101
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.220
the democratic national convention, they
were making fun of the

102
00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:48.210
bloggers. And of course now,
you know, every Twitter we'll

103
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.970
forget about that, but we
look at the males and

104
00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:55.320
we say, Hmm, the mouse
was shown publicly in 1968.

105
00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:01.340
And then it until 1984,
that it got onto a

106
00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.940
machine that actually we still
have with us today that

107
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.000
is popular. It was, there
were other mouse, you know,

108
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.300
the Alto and the star
and stuff like that. You

109
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.660
use the mouse, but, and
Lisa, but it wasn't till

110
00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:19.070
1984 with the Macintosh that
it started to become, come

111
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:23.870
in the normal, into normal
people's consciousness. Now, of course,

112
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.330
you know, and then even
after 84, it wasn't until

113
00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:30.590
what like windows 90, whatever
95 or whatever that it

114
00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:34.160
was like really well accepted
in all of computing, dumb

115
00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.680
in person. That's a long
time. It is a long

116
00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:41.530
time. We're talking about 20,
30 years. I remember trying

117
00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:44.080
to teach my family how
to right click and had

118
00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.320
a DoubleClick. Like they used
to be tutorials on, have

119
00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:48.850
a success rate, double click.
Cause it's just not enough.

120
00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.440
Well, that's, that's why we
need people learning from others.

121
00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:56.500
I think what's in the
markups article. And the times

122
00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:00.070
that mentioned the first mouse
had as many buttons as

123
00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:02.830
he could fit on it.
Obviously with this cord thing,

124
00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:05.710
he was into thinking of
multiple, multiple buttons that have

125
00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:08.380
three buttons on it. And
that's what they used for

126
00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:10.600
a while. They, you have
like a select button in

127
00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.750
it. And then, you know,
jobs came in and said,

128
00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:15.310
no, let's make it simple.
We'll just have one button

129
00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:18.220
pretty close. Then you can
only can't push the wrong

130
00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:21.310
button. Or then they had
to come up with the

131
00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:25.660
equivalent, according with double clicking,
flicking and holding, and then

132
00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.200
holding down a key and
clicking there, holding down another

133
00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:33.580
key and flipping. So maybe
he wasn't so wrong, but

134
00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:37.450
you know, it was it's
this, each of us add

135
00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:39.880
our own, his jobs at
his stuff to it and

136
00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:43.060
others add to it. And
we end up with what

137
00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:46.660
we have today. I wish
my wife was sorting through

138
00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:49.720
thousands of photographs to put
together a baby book for

139
00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.990
my oldest son yesterday. And
I was watching her do

140
00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:54.790
it. I was kind of
watching in a detached way

141
00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:57.310
because wives, I have found
don't like it, if you

142
00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:59.410
snatch the mouse from them
and show them how to

143
00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:02.260
use something. And even though
she's a highly educated and

144
00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:06.640
very successful person in finance
and has an advanced degree,

145
00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:09.940
I, she was struggling just
to have two windows open

146
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.300
and have them appropriately sized.
And then rather than using

147
00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:16.270
the scroll wheel that her
finger was resting on, she

148
00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:18.790
was choosing to go down
and pick the little tiny

149
00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:21.970
eight pixel by eight pixel
down arrow to scroll down.

150
00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:24.250
And I like, gosh, I
thought this was a solved

151
00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:27.550
problem. We can snap two
windows together, like Norton commander,

152
00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:29.140
and we can roll with
her. And I kept showing

153
00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:31.960
her the rolly wheel. And
she says that doesn't work

154
00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.900
for me. Yeah. I mean,
especially since some apps that

155
00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:38.140
works in summit doesn't and
of course Apple made it

156
00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:43.390
go upside down, but sometimes
you'll just skip right ahead,

157
00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:46.870
like the touch. But then
if you know, when, when

158
00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:50.260
the original surface Microsoft surface,
the one that was huge,

159
00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:53.650
actually there was a table
and they were doing sorting

160
00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:56.040
a pictures with it. You
could see how that would

161
00:08:56.040 --> 00:09:00.480
work. And now with things
like the Dell XPS 27,

162
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.790
that huge, you know, and
you can sort of pull

163
00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:05.340
it down or the Lenovo
and others that you can

164
00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:07.410
put on the desk. We
now can actually do the

165
00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:10.440
sorting of the pictures that
way, which is more natural.

166
00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:14.590
A flicking motion to just
say, Put this over here,

167
00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.180
drag this over here. Let's
put juxtapose these together, put

168
00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:21.800
that in a pile with
the big screens, you know,

169
00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:26.120
maybe the scroll wheel wasn't
the natural thing. Yeah. But

170
00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.580
it also gets into simplicity.
A lot of people like

171
00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:33.320
to learn a few tools
and use them. And there

172
00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:38.660
was, was it people like
w like to be able

173
00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:41.240
to say, I have this
general purpose thing, I know

174
00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.220
how to use. And it
does all these things for

175
00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:46.880
me. It's why they'll in
the old days where the

176
00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.860
accountants would learn a spreadsheet
and then would do word

177
00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:50.660
processing in it. Cause they
don't want to learn a

178
00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:53.030
word processor. They already knew
the spreadsheet and they had

179
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:56.750
this one tool that was
good enough for them. Sometimes

180
00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:01.990
don't bother me with it.
When you're a programmer programmers

181
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.980
who really get into the
tools you want to have,

182
00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:06.890
what angle Bart had, the
cord that you can, Oh,

183
00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:08.390
if you do what we
call it, we used to

184
00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:10.940
call it the command shift,
Coke bottle. You would push

185
00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:13.880
all this. You would, you
would have all these modifier

186
00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:17.660
keys to use Emacs or
whatever. And now you're showing

187
00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:20.120
off that stuff. When you're,
you're showing off the IDs,

188
00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:23.870
you know, like visual studio,
a programmer learns to have

189
00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:27.110
all these tools. Well, most
people were used to saying,

190
00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:31.070
well, you know, a hammer
screwdriver and you know, a

191
00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:34.370
vice grip is good enough
for me while you know,

192
00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:37.400
a real person who really
needs their tools probably has

193
00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:41.210
boxes. It's huge, you know,
tool chest with many just

194
00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:45.180
the right tool for the
right thing. And that's, that's

195
00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:49.160
an interesting jump. I mean,
I watch people who actually

196
00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.350
can dream almost an IMAX,
you know, and be able

197
00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:54.080
to, you know, hitting the
shifts in whatever. I find

198
00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:56.570
it sometimes easier just to
retire because I type fast

199
00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:59.810
enough rather than try to
say, well, what is, you

200
00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:02.510
know, what's the control thing
for backing up two words

201
00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:07.730
and go halfway and you
know, so it's different thinking

202
00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:11.180
for different people. And we
have to remember the different

203
00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:14.090
people do think different ways.
Well, you wrote a famous

204
00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:17.390
essay called why Johnny can't
program, where you kind of

205
00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:21.860
explore those things. And I
was a, an adjunct professor

206
00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:25.760
at a state school teaching
software engineering. And I had

207
00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:28.160
to go to the Dean
and say, this is a

208
00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.190
particular fella. Who's just taken
my class. And I just

209
00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:33.440
know I want them to
be successful, but I don't

210
00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:36.430
think he should be a
programmer on that. Let me

211
00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:38.390
rephrase it. Wasn't that? I
don't think he should be.

212
00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:40.490
I just said, I don't
think he could be successful

213
00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:42.380
because I just simply don't
think his brain is wired

214
00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:44.990
that way. And that's the
way just like, you know,

215
00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:49.190
I can't compose good news
brain decisions. Why is it

216
00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:52.010
that an intellectual pursuits like
programming one would say something

217
00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:53.320
like, I don't think it
should be a program. Like,

218
00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.400
well, I'm going to be
a program and I'm going

219
00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:57.040
to, you watch me right
through sheer force of will.

220
00:11:57.850 --> 00:11:59.440
I don't think any force
of will is going to

221
00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:08.100
make me Right. Or a
Michael Jordan or that's Michael Jordan. Couldn't

222
00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:11.240
play baseball at the level
of other people. Right. That

223
00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:13.860
he's Michael Jordan. He's probably disappointed
that that was a very

224
00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:18.810
interesting example there, you know,
you know, people who have

225
00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:22.860
incredible wheels still can't necessarily
do it, but sometimes you

226
00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:28.470
can. Yeah. It's programmers. Well,
there's something magic about programmers

227
00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:31.350
to people. They know in
the old days, being a

228
00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:34.050
programmer was such an unusual
skill that they would put

229
00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:38.430
up with all sorts of
personality, strangeness that they wouldn't

230
00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:42.300
put up in other parts
of the same business. Cause

231
00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:46.860
they were so desperate for
which led to advantages that

232
00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:49.530
people who had those personality
traits were now able to

233
00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:51.500
get where we will peg
and drives it couldn't be

234
00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:56.220
before. And not that everybody
had those, but it meant

235
00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:59.130
that if you had those
traits, this is a job

236
00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:01.590
that you could get. And
if you were able to

237
00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:03.990
program at all, you know,
people thought that you were

238
00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:07.770
great or some tools started
coming in that made it

239
00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:11.580
possible, were other types of
people to be able to

240
00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:16.110
program. And then it being
a program where you can

241
00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:19.140
be more likely to be
more normal. Do you think

242
00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:22.410
that those, do you think
those personality types have set

243
00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:24.630
us up such that with
programmers? And I believe that

244
00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:27.060
it's the case that there's,
this there's a program or

245
00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:29.400
glass ceiling. Like if you're
at a company that is

246
00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:33.180
run by business people and
you are not the CTO,

247
00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:35.280
there's this, there's only so
much money you're going to

248
00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:37.590
make as a program or
even as programmer number one,

249
00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:41.280
because ultimately the CEO and
the CXO signs, the checks

250
00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:44.700
isn't that historical like it's
because we used to be,

251
00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.500
Well, no, it may be
negotiating and other, you know,

252
00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:51.990
about the position on the
other hand, you know, that

253
00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:56.760
the head of development or
whatever has in their, you

254
00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:00.870
know, their pockets, so to
speak, not being as protection

255
00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:03.750
for themselves, they know who
the super programmer is. And

256
00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:05.640
if they moved to another
company, they would make sure

257
00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:09.360
that they brought that person
along. It's you know, like,

258
00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:13.710
you know, that's, I remember
there was a Steven Seagal

259
00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:17.330
movie where the, the head
of the boards of the

260
00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:20.460
Admiral or whatever had this
Navy seal, he kept with

261
00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:22.650
him all the time. Right.
He knew that's what he

262
00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:27.450
needed. And you know, the
old samurai having the right,

263
00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:29.130
you know, you hire the
right samurai to be there

264
00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:32.070
with you. I'm sure it's
the same, but the pro,

265
00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:35.010
but the pay and the
people outside don't need it.

266
00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:38.670
And often the programmer, you
know, doesn't push for it,

267
00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:40.650
but some do, and we
just don't see those, like

268
00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:42.750
would not be in the
world that many of us

269
00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:47.550
are in. Do you think
that programming should be mysterious

270
00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:49.680
or do you think that
there is a room for

271
00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:52.910
these is modern, you know,
like text boxes over data,

272
00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:54.920
that's a line of business
app, right? It's just a

273
00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:57.650
regular old, real business app.
Like your SAP is and

274
00:14:57.650 --> 00:15:02.510
your Salesforce is, should I
a programmer be writing those?

275
00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:04.910
Or should my wife, someone
who has a deep understanding

276
00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:07.210
of business be writing those?
Well, it depends on what

277
00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:11.440
the application, I mean, I
think that it's people who

278
00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:14.950
are good at what's needed
for the particular application should

279
00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:18.730
write it. So you would
want somebody who knows business

280
00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:22.510
using a spreadsheet, do business
stuff, rather than somebody who

281
00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:25.630
doesn't know business, either using
his spreadsheet or writing it

282
00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:28.720
in C or something like
that, it doesn't understand the

283
00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:32.140
problem. So for a lot
of businesses stuff, we want

284
00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:35.560
the domain expert for games.
You want somebody who has

285
00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:39.760
a feel for both the
gaming, you know, and to

286
00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:42.220
make it, you know, and
you want somebody else to

287
00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:44.560
appeal for the sound and
seeing a feel for the

288
00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:47.560
visuals, as well as somebody
who has a feel for

289
00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:51.370
how to make it work
real fast, feel good. So

290
00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:57.550
there's different skills demanded by
the particular application. So if

291
00:15:57.550 --> 00:16:00.640
you're just talking about filling
in forms and if it's

292
00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:03.280
rarely, it's not used too
much, and it's used by

293
00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:05.470
the same people who know
it, you can get by

294
00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:08.440
with the people who need,
it might as well build

295
00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:12.400
it themselves if they can.
That's why things like the

296
00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:17.860
spreadsheet became so popular. Think
of initially programming was done

297
00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:22.120
by, you know, special people
are likely math PhD, if

298
00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:25.510
they're women initially, and we're
still, they didn't realize where

299
00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:29.260
the, what, you know, the,
the, the people that built

300
00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.540
the computers were not considered
the special people and the

301
00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:34.030
people program where it's special
in the old, old, old

302
00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:36.010
days. And then the people
built it where the program

303
00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:40.510
was working, then the programmers
were. And, but then, you

304
00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:43.150
know, cause the programming was
a machine language and then

305
00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:47.560
they invented Fortran and scientists
could write in something that

306
00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:51.340
was kind of mathematical and
mathematical mathematicians could write in

307
00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:55.480
a sort of mathematical language
and get things done. And

308
00:16:57.010 --> 00:17:00.220
Peter, the use of computers
took off a lot. So,

309
00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:05.470
you know, the web took
off when it was, you

310
00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:07.870
could just take Microsoft word
and push a button and

311
00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:11.140
get HTML out of it,
Lousy HTML, but in HTML

312
00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:13.810
and D Yes, no, we
as programmers knew how well

313
00:17:15.370 --> 00:17:17.830
look, how look, how it
takes twice as long to

314
00:17:17.830 --> 00:17:22.090
download on that. On the
other hand, people said, yeah,

315
00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:26.140
here's a, an example that
I remember is I worked

316
00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:30.010
at word processing very early
screen-based word processing back in

317
00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:34.960
mid seventies. And we were
very much consumed by litter

318
00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:38.230
quality printing. We wanted it
to look as good as

319
00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:41.800
a letter typed on a
good typewriter and, you know,

320
00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:43.990
dot matrix printers just couldn't
do it. And so we

321
00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:47.140
didn't Daisy wheel printer. When
I was at DEC digital,

322
00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:49.950
we had to teach the
guys at the envelope about

323
00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:51.660
how to do a better
printer to make it work

324
00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:53.910
better. And so we were
so proud. And then what

325
00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:55.500
did people end up doing?
You know, then there was

326
00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:58.620
the laser printer, the laser
jet. Wow. It looks just

327
00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:01.590
like a typewriter and, or
set. And then people throw

328
00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:03.660
it in fax machines and
it looked like a dot

329
00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:06.600
matrix printer. Again, they didn't
care. They cared about. I

330
00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:09.180
mean, they originally did, but
it was more important for

331
00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:12.690
them to get it there
in time to get it

332
00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:14.970
there immediately. There was some
other things that were more

333
00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:18.240
important to them about the
problem and what we thought

334
00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:22.050
was important suddenly was really
secondary to them. So that's

335
00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:23.880
the same thing. I mean,
you know, we care about,

336
00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:27.270
you know, well-crafted code and
all that, which does matter

337
00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:31.620
for certain things, but it
doesn't always, especially if you

338
00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:34.800
have to get it programmed
quick, I mean, programs that

339
00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:38.310
are available after they're needed
is not a good thing.

340
00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:41.880
If you have a, a
sales, you're gonna have a,

341
00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:44.100
a, you know, a sales
campaign and you want to

342
00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:48.840
support your salespeople with programs
for it, having it the

343
00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:51.660
week after the sales campaign
is over because the programmers

344
00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:53.130
were still working on it
is not a good thing.

345
00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:56.190
You know, you want to,
you know, how long it

346
00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:58.020
takes to get it done
and how good it looks

347
00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:00.270
and all that, the fact
that can't win an award,

348
00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:04.440
you know, it doesn't matter.
There were other things that

349
00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:07.250
were more important. The problem
matters, right? I mean, I

350
00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:11.450
know that last year in
Japan, they sold 2 million fax

351
00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:15.080
machines. Like the world has
left fax machines behind except

352
00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:17.990
Japan. Yeah. It'll be close
to their language. It still

353
00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:21.440
has its advantages for handwritten
stuff. Yeah. They value the

354
00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:24.050
facts between the value of
the paper, the physicality of

355
00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:27.950
it, and the immediacy of
it. And I was in,

356
00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:29.930
when I did the last
few years, I've been doing

357
00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:33.090
programming on the iPad and
I did a note note

358
00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:36.440
taking program called note taker
HD. And they are, people

359
00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:42.020
were doing handwritten notes and
initially it was very popular

360
00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:45.110
among medical students. And that
surprised me, you know, with

361
00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:49.310
all sorts of others later
on. But when I allowed

362
00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:51.650
you to Mark up PDF
files and then all sorts

363
00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:53.930
of people were interested in
it, but medical students are

364
00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:58.340
taking notes that you can't
type and they're taking they're

365
00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:00.920
drawing and they're doing, you
know, and they're doing chemistry

366
00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:03.660
and they're doing this and
that. And if they wanted

367
00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:09.650
to, to use computers, they
needed handwritten. And then it

368
00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:13.430
was, was, was opened up
by having the ability to

369
00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:18.650
do handwriting into kept as
handwriting into the, the iPad,

370
00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:21.500
which is really cool. And
there are all sorts of

371
00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:27.800
areas like that where, you
know, we, we suddenly find

372
00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:30.740
out that computing works for
when we have the right

373
00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:34.250
equipment, the facts worked for
people who want paper and

374
00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:39.350
paper out, you know, and,
you know, it's, it's kind

375
00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:42.590
of easier sometimes than scanning
to a PDF, emailing the

376
00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:46.430
PDF and then printing a
new PDF. How did your,

377
00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:50.800
your, your kind of movement
into mobile workout for you?

378
00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:53.050
I know you were very
excited about note taker HD.

379
00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:56.490
I was. And for good
reason, it did very well

380
00:20:57.570 --> 00:21:00.840
in 2011, I think at
the end of the year,

381
00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:03.570
Apple shows how well apps
did. And it was in

382
00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:07.770
the top 50 as I
recall, or eight iPad apps.

383
00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:11.520
Wow. That's pretty good. I've
made, I made a real

384
00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:15.180
good living as a programmer,
being an I a, an

385
00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:18.540
iPad developer. I'm still making
money off of it. And

386
00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:22.020
is it done? Oh yeah,
well done. No, you're constantly

387
00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:23.760
have to upgrade it the
last time I upgraded it

388
00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:28.650
was I think in November
and, you know, I've been

389
00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:30.600
busy with some other things
since, so I haven't done

390
00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:33.060
much more work on it.
I have a lot of

391
00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:38.310
partially done things, done, some
other iOS stuff since, but

392
00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:41.430
with iOS seven, if I
have to upgrade it to

393
00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:45.630
do special support for iOS
seven plus it's incompatible, I'll

394
00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:47.430
go back to programming it.
I mean, I've got a

395
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:49.350
lot of users or use
it, use it every day.

396
00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:52.260
I'm still doing tech support
for it. And I get

397
00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:57.430
$3 and 15 cents after Apple
takes their cut blocks. And

398
00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:00.270
yet, you know, I'll be
on the phone or, you

399
00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:04.230
know, through email, whatever. So
you, you use it all

400
00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:08.220
the time. It's a fundamental
part of your, Well, when

401
00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:09.810
I'm at conferences and stuff,
it's how I take my

402
00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:16.620
notes, you know, but it's,
you know, I, I mean,

403
00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:18.540
I'm mainly coding and stuff,
so I don't need that

404
00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:21.030
much. And actually doing a
lot of video. One thing

405
00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:25.560
that's, that's one of the
interesting things about in mobile,

406
00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:29.040
you, you do video is
the way you show it.

407
00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:31.200
I mean, if you have
to sort of demo a

408
00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.900
lot, you don't have, we
don't have tool tips at

409
00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:36.780
this point. The Samsung is
starting to show the ability

410
00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:40.650
to do that on theirs.
But, you know, so when

411
00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:44.280
you do your, your demonstrations
and your videos, people expect

412
00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:46.650
to watch a video, learn
it on the spot and

413
00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:49.050
then be able to use
the application. You have to

414
00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:51.720
learn how to be able
to shoot that in cameras

415
00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:55.320
and good sound and stuff
like that, to be able

416
00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:59.130
to do those. No, you're
certainly still bullish on, on

417
00:22:59.130 --> 00:23:01.770
mobile, right? I mean, you
know, you just recently joined

418
00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:07.080
alpha software as their CTO.
That seems like a, I

419
00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:08.820
don't know. I just assume
that you would be independent.

420
00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:10.290
You'd want to do your
own thing. I know you're

421
00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:12.540
excited about mobile and you're,
you know, you're still, of

422
00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:14.610
course is going to do
note taker HD, but why

423
00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:18.810
start? Why, why join a
company? Well, the company is,

424
00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:20.460
first of all, there were
friends of mine that I've

425
00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:23.550
known for many years who
founded the company and run

426
00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:27.390
it. And I used to
run my business on one

427
00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:31.080
of their older products, way
back when alpha for it

428
00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:34.740
was a product for a
database. It's a database, you

429
00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:37.650
know, like it's a pre
access product. And it was

430
00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:40.740
a real easy to use,
but very powerful system. And

431
00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:44.250
even though I was coding
in C and assembler and

432
00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:47.480
selling my old Brooklyn's demo
program, I did all my

433
00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:51.080
invoicing and, you know, shipping
labels and all that. I

434
00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:54.380
did that without though, plus
it was aimed for somebody

435
00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:57.260
who wanted to get the
job done fast forward to

436
00:23:57.260 --> 00:24:01.640
now. And I was looking,
Hmm, people are using note-taker

437
00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:05.450
HD to fill out intake
forms. If, you know, for

438
00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:08.330
doctors and stuff, you know,
when they, the patients come

439
00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:10.610
in, they would take a
PDF and Mark it up

440
00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:13.430
and, you know, check off
this and that. And then,

441
00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:17.810
then I guess then the
receptionist types in whatever, but

442
00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:24.020
realistic data input is a
big thing. And businesses really

443
00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:29.090
want to use the news,
the tablets and the mobile

444
00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:35.570
devices for business applications of
transactions and data acquisition, just

445
00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:38.630
for reading. And it's not
just a data consumption device.

446
00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:41.000
And I tell them, let's
get into that. And I

447
00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:42.590
like to build a thing
with this, but then I

448
00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:44.420
have to do the backend.
I want to connect to

449
00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:46.490
the database. I want to
have to build a report

450
00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:49.670
generator. Cause sometimes you want
to actually produce reports and

451
00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:51.260
I'm going to have to
do, wow. That's a lot

452
00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:53.270
of work. And then I
saw the guys at alpha,

453
00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:56.720
they have that already. I
said, Oh, you're doing that.

454
00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:59.870
Hmm. And I had already
felt that if you want

455
00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:04.100
to do something, it's got
to run everywhere. So, you

456
00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:07.610
know, if you can do
it with HTML five, that

457
00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:10.820
would be really good. I
had done a lot of

458
00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:14.180
work when I was doing
social calc, which is a

459
00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:17.990
JavaScript spreadsheet a few years
ago. I knew how you

460
00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:23.240
could make some really good
things in JavaScript. The modern

461
00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:26.480
JavaScript with the modern browsers
are even better. So I've

462
00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:29.720
been playing with that with
trying, trying to put my

463
00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:33.230
spreadsheet on a tablet and,
Oh, they're neat. You wise,

464
00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:36.110
you can do, I should
experiment here. And it turned

465
00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:38.510
out that the alpha people,
they had been going the

466
00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:41.810
same direction. They have been
retooling their system that was

467
00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:45.590
web based to be HTML
five based for the mobile

468
00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:49.180
stuff. Cetera. So it's like,
well, you're already doing all

469
00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:51.980
this work. Why don't I
just join you and do

470
00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:55.370
some of the innovation on
the new stuff without having

471
00:25:55.370 --> 00:25:57.350
to build all those things
in the backend. Plus I

472
00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:59.720
don't have to worry about
supporting servers and stuff. So

473
00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:01.640
that's why I did that.
Plus I had been working

474
00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:03.320
alone for a long time.
It was fine to work

475
00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:07.060
with some other people. Is
this co-generation or is it

476
00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:09.250
a, is it a whole
language? And then it generates

477
00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:13.000
HTML. Is that hide the
HTML from you? Yes and

478
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.300
no. They're the, the alpha
way of doing things the

479
00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:19.660
way their style that their
applications always plan is that

480
00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:26.050
you, you develop in a,
in a system that's like

481
00:26:26.050 --> 00:26:28.870
property sheet, sheet based, you
know, like in visual basic,

482
00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:30.970
when you, when you put
in a control, you do

483
00:26:30.970 --> 00:26:33.130
everything by putting all the
properties you say, I want

484
00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:37.570
to be this wide, whatever.
And then if you need

485
00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:41.380
to code something like on
this event, do this, you

486
00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:44.490
can drop into language. What
they do is they have

487
00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:48.390
all the common cases already
built in or one dropdown

488
00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:52.290
lists. So the common cases
are all there, but at

489
00:26:52.290 --> 00:26:55.200
any point you can drop
in and actually code in

490
00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:59.010
CSS, directly code and Java
script directly code in, in

491
00:26:59.010 --> 00:27:03.000
SQL, directly in SQL to
connect to your SQL backend

492
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.880
stuff. Cause they also have
server side stuff. You can

493
00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:08.940
connect in.net languages. If you
want on the server side

494
00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:12.330
or use their automatically created
stuff. And you can go

495
00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:16.620
back and forth between the
two. So they're producing the

496
00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:20.010
JavaScript for the client and
stuff to run on the

497
00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:22.710
server. But at any point
you can look at the

498
00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:25.800
source at any point, you
can use their stuff. And

499
00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:28.680
I like that it gives
you the power, but you

500
00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:31.110
don't have to know it.
So when a lot of

501
00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:33.090
people do who are using
it is they may or

502
00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:36.570
may not know the language
like GHG, like HTML and

503
00:27:36.570 --> 00:27:39.870
JavaScript very well, but they
can get what they need

504
00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:44.280
built. And with a little
bit of help, they, you

505
00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:46.530
know, maybe being a script
kid, even copies and something

506
00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:49.770
from somebody else, they can
get some very powerful things.

507
00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:54.120
So for example, one, one
user, one person who's developing

508
00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:58.590
apps with it is she
does a search engine optimization

509
00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:00.810
as she does that for
others. And she needed a

510
00:28:00.810 --> 00:28:05.490
workflow management system, which she
built in an alpha. And

511
00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:08.230
she used CSS themes that
she got off the web

512
00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:11.280
and whatever, but she wanted
to use Dropbox for her

513
00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:15.990
sharing data with her clients.
So somebody else shoot contacted

514
00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:19.440
who knew ALPA built the
JavaScript for her to integrate

515
00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:22.920
it into Dropbox and what
she could do, all the

516
00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:26.040
other stuff on all the
filtering and the database management

517
00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:29.940
was all done through alpha.
And that that's kinda cool

518
00:28:29.970 --> 00:28:32.220
cause she really isn't a
coder per se, but she

519
00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:34.650
built a whole system out
of it. But she has

520
00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:37.290
some really sophisticated code that
she got from somebody else

521
00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:40.320
that she knows how to
put in. And so that's,

522
00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:43.290
that's an issue. It's a
relatively high level. I mean,

523
00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:45.660
it's, it's for people who
you still have to learn

524
00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:49.200
it. I mean, it's, it's
not like, you know, blogging

525
00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:52.830
with blogger. You could just
use it and it sort

526
00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:55.430
of, it wasn't that much
to learn, right. To learn

527
00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:58.700
Excel or access or any
of the, or you know,

528
00:28:58.730 --> 00:29:02.960
fi People who are used
access. Love it because what

529
00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:05.240
they say is, Oh, access
doesn't do well when it

530
00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:07.880
comes to the web and
access doesn't do well when

531
00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:09.860
it comes to mobile. But
what am I going to

532
00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:12.440
do? I think like X,
I think in terms of

533
00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:15.740
tables, so secret cave, right.
David, what do I do?

534
00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:20.750
And I know VBA, well,
it turns out that, you

535
00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:22.730
know, a lot of the
stuff, if you want, and

536
00:29:23.450 --> 00:29:26.540
an alpha uses a basic
barrier for some of this

537
00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:30.890
stuff, if you want, It
seems like JavaScript and HTML

538
00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:33.410
five have just in the
last six months to a

539
00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:36.170
year reached that point where
we've really got a nice

540
00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:38.870
virtual machine on which we
can build, you know, stuff

541
00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:42.600
like that. Oh yeah. I,
the, there were a couple

542
00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:46.480
things. One is that it's
the virtual machines been good

543
00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:49.300
enough that we can do
incredible things, but they also

544
00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:53.200
CSS got access to the
GPU, the graphics processing unit.

545
00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:57.160
So that they're transforms. So
the smooth things we're used

546
00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:00.460
to, so they can follow
your finger, you know, and

547
00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:02.680
do the morphing from one
thing to another that we're

548
00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:06.460
used to on the mobile
platforms and even on, on

549
00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:10.150
the desktop platforms that help
you keep context that smelled

550
00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:16.180
done in hardware, by CSS
transforms and CSS animation. And

551
00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:19.420
that's really cool. So now
it's powerful enough to be

552
00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:24.010
able to do a lot
of the user interface touches

553
00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:28.180
that you would think could
only be done natively beforehand.

554
00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:32.490
Yeah. So thank God we're
there That, that, that tension

555
00:30:32.490 --> 00:30:36.300
between the native apps and
the HTML based applications kind

556
00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:38.910
of continues to go back
and forth, right. Just as

557
00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:41.010
we think something's not possible
in HTML, we pull it

558
00:30:41.010 --> 00:30:44.340
off. Yes. I mean, that's
the thing is that when

559
00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:46.650
you listen to what some
of the HTML or the

560
00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:49.410
people are building the browser
say, well, you know, I

561
00:30:49.410 --> 00:30:51.780
need it such and such.
So I modified the language.

562
00:30:51.810 --> 00:30:53.910
We, you know, we got
together, we modified the language

563
00:30:53.910 --> 00:30:56.430
and put in this, we
do this faster. So we

564
00:30:56.670 --> 00:30:58.440
got to that as a
feature, you know, it's each

565
00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:01.980
time it's remembering the old
days for Microsoft, people would

566
00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:04.410
say, well, Microsoft does this,
but they can't do that.

567
00:31:04.770 --> 00:31:08.460
And apparently that became the
number one requirement within Microsoft

568
00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:10.470
to build for the next
release, because that's how it

569
00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:13.200
looked from the outside. And
it's the same thing with

570
00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:17.520
these browser developers. And luckily
they're there multiple of them

571
00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:20.890
who work well together. It
looks like I saw an

572
00:31:20.890 --> 00:31:23.460
interview you did with, with
one of them, how they

573
00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:27.510
work well with the competition
and stuff like that and

574
00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:30.690
what they're all like. Yeah.
They all say JavaScript, can't

575
00:31:30.690 --> 00:31:36.390
do it well, we'll show
them. And that's, that's been

576
00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:38.910
cool. But go back to
the thing about the letter

577
00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:43.710
quality printing versus the fact,
or, you know, I'll use

578
00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:46.560
a spreadsheet rather than a
real program done with it.

579
00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:49.830
You know, I'm willing, a
lot of people are willing

580
00:31:50.370 --> 00:31:52.260
to make it not look
as good. I mean, we

581
00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:54.240
use the web. If you
look at how bad the

582
00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:58.260
web looked, when it started
and started taking over compared

583
00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:01.740
to native apps, the web
versus at and T interchange

584
00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:05.310
or AOL or CompuServe, it
didn't look anywhere near as

585
00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:09.030
good, but it got the
job done by regular people.

586
00:32:09.630 --> 00:32:14.370
So that's the same thing
here with, with HTML and

587
00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:19.680
JavaScript and CSS, it gets
the job done. Oh, except

588
00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:22.350
for one thing. And it
gets the job done enough.

589
00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:25.830
And perhaps the native might
be better, but we don't

590
00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:28.800
care because we're more, we
were, we'd rather have the

591
00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:32.500
project done. It's more important
to get it done. The

592
00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:37.770
thing is that even for
Apple, and if you look

593
00:32:37.770 --> 00:32:41.690
on iOS and Android and
oil all over the place,

594
00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:44.840
they use web use a
program thing, which is basically

595
00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:48.830
a little web web browser
inside the app for presenting

596
00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:51.470
text and things, because it's
really hard to do the

597
00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:54.890
things you do with HTML
real easily with text. And

598
00:32:54.890 --> 00:32:59.240
so they punt and they
drop into web views inside

599
00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:03.110
of the applications to be
able to do things so

600
00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:05.840
HTML is even better there.
And they have to admit

601
00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:09.400
it. Yeah. That, that convenience
of a really dynamic generated

602
00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:13.690
user interface on every platform,
Android, iOS, windows phone, they

603
00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:15.670
did, they drop in a
web view and they go,

604
00:33:15.670 --> 00:33:18.040
and you can tell as
a, as a technologist, you

605
00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:20.470
can tell, I don't think
the users know If your

606
00:33:21.090 --> 00:33:23.170
phone gap, a lot of
people were phone gap is

607
00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:26.740
a system that connects the
web view to the outside

608
00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:29.920
in a standard way so
that you can write once

609
00:33:30.010 --> 00:33:34.870
an HTML, JavaScript, and CSS
and deploy that. And it

610
00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:38.290
will run on all sorts
of systems on what's it

611
00:33:38.290 --> 00:33:43.420
called on even blackberries know
windows, phone, and iOS and

612
00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:47.050
Android, and be able to
access hardware, things that haven't

613
00:33:47.050 --> 00:33:54.190
been exposed yet and JavaScript.
And that's the right ones,

614
00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:57.130
right? Run everywhere matters because
of the, bring your own

615
00:33:57.130 --> 00:34:01.960
device. You know, people, they
may want an Android device

616
00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:03.880
or the company, you know,
where they also want it

617
00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:07.030
to be on iOS or
you want so writing in

618
00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:11.650
HTML and Java script means
that you can run on

619
00:34:11.650 --> 00:34:15.340
all sorts of devices. It's
why the iPhone and iPad

620
00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:19.150
were successful in some way
anyways, because you could, it

621
00:34:19.150 --> 00:34:22.480
could run the browser for
browser. You know, they were

622
00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:24.070
able to put a browser
that was just as good

623
00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:26.290
as any other rep. Well,
I think the browser on

624
00:34:26.290 --> 00:34:28.000
an, on a mobile phone,
on a good mobile phone

625
00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.650
is almost as good as
a lot of apps Operating

626
00:34:29.650 --> 00:34:33.460
systems. There's Firefox Wes coming
up. That is all operating.

627
00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:37.900
So Dean indeed. Yeah. So
that's why, you know, that's

628
00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:39.730
one reason I was willing
to join alpha B plus

629
00:34:39.730 --> 00:34:43.270
I saw they were going
this way of saying, let's

630
00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:49.180
make the target B this
HTML five. You can build

631
00:34:49.180 --> 00:34:51.310
apps that you'll be able
to just, you know, you

632
00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:55.180
can run standalone NATO on
the machine. You can serve

633
00:34:55.180 --> 00:34:58.090
them up, you know, off
of the server to be

634
00:34:58.090 --> 00:34:59.890
able to get it, which
we need to do anyway,

635
00:34:59.890 --> 00:35:03.940
when you're getting live data
all the time. That rather

636
00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:07.300
than saying, no, we're going
to generate native code and

637
00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:10.570
we're going to have to
follow all the different, all

638
00:35:10.570 --> 00:35:15.070
the different STKs as they
advanced. Cool. Well, we can

639
00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:17.470
learn about all this stuff
up on your blog. You've

640
00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:19.930
talked about why Alpha's important
and what you're doing in

641
00:35:19.930 --> 00:35:22.600
that space and why you
think that bridging the mobile

642
00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:25.780
apps, touch apps and the
web are important and listeners

643
00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:29.650
can check you out at
Dan B on Twitter. And

644
00:35:29.650 --> 00:35:31.780
I would also encourage them
to check out the episode

645
00:35:31.810 --> 00:35:34.420
of this developer's life that
we did with you last

646
00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:36.400
year, which I think was
very well received as well.

647
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:40.800
Thanks so much for talking
to me today. Well, thank

648
00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:43.350
you very much for the
opportunity. This has been another

649
00:35:43.350 --> 00:35:46.110
episode of Hanselminutes and we'll
see you again next week.
