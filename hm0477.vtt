One more thing. Let me

8
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.340
tell you about a new
sponsor gun. If you're wanting

9
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.340
to detect and diagnose errors
and crashes in your software,

10
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.190
even find problems that you
didn't know existed to improve

11
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.490
your software and Reagan might
be perfect for you. You

12
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.590

code your application, and in

13
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.770
minutes, you'll get real time
error reports with all the

14
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.860
information that you need to
fix bugs fast, you can

15
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.770
even hook it up to

21
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:40.550
Ray gun@raygun.io. <inaudible> From Hanselman
it's dot com. It's Hansel

22
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.900
minutes, a weekly discussion with
web developer and technologist Scott

23
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.980
Hanselman. This is Lawrence Ryan and
mountain show number four 77.

24
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.060
In this episode, Scott talks
with Sarah's white on about

25
00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:59.450
the state of SVG on
the web today. Hi, this

26
00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.150
is Scott Hanselman. This is
another episode of Hansel minutes.

27
00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.230
And today I'm chatting with
SVG CSS and web expert.

28
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.560
Sarah Swiden. She is a
self employed front end web

29
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.470
developer, and she's talking to
me from Lebanon. Thanks for

30
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.110
chatting with me today. Hi
Scott. Thank you. Thank you

31
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.530
for having me. You got,
so you have some amazing

32
00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.830
work online. I've looked at
your slide shares and you've

33
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.370
got this great CSS reference.
That's when I heard about

34
00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.790
you, the first it was
called the code drops CSS

35
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.000
reference. Yes it is. And
what is this? This is

36
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.270
like it's interactive. It's a
whole series of pages and

37
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.140
it's like a book. Exactly.
It's practically a book except

38
00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.650
that it's online and it
has all kinds of interactions

39
00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.960
that we would normally miss
in a printed book, for

40
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:50.450
example. Yeah, it's, it's, it's
so much more than, you

41
00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.870
know, we always find ourselves
on w three schools and,

42
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.460
you know, I feel like
when you're searching for things

43
00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:56.870
on the web and you
end up on w three

44
00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.710
schools, then you've probably made
a mistake. Yeah. And they're

45
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.010
going to tell you, would
you agree with that? Yes,

46
00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.860
definitely. I always remember whenever
someone says w three schools,

47
00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.970
I always remember the W3C,
the W3C fool's website. Have

48
00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.730
you seen that before? That's
great. That's a real place.

49
00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.600
Yes. I think it's W3C
fools.com. You should check it.

50
00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.990
Oh my goodness. I feel
like w three schools is

51
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.020
something that we should just
block from Google, Google search

52
00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.360
results. It's like experts exchange.
You know, if you know,

53
00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.190
if you went there, you
have getting a wrong answer.

54
00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.970
Well, actually that's what the
W3C fool's website was about.

55
00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.980
That was the first time
I learned that w three

56
00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.950
schools is not really a
place you should go visit

57
00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.160
when you basically, when you're
learning about CSS or whatever,

58
00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.700
it contains a set of
wrong information found on w

59
00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.150
w three schools. And some,
I think there were, there

60
00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.910
were some quotes from some
people. Yeah, you should definitely

61
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.150
check it out. Well, I
do very much enjoy wandering

62
00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.510
around on the code drops
page here on timpanis.net. And

63
00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.630
I will put a link
in the show notes, particularly

64
00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.480
because you'll be reading and
seeing code samples. And then

65
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.400
right there is a live
demo. So it's almost like

66
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.420
kind of code pens injected
in the page. Yes. And

67
00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.720
there's also the updated, hopefully
whenever possible we have a,

68
00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.460
can I use tables? So
the support information, the browser

69
00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.860
compatibility is always going to
be up to date for

70
00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.800
most entries that have a
support table. And can I

71
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.770
use, and yeah, the editor
is actually a code drops

72
00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.300
editor. We didn't embed anything
like CodePen or other. This

73
00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.170
was actually a Manuela and
Petros choice and I loved

74
00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.840
it. I loved the idea
it's totally independent. You don't

75
00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.140
have to wait for CodePen
or any other website or

76
00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.740
app is down. Your website
would be, or your demos

77
00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.130
would also be down. So
this kind of removes an

78
00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.000
additional dependency, which has always,
And it also is of

79
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.880
course, with anything that you
do very responsive, it's got

80
00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.610
quite a few break points.
So this is a great

81
00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.590
reference, you know, on an
iPad or a tablet as

82
00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.880
well. Perfect. Thank you. Yeah,
absolutely. And then talk to

83
00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.920
me about this new book.
This, what does this mean?

84
00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.900
Smashing book five? What is
that? Well, it's basically a

85
00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.950
smashing magazine does books and
every book has a number.

86
00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.830
So this year his book
has an, the number five

87
00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.650
and it's a, we are
a set of authors. Each

88
00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.260
of us writes an article
about a different topic that

89
00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.800
they specialize in. My chapter
was about SVG. And there

90
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:28.440
are chapters about Flexbox performance,
web fonts. It's really, really

91
00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.440
good. Some excellent content as
is in that book. So

92
00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.340
it's basically just a book
published by smashing magazine. This

93
00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.880
is the number five and
it's called co authored by

94
00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:43.110
a lot of authors. Yeah.
It's got a whole bunch

95
00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.600
of names that I think
we would all recognize. And

96
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.230
it's also very reasonably priced.
It's only $30 right now

97
00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.750
and it's 500 pages. It's
hard cover. This is the

98
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.510
kind of book that you
don't just put on your

99
00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.160
shelf and forget about it.
It's almost like a coffee

100
00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.300
table book. You want people
to see? It's definitely yes.

101
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.480
At the ebook. I think
I saw the Teles tweet

102
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.760
yesterday. It was said that
the ebook should be out

103
00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:10.130
this week actually. And the
paper, the printed book beginning

104
00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:12.760
of June, I think. Yeah,
very soon perhaps by the

105
00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.920
time the show is out,
people will be able to

106
00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.230
order that. And again, I'll
put links in the show

107
00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:21.700
notes. So you did a
chapter on SVG. And you

108
00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.100
know, when I started thinking
about SVG, it was many,

109
00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:27.020
many, many years ago and
we still needed a, a

110
00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.560
plugin. I had to go
and download an Adobe plugin

111
00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:32.020
to use SVG. That was
my first introduction to it.

112
00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:37.660
I wasn't even there by
the time. So you're saying

113
00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:39.310
I'm very old is what
you just said that Well,

114
00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:43.510
I'm saying, I always feel
like such an new, like

115
00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.870
a lot of developers, most
of the developers, if not

116
00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:48.940
all of them, all of
the people that I know

117
00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:52.180
have started developing at least
five years ago. So they

118
00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:55.750
always mentioned tools and they
mentioned the flash era and

119
00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:57.730
stuff like that. And I'm
like, I was, I have

120
00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:00.490
no idea what you're talking
about, but I always feel

121
00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:02.590
so shy to even say
that I have no idea

122
00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:05.320
what they're talking about. I've
been doing this for almost

123
00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:08.170
three years now and yeah,
there were no, there was

124
00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:11.620
no flash era in this
time where any plugins needed.

125
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.610
I would never have guessed
in just three years. You've

126
00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:20.230
accomplished so much. That's amazing.
Congratulations. Well, so I think

127
00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:22.210
it's really, this is really
interesting that you bring this

128
00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:25.420
up. So I used it
many, many, many years ago

129
00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:29.680
and because of my early
poor experience gave up on

130
00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.680
it, but you used it
at a time when it

131
00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:37.270
was kind of ascendant, you
know, is coming up, coming

132
00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:40.450
in its own and has
great support. Do I have

133
00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:42.940
to worry about SVG support
anymore? Is it, is it

134
00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:47.200
everywhere? Absolutely not. Absolutely not.
As the answer of do

135
00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.330
I have to worry? No.
Do not worry about it

136
00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:52.090
at all. Browser support is
excellent. The only browsers that

137
00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:55.360
don't support it are eight
and below, and I think

138
00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.700
it was Android or opera
mini. I'm not really sure,

139
00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:00.220
but any browser that does
not support it, or even

140
00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:03.400
supporting browsers, if, if the
SVG fails to load, for

141
00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:07.000
any reason, we have a
lot of fullback techniques. We

142
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.190
have so many options. You
can embed the SVG on

143
00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:11.500
the page in many different
ways. I think that by

144
00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:13.990
the time you were talking
about use to embedded using

145
00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:17.320
an embed tag. Yeah. But
now you have like seven

146
00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:20.020
ways to embed it. And
each way comes with multiple

147
00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:24.820
fallback techniques that you can
provide. So absolutely no worries

148
00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:28.720
at all about not supporting
browsers. Definitely 100% ready to

149
00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:32.080
be used today. So why
do you think that the

150
00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:36.130
kind of the mainstream, or
perhaps the enterprise developers still

151
00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:39.190
look upon SVG with an,
with an eye of suspicion?

152
00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:45.280
I'm not really sure. You
know, in my latest conference,

153
00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:48.640
when, when I spoke at
conferences and after the talk,

154
00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:50.290
people will come up to
me and start talking about

155
00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:54.520
SVG. I always still sometimes
hear people say, okay, SVG

156
00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.580
is cool as which is
awesome. All everything you said

157
00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:59.520
is really great, but I
wouldn't use it now. I

158
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:02.130
said, why not? They'd be,
they're like, it's not ready

159
00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:05.190
yet. And I'm like, yes,
it is. It is ready.

160
00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:07.890
And I really don't know.
I would love to know

161
00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:10.410
the reasons behind them. I
mean, if it's not, if

162
00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:12.600
it's not ready, you know,
this answer is the only

163
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:16.250
reason that it's definitely not
a valid one. So is

164
00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:18.890
it just FID? This is
just fear, uncertainty and doubt

165
00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.470
upon the people who just
say that it doesn't feel

166
00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:25.790
right, or it's too confusing
That, and admittedly, there are

167
00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:29.510
still some browser and consistencies
and features that are not

168
00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:33.530
completely supported in every browser.
Like for example, one of

169
00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:35.600
the things that you can
do when you're spiting SVG

170
00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:38.000
is to reference an external
SPG so that you can

171
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.500
leverage browser cache and well
make subsequent page loads faster.

172
00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.480
Or plus you separate the
concerns. You have a Sprite

173
00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.450
that contains all of your
icons, for example. And whenever

174
00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:49.220
you want to edit it,
you just go into that

175
00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:51.260
Sprite and do it. But
right now, what you have

176
00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:52.970
to do is you have
to put that spot inside

177
00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:56.420
of your page because no
version of internet explorers allows

178
00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:59.780
you to reference an external
Sprite. So you have to

179
00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:02.840
either embed it in line
or use some powerful that

180
00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:06.320
people use today. It's called
SVG for everybody which provides

181
00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:08.840
fallback for IAE. So there
are some features that are

182
00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:12.770
still not supported in all
browsers, but that's not stopping

183
00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:16.190
a lot of us from
using, Okay. So let's unpack.

184
00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:18.710
Cause there was a lot
of good information in just

185
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:22.670
that, those few sentences. So
you said spreading, let's use

186
00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:25.550
the example of a toolbar.
You know, someone's going to

187
00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:29.390
make a toolbar or a
series of icons. One kind

188
00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:31.520
of developer would perhaps make
a bunch of gifts or

189
00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:34.100
PNGs and then just have
maybe 20 of them on

190
00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:36.680
the screen, right? Yeah. But
this is not a good

191
00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:41.120
idea anymore. I understand. Yeah,
It's definitely, well, there is

192
00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.580
a comment to say here,
first of all, we are,

193
00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.850
we are surprising today because
that's going to save us

194
00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:50.030
a lot of HTTP requests,
which means faster page loads.

195
00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:54.620
But with HTTP two, it's
going to make spreading basically

196
00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:58.850
obsolete because the reasons that
we usually surprise and SVG

197
00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:02.460
to save extra HTTP requests
and make, make Patriots loads

198
00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.670
faster, we're not going to
have to do that anymore

199
00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:06.770
because HTTP two is going
to take care of all

200
00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:10.850
of these things for us.
But for now, yeah, spreading

201
00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:13.070
is basically if you have
a set of icons or

202
00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:15.200
a set of images or
whatever, you combine them into

203
00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:18.710
one image and then you
serve parts of that image

204
00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:21.710
on the screen. If you're
using a PNG, you will

205
00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:25.070
have one PNG file that
contains all of your icons.

206
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:29.180
And then you would use
CSS, background positioning and scaling

207
00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:32.930
properties in CSS to only
show one part. It's kind

208
00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:37.160
of like cropping the pride
to only show one image,

209
00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.170
one icon or one image
inside of it at a

210
00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:42.980
time with SVG. It's, it's
very similar. Okay. So you're

211
00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:46.310
programmatically cropping and, and this
is a little bit of

212
00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:50.240
a hack. It's a clever
work around, isn't it? Definitely.

213
00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:52.760
Yes. Okay. But it's a
clever workaround to get around

214
00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:55.570
a limitation with an HTTP.
And as you point out

215
00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:58.870
as the underlying features get
better, as I like to

216
00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:01.870
say, the water level rises
and then, you know, everyone

217
00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:04.630
wins. So things just get
better from the bottom up.

218
00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:09.940
Okay. So then PNG spreading
makes sense to me. I

219
00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:13.540
can imagine a grid in
one PNG filled with all

220
00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:16.090
of my little icons, but
then of course, you know,

221
00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:19.030
someone gets a retina display
and then I have big

222
00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:21.130
blurry icons instead of little
ones. And then I have

223
00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:23.650
to make X two and
X four and all these

224
00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:27.700
different versions of the PNG.
Yes. A friend of mine

225
00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:29.890
said that Mobil, one of
the dirty little secrets about

226
00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:34.180
mobile website development is that
it's about 5% CSS and

227
00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:39.060
about 95% making different kinds
of PNGs. Yeah. That's actually

228
00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:41.130
why one of the reasons
why the picture element in

229
00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:44.570
HTML five words got this
huge amount of attention because

230
00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:48.060
it helps us provide responsive
images for retina screens and

231
00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:52.140
others. Well, we still, we
would still have to provide,

232
00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:54.750
for example, different like two
X, three X, four X,

233
00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:58.200
but we would have a
semantic syntax to prove to,

234
00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:02.760
to serve those images. So
just like you say, max

235
00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:05.040
width on CSS, you say
the same thing with the

236
00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:07.650
source of a picture. Yes.
You would say the same

237
00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:09.150
thing with the source of
the picture. And there are

238
00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:11.910
other options where you would
not specify a media query

239
00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:14.490
about you would, for example,
give them, give the browser

240
00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:17.220
a set of options, a
set of images. And it

241
00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:19.200
will just pick one of
them depending on the screen

242
00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:22.020
resolution. If you're not working
on screen sizes, it would

243
00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:24.900
just pick whichever one, there
are a lot of options

244
00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:28.230
it's overwhelming actually. And I
definitely don't memorize all of

245
00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:30.450
them Of course. Well, and
that, that fact that it's

246
00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:34.470
overwhelming is I think why
people look to experts and

247
00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:37.080
designers and developers and people
who write books and to

248
00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:40.410
tell us what to do,
if, if there's going to

249
00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:43.380
be a picture element with,
you know, source set and

250
00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:45.780
all these different kinds of
cool things, does that mean

251
00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:49.320
I should, as an enterprise
developer go and do PNGs

252
00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:52.080
or is it time to
do most of my graphics

253
00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:58.830
as SVGs? Well, the really
awesome thing is, well, first

254
00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:00.960
of all, again, I repeat,
you don't have to worry

255
00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:04.170
about using SVG at all.
And actually the picture element

256
00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:06.480
it's, it's one of the
elements that allows you to

257
00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:10.860
serve SVG while also providing
fallback as PNG. And even

258
00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:13.350
the fallback that you provide,
you can provide it as

259
00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:15.540
two X, three X, four
X. So you would have

260
00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:19.140
the SPG served and capable
browsers, SPG capable browsers, and

261
00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:22.110
then provide different PNGs that
a few are not lazy

262
00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:24.570
of course, to create all
of these. So you would

263
00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:26.880
have different PNGs. And if
the process does not support

264
00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:31.380
SVG, it would still have
different options, different resolutions, different

265
00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:34.590
images for different resolutions. So
it kind of gives us

266
00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:38.910
the perfect fallback mechanism, but
you want always be able

267
00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:41.100
to use the picture element
to do that because if

268
00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:43.980
you embed an SVG using
a picture element, and if

269
00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:46.050
you embed it using an
image tag or a background

270
00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:49.110
image, there are for security
reasons, you won't be able

271
00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:51.800
to script as VG. So
you want to do any

272
00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.990
kind of animation using JavaScript.
You won't be able to

273
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:56.360
do that. There are some
limitations when it comes to

274
00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:59.990
styling the SVG, because an
SVG embedded as an image,

275
00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:02.960
for example, you cannot style
it from us from a

276
00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:05.930
style sheet. That's external. The
styles have to be inside

277
00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:09.740
the SVG document. So yeah,
there are a lot of

278
00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:14.120
options. Usually what I always
tell people is you have

279
00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:17.420
different options. You have to
set your goals, you have

280
00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:19.670
a set of goals and
then you start specifying, okay.

281
00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:22.730
If I need scripting, okay,
then that's going to take

282
00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:24.560
out the image tag on
the picture element and the

283
00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:26.240
background image. I'm not going
to be able to use

284
00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:29.930
those if I need external
styles, for example, if I

285
00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:32.330
really need them, then I
think the best option would

286
00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:36.230
be to use an inline
SVG. So yeah, there are

287
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:38.360
different options. And a while
back I was working on

288
00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:41.390
a client project. The first
thing that occurred in my

289
00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:43.850
mind based on the, what,
what my client required was,

290
00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:46.370
okay. I'm just going to
use a CSS background image

291
00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:50.000
and use media queries. And
I had a set of,

292
00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:53.720
to do's or a process
to him that the SVG,

293
00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:56.810
but then based on other
features that he requested, I

294
00:15:56.810 --> 00:16:00.440
needed to use JavaScript. So
I was only left with

295
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:04.070
object and I frame, I
prefer object over I from

296
00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:06.170
any day, but then there
was a browser bug in

297
00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:09.320
Safari that I had to
cancel object and ended up

298
00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:11.180
using an iPhone, which is
something I would have never

299
00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:14.030
expected. But this happens with
SVG. You have a set

300
00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:17.450
of options, you have a
set of basically everything. You

301
00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:19.610
have to weigh things, what
you want, what you don't

302
00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:21.860
want, what you can compromise
and what you can't and

303
00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:24.670
make your choice based on
that. But do you think

304
00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:29.590
perhaps that it's, it's nuance
like that, that caused the

305
00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:31.000
people to come up to
you and say, Hey, I'm

306
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.880
worried about SVG not being
ready. Maybe it is ready,

307
00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:37.360
but it's overwhelming. Cause there's
so many options. It's definitely

308
00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:40.360
overwhelming. Yes. There are a
lot of options to do

309
00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:42.280
a lot of things. And
I still always get a

310
00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:47.500
lot of questions that for
me sometimes sound really basic.

311
00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:49.990
I mean, I've been working
with SPG for almost a

312
00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:52.240
year and I wrote a
lot about it. And so

313
00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:54.370
at some point I know
this is, this is not

314
00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:56.920
right, but at some point
I expected, okay, so we're

315
00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:58.990
done with the basics. Everybody
knows them. We can move

316
00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:02.020
forward. But then again, I
realized that no, not everyone

317
00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:03.760
is done with the basics
because a lot of people

318
00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:06.940
are still getting into SPG
now. So we have to

319
00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:09.880
keep reminding them of the
way of ways to do

320
00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:13.810
things. Plus especially there are
a lot of things that

321
00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:16.470
are still changing in SVG.
Like at the chapter of

322
00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:19.750
the smashing chapter, I was
asked to review it a

323
00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:22.090
couple of days ago, the
PDF version, which was ready.

324
00:17:22.090 --> 00:17:24.250
So I was going over
it. And then there was

325
00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:25.990
the sentence and I was
reading it and I was

326
00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:29.830
like, well, that's not entirely
true anymore. So we ended

327
00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:33.010
up switching one, one, one
sentence with a whole paragraph

328
00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:36.700
that explains a different thing.
See, this is very overwhelming

329
00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:39.580
because you know, we always
joke and say, you know,

330
00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:42.790
has Chrome 99 shipped yet?
You know, I don't even

331
00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:47.560
know what version chromosome, it's
40 something. And literally, you

332
00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:50.100
know, the little thing turned
a little turns green and

333
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:53.670
you have a new version
of Chrome, subtle things change.

334
00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:56.670
And who knows, maybe something
changed in SVG. It is

335
00:17:56.670 --> 00:18:01.040
very overwhelming. Yes it is.
But it's also very fun.

336
00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:02.900
I mean, I don't know
if I like to torture

337
00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:05.600
myself, but I really liked
this. I like having a

338
00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:07.580
lot of options, a lot
of ways to do this.

339
00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:09.740
And I think it's one
of the reasons why I

340
00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:13.520
found find as VG so
fascinating because you're not just

341
00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:16.370
limited to, okay, this is
the Holy grail. You have

342
00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:19.340
to do things this one
specific way. No, there is

343
00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:22.280
nothing like that in us.
Right. You know, and I

344
00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:24.590
realized, this is a foolish
of me as the host,

345
00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:27.680
but here we are almost
halfway through our show. And

346
00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:31.040
we haven't really talked about
what it stands for. It's

347
00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:33.740
scalable vector graphics. And I
was realizing, as you were

348
00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:37.670
saying, how people are just
still getting an understanding. I

349
00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:40.160
was actually nodding my head
and thinking, you know, I

350
00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:42.470
know a lot of people
who couldn't tell you clearly,

351
00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:44.930
if they should pick a
GIF, a PNG or a

352
00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:48.980
JPEG, and once you throw
in vectors, their brains explode,

353
00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:53.210
Well, there are certain criteria
that you can follow or

354
00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:55.490
keep in mind when you
make your choice, which image

355
00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:57.800
format to choose. If this
is your question, what should

356
00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:02.600
much from it? Well, basically
SVG is mostly suitable for,

357
00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:05.240
I was going to say
vector images, but that doesn't

358
00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:10.070
explain it really like small
illustrations icons. If you're, if

359
00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:13.520
you're talking about continuous tone
images, like photos of landscapes

360
00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:16.430
and stuff like that, a
JPEG is definitely the answer

361
00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:22.970
as Fiji. It's more suitable
for not non-continuous tone. I

362
00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:26.000
can't find the exact word
for that right now. Yeah.

363
00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:29.810
So blocks of color. No,
not even that works because

364
00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:32.030
you have gradients, you have
filter effects, you have all

365
00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:35.420
kinds of awesome graphical effects
in SVG. So if you

366
00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:39.170
have an illustration at drawing,
not a continuous stone photo,

367
00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:41.750
for example, as VG might
be the better choice. But

368
00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:43.730
then again, there are other
things to keep in mind

369
00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:46.490
that sometimes if the SVG
contains a lot of details,

370
00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:50.120
a lot of path elements,
a lot of graphical effects,

371
00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:52.190
you can end up with
a file size. That's a

372
00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:55.430
lot bigger than its PNG
counterpart. And in that case,

373
00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:58.160
choosing a PNG is, would
be a better choice because

374
00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:00.920
you always have to keep
performance. I see. So you've

375
00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:04.190
got to think about the
size as it goes over

376
00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:07.970
the wire, presumably complexity and
how difficult it is to

377
00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:10.250
parse that. I mean, I'm
sure that there's some work

378
00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:13.850
happening in the browser. You've
got to think about what

379
00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:16.400
it is you're showing. Like
I remember making a declarative

380
00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:19.040
statement and saying P and
G is for, you know,

381
00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:21.440
good for screenshots. But then
if someone puts up a

382
00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:24.320
screenshot with a picture of
a human face, I'm like,

383
00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:26.330
well, you probably should have
used a JPEG and I'll

384
00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:29.240
say, but yeah, it was
a screenshot. It depends. It

385
00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:33.200
all depends. Doesn't it? Exactly.
And I always think that,

386
00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:36.110
okay, a lot of people,
if you haven't SPG, you're

387
00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:39.980
probably, if you're working at
SVG and most cases, not

388
00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:42.380
everyone might, but in most
cases they would have a,

389
00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:44.630
they would have a graphics
editor and then they would

390
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:47.710
load the SVG into that
editor maybe to edit it

391
00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:50.740
or change something. So when
they export the SVG back

392
00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:53.740
out again, or if they
already created, if they did

393
00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:55.780
the creation inside of the
editor and then want to

394
00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:58.900
export it as SVG, they
always have an option to

395
00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:03.070
export a PNG fallback anyway.
So if all fails, they

396
00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:06.100
will always have SVG, PNG
and worst case scenario that

397
00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:08.500
can just look at the
sizes. And if there's a

398
00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:11.050
huge difference between the SVG
and PNG and SVG is

399
00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:14.640
too big, then just choose
PNG. Now, one of the

400
00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:18.840
things that I think for
me pushes me towards using

401
00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:21.600
SVG more than using an
image or using a PNG,

402
00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:24.300
is that correct me if
I'm wrong? Don't they live

403
00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:27.000
somehow in the Dom? I
mean, they aren't just like

404
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.590
an Island, like an images.
Yes. SVG SVG is viral.

405
00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:36.180
Nature is amazing. It's an
image format, but it's also

406
00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:39.180
a document format. So if
you have an SVG in

407
00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:43.080
line SVG code inside of
an HTML page, it practically

408
00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:48.180
acts as an eye frame.
Yes You would have. You

409
00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:51.690
would have this document inside
of the document. Sounds a

410
00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:54.480
little complicated or a little,
I would freak out if

411
00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:57.270
someone's had that. Well, because
in the old days we

412
00:21:57.270 --> 00:22:01.560
would say in bed and
the, the, the object embedded

413
00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:05.130
within the document was usually
a whole other universe. And

414
00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:10.530
switching between universes was painful.
Well, I'm not really sure

415
00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:12.900
what the, what the code
looked like when you used

416
00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:17.640
embed, but the SVG code
is generally speaking, human readable.

417
00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:19.740
Now there are some exceptions.
If you are working with

418
00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:23.040
SVG filters, the F E
column matrix F E composite,

419
00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:26.310
whatever, there are some terms.
And for example, there's also

420
00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:30.090
P path data. These are
definitely not human readable, but

421
00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:32.760
most of it, most of
it, the tags, the elements

422
00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:35.890
you have circle, you have
circ, which stands for circle

423
00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:39.390
erect, not actually, there are
circle and direct. You have

424
00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:41.940
path. These are all elements
you have used. You have

425
00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:45.690
G which means group. You
have symbol. All of these

426
00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:47.670
elements are human readable. And
if you come from an

427
00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:50.130
HTML CSS background, if you
are, if you already know

428
00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:53.610
your way around CSS and
HTML learning, SVG the curve,

429
00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:55.920
it's, it's, it's not going
to take a lot of

430
00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:59.360
time. I can go into
that. Okay. So if it

431
00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:02.040
is, it's a document of
its own, I can say,

432
00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:05.370
you know, image source equals
and treat it like an

433
00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:07.320
image, but then I, it
doesn't really live in my

434
00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:11.520
dorm and I can't interact
with CSS, right? Yeah. You

435
00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:14.520
can. Yeah. Depends on interaction.
If you, if you're, if

436
00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:16.590
you're only talking about styling,
then you can style it.

437
00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:18.360
If the styles are inside
of the SVG, you can

438
00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:21.150
even animate it. You can
have CSS animations inside of

439
00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:24.120
the SVG document and they
would still play when you

440
00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:26.910
embedded as an image. But
if you have our interactions

441
00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:30.030
and the hover or any
kind of JavaScript, our interactions

442
00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:32.550
are not going to work
and SVG embedded as an

443
00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:35.670
image, but they can work
with other embedded. And you've

444
00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:39.480
got a really great series
of slides of it, slides.com.

445
00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:42.690
And it goes over the
different embedding techniques, whether it

446
00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:46.640
be image using as a
background image, object I-frame. And

447
00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:48.770
I would encourage everyone to
check that out. And I'll

448
00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:50.830
put a link in the,
in the show notes, There

449
00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:53.800
are slides about the pros
and cons of each techniques.

450
00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:57.370
I don't know if I
don't think I've posted slides

451
00:23:57.370 --> 00:24:00.220
about including the different fallback
tech. No, that was one

452
00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:03.640
of my workshop actually, but
at some point, and then

453
00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:06.250
there's also my articles that
they can check out. There's

454
00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:09.400
also, CSS-Tricks posts a lot
of awesome SVG articles as

455
00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:12.430
well. So there are a
lot of resources out there.

456
00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:16.660
If you want to learn
SPG, there's practically nothing standing

457
00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:19.900
in your way, unless it's
you, maybe you're still not

458
00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:21.400
very sure about it. Or
if you're working in a

459
00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:24.580
company and I don't know,
I've never worked in a

460
00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:27.730
company, so I don't know
what, what could possibly cause

461
00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:30.220
that, but I can understand
if some people just can't

462
00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:32.950
maybe, maybe they want to
try it out, but, Well,

463
00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:36.130
I think also the bosses
and people who kind of

464
00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:39.610
understand what's going on, we'll
hear about something like, Hey,

465
00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:42.400
what about icon fonts? Those
are great. Let's do all

466
00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:46.090
of our icons in icon
fonts. And then we, so

467
00:24:46.090 --> 00:24:47.620
then we have to go
and ask an expert like

468
00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:50.560
you, why should I use
SVG icons and not icon

469
00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:54.670
funds? Well, I, I don't
have all of the reasons

470
00:24:54.670 --> 00:24:57.250
it's out of my head.
No, but there's this, if

471
00:24:57.250 --> 00:25:03.850
you Google SVG icons cage
match on CSS-Tricks, Chris wrote

472
00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:09.430
this big article, it contains
a cage match comparison between

473
00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:12.370
icon fonts and SVG and
SVG wins hands down. I

474
00:25:12.370 --> 00:25:15.580
think the, the only advantage
to icon fonts that I

475
00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:18.610
can remember is that support
goes back to <inaudible>, but

476
00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.370
we really shouldn't be supporting
Isaacs anymore. I know that

477
00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:23.860
for some people that's not
an option, but we really

478
00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:28.690
should stop. So SPG wins
hands down, especially with the

479
00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:31.660
fallback technique. Well, so there,
I think that for me,

480
00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:35.680
the fact that they're animatable
and interactive, you know, things

481
00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:38.650
like hover effects and pushing,
you know, push button effects,

482
00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:43.630
things like that makes SPG
stand out, certainly as icons,

483
00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:46.990
they're going to be, you
know, consistent across browsers. And

484
00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:49.000
I've had a lot of
trouble with icon fonts being

485
00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:52.150
a little bit inconsistent from
project browser. Yes. And they

486
00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:55.990
look great everywhere. And there's
also something to be said,

487
00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:59.020
wouldn't you say about the
semantics of, of these things

488
00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:03.520
and the SVGs are more
semantic. Yes they are. Yeah.

489
00:26:04.090 --> 00:26:06.850
Cause if you're, if you're
marking up an image, you're

490
00:26:06.850 --> 00:26:09.640
marking it up up as
an image instead of using

491
00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:12.490
an empty span element, for
example, or a div, you

492
00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:15.190
have an image. And every
element inside of that SVG,

493
00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:18.910
even text text is marked
up as text. There are

494
00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:22.240
some exceptions, if you want
to change that yourself. But

495
00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:27.580
text is text is it's
100% crawlable searchable, selectable accessible.

496
00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:32.290
It even comes with its
own accessibility elements and Arya

497
00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:36.550
labels. It's 100% accessible. So
it's perfect. Perfect. One of

498
00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:40.330
my favorite use cases for
SVG is a graphical text.

499
00:26:40.450 --> 00:26:42.370
If you have a text
and you haven't, if you

500
00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:44.820
want to apply it, some
kind of graphical effect to

501
00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:47.910
it, you can do that
in SVG while still maintaining

502
00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:51.600
the accessibility and searchability and
selectability of the text. There

503
00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:53.970
was actually an article that
was written on smashing magazine

504
00:26:53.970 --> 00:26:57.480
yesterday. That talks just about
the different effects that you

505
00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:01.320
can create. And it notes,
it points out that at

506
00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:03.270
the beginning of the article
that, okay, don't worry about

507
00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:05.940
it as we will still
be searchable. This is fascinating.

508
00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:09.370
Ah, so you're saying that
if I make a, a

509
00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:11.540
letter S and I make
a picture of it, that's

510
00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:14.540
not accessible in any way,
but if I make an

511
00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:16.580
S and that S lives
as a byte and an

512
00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:19.610
SVG, I can then stretch
it, move it, apply filters,

513
00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:23.870
go nuts. Yes. And now
if you have a picture

514
00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:26.750
of an S then if
you're using the alt attribute

515
00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:28.910
on that picture, well, then
you can provide some kind

516
00:27:28.910 --> 00:27:32.480
of fallback for Screenagers. Yeah.
But it's not, it's not

517
00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:34.550
going to be selectable you,
if you want to change

518
00:27:34.550 --> 00:27:35.780
it, you're going to have
to create a whole new,

519
00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:38.870
different image. You can't just
jump into the image, the

520
00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:41.120
code of that image and
edit it. You can't do

521
00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:43.820
that with a JPEG or
PNG, for example, but with

522
00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:47.060
SVG, you have total control
over the contents of the

523
00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:53.060
image. Okay. And then with
any SVG, a document or

524
00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:57.140
object, I can apply these
filters, like lighting sources and

525
00:27:57.140 --> 00:27:58.940
things like that, and really
change the way that they

526
00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:02.600
look. Yes. There are a
lot of options. I haven't,

527
00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:06.050
I haven't had the time,
unfortunately, to dig into SVG

528
00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:09.380
filters as much as I
want to, but hopefully at

529
00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:14.930
some point. Yeah. And I
understand that with CSS, it's

530
00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:18.350
like, people will say, don't
do that animation in Java

531
00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:21.050
and jQuery do it in
CSS because it's going to

532
00:28:21.050 --> 00:28:24.050
be hardware accelerated. Does SVG
have a similar kind of

533
00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:27.260
situation? Is the browser using
SVG more efficiently than other

534
00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:32.270
techniques? Well, it depends. I
think I read recently that

535
00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:39.380
smell synchronized multimedia. It's really
hard. S S M I

536
00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:43.070
L S M I L.
Yeah. Synchronized multimedia integration language.

537
00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:46.580
Yeah. I think it's officially
pronounced as a smile, but

538
00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:48.760
I don't understand what pronounce
it smile without the E

539
00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:51.350
at the end. Yeah. So
smell. I think I read

540
00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:54.290
that smell performs really well,
but smells not supported in

541
00:28:54.290 --> 00:28:56.630
any version of an index
internet Explorer. There are no

542
00:28:56.630 --> 00:29:01.070
plans to support it. It's
going to be deprecated in

543
00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:04.520
Chrome as well. So I'm
not really sure about its

544
00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:09.140
future anymore. CSS animations on
SVG elements are currently not

545
00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:12.830
hardware accelerated and most browsers.
Unfortunately, this is still work

546
00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:16.250
in progress. Something that we
still have. Well, we have

547
00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:20.150
to wait for browsers to
improve on. I think there

548
00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:24.440
is Firefox Firefox. The performance
of S CSS animations on

549
00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:27.560
SVG is not, is not
bad. I think it's also

550
00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:31.820
getting better in Microsoft edge,
but Chrome is still, if

551
00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:35.180
you have a lot of
complex animations, they can be

552
00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:40.520
well, not very performant on.
Yeah. I seem to remember

553
00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:43.270
that Chrome is, you know,
is always trying to push

554
00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:46.480
for both SVG and CSS
to be accelerated. I know

555
00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:50.500
I nine was the first
browser that added hardware acceleration

556
00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:54.070
on SVG. So it seems
like SVG is really kind

557
00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:57.010
of, of the web and
it is, it's not a

558
00:29:57.010 --> 00:30:01.030
bolt on technology. It really
is fundamental. It's would you

559
00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:03.730
say it's when someone says
HTML five, which is such

560
00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:09.930
an overloaded term SVGs in
there? Isn't it? Well, technically

561
00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:12.870
I think, I don't know
if some people might agree

562
00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:15.060
or disagree on this if
it's in there or not,

563
00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:17.880
but for me, yeah. I
think it's part of the

564
00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:22.080
suit. Hmm. Yeah. I think
that if, if I'm saying

565
00:30:22.410 --> 00:30:25.710
HTML five, the there's an
implicit, well, he means CSS

566
00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:29.340
three and HTML five and
SVG and you know, modern

567
00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:32.370
browsers on the edge, you
know, to make a bad

568
00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:34.740
pond. Yeah. I can already
hear a lot of people

569
00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:38.100
going over the technicalities and
bill SVG is not HTML.

570
00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:40.590
So it cannot be a
part of HTML five technically.

571
00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:43.950
Yeah. You know, but when,
when a boss or a

572
00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:47.040
suit or a customer comes
to you and says, I

573
00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:50.400
want my website to use
HTML five, you don't think

574
00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:52.650
that they really mean just
the elements. Right? They mean

575
00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:56.100
they want it to be
a modern evergreen environment. Yeah.

576
00:30:56.550 --> 00:31:01.110
Definitely an SVG would fit
perfectly in that. <inaudible>. And

577
00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:05.670
can I use SVG and
do a responsive design? I

578
00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:10.110
can do it on small
browsers. Absolutely. Yes, definitely. There's

579
00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:13.680
no question in that. And
does that mean that I'm

580
00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:17.220
resizing it dynamically? Or what,
what are the interactions do

581
00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:20.280
I plug in different SVGs
based on what's happening with

582
00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:23.370
my browser size? No, you
don't have to do that.

583
00:31:23.370 --> 00:31:25.590
You can make it fluid,
just like any other image

584
00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:28.170
format for, if you give
it, for example, with 100%

585
00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:31.020
and then the page with
changes, it's going to change

586
00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:34.590
accordingly. Now, in some cases
I would recommend to use

587
00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:38.970
different SPGs. If the SV
like a while back, my

588
00:31:38.970 --> 00:31:42.090
latest article was about using
one of SVGs, most powerful

589
00:31:42.090 --> 00:31:45.390
attributes it's called view box.
You can use that to

590
00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:48.300
crop the SVG to different,
to show, to only show

591
00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:52.290
different parts of it. So
you can do art direction.

592
00:31:52.290 --> 00:31:54.690
You can art direct SVG
and only show different parts

593
00:31:54.690 --> 00:31:59.640
of that SVG on different
screen sizes, which works incredibly

594
00:32:00.090 --> 00:32:03.960
really, really well. But again,
in the same client project

595
00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:07.050
that I mentioned earlier, there
was this big header image

596
00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:09.180
and he wanted to show
different parts of that image

597
00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:10.860
on different screen sizes. So
the first thing that I

598
00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:12.870
did was that, and it
literally took me less than

599
00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:15.720
a minute. I art directed
the SVG using the view

600
00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:19.200
box attribute, but the SVG
was 200 kilobytes in size.

601
00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:21.930
And even after optimizing it,
which is something everyone should

602
00:32:21.930 --> 00:32:25.950
do, if you're using SVG,
always optimize them. After optimizing

603
00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:27.930
it, I was able to
slash the file size down

604
00:32:27.930 --> 00:32:31.620
to a hundred plus kilobytes,
but that, that was still

605
00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:34.830
too much to serve on,
on smaller screens. So we

606
00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:37.860
ended up using three different
SVG images and serve the

607
00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:41.390
one for mobile, the one
for medium. Well, it's still

608
00:32:41.390 --> 00:32:45.260
mobile, but for example, small
sizes, medium sizes, bigger sizes.

609
00:32:46.330 --> 00:32:48.250
Yeah. This blog post that
you did was just last

610
00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:50.830
week on the on, and
it was a really great

611
00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:54.610
post because you call out
how fundamentally useful it is

612
00:32:54.610 --> 00:32:57.490
to be able to dynamically
kind of crop. And like

613
00:32:57.490 --> 00:33:00.830
you say, art direct, you
know, when you imagine the

614
00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:04.150
director holding their fingers up
like an L and like,

615
00:33:04.150 --> 00:33:06.010
pretending that they are the
camera and saying, well, I

616
00:33:06.010 --> 00:33:07.750
want to crop here and
then pan out and then

617
00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:10.570
zoom. But then you point
out later in the post,

618
00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:13.330
we can't do this in
CSS. This is an SVG

619
00:33:13.330 --> 00:33:18.580
specific thing. Yes. A lot
of right now today, there

620
00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:21.820
are, there's a bunch of
SPG attributes that we can

621
00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:24.280
set in CSS simply because
they are available as CSS

622
00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:27.490
properties and as VG too,
there are a lot of

623
00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:30.610
extra attributes that are going
to be added, which is

624
00:33:30.610 --> 00:33:32.920
a huge improvement. But one
of the things that I

625
00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:35.650
requested based on that article
and based on the use

626
00:33:35.650 --> 00:33:38.080
case in that article was
to get a view box

627
00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:40.780
property as well. So I
really hope we do get

628
00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:43.450
it because we can still
do it. We can still

629
00:33:43.510 --> 00:33:46.630
our direct SVG with a
view box viewbooks attribute using

630
00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:50.500
JavaScript for example, but it
would be a lot easier.

631
00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:52.840
And, you know, we just,
why would I want it?

632
00:33:52.870 --> 00:33:55.420
Why would I need, why
do I have to use

633
00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:58.990
JavaScript to just change the
view box of an SVG

634
00:33:58.990 --> 00:34:00.910
when I would be able
to do it in CSS,

635
00:34:00.910 --> 00:34:04.480
inside of a media query?
So we have, we have

636
00:34:06.790 --> 00:34:10.420
not the right, well, we
can, we can suggest features

637
00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:12.610
to the SVG working group.
And if you have a

638
00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:15.790
practical use case, they usually
listen. They are really nice

639
00:34:15.790 --> 00:34:18.430
people. And like I said,
if you have a practical

640
00:34:18.430 --> 00:34:20.860
use case, you can send
a proposal or an idea,

641
00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:23.560
for example, and then there
would think it through if

642
00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:26.320
it's possible, if it's not
possible and it can end

643
00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:29.740
up in a specification and
then the specification could end

644
00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:34.060
up implemented, we can change
this, but we just have

645
00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:38.340
to push it forward. Yeah,
absolutely. Do you now use,

646
00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:42.190
certainly write some amazing blog
posts that have extremely compelling

647
00:34:42.490 --> 00:34:46.600
and clear. They're almost specifications
with animations. They're really a

648
00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:48.760
lot more fun, frankly. It's
more fun to read your

649
00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:52.270
blog than it is to
read the specifications. Did you,

650
00:34:52.450 --> 00:34:56.320
do you just point the
W3C people to your posts

651
00:34:56.350 --> 00:34:59.680
or do you also go
and write a specification that

652
00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:01.390
they, the way that they
want or proposal the way

653
00:35:01.390 --> 00:35:06.370
the working group wants For
the view box? The view

654
00:35:06.370 --> 00:35:09.490
box property? I was, I
was thinking that I would

655
00:35:09.490 --> 00:35:11.800
write the blog post and
then, then I would suggest

656
00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:14.110
the feature and then link
to my blog post, which

657
00:35:14.110 --> 00:35:17.230
would be like an elaboration
of the use case and

658
00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:19.450
everything. But it turned out
that there was already a

659
00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:23.140
proposal. It goes, I think
two or three years back.

660
00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:25.300
So the proposal is already
there. So I didn't do

661
00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:28.960
anything about this in particular.
Well, that's great though, because

662
00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:33.190
that means great minds think
alike. Yeah. I think our,

663
00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:35.980
as a friend of mine
always says our full seldom

664
00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:40.830
differ well, Either way. I
think that I, I want

665
00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:41.700
to know that I want
you to know that I

666
00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:46.830
appreciate you. I appreciate your
writing. And it's extremely accessible

667
00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:49.950
to, to overload the word
accessible because all of this

668
00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:53.850
is so overwhelming. And when,
when there are really great

669
00:35:53.850 --> 00:35:56.970
blog posts and really great
books and resources that are

670
00:35:56.970 --> 00:36:00.360
made available for free, you're
giving this to us, you

671
00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:02.190
know, and this is really
what the best of the

672
00:36:02.190 --> 00:36:05.240
web is. Thank you. Well,
I love doing it. I

673
00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:08.660
love, I've always had this
knack for, for breaking complex

674
00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:11.810
subjects down into simpler ones.
I used to do when

675
00:36:11.810 --> 00:36:14.000
I was, when I was
in school, when I was

676
00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:16.610
in high school, when I
was in college, I always

677
00:36:16.610 --> 00:36:19.550
loved that. Like, there were
always these hard subjects that

678
00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:21.530
not everyone in the class
understood. And I was the

679
00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:25.550
kind that always asked questions
always. So I ended up,

680
00:36:25.610 --> 00:36:29.060
for example, really getting the
idea, but a lot of

681
00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:32.360
others, other colleagues didn't, so
we used to gather up

682
00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:34.010
on breaks and stuff and
I would explain it to

683
00:36:34.010 --> 00:36:37.730
them and it always made
me feel amazing. I think

684
00:36:37.730 --> 00:36:41.060
this is, this is, I
don't even know how to

685
00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:43.280
describe it. I just really
loved doing it. I think

686
00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:46.130
you found your, you found
your calling. Yeah. That might

687
00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:49.130
be it. Yeah. Yeah. Well,
I appreciate you coming on

688
00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:52.280
the show today. Thank you.
Thanks for having me. Thank

689
00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:54.920
