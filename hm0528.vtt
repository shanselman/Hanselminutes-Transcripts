It's Hansel minutes, our weekly

9
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.670
discussion with web developer and
technologists, Scott Hanselman. This is

10
00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.100
Lawrence Ryan announcing show number 532.
In this episode, Scott talks

11
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.210
with Oz du Solei about
data literacy and the usefulness

12
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:13.710
of Excel. Hi, this is
Scott Hanselman. This is another

13
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.070
episode of Hanselminutes today. We're
talking with Oz du chalet.

14
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.580
He owns data scopic and
he's the author of gorilla

15
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.950
data analysis using Microsoft Excel.
Excel. Excel is like the

16
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.410
hidden data tool that everybody
uses, but nobody wants to

17
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.220
admit it. Yes, that's true.
So you believe that Excel

18
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.230
is getting a bad rap
and people need to step

19
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.200
up and recognize that Excel
is where it's at. I

20
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.500
think so. You know, I'm
going to hackathons as an

21
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.270
Excel developer and there is
no line for Excel developer.

22
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.410
They've got the Jason and
the a C sharp and

23
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:54.720
everything else, but where's Excel
everywhere, but not only this

24
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.930
list, but you're, you know,
you've been an Excel MVP

25
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.660
now two years in a
row. So somebody recognizes that

26
00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.000
there's value in Excel, but
you think that it's a

27
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.560
data. It's a really good
data tool. It is. Yes,

28
00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.640
it is a data tool.
Yes. So where's that line.

29
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.110
I mean, I think that
there's a, there's a class

30
00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.720
of people out there that
have data in big enterprise

31
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.140
databases and they have huge
CRM systems and they got

32
00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.730
folks with, you know, small,
small systems, where does Excel

33
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.490
fit? And when does, when
does in data, when is

34
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:34.230
Excel as database appropriate? Well,
Excel users, Excel, power users.

35
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:41.400
We straddle a line between,
you know, hardcore defined it

36
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.560
and people who do the
work. So somebody who does

37
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.920
sequel are they build apps,
that's their profession. But then

38
00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.520
you have somebody who's a
grant writer at a nonprofit

39
00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.280
or a customer service rep.
Like I was our commissions

40
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:06.160
Analyst, you know, you know,
our job is grant writer

41
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:16.720
not deal SQL colder. So
Excel straddles those worlds because

42
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.870
we have to be kind
of it kind of tech,

43
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.050
but also kind of in
the business side of things.

44
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.910
So when the grant writer
can't get data in such

45
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:33.310
a way to show a
foundation where their $30,000 grant

46
00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.360
went, we've got to heal.
Okay, why can't you get

47
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.870
the data? Okay. Because they're
sprinkled between different databases, it's

48
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.410
on different computers, it's on
different spreadsheets. And how do

49
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.780
we sweep all of this
stuff together so that you

50
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:52.480
can say something to this
foundation, the part time, it

51
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.780
person they're not involved with
that. And I had a

52
00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.710
conversation with somebody recently where
he said that their it

53
00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:04.800
person, their job is to
keep the website up. Okay.

54
00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.470
So that was in their
mind. It people are, you

55
00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:13.020
know, operations. Yes. Yes. Not
help us show where that

56
00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:18.390
30,000 bucks went. I gotcha.
So when you think of

57
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.720
like a Microsoft office power
user, this is a person

58
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.880
that has as much the
business in mind as they

59
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.990
have the technology. Yes. Yes.
And it's been exciting. I've

60
00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.440
I have a friend who's
an it director. And she

61
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.310
says that, yeah, they don't
see a lot of the

62
00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.110
consequences of, you know, when
data's bad or when it

63
00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.950
takes forever to get a
report fixed, or you just

64
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.650
find out that a report
is messed up. They don't

65
00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.620
see, you know, I've been
on the phone with people

66
00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.130
who were in tears or
they were mad about something.

67
00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.530
And then I've got to
go to an it person

68
00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.730
who they don't take calls
from the public. They don't

69
00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:03.900
understand enough about the business
to understand what went wrong.

70
00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.010
You know, what happens when
somebody has eight profiles in

71
00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:13.560
the database? Well, I within
say, you know, a few

72
00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.960
hours can get all of
that stuff out of the

73
00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:21.450
database, merge those eight profiles
in Excel and get this

74
00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:25.080
person straightened out. But if
I had to rely on

75
00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.110
it to do it, then
it's got to be prioritized

76
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.210
and has got to go
through all kinds of things.

77
00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:34.050
And then, you know, I've
had them say, you know,

78
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:39.150
is, is month end. And
I've got to support accounting

79
00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.360
to close last month. And
then I've got this thing

80
00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.080
to do for the CFO
and the CEO. And then

81
00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.450
I can get back to
helping you with your one

82
00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:53.310
person in their professional license.
You're also describing though Excel

83
00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:57.390
as like a business dashboard.
You're building these, these aggregating

84
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.160
where you're pulling data from
multiple locations with the business

85
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.090
person in mind, we can
go and buy these dashboards.

86
00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:07.250
Can't really, you know, aren't
there whole industries around building

87
00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:12.400
these dashboards. Well, there's a
lot of times this stuff

88
00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.330
is ad hoc. This is
where it helps to, you

89
00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.630
know, understand the business and
be really in touch with

90
00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:23.320
the consequences. Because a lot
of times this stuff is

91
00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:27.310
one time I see, but
you got to be familiar

92
00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:32.170
with the, with the business
and the data enough to

93
00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:34.720
know what to pull and
what needs to be put

94
00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:40.840
together and where to start
looking for problems You've said

95
00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.390
on your blog. And I've
seen videos with you saying

96
00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:45.250
that one of the biggest
problems that you find is

97
00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.040
data validation. Like you're known
as like the data cleaner

98
00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:51.190
people did garbage in garbage
out is really like a

99
00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:52.810
part of what you're, what
you have to deal with

100
00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:56.350
every day. So data validation
is like super important. And

101
00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:59.410
do you find Excel to
be good at that? Yeah.

102
00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:03.610
Yeah. Well now the data
validation, that's the piece that

103
00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:09.010
helps crap from going in.
I see. So it's not

104
00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:11.650
crap at all. If you
catch it before someone messes

105
00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:18.250
it up, Right? So, you
know, data validation like birthdays,

106
00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:22.090
you know, how do you
prevent somebody from accidentally putting

107
00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:25.480
today's date into a field?
You know, and saying, I

108
00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:29.950
was born today. Now, you
know, those kinds of problems.

109
00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:33.880
And I've pointed out that
when those things happen, I

110
00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:37.690
am expensive to fix that
stuff. So if you can

111
00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:41.440
put some validation on the
front end, that would help

112
00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:45.190
a lot. And then your
analysis would be better. You

113
00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:51.220
know, you minimize the cleaning,
but then yeah, I've gotten

114
00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:56.020
a reputation for fighting for
cleaning data, because all this

115
00:07:56.020 --> 00:08:01.750
stuff about big data and
dashboards and data visualization, it's

116
00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:06.010
no good if the data's
not clean or if you

117
00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:09.850
can't clean it, some, you
know, that's a skill that

118
00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:12.850
few people have because people
do learn to do the

119
00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:17.710
analysis and build the dashboards
and everything, but their instructor

120
00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:21.370
or whomever will show up
with clean data for them

121
00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:26.440
to work with. You've also
on your blog, your extra

122
00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:29.650
whole section on data integrity.
One of the blog posts

123
00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:31.450
that you did that I
like was about the, you

124
00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:34.660
call it the octopus spreadsheet.
And I think it's like

125
00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:37.630
people who think they're slick
with Excel, and then suddenly

126
00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:40.240
they go from me having,
you know, a sheet to

127
00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:43.690
multiple sheets linked to other
workbooks. They've got, you know,

128
00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:46.900
all of this pulling from
multiple places. Like I know

129
00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.330
that you advocate for using
Excel for maybe a lot

130
00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:52.660
more stuff than people than
people typically do. Right. But

131
00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:56.310
how complicated is too complicated?
Like what's the Excel spreadsheet

132
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:58.970
that use, you know, how
big is too big? Well,

133
00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:06.200
I would say that layout
is critical. That's more critical

134
00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:12.770
than knowing fancy formulas because
you'll have something that starts

135
00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:18.050
out with, you know, we
just need to count orders

136
00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.390
so that we can do
a week over week count

137
00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:23.960
of orders. And then over
years, it turns into a

138
00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:28.700
forecasting thing that also has
alerts in it for when

139
00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:32.480
we need to order more
stuff. So now you got

140
00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:35.390
this big old octopus with
all these tentacles on it,

141
00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:39.320
and it gets to be
a problem when you're copying

142
00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:44.390
and pasting things in multiple
places. Because now you have

143
00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:50.450
an error location right up
a potential for errors because

144
00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:53.990
you know, you're copy and
paste could be bad, or

145
00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:58.160
you get the same information,
needs to be pasted in

146
00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.590
four different places. And you
paste them in two and

147
00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:03.200
have to go to the
bathroom and come back and

148
00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.630
then go to lunch and
then forget to pace the

149
00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:08.360
other two. Right. So it
sounds like you advocate for

150
00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:12.130
some data normalization and avoiding
duplication, if at all, all

151
00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:14.600
costs, there should be one
place where that data exists.

152
00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:17.510
Right. And think about the
flow of it, you know?

153
00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:20.990
Yeah. Whereas this data have
to get to, and then

154
00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:27.290
really minimize all that manual
stuff. I think most people,

155
00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:30.830
and I think myself as
well know, just enough Excel

156
00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:34.220
to be dangerous. You know,
I think when, when I

157
00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:36.620
think of Excel, I think
maybe people who are listening,

158
00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:39.290
they think, all right, we'll
have a list of stuff.

159
00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:42.560
I have columns. And then
maybe I have some, and

160
00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:46.010
then maybe we have subtotals.
And I think people are

161
00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:48.350
willing to put that on
their resume and say, yeah,

162
00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:52.790
I know Excel. But if
you really know Excel, you're

163
00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:55.760
going to start learning about
some of the formulas and

164
00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:58.040
like the top functions that
you need to know. That's

165
00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:01.310
way beyond just if statements.
Yes. Yes. That's when you

166
00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:05.900
get into somebody who's really
using Excel, Do you think

167
00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:08.900
that the programmers that are
listening, like the types of

168
00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:12.620
folks that usually listen to
my show are programmers, do

169
00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:15.290
you think that they're missing
out having Excel in their,

170
00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:18.020
in their toolkit? They might
be a little snobbish and

171
00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:21.080
think, Oh, you know, Excel,
I'll write that in C

172
00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:26.060
sharp. I think so. But
the thing is, you know,

173
00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:28.370
I had a lot of
arguments with people back in

174
00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:31.160
Chicago. You know, I've been
in Portland for almost two

175
00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:35.570
years and the reception has
been warmer. You know, I

176
00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:39.980
had a conversation with say,
Portia Burton. She's one of

177
00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:41.900
the first few people I
met when I got to

178
00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:45.530
got to Portland. And she
said, you know what? We

179
00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:48.590
leave the Excel users out
of all these tech and

180
00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:56.350
it conversations. And she saw
that clients constantly send them

181
00:11:56.350 --> 00:12:03.220
spreadsheets. You know, we can
talk about AR and all

182
00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:06.700
of these different, you know,
script and things would that

183
00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:11.260
professional developers use, but what's
the client doing, sending them

184
00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:17.920
spreadsheets, sending them octopus spreadsheets.
And I did a presentation

185
00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:20.860
a few months ago for
some data scientists that showed

186
00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:25.150
because of the conversation. There
was, you know, we get

187
00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:27.580
these spreadsheets, we bring the
data in and there is

188
00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:30.700
something going on and then
I'll write a Python script

189
00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:33.580
to do some kind of
cleansing. And so I was

190
00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:37.270
able to show them, okay,
there's power query that is

191
00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:41.080
set up to do things
like, you know, parse text,

192
00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:46.570
merged, text on pivot things
do. Now it can do

193
00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:52.630
joins. And anti joins is
so there's so much that

194
00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:56.440
can be done if you
get a client's data and

195
00:12:56.440 --> 00:13:00.010
it has to be cleansed,
you might not have to

196
00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:02.740
write some Python thing in
order to do it. There

197
00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:07.000
might be something in Excel
already. And so I was

198
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.050
offering that as is just
another tool. That's all, I'm

199
00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:14.560
not saying that Excel is
better than R our Python

200
00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:17.610
at all, by any means,
but it's a Tool. It's

201
00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:20.880
a tool that we are
maybe overlooking. Yeah. And when

202
00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:24.150
we were talking earlier, before
the show, you made a

203
00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:27.540
really interesting statement that kind
of, kind of blew my

204
00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:30.480
mind a little bit and
got me thinking maybe I

205
00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:34.770
am not thinking about Excel
as a prototyping tool. Like

206
00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.690
you've, you've gone to people
who say, we're going to

207
00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:38.340
build an app. We're going
to make this great app.

208
00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:40.920
It's gonna be wonderful. And,
you know, you can prototype

209
00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:43.230
on paper, you can prototype
in the language you're going

210
00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:46.350
to write in, but you've
written like full business applications

211
00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:49.890
in Excel and say, make
it behave exactly like this.

212
00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:52.620
And then Excel is the
specification that you have given

213
00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:58.500
to the developers. Yep, Exactly.
Because I would come in

214
00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:03.150
cheaper than somebody who is
a professional developer, right. And

215
00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:08.760
my client, they might know
financial management and they have

216
00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:15.660
an idea for an app.
So he would have me

217
00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:20.520
build a tool that calculates
in person did something on

218
00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:23.430
this date and we gotta
prorate this cost. And if

219
00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:26.220
they do this and if
they do that, and then

220
00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:28.530
I want to have this
report come out and I

221
00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:31.680
want the report to bring
in this type of information

222
00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:34.350
and look this way and
use our logo over here.

223
00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:37.080
I assume you have to
iterate over this multiple times,

224
00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:38.760
you're going back and forth
with the client all the

225
00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:41.070
time. Yes. Yes. And if
he was doing that with

226
00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:44.970
his development team, that'd be
a lot of money. So

227
00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:48.060
he saw it as cheaper
to go back and forth

228
00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:51.500
with me to get it
right, so that he then

229
00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:55.580
take it to his developers.
And he said that not

230
00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:58.280
only is it cheaper for
him to have me as

231
00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:03.230
a step prototype and an
Excel, but, and he talks

232
00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:06.200
my language. He may not
be able to write the

233
00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:09.950
formulas that I write, but
he can look at them

234
00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:13.670
and he can put in
scenarios to see if what

235
00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:18.380
he expects comes out is
actually what comes out. And

236
00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:21.590
once we have it all
locked down, then he can

237
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:24.590
turn it over to the
developers whose language he does

238
00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:27.970
not speak Right now. Are
you collaborating with them in

239
00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:30.850
the sense that you're, he's
making changes to the spreadsheet

240
00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:35.020
himself, like is Excel potentially
a collaboration tool where business

241
00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:37.120
users can actually make the
changes and send it back

242
00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:41.770
and say, no, no, like
this. Yeah, yeah, yeah. At

243
00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:44.680
least, you know, the way
that we will work. And

244
00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:47.560
it was just, you know,
just save it and email

245
00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:51.190
it or put it in
a shared folder. Yeah. I

246
00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:55.480
think that developers tend to
exclude the business users maybe

247
00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:57.670
on accident. And it's like,
well, we're going to put

248
00:15:57.670 --> 00:15:59.740
that in, get, and then
get hub. And it's going

249
00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:02.140
to be written in our
past, you know, or Python

250
00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:05.380
or whatever. And then suddenly,
without us realizing it, we

251
00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:09.130
have locked up the knowledge
for the very person that

252
00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:13.090
we are working for. And
someone might be listening and

253
00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:15.190
going, Oh, you know, they
may stick their nose up.

254
00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:18.550
Like, Oh man, he is
emailing spreadsheets around, how is

255
00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:21.940
that a solution? But in
a one on one relationship

256
00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:25.330
solving a real business problem,
like that's, you know, you

257
00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:26.860
could say, it's sloppy. You
could say it's the height

258
00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:30.370
of pragmatism to solve the
problem that way. Right? Yeah.

259
00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:33.580
Yeah. It can go either
way, you know, and then

260
00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:37.690
you do have to start
thinking about version control, definitely

261
00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:41.380
get, get those old things
out of the way. But

262
00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:44.470
then, you know, I've developed
a practice of having an

263
00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:47.200
archive folder, you know, in
case we do have to

264
00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:52.030
go back because sometimes we'll
say, okay, the, that part

265
00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:55.270
that we were working on
last week is working better

266
00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:57.610
than the one now. Okay.
So we'll go back to

267
00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:00.880
it, but at least it's
out of the way, you

268
00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:06.400
know, I'm sure Excel doesn't
exactly lend itself to source

269
00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:09.490
control. Anyway, it really is
just about previous versions and

270
00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:14.500
keeping, keeping track of what
you've done. I've also noticed

271
00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:16.420
that you have, you have
a YouTube and people can,

272
00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:18.820
will, will send folks to
your website, look at your

273
00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:22.000
book and your YouTube. But,
you know, I thought I

274
00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.240
was pretty good Excel. I
could write some, some formulas,

275
00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:28.570
but there's some really advanced
stuff. At least I thought

276
00:17:28.570 --> 00:17:31.810
it was advanced like V
lookup, like doing like master

277
00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:34.480
detailed reports and things where
you can have someone enter

278
00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:38.500
something in, look it up
in a totally different location,

279
00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:42.280
bring that data in. And
if you forget about the

280
00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:45.280
headers in the column, headers
in the row, headers, it

281
00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:47.470
sure looks like an application.
You know what I mean?

282
00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:49.740
Like it looks like anything
you could write. Have you

283
00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:52.920
ever given someone an Excel
spreadsheet thinking this'll be the

284
00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:55.080
prototype for the devs to
write and then have them

285
00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:58.080
say, we'll just use this.
Like, we don't even need

286
00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.250
to have them write the
app. We'll just use Oz

287
00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:05.420
is a Excel sheet. I've
had clients start that way.

288
00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:13.520
I haven't had directly, you
know, we start to build

289
00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:15.980
something and then they say,
Oh, nevermind what the devs.

290
00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:19.130
But I have had some
people say that, you know,

291
00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:22.160
we started with some developers
and we're just going to

292
00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:26.480
do this in Excel. Or
we started to do something.

293
00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:30.050
You know, I had some
people, they were going to

294
00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:36.320
try a Tableau and they
had the $999 a year

295
00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:40.370
per person. Okay. That wasn't
an issue we gave Tablo

296
00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:44.510
a week and our four
person team, we don't have

297
00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:47.120
time to go through the
learning curve and stuff. And

298
00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:51.590
Excel is good enough. So
Tableau is a, There's a

299
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:55.510
data visualization. Desktop is desktop
on a server and it's

300
00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:58.250
considerably more expensive if you
already own a copy of

301
00:18:58.250 --> 00:19:04.760
office, that's where they've gone
with Excel rather than going

302
00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:08.270
with a more complicated thing.
Yeah. And I agree with

303
00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:11.240
a statement I heard a
few years ago that Excel

304
00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:16.880
is the second best tool
for everything. Yeah. Somebody said

305
00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:19.010
that every, like, what is
someone say 80% of the

306
00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:21.200
world's business logic runs in
Excel. Like, I don't know,

307
00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:25.970
you know, behind every great
businesses, something running in an

308
00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:28.610
Excel. I mean, I know
that, yeah, I've done a

309
00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:30.730
lot of work in Excel
over the years. And I

310
00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:32.990
noticed that the title of
your, of your book that

311
00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:37.250
you did with, with bill
Jelen is gorilla data analysis.

312
00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:41.150
Like there's, there's an acknowledgement
in that word gorilla that

313
00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:44.870
maybe people won't necessarily respect
what you're doing, but you're

314
00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:46.700
saying, no, you get down
and get your hands dirty.

315
00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:50.390
You can do it. Yes,
it is because, and, and

316
00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:53.090
I liked it. See, he
asked me to update the

317
00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:55.550
book he had titled the
book. I grilled the data

318
00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:59.540
analysis back when he wrote
the original in 2002, when

319
00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:06.260
he asked me to update
it a year ago, how's

320
00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:11.810
it gorilla? Yes. Because Excel
users, we are that gorilla

321
00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:14.960
army we're ones who have
to go out in the

322
00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:19.970
street with our bats and
Molotov cocktails and raggedy plans

323
00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:22.820
and half hearted people. And
we have to go out

324
00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:26.660
there and win. You know,
we aren't the professionals who

325
00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:30.560
know all of the codes
and stuff, but we have

326
00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:34.100
to go up against them
and win. And I stay

327
00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:37.370
focused on the people who
have to live with the

328
00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:42.740
consequences. You know, the, the
chef that goes to the

329
00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:47.110
store and doesn't have the
right shopping list. Right. I've

330
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:50.230
dealt with that. You know,
I'm a chef that wanted

331
00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:58.030
to take a list of
the week's needs, you know?

332
00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:01.990
And I built an app
for her in Excel. You

333
00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:07.230
know, I think that as
we are out there trying

334
00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:09.930
to teach people to code
and teach kids how to

335
00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:14.820
code that, we might be
not focused enough on data

336
00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:18.900
literacy. Making me say it,
man, how are you sad?

337
00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:22.140
They're crying Babies that don't
understand how to manipulate data.

338
00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:25.800
Yeah. Yes, yes. Because I
get the apps and everything,

339
00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:33.390
but yes. Data literacy. Yes.
You know, cause something like

340
00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:37.740
pivot tables, pivot tables are
easy in Excel. Right? Pivot

341
00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:39.450
tables should be an interview
question. You want to see

342
00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:42.330
somebody who says, I know
X Excel on their resume

343
00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:44.310
and make them cry and
say, all right, bang out

344
00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:47.430
a pivot table. Yeah. But
now see, the thing, what

345
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:51.660
I've learned is a lot
of people's data is not

346
00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:56.400
ready to go into the
pivot table. They've got to

347
00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:00.060
do something to it, to
get it there. Now, how

348
00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:02.640
do we get people thinking
about what is going to

349
00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:07.680
take yes. Data literacy. That,
that is that's the term

350
00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:12.630
that's beyond. Anything I have
to say about Excel is

351
00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:16.500
more data literacy. Okay. So
you started doing your analysis.

352
00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:22.020
Have you checked the data,
quality, you know, all of

353
00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:25.560
this coding and stuff, you
know, it's frustrating. But I

354
00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:27.810
did talk with the founder
of one of the coding

355
00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:33.750
schools here in Portland and
her position was look at

356
00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:38.820
the need, look at the
market. People who code can

357
00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:43.380
go get jobs period. Okay.
So then, you know, anything

358
00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:46.350
I might've said about yeah.
But Excel. Well, that, wasn't

359
00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:49.260
how she was thinking, because
what she did was she

360
00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:51.600
went on a website and
she pulled something up and

361
00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:55.200
showed here is the need
for Excel developers. Here's the

362
00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:58.830
need for Jason developers. Look
at the graph. Okay. I

363
00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:03.060
get that. I have no
argument in that, you know,

364
00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:08.490
because she's not in a
job of, you're dealing with

365
00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:12.300
grant writers who have to
deal with data, she's trying

366
00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:16.680
to get people jobs. Do
you think that we should

367
00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:19.680
be teaching like office more
advanced? Like I know there

368
00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:22.500
are classes where we teach
office in Clinton school. Right.

369
00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:24.840
But you know, on the
word on the Microsoft word

370
00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:27.450
side, one of my most
popular YouTube videos was showing

371
00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:29.940
people how to use styles.
You know? And I feel

372
00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:32.160
like there's this, there's this,
like, I know how to

373
00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:35.310
use word. I open it.
I type and I hit

374
00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:37.890
save. And people think that
they think the same thing

375
00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:41.160
about Excel. But back in
my day, they were 40

376
00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:43.590
hour, a week long classes,
people teaching people how to

377
00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:47.120
use Excel and we only
scratch the surface. And now

378
00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:48.980
we don't seem to respect
that anymore. No one seems

379
00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:52.690
to think that's a problem.
And I think that it

380
00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:56.200
would be helpful in some
of these coding schools to

381
00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:59.410
show people Excel. Cause I'm
sure that they're dealing with

382
00:23:59.410 --> 00:24:03.310
data. If only, you know,
clients are giving them stuff

383
00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:08.560
in Excel and they don't
have to then manipulate it

384
00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:12.370
in R and Python and
stuff that they can use,

385
00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:17.710
what Excel has in it.
You know, It's definitely would

386
00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:21.760
be a recognition also that
the, the world, the computer

387
00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:25.270
world of technology where there's
not very pretty. And when

388
00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:28.090
you get into an enterprise,
there's some messy stuff going

389
00:24:28.090 --> 00:24:31.060
on in there. Yes. There
is. Data is not pretty

390
00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:34.450
businesses run on Excel. Businesses,
run on databases with bad

391
00:24:34.450 --> 00:24:38.410
data in and there's money
and correct me if I'm

392
00:24:38.410 --> 00:24:41.140
wrong here, but there's money
to be made, solving those

393
00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:44.530
real problems for real. Yup.
Yup. And lots of ad

394
00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:48.520
hoc, lots of things going
on with no process or

395
00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:52.930
no formal process. So this
all gets into the data

396
00:24:52.930 --> 00:24:58.390
literacy and beyond Excel, beyond
all of this coding. Yeah.

397
00:24:59.650 --> 00:25:05.620
Collecting, manipulating, interpreting, auditing data
and understanding that life has

398
00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:09.940
lists. Sometimes well-structured sometimes not
well structured and how to

399
00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:12.550
deal with that. I'm sure
that the Unix people would

400
00:25:12.550 --> 00:25:14.920
agree too, because you know,
when they're not using Excel,

401
00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:17.890
they use, you know, arc
and set and regular expressions

402
00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:20.830
and they move data through
these pipelines. The only difference

403
00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:25.120
is you're building your pipelines
in Excel. Yup. Yup. Yup.

404
00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:28.030
Where do people start? Do
they go to YouTube? Do

405
00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:30.070
they take a class? I
mean, you know, it seems

406
00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:33.130
like poking around in Excel
only gets you so far.

407
00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:39.610
Right there is I'm asking,
is it possible? And Excel

408
00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:45.190
are, is there a better
way than my paste and

409
00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:47.860
something in the, you know,
pasting the same information in

410
00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:51.430
four different places. Yeah. Is
there a better way I'm

411
00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:58.180
asking, is there a tool
in Excel that can, you

412
00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:02.980
know, do a lift anti
join for me, you know,

413
00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:09.610
are doing inner join. And
in 15 years when somebody

414
00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:13.150
is asked, if can Excel
do this, the answer has

415
00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:16.510
always been yes. Now they
might not like the price

416
00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:19.840
tag of it, you know,
for some things, but it

417
00:26:19.930 --> 00:26:24.490
has been possible. So I
say that is a matter

418
00:26:24.490 --> 00:26:31.180
of asking because canned courses
get it right. They scratch

419
00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:36.460
the surface. They give you
an overview. And I suggest

420
00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:40.930
people start with, what is
your need? What is your

421
00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:44.370
relationship to data? Because if
you don't build a lot

422
00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:46.530
of graphs, if you do
do a lot of data

423
00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:48.990
cleansing, then you don't need
to sit through a day

424
00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:51.270
and a half of how
to make charts in Excel

425
00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:58.770
in a canned course, you
know? So, you know, ask,

426
00:26:58.770 --> 00:27:02.550
is there a better way?
Are, is it possible talk

427
00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:05.220
to people who know Excel,
find out what that language

428
00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:08.340
is because yeah. You know,
there are things like cascading

429
00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:12.570
drop down list. What is
that? You know, but you

430
00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:19.500
might go into Google and
say, I'm in Excel, Dropbox,

431
00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:26.000
reliant on a previous Dropbox
and then Find the things,

432
00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:28.880
be a Google knowing the
right question to ask definitely

433
00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:31.910
are a big, a big
part of that. When do

434
00:27:31.910 --> 00:27:35.960
you think though, that people
are using Excel? Like you

435
00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:38.720
can say, it's easy to
say. Yeah. I think you

436
00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:40.910
can do it all in
Excel, but at some point

437
00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:43.550
it's not a database. It's
not a million. I'm not

438
00:27:43.550 --> 00:27:46.100
going to store my banking
records in it. You know,

439
00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:48.800
when, when is there too
much Excel? When is it

440
00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:51.440
a outbound outgrown? And now
it's time to do something

441
00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:54.890
else. So you're pausing. Like
you still, you like, ah,

442
00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:56.420
I still can't see a
scenario where I can't use

443
00:27:56.420 --> 00:27:58.760
it. You know what I
mean? It seems like Excel

444
00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:00.590
is your Swiss army knife
though. There must be a

445
00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:04.760
limit though. Yeah. There's a
limit. But then there's a

446
00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:08.570
limit to my uses for
it because I know people

447
00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:11.720
cause I was gonna think,
okay, you wouldn't run an

448
00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:18.890
international companies data on Excel,
but then I know people

449
00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:23.570
who do connect Excel to
databases and they would be

450
00:28:23.570 --> 00:28:27.590
better able to answer that
question. Yeah, sure. Well, I've

451
00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:32.480
seen people using power BI
and doing data visualization. So

452
00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:35.660
they're using power BI. They're
using Excel as a data

453
00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:39.470
visualizer and there, there, it
blurs the line between big

454
00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:42.470
data and Excel. So just
when you think you can't

455
00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:45.260
do it in Excel, somebody
goes and plugs it into

456
00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:48.470
a giant international database and
you're like, Oh, okay. Yeah.

457
00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:50.870
So it may not be
an XLS. Like we think

458
00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:53.660
of it, but still right.
So it's like, you know,

459
00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:58.310
looking off into the horizon
and saying, you know, I

460
00:28:58.310 --> 00:29:03.050
don't know what's after where
the world begins downward and

461
00:29:03.050 --> 00:29:05.870
I can't see over there,
you know, I haven't even

462
00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:08.150
told me. Yeah. So when
it gets to the point

463
00:29:08.150 --> 00:29:10.670
where you can't, you can't
do it in Excel, you'll

464
00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:13.610
you'll let me know. Yeah.
Yeah. I'll let you know,

465
00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:17.270
you know, there, there have
been tools that are better,

466
00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:22.880
you know, but then you
have just that thing, you

467
00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:29.330
know, cause ahead of problem
where somebody said, okay, we've

468
00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:34.370
got 30 students and we
would like a schedule that

469
00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:37.670
would match each of each
person up with another person

470
00:29:37.670 --> 00:29:42.970
because they're going to rotate.
Okay. So how can we

471
00:29:42.970 --> 00:29:46.390
do that in Excel? You
know, because then you got

472
00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:49.780
to think about, okay, it's
like Mary and John, but

473
00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:52.570
then you don't want to
also have John and Mary

474
00:29:52.570 --> 00:29:56.290
as an entry. And then
Mary, Mary and John, John.

475
00:29:56.290 --> 00:30:00.100
So you can easily pair
people up, but then you

476
00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:04.210
have to peel out those,
those duplicates. And then those

477
00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:10.270
same pairs, you know, I
found a round Robin calculator

478
00:30:10.330 --> 00:30:14.980
online. Okay. Use the round
Robin calculator because that's you

479
00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:18.400
got a round Robin tournament
is what that is just

480
00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:23.170
got 30 teams. Right, right.
So that was better for

481
00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:27.280
that. But that was just
a round Robin tournament. You

482
00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:32.950
know, calculator is not also
will financial managers at modeling

483
00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:36.750
tool. Sure. But even that,
I mean, I, I just

484
00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:39.780
actually talked to my finance
guy recently and he, he

485
00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:42.150
does a lot of his
work in Excel. The only

486
00:30:42.150 --> 00:30:45.060
thing he's careful to do
is not save data into

487
00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:48.630
it. So there's like Excel
as analyzer and then Excel

488
00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:52.050
as data storage, location light.
So he doesn't put my

489
00:30:52.050 --> 00:30:56.190
private financial information in it,
but he does transiently to

490
00:30:56.190 --> 00:30:58.380
do an analysis. And then
he makes me some beautiful

491
00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:02.550
reports. Right. And, and, and,
and he's able to modify

492
00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:04.530
the data. Like it really
is about putting the user

493
00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:07.800
in control of their data.
Yeah. Yes. And that's been

494
00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:10.920
a concern and a complaint
I've heard a lot about

495
00:31:11.010 --> 00:31:14.370
is, you know, putting things
in a database or in

496
00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:18.990
the fancy CRM, it can
be disempowering and Agni can

497
00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:21.720
create all the problems and
then inspire people to go

498
00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:25.620
rogue and go back to
Excel. True. And I think

499
00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:29.250
that idea that, that disempowering,
the end user, whoever that

500
00:31:29.250 --> 00:31:32.370
end user is, is really
what we're talking about here.

501
00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:35.880
That is, that is the
problem. So people can check

502
00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:42.390
you out at data scopic,
They can read about your

503
00:31:42.390 --> 00:31:45.780
book. They can go to
you tutorials. You've got extensive

504
00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:49.830
blog going back many years,
as well as your YouTube

505
00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:53.340
channel, which is full of
all sorts of great videos.

506
00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:56.430
And Camtasia's teaching Excel. And
some of the stuff that

507
00:31:56.430 --> 00:31:59.850
we talked about today Have
bins focused more on my

508
00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:03.630
videos lately. That's been so
much more fun and rewarding

509
00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:10.740
than running a blog, you
know? Cause well, it's, I

510
00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:14.670
have been thinking about, you
know, the difference between proprietary

511
00:32:14.670 --> 00:32:19.470
versus open source and WordPress
is this open source world

512
00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:23.430
where you got regular folks
and things keep changing and

513
00:32:24.210 --> 00:32:28.350
Oh man, I'm so tired
of it. You know, keeping

514
00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:30.060
it up to date. I
don't, I don't like, you

515
00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:33.150
know, and waking up one
morning and my site has

516
00:32:33.150 --> 00:32:36.810
crashed because of some conflict
with a plugin that some

517
00:32:36.810 --> 00:32:40.820
regular person wrote. You know,
now I'm a hack WordPress

518
00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:44.720
developer, you know, I need
something proprietary. I like working

519
00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:48.530
with Camtasia. It doesn't have
all kinds of random stuff

520
00:32:48.530 --> 00:32:51.800
in it that regular people
built and then abandoned it

521
00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:54.290
because they say, you know,
I want to go in

522
00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:58.190
and build wooden boats in
my yard. I don't want

523
00:32:58.190 --> 00:33:01.160
to do programming anymore. Now
I've got this plugin is

524
00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:04.580
Christ in my site. No
Camtasia doesn't have that. When

525
00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:07.190
I started with an idea,
I keep going with it,

526
00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:10.730
you know, that's cool. I
appreciate you holding it down

527
00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:13.940
for the regular people out
there. And an important reminder

528
00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:16.340
for people to think about
data literacy and to think

529
00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:19.280
about, Hey, Excel is a
product that's in your toolkit.

530
00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:21.320
Maybe you should give it
a second. Look before you

531
00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:23.960
bang out the visual studio
or you decide to write

532
00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:26.840
it and something other, some
other language. Yeah. Very cool.

533
00:33:27.890 --> 00:33:29.990
Thanks so much for chatting
with me today. Thank you.

534
00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:33.620
Appreciate it. This has been
another episode of Hanselminutes and

535
00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:35.180
we'll see you again next
week.
