00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.340
This is Lawrence Ryan announcing show
number 546. In this episode,

10
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.720
Scott talks with Scott Anderson about
the state of virtual reality,

11
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:12.030
2016. Hi, this is Scott
Hanselman. This is another episode

12
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.940
of Hansel minutes today. I'm
talking with Scott Anderson. He's a

13
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.470
virtual reality engineer at game
developer phenomena. How's it going?

14
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.290
It's going all right now,
are you Scott? I am

15
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.150
very well, and I'm very
happy to be talking to

16
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.760
you because, you know, I
read the verge and I

17
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.480
read ARS Technica and everything
says that this is it.

18
00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.210
Virtual reality is really happening
and it feels like it's

19
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.480
been happening for a while,
but now they're telling me

20
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.970
it really, really, really is
happening is it's going to

21
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.000
pop any second now. Yeah,
I mean, I think so.

22
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.450
I wouldn't be moving into
the field if I didn't

23
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.500
feel that was the case.
So, you know, I think

24
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.210
now we're finally at a
point where virtual reality headsets

25
00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.120
are good enough and relatively
cheap enough that average consumers

26
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.790
can enjoy them. So I
think that's a, that's a

27
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.200
big thing. I think it's
also the point where high

28
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.580
end consumer level hardware can
drive these headsets. And there's

29
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.500
a lot of different factors
that went into that happening

30
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.240
in a couple of years,
I've used an Oculus rift.

31
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.120
I've used the decay or
the developer kit one and

32
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.750
two. I haven't yet seen
the final one, but, you

33
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.340
know, I saw it getting
better and better, but I

34
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.040
always had that feeling. And
this is again, speaking as

35
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.700
a layman that I'm holding
a phone or a screen

36
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.490
in front of my eyes
and it's really close and

37
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.810
I can see the dots.
Yeah, that's been a significantly.

38
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.120
So I can go into
a little bit. And you

39
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.400
mentioned about the, the current
VR platforms and some ones

40
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.680
that are very close on
the horizon in the future.

41
00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.470
Maybe you can give me
a survey kind of like

42
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.020
from the, cause I know
that Oculus is the one

43
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.180
that everyone thinks about, but
I know it's a much

44
00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.850
bigger world out there. Yeah.
So If you look at

45
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.610
some of the history of
the development of Oculus, specifically,

46
00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.560
not of, of VR in
general, Oculus got popularized with

47
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.860
the Kickstarter and the DK
one or a development kit,

48
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.380
one, as you mentioned, which
I, which I, I am

49
00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.240
a backer of. So I've
been interested in VR for

50
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.770
a long time, kind of
populize VR again, but at

51
00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.410
the same time and a
little bit before that actually

52
00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.480
both valve who is the
creator of steam and half-life

53
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.420
was doing research into virtual
reality and augmented reality devices

54
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:41.230
and shared a lot of
research and technology with in

55
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:48.640
virtual reality hardware and software
shortly after the development kit

56
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.290
to Oculus launch, they were
acquired by Facebook. And at

57
00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.410
that point, valve kind of
decided to partner with HTC

58
00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:02.670
to create their own virtual
reality headset called Vive. So

59
00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.130
the major competitors better outright
now in the PC space

60
00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:11.470
in VR, AR the Vive,
the HTC Vive and the

61
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:17.200
Oculus rift VR is also
very, very important in mobile

62
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.240
and mobile. Both Oculus is
involved in, in mobile with

63
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.320
Samsung gear VR, which is
a slightly higher end VR

64
00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.810
headset, but Google got interested
in VR or around the

65
00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.930
time of the release of
the development kit to as

66
00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:41.500
well and made a CAEP
VR system for Android and

67
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.760
iOS called Google cardboard, which
is literally a cardboard box

68
00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.220
with lenses taped, You know,
and when that came out,

69
00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.190
I legit thought that that
was a joke. Cause you

70
00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.010
know, you see funny fake
websites made all the time.

71
00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.380
And I totally was like,
Oh, this is perfect. It

72
00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.480
looks just like a Google
thing. It's real. And then

73
00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.160
someone's like, no, that's a
really a thing like it's

74
00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.930
cardboard and it actually is
pretty good. We got it.

75
00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.020
I mean, it's, it's, doesn't
compare to, you know, we're,

76
00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.830
we're talking about a price
point of really basically free,

77
00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.040
but, but I think if
you cost and parts are

78
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:19.280
like $10 or $15 for
Google cardboard versus It's basically

79
00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:27.330
a phone, right. And versus
a HTC Vive, which has,

80
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.810
you know, full, full room
tracking of your head and

81
00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:35.340
hand positioned custom controllers and
it costs 800 bucks and

82
00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:40.350
requires a, you know, 1500
to $2,000 PC. So it's

83
00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:43.020
a, there's a big spread
in terms of costs. And

84
00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.700
these devices right now, Google
is working on, it's not

85
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:51.000
released yet, even though there
is a preliminary SDK available

86
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.500
on their website for an
enhanced version of cardboard called

87
00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.640
daydream, which will be a
little closer to the Samsung

88
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.810
gear VR and, and other
higher end mobile devices in

89
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.560
terms of power. And it
has its own motion controller

90
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.220
and it's a little bit
more fully featured. So, So

91
00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:12.640
let me break this down
again, thinking about this Nively

92
00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:15.790
because that's kind of the
value that I add here.

93
00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.310
You take a, let's go
from like the low end

94
00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:22.210
and work our way up
with cardboard. They literally took

95
00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:24.850
a phone and came up
with a cool cheap way

96
00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:28.150
to hold the phone in
front of your face. And

97
00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:32.380
I presume that the phone
has some, you know, gyroscopes

98
00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:36.460
of some kind, but it
doesn't, it's only as good

99
00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.430
as the, as the little
$3 gyroscope inside the thing

100
00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:41.920
and the software. So I
don't suppose it really knows

101
00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:45.280
that I've stood up and
walked around, right? Yeah, it

102
00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.040
doesn't. So the lower end
devices on mobile, and this

103
00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:53.350
is, this is universal with
mobile devices. Do not do

104
00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:55.600
any positional tracking, which is
a kind of a key

105
00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.410
point. And positional tracking is,
is instead of just looking

106
00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:03.460
at where you're facing, like
where your, your head is

107
00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:05.920
rotated, what you're looking at,
it's also looking at your

108
00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:09.370
position relative to a point
in space, usually the center

109
00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:12.970
of the room or to
a camera of your head.

110
00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:15.940
So you can move your
neck. You can, you can

111
00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:17.890
walk around and get up
and walk around and it'll

112
00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:21.280
still compensate for that and
your view in the virtual

113
00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.640
world. Okay. So then that
means that the phone that's

114
00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.460
floating in front of my
face knows that the phone

115
00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:30.970
has been turned, but it,
it, you know how, like,

116
00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:32.260
if you think about it,
you hold the phone in

117
00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.030
front of you and you
turn it up down left,

118
00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:36.970
right. Versus holding the phone
in front of your face

119
00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:39.610
and turning the phone, the
phone, the phone is moving

120
00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:43.690
along an arc length, a
distance from your face. They

121
00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:45.580
can do a little bit
of fakery to figure that

122
00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:48.340
out, but there's a lot
of math going on there.

123
00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:52.660
Yeah. And it's still legitimately
doesn't really know that it's

124
00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:54.790
going along an arc length.
It just thinks it's been

125
00:07:54.790 --> 00:08:00.400
turned. Yes. Ah, so it's
really got it. Doesn't have

126
00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:03.040
near enough information to make
the decisions. It would need

127
00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:06.160
to, to give you a
proper VR experience. Yeah, it

128
00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.830
does not. And that's, that's
some of the issue of

129
00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:11.380
phone VR, as you mentioned
before, you could kind of

130
00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:14.890
see the pixels on some
of the earlier develop Oculus

131
00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:22.990
development kits. That is a
artifacts called screen door effect

132
00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:25.990
or SDE. And it just,
it has to do with

133
00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:31.630
both the pattern of the,
the pixels on the LCD

134
00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:38.650
or led screen and the,
the size of those pixels.

135
00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:42.820
So better resolution and better
quality screens help with that.

136
00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:45.100
And this is why some
of the higher end devices

137
00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:48.550
require such powerful graphics cards
because they run it very

138
00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:55.060
high resolution. They're effectively 10
ADP per eye. And realistically,

139
00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:58.290
if hardware was powerful enough,
we'd probably want to go

140
00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:01.380
to 4k per se in
VR, but that's probably years

141
00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:04.190
off. Right. Right. Well, because
you've got it when you

142
00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:06.260
hold the phone, like right
now, I'm literally just holding

143
00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.200
my iPhone six plus in
front of my face. I

144
00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.080
notice of course, right away
that it's blurry. So I'm

145
00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:15.440
gonna need lenses to make
it clear and close, but

146
00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:19.130
also it can't possibly fail
my field of view. So

147
00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:22.010
I'm looking through a window
if I, you know what

148
00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:26.480
I mean? It doesn't even
remotely fill my view. You're

149
00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:30.650
saying we would need really
4k each eye filling the

150
00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:33.140
complete field of view before
we would get close to

151
00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:36.260
trying to fool somebody that
they were in a real

152
00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.860
place. Yeah. Well, I'd say
that the current high end

153
00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:44.000
hardware, even though it's not
that high resolution has relatively

154
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.200
high FOV field of view.
So yeah. Field of view.

155
00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:54.740
So it's generally not a
problem. I think certain people

156
00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:56.930
would prefer it to be
higher. And there are some

157
00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:01.790
experimental and prototype headsets that
have up to a hundred

158
00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:04.760
to 210, or I think
maybe higher field of view,

159
00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:07.340
which gives you a much
more prayerful vision. So if

160
00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:11.780
you, if you imagine the
current devices, you basically are

161
00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:13.460
kind of, you have a
little bit of a tunnel

162
00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:17.360
vision, right? You don't get
that your peripheral vision is

163
00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:21.890
somewhat black, but you're setting
the center field of view

164
00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:25.430
that you normally are focusing
on is perfectly clear. So

165
00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:27.800
you still feel pretty embarrassed.
It's kind of like the

166
00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:30.620
feeling of looking through goggles.
I mean, and in some

167
00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:32.780
ways you are looking through
goggles, right. But is it

168
00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.780
scuba diving or had ski,
Glock pebbles on the right

169
00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:38.330
where a little bit of
your, your view is blocked,

170
00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:41.540
but it's still clear and
it feels immersive. Well, you

171
00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:43.910
know, that's really interesting. I,
as I'm sitting here, I'm

172
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:47.900
looking at our recording stuff
and I'm focused on right

173
00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:50.390
now, I'm looking at your
name. And I just realized

174
00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:52.400
that my other two monitors
to my left and right,

175
00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:54.920
are in the periphery. And
as I look at your

176
00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:58.580
name, I cannot read what's
on the side. So one

177
00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:01.100
could argue that the computer
doesn't need to work so

178
00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:03.920
hard to keep those clear
why, you know, like, so

179
00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:06.830
if you were going to
do 4k, it would be

180
00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:10.790
silly and a waste of
CPU and GPU to not,

181
00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:13.550
it would be silly to
Rico to put full fidelity

182
00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:15.770
and full effort into stuff
that I'm really looking at

183
00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:18.860
in my periphery. So I
bet you with clever software

184
00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:21.650
tricks, you could focus on
the field of view that

185
00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:24.080
the person cares about and
then kind of blur out

186
00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:26.750
and have a gradient of
effort as you get out

187
00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:29.120
to the edges. Yeah. And
a lot of the work

188
00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:31.370
in terms of, and this
is actually a good segue

189
00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:34.070
to, to VR development in
some of the tools that

190
00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:38.090
we use in VR development,
but there's currently a lot

191
00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:43.160
of active research and constant
updates in both game engines,

192
00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:47.360
which tend to be the
way that people offer VR

193
00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:52.880
content, just because game engines
are the most evolved way.

194
00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:57.300
Building interactive, realtime, 3d content,
which is To go and

195
00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:59.010
build one out of the
box. We're gonna make a

196
00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:02.100
game, let's make an engine.
Yeah. Which for which for

197
00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:04.290
interactive VR experiences is kind
of the way to go

198
00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:06.900
film film is film works
a little bit differently and

199
00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:11.340
it requires custom camera rigs
and some editing software, but

200
00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:15.060
it doesn't necessarily require a
full game engine. But in

201
00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:18.810
the case of any kind
of interactive VR application, they're

202
00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:22.170
generally made in one of
two game engines, which is

203
00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:28.800
unity, 3d and unreal engine.
But as far as rendering

204
00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:34.260
optimizations go, the graphics drivers
vendors and the game engine

205
00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:39.540
vendors are working together to
do things like multi resolution

206
00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:44.010
rendering. So in the peripherals
render them at low resolution

207
00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:48.900
versus the center. And some
of the VR SDKs have

208
00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:54.540
tricks to draw or cut
out pixels. They can either

209
00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:58.620
cropped out in the process
of being displayed on the

210
00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:08.520
H and D the head
mounted display or distorted. Because

211
00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:12.600
if you, you, you can,
you can imagine like a

212
00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:17.700
monitors, a flat rectangle, right.
Generally speaking, or a window,

213
00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:20.010
I'm looking at a totally
flat 30 inch monitor right

214
00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:24.960
now With VR displays. The
lenses actually distort that and

215
00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:30.000
give it a pin cushion
effect. So the, the, either

216
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.520
the game engine or the
graphics drivers need to invert

217
00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:39.960
that distortion, the court cushion
lens distortion. And basically they

218
00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:49.320
kind of like a like
round image, basically. Interesting. So

219
00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.570
those are the kinds of
things where as a game

220
00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:53.970
developer, you would hope that
you picked a good game.

221
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.490
I go to engine that
did that for you. Like

222
00:13:56.490 --> 00:14:00.210
you're making games now at
phenomenon, you would not want

223
00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:01.860
to miss you. You would
want to educate yourself about

224
00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:03.540
this, but hopefully you're not
going to have to do

225
00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:06.030
that because you'll go to
your game engine and say,

226
00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:08.700
this would be a great
feature. You should put this

227
00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:11.100
at the stack. Not, I
shouldn't be thinking about that

228
00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:13.770
as an app developer. Yeah,
definitely. I mean, and I

229
00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:15.900
think that's the advantage of,
of, and the, and the

230
00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:19.450
reason why, you know, there's,
there's some statistic I heard

231
00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:22.860
where, you know, 95% of
games are made with unity

232
00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:26.730
three D. And if I
definitely recommend, if people are

233
00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:32.010
looking to get into VR
development, they download unity 3d

234
00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:35.970
it's, it's free, not free
as an open source free,

235
00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:41.280
but a free as in,
you know, beer free and

236
00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:47.820
download one of the VR
SDKs. There's, there's generally some

237
00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:53.480
built in support and unity
for virtual reality. So you,

238
00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:57.820
you can Actually just check
a checkbox and settings and

239
00:14:57.850 --> 00:15:03.520
it'll render to your virtual
reality head mounted display, and

240
00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:08.380
do the head tracking For
you. So you're saying I

241
00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:11.080
can get hello world VR
running in an hour. Yeah,

242
00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:16.720
definitely. But, Or less than
an hour, really. Like, I

243
00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:19.570
mean, it'd probably take an
hour to download unity and

244
00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:22.270
get a little bit familiar
with it. But if you,

245
00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:24.430
if you're already familiar with
and having it installed, it's

246
00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:27.280
really, you know, start a
blank project and you're in

247
00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:31.330
VR almost. Okay. So let's,
let's put a pin there

248
00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:33.550
for a second. And then
now that I know I

249
00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:35.920
can get hello world running
in and in, in unity

250
00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:39.850
or in an SDK quickly,
I can go from cardboard,

251
00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:43.480
which is a phone and
some cardboard, what would you

252
00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:45.970
put up the next step
gear VR, which is a

253
00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:50.260
phone in a smart VR
headset with additional, additional what

254
00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:55.180
So carb or so gear
VR has it's it has

255
00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:57.850
a much nicer case. It
has straps, which, which help

256
00:15:57.850 --> 00:16:01.780
it has better optics, which
has lenses. Built-in, there's also

257
00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:06.550
some extra hardware. And, and
you mentioned earlier about the

258
00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:10.180
gyroscope and the sensors in
the phone, not necessarily being

259
00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:15.190
high quality, depending on the
phone, et cetera. Right. They

260
00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:18.190
are actually has its own
custom set of sensors. And

261
00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:22.090
it designed specifically for VR.
So you get better tracking

262
00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:26.650
in the, in the harness.
Yes. And I think it

263
00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:28.600
has a little bit of
other hardware, but that's, that's

264
00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:32.440
mostly it there's. So you
are using the power of

265
00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:36.250
the graphics part of your
phone using a Samsung. And

266
00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:41.380
there there's interesting things with
it because there's actually the

267
00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:46.600
Samsung gear VR software puts
your phone in a special

268
00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:53.020
mode that tweaks the GPU
and the CPU and weird

269
00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:56.440
ways where it uses a
little bit more battery power,

270
00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:58.480
but it kind of drives
a little bit more powerful

271
00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:00.850
phone. Cause if you can
imagine a mobile phone, and

272
00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:02.530
this is usually what you
want to do in most

273
00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:05.980
cases, right? You want it
to be very power efficient

274
00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:08.500
and not ease a lot
of battery. Even if you're

275
00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:12.490
doing something like playing a
game or, you know, using

276
00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:14.620
a social networking app that
might use a lot of

277
00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:18.550
battery, right. And, or watching
the video, et cetera, in

278
00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:22.180
the case of VR, because
you kind of want that

279
00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:25.090
short experience, but you want
to get the best experience

280
00:17:25.090 --> 00:17:27.730
possible and you want it
to be as, Yeah. Kinda

281
00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:30.220
if I'm jacked into the
matrix, get that thing heated

282
00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:33.580
up. And let's, overclock Go
a little bit further. So

283
00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:36.940
that's another advantage of gear
VR and gear VR is,

284
00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:41.800
is only on high-end Samsung
phones. So I think it

285
00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:46.450
started with the <inaudible> and
they've done a couple of

286
00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:50.340
revisions for, for different high
end high end Samsung phones.

287
00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:54.890
And it's clearly Android based
only in that case. But

288
00:17:54.890 --> 00:17:57.200
is it true that the
work is still happening on

289
00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:59.330
the phone? The phone is
self contained, right? I'm not

290
00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:02.810
plugging my computer over the
phone, The phone, the app

291
00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:05.870
runs on the phone. Okay.
So then we've got, so

292
00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:10.520
then cardboard and gear VR,
AR mobile VR going kind

293
00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:13.610
of up the scale. Then
you move into Oculus and

294
00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:18.020
Vive. You are tethered or
somehow have a, an umbilical

295
00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:20.600
cord into a giant computer
with a great video card.

296
00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:24.830
Yeah. Yeah. Currently that's how
it works. There's actually a

297
00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:31.970
very active research into wireless
high end PC head mounted

298
00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:35.690
displays. None of that stuff
is available yet, but I

299
00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:37.520
don't know, it could be
in a year or a

300
00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:39.320
year and a half, you
know, I, I'm not sure

301
00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:41.030
what the timeline is, but
it seems like it's an

302
00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:45.200
active area. I mean, nobody
wants to have a giant

303
00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:48.090
backpack with a Falcon PC
on it, you know, And,

304
00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:50.540
and th th th the,
the tether and the cord,

305
00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:53.720
isn't a deal breaker by
any means, but he can

306
00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:55.790
be annoying. Right. It's, it's,
it's a nice to have

307
00:18:55.790 --> 00:18:57.620
the freedom. And that's actually
one of the things that

308
00:18:57.620 --> 00:19:02.960
mobile VR does better than
the high end stuff. So

309
00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:07.100
resist me. Like I have
a, what was amazing machine

310
00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:09.740
five years ago, but it's
still only what is this?

311
00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:12.680
I'm looking at my device
manager. I've got an Nvidia

312
00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:16.280
seven 50 when I go
online and I play lots

313
00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:18.470
of games at 10 ADP,
but I go online and

314
00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:20.750
they tell me that this
isn't even close for VR.

315
00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:26.270
Yeah. It's not See, even
pause to break it to

316
00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:28.210
me. You were like, I
don't want to. Yeah, it

317
00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:31.550
sucks. This was the greatest
video card in history when

318
00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:37.190
I bought it six years
ago. It's so, so about

319
00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:41.060
three years ago, I bought
a seven ADTI, which is

320
00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:43.940
the most powerful, which was
the most powerful graphics card

321
00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:49.040
at the time. Right. Exactly.
The VR specs when the

322
00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:53.510
Vive came out. So, yeah,
I mean, so now it's,

323
00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:57.650
it's, it's definitely recommended that
you get, you know, a

324
00:19:57.740 --> 00:20:00.680
nine 80 or a 10
80, the minimum spec is

325
00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:04.820
really like a nine 70
GTX and video occurred, but

326
00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:09.080
yeah, but AMD has, has
released a card that is

327
00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:13.580
like around $200, which is
a little bit more reasonable.

328
00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:15.080
It's still not the cheapest
thing in the world, but

329
00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:18.800
it's better than a five
or $600 graphics card that

330
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:22.820
is powerful enough to run
VR. So you're kind of

331
00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:25.940
seeing the thing where, you
know, a graphics card, performance

332
00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:29.720
pieces quickly, the VR men
spec was set at a

333
00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:36.290
very high level because so
previously to my job at

334
00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:38.780
phenomena, I worked as a
graphics engineer on call of

335
00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:46.400
duty, actually. So big AAA
game console game. And then

336
00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:50.380
that job 60 frames per
second was a big deal.

337
00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:57.490
You know, everyone is buttery
smooth in VR, the as

338
00:20:57.490 --> 00:20:59.110
in the high end stuff
and the, in the mobile

339
00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:02.740
stuff, 60 frames per second
is a requirement. If you

340
00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:07.320
don't want to make people
sick. Oh, so it's not

341
00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:12.540
just about gamers insisting on
60 frames. <inaudible> if you,

342
00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:16.020
if you drop even slightly
below the target frame rate,

343
00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:21.870
you will make people physically
ill potentially. And for most

344
00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:27.210
likely, so in the high
two eyes, there's tricks to

345
00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:32.040
reduce the cost of that
for, for two eyes, but

346
00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:37.410
it's still two eyes. And
for the high end stuff,

347
00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:41.250
it needs to run at
90 frames per second. So,

348
00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:43.920
which is kind of unheard
of in, in video game

349
00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:49.950
frame rates. And, but, so,
so kind of, I think

350
00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:54.480
years ago, Google was talking
about their target for a

351
00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:58.230
high performing web request was
200 milliseconds right in time

352
00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:00.480
from, you know, when you
type in a query into

353
00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:02.460
Google and obviously Google is
doing a lot of work,

354
00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:06.780
and that's a pretty reasonable
timeframe, I think for what's

355
00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:11.550
happening when you do a
Google query, but for high

356
00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:15.000
end VR at 90 FPS,
that means you have 11

357
00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:20.580
milliseconds to do everything, to
do all of your game

358
00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:25.740
logic, physics, render the world,
et cetera. And you have

359
00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:28.170
to hit that number. Otherwise
people start to get sick.

360
00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:30.780
And the effect you get
is a sin called jutter,

361
00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:33.720
where it feels kind of
like, as you move your

362
00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:37.080
head, it's not moving at
the same rate as your

363
00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:40.830
physical head is moving. Like,
like your eyes kind of

364
00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:44.370
are trailing behind where your
head is. So it's not

365
00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:48.000
a pleasant affect at all.
Someone told me once that,

366
00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:51.810
that literally like 10 to
20 milliseconds is the difference

367
00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:55.370
between people going, wow, that's
amazing. And people getting immediately

368
00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:59.250
and violently ill, it is
definitely like the brain rejects

369
00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:01.950
it. Like your body says,
Oh, you're in the matrix.

370
00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:04.740
That's amazing versus, Oh my
God, what are you doing

371
00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:06.750
to my, you know, this
is not okay, whatever this

372
00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:09.610
input is, you're giving me,
this is so bad and

373
00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:12.360
it's milliseconds. It makes a
difference. And the part that

374
00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:14.160
makes me so sad though,
is that we talk about

375
00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:17.340
this seven 50 video card
that I paid so much

376
00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:19.770
money for it. It's 140
bucks on eBay right now.

377
00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:20.850
You know what I mean?
You can get a hundred

378
00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:23.640
bucks on Craigslist. Does that
mean five years from now?

379
00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:27.540
I can get 2016 top
of the line VR for

380
00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:29.400
hundreds of hundred, couple hundred
bucks, but now it's gonna

381
00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:31.200
cost me A couple of
grand, but I'm hoping that

382
00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:32.970
the, both of the price
of the headsets and the

383
00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:35.940
price of the hardware comes
down very quick soon. I

384
00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:39.900
mean, it's, it's interesting. Cause
later in the year and

385
00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:44.130
into early next year, so
we talked about mobile and

386
00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:50.300
PC a VR, but game
counsels, obviously games are big

387
00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:52.250
application in VR. They're not
going to be the only

388
00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:55.040
one. I think there's a
lot of room for interesting

389
00:23:55.220 --> 00:24:00.590
creative applications and training industrial
applications as well. But games

390
00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:04.340
are obviously a big application
and continue to be so

391
00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:11.690
game consoles will support VR.
So PlayStation four and PlayStation

392
00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:14.600
four pro, which is a
more powerful version of PlayStation.

393
00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:19.640
Four will support PlayStation VR,
which is Sony's own customized

394
00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:24.860
headset that they're selling. And
then Microsoft is also coming

395
00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:29.180
out with a new Xbox
sometime next year, that will

396
00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:34.340
projects that will support some
VR headset. They haven't quite

397
00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:37.150
announced which one, Right? Some
kind of thing. And everyone

398
00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:40.030
wants to be the winner,
right? Like Oculus rift and

399
00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:42.880
Vive. So we talked about
gear VR, Oculus rift, and

400
00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:46.570
Vive are different if I
understand correctly, because Vive knows

401
00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:48.970
where you are in the
room and insist that you

402
00:24:48.970 --> 00:24:52.090
install stuff up at the
top of your ceiling, so

403
00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:54.370
it can position you in
a room. Well, isn't it

404
00:24:54.370 --> 00:24:57.430
true? That rift is more
of a, a sitting thing.

405
00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:00.550
It is seated, but there,
because of the success of

406
00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:03.880
the Vive, they're moving away
from that. So my game

407
00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:07.840
Luna actually, which I've showed
it PAX, which is penny

408
00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:13.000
arcade expo this past weekend
is it's kind of a

409
00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:22.030
creative musical puzzle game and
it's designed for so, so

410
00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:25.090
Vive has five shifts with,
and this is one of

411
00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:27.520
the reasons why it's more
expensive. It's shipped with tracked

412
00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:30.310
controllers, which effectively gives you
hands in the virtual world.

413
00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:37.600
So before Vive, outside of
some special case hardware and

414
00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:40.270
like, like things that didn't
necessarily come with the system

415
00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:44.050
like lead motion and Razer
Hydra, you didn't get hands,

416
00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:46.930
which is a huge thing.
Because as soon as you

417
00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:49.210
get hands in the three
world, you can manipulate things.

418
00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:51.760
You can pick up objects,
it just puts you in

419
00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:53.740
the space more. And it
gives you a lot more

420
00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:58.390
opportunity in terms of both
applications and games. Like you

421
00:25:58.390 --> 00:26:03.070
can imagine having a gooey,
but not having a touchscreen

422
00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:06.520
or a mouse, right. Without
the controllers. It's funny that

423
00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:08.530
you say that because you
know, people, I'm a windows

424
00:26:08.530 --> 00:26:10.720
person and people always, I
always tease Mac people because

425
00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:13.870
like, I like my iPad.
So I always touch my

426
00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:17.020
Mac and it's like, Hey,
how do you all survive?

427
00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:20.200
Like, that's, you're missing a
fundamental sense. And then I

428
00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:22.690
was playing with an Oculus
rift. I was thinking I

429
00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:25.990
was playing like Eve or
some space game. And I

430
00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:29.140
immediately looked down and my
hands weren't there. I was

431
00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:32.080
like, well, there's, there's my
knees, but my hands are

432
00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:33.850
missing. And there's like, Oh,
well you have to move

433
00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:36.040
with your mouse. And I'm
like, eh, it just it's

434
00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:38.220
like, it reminds you that
you aren't really sure. Exactly.

435
00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:41.800
So track controllers many make
a huge difference. So Oculus

436
00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:45.510
is kind of they're we,
we, we were showing our

437
00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:49.260
game on Oculus rip with
their controllers called Oculus touch,

438
00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:54.240
which will be a separate
addition to the headset, which

439
00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:57.930
are coming out sometime later
this year. And, you know,

440
00:26:57.930 --> 00:27:00.900
once again, it adds a
whole new layer to the,

441
00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:04.590
to the whole system and
it adds extra cost to

442
00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:10.890
the whole system also, unfortunately,
but you know, it's, I

443
00:27:10.890 --> 00:27:13.950
think it's a big deal.
And if you're doing development

444
00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:17.460
in unity, for example, in
order to support the controllers,

445
00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:20.760
you have to download the
custom SDKs for the platform

446
00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:25.790
holders. So, Well, your game
Luna, and we'll have a

447
00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:29.750
link to the show notes
at phenomenon.com/luna. It's meant to

448
00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:31.640
be tactile. Like it's not
just, Hey, look, we made

449
00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:34.220
a VR game. It's supposed
to be, you know, you're

450
00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:37.250
supposed to explore and use
gestures. Are you going to

451
00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:40.100
target? Are you and other
developers going to target one?

452
00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:42.560
Like we're gonna be like
Luna, best on Nakia or

453
00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:44.690
Luna best on Vive. Or
do you have to go

454
00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:47.600
and write the code to
make it work as best

455
00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:50.810
it can on everyone's headset?
And it scales up or

456
00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:53.000
down based on what kind
of positional controllers you can

457
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.850
get. It really depends on
the type of game you're

458
00:27:55.850 --> 00:27:58.580
making because our game is
so tactile. We, at this

459
00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:03.770
point, we were really focusing
on systems with controllers, right?

460
00:28:03.770 --> 00:28:09.980
So we probably won't support
Oculus rift without a, without

461
00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:12.920
the touch controllers. But at
the same time, there are

462
00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:15.830
ways to support everything. If
you want to put the

463
00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:19.550
effort into it and you
lose something, but in mobile

464
00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:23.120
VR, for example, or with
Oculus rift, without the controllers,

465
00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:30.980
the focuses on like gays
based interactions, which means you

466
00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:35.030
look at something and what
you have, like a little

467
00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:38.120
cursor in this interview view
and whatever you're focused on

468
00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:40.490
in your cursor, you can
interact with either by hitting

469
00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:43.220
a controller button or in
the case of a gear

470
00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:46.070
VR, you have a cardboard,
you have a button on

471
00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:49.410
the side of the headset,
then you can tap or,

472
00:28:49.410 --> 00:28:52.040
or clicking a mouse. And
these are all what's funny

473
00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:54.050
about this is that you
start to realize that like

474
00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:58.070
making a virtual universe or
virtual world is really complicated,

475
00:28:58.070 --> 00:29:01.280
like, think about what you
just described. Like, I want

476
00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:03.890
to take an action on
something I look at right

477
00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:05.930
now. I just look at
stuff, but I'm going to

478
00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:10.370
have to move my head
rather than actually looking point

479
00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:13.370
a.at something and then take
an action. And everyone's going

480
00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:17.150
to solve that differently until
we actually solve gaze tracking

481
00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:21.530
and include that in one
of these headsets. Yeah. But

482
00:29:21.530 --> 00:29:24.230
then theoretically though, if you
start checking off the list

483
00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:27.890
of stuff that one needs,
you know, super high Rez,

484
00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:33.020
no, jutter, you know, room
tracking, body tracking, maybe the

485
00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:35.780
ability to walk on something
like, I want to put

486
00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:38.360
a, I want to put
on a wireless headset, take

487
00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:40.910
a fake plastic gun, and
I want to run around

488
00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:44.680
my garage without bumping into
the door and play call

489
00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:49.830
of duty. That's the dream.
Yeah, definitely. And I mean,

490
00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:52.590
so there, there's, there's a
couple of interesting avenues there.

491
00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:55.380
So one thing that hasn't
really happened yet, but is

492
00:29:55.380 --> 00:30:01.050
being actively developed is inside
out tracking. So you can

493
00:30:01.050 --> 00:30:06.060
imagine, yeah. You can imagine
that like when the case

494
00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:09.570
of the Oculus or the
Vive you have outside in

495
00:30:09.570 --> 00:30:13.560
tracking where effectively there's cameras
or lasers, you know, scanning

496
00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:15.810
your room or cameras, like
looking at you and doing

497
00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:18.000
some computer vision stuff to
figure out where you are,

498
00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:22.020
but inside out tracking would
be a camera on your

499
00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:26.040
device, looking at your room,
scanning the room, figuring out

500
00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:27.900
what the geometry of your
room is and how far

501
00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:31.200
you moved. This is a
much harder problem from a

502
00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:36.520
computer vision standpoint, I guess,
than can the, the, the

503
00:30:36.530 --> 00:30:41.240
inverse. But I think that
opens up the ability to

504
00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:43.320
move around a little bit
more in your space and

505
00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:48.180
do more interesting things there.
And there, there's also these

506
00:30:48.210 --> 00:30:52.830
ideas of location-based VR, where
you get a much like,

507
00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:56.550
like obviously, you know, one
of the issues with the

508
00:30:56.550 --> 00:31:00.930
vibe is that most people
don't have the room for

509
00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:03.390
the full tracking area in
the Vive. I definitely don't

510
00:31:04.170 --> 00:31:05.760
in my house. Right. I
have a, I have a

511
00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:09.870
small tracking area in an
office, but if you go

512
00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:12.090
to a location based thing,
they can rent out a

513
00:31:12.090 --> 00:31:16.050
whole warehouse or host stadium,
right. And track you. And

514
00:31:16.050 --> 00:31:18.960
you can run around pretty
freely in some of these

515
00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:24.630
experiences without like, you know,
fear of running into a

516
00:31:24.630 --> 00:31:27.870
wall or, you know, bumping
system, Which is why even

517
00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:30.420
now in 2016, we still
play laser tag. You know,

518
00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:32.850
when we go out cause
they have a warehouse. And

519
00:31:32.850 --> 00:31:36.720
so that means that it
could be maybe overstating things,

520
00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:38.610
but it could be the
return of the arcade in

521
00:31:38.610 --> 00:31:41.130
the sense of, I got
my thousand dollar VR at

522
00:31:41.130 --> 00:31:44.250
home and my $10,000 one
at the mall. Yeah, definitely.

523
00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:47.190
And there's kind of an
arise of these VR cafes

524
00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:50.430
because, because of the cost
of the headsets, and there's

525
00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:52.770
a lot of demand for
people to just want to

526
00:31:52.770 --> 00:31:58.080
try them out or like
occasionally play VR experiences. Cool.

527
00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:01.800
So people can learn about
Luna and phenomena and the

528
00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:09.060
games that you all make
there@funomena.com. And there's a bunch

529
00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:10.470
of games that you're working
on. The one you're working

530
00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:13.140
on now is, is Luna,
L U N a. We'll

531
00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:15.690
put a link to that
in the show notes and

532
00:32:15.810 --> 00:32:16.980
people can watch it. I
know that there was a

533
00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:22.560
teaser trailer released recently. Yeah.
And there's actually some gameplay

534
00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:29.880
from PACS that polygon put
out. And I, I recommend

535
00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:32.040
that people take a look
at that also As well.

536
00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:34.440
And what do you recommend,
do you think which VR

537
00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:38.640
headset should I be saving
up for right now? Right

538
00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:42.230
now think both the Oculus
rift and touch, even though

539
00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:47.720
it's not out yet the
vibe and PSVR, which is

540
00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:49.760
also not out yet, it
will all be good options

541
00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:54.680
for different reasons. I own
a Vive just because it

542
00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:57.290
was kind of the first
to do track controllers, but

543
00:32:57.290 --> 00:33:00.650
I also have a Oculus
rift at home as well.

544
00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:03.920
So, you know, I'm, I'm
like kind of just like

545
00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:07.850
have everything, but I think
if you were to buy

546
00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:09.530
something right now, like if
you're going to go to

547
00:33:09.530 --> 00:33:13.040
the store and buy a
headset, this minute, Vive is

548
00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:14.930
probably your best option. If
you're going to wait a

549
00:33:14.930 --> 00:33:20.180
little bit until next year,
definitely the Oculus rift or

550
00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:24.560
with the controllers or PlayStation
VR, if you are more

551
00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:26.990
of a console gamer and
want to play like in

552
00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:30.770
your living room would be
good options as well. It

553
00:33:30.770 --> 00:33:33.650
sounds like it is. I
would be jumping in and

554
00:33:33.650 --> 00:33:35.450
picking something. I have to
pick a horse in this

555
00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:37.880
race. So it sounds like
there isn't a simple answer,

556
00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:42.590
but if I pick something
big, a big company with

557
00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:44.360
a lot of support behind
it, I am definitely going

558
00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:45.530
to have fun. And I
think that if I can

559
00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:47.420
get something where I can
get the games on steam

560
00:33:47.930 --> 00:33:51.140
and then I'll probably be
okay. Yeah, definitely. And you

561
00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:53.090
can get, you can get
games for both Vive and

562
00:33:53.090 --> 00:33:56.780
Oculus rift on steam. So
there you go. Very cool.

563
00:33:56.810 --> 00:33:59.000
Well, thanks so much for
chatting with me today. Oh,

564
00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.670
it was great talking to
you. Very cool. That's Scott Anderson,

565
00:34:01.670 --> 00:34:05.930
virtual reality engineer at phenomenol
working on Luna. This has

566
00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:09.140
been another episode of Hanselminutes
and we'll see you again

567
00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:09.680
next week.
