00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:51.140
<inaudible> From Hanselman it's dot
com. It's Hansel minutes. Oh,

9
00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.700
weekly discussion with web developer
and technologist Scott Hanselman. This

10
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.810
is Lawrence Ryan announcing show number
four 19. In this episode

11
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:05.720
of Hansel minutiae, Scott talks
with Richard Campbell. Hi, this is

12
00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.810
Scott Hanselman. This is another
episode of Hansel minutes, and

13
00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.740
I'm talking with Richard Campbell, which
makes this Hansel minutiae 14,

14
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.270
13, 14. We lost count
at some point, I think

15
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:23.570
we may have recorded 11
twice. We've done a bunch

16
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.360
of these and I get
people ask me regularly when

17
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.910
we're going to do the
next one. That's interesting. So

18
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.700
your claim to fame is
no longer a, you know,

19
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.250
a decade on dotnet rocks
and thousands of shows and

20
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.980
tablets show it's. I've been
able to talk to you

21
00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.870
a dozen times, and that's
the only thing that matters

22
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.110
to anyone. Exactly. That is
you're the occasional guest spot

23
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.590
on this show for not
being a guest. What would

24
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.560
I be? Thank you so
much for saving my career.

25
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.240
I really appreciate it. Oh
yeah, I know. And you

26
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.700
were, you were destitute before.
How jet lagged are you?

27
00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.790
You know, it's funny. I'm
really not jet lagged and

28
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.680
my wife will not believe
me. I am not yet.

29
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.490
Like I got back from
New Zealand yesterday. Oh man. And,

30
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.370
but I try to explain,
as I've explained to everyone

31
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.640
who has insisted, it's always
wonderful when you're fully fine

32
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.560
and people are like, no,
you're jet lag. You're messed

33
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.450
up. No, no, I'm really
inside my own head. I'm

34
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.570
here. Just did an inventory
and I'm fine. New Zealand is,

35
00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:26.210
is 20 hours ahead. Right.
But it's, that's great. Cause

36
00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.670
it flips over the international
Dateline. So what I do

37
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.060
is I ignore the Dateline
part. I don't look, I

38
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.160
take my watch that I
have, that has no date.

39
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.040
I ignore the day completely.
And I just decide that

40
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.060
it's four hours behind. Right.
Which makes it like going

41
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.120
to Hawaii. So I have
no jet lag at all.

42
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.630
I am fresh and Footloose,
fancy, free feeling. Good. How

43
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.810
was the show? A code
mania is a really lovely

44
00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.500
conference. So if anyone is
ever in or around Auckland,

45
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.300
New Zealand, I would encourage them
to check it out. It

46
00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.310
was large. It was well-organized.
Everyone was, they had Leah

47
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.160
Varu from the W3C was
there and she did an

48
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.090
amazing job. Troy, He's a
great speaker. I'm always blown

49
00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.200
away by her. She has
a amazing talk called mr.

50
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.120
Border radius. And the entire
talk is about this little

51
00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.720
character. Who's like a little
cartoon man made entirely with

52
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.960
a, you know, border radiuses.
And it sounds like, how

53
00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.300
could you do a talk
like that? But we had

54
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.020
her at angle brackets and
she did an hour on,

55
00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.940
on just that one tag
and the power of this

56
00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.000
one CSS tag. And I
wanted to watch another hour

57
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.450
after that. Wow. That's awesome.
It was amazing. So definitely

58
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.960
awesome. And we also saw
Troy hunt. He's the guy

59
00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.050
who wrote the, a website
called world's greatest Azure demo.

60
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.360
Basically it's a one hour
demo of everything you can

61
00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.400
do in Azure. So he's
doing my job for me.

62
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.880
He knows web security really
well too. We've had him

63
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.630
on dotnet rocks. Yeah. Yeah.
Definitely two people who know

64
00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.110
their stuff backwards and forwards.
So it was cool. And

65
00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.600
then I was at build
also for like a day

66
00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.850
Day. You just tore in
and tore out. I was

67
00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.190
there for the duration. Yeah.
I wanted to be there.

68
00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.840
But the problem, the issue
was that I had been

69
00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.460
invited to code mania a
year ago and before build

70
00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.490
had been scheduled. And I
really, you know, I, I

71
00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.710
don't want to cancel if
I tell someone I'm going

72
00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:18.300
to be where I'm going
to be. Yeah. I know

73
00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.700
that's a character thing right
there. And how far in

74
00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.340
advance did you know about
bill? Because the outside world,

75
00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.220
I mean, there's almost no
notice it just a, I

76
00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.310
think I ended up learning
about it in like February

77
00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.030
or early March. I mean,
it was pretty early. It's

78
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.180
that start early. That's really
late, you know, to book

79
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.310
Moscone, that's the sort of
thing you do a year

80
00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.040
in advance. Well, yeah, I'm
sure that I'm sure that

81
00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.470
someone knew, but I didn't
figure it out. I didn't

82
00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.960
figure out that I had
double booked a conference until

83
00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.290
January at the, at the
earliest, but I have to

84
00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.420
go and check my emails,
but I, you know, I

85
00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.060
guess the, you know, the,
Oh crap moment happened in

86
00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.640
January somewhere, but the folks
at code mania were very

87
00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:01.290
accommodating and they moved my
workshop. So I was able

88
00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:05.760
to participate and me and
Scott Hunter did our, our talk

89
00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.150
and it went okay. Yeah.
The lesser known Scott, who's

90
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.010
someone, I think the world
of a nearest, I can

91
00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.690
tell anybody who actually works
with them find it's it

92
00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.750
feels the same way to
mr. Amis Bridgewater is a

93
00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.690
good man. Hunter is one
of the, one of the

94
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.760
lesser Scots. You haven't heard
that. That's like, they call

95
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.050
us that now. Well, cause
the big Scott's really big

96
00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.710
these days, executive VP. Holy.
Yeah. He has like a

97
00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.260
Prius waiting for him outside
of meetings so that he

98
00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.870
can get to the next
meeting in time. Nice. Yeah.

99
00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.010
They call it a triple
eight. It's a executive VPs

100
00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:42.900
at that level. Literally have,
they don't have to wait

101
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.990
for a shuttle. They have
their, their, their people manage

102
00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.780
their time. So they have
like a little electric car

103
00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.700
that's sitting out front waiting
for them to drive from

104
00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.790
nice thing. That's the perk
you get. There you go.

105
00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:56.580
Yeah. It's pretty cool For
Ray, for being responsible for

106
00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.740
almost development does at Microsoft.
Yeah. You do. You get

107
00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.080
a bodyguard and I don't
know someone to hold your

108
00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:07.420
laptop, but no, you get
a Prius. It's cool though.

109
00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.920
A lot of stuff came
out of build. Yeah. Like

110
00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:16.720
a great news. I, I
liked the keynotes and I

111
00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.630
think it created a great
tone. It's like the first

112
00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:23.470
time we see Sacha as
CEO is at build, I

113
00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:26.440
just was so thrilled about
that. I could, could have

114
00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.140
done without quite as long
a laundry list, even though

115
00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:32.410
the laundry list was all
good news. It was long.

116
00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:36.610
Yeah. He, He is kind
of a poise about him

117
00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:39.100
that I, I must say
I like a lot. Yeah.

118
00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:42.520
He's energetic without being over
the top and he's really

119
00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:46.060
engaging. Like it felt good
listening to them. Yup. Yup.

120
00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:47.860
I think that if there
was any question that he

121
00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.170
was the, you know, was
he the right person for

122
00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:53.920
the job? I think that
that got pretty much confirmed

123
00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.650
that he's, he's a, he's
a good egg at, at

124
00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:00.630
this conference. He's he's just
very poised. Yeah. Yeah. So

125
00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:03.490
I like him. I'd just
like to see, I hope

126
00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:07.060
next year he does a
more traditional keynote where just

127
00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.610
give us an inspirational view
of where the company is

128
00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:12.340
going and then let us
get to the side. Yeah,

129
00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:16.060
yeah, exactly. Yeah. It, his,
his keynote made sense and

130
00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:18.010
it set the tone and
setting the tone is I

131
00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:20.930
think the primary job of
a CEO. Absolutely. Yeah, yeah.

132
00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:25.090
Yeah. And we're starting some
interesting announcements. There's lots and

133
00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:27.850
lots of open source stuff
going on. So that wind

134
00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:32.410
JS is open sourced and
running on running cross platform,

135
00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.060
which I think is confusing
to a lot of people.

136
00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:37.880
Yeah. Because when jazz is
supposed to be wind. Yeah.

137
00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:40.780
Well maybe, maybe it doesn't
mean windows. Maybe it means

138
00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:44.590
winning. I don't know. But
you know, the, what I,

139
00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:47.350
well I'm used me was
they did the wind JS

140
00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:49.210
announcement first and then the
next day they did the

141
00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:53.400
Roslyn announcement. Hmm. Yeah. So,
You know, when I, there

142
00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:54.760
was a, I was sitting
at a table with some

143
00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.620
folks just listening in and
the guy said, well, when

144
00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.510
I saw the wind jazz
announcement, I thought, Oh good.

145
00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:01.210
Microsoft's done with wind Jay.
Yeah. So they're opening sources.

146
00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:03.090
You have to get rid
of it. No, no. It's

147
00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:05.350
much, much bigger than that.
Yeah. And I know that's

148
00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:09.070
not accurate, you know, it's
not a true statement at

149
00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:11.080
all. It's not the way
Microsoft does stuff in the

150
00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:13.240
open source community. But then
when Roslyn, you said, then

151
00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:18.250
Roslyn gets open sourced and
C-sharp is not going away.

152
00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:21.580
So now I don't think
I understand open source. Yeah.

153
00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:25.000
So People at Microsoft and
this is just me speaking

154
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.660
for what I have seen.
Okay. Right. But we, we

155
00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:31.450
are very, Very careful to
not want to throw something

156
00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:35.260
over the fence. Right. So
open sourcing as a way

157
00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:39.910
of, of dumping something. They're
always talking about that. They're

158
00:08:39.910 --> 00:08:43.480
always saying we can't do
that. Like anytime someone's like,

159
00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:44.950
like I want to open,
I've been trying to open

160
00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:48.280
source a thing called log
parser. It's an IIS log

161
00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:50.410
parcels. Now I use it
all the time. So I've

162
00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:52.990
been trying to open source
that for like a year.

163
00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:55.680
Wow. And yeah, I mean,
cause it would be an

164
00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:59.610
obviously cool thing to open
source. The problem is every

165
00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:00.930
time I bring it up
and I brought it up

166
00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:04.410
last week, in fact they
S a number of folks

167
00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:07.200
said, well, but who is
going to maintain that? Like,

168
00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:10.770
who's going to shepherd that.
And, and I'm like, well,

169
00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:12.510
you know, it doesn't really
matter. And they're like, yeah,

170
00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:14.700
it didn't really matter. It
does. We don't want it

171
00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:18.030
to look like we're just
trying to dump this. So,

172
00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:20.250
so they, they won't open
source something unless they know

173
00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:24.030
that it's going to live,
you know, beyond, you know,

174
00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:25.920
a year or two after
it gets out there. So

175
00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.620
I got a licensing problem.
Right. Cause often I could

176
00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:32.370
see internal, there's a lots
of cool things that Microsoft

177
00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:35.070
built internally that they didn't
let other people download. But

178
00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:36.660
whenever you talk to them
about why is this open

179
00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:40.140
sources? Like, you know, legal,
we just can't get through

180
00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:42.360
to free the whole thing
up. No, it's not about

181
00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:44.580
that. It's not about that.
Yeah. Legal is fine. Like

182
00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:45.900
legal is totally like if
we can come up with

183
00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:48.630
a good, a good reason.
Right. And they're like, Oh

184
00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:52.920
yeah, cool. Rocket run, rock
on. But if, if you,

185
00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:55.410
there's two things that we
need, we need a sponsor

186
00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:59.940
internally. Right. And a sponsor
externally. Yeah. And I think

187
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:02.610
you need to, somebody needs
to commit to being the

188
00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:05.490
leader of that project as
an open source project thereafter.

189
00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:09.090
Yeah. Yeah, exactly. It's you're
having a child essentially. Yeah.

190
00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:12.150
We almost had someone who
was willing to take it.

191
00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:15.210
The other thing though, is
that people have these historical

192
00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:18.870
applications that they love, like
in this case log parser,

193
00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:21.180
but then they, you look
at the code and really

194
00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:22.620
no one should be proud
of it. You know? Like

195
00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:26.370
it's often something that was
cobbled together and then more

196
00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:28.350
people used it and cobbled
some more and cobbled some

197
00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:31.260
more that it's not a
thought through app. It was

198
00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.750
a needed thing. I got
lots of software. I built

199
00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:35.910
like that. Oh yeah. Well,
I mean, does blog, I

200
00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:38.130
mean, Clemens, I always joke
about that, but dodgeball is

201
00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:40.740
very much like that as
well. It's a great application.

202
00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:43.440
People keep asking me what
blogs system I use. I

203
00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:45.150
tell them and they're like,
Oh, good. I'll use that

204
00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:46.830
one. I'm like, Oh, you
really don't want to use

205
00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:50.670
that. You know? Like, like,
is it dead? I'm like,

206
00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:54.900
it's not dead. It's just
done. Yeah. It's finished. It

207
00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:57.120
works great. It's I will
continue to use it one

208
00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.130
day. I'll upgrade to WordPress
if I want my blog

209
00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:02.160
hacked on a regular basis.
Nice. And you know, but

210
00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:05.100
no, you don't want to
use DAS blog. It's fine.

211
00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:08.040
And it's rock solid, but
don't don't have any expectations.

212
00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:10.800
You know, it's like buying
a used car and here's

213
00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.380
what it is. It is,
you know, people should treat

214
00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:15.180
more open source. Like the
fact that it's a used

215
00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:16.980
car, you know what I
mean? Like, is this a

216
00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:19.050
new car or used car?
Am I going to get

217
00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:21.420
warranty support? Yeah, they should
be in it. You know,

218
00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:22.860
we should do that. There
should be like an implied

219
00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:25.740
warranty. And then at the
same, at the same time,

220
00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:28.110
when people put, when people
pick open source, I tweeted

221
00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:30.180
about this a couple of
months ago, how funny it

222
00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:33.720
was that I saw at
corporation decided not to use

223
00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:36.630
an open source project. And
when, when pressed on why

224
00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:39.330
they would not use it,
they said, well, the college

225
00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:42.690
student that maintains it is
not interested in working on

226
00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:46.640
anymore. Ha ha Ah, you
know what I mean? Okay.

227
00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:49.640
You know, I don't know
whatever bank America or whoever

228
00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:53.290
it was large American corporation,
American corporation, you don't to

229
00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:55.950
in turn Controls your company.
Right? Well, not even an

230
00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:59.280
intern, like some, some very,
very well meaning 12 year

231
00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:03.240
old Norwegian high school student
is apparently no longer interested

232
00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:07.620
in taking poll requests. Therefore
you will no longer be

233
00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:09.780
picking that. That doesn't make
any sense right now. It's

234
00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:12.450
like crazy. And the other
way to play, this is

235
00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:15.990
like what red gate did
with, with glimpse where they're

236
00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:17.580
like, Hey, why don't we
just take care of the

237
00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:20.640
guys who invented this project,
make sure that they are,

238
00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:22.560
they can continue to work
on it still as an

239
00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:25.500
open source project, no chain
of ownership at all, but

240
00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:27.660
they want to roll. You
know, why wouldn't the corporation

241
00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:30.600
do that? Hey, it doesn't
cost much to take care

242
00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:33.930
of that person to keep
that project going open source

243
00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:37.350
and being valuable for people.
And it's actually a move

244
00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:40.170
of Goodwill at the same
time. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. I

245
00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:43.020
think that that having a
corporate sponsor is a great

246
00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:46.830
idea. Yeah. So It's a
mature thing. You know, we're,

247
00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:51.300
we're inching towards actually being
a charity in humanitarian toolbox.

248
00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:54.510
Now I got more, I
got more IRS paperwork coming

249
00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:56.460
in. And one of the
parts of this is this

250
00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:59.850
idea that we could end
up with charitable contributions in

251
00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:02.970
the form of corporations taking
on specific applications that are

252
00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:06.600
used by disaster relief workers.
Oh wow. That's amazing. Yeah,

253
00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:09.690
It's getting there. It's it's,
it's a long line making

254
00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:11.640
a charities hard and it
was not what I planned

255
00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:13.830
on doing. You know, this
was just, I thought it

256
00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:17.010
would be fun to every,
you know, developers like building

257
00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:19.110
software that makes a difference.
And here was a little

258
00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:21.420
infrastructure we could build that
could make a difference for

259
00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:23.790
people, but then their right
way to do things turned

260
00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:26.250
out to actually filing an
awful lot of legal paperwork

261
00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:29.700
and spending hours and hours
with lawyers and the IRS

262
00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:32.550
to, to really take, take
it as far as it

263
00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:35.820
can go. My paperwork. It's
amazing how much paperwork there

264
00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:36.810
is. I think that if
we want to do to

265
00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:41.160
make it make small business
and, and charities work better,

266
00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:44.130
we would have less paperwork.
I'm trying to do a

267
00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:47.160
small startup right now with
a friend. And we have

268
00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:51.270
spent more time with the
LLC, the code signing certificate

269
00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:55.050
and the banks paperwork than
we have on the actual

270
00:13:55.980 --> 00:14:00.570
Right now. And I also
appreciate that people exploit the

271
00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:04.920
charitable model to do inappropriate
things. And clearly I got

272
00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:06.630
nothing bad to say about
the IRS guys. Like they,

273
00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:09.630
they are looking for the
right things, you know, are

274
00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:11.490
you actually trying to do
good here? Or are you

275
00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:14.310
trying to wash money here?
You know, like that's what

276
00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:16.860
they're looking for. It's pretty
clear what they're trying to

277
00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:21.510
do. Yeah. Can I also
wash my money here? Apparently?

278
00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:25.890
No, it's against the rules.
It's a bummer though. Yeah.

279
00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:29.340
I'm, I'm willing to, if
I can, if this actually

280
00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:30.600
is the thing I've got
to do to make a

281
00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:33.060
difference in the world, I'll
do it. It's not that

282
00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:36.000
bad. Did you? Another thing
that came out of build

283
00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:39.180
was the new update to
windows, which is the poorly

284
00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:43.350
named as if we had
expected anything less a windows

285
00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:48.280
8.1. Yeah. Did you, did
you get that? Yes. I

286
00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:53.630
installed the six knowledge-base files
in the correct order on

287
00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:56.360
my laptop. Well, to be
clear, that'll all just have,

288
00:14:56.380 --> 00:15:00.190
But automatically on windows, windows
updates. So one day you'll

289
00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:02.680
wake up and it'll just
be better. Yeah. But right

290
00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:05.110
now for us geeks, if
you want it today, which

291
00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:06.790
you can get, I mean,
it's not like it's a

292
00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:09.610
terribly hard hoop to hop
through. You just have to

293
00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:13.540
install one reboot, install it
XON reboot until you're done.

294
00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:15.610
He did the whole thing
and did not reboot once.

295
00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:17.890
I just, whenever it says
reboot, you just say later

296
00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:19.330
in it, I did the
whole thing all in one

297
00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:23.380
Fell swoop and then rebooted
once. Yep. And it works

298
00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:26.290
just fine. I did it
on five machines. So it's

299
00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:28.120
just the gist and it's
six files have to be

300
00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:31.030
done the right order Again,
this is with MSDN people

301
00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:35.470
only. Yeah. Yeah. But, and,
and I actually, interestingly, interesting

302
00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:39.070
insight of the six files.
I didn't have to do

303
00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:41.500
two of them. You already
had them, which means that

304
00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:45.220
they're starting to just, you
know, prep your machine, you

305
00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:47.170
know, by, by trickling out
the littles. Cause it's, you

306
00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:49.750
know, this little tiny fix
prepares the system for that

307
00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:51.820
little tiny fix. So I
think that it's kind of

308
00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:53.710
rolling out now and we'll,
we'll see it in the

309
00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:56.350
next couple of months. Great.
I had one already on

310
00:15:56.410 --> 00:15:59.320
my laptop, so yeah. Same,
same sort of thing. And,

311
00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:01.900
but it absolutely worked. It's
a nicer version of windows.

312
00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:04.240
No two ways about it.
Yeah. Let me give it

313
00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:05.950
a name. I didn't think
I was going to like

314
00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:09.130
it. Like I saw the
screenshots and I was like,

315
00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:12.970
what kind of weird hybrid,
you know, freaky thing is

316
00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:15.190
this going to be? And
like right now I'm on

317
00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:17.800
my, on my big monitor
here and I've got my

318
00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:21.790
desktop apps and my store
apps running that are running,

319
00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:24.580
sitting in the task bar.
Right. So this is actually

320
00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:28.120
got me using the mail
app more because I can

321
00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:29.500
see it now. You know
what I mean? Like I

322
00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:31.870
spend most of my time
on the desktop. Yeah. Me

323
00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:35.860
too. And so invariably I
live in outlook. Yeah. And

324
00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:37.570
I, and I spent a
lot of time making sure

325
00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:40.360
the mail app didn't annoy
me no more popups and

326
00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:43.480
stuff, but yeah. I can
see actually getting there. Yeah.

327
00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:46.270
For, for desktop users. I
think it's definitely an improvement.

328
00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:50.530
I don't know. It's kind
of weird though, that you

329
00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:54.460
see the apps that are
quote unquote running in the

330
00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:56.680
background. Cause they're not really,
you know what I mean?

331
00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:59.350
But it does. It gives
the impression that these apps

332
00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:03.040
need to be shut down.
Right. And it's funny, I

333
00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:05.400
was sitting next to someone
on a plane and I

334
00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:08.200
watched him just before. It
was so funny just before

335
00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:11.920
they, they, they said, okay,
we're gonna take off, turn

336
00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:15.610
your phones off. And they
basically like in this kind

337
00:17:15.610 --> 00:17:20.410
of ritualistic way, went into
their iPhone, then, you know,

338
00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:23.860
went into the little task
manager recently used list. And

339
00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:26.530
then just one by one
by one, shut down. Each

340
00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:30.700
of the little apps, not
realizing that they're not shutting

341
00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:33.460
anything down. Right. They're just
kind of clearing their most

342
00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:36.850
recently used cache. And then
they shut the phone down.

343
00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:39.280
It's like, if you want
me to just shut the

344
00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:43.510
phone down, all that happens,
It's also just not necessary.

345
00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:46.720
You know? So it just,
it just seemed a little

346
00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:49.980
bit odd to care about
that kind of stuff. Nice.

347
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:53.520
But the point is though
that even, even as elegant

348
00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:57.990
as the iOS operating system
is they still have that,

349
00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:01.980
that, that sense that this
is how computers work and

350
00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:03.930
they are things running in
the background that you have

351
00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:08.060
to Stop or something bad's
going to happen. Well, it's,

352
00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:12.500
it speaks to a level
of distrust still. Right? Exactly.

353
00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:15.890
And that's a great point.
It's not distrust of Mac

354
00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:19.430
or windows or whatever. It's
distrust of computers. Right. They

355
00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:22.160
are doing something in the
background and we don't trust

356
00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:25.190
them. So we're supposed to
go to tell them to

357
00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:27.140
go away, even though we
didn't actually tell them that,

358
00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:29.090
but it makes us feel
like that. Right. Exactly. What

359
00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:31.070
I do, What I do
when I was overseas is

360
00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:34.100
I just go into background
app refresh and you can

361
00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:36.230
do this on windows as
well. And then just say,

362
00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:39.770
Don't I literally, if you
turn on background app, refresh,

363
00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:42.050
turn it off. Background app,
refresh on an iPhone and

364
00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:45.680
all that background stuff just
stops. Nice batteries last longer.

365
00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:47.840
It's just that apps don't
get updated or it's just

366
00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.000
fine. You actually have to
wait when you flip to

367
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.440
one of those other apps
for it to get the

368
00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:55.220
latest set of data. Exactly.
Exactly. Which for me is

369
00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:58.430
invariably tripled. Oh, is that
the app that you Oh

370
00:18:58.430 --> 00:18:59.960
yeah. That is the thing
that you want the most

371
00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:03.050
updated information from All the
time. And that's, you know,

372
00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:05.000
it's one of those cases
where the windows phone does

373
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.970
a really great job because
the live tile has the

374
00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:10.640
one thing you need to
know about your current travel

375
00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:15.050
on the tile. Yeah. They
announced was it windows phone?

376
00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:19.130
8.1 is coming like any
minute, any minute next month

377
00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:24.440
or so. Yeah. I'm still
carrying around my Lumia 1520.

378
00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:27.710
And I I'm thinking, I
might give it another try

379
00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:31.730
again. The 15, 20 the
plate. Yeah. The it's like

380
00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:35.810
a giant, giant phone, right?
It's like a fablet right.

381
00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:37.670
I call it a bap.
I call it a big

382
00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:40.310
ass phone. I don't like
fablet you don't like big

383
00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:46.100
ass ass phone. I'm afraid.
Bap means other things depending

384
00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:52.670
on who you hang out
with, But okay. Alright. Yeah.

385
00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:56.000
So the conversation I had
at build about the 1520

386
00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.970
was what's douchey. You're holding
that giant phone up to

387
00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:01.040
the side of your face
or using a Bluetooth headset.

388
00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:04.880
Ooh. I'm going to have
to go with Bluetooth. It's

389
00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:07.760
close. It's very close. The
only thing I would say

390
00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:10.790
the 15, 20 lights up
the whole side of your

391
00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:13.530
head when you put it
up there. So it's, it's

392
00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:16.620
quite the thing. It is.
It does look very weird.

393
00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:22.820
I will say that. I,
I feel, I feel conspicuous

394
00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:24.980
when I'm you, when I'm
talking on a phone that

395
00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:29.420
bit That's cause you are
conspicuous when you're on it

396
00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:31.190
for that big, it's a
little bit of a, it's

397
00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:33.560
a little bit of a
problem, but I'm still gonna,

398
00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:36.320
I'm still gonna try it.
You know, if I can

399
00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:39.530
get kind of the Siri
experience with Cortana, then I

400
00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:41.960
think that they may have
caught up. You know what

401
00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:45.020
I mean? Like now they
have reached parody and then

402
00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:48.220
now the real, you know,
the fight happens and Now

403
00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:50.820
things get interesting. Yeah, Yeah,
exactly. That's that's what I

404
00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:52.650
think is going to happen.
Yeah. I'm totally with you.

405
00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:54.750
I think it's a, it's
an interesting time. And they,

406
00:20:54.990 --> 00:21:01.080
they app log is close
enough. Like they both app

407
00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:04.200
stores are disasters. So I
think there are parody there.

408
00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:06.720
He can't find anything. It
doesn't matter where there's a

409
00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:09.810
million apps or 250,000 apps.
You still can't find anything.

410
00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:14.070
Yeah. Yeah. Why people keep
saying the windows doesn't have

411
00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:16.170
the apps, the apps are
they're there. You know what

412
00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:18.690
I mean? That's a, that's
another, another example of a,

413
00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:21.360
a myth that keeps getting
stuck. I mean, they've got,

414
00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:23.550
I don't know, eight out
of 10 of the apps

415
00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:25.590
that I want, Something like
that. They're missing Uber right

416
00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:29.250
now. They keep promising to
Duber will show up. We

417
00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:31.290
were, but you can use
a website can't you? Yeah.

418
00:21:31.410 --> 00:21:32.970
She missed the main, the
main, what do you like?

419
00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:36.150
The thing that's good about
Uber is knowing the cars

420
00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:38.040
coming and exactly where it
is. So you can walk

421
00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:39.480
out as the car pulls
up and that's what you

422
00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:41.370
do. Yeah. With the website.
Oh, I see. Well, but

423
00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:43.830
again, Uber is a thing
that depends on what, where

424
00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:45.720
you live. If you live
in a big town that

425
00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:48.960
has Uber, Uber of course
is a taxi replacement for

426
00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:51.690
those many, many, many people
who are listening, who do

427
00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:56.670
not have Uber. Yes. Once
you've experienced Uber, you know,

428
00:21:56.670 --> 00:21:59.070
it's profound. Yeah. Well, I
mean, if you want to

429
00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:00.810
go somewhere and you live
in a major city, you

430
00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:04.340
just say Uber, but if
you're, you know, overseas in

431
00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:06.630
the smallest town than Uber
doesn't mean anything to you.

432
00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:11.070
Right. Yeah. But, and I,
it's not even your own

433
00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:14.370
town that you care about.
It's when you're traveling. Yeah.

434
00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:18.000
I actually, I have a
$40 Or Uber credits I've

435
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.670
been sitting on and I
only, I only use Uber

436
00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:24.000
when I'm like in Chicago
or some major place where

437
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.410
I needed. Yeah. Well, and
it's, that's exactly what I

438
00:22:28.410 --> 00:22:30.300
mean, you know, the vehicle
is going to be clean,

439
00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:31.710
you know, it's going to
show up when it shows

440
00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:35.580
up. There's no transactional friction.
Uber is addictive. It's really

441
00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:39.510
enjoyable experience. Yeah. Yeah. It
sets the bar for me

442
00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:42.960
on how everything I want
to do. Going forward, interacting

443
00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:46.800
with a customer, looks like
what really low friction transactions

444
00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:51.330
look like. Yeah. He not
to jump around too much.

445
00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:53.070
Do you want to talk
a little led lighting? Cause

446
00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:54.690
you and I were arguing
about this, I don't know,

447
00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:57.870
a month ago. Yeah. I,
I went and I got

448
00:22:57.870 --> 00:23:02.880
some led lighting. It's called
prismatic. Let me see prismatic.

449
00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:06.720
P R I S M
a T I K. It

450
00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:11.010
was, it was a, a
Kickstarter and it's basically four

451
00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:15.480
led strips that run around
the, the back of the

452
00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:19.500
monitor. Neat. And there's a,
there's a little app that

453
00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:22.530
you run and then it
takes about 2% CPU. And

454
00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:25.410
I think they're always working
on lowering. It depends on

455
00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:28.830
how much, how big your
monitor is. Now. I have

456
00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:30.840
a, I have a 30
inch monitor. So it's like,

457
00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:36.030
you know, 2048 by something
big. So it's, it's looking

458
00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:39.510
at the pixels on the
screen in real time and

459
00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:42.030
then determining the color. So
right now I'm looking at

460
00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:46.070
a picture of a field
with blue sky on and

461
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:48.500
green at the bottom. So
then I've got a green

462
00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:51.710
glow out the bottom of
the monitor and a blue

463
00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:54.830
at the top. And literally
as you move a, like

464
00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:56.840
if I took a paint
brush and made a, a

465
00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:59.540
red square, if I moved
it up to the top,

466
00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:01.970
then the, it would be
would, you know, the, the

467
00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:05.900
ambient light would turn red.
The, the Phillips and the

468
00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:08.900
light T V was the
first thing that did this.

469
00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:12.440
So these are basically open
source and do it yourself,

470
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:17.180
examples of ambient ambient light.
And it really works. Yeah.

471
00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:20.230
What does it actually add
to the equation? I mean,

472
00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:22.270
I like the effect and
looking at some of the

473
00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:25.060
videos and things around it,
but you know, how does

474
00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:28.450
it change things? Well, so
they say that it's works

475
00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:30.940
on it and it helps
with eyestrain. Right? I don't

476
00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:33.130
know about that, but it
does. It does give a

477
00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:39.250
sense of the, what's the
word, not a halo, but

478
00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:42.030
there's, there's an aura around
it. Right. There's a large,

479
00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:45.340
a larger glow around the
outside of it implying that

480
00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:47.980
it's somehow bigger than it
is. If you've seen those

481
00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:52.330
videos of the possible versions
of the future, Xbox where

482
00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:54.310
at the end of the
screen is outside the screen.

483
00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:56.920
Yeah. You know, it does
give you that, that feeling

484
00:24:56.920 --> 00:25:00.550
a little bit, like there's
something beyond the inside of

485
00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:03.340
your, your monitor. Yeah. This
is a sense of a

486
00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:06.010
larger surface. It just keeps
on going. Yeah. I like

487
00:25:06.010 --> 00:25:08.560
it. I mean the only
time let me see right

488
00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:11.320
now it's using, it's using
2% CPU right now. Right.

489
00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:13.000
Which sounds like a lot.
And people are like, that's

490
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.580
unacceptable, you know, but I
mean, most of the time

491
00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:19.210
Laying around smoking cigarettes and
playing poker anyway, right. We

492
00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:21.730
are not bound by our
CPS. We are bound by

493
00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:23.920
our Bandwidth. Yeah. Well, I've
started to get a little

494
00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:25.990
bit more of a, of
a cynical attitude about my

495
00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:29.590
CPU. Like if it's not
working, then what is, what

496
00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:30.700
do I have it for?
You know what I mean?

497
00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:33.250
Right. And apparently I have
four of them. So clearly

498
00:25:33.250 --> 00:25:35.200
some of them are goofing
off, give them some to

499
00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:43.780
do Good. 12 logical CPS,
six physical. So I'm willing

500
00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:46.300
to give, you know, a
tiny percentage of one of

501
00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:48.700
those CPS, just because I
liked the effect and for

502
00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:51.310
a dark office, like mine,
it really, really adds a

503
00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:53.740
lot. That's nice. Yeah. I
like it. And then I

504
00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:57.640
run that F Lux. Do
you use this flux? No.

505
00:25:57.730 --> 00:26:00.370
You don't know about this.
Oh, wow. Okay. So flux,

506
00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:03.220
I don't know if it's
flux or efflux, it's F

507
00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:09.310
dot Lux Lux, like for
like light. Right. And you

508
00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:14.470
can get it at, just
get flux.com and basically it's

509
00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:18.340
free software that changes the
color of the computer's display

510
00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:20.890
to adapt to the time
of the day is what

511
00:26:20.890 --> 00:26:23.140
warms it at night. And
it makes it like sunlight

512
00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:24.430
during the day. So if
you ever trying to get

513
00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:27.460
the color, what do you
call it? The color temperature,

514
00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:30.850
correct? It knows where you
are. It looks at the,

515
00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:34.360
you know, it figures out
your Latin lawn and location

516
00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:37.870
or you can tell it
and then it will rise

517
00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:41.650
and set with the sun.
That's awesome. Yeah. So you

518
00:26:41.650 --> 00:26:44.070
have a bright blue coat.
Know what I mean, blue?

519
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:46.980
I mean, the whites are
blue during the day and

520
00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:49.920
then a more warmer kind
of a sun, you know,

521
00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:54.270
sunrise, sunset color at night.
Yeah. Orange, yellow. And it's

522
00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:58.260
lovely because at night you
want that it's less, it's

523
00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:01.160
less bright on your eyes
if you're doing it A

524
00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:04.670
long time on my wind
seven at machine, my background

525
00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:09.200
was a map of the
world with the day, night

526
00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:12.980
line. Correct. And the clouds
accurate. Yeah. Because you know,

527
00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:15.290
I'm always calling all over
the planet. So just being

528
00:27:15.290 --> 00:27:16.970
at a glance and say,
Hey, I'm calling Amsterdam. Oh,

529
00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:19.940
it's dark there it's night
there. You know? And in

530
00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:21.620
fact, being able to see
the clouds over to, he

531
00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:24.550
goes, it's probably raining there
too. Yeah, Absolutely. I love

532
00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:26.540
I. What was that app
called? It used to run

533
00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:29.250
in the background. It covered
up your desktop. It was

534
00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:31.210
there. The whole backer. Yeah.
It doesn't work on wind

535
00:27:31.210 --> 00:27:34.100
eight. So I've had to
give it up, but it,

536
00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:35.510
yeah, I can't remember the
name of it now. And

537
00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:38.030
it makes me sad. My
favorite thing on earth, it

538
00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:40.670
was a dynamic earth. Wallpaper's
like a dynamic earth wallpaper.

539
00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:44.390
And my favorite thing was
every, so often the satellites

540
00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:47.690
capture some, a photo of
something reentering. So you get

541
00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:51.350
this, you get this white
streak across the ocean and

542
00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:52.580
you do, and you could
say, you know, I'd walk

543
00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:55.010
up. The screen would come
up and you're like, Hey,

544
00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:58.640
something reentered today. Well, here,
there's an application here called

545
00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:04.160
earth view from, from a
desk soft. And it looks

546
00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:08.030
like it will work on
windows eight. They just added

547
00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:10.790
windows eight support and it
will change. It will update

548
00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:12.380
the, so it may not
be dynamic, but it's at

549
00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:14.990
least going to update and
they've got a, a free

550
00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:16.750
download here. So I'm gonna
check that out. Or if

551
00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:19.670
you have This sure. Seems
like the same one. Yeah.

552
00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:22.520
And maybe they've now added
when it support. It looks

553
00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:25.880
like they've got Dave unite
view cloud cities. So it's,

554
00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:28.220
you know, it's, it's dynamic
ish and they'll update it

555
00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:31.610
every, you know, every X
minutes. Nice. So that, that

556
00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:34.910
might work. And then they've
also got, it looks like

557
00:28:34.910 --> 00:28:39.140
multiple monitors support. So that's
a desk, soft.com. I'm actually

558
00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:42.320
installing it right now. I
love that. You just go

559
00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:44.780
for it. I mean, it
seems like a good idea,

560
00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:48.350
right? Yeah. So why not?
Right here we go. Start

561
00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:54.140
earth view and go. Okay.
And it's going to go

562
00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:58.580
on it's. So it's running
in the background, seasonal extracting

563
00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:01.490
and preparing image data re
Oh wow. Look at this

564
00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:05.510
rescaling clouds. So this thing
is actually rendering this locally

565
00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:09.530
and then looking at weather
data, generating cloud map, and

566
00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:13.070
then, Oh, wow. Look at
that. Yeah. This is lovely.

567
00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:18.680
Okay. This wins Sold. Sold.
Yes. Yeah. It's got the,

568
00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:21.170
this is nice. Cause it's
got the lights underneath, you

569
00:29:21.170 --> 00:29:24.410
know, where the cities are.
Sure. Yeah. I like that.

570
00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:27.380
I like that. Oh wow.
It is other there's other

571
00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:31.340
high detailed maps you can
download. Yep. Alright. This wins.

572
00:29:31.910 --> 00:29:34.670
See, I love that stuff.
Yeah. Me too. I mean,

573
00:29:35.030 --> 00:29:37.160
I like the idea that
down in my basement is

574
00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:38.990
a machine that's connecting me
to the world in a

575
00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:41.800
lot of different ways. Yeah,
absolutely. They be ups. My

576
00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:44.050
perception of what's going on
in the world, you know?

577
00:29:44.130 --> 00:29:46.260
Yes. It is. It's important
to remember how big it

578
00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:48.150
is. Like we were talking
about why we can't find

579
00:29:48.150 --> 00:29:51.660
this airplane. Yes. And you
know, I don't know anything

580
00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:55.230
about, you know, airplanes or
aviation, you know, I just

581
00:29:55.230 --> 00:29:57.480
know that the more that
I travel, the more that

582
00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:01.680
I realize that it is
a big freaking World, it's

583
00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:04.440
a very, very big pot.
The chances are the reason

584
00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:07.080
that we cannot find this
thing is that the ocean

585
00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:10.880
is bigger than anyone. Anyone
realizes it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

586
00:30:10.890 --> 00:30:14.430
We completely forget. And now
arguably aircraft make that worse.

587
00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:18.150
You know, you in a
day did a journey that

588
00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:21.450
a hundred years ago was
months and 200 years ago

589
00:30:21.450 --> 00:30:25.440
was years. Oh yeah. Oh
yeah. People, people don't realize

590
00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:27.960
like we have more so
and so that the average

591
00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:32.670
middle class person has more
power now than like, you

592
00:30:32.670 --> 00:30:34.830
know, Henry the eighth. Sure.
You know what I mean?

593
00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:37.710
If you think about like
the things that were, you

594
00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:39.390
know, like, you know, bring
me some food, you know,

595
00:30:39.390 --> 00:30:41.730
like stuff like that, or,
you know, you eat it,

596
00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:43.770
you can eat pretty much
anything you want whenever you

597
00:30:43.770 --> 00:30:46.010
want, you just go get
it. Yeah. And it's, and

598
00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:48.810
it represents a tiny fraction
of your income. Yeah. It's

599
00:30:48.810 --> 00:30:51.900
just the exact deal. It's
amazing. Yeah. It is. It

600
00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:54.300
is astonishing, but how far
we've come and so little

601
00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:58.020
time, but yeah. And I'm,
and I feel for the

602
00:30:58.020 --> 00:31:00.420
people who are her missile
missing loved ones, but I'm

603
00:31:00.690 --> 00:31:03.750
pretty sure that we're not
going to find that airplane.

604
00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:07.170
Do you think that it
is just landed in the

605
00:31:07.170 --> 00:31:10.920
ocean and it just, Yeah.
I'd probably broken up the

606
00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:13.800
chances that had actually land
needs it's pieces in the,

607
00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:18.390
in the bottom of the
Indian ocean, the, the analysis

608
00:31:18.390 --> 00:31:20.490
that came out of Inmarsat
of how they looked at

609
00:31:20.490 --> 00:31:23.940
the raw telemetry from those
engines. So they really use

610
00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:27.510
the Doppler shift to figure
out almost exactly it's course

611
00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:30.600
and the partial record that
originally didn't see until he

612
00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:33.150
looked at the raw data.
That means it was, it

613
00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:35.520
was actually trying to negotiate
a penguin. It went offline

614
00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:38.310
and makes it pretty clear
about where it went down.

615
00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:40.950
It just took time to
figure all that out. So

616
00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:42.810
you think that there's going
to have to go look

617
00:31:42.810 --> 00:31:45.480
for it? Yes. But you
know, the reality is that

618
00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:47.550
it's been a month, the,
the pingers aren't going to

619
00:31:47.550 --> 00:31:49.890
be working much. They probably
not working. Now, if they're

620
00:31:49.890 --> 00:31:52.500
working, you know, They implied
that they got a ping

621
00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:54.180
and it might, they may
have like a day or

622
00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:57.210
two of paying loan. Yeah.
Well the Chinese said they

623
00:31:57.210 --> 00:32:01.140
picked up a ping. Oh
really? Yeah. So nobody's else

624
00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:03.960
has been able to reproduce
it yet, but we'll see,

625
00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:06.690
that is a very oblique
part of the ocean. It

626
00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:09.330
is not an easy environment
to operate in. So this

627
00:32:09.330 --> 00:32:11.640
is a pretty remote. Someone
said that it's about the

628
00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:15.090
size of all of the
United States. So, you know, imagine

629
00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:19.200
the United States completely, you know,
flat and empty and say,

630
00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:22.350
we've lost a plane. It's
somewhere in this general area.

631
00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:26.040
Right. And it's not flat
and empty. It is windy

632
00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:29.670
and massive waves and very
violent in the thing you

633
00:32:29.670 --> 00:32:33.690
dropped is moving. Right. Exactly.
And by the way, we're

634
00:32:33.690 --> 00:32:36.450
not talking about a flat
two dimensional plane. Let's go

635
00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:39.410
ahead and make it 200
meters deep. Yeah. Well it's

636
00:32:40.670 --> 00:32:43.730
3000 meters deep. It's it's
worse. Oh, it is three

637
00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:47.180
very deep ocean. There is
a very, very deep and

638
00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:49.850
largely unexplored. There's nothing down
there. That's why they keep

639
00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:52.640
drying squids down there. Oh,
that was a giant squids.

640
00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:57.470
Yeah. Aliens are there. That's
right. It's very deep oceans.

641
00:32:57.470 --> 00:33:01.130
That's also, that's the big
fault lines for the massive

642
00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:04.190
earthquakes. Like it's theirs. It's
not a good place. That's

643
00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:07.970
amazing. That's kind of a
downer to end on. Yeah.

644
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:16.060
Sorry about that. I'm just
like, yeah. Oh, well, you

645
00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:18.670
know, what I do appreciate
is that many countries have

646
00:33:18.670 --> 00:33:20.710
come together with, I mean,
the best submarines in the

647
00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:22.510
world are down there right
now to try and actually

648
00:33:22.510 --> 00:33:24.430
find it. If there's any
chance at all, this is

649
00:33:24.430 --> 00:33:27.040
not a halfhearted move. The
British sent down one of

650
00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:31.510
the thresher classes. There's, there's
three different side scanning systems

651
00:33:31.510 --> 00:33:33.130
that this is the, you
know, this is the kind

652
00:33:33.130 --> 00:33:36.040
of skillset that found the
Titanic and the Bismark. And

653
00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:38.110
it's like the, it's not
going to be a good

654
00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:41.140
story, but at least we
might get some closure. Yeah.

655
00:33:41.170 --> 00:33:43.360
That's a good point. The
fact that no, one's talked

656
00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:45.190
about how much it's going
to cost or who's paying

657
00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:47.950
for it. It's just, it's
getting done. That is heartening

658
00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:51.040
aspect of it. The Australian
Navy, the us Navy, the

659
00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:55.000
Indian Navy, like there's a
tremendous number of ships and

660
00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.140
aircraft and huge numbers of
people. And yeah, it's true.

661
00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:02.470
Just to try and get
an answer. Yeah, absolutely. Well,

662
00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:05.140
thanks for minutia. Hang with
me again, Richard. I appreciate

663
00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:07.720
it. Always. My pleasure. My
friend. We'll do this again.

664
00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:10.150
I'm sure. All right. This
has been another episode. The

665
00:34:10.150 --> 00:34:12.190
cancer we'll see you again
next week.
