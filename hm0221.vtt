00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:17.730
From Hanselman it's dot com.
It's Hanselminutes our weekly discussion

2
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.930
with web developer and technologist
Scott Hanselman. This is Lawrence Ryan

3
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.050
announcing show number two 21.
Recorded live Thursday, July 9th, 2010. Support

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.410
for Hanselman it's just provided
by teller rad controls, the

5
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.220
most comprehensive suite of components
for windows forms and asp.net

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:44.310
web applications online@wwwdottelerik.com. In this
episode of Hansel minutiae, Scott

7
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:49.290
talks with Dan Fernandez. Hi,
this is Scott Hanselman, and

8
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.230
this is another episode of
Hansel minutes. And this week

9
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.620
it's Hansel minutia. It's a
totally random show. And instead

10
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.460
of Richard Campbell today, we've got
Dan Fernandez who is a

11
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.630
dying of either the common
cold or the common flu.

12
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.720
How are you, Dan? I'm
doing good, thanks to modern

13
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.580
medicine and DayQuil, which clearly
overdosed. So I will be

14
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.300
just smiling and laughing today.
And by DayQuil you mean

15
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.460
like a fifth of vodka
or is this an actual

16
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.540
vehicle? I mean, actual DayQuil.
I love, I got to

17
00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.430
say DayQuil is one of
those things that just works,

18
00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.480
works on my body. So
I feel wonderful. I look

19
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.810
in a mirror and I
look more attractive. There's you

20
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.720
know, I just, I just
love it. You're already freakishly

21
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.840
tall. So I guess you
couldn't be any taller. Okay.

22
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.870
I seems like I've been
going to the gym, you

23
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.720
know, the whole works, man.
I there's something about Dateline

24
00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.820
and don't get me started
on NyQuil. You know, if

25
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.400
you, if we ever need
to hibernate as a species,

26
00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.060
all we need is a
nickel address and Yeah. NyQuil

27
00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.480
is what they use when
you're, when you're doing long

28
00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.330
time sleep. You know, if
you're going between star systems,

29
00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.950
I think it was actually
featured in aliens or, or

30
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.670
they should have had some
nice product placement and thought

31
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.030
about it. Absolutely. All right.
So just because we're both

32
00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.550
Microsoft employees and we're gonna
talk about random stuff, remember

33
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.360
that the show's not Microsoft
show and all this is

34
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.900
our opinions and if you
want anyone fired, get Dan

35
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.080
fired, but this is not
Microsoft talking. This is a

36
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.190
DayQuil inspired Dan and I'm
hopped up on about three

37
00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.660
diet Cokes and it's not
yet nine. So certainly certainly

38
00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.830
the disclaimer, disclaimer, blah, blah,
blah. So did you, did

39
00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.740
you stand in line for
an iPhone four, Dan? You

40
00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.700
know, I didn't, I I'm,
I have to say. And

41
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.000
maybe it's just cause I've
been playing with windows phone,

42
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.270
but I'm actually really excited
about windows phone seven. No,

43
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.090
are you serious? I mean,
you were only three minutes

44
00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.620
into the thing and the
fan boy as I'm in

45
00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.130
the Microsoft and whatnot has
already started up. Yeah. Well,

46
00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.090
I mean, so I have
to say Clint and I

47
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.740
are lucky in that. We're
probably one of the only

48
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.720
people that have gotten to
use a windows phone and

49
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.720
you know, we, we go
and they flash the phone

50
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.350
with new OOS. And obviously
I can't say some of

51
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.840
the stuff on there, but
it's, it's just coming along

52
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.760
really well. And I think
the big thing is just

53
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.370
how nice it is to
program. Like being able to

54
00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:30.220
program silver light is really
nice that the one web

55
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.440
app we're looking at doing,
or I'm looking at doing

56
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.870
for coding for fun is
the how to get out

57
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:40.240
of a bad date. It's
basically you set up the

58
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.860
phone and it'll fake a
ring and it'll fake the

59
00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.140
color ID message. So, you
know, you can say like

60
00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.510
bill Gates is calling and,
you know, have some phone

61
00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.300
number, whatever. And it basically
looks exactly like the phone.

62
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.170
So, you know, based on
some timers, say, you know,

63
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.990
within three minutes, I want
you to start ringing or

64
00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.710
vibrating or whatever your, your
phone happens to use. And

65
00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.320
that way you can say
like, Oh geez, I got

66
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.090
to get out of this
meeting or, Oh, I gotta

67
00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.190
get out of this bad
date. You know, bill Gates

68
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:14.620
is calling. But again, I
think it's just cause I'm

69
00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.230
a, I'm a dev nerd
and several, it is really

70
00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.690
cool. So, but that's why
I don't have an iPhone

71
00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.520
four. So you're actually have
like a windows phone or

72
00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.360
you're borrowing one or you
have borrowed one. No, we,

73
00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:32.820
we have one from the
windows phone team it's kind

74
00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.530
of shared between Clinton NY.
So we don't like our,

75
00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.620
we only put in our
SIM like for demos and

76
00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.890
stuff. Then my day to
day phone is, is an

77
00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:49.380
old school windows when it
was windows mobile phone. But

78
00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.180
we get to play with
a windows phone quite a

79
00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.220
bit. Can you make a
call? Does that actually work?

80
00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.190
I've never seen one actually
dial. Yeah. Yeah. I mean

81
00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:01.770
the whole word you put
in your SIM trying to

82
00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.630
make sure what other stuff
I, you know, there's stuff.

83
00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.890
I can't say the whole
thing works. You know, there's

84
00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:14.700
an interesting article on, on
MSDN. I will put this

85
00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.370
in the show notes by
a guy named Jim Gallison

86
00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.760
and he did this yesterday
and it's called a tale

87
00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.570
of four frameworks and he
basically sits down and writes

88
00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:29.970
the same trivial, but interesting
polygon application in four frameworks,

89
00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.520
he does it in comm
and C plus plus ATL.

90
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.860
He then does it on
Android with the Android emulator

91
00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.830
in Java. Then he does
it on a windows phone

92
00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.070
and then he does it
as an active X control.

93
00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:50.340
And it's, it's really, it's
really interesting. And he's got

94
00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.800
the code for each of
them, like how to write

95
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.720
an X of X control
and what's good and what's

96
00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.410
bad and all the active
X crap and he kind

97
00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.500
of walks through the whole
thing, go, does it an

98
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.190
Android and does it in
Java and then walks through

99
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:06.980
doing it in XAML. And
he looks at the emulators

100
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.500
and he looks at the,
with the experiences like it

101
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.600
looks at the code and
then he shows you all

102
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.270
four of these applications, all
living next to each other

103
00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.410
and basically has like a,
a chart talking about like,

104
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.800
well, how much code is
there and how complicated is

105
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.780
the IDE? And what's the
graphics and what are the

106
00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:28.190
abstractions and low level for
comm mid-level for Android. And

107
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:31.220
high-level for server Lite. It's
pretty interesting. All the code

108
00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:34.180
is available. So, so is
it pretty clear from that

109
00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.230
article? Like, Hey, wow, this
is the easiest one. Or,

110
00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:43.270
or, you know, this one
or It's tough because what

111
00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:46.630
he's application does is it
draws a polygon and then

112
00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:50.110
puts a circle around it.
So some languages are better

113
00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:54.130
for that. Like that's one
line in Silverlight, but that's

114
00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:59.350
not fair. Right? It's only
one line in, in Java.

115
00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:03.310
It's like a couple of
lines in ATL. It's five

116
00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:08.380
lines then of course it's
five lines to the polygon,

117
00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.980
not, not the 40 different
files and bitmaps and resources

118
00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:15.790
and IDL files and all
the other crap. But I

119
00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:18.430
don't think that it's a
fair comparison, although it does

120
00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:20.800
give you an idea of
what starting out a project

121
00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.590
would be. The real question
would be like, you know,

122
00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:27.440
write a Tetris game and
then go all out on

123
00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:28.870
all four of them. But
I thought that was kind

124
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:31.750
of an interesting, interesting thing.
The real question will be,

125
00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:37.330
will people start using people
will start using windows phone

126
00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:39.190
if they can make money
on windows phone. Right? I

127
00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:40.630
mean, ultimately that's how it
comes down to you. Like

128
00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:42.940
if you look at the
TOB T I O B

129
00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:46.420
E stuff that came out
last week, objective C a

130
00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:48.640
TOB is a language ranking
system and they show you

131
00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.160
like whether our language is
going up or going down

132
00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.790
in popularity and objective C
is like way, way up

133
00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:58.300
and objective C is hard
and not fun, but you

134
00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:00.130
know, it can be hard,
not fun. I'll write it

135
00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:03.790
in assembler. If it can
make me money, you know

136
00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:06.190
what I mean? So if
you can make money, Probably

137
00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:08.950
one of the challenges that
windows phone will have is

138
00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:13.990
the developer store will be
awesome. The real question is

139
00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:17.950
whether we can convince consumers
to buy the phone, cause

140
00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:22.450
that's the, that's what developers
want as a target to

141
00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:24.430
buy your application. So if
you can get them into

142
00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:27.040
those consumers to buy the
phone, then you have a,

143
00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:32.140
a target market. Yeah. You
know, there's a, there's an

144
00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:35.710
article in a magazine called
the globe and mail. It's

145
00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:39.850
a, I think it's an
English thing and they're listing

146
00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:45.250
out a dead technology companies.
And the guy starts out

147
00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:48.340
in this article saying that
Microsoft can now be added

148
00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:52.540
to the list of defunct
companies like abandoned railroad lines.

149
00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:59.660
He says that that the
$200 billion company is finished. Is

150
00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:02.180
there a sarcasm or why?
No, he's totally, he's totally

151
00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:04.880
serious. He says, it's like
working for a large bureaucracy

152
00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:08.810
and no one wants to
work there. It's pretty sad.

153
00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.970
That was kind of like,
I was like really sucks.

154
00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:12.530
You read a lot of
this stuff. It makes you

155
00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:16.160
mean, I don't know. The
thing is there's like Dan

156
00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.860
as a Microsoft employee. And
again, this will be, I'll

157
00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:21.560
be here almost three years
in October. It's it's cool

158
00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:23.570
because you work here and
you're happy when we do

159
00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:28.580
something cool, like, like natal,
which is now called connect.

160
00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:30.590
The, the cool thing for
the Xbox. It lets you,

161
00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:33.080
you know, our X-Box motion
control, but then we do

162
00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:34.790
stuff like we start the
kin and then we kill

163
00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:36.530
it in a day later.
And it just like, Oh

164
00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:40.190
man, we're such a big
company. You're really excited one

165
00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:43.400
day. And you really sad
the next day. Yeah. You

166
00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:48.410
know, it's one of those
weird things where you kind

167
00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:52.550
of do the roller coaster
on that company. It really

168
00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:57.230
depends. I I'd probably say
outside the biggest complaints on

169
00:09:57.230 --> 00:10:01.210
Microsoft and a lot of
these stories are, are, are

170
00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:03.740
not so much on our
enterprise stuff, but really on

171
00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:09.500
our consumer angle. Right? So
obviously on the windows mobile

172
00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:14.060
front, we have a lot
to catch up on. You

173
00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:19.610
know, you mentioned the, can
you look at people as

174
00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:23.420
they train comparison to the
stuff that we're doing for

175
00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:27.620
browsers, where they feel like,
Hey, you know, I nine

176
00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:29.960
has a lot of catch
up work to do, but

177
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:31.640
then you look at the
other side, which is more

178
00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:35.120
like our enterprise business. And
that enterprise business is booming.

179
00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:38.780
I mean, you look at
SQL server in terms of

180
00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:42.140
either sales or units, you
know, it's awesome. SharePoint is

181
00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:47.060
our fastest billion dollar business
ever. Our dev tool business

182
00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:55.340
is always great. Windows, seven
fastest licensing, fastest version of

183
00:10:55.340 --> 00:11:00.020
windows that's ever sold ever.
So more licenses sold than

184
00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:04.040
any other version of windows.
So it's not all bad.

185
00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:06.920
And it just seems kinda
more of the doom and

186
00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:10.610
gloom on some of the
consumer stuff, because that's really

187
00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:16.130
what people end up seeing.
Yeah. People always accuse us

188
00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:19.940
also of making a new
wheel. I found this article

189
00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:23.960
called eight reasons for reinventing
the wheel. So that was

190
00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:26.120
pretty cool. Cause we're always
like, Oh, you should stop

191
00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:29.420
reinventing. The wheel. Engineers are
always reinventing the wheel, but

192
00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:32.510
here are eight actual reasons
that it's appropriate for Microsoft

193
00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:36.440
or someone else to make
the wheel. Like I am

194
00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:42.560
a wheel engineer. My wheel
is better than your wheel,

195
00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:46.070
right? This is also closely
related to the programming virtues

196
00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:51.230
of laziness, inpatients and hubris.
These are the three programmer

197
00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:54.040
virtues. Have you heard about
these? Well, I do know

198
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:58.750
The laziness and I don't
say them again and give

199
00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:03.690
the overview Laziness. This is
the energy expenditure, right? The

200
00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:06.930
first grade virtue of a
programmer and then an impatience.

201
00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:09.990
This is a makes you
write programs that do stuff

202
00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:12.270
because you know, the computer
is wrong. Therefore I'm in

203
00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:15.480
patient. I will write myself
and then hubris, which has

204
00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:18.990
excessive pride. They also, they
throw, this is the thing

205
00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:22.020
that makes you write and
maintain programs that other people

206
00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:23.580
would never write because you
think you can do it

207
00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:26.100
better. Yeah. My version though
is going to be better.

208
00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:30.090
Exactly. And then also boredom
is another good reason to

209
00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:34.770
reinvent a new wheel. We
should send this to some

210
00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:39.000
of the, some of the
bosses. Did you see the,

211
00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:43.800
the new YouTube lean-back stuff?
No, it's the YouTube lean-back

212
00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:47.310
stuff. So you know about
like 10 foot, they call

213
00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:49.800
it a 10 foot interface.
This is when you, when

214
00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:52.080
you want to watch TV
on your computer, like windows

215
00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:55.620
media center, this is when
you lean back and just

216
00:12:55.620 --> 00:13:00.210
let the videos play. So
if you go to youtube.com/lean

217
00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:04.710
back, it's an all new
interface that is effectively like

218
00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:11.880
YouTube TV. It just plays
YouTube videos from your preferences

219
00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:15.900
and things that you might
like uses the arrow keys

220
00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:20.400
on the keyboard and you
just have to lean back.

221
00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:25.320
Yeah. It's new. It's interesting.
So I've, I've tried plugging

222
00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:29.940
in my, my laptop with
HTMI and then just kind

223
00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:33.180
of like letting it watch
and you know, it's as

224
00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:37.890
horrible as you think it
would be. Cause it's just

225
00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:42.750
totally random. Like first it
brought up that very nice

226
00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:46.200
lady who sang with Michael Jackson
at his Memorial. And she

227
00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:49.020
did like a thing of,
we are the world and

228
00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:52.050
that was nice. Right. And
then it was the next,

229
00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:54.390
the next thing was the
end credit themes to the

230
00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:57.840
TV show Chuck. So I'm
like, okay. So I was

231
00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:00.300
all like, Oh wow, this
is amazing. It's Judith Hill singing.

232
00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:02.070
We are the world. That
was really so special. Thank

233
00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:05.460
you, YouTube. And then the
lead then boom, next video.

234
00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:09.090
The end credit themes of
Chuck. Yeah. You know, I

235
00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:11.850
have to say, unfortunately, some
of these things and I'll

236
00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:16.020
use TiVo as the other
example, especially if it's using

237
00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:19.290
a, your prefaces and based
on what you vote, it

238
00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:22.230
will unfortunately show you just
how boring a person you

239
00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:27.090
actually are by, by, by
algorithms. Because what that's doing

240
00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:29.670
is probably looking at your
ratings, looking at your favorites.

241
00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:34.500
People also liked, and TiVo
used to do this where,

242
00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:38.280
where people would get upset
where, you know, they'd rate

243
00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:42.900
some shows. And then all
of a sudden their TiVo

244
00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:46.650
would record suggested videos that
were, you know, terrible. It's

245
00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:50.490
like, no, I, I, I
don't like watching chick flicks.

246
00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:52.730
Why, why you telling me
this? Just because I like

247
00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:56.920
tech guy for the regular
guy, That's exactly what happens.

248
00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:59.350
My TiVo still thinks I'm
gay three years later from

249
00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:03.490
watching some, some, some stuff.
Not that there's anything wrong

250
00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:05.530
with that. I just, you
know, it's like bad TiVo,

251
00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:09.940
bad TiVo. Yeah, exactly. But
it's a, it's a, unfortunately,

252
00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:13.840
when we, when we see
ourselves reflected by technology, by

253
00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:16.750
an algorithm, it is a,
is a horrible image to

254
00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:19.150
see. Yeah. I don't know
why this shoe channel keeps

255
00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:22.990
coming up. I'm kind of
somehow it thinks that that's

256
00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:26.670
appropriate. I don't know why.
Yeah. It's a problem. But

257
00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:33.280
a youtube.com/lean lean back. One
of the exciting things that

258
00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:36.070
I have to say is,
and, and I think it's

259
00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:40.150
going to happen really soon
that it's gonna change everything.

260
00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:45.070
Is everything really being online.
So if you saw the

261
00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:52.360
announcement Hulu plus is there,
there, you know, prime time

262
00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:59.110
shows NBC, ABC, I believe
CVS too is going to

263
00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:02.140
be available as a subscription
for nine 95 a month.

264
00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:04.420
You can watch, you know,
instant shows. You don't have

265
00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:08.620
to wait everything's available in
their archive and they're going

266
00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:11.960
to have like connections for
X-Box and I've never felt

267
00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:14.530
it. Yeah. I have this
high, a buddy of mine

268
00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:17.560
who works at Hulu hooked
me up. Oh really? So

269
00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:20.710
tell me about this. Cause
so here's the thing. If

270
00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:25.450
you have this and say
Netflix, why at that point

271
00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:30.640
you don't really need say
a Comcast cable. Hi, this

272
00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:33.370
is Scott. I just want
to remind you guys that

273
00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:36.760
there's no show without a
sponsor. Someone who's got to

274
00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:39.430
pay for all this bandwidth.
And the more popular the

275
00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:42.220
show becomes. The more important
is that we thank our

276
00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:46.450
sponsors folks like Tellerik I
wanna let you guys know

277
00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:49.030
that Tellerik has got a
pretty cool deal going between

278
00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:56.530
June 1st, 2010 and August 31st, 2010. Any interested
listener, just send an email

279
00:16:56.530 --> 00:17:05.380
to podcast@telleriktlerik.com mentioned Hansel minutes
and they will reply. And

280
00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:09.130
they'll give you a special
$50 off coupon code. So

281
00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:13.960
just remember podcast at <inaudible>
dot com mentioned Hansel minutes,

282
00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:19.990
$50 off. This goes until
August 31st, 2010 and big thanks again

283
00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:22.510
for the folks at Tellerik
for believing in our show

284
00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:27.160
and for continuing to help
pay for our expenses. Well,

285
00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:29.560
so here's the thing, right?
So I have this and

286
00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:32.740
it lets you watch. So
there's Hulu, which is, we

287
00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:34.510
know what Hulu is and
who lets you watch like

288
00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:37.240
the last couple of episodes
of a show. So if

289
00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:38.560
I want to watch, like
one of the shows I'm

290
00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:41.410
watching now is called modern
family. I want to watch

291
00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:44.290
modern family. Hulu will show
me the last five episodes

292
00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:47.110
for free. I don't need
to pay anyone to see

293
00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:50.670
the last five episodes. If
I want the entire season,

294
00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:55.050
I paid 10 bucks to
Hulu plus. Now here's the

295
00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:56.940
part that school, it's not
10 bucks for the entire

296
00:17:56.940 --> 00:18:00.420
season of that one show.
It's 10 bucks for the

297
00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:02.970
entire season of their entire
library of shows. So it's

298
00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:05.640
like the entire season of,
you know, like all five

299
00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:10.260
seasons of lost or whatever.
And there's like dozens and

300
00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:13.940
dozens and dozens of shows,
including shows you've forgotten, you

301
00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:16.140
know, shows that were canceled.
You want to watch like

302
00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:21.090
all 12 million seasons of arrested
development or whatever it's available

303
00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:23.400
and you can watch it
on your phone, on your

304
00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:27.180
PlayStation. They say, it'll be
on Xbox next year. Yada

305
00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:33.620
yada yada. All right. So
the question is, is a

306
00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:37.820
purchase by show, not a
subscription. No, no, it's, it's

307
00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:41.270
a lease. It's kind of
like zoom. I can watch

308
00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:44.570
all seven. I don't know
how many episodes, all seven

309
00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:47.630
seasons of lost. Anytime I
want, as long as I

310
00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:49.670
pay them 10 bucks a
month, I can't download it.

311
00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:53.450
Okay. So it's like, well,
I guess that's what I

312
00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:56.690
meant is it's more like
Netflix subscription model. It's all

313
00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:58.760
you can need so long
as you pay the monthly

314
00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:01.580
bill. Right? Exactly. Like the
person that I always compare

315
00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:04.010
it to, to Brad Wilson,
you know, Brad Wilson on

316
00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:06.650
the asp.net team. Whenever I
go over to his house,

317
00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:10.730
he has this amazing DVD
collection and he has ripped

318
00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:14.240
everything. He loves to buy
TV shows. He rips everything

319
00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:18.410
onto a giant, super multi
terabyte server and then runs

320
00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:20.270
it all through Apple TV.
So if you want to

321
00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:23.120
watch a key, he showed
me, he has every single

322
00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:26.930
episode of the West wing
and he's done the work

323
00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:29.690
though. I mean, he ripped
it. He organized the titles,

324
00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:32.270
he made the, the album
art, you know, it's exquisite,

325
00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:34.700
but it represents a lot
of effort, but I can

326
00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:39.470
do that just by, just
by paying, by paying someone

327
00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:41.060
else, 10 bucks to do
it, and then I can

328
00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:43.760
stream it whenever. So like
to your point, the work

329
00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:45.500
has been done. I don't
have to worry about backing

330
00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:47.870
it up. I don't have
to think about the psychic

331
00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:51.530
weight associated with those files,
living on a hard drive

332
00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:54.620
somewhere and worrying about if
they're backed up and maintained

333
00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:57.800
and not corrupted in et
cetera, et cetera. So, yeah,

334
00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:01.070
it's pretty cool. This is
cool. I didn't, I didn't

335
00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:03.320
know yet Hulu plus would
you, would you recommend it?

336
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:05.600
Would you say like, yes,
this is the thing to

337
00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:07.850
do. Cause I mean, the
way I look at it

338
00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:12.530
is as a Netflix subscriber,
I have a Roku and

339
00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:14.930
I absolutely love it. In
fact, you know, it's funny,

340
00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:17.870
you mentioned arrested development. I
was just watching season three

341
00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:23.000
of arrested development the other
day on my TV and

342
00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:26.180
absolutely loved it. And I'm
just wondering why I would

343
00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:30.560
need a cable or subscription
if Hulu plus is good

344
00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:35.090
enough. So the reason is
that in my opinion, is

345
00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:39.050
that there's some show you
can't get. And the, the,

346
00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:41.570
the thing is that I
am having trouble because I

347
00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:45.470
can't get Dexter, which is
on Showtime and I can't

348
00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:49.840
get what's the other show
on true blood on HBO.

349
00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:53.020
So those two shows I
can't get, I have to

350
00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:57.520
wait until later when they
come out on DVD, which

351
00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:00.940
is torturous clearly. So if
I have, I torrent them,

352
00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:03.670
I don't know about people
who are listening, but if

353
00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:06.370
I, or some theoretical Hanselman
out there where to try

354
00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:09.010
and something like this, of
course, I would never advocate

355
00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:13.050
doing something like that. The
theoretical Hanselman there's, We're talking

356
00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:15.630
about a theoretical Hansman. If
some theoretical Hanselman were to

357
00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:18.870
do that and then were
to theoretically get a cease

358
00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:24.990
and desist order from his
ISP and was told, this

359
00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:26.610
is something that you need
to stop doing, or we

360
00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:29.340
will shut you down. I
don't know how people successfully

361
00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:33.840
torn anything anymore. ISP don't
like that. And they always

362
00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:37.950
get, take down orders from
the content owner. Right? So

363
00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:39.930
if you decide to go
and watch an HBO show,

364
00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:41.730
they will find you, I
mean, at the end of

365
00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:44.430
the middle of suing, all
those people who took the

366
00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:48.390
hurt locker. Hmm, no, I
didn't know. You know about

367
00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:51.000
that, the hurt locker movie,
the directors and the people

368
00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.170
who own the hurt locker
have decided to basically not,

369
00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:58.740
not Sue the ISP, not
Sue the holsters, but there's

370
00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:02.100
showing the actual half million
people who downloaded the, the

371
00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:06.750
movie itself. So seriously. I
mean, the thing is, I

372
00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:08.910
think you and I are
getting to is that if

373
00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:11.310
it's a buck or 10
bucks or whatever for an

374
00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:14.460
entire season or many, many
seasons of something, just pay

375
00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:18.270
the money. Well, I mean,
the way I look at

376
00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:22.470
it is if you could
get, say Dexter and true

377
00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:26.070
blood as another option, let's
say it was just $20

378
00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:30.810
to have available online any
time and through your TV

379
00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:34.830
at any time I guarantee
you'd pay it. Yeah. I

380
00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:37.650
mean, we technically are paying
it through Comcast. I think

381
00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:40.680
that the area that gets
me really excited is being

382
00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:45.090
able to watch anytime, anywhere,
any device. I could imagine

383
00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:49.080
that the Hulu plus back
to the mobile scenario, the

384
00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:53.010
Hulu plus, where I can
pull up say modern family

385
00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:57.330
and watch an episode, you
know, while I'm commuting on

386
00:22:57.330 --> 00:23:00.440
a plane or something else
to me, that plane is

387
00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:03.870
a internet connection. Speaking of
that, here's the other thing

388
00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:06.540
it's in the cloud and
that's wonderful and that's magical

389
00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:11.550
except no one ever considers
bandwidth, right? It's just not

390
00:23:11.550 --> 00:23:14.340
reasonable to watch an hour
long TV show over 3g.

391
00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:18.960
Hulu plus has enabled over
3g except at, and T

392
00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:23.970
has kept the bandwidth now
two to two gigs, and

393
00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:26.040
then you have to start
paying after that. So the

394
00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:27.450
idea that I could be
like hanging out at the

395
00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:29.820
local Starbucks, maybe I could
do that. I could use

396
00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:32.490
their wifi, but if I'm
out and about, I can't

397
00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:35.490
really do that in my
experience, traveling all over the

398
00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:40.350
world, bandwidth is a huge
problem. So I'm not sure

399
00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:43.050
what, what magical world that
they imply that we're going

400
00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:44.730
to be living in, that
I'm going to have awesome

401
00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:49.000
bandwidth at every hotel, Same
outside of us in Western

402
00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.810
Europe. You're you're absolutely right.
I remember in being in

403
00:23:52.810 --> 00:23:55.210
Cairo having to go to
the computer room, cause there

404
00:23:55.210 --> 00:23:58.810
were no internet connections in
the, in the room. Exactly,

405
00:23:58.930 --> 00:24:01.950
exactly. It's sitting in the
business center. And then when

406
00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:03.760
you, of course you can't
watch any of these shows

407
00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:06.310
cause they're, they're shut down.
People who are listening from

408
00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:07.960
the U S are like
Hulu, what the heck is

409
00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:13.780
that? We don't have DVRs.
It's a, it seems perfect.

410
00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:16.510
They always have the, you
know, some random guy in

411
00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:19.840
a nice suit on a
subway looking at his iPad.

412
00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:22.660
And I mean, I can't
even get a text message

413
00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:28.180
out on the subway. There's
just no way. Very true.

414
00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:30.520
Very true. I think it
let me pre downloaded ahead

415
00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:33.490
of time maybe, but still,
Well, I think in that

416
00:24:33.490 --> 00:24:35.410
case, like a lot of
times on the, on the

417
00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:38.050
iPad, just to be fair
is that they've downloaded the

418
00:24:38.050 --> 00:24:42.220
video. I'm assuming that they
have, but features like Hulu

419
00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:46.570
plus don't let you do
that. Yeah. Yeah. If you

420
00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:51.880
could find some way to
basically make a secure download,

421
00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:54.610
that would be another area
that would be great where

422
00:24:54.610 --> 00:25:00.100
you could just basically take
your videos with you, you

423
00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:04.990
know, back to some developer
stuff. I, one of the

424
00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:08.620
examples that I had done
before was downloading YouTube videos

425
00:25:08.650 --> 00:25:10.870
just so I could take
them with me like, Hey,

426
00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:13.450
wow, this is, you know,
I want to see the

427
00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:17.200
top 10 videos this month
or whatever, subscribe to that

428
00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.390
feed and be able to
take them with me. And

429
00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:21.100
by take them with me.
I mean, being able to

430
00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:26.290
convert the flash video into
say MP4 or a WMD

431
00:25:26.290 --> 00:25:29.080
and sync them to, you
know, say your Zune or

432
00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:34.300
your PC or whatever. Yeah.
Do you, do you struggle

433
00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:37.720
keeping you have multiple devices?
Like I've got an old

434
00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:41.860
iPod, an 80 gig iPod,
I've got a Zune HD,

435
00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:45.880
I've got an iPhone, I've
got a Zune eight gig.

436
00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:48.730
I've got a deal with
iTunes. I've got to deal

437
00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:51.010
with June and I've got
to deal with MP3s that

438
00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:55.090
I ripped earlier. How do
you manage all that? Yeah.

439
00:25:55.100 --> 00:26:00.010
So I do have the
same problem. Most of my

440
00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:04.210
stuff, is it non DRM?
But I do, like I

441
00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:07.030
had stuff that I had
purchased say on iTunes, you

442
00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:11.650
know, years and years ago
that is still DRM protected

443
00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:13.960
and you know, iTunes, at
least the nice thing it

444
00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:18.010
comes up with, Hey, give
us $200 and we'll convert

445
00:26:18.010 --> 00:26:27.250
the licenses for your old
content. Yeah. Yeah. And there's

446
00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:30.100
obviously the cost depends on
how much music you have

447
00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:33.310
or old music that you
purchase. But the idea is

448
00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:36.070
then that content can kind
of go with you anywhere.

449
00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:39.160
That's pretty frustrating. I mean,
I have had a number

450
00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:42.850
of times when the, the,
the act of just buying

451
00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:45.900
is difficult on an, on
any and all of these

452
00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:49.410
different systems, then I kind
of go, well, gosh, where

453
00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:52.950
did that file go? I've
I've lost the file. Or

454
00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:56.520
then I realized that it's
D it's it's DRM. Once

455
00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:59.340
I realized that I'm actually,
I don't know, it's kind

456
00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:01.170
of a stupid, I should
probably just pick one, I

457
00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:03.510
guess, is what I'm saying.
I like, there's a couple

458
00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:04.890
of different things I've been
listening to lately. I've been

459
00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:09.570
listening to this artist named
Janell Monae and I, I

460
00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:13.590
got her album and then
I grabbed my, my iPhone

461
00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:16.500
and jumped in the car
and then realized that I

462
00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:19.590
downloaded it on Zune and
I hadn't got my Zune

463
00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:23.040
yet. So then that I
was like, well, you know,

464
00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:24.810
what do I buy it
on? How do I just,

465
00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:26.970
I just want my fricking
music. You know what I

466
00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:29.630
mean? I ended up listening
to it on Pandora. Yeah,

467
00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:32.870
I know. I absolutely, you
know, I, I actually tried

468
00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:40.100
Amazon's MP3 purchasing system. Yeah.
It works. I mean, it

469
00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:43.640
works pretty well. The idea
was, Hey, well, I can

470
00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:46.550
get an MP3, not have
to worry about stuff. And

471
00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:51.500
they had, in some cases,
you know, for random music

472
00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:54.650
and by random, I mean,
I, if some like old

473
00:27:54.650 --> 00:28:00.080
school punk rock music, they
had better selection. So I

474
00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:04.130
was able to download it,
did download, it, brings up

475
00:28:04.130 --> 00:28:07.310
and ask you to download
or to use their downloader

476
00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:10.160
tool. You use their downloader
tool and then it dumps

477
00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:12.500
it into place. And, you
know, I'm like looking for

478
00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:14.930
this font. I can't even
find it, but like, that's

479
00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:16.550
probably one of the frustrating
things. And then I had

480
00:28:16.550 --> 00:28:19.340
to copy it over to
the specific directories for the

481
00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:24.950
Zune or the specific directories
for an iPhone, and actually

482
00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:28.190
add that, you know, those,
those files or that file

483
00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:34.010
folder. It really isn't as
integrated as, as I would

484
00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:36.740
want to be. But you
know, with windows phone coming

485
00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:40.250
out, I'm looking to standardize.
If you will, on, on

486
00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:43.220
a Zune, I'd love to
standardize on something. But, but

487
00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:45.140
I, it doesn't change the
fact that I've got like

488
00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:48.350
32 gigs of everything I've
ever owned and ripped from

489
00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:51.850
the first CD that I've
owned, you know, going back

490
00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:55.280
a long way. Do you
have them as a DRM

491
00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:58.250
version or is it just
MP3? I guess they are

492
00:28:58.250 --> 00:29:02.000
MP3s is just spread all
over creation with bad tags

493
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.510
and unknown, unknown this and
unknown that, you know, y'all

494
00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:07.280
just, people always say that,
Oh yeah, I've got my

495
00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:10.160
collection fully tidy and everything
like that. I've got all

496
00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:12.170
of my all album art,
but they only have a

497
00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:14.780
couple of hundred albums. When
you, when you start getting

498
00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:19.900
into album hoarding, it's really,
you have to take, you

499
00:29:19.910 --> 00:29:22.370
have to take time off
work. If you really want

500
00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:25.620
to get your album stuff
set up. What was in

501
00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:27.470
it? Do you remember the
name of the service? Cause

502
00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:30.290
I remember you had given
me the recommendation years ago,

503
00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:36.170
the service to automatically report.
Yeah. Rip digital rip digital.com

504
00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:39.800
is actually how I started.
Well, I, I would suggest

505
00:29:40.210 --> 00:29:44.170
to probably outsource that, that
model for, for managing and

506
00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:48.130
then have them give you
that, give you a, the

507
00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:50.800
disk act. Cause they give
you eight DVDs full of

508
00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:53.610
That's hard. That's hard core.
I could get it. I

509
00:29:53.610 --> 00:29:55.950
could get an assistant who
would go and clean up

510
00:29:55.950 --> 00:29:58.770
like a human. I would
do a mechanical Turk style.

511
00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:03.750
Hey, speaking of assistance, did
you know that James James, James

512
00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:06.540
sr, who works in DP?
Do you know that he

513
00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:10.560
has a virtual assistant? No.
No it does. He had

514
00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:14.160
the year men in India.
He has, I think it's,

515
00:30:14.330 --> 00:30:17.820
I'm checking here. It's called
time saver. And I think

516
00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:21.960
it's time SVR. Yeah, here
it is. T I M

517
00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:29.160
S vr.com. Apparently it's hip
to drop vowels. So he,

518
00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:34.860
he pays for time-saver personal
that says unlimited basic tasks,

519
00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:40.560
24, seven service by phone,
email, web or Skype. And

520
00:30:40.790 --> 00:30:42.390
I was like, well, what
do you, what do you

521
00:30:42.390 --> 00:30:46.290
possibly have to get done?
I tease him because he's

522
00:30:46.290 --> 00:30:49.500
also English, which, which is
fun. Cause it's fun to

523
00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:59.550
teach English people with their
accents and David <inaudible>. He

524
00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:03.180
was moving and he was
in China, but he was

525
00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:05.280
moving from one place in
Seattle to another place in

526
00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:09.690
Seattle. And he had his
guy at time-saver go and

527
00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:13.800
research movers, get quotes, put
all the quotes into an

528
00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:16.770
Excel sheet and like build
some charts and graphs describing

529
00:31:17.730 --> 00:31:20.450
which of these was the
best. Then once they decided

530
00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:24.180
it, he scheduled the time
with the, with the guy

531
00:31:25.050 --> 00:31:29.160
and basically this gentlemen somewhere
overseas, I don't know where

532
00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:33.900
did all this work for
him? And I was like,

533
00:31:33.930 --> 00:31:35.940
really? I don't really think
I'd feel comfortable having a

534
00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:42.900
random guy in another country,
pick, pick my mover. And

535
00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:44.760
you know, I mean, cause
he has to know everything,

536
00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:46.800
isn't know your address and
where, where you hit the

537
00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:50.760
key and just all this
kind of stuff swears by

538
00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:52.530
it. He says, it's the
greatest thing he's ever done

539
00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:56.580
to save time is to,
to hire these guys. He

540
00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:58.770
had them send flowers to
his girlfriend on their anniversary.

541
00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:05.130
Yeah. The, the, I know
a similar service it's called

542
00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:08.190
your man in india.com. Oh,
I thought you were just

543
00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:11.970
being like, I don't know.
I thought that was being

544
00:32:11.970 --> 00:32:16.020
offensive. It's an actual thing.
Yeah. And so there's a

545
00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:21.510
book by a guy named
Timothy Ferris four hour work

546
00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:27.270
week. Yeah. I had him
on the show. Yeah. I

547
00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:30.810
met him at, at a
food camp. Super interesting guy,

548
00:32:30.810 --> 00:32:33.390
but moral of the story
is, you know, he talks

549
00:32:33.390 --> 00:32:36.330
about like outsourcing a lot
of your life and, and

550
00:32:36.810 --> 00:32:39.560
you know that you're spending
your time most your time

551
00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:42.590
doing, you know, menial work
or, or something that somebody

552
00:32:42.590 --> 00:32:45.230
else can do. Say for
example, you take a day

553
00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:47.900
off of work to clean
up your, your music for

554
00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:50.840
example. But he mentioned your
man in India just cause

555
00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:53.960
the cost is so cheap
from say, you know, doing

556
00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:58.430
presentations to, you know, in
fact, you know, you go

557
00:32:58.430 --> 00:33:00.590
to their homepage, there's a
service category and you just

558
00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:02.960
find a ton of stuff
that they'll do for you

559
00:33:03.530 --> 00:33:07.370
from, you know, buying sporting
tickets to just basically helping

560
00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:10.690
you manage your life. It's
funny, all the commercials for

561
00:33:10.690 --> 00:33:12.550
these always make it seem
like the only thing that

562
00:33:12.550 --> 00:33:14.860
people who would buy and
pay for an assistant would

563
00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:17.560
do, would be like buying
tickets to the opera or

564
00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:20.780
something like that. You know,
like, you know, I don't

565
00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:23.140
feel like going to Ticketmaster.
I'll have, I'll have someone

566
00:33:23.150 --> 00:33:26.950
do that. Well, you know,
I don't want people to

567
00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:29.830
know that I'm buying tickets
for the Justin Bieber concert

568
00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:34.990
and easiest way to do
it. There's nothing. There's nothing

569
00:33:34.990 --> 00:33:38.800
wrong with that. Yes, exactly.
It is. It is my

570
00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:43.780
lifestyle choice. I think Justin,
Bieber's a perfect place to

571
00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:46.930
end our random show and
we'll see how many listeners

572
00:33:46.930 --> 00:33:51.130
we lost this this week.
Okay, perfect. That's very cool.

573
00:33:51.130 --> 00:33:53.560
Thanks so much. Dan Fernandez
for chatting with me on

574
00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:56.920
a Hansel minutia this week
on Hansel minutes.
