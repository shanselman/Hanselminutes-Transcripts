From hanselminutes.com. It's Hanselman a
weekly discussion with web developer

2
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.630
and technologist Scott Hanselman. This
is Lawrence Ryan announcing show number

3
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.270
two 98. Recorded live Thursday,
December 15, 2011. Support for

4
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.350
Hanselman is provided by Telerik
rad controls, the most comprehensive

5
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:35.100
suite of components for windows
forms and asp.net web applications

6
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:43.020
online@wwwdottelerik.com. In this episode of
the framework series, Scott talks

7
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.400
with Todd Angland from teller
about the Kendo UI HTML

8
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.850
five framework. Hi, this is
Scott Hanselman. This is another

9
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.630
episode of Hansel minutes, and
we're continuing the framework series

10
00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.230
this week. Coincidentally, we've got
Tellerik on. We're going to

11
00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.590
be talking about Kendo UI.
We've got Todd Angland from

12
00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.350
telework. Of course, if you've
listened to the show before

13
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.040
full disclosure Tellerik is a
sponsor of the show amongst

14
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.190
other sponsors, but we're having
Tellerik on because Todd and

15
00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.610
I bumped into each other.
In fact, in Sofia Bulgaria

16
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.350
at a conference we were
speaking at, and it seemed

17
00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.440
like a good idea, given
my interest in HTML five,

18
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.630
as well as the framework
series that we have a

19
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.110
chat. So FYI, they are
a sponsor, but this is

20
00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.730
a unrelated podcast topic. Todd,
thanks for chatting with me

21
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.280
today. It's a pleasure to
be on. It's really fun

22
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.130
to talk about something fun,
like HTML five and frameworks

23
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.420
today. Yeah, definitely. It's a,
it's interesting because we're seeing

24
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.670
some pretty cool frameworks coming
out from all over the

25
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.470
place from maybe unlikely locations.
People are really embracing HTML

26
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.700
five in a quicker than
I think I've ever seen

27
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.570
anything. Get, get embraced. I'm
looking at your website here.

28
00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.650
It's Kendo, K E N
D O U I. And

29
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.270
this is an HTML five
framework that you've got mobile.

30
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.570
You've got tablets. You've got
all the latest standards. Explain

31
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.890
to me what this is.
Sure. And obviously mean like

32
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.750
you said, it's not really
commercial, but just so people

33
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.450
are aware of what we're
doing really represents is looking

34
00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.260
at the emerging popularity that
we're both really excited about

35
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.500
around HTML and JavaScript and
the other things that go

36
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.650
with that and recognizing that
today, if a developer is

37
00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.050
setting out to build a
professional project, something that kind

38
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.890
of represents that traditional business
app or a bigger project,

39
00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.710
a bigger scope, it usually
means that you start out

40
00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.680
by looking for a bunch
of little libraries and pulling

41
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.420
them all together to build
your own framework. You may

42
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.900
go find backbone and knock
out. And you're basically just

43
00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.840
cobbling together this framework before
you ever get to the

44
00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.630
process of actually working on
your project. And what we

45
00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.220
said is that, you know,
if you're starting out doing

46
00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.620
development, you really should have
a better starting point. Why

47
00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.610
can't we bring everything together?
Focus on building A framework

48
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.190
that works together that built
for performance, all these things

49
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.740
that we want. And we
build software and deliver that

50
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.170
to the HTML five and
JavaScript developer. And that's essentially

51
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.780
what Kendo UI is. It's
everything that developer needs in

52
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.120
one place so they can
build on that. They can

53
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.400
version it more easily, maintain
it more easily, learn it

54
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.070
more easily, all those good
things. And today we deliver

55
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.900
it in three parts can
be UI web, which is

56
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.690
the traditional UI stuff. People
are thinking when they think

57
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.720
web software can do a
data vis, which is HTML

58
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.230
five power charts and much
more in the future. And

59
00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.270
then can do I mobile,
which is today a preview,

60
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.220
but it's where we're going
to be doing stuff that's

61
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.730
really designed to look native
looks specific to different devices

62
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.880
like iOS or Android or
windows phone and things like

63
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.120
that in the future. So
it's a big surface area,

64
00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.800
but we think it's a
really relevant problem to solve.

65
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.750
And as you said, it's
in response directly to the

66
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.880
fact that this is a
really hot area right now

67
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.410
where a lot of software
development is being done. So

68
00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.540
let's, let's work our way
from the small stuff up

69
00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.150
to the big stuff I'm
looking at the mobile. And

70
00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.550
the first thing that I
noticed is that the controls

71
00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.940
look like the O S
that they're on. So when

72
00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.910
you hit like a can
do UI mobile page, and

73
00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.350
there's a demo, you can
go and check out on

74
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.160
the website. It looks like
there are a native iPhone

75
00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.530
buttons. The slider looks like
the iPhone, but then I

76
00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.110
hit it with my Android
tablet and it actually looked

77
00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.030
like Android. And I was
expecting, it would look kind

78
00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.970
of like, I can remember
Java like 10 or 15

79
00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.650
years ago where it basically
looked like crap everywhere. Right.

80
00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.820
Has that changed yet? But
yeah, I mean, it just,

81
00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.910
the, the, the buttons look
like weird Java buttons, but

82
00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.980
of course we all want
native looking buttons on the

83
00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.710
same, you know, on, on,
I don't want to look

84
00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.960
like I've gone to a
foreign country just because I

85
00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.340
visited a mobile application on
my iPhone. Right. And actually

86
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.270
zeroed in on exactly what
it is that we're trying

87
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.650
to do a little bit
differently than some of the

88
00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.260
other things being done today
with HTML five for mobile.

89
00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.240
And that is, we know
that there are some great

90
00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.940
frameworks out there for doing
mobile development with HTML five

91
00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.860
and JavaScript. But a lot
of them either put the

92
00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.200
burden on the developers to
make the app look right

93
00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.870
on different devices, or they
kind of introduce a new,

94
00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.240
you know, non-native but mobile
friendly look and feel. We

95
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.550
recognize that there are a
lot of developers, especially businesses

96
00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.470
that they want to build
apps, and they just want

97
00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.210
to build it once or
maintain it more or less

98
00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.390
once. And generally have a
work everywhere and look right

99
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:17.670
everywhere. And that look right.
Part is so important to

100
00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:20.340
user adoption, because if it
looks like iOS, or it

101
00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.310
looks like Java from another
planet on your Android, that's

102
00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.280
not going to be well
adopted. And people are more

103
00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.860
likely to reject or not
use that app. So what

104
00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.590
can you, I, mobile does
uniquely is that it automatically

105
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.250
adapts the layout and the
presentation of your application based

106
00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.020
on the device it's running
on. And today, obviously for

107
00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.340
our, our initial focus, we're
looking at primarily iOS and

108
00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.150
Android and phones and tablets
within those spaces, but it's

109
00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.100
a vision that we'll continue
to expand on so that

110
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.320
you just worry about your
app, the content, the stuff

111
00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.840
that actually matters to your
business, and we'll handle the

112
00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.710
nuances of the different layout,
conventions and seeming that is

113
00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:59.060
native, like for the different
devices that be say as

114
00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.950
our initial vision. We certainly
think that as we get

115
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:04.190
more feedback from the community
where things that our people

116
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:05.840
are having a lot of
trouble with, we'll expand on

117
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.300
that. But it's an important
part of getting your application

118
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.160
to look right with HTML
five and JavaScript, does it

119
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.620
look right? And that's what
we're looking at here today.

120
00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.720
No, someone might look at
this though and say, I

121
00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.030
thought that HTML five on
a mobile device was a

122
00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:23.260
solved problem in that jQuery
mobile was the answer. What

123
00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.990
is it? It is, is
it what's the word? I'm

124
00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:28.030
not saying that jQuery mobile
is the only answer as

125
00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:29.860
there's, you know, there's broad
core and there's dozens of

126
00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:35.230
different other attempts at getting
a cohesive, complete web library

127
00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:39.400
of controls and, and layouts.
But is it not too

128
00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.370
late, but to, to come
out with something like this?

129
00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.640
Oh, no, definitely not. I
mean, we're talking about too

130
00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.100
late. I think we're still
at the beginning ends of

131
00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:50.440
how do we get this
right for mobile devices in

132
00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:54.340
particular? And we think jQuery
mobile jQuery UI mobile is,

133
00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.710
is good. I actually like
it a lot. And we

134
00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:57.910
think a lot of the
things that they're doing there

135
00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:00.040
are really nice, but we
have a little bit different

136
00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.990
focus and a little different
scope than what's happening with

137
00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:05.320
jQuery. Mobile jQuery. Mobile is
one of those frameworks that

138
00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.930
does use that kind of
third approach, where rather than

139
00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:11.140
trying to optimize the UI
to look native, where it

140
00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:14.290
runs it more or less
adopts a, a look and

141
00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:16.720
feel of its own, that
looks the same everywhere you

142
00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.420
run it. So where ours
looks different, where you run

143
00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:21.850
it native to the device
that looks the same everywhere

144
00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:23.800
you run it. It's just
a little bit different philosophy,

145
00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.450
but there are a lot
of philosophies in the two

146
00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:28.210
frameworks that are very similar.
The idea of doing your,

147
00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:31.690
your design, your layout through
HTML five convention. So use

148
00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:34.870
data attributes to really communicate
what various HTML on the

149
00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:37.240
page should do when it's
rendered on a mobile device.

150
00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:40.180
And there are things that
would be very familiar to

151
00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.460
a developer coming from jQuery
mobile, to working with Kendo,

152
00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:44.980
UI mobile. In that sense,
we think that there's a

153
00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:47.830
lot of good overlap, but
ultimately what we're looking to

154
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:51.700
do is again, pull all
the pieces together. So Kendall

155
00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:54.190
UI mobile will build on
the parts of Kendall, UI,

156
00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:57.310
web, and core, like the
JavaScript data source and our

157
00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:00.850
validation framework and globalization, all
the pieces come with it.

158
00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.520
So you have more than
just the UI widgets. I

159
00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:05.170
mean, UI is what you
see, but there's a lot

160
00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:07.360
more going on under the
covers that we think solve

161
00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:10.420
more of the problems involved
with building complete application, not

162
00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:13.120
just the UI of an
application, Right? Indeed. And it

163
00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:16.300
looks like you you've built
on the jQuery core. So

164
00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:20.170
you're, it, it feels like
a jQuery UI library. It

165
00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:24.220
uses the selector syntax that
we're familiar with. Right? If

166
00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:26.320
I, if I'm, if I'm
a lover of jQuery, this

167
00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:30.010
won't feel unfamiliar, Right? In
fact, we're levers of jQuery

168
00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:32.590
as well. So the only
external dependency in Kendo UI

169
00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:35.950
across the board is jQuery.
And we wanted to do

170
00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:38.290
that because we wanted the
API to be familiar. We

171
00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:40.210
liked Jacory a lot and
allows us to do some

172
00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:42.610
pretty cool things. So if
you are a fan of

173
00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:45.250
jQuery and this is kind
of what separates again, Ken

174
00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:46.840
DUI from, from the other
things that are out there,

175
00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.810
even beyond the jQuery UI
and jQuery mobiles, things that

176
00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:53.710
are built on other non
jQuery libraries by, by using

177
00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:56.100
jQuery, the Kendo UI stuff
is very familiar. You do

178
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:57.330
get a lot of these
things that you can just

179
00:08:57.540 --> 00:08:59.100
pretty much figure out how
to use if you know

180
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:02.700
how to use jQuery selectors.
So it's a very familiar

181
00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:04.980
thing for J crew developers.
And that was by, by

182
00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:08.180
intent for sure. One of
the things that kind of

183
00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:11.870
blows my mind a little
bit is how big this

184
00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:13.790
is. I mean, I saw
the, I heard about this

185
00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:15.920
and we talked about it
a couple months ago when

186
00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:17.870
we saw each other and
you were like, yeah, you

187
00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:20.090
should really check this out.
And you know, and I

188
00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:21.920
think you're, you're the same
way people see you and

189
00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.170
they go, Hey, you should
check this out, but it's

190
00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:28.760
just, there's a lot here.
Like it's big, it's like

191
00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:33.320
disturbingly, huge. You have not
five controls, but like everything

192
00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:36.980
you've got grids and, and,
and tab strips and all

193
00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:38.270
this kind of goes on
and on and on and

194
00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:41.090
on and on. Is this
a, how are you doing

195
00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:42.740
this? Are you doing this
with a whole lot of

196
00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:46.340
contributors or they're monkeys or
robots? I mean, how many

197
00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:50.180
people are doing this, this
work Advanced Bulgarian robots that

198
00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:54.290
we pound on keyboards and
through a randomness filter, we

199
00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:58.220
get the tools we want
Shine you on. But I'm

200
00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:00.770
just saying that it is
much bigger than I thought

201
00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:03.230
it would be. Sure. And
the result of that is

202
00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:06.260
really born out of just
actually a lot more work

203
00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.950
than, than it might seem.
What goes into Jake or

204
00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:13.250
into a Kendall UI in
this case is really the

205
00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:15.380
experience. We built that for
about a decade of building

206
00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:19.460
professional tools that primarily deal
with HTML and JavaScript a

207
00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:22.160
teller cause the company got
it start creating web forms,

208
00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.930
controls, which a lot of
people know teller for the

209
00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:26.990
ace.net web forms. Controls is
the end of the day

210
00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:28.640
while there is a lot
of dotnet involved there. And

211
00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:30.110
a lot of the stuff
you do to make the

212
00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:33.350
server control part of that
work, it's ultimately spitting out

213
00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:36.410
HTML and JavaScript and CSS
that has to work across

214
00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:39.560
all browsers. So we've, we
started working with the idea

215
00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:42.470
of how do you build
professional HTML and JavaScript, you

216
00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:44.720
know, a decade ago when
everybody else was just focused

217
00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:47.720
on the.net and server control
parts of this. And over

218
00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:51.230
those years, we've learned a
lot. And while we learn

219
00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:52.940
a lot of lessons, the
reality is that once you

220
00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:55.640
ship something, you can't really
go back and reboot or

221
00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:57.860
restart and do it in
a different or better way

222
00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:00.230
because you've got to support
what's out there. So we

223
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:03.590
have the Ajax controls and
then we introduced the ac.net

224
00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:07.220
MVC extensions about two or
three years ago around the

225
00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:10.280
time that NBC itself came
out. And that was one

226
00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:12.260
of our chances to kind
of reboot with all the

227
00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.780
lessons we've learned up to
that point. And we built

228
00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:17.790
the extensions natively for eight
son at NBC. Most of

229
00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:20.030
it was happening there. It
was already beginning to happen,

230
00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:23.000
client side, we were using
jQuery. Most of what the

231
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.870
NBC server extensions were doing
was outputting the necessary HTML

232
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:30.410
that would then get initialized
by our client side code.

233
00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:32.750
So when it came time
to work on Kendall UI,

234
00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:35.120
where we really were saying,
let's cut, let's cut the

235
00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.550
tie to the server. Let's
make a framework that is

236
00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:40.910
all client side, JavaScript, HTML
five, and you can bring

237
00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:43.130
whatever server framework you want
to the party. If it's

238
00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:46.430
a stunted NBC, if it's
PHP, whatever it is, you

239
00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:48.740
can use Kendo UI. We
were able to take a

240
00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:50.900
lot of that work we'd
already done for things like

241
00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:54.340
AC on net, NBC, and
then roll into a good

242
00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:56.860
starting point for what we
did with Kendo UI. And

243
00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:58.780
they're not identical. There was
obviously a lot of changes.

244
00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:00.760
We had one more chance
again, to take lessons we've

245
00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:03.850
learned and do things even
better than what we rebooted

246
00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:06.730
on on NBC. And that's
how we were able to

247
00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:09.490
start so quickly. And then
on top of that tender

248
00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:11.620
UI has been in development
for about 18 months. And

249
00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:14.200
we've got a professional team
of guys, really senior guys.

250
00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:17.290
I think it's roughly eight
or 10 engineers working on

251
00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:20.080
this. And they've had 18
months to really put together

252
00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.690
some impressive stuff. And they'll
only keep doing more of

253
00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:25.480
that as we hadn't future.
So it's just on the

254
00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:26.920
back of a lot of
hard work, no monkeys, no

255
00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:28.810
robots. And we hope to
keep doing more of it

256
00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:31.140
in the future. I see.
So that's good to know.

257
00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:35.100
So this is 18 months
of work. Cause sometimes projects

258
00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:37.230
come out and they come
out with a slick looking

259
00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:40.050
website, some cool demos. And
you kind of wonder, how

260
00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:42.000
did they bust this out
in a couple of weeks?

261
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.280
Or we know how did
this happen? This sounds like

262
00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:47.070
this has been not just
18 months, but also the,

263
00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:49.800
you know, like you said,
bringing in intellectual property and

264
00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:52.350
stuff that you were doing
on NBC. When I remember

265
00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:55.020
playing with the Telarc NBC
stuff, like I said, three

266
00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:59.880
years ago, there's a lot
of stuff underneath this. We

267
00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:01.680
learned a lot of the
important lessons about what to

268
00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.510
do and what not to
do in each of those

269
00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:06.300
iterations. And NBC was, was
a good one because it

270
00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:07.980
got us very close to
where we wanted to be

271
00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:10.500
with Kendo UI. So, you
know, one of the biggest

272
00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:12.930
things people reference, obviously when
they start working with JavaScript,

273
00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:14.940
this is a grid. I
mean, grids are kind of

274
00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:17.160
ubiquitous, maybe more so than
they should be, but they

275
00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:20.340
are what they are in
business software and do a

276
00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:22.890
grid client side with JavaScript
has all kinds of different

277
00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:25.770
problems, especially when you want
to do occasional thinking back

278
00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:27.930
to the server or you
need to do server-side data

279
00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:30.330
operations. And we were able
to learn a lot about

280
00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:32.040
the kinds of things you
need to do to do

281
00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:37.800
that effectively when there's no
kind of prescribed server page

282
00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:39.750
life cycle, like we used
to do with the h.net

283
00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:42.120
web forms days. So it
gave us a lot of

284
00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.650
the kind of headstart we
needed to be able to

285
00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:45.630
deliver a really powerful grid.
And then a lot of

286
00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:48.900
the other, I call them
simpler just because relative to

287
00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:51.540
a grid, they are things
like menus and panel bars

288
00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:53.880
and all these other kinds
of things, but there's still

289
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.230
a lot of work in
those to make sure that

290
00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:57.420
they work the way you
expect them to across all

291
00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:00.420
browsers and really all the
way back to <inaudible>. And

292
00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:02.460
that was one of the
big things we decided during

293
00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:04.470
the process of building this
were, we had to decide

294
00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:06.960
how far back do we
need to keep supporting old

295
00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:09.750
browsers and grants, some surveys.
We talked to the community

296
00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:12.510
and got some really interesting
feedback. And we ultimately decided

297
00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:15.300
after the first beta, that
<inaudible> would be kind of

298
00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:19.440
our backstop browser for, for
Kendo UI. When we first

299
00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:22.020
launched, we actually had built
in support for <inaudible>, but

300
00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:25.140
we had so much feedback
that people preferred to not

301
00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:28.950
have those kind of long
living hacks and CSS things

302
00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:31.410
be part of the framework
that we decided to kind

303
00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:34.470
of move that bar up
the <inaudible>. So it ultimately

304
00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:36.120
means that if you work
with Kendo UI, if you've

305
00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:38.400
got a latest and greatest
HTML five browser, you can

306
00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:40.320
get a little bit of
extra richness and things like

307
00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:43.080
the upload control. But if
you've got <inaudible>, you're still

308
00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:45.270
gonna get a functional experience.
That pretty much looks the

309
00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:48.330
same as any other. Yeah.
Yeah. That's a good that

310
00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:50.280
you did that. It's a
tough, I mean, it's a

311
00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:53.030
tough decision corporate people, but
at the same time, it's

312
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:55.220
the right decision. There's no
reason to be supporting a

313
00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:58.510
browser that is that old.
Yeah, it's a tough one.

314
00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:00.340
And there was mentioning feedback
from the community when we

315
00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:02.770
ran the surveys and ask
people to share their opinion.

316
00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:06.220
And we had a handful
and I'd say like, literally

317
00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:07.960
I could count them on
one hand, three or four

318
00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:11.720
people that, that really needed
ICIC support, but majority were

319
00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:14.740
really ready for Isaac support
to be cut. They were

320
00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:18.040
already on things like <inaudible>.
And we had a lot

321
00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:19.660
of people at the end
of it kind of clamoring

322
00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:21.520
to cut <inaudible> and let's
just kind of get to

323
00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:24.310
the baseline and, and work
from there. But, and we

324
00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:26.260
still recognize there's a lot
of <inaudible> out there, a

325
00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.450
lot of IEA, especially. So,
you know, we're going to

326
00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:30.400
do our best to make
sure we support as many

327
00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:33.460
of the relevant browsers that
are out there today, but

328
00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:37.390
the pace browsers are changing.
We certainly hope being advocates

329
00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:39.640
of HTML five in general,
that more and more people

330
00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:42.400
can upgrade and progress along.
The whole industry can do

331
00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:45.910
things faster without continuing to
need all this legacy support.

332
00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:50.110
Switching to the source a
little bit. I, I was

333
00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:54.760
chatting last week show with
<inaudible> who has, it was

334
00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:57.160
a guy from dev express
who has an, an open

335
00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:00.460
source project called expand that
extends some of the things

336
00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:04.870
that dev express does. So
not, not just Tellerik is

337
00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:07.240
moving into open source. Really.
Every component vendor has a

338
00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:09.790
commercial arm of the things
that they want to get

339
00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:12.910
paid for, but then they
have an open source arm.

340
00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:16.840
Kendo UI is, is open
source or it's dual license.

341
00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:19.750
What is, what is the
how's that set up? Yeah,

342
00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:22.570
let's do a license. So
kinda UI much like the

343
00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:26.140
telec extensions for H on
NBC, where before it is

344
00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:28.870
a dual licensed library, which
basically means that it's available

345
00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:32.560
under two different licenses, depending
on the, the requirements of

346
00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:35.290
your projects. So there's an
open source license, which is

347
00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:38.590
GPL V3. And then there's
the commercial license, which is

348
00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:41.290
the more traditional you pay
us money, you get support,

349
00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:43.330
you get hot six updates
and you get the things

350
00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:45.370
that basically put food on
our table at the end

351
00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:46.630
of the day. So we
can keep coming to work

352
00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:49.870
in, in building these tools.
And the, the decision ultimately

353
00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:51.970
comes down to what is
the compatibility of your project?

354
00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:54.760
If your project is GPL
compatible, then there's an open

355
00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:57.520
source license there. And we
really were introduced the open

356
00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:00.490
source license, especially when working
with HTML and JavaScript, because

357
00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:03.550
there's so much cool stuff
happening in the open source

358
00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:08.020
space or this field through
the kind of pragmatic idealism

359
00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:10.300
that has been espoused around
the GPL. You know, we

360
00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:13.030
want to support people that
are involved in open source,

361
00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:16.300
but if you're involved in
commercial projects, obviously we are

362
00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:18.220
involved in commercial software as
well. So we want to

363
00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:20.110
make sure we can pay
the bills naturally why we

364
00:17:20.110 --> 00:17:22.420
have to dual licensing. We
really love being done in

365
00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:23.920
the open space. We want
to support it. We wanna

366
00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:25.900
put the code out there,
but we also want to

367
00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:28.480
make sure that we can
all work together continuing to

368
00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.430
be professional developers just means
we get paid for our

369
00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:34.750
development into the future. Why
GPL and not something more,

370
00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:38.350
you know, MIT or be,
you know, BST or patchy,

371
00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:41.470
something a little lighter, a
little less frightening to commercial

372
00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:45.790
vendors. Sure. Yeah. I think
there's no question that, you

373
00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:47.440
know, you could probably do
and you probably have done

374
00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:50.820
many shows over the differences
in the open source licenses

375
00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:52.680
and the chaos that comes
from trying to sort through

376
00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:55.710
all that. And we spent
a lot of time internally,

377
00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:58.140
probably months trying to really
determine what is the best

378
00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:01.110
way to do a dual
licensed product like this. And

379
00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:04.410
we talk about things like
MIT and BSD and the

380
00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:08.340
copy free licenses as they're
often called and obviously GPL.

381
00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:09.990
One of its hallmarks is
that it's a copy of

382
00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:12.450
left license as opposed to
copy free, which is what

383
00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:14.760
tends to introduce a lot
of the fear of people

384
00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:17.430
that don't fully understand it.
And the reason we went

385
00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:20.580
that route is because PPL
in this case really embraces

386
00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:23.700
what our intent is with
having an open source license

387
00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:26.820
copy free is, is okay
for some projects where the

388
00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:28.830
main intent is primarily to
put it out there and

389
00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:30.750
then just kind of turn
it loose and let the

390
00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:33.360
world do what they want
to do with it. And

391
00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:36.630
our intent is more about
supporting open source projects with

392
00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:39.960
the products that we've created.
So, you know, we want

393
00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:42.750
to support open source projects
that are trying to create

394
00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:46.320
other new open source things
that are in benefiting software

395
00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:49.380
developers in general, benefiting the
world in general, but it's

396
00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:51.690
not really our intent to
put our effort out there

397
00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:54.240
and then compete against it
if you understand in that

398
00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:58.440
regard. So we felt GPL
best married what our objective

399
00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:00.420
was with the open source
licenses that are out there

400
00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:04.230
that are well-defined that corporations
do have an understanding. We

401
00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:06.570
don't want to go create
some new license. And so

402
00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:09.900
it just ended up that
GPL B3 was most compatible

403
00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:13.200
with our goals for open
source and the other licenses

404
00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:15.330
are great and they're good
for different things. It just

405
00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:17.540
didn't make sense for our
pro Yeah, that's, that's an

406
00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:20.780
interesting thing. I'm, I'm, I'm
not typically a fan of

407
00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:23.780
GPL, but at the same
time, your point is that

408
00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:28.730
GPL is in a truly
open source by using the

409
00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:33.770
kind of the Stallman term
open source project. That's that's

410
00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:36.590
supportive of GPL then Hey,
great. Use the product, no

411
00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:40.580
problem, but if you want,
but it's scary enough that

412
00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:43.550
it encourages commercial commercial use
at the same time, in

413
00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:47.690
the sense of like by
a reasonably priced commercial, you

414
00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:49.880
a commercial license, and you
don't have to worry about

415
00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:52.280
it. And if you really,
really want to go all

416
00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:55.640
open source, that's available too.
If it was something like

417
00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:59.540
a patchy or MSPL, then
there's no reason for someone

418
00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:02.300
to pay, Right. You know,
in certain companies are set

419
00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:04.070
up in different ways. And
I've tried to share this

420
00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:06.590
with others in the past,
you know, a company that,

421
00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:09.020
that creates something that, you
know, has professional teams, the

422
00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:10.940
people involved in creating a
product and then makes it

423
00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:13.790
available under something like MIT
or one of the copy

424
00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:17.000
free licenses. It's traditionally more
set up to make their

425
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.320
money on doing things like
consulting or training services. They're,

426
00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:23.870
they're really ultimately developers that
are in business being professional

427
00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:27.620
trainers or profess professional consultants.
And tell our cause is

428
00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:29.900
just as a company configured
to be a professional software

429
00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:33.440
developer, we are good at
creating and supporting software. And

430
00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:35.660
so to remain being good
at that, that's kind of

431
00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:39.290
what our whole, our whole
processes is built around. And

432
00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:43.640
so we have the, we
don't primarily operate off selling

433
00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:46.640
support or selling consulting. So
we, we sell our tools

434
00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:49.060
and in that regard, that's
where GPL and the commercial

435
00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:52.000
license most aligned with. Not
only just how we want

436
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.560
to put the software out
there, but also just how

437
00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:56.290
we're structured to operate, not
to be completely Frank. I'd

438
00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:57.880
love if can, can do
you, I could be an

439
00:20:57.910 --> 00:21:01.060
every project out there and
I really would, but at

440
00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:02.470
the end of the day,
the reality is it is

441
00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:05.530
not the most compatible with
copy free projects. You know,

442
00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:08.860
if you're doing MIT copy
free project. Well, I love

443
00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:11.290
that. And I really admire
those kind of work being

444
00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:13.900
done there, but unfortunately just
doesn't really marry well with

445
00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:17.340
the licensing we have with
Kendo UI. Right. Right. And

446
00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:21.080
sometimes Microsoft gets criticized for
doing what N w what

447
00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:24.120
people say is not open
source, but rather source opened.

448
00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:27.450
We'll, we'll say that, Hey,
look, this is open source,

449
00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:30.120
but it really it's that
the source is available and

450
00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:32.400
you can fork it, but
we won't take take backs.

451
00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:35.100
And that seemed to be
kind of an ongoing issue

452
00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:37.530
with commercial companies. Do you,
do you have any intent

453
00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:40.020
to do, to do takebacks
at this point? Or is

454
00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:42.570
that still something that's being
worked on? Yeah, it is

455
00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:44.760
really a work in progress,
and it's not something that

456
00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:48.270
we're actively against by any
stretch. Anytime you start dealing

457
00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:50.310
with any of this stuff,
I'm sure it's only magnified

458
00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:53.820
when you talk about a
company like Microsoft, the lawyers

459
00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:55.710
get involved, right. And that's
the big question of, you

460
00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:58.380
know, when you take these
contributions and then you've got

461
00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:01.110
the liability attached to Microsoft
who has money to be

462
00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:04.320
sued. If something comes up,
you know, that's where the

463
00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:06.240
things get hairy. But for
us, we would like to

464
00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:08.640
enable people to contribute. And
we've talked about different ways

465
00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:11.340
to do that. We haven't
established a way to do

466
00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:13.410
it here at the initial
launch. And part of that

467
00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:15.240
was just from some of
the experience we had with

468
00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:19.890
our last open source offering
with, with MVC, we put

469
00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:23.130
the teller extensions face done
at NBC out under a

470
00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:26.130
dual license as well. And
we first launched that we

471
00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:28.650
did work with the community
to kind of embrace the

472
00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:31.860
idea of accepting contributions and,
you know, kind of feel

473
00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:33.870
out what the interest was
there. And, and there just

474
00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:36.930
was very little, and, you
know, you could associate that

475
00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:39.150
with the GPL license and,
you know, not being MIT

476
00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:41.400
and other things. But I
think the reality is even

477
00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:43.800
when you look at big
projects, the number of people

478
00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:45.960
that actually contribute to those
projects tend to be a

479
00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:49.560
pretty small core group of
passionate people. And when you

480
00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:52.380
have a product that's being
evolved by a professional team,

481
00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:54.360
you know, often there's a
little bit less need for

482
00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:56.430
somebody in the community to
get really passionate about it

483
00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:59.670
because the product team is
full time focusing on improving

484
00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:02.280
that product. And in the
case, something that came to

485
00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:05.070
UI, they're very likely going
to ship the improvements that

486
00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:07.170
you want in the next
release, which for us three

487
00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:09.510
releases per year know, four
months, and you're going to

488
00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:12.300
have those features in the
product. So, you know, I

489
00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:15.900
think there's a set of
circumstances that come together around

490
00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:18.240
the software we ship, we
update it very frequently. We've

491
00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:20.880
got professional people looking at
it all the time. And

492
00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:23.460
that tends to, I think,
discourage people from getting really

493
00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:26.610
passionate about creating those contributions,
but to your core question,

494
00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:29.220
yeah. We'd like to enable
it to the GPL version

495
00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:30.780
of Kendo UI. And I
think we're going to be

496
00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:32.400
continuing to look at that.
And if we can create

497
00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:34.800
a process, if we can
find the interests, we absolutely

498
00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:37.260
do want to enable people
to get involved with Kendra

499
00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:40.470
UI as much as they
want to. Now it's split

500
00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:43.920
up into three pieces here.
There's web data, visualization and

501
00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:46.520
mobile. And while mobile is
the one that's kind of

502
00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:49.280
a exciting and sexy. And
I must say that, I

503
00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:51.380
think that the mobile demo
is pretty amazing because it's

504
00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:53.360
got this, it's cool. You're
looking at it under your

505
00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:56.150
desktop. And then this hand
comes up, this like perfectly

506
00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:59.150
photographed hand holding the device
you want, and then you

507
00:23:59.150 --> 00:24:01.970
pick the mobile device and
it comes up with a

508
00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:03.980
new mobile device. It's a
pretty cool demo. You should

509
00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:06.560
check it out, but you've
got the mobile stuff. But

510
00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:10.580
also web and data is
when I did the data

511
00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:13.700
vis or data visualization when
I kept right. Clicking on

512
00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:16.100
the charts. Cause I didn't,
I thought they were flash,

513
00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:20.410
Right? Yeah. Those are some,
some cool things. And I

514
00:24:20.410 --> 00:24:23.650
think David today is sort
of a, a footprint of

515
00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:26.530
where we want to go.
It certainly doesn't represent where

516
00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:29.710
we, we think the end
goal is it's today. It's

517
00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:32.500
primarily some, some chart types
built on each email, five

518
00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:35.590
things like pie charts and
bar charts, but I've already

519
00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:37.210
started to introduce them. The
rich things you can do

520
00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:40.360
with HTML five, like animations
that when the chart loads,

521
00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:42.760
it's not just a static
image, which could be mistaken

522
00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:45.160
for an image it's very
clearly dynamic and a gate

523
00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:47.680
engaging. It's something your users
can, can look at and,

524
00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:50.560
and really digest the data
in interesting ways. And so

525
00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:53.410
it's all show five. It
is no, there are no

526
00:24:53.410 --> 00:24:55.900
plugins involved here. In fact,
under the covers, we're using

527
00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:58.660
SVG and VML so that
we can deliver a very

528
00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:02.200
broad browser support. And, you
know, the, the reason we

529
00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:03.880
went that route of course
is because we want it

530
00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:06.250
to work everywhere. And that's
really part of the, the

531
00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:08.800
idea of HTML five is
I can create this software

532
00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:11.380
with data visualization and will
work just as well on

533
00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:14.380
my desktop browser, as it
does on my iPad, where

534
00:25:14.410 --> 00:25:17.920
clearly there are no plugins
allowed and that extends to

535
00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:21.310
Android and other things obviously
in the future. So this

536
00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:24.400
is the idea with database,
for Kendo. UI is delivering

537
00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:26.830
that same kind of richness
you do traditionally associate with

538
00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:29.650
plugins, but delivering it in
a way that can be

539
00:25:29.650 --> 00:25:33.910
used on tablets, devices, desktops
like, Yeah, I think that

540
00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:38.020
this is a good opportunity
looking at frameworks. Like this

541
00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:41.260
is a good opportunity for
people who maybe have been

542
00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:43.930
thinking about HTML five, but
haven't actually gotten around to

543
00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:47.560
doing it, to really understand
what's possible. I mean, even

544
00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:50.940
myself and I'm, I feel
like I'm pretty steeped in,

545
00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:54.730
in HTML five lately. We've
been just, we eat, sleep,

546
00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:59.590
drink it. You know, I'm
still consistently impressed with the

547
00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:02.110
stuff. And I'm always, I
mean, I can even tell

548
00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:05.260
you guys at Microsoft are
always, you know, right-click is

549
00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:07.780
that, Oh, Oh, they, Oh,
wow. They did do that.

550
00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:10.750
You know what I mean?
That's a, it's funny. I

551
00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:13.510
was talking to Chris cells.
I think you actually just

552
00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:17.860
hired Chris cells recently to
come work at. I tell

553
00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:19.930
her how I was talking
to him last night. And

554
00:26:19.930 --> 00:26:22.720
he said, you know, HTML
five is a computer. It

555
00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:27.490
confusing and complex mess, but
it's an extremely capable, confusing,

556
00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:29.920
and complex mess. And I
think that was, Chris's very

557
00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:34.000
wise way of saying definitely
don't count HTML five out.

558
00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:37.720
You can do some crazy
stuff with it. Yeah, No,

559
00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:39.730
you opened up when we
talked today about, you know,

560
00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:43.510
how, how unusually fast HDL
five is being adopted and

561
00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:46.290
how fast it's evolving. And
whenever I talk to you

562
00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:48.480
about that and you know,
why is that happening? You

563
00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:50.310
know, I just list the
name of companies that are

564
00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:53.100
more or less behind and
endorsing and embracing the HTML

565
00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:58.740
five, but Apple, Google, Microsoft,
Adobe. I'm probably leaving somebody

566
00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:00.870
out here. Amazon is another
one. I mean, these are

567
00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:04.380
tech vendors, major tech vendors
that you don't usually list

568
00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:06.270
as being on the same
page. They're usually in some

569
00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:09.210
way or another working against
each other. And here you've

570
00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:12.900
got them all essentially working
in agreement, not necessarily explicitly,

571
00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:17.400
but certainly implicitly around the
same. As you said, UI

572
00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:21.570
layer, HTML five and CSS.
And that's pretty remarkable. So,

573
00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:24.780
you know, whether the improvements
come from, from Microsoft or

574
00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:27.120
they come from Google or
whoever, there's a huge amount

575
00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:30.030
of investment from very big
players in this space around

576
00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:32.880
the same core technologies, which
I think is what is

577
00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:36.690
helping really accelerate that evolution
of the tooling, certainly of

578
00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:39.750
the browsers, the runtimes as
they are. And that's why

579
00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:41.880
it's exciting to be part
of it. It's definitely in

580
00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:44.040
its early days and there's
more and more people get

581
00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:45.810
focused on it. I think
the whole space is gonna

582
00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:50.570
become a lot richer. Definitely,
definitely. Interestingly, I was looking

583
00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:54.830
at, where do I see?
Where do I get the

584
00:27:54.830 --> 00:28:00.200
code? Yeah. So for Kennedy
UI, I have to do,

585
00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:01.490
I have to make an
account to get that, or

586
00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:03.410
is this hosted like a
GitHub or somewhere I can

587
00:28:03.410 --> 00:28:06.020
find the source I had
to download the source today.

588
00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:07.700
You just have to log
in to Ken DUI website.

589
00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:09.590
And we've got a simple
package there that includes all

590
00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:12.200
the examples, all the source
code and everything. And, you

591
00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:14.840
know, that's, that was another
process we went through early

592
00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:16.520
on. You know, what, where
and how did you get

593
00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:20.090
these things? We actually do
develop the Alexander UI on

594
00:28:20.090 --> 00:28:23.870
GitHub. So our dev team
actually uses get hub itself

595
00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:26.600
for all of its work
on the Kendo UI product.

596
00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:29.570
But there are just certain
complexities we're still working through

597
00:28:29.570 --> 00:28:32.180
to how do we expose
that more directly, but for

598
00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:34.040
today, if you want the
source simply log in Kendo,

599
00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:36.880
ui.com. If you don't have
an account, click needs you

600
00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:39.050
to create one and you
can download the whole source.

601
00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:41.540
And I know some people
get frustrated with the registration

602
00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:43.670
and log in to download
things, but you know, to,

603
00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:45.280
to us, to the people
we want to talk to

604
00:28:45.290 --> 00:28:48.470
professional software developers, you know,
all we're asking is please

605
00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:50.990
trade, letting us know who
you are with letting us

606
00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:53.000
give you everything we've ever
done. And we think it's

607
00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.910
a pretty simple and fair
trade. And if you can

608
00:28:55.910 --> 00:28:58.280
do that, then we hope
we can help you be

609
00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:00.380
more productive as you develop
software. I assume you're not

610
00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:02.240
going to spam them. You
just want to understand what

611
00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:04.490
they need and stuff like
that. Right? Right. Absolutely. I

612
00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:06.740
mean, we're developers do, we're
not in the business of

613
00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:09.140
spamming. We just want to
make sure that, you know,

614
00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:11.780
we're talking to professional people
and I think professional people

615
00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:15.350
generally understand that the fair
trade in that information for

616
00:29:15.410 --> 00:29:18.020
software tools. So at the
end of the day, we're

617
00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:19.820
trying to make the best
tools we can and make

618
00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:23.270
the best stuff out there
for HTML, JavaScript developers. And

619
00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:25.070
to do that, we just
need to understand, you know,

620
00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:26.960
who's using it, how many
people are using it, all

621
00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:29.120
these various things. And by
having people log in to

622
00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:31.490
download, we're able to understand,
okay, there is this absolute

623
00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:33.890
number of people working with
it, as opposed to there's

624
00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:36.590
this one guy who's downloaded
it 10,000 times in his

625
00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:40.070
basement and that skews, excuse
some of the numbers. One

626
00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:42.340
of the things that we're
always thinking at Microsoft and

627
00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:44.500
the web platform team that
I work on, and I

628
00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:47.290
was actually up in Seattle
yesterday, thinking about this was

629
00:29:47.290 --> 00:29:52.810
that, what does a, I
can do UI or a

630
00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:58.600
third party commercial vendor library
that's built entirely on JavaScript

631
00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:02.650
look like in a, in
an asp.net world or in

632
00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:05.740
a, you know, whatever your
web framework of choices like

633
00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:09.460
have widgets moved completely from
the surface side to the

634
00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:11.410
client side. And that's the
way, the way that things

635
00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:14.440
are going to be would,
would someone ever want to

636
00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:18.400
still have a visual designer
and drag data grids and

637
00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:21.700
calendars around except rather than
making surface side code, they

638
00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:25.330
would create, for example, Kendall
UI web stuff. I mean,

639
00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:29.140
as you guys dip, dip
your toes into this client

640
00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:34.450
side world, while you are
traditionally a big component vendor,

641
00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:36.220
do you think about those
same kinds of issues and

642
00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:37.870
you have any thoughts about
where you're going to go

643
00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:40.080
with it? Yeah. I mean,
there's a lot of platform

644
00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:43.920
guidance that, that, especially in
the Microsoft space developers really

645
00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:46.260
need to understand because when
you're developing in the Microsoft

646
00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:48.240
stack in particular, there are
a lot of different options.

647
00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:51.600
Whether you're talking MVC and
web forms is different varieties

648
00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:54.900
based on net or Silverlight
WPS if you're moving to

649
00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:56.970
XAML. And I think if
you were to look at

650
00:30:56.970 --> 00:30:59.940
web development in general, the
trend has been over the

651
00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:03.900
last several years towards increasingly
client side processing. And that's

652
00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:06.390
not only what we saw
through the increasing adoption of

653
00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:09.630
JavaScript to do more and
more of an applications front

654
00:31:09.630 --> 00:31:12.720
end processing. But we also
saw that with Silverlight whatever

655
00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:15.900
else it may be. Silverlight
a shift to putting more

656
00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:19.440
of the execution of.net code
and processing onto the client

657
00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:21.960
and having this kind of
lightweight communication layer back to

658
00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:24.300
the server for persistence and
workflow and those kinds of

659
00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:27.540
things. So I think that
the trend is absolutely towards

660
00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:32.460
moving things into the client
because clients are powerful. Clients

661
00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:34.110
can do more. The more
you can do in the

662
00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:37.320
client, the less roundtrip latency
you introduce into applications, which

663
00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:40.080
with the explosion of mobile
and mobile bandwidth, that's a

664
00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:42.480
big problem. Again, you know,
if you have something as

665
00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:45.660
simple as validation and you
require, require a server round

666
00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:49.800
trip to really apply that
validation consistently that's standard, it's

667
00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:52.380
a huge amount of lag
in roundtrip time into your

668
00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:56.130
mobile app and probably destroy
the experience. So from simple

669
00:31:56.130 --> 00:31:58.110
things like that to more
complex things that we can

670
00:31:58.110 --> 00:32:01.410
now do with JavaScript in
the UI, it's all about

671
00:32:01.410 --> 00:32:04.440
just improving the end user
experience. And I think it's

672
00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:06.450
a trend that will continue.
So if you're a server

673
00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:10.950
developer, if you're working@hp.net web
forms, let's say, I don't

674
00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:13.440
think that this is something
you have to view as

675
00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:15.150
a threat. And I think
that's the one nice thing

676
00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:18.450
about HTML five in general,
it's all backwards compatible. You

677
00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:20.400
can easily use it side
by side with anything you're

678
00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:23.130
doing today with HTML. And
we tossed around the formational

679
00:32:23.130 --> 00:32:26.460
five very freely, but clearly
it's just HTML four plus

680
00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:29.250
new stuff, and you can
easily use it side by

681
00:32:29.250 --> 00:32:32.460
side. And a lot of
the server control vendors tell

682
00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:35.130
her as well as clearly
being part of this group

683
00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:38.640
are already baking in HTML
five in different ways into

684
00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:41.390
our server controls. So if
you use the teller extensions,

685
00:32:41.390 --> 00:32:44.180
racy on net, NBC, and
you don't like HTML and

686
00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:48.200
JavaScript, you're very likely already
using DCSS three and HTML

687
00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:51.410
five that we're rendering for
you, same for web forms

688
00:32:51.410 --> 00:32:54.110
and Ajax. So some of
this will just start to

689
00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:57.560
transparently happen for the server
developer. They'll use their abstractions,

690
00:32:57.620 --> 00:33:00.650
they'll use server controls, and
those abstractions will render the

691
00:33:00.650 --> 00:33:04.670
metal technologies, HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript. And they'll sort of

692
00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:07.370
rise with the tide. Their
controls will take them into

693
00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:09.620
the future, or they can
start mixing some of this

694
00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:11.660
stuff side by side. If
they have some really complex

695
00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:14.090
workflows that are server driven
and it would just be

696
00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:16.970
too hard to refactor into
client code. Those can continue

697
00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:19.280
to be server driven, but
maybe they have some simpler

698
00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:21.680
scenarios in their applications, which
could cut out some of

699
00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:24.470
that server round tripping some
of that page post backing,

700
00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:26.690
and they could do it
with simple web services and

701
00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:29.540
client side UI, something like
Kendo UI allows you to

702
00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:32.570
come in, introduce that client
side UI that can render

703
00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:34.850
an update on the client
and give you the power.

704
00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:37.430
You need to have that
without all the traditional post

705
00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:40.340
backs that you require with
server controls. So I think

706
00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:43.670
the model that is the
future in many ways, but

707
00:33:43.670 --> 00:33:47.090
is not a threat to
people that are comfortable and

708
00:33:47.090 --> 00:33:50.030
familiar with server side development.
It's easy to add on

709
00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:54.730
and it's easy to use
in a compatible way. Very

710
00:33:54.730 --> 00:33:57.430
cool. Well, people can check
this out at Tendo, K

711
00:33:57.460 --> 00:33:59.770
E N D O U
i.com. I'll put links up

712
00:33:59.770 --> 00:34:02.320
on the show notes and
Todd, I really appreciate you

713
00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:05.470
coming on and talking to
us about this framework. It's

714
00:34:05.470 --> 00:34:06.820
fun. And I hope people
do check it out. And

715
00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:09.310
certainly, you know, we're not
an Island, but people check

716
00:34:09.310 --> 00:34:10.720
it out and the things
they like, things they hate,

717
00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:12.520
they can always email me
and I'm free to give

718
00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:15.520
out my email address, teller.com.
And I'd love to hear

719
00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:20.500
the feedback and we're here
to Very cool. This has

720
00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:23.170
been another episode of Hansel
minutes, and we'll see you

721
00:34:23.170 --> 00:34:24.040
again next week.
