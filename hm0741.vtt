G U n.com. Hi, this

11
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.690
is Scott Hanselman. This is
another episode of Hansel minutes

12
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.400
today. I'm talking with dr.
Alex Constantine. She's a director

13
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.410
of data science at tandem
diabetes care and a fellow

14
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.670
type one diabetic. How are
you? Hi, I'm very well.

15
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.130
Thank you. How are you?
I'm getting there. I feel

16
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:06.320
like between us, we've got
like 50 plus years at

17
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.410
diabetes experience here. This is
pretty cool. Although I'm been

18
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.300
living it, you've been living
it, but then you also

19
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.820
have a background in data
science. So you get to

20
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.740
manage your own disease with
an expertise under that understands

21
00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.010
the data that you're, that
you're creating. Yeah, I, I

22
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.030
think some of the, my
diabetes knowledge definitely started personal

23
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.520
and with a lot of
training, like most people, but

24
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.370
now I combine what I
find in the data with

25
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.230
those hypothesis that they've developed
from personal experience and to

26
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.390
just look at what, what
the data tells us Now,

27
00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.360
when I became a type
one diabetic in the nineties,

28
00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.700
I would prick my finger
and I would wait about

29
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.960
a minute until a little
piece of gauze turned blue

30
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.540
and then a little light
sensor would look at the

31
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.240
color of blue and then
the darker, the blue, the

32
00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.280
more sugar I had in
my blood. And it was,

33
00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.550
and that was pretty fancy
for the nineties. And then

34
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.980
I would write that into
an Excel sheet or on

35
00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.350
a piece of paper. And
I would log that. I

36
00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.180
think I would check my
blood sugar, maybe five or

37
00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.640
10 times a day. And
everyone thought that I was

38
00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.730
checking so much. Why would
you check your blood sugar

39
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.260
so much? How did you
start out? Well, so I

40
00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.170
was diagnosed when I was
seven and they grew up

41
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.300
in Romania. So it's still
early nineties, but that technology

42
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.930
hadn't quite all gotten through
Romania at that point. So

43
00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.890
I was admitted to the
hospital when I was diagnosed

44
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.290
and they spent about a
month there to get my

45
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.450
insulin dosing quite right. And
at that time, no one

46
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.980
was using pest strips as
the common way of testing

47
00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.780
blood sugar. So I was
getting blood drawn intravenously to

48
00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.870
test how my blood sugar
was before and after meals

49
00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:00.070
and really adjust those doses.
So it was very driven.

50
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.890
It all had to happen
in the hospital. And then

51
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.560
a few, a few years
in, we got test strips

52
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.540
and were able to use
those at home. And that

53
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.640
really changed things. That's a
really good point. And even

54
00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.200
now in 2020, a lot
of the technology still isn't

55
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.850
accessible to people for geographical
reasons, whether it be a

56
00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.550
far flung places, far away
from where the labs are,

57
00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.730
or whether it be cost
or medical, depending on the

58
00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.210
medical industry within that country,
there are things that I

59
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:33.150
can do and you can
do now here that may

60
00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.870
not be available back home,
Right? We have all the

61
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.110
best technology right now is
systems that are able to

62
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.700
adjust insulin doses in real
time based on continuous glucose

63
00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.630
monitoring, but that's not really
readily accessible to a lot

64
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.740
of people. And that's something
that hopefully will, will change

65
00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.760
over time. And more people
will benefit from this technology.

66
00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:01.500
Indeed. There's definitely people still
who are doing what they

67
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.560
call MDI, right? Multiple daily
injections. They prick their fingers

68
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.160
and they take injections the
same way that I did

69
00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.590
30 plus years ago. So
it would be nice to

70
00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.690
make those things available to
them. But the one thing

71
00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.940
that they all have in
common and they always have

72
00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.380
had in common is they're
producing data. That feels like

73
00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.410
it's a thing about diabetes.
That's quite unique. We create

74
00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.230
a lot of data about
our bodies and always have,

75
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.090
Right. The diabetes is certainly
one of the most data

76
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.800
driven conditions that I know
about between the continuous glucose

77
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.020
monitoring, which is both at
use as outcomes, but also

78
00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.200
as inputs to all the
decisions you're making and all

79
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.170
of the factors that can
affect blood glucose levels. There's

80
00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.860
really a lot of data
that you could have. And

81
00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.010
a lot of data that
is hidden in the background

82
00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.380
affects blood glucose levels, but
we can't quite measure or

83
00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.940
really do do data science
about. Yeah. One of the

84
00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.930
things that I've always found
frustrating about diabetes is it

85
00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.330
will, you can tell me
what my blood sugar is

86
00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.750
this moment, but I don't
know if I'm doing a

87
00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.010
good job until 20 years
from now when I don't

88
00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:17.130
go blind or when I
don't have a cardiac issue

89
00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.590
or I don't lose my,
my kidneys. So there's all

90
00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.050
this data and producing every
day, all the time for

91
00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.840
the last 20 or 30
years. But by the time

92
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.210
I find out if it
worked or not, it's too

93
00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:32.190
late. Yeah. Well, there are
some outcomes that are immediate

94
00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:34.890
than some that are longer
term. I think they'd be,

95
00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:39.510
these is a balancing act.
You, you want to provide

96
00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:43.230
insulin because your body is
no longer producing it, but

97
00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:47.820
getting the dose just right
is very difficult. And if

98
00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:51.210
you give too much, then
you have hypoglycemia, which can

99
00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:55.170
have it maybe had consequences.
So you might feel a

100
00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:59.000
little bit shaky or sweaty
if it's really extreme and

101
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.080
it's not treated, you could
have seizures or lose consciousness

102
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.600
and up in the hospital
or, or even die. So

103
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.660
that that's very acute then
preventing that is a big

104
00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:12.680
focus. Would that be these
management, but then if you

105
00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:17.510
don't give enough insulin, and
if you have chronic hyperglycemia,

106
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:20.930
then you're at risk of
these microvascular complications, which will

107
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:25.220
show up years later, like
you said, so it's, it's

108
00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:29.480
all, it's a control engineering
problem. You're trying to keep

109
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:32.870
things in this very tight,
narrow range and account for

110
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:35.930
all the factors that might,
might influence glucose levels and

111
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:41.690
also predict them. And unlike
other control engineering problems, humans

112
00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:46.460
have been the ones who
were, who were manually solving

113
00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:51.350
the control problems. And now
with the introduction of automated

114
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:55.130
insulin delivery systems, that's changing
a little bit, but there's

115
00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:57.920
still a lot that people
have to actually do. They

116
00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:02.140
have to be the control
engineers, whether I'm an amateur

117
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:06.220
expert, That is a really
good point. So there's two

118
00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:09.130
things that I want to
parse out. First, you point

119
00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:14.200
out that the, the, the
quick urgency of diabetes I

120
00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.750
eat, I just had a
sandwich. I ate lunch actually

121
00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:19.810
two hours ago. I'm thinking
about even, well, we are

122
00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:23.350
having this conversation about what
my blood sugar is now,

123
00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:27.070
right now, I'm at one
70, which is high, but

124
00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:30.250
it's an hour after eating.
So hopefully it'll be back

125
00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:33.430
down to a hundred within
an hour or so. And

126
00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:36.460
I'm trying to get back
down softly. Like I don't

127
00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:39.460
want to crash and have
an awful afternoon, but I

128
00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:42.880
do want to get down
quickly and comfortably so that

129
00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.770
I don't have an issue
like you talked about, but

130
00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:47.500
then there's the, well, if
I hit one 80 every

131
00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:51.280
single day at lunchtime for
20 years, what kind of

132
00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:55.540
microvascular things might I deal
with in 20 years in

133
00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:58.570
the past, as you said,
I have to look at

134
00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:00.760
the numbers and I have
to make the decision. So

135
00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:03.430
in control engineering, you have
a sensor, you have a

136
00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:06.310
detector, and you think about
your, your output performance and

137
00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:08.230
you kind of loop don't,
you, you look at the

138
00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:10.630
number and you make a
decision, but I don't know

139
00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:13.030
if everyone is good at
that. That seems like a

140
00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:15.340
very unfair thing for a
disease to make me have

141
00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:18.400
to be good at math,
Right? It takes a lot

142
00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:22.750
of math and that constant
monitoring, because most control systems

143
00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:26.170
have these time steps, that
where they look and make

144
00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:31.270
decisions. And they're every five
minutes, every 15 minutes, whatever

145
00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:34.270
they are, but it's very
frequent. So you want to

146
00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:37.840
go out and live life
and not worry about diabetes

147
00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:41.140
so much. So I'm having
to do all of that

148
00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:45.460
as a human you're obviously
going to have a much

149
00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:50.020
longer control interval, which will
make your glycaemic outcomes suffer,

150
00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:56.100
but there's always this trade
off between glycaemic outcomes, safety,

151
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.730
and use the ability or
the ability to go live

152
00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:03.710
your life. So when you
think about a control system,

153
00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:06.050
it's like cruise control on
a car, right? I mean,

154
00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:08.990
you're thinking about the speed
and you're adjusting the motor

155
00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:11.900
as you go forward and
backward. And I think that

156
00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:15.020
maybe basic self driving cars
to try to stay inside

157
00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:18.530
the lane or a kind
of a control system, but

158
00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:20.750
they really are just focused
on the moment. Right? Do

159
00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:23.780
control systems think about the
future that they think about

160
00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:25.940
days in advance or weeks
in advance, or they only

161
00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:30.680
think about the now, Well,
th there's definitely several components

162
00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:35.840
there. So you have a
prediction component and that's especially

163
00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:39.110
because of what, one of
the factors you mentioned. So

164
00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:44.270
insulin that's given exogenously is
not the same as the

165
00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:48.650
insulin, a healthy pancreas might
produce. It takes a lot

166
00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:54.230
longer for it to start
acting that, showing an effect

167
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:56.780
on blood glucose and also
a very long time to

168
00:09:56.780 --> 00:10:00.530
leave your system compared to
the glucose your pancreas might

169
00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:05.240
produce. So at the insulin.
So because of that, you

170
00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:08.840
have to predict a lot
more. If insulin was really

171
00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:13.010
fast and you could see
its action immediately, and it

172
00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:16.510
really went the way quickly,
then this would be a

173
00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:19.670
much easier problem, but because
you have to predict and

174
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:24.110
weight and measure everything that's
already in your system, and

175
00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:26.900
what will it do three,
four hours from now, there's

176
00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:31.010
definitely a big prediction component
to it. And then there's

177
00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:34.190
the adjustment when, when things
are different, from what you're

178
00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:38.090
expecting, how do you adjust
the insulin levels? And then

179
00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:43.040
there's also the, the models
and parameters underlying that. What,

180
00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:47.360
what is the effect of
insulin on blood glucose? So

181
00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:50.630
as the effect of carbohydrates
from meals on, on blood

182
00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:54.590
glucose, and those have parameters
that are very specific to

183
00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:58.220
individuals, And then that, that
word that you use, the

184
00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:01.610
people who are listening may
not be familiar with exogenous

185
00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:05.420
insulin, that's insulin, your body
doesn't make. So you're saying

186
00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:09.440
that regular people, the normals,
the normally sugared people, they

187
00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:12.740
have insulin that's coming from
the inside of their body

188
00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:17.120
while we're basically shoving insulin
in. And we're using fat

189
00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.820
on the outside of our
body to absorb that insulin,

190
00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:21.890
which is not really what
fat is for, is it

191
00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:26.750
Right? Right. So it creates
the, from reactions, from what

192
00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:31.520
you would see in, in
a presume without diabetes. So

193
00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:33.230
when you're thinking about this
in the context of data

194
00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:36.080
science, there's all these variables
to think about. There's variables

195
00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:38.450
that you've identified and you've
noticed, and you fed into

196
00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:40.670
your models, but then there's
a lot of hidden variables.

197
00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:44.240
Like right now I had
my sandwich, my blood sugar

198
00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:46.250
is going up a little
faster than I would have

199
00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:49.670
liked it to. I did
everything right though. And the

200
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:52.280
part that I find so
surprising and frustrating about diabetes.

201
00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:54.280
And I wonder if you
do as well, is it

202
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:58.750
worked yesterday? Why doesn't it
work today? How do you

203
00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:02.910
solve for hidden variables like
that? Right. Well, there there's

204
00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:07.080
a lot going on. And
Adam Brown actually published a list

205
00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:10.470
with four, the three factors
that are known so far

206
00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:13.800
that the fag blood PAB
blood glucose levels, and some

207
00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:16.410
of them are the obvious
one was we talked about

208
00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:20.950
like carbs and insulin, but
there's also stress illness, all

209
00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:24.570
these variables that we can
accurately measure, and we could

210
00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:29.640
get more sensors and more
data about exercise and other

211
00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:32.610
kinds of activities that would
be helpful, but there will

212
00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:37.080
always be these hidden and
measured components that we need

213
00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:42.630
to address and respond to,
which is why automatic insulin

214
00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:48.240
delivery systems are so important
because they take that burden

215
00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:53.310
from the users. So instead
of tracking what happens for

216
00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:56.910
the next one, two, three,
four hours after a bolus,

217
00:12:56.940 --> 00:13:00.240
you might rely on this
system throughout the magically, adjust

218
00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:06.360
to those unexpected changes or
that, that predictability and a

219
00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:10.050
good algorithm will have ways
of dealing with, with those

220
00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:13.830
unmeasured disturbances. It's not going
to work as well as

221
00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:18.270
if you could measure everything
perfectly, accurately and adjust for

222
00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:21.450
a mathematically, but there are
ways to deal with the

223
00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:25.230
uncertainties that the sickly, Yeah.
We always have numbers in

224
00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:28.080
our heads that we know,
like I know my, my

225
00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:31.410
ratio of insulin to grams,
and I'm sure that mine

226
00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:33.840
is different from yours. And
we think about those things,

227
00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:35.940
but I'll make sure that
we include a link to

228
00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:40.410
those. The 42 factors that
affect blood glucose. It's all

229
00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:42.270
kinds of things you wouldn't
think about like sleep, no

230
00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:46.110
too little sleep or someone
going through puberty or having

231
00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:49.410
bad allergies. And one of
those is making my day

232
00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:52.260
different than it was yesterday,
who knows which one of

233
00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:55.110
them are many of them,
multiple factors that are causing

234
00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:59.520
me trouble today. Th that
kind of requires a certain

235
00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:02.550
cognitive load. Doesn't it? Don't
you feel like there's a

236
00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:05.700
certain percentage of your brain.
That's always used up thinking

237
00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:09.270
about diabetes, even when you're
not thinking about it. Yeah.

238
00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:13.230
I think mental burden is
a big component of diabetes

239
00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:16.770
and that there's that complexity.
But like I mentioned before,

240
00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:22.290
I think it's, it's, there's
a tradeoff between that, that

241
00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.410
effort, that level of effort
you're willing to put into

242
00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:29.130
it or able to put
into it versus glycemic outcomes

243
00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:34.380
versus safety. And a lot
of people who, who liked

244
00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:38.550
to talk about diabetes and
in podcasts, or build their

245
00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:42.180
own gadgets, or really involved
in this, and really mathematical

246
00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:45.750
at trying to optimize for
glycaemic outcomes. But there are

247
00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:49.980
also people who just don't
care for all that complexity

248
00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:53.450
and just want to have
diabetes fade in the background,

249
00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:58.700
even if that is, they
don't get the absolute best

250
00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:02.300
time and range or best
glycaemic outcomes that they could.

251
00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:05.260
And again, for the context
for the folks that are

252
00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.720
listening, who may not be
familiar when we say things

253
00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:12.430
like time in range or
glycemic outcomes, that's basically you

254
00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:16.060
and I trying to simulate
that we don't have diabetes,

255
00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:18.940
right? Because isn't the theory
that if we can get

256
00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:22.450
the body to have as
normal sugar as possible, as

257
00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:25.960
long as possible, then we'll,
we'll die of something else

258
00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:28.000
we'll die of old age,
as opposed to dying of

259
00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:33.100
a diabetic complication. We're simulating
not having diabetes. Right. Right.

260
00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:35.440
So you want to stay
with it within a narrow

261
00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:38.650
range and mimic healthy blood
sugar levels as, as much

262
00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:41.920
as possible. And with a
lot of effort, you could

263
00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:45.460
do that pretty well. And
with adjustments in your diet,

264
00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:48.520
you could also do that
well, but it does take

265
00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:53.980
a lot of effort and
throughout people's lives. For example,

266
00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:56.500
for me, sometimes I, I
put a lot of emphasis

267
00:15:56.500 --> 00:16:03.070
on glycaemic outcomes and sometimes
it said, okay, an estimated

268
00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:07.330
glucose value of that that's
a little higher is okay,

269
00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:10.750
right now during this time
for my life. It's, it's

270
00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:13.210
okay. If my blood sugars
are a little bit higher,

271
00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:16.390
because I'm trying to achieve
all these, these other things.

272
00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:20.770
Exactly. Cause the stress, the
stress is itself difficult. So

273
00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:24.430
run a little high and
be more mentally healthy, Right.

274
00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:29.080
Or, or have bandwidth to
do other things. And, and

275
00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:32.260
I think if, if you're
mathematically inclined, it's easy, but

276
00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:36.730
that's why w new technologies
should relieve some of that

277
00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:39.940
burden. We should really be
doing this math for people

278
00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:44.710
and helping people who don't
want the absolute best clinical

279
00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:47.740
outcomes. But when to put
in a lot less effort,

280
00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:53.190
get much better outcomes that
they're getting today. Maybe not,

281
00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:56.350
not as good as someone
who's constantly fiddling with their

282
00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:59.950
device and estimating and knowing
about all these factors that

283
00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:04.600
the device doesn't know about,
like exercise, stress illness, trying

284
00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:07.510
to account for all of
these, but really giving them

285
00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:11.050
the best outcomes they could
have for their lifestyle. Yeah.

286
00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:13.930
That's a really great point
because I've been involved in

287
00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:17.950
the, in the DIY, the
do it yourself, diabetes community,

288
00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:22.240
since the nineties. And I
think it's enjoyable. And I

289
00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:25.120
find the math interesting. And
I find the tinkering interesting,

290
00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:28.000
but when I show it
to other people, they're like,

291
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.580
wow, that's just way more
work than I really need.

292
00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:34.630
Even the finger sticks part,
people are losing patients with.

293
00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:37.600
And that's why it's exciting
that there's new technology like

294
00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:42.460
the Dexcom G six, that
does not necessarily require finger

295
00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:45.730
sticks. And of course, the
company that you work for

296
00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:49.830
tandem has a thing called
control IQ combined. The no

297
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:53.190
finger sticks means that like
a huge percentage of people

298
00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:55.020
find that to be much
easier to use. They don't

299
00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:58.650
have to think about the
math. They just are there.

300
00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:00.570
I don't know. It almost
makes diabetes fade away for

301
00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:02.280
a moment and they can
kind of pretend that it's

302
00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:06.060
not happening, which is really
healthy, I think. Yep. It

303
00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:09.440
really allows people to go
do the other things that

304
00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:12.410
are important to them and
think about diabetes just a

305
00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:15.350
little bit less and don't
get me wrong. There's still

306
00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:18.020
a lot to think about.
There's a lot that go,

307
00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:21.170
that goes into an insulin
pump and they chose into

308
00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:26.060
diabetes education just to get
started using these devices, but

309
00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:28.700
we've come a long way.
And I think it's, it's

310
00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:32.270
a puzzle, not a mystery.
We know how to, how,

311
00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:34.610
how to do more. I
like that. That's a really

312
00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:37.220
great point. There is a
lot of cognitive load, but

313
00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:38.930
there's, it's just an, if,
if you're going to become

314
00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:41.690
diabetic, certainly today in 2020
is the time to do

315
00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:45.500
it. No one wants to
manage databases. If they can

316
00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:50.180
avoid it. That's why Mongo
DB made Mongo DB Atlas,

317
00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:54.650
a global cloud database service
that runs on AWS, GCP

318
00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:58.400
and Azure. You can deploy
a fully managed Mongo DB

319
00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:01.430
database in minutes with just
a few clicks or a

320
00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:06.710
few API calls, Mongo DB,
Atlas, automates deployment, automates updates,

321
00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:09.500
handles scaling, and more so
that you can focus on

322
00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:13.310
your application instead of taking
care of your database, you

323
00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:19.400
can get started free@mongodb.com slash
Atlas. Now, if you're already

324
00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:23.060
managing a Mongo DB deployment,
Atlas has a live migration

325
00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:26.690
service, so you can migrate
it easily with minimal downtime

326
00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:29.240
and then get back to
what matters. Stop managing your

327
00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:34.880
database and start using Mongo
DB, Atlas. I'm curious, what

328
00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:38.510
kind of problems would a
diabetes data scientist solve? Are

329
00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:43.040
you solving control, loop, local,
immediate problems? Are you thinking

330
00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:46.010
about huge datasets? Like I
have a massive personal data

331
00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:48.350
set of my blood sugar
every five minutes for the

332
00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:50.930
last decade. I don't know
what even kind of questions

333
00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:53.270
I could ask that would
make my life better. What

334
00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:56.270
kind of questions can a
diabetes data set scientists ask

335
00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:59.960
to make lives better? Well,
there, there are lots of

336
00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:03.410
it says problems. I think
data says is a very

337
00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:07.520
large term, encompasses a lot
of disciplines. And even though

338
00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:11.120
it's a recent term, there
have been data scientists around

339
00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:15.020
for awhile. So for, for
diabetes, I think we could,

340
00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:20.090
th data scientists could build
personalized algorithms for diabetes management,

341
00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:23.690
like the control algorithms that
we were talking about or

342
00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:27.770
prediction algorithms to see where
your blood glucose is headed

343
00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:32.480
or what the effect of,
of the inputs into your,

344
00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:36.740
your diabetes management they're having.
And then you can also

345
00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:41.450
use it to inform decisions
and to make simpler products.

346
00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:45.080
So when one of the
things I get very excited

347
00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:48.550
about is how we, we
can big data from a

348
00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:52.900
lot of users to evaluate
product features and feed those

349
00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:58.420
insights back into product development.
And how could we use

350
00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:02.710
data and simulations to further
simplify our products and make

351
00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:05.370
them easier for the user?
Very interesting. I'm just, I'm,

352
00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:09.420
I'm thinking about anonymized data
across multiple people. Like, you

353
00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:11.820
know, here's 10, here's the
blood sugar for 10,000 people.

354
00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:14.160
You're saying you can see
how they would do on

355
00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:16.980
a new product. Well, there
are certainly things you could

356
00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:20.670
simulate. And as George box
says, all models are wrong,

357
00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:25.200
some are useful. So it
depends what you're trying to

358
00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:27.390
do, but there are definitely
a lot of things you

359
00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:31.440
can evaluate the specially designed
tradeoffs and things you could

360
00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:34.710
test and say what well,
what, whether the differences between

361
00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:38.130
this choice or that choice.
And then there are also

362
00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:42.150
a lot of knobs and
the product, for example, one

363
00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:45.660
of the typical insulin pumps
on the market today from,

364
00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:49.530
from the different pump companies
has over a thousand settable

365
00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:54.540
parameters that someone could go
in and tweak manually. It's,

366
00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:58.890
it's a lot, for example,
for, for someone's physiology settings,

367
00:21:58.890 --> 00:22:02.850
you could set different values
of three parameters every 30

368
00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:06.300
minutes of the day. And
that, those aren't the only

369
00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:10.920
examples. So some of those
engaged users, like the ones

370
00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:13.680
in the do it yourself
community will spend their time

371
00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:17.850
analyzing their own data and
really thinking about what they

372
00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:21.000
did that day. What's affecting
their blood glucose levels and

373
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.010
turning these knobs to get
the perfect outcomes, but people

374
00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:29.400
who are not mathematically inclined
or don't want to put

375
00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:32.280
in as much effort into
this, don't find that fun,

376
00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:36.180
really have to think about
a lot. So can we

377
00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:41.070
use data science to figure
out how to remove some

378
00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:43.260
of those knobs for people
who don't want to think

379
00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:47.130
about them, or how do
set them by default? So

380
00:22:47.130 --> 00:22:51.600
that they're better for the
majority of the population, which

381
00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:55.530
ones are really important than
which ones are not things

382
00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:58.260
like that. That is really
interesting. Okay. So then back

383
00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:00.690
to the beginning of the
conversation around all of the

384
00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:04.110
different factors that affect blood
glucose, you know, 40 plus

385
00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:07.260
that are identified, but potentially
hundreds or thousands that are

386
00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:11.250
either not easily identified or
not easily measured, you're saying

387
00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:15.030
that you can experiment, you
can glean, you can assume

388
00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:19.260
you can make smart decisions
about those, those factors, thereby

389
00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:21.660
reducing the cognitive load for
people who may not want

390
00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:23.490
to, but then you can
also leave those knobs for

391
00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:26.280
those who want to click
advanced and maybe go and

392
00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:30.130
dig into that Exactly. Or
you for those people who

393
00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:33.000
want to go and do
more with it, he could

394
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.510
provide the information and then
they could decide what to

395
00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:39.090
do with it. That is
very interesting. The amount of

396
00:23:39.090 --> 00:23:42.810
little changes that I make
even now, 25, gosh, almost

397
00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:46.340
30 years in his experiments.
It's always feels like every

398
00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:49.430
day is an experiment. You
know, like for example, I'm

399
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:51.350
looking at my blood sugar
now, as it's starting to

400
00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:54.020
level off the blood sugar
values that we were just

401
00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:56.540
talking about, and I'm realizing,
you know, I should have

402
00:23:56.540 --> 00:24:00.680
taken my insulin 20 or
30 minutes before. That's an

403
00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:03.800
obvious first tip. It's something
I should have thought about

404
00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:08.570
beforehand, but here's yet another
day, another experiment where I'm

405
00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:10.790
like, Oh shoot. Now I'm
kicking myself. I should have,

406
00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:12.950
I should have done that.
I've learned that lesson. Why

407
00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:15.380
didn't I want to do
that? You could potentially have

408
00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:18.170
software tell me that you
could remind me and nudge

409
00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:22.510
me in the right direction.
I think different people find

410
00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:25.270
different things like that that
are really helpful for them.

411
00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:29.170
For me, for example, I,
I was an MDI user

412
00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:32.230
for a while. I was
waiting for this time when

413
00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:36.490
CGM would be accurate enough
that the extra complexity of

414
00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:39.310
a pump or having it
on, on my body would

415
00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:41.350
be worth it because I
would have all of this

416
00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:45.040
data to make the pump,
do exactly what I wanted.

417
00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:48.370
And at that time, when
I got on the pump,

418
00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:51.220
I thought CGM would be
good. It wasn't actually that

419
00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:55.060
great. That had a really
long lag for me. And

420
00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:59.350
it was getting low feeling
hypoglycemia, treating it then maybe

421
00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:03.520
an hour later, I'd get
the alarm. So I, but

422
00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:07.420
because this exposed me to
the pump, I could see

423
00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:12.510
the importance of having really
good basal rates. And there

424
00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:16.930
were, there are these guidelines
for doing experiments to set

425
00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:21.940
your basal rates correctly. And
if you do those, it's

426
00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:25.570
a lot of effort than
most doctors or they'd be

427
00:25:25.570 --> 00:25:28.990
these educators don't even tell
their patients about it because

428
00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:32.320
most people would not go
through all of that. That

429
00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:35.140
involves skipping a meal. And
just seeing as your blood

430
00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:37.990
sugar perfectly flat, where you
want it to be when,

431
00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:42.370
when you skip that meal
and tweaking your basal rate,

432
00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:45.580
until you get that blood
sugar to be perfectly flat

433
00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:48.280
when you're not eating or
performing in any kind of

434
00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:52.780
activity that affects blood, blood
sugar levels. But I've found

435
00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:56.050
personally that when you do
that, you're in this very

436
00:25:56.050 --> 00:25:59.230
stable state where you can
make a lot of decisions

437
00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:03.610
easily and your blood sugar
is a lot less variable.

438
00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:06.130
So for folks who may
not be familiar with those

439
00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:09.700
words of bolus is a,
an injection or a moment

440
00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:12.880
where a, a significant amount
of insulin is introduced into

441
00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:15.850
your body while basil is
those little, that little background

442
00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:18.640
insulin. Sometimes when I describe
it to non-diabetics, I think

443
00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:20.890
about when you're driving the
car and you're trying to

444
00:26:20.890 --> 00:26:23.140
keep the car straight on
the freeway for a long

445
00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:25.120
period of time, you know,
how you just kind of

446
00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:27.370
jiggle the wheel a little
bit, just to stay in

447
00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:29.470
the, you don't even know
you're doing it. You want

448
00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:31.810
to just stay straight. That's
your Bazell and then begging

449
00:26:31.810 --> 00:26:34.570
a big left turn or
big right turn. That's your,

450
00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:37.660
that's your bolus, but would
you just describe taking a

451
00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:41.650
day fasting, not eating, doing
a, an experiment on yourself

452
00:26:41.650 --> 00:26:45.420
as if you're a control
subject that requires a lot

453
00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:47.700
to asking a lot of
anybody to do, but at

454
00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:49.710
the same time, if someone
does do it, they should

455
00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:51.480
get some value out of
it and really learn more

456
00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:54.320
about their body. Yep. And
it gives you a really

457
00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:57.620
good place to start from
where you have to react

458
00:26:57.620 --> 00:27:01.340
to less. So I think
about it as putting all

459
00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:05.780
this effort upfront so that
when you're out doing the

460
00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:08.480
things you want to be
doing, you get interrupted by

461
00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:11.720
diabetes less. Yeah. You know,
it's interesting. I haven't done

462
00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:13.760
that in awhile. I think
it's been four or five

463
00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:15.470
years. It might be a
thing that one would want

464
00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:17.300
to do every once in
a while to just make

465
00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:20.300
sure nothing's changed. Right. Cause
we get older. We, our

466
00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:23.870
weight fluctuates our health fluctuates.
It might be time for

467
00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:25.670
me to do that again.
These are that, that's the

468
00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:27.680
other thing you get used
to your body and, and

469
00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:30.260
how it moves and how
it works. So you're always

470
00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:34.370
having to reinvent your own
diabetes therapy as you, as

471
00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:35.990
you deal with this disease
over a period of time.

472
00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:39.620
Yeah. And if you make
small changes, you could figure

473
00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:43.610
out when, when things are
changing throughout, if you start

474
00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:46.670
with, with, from a good
place where your basal rates

475
00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:49.940
are working, you might make
smaller adjustments without having to

476
00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:53.180
fast in between two to
test this really accurately. But

477
00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:56.720
I think it's really important
that the beginning, and then

478
00:27:56.750 --> 00:28:00.350
just, just being aware of
it, then making adjustments, when,

479
00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:04.280
when necessary, How quickly do
you think that the idea

480
00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:07.160
of an often automated insulin
dosing system is going to

481
00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:09.260
become like the standard of
care? There's a lot of

482
00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:13.070
talk about them right now.
They're available to those who

483
00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:15.950
can get the insurance, who
can afford them. But I

484
00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:17.270
do think, I don't think
it would be fair to

485
00:28:17.270 --> 00:28:19.400
say that it is the
standard of care right now.

486
00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:22.850
It's kind of an emerging
standard. I think automated insulin

487
00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:26.330
delivery systems that are great.
Then, like you were saying,

488
00:28:26.330 --> 00:28:29.270
people like us who have
great insurance and have access

489
00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:33.140
to them, it really removes
some of the burden and

490
00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:37.430
improves clinical outcomes. So it
it's great, but it's still

491
00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:40.340
not accessible to a lot
of people. And part of

492
00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:44.420
it is cost. Part of
it is, you know, geography,

493
00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:49.340
the healthcare system, there are
also complexity issues like with

494
00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:53.120
all technology initially it's great
for early adopters and the

495
00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:56.120
only through, through simplifying it
and making it easier and

496
00:28:56.120 --> 00:29:02.660
easier to use becomes standard
of care. And then even

497
00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:05.450
insulin pumps. To your point,
you said that you used

498
00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:09.470
MDI multiple daily injections for
awhile, even insulin pumps themselves,

499
00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:12.020
aren't quite standard of care
because of all the different

500
00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:15.380
reasons that you described. I
wonder at some point, have

501
00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:20.110
you ever felt as a
diabetic that they, the, the,

502
00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:22.790
your doctors, those, the people
in power have told you

503
00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:26.300
that we'll have this cured
in five years? I feel

504
00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:28.010
like for the last 20
or 30 years, they've been

505
00:29:28.010 --> 00:29:29.600
telling me just five more
years and we'll have a

506
00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:32.450
solution. And it feels like
maybe from five years from

507
00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:34.670
now automated insulin dosing will
be the standard of care.

508
00:29:34.670 --> 00:29:36.380
And then they'll be another
thing. And another thing, do

509
00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:37.910
you see an end to
this? Or what, what do

510
00:29:37.910 --> 00:29:40.880
you think the perfect answer
is? Well, that's interesting. No

511
00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:45.210
one's ever promised Me a
cure so far. I, I

512
00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:47.710
think obviously if we had
a cure, it could all

513
00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:52.150
stop, but so far we've
been addressing diabetes management, not

514
00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:57.130
the underlying causes. So I
think in that area, I

515
00:29:57.130 --> 00:30:01.690
think the first automated insulin
delivery systems were built in

516
00:30:01.690 --> 00:30:04.090
the, there were two when
they were built in the

517
00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:07.540
sixties and seventies. So there
was a portable one that

518
00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:11.380
someone was wearing with a
backpack out there in the

519
00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:14.020
sixties. And I think it
worked pretty well. And then

520
00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:17.650
there was when in the
hospital system that was also

521
00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:21.310
working pretty well. It was
very big system, definitely not

522
00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:25.570
portable. So it took a
really long time to actually

523
00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:32.950
have an actual portable wearable
device. And they think that

524
00:30:32.970 --> 00:30:36.910
that kind of improvement, like
the, the algorithm improvements came.

525
00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:40.090
There's a lot that we
were able to achieve algorithmically,

526
00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:43.330
but there's also a lot
left to do in terms

527
00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:46.930
of usability to make this
work for everyone, to be

528
00:30:46.930 --> 00:30:50.230
able to just put it
on and do nothing, which

529
00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:53.380
I think is the Holy
grail of a fully closed

530
00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:55.870
loop systems. Just, just put
it on and it just

531
00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:58.210
works and you don't have
to know anything or do

532
00:30:58.210 --> 00:31:01.260
anything. And you feel that
that's a problem that we

533
00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:04.800
will solve with, to a
large part with software, with

534
00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:06.900
data science, like there is
work to be done. We

535
00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:09.750
have not solved this yet.
We haven't found the answer,

536
00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:11.670
but we will be able
to, or these will be

537
00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:13.320
able to move it forward
a little bit every year.

538
00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:16.080
I think we'll be able
to move it forward. There's

539
00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:18.840
still a lot left to
be done. And a lot

540
00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:23.070
that we know how to
solve humans will always have

541
00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:25.200
to be in the loop.
It's, it's your safety. You're

542
00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:29.820
always have to change your
devices, do a little maintenance

543
00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:33.660
troubleshoot when things go wrong.
But I think we, we

544
00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:36.450
can, there's still a lot
to be done and we,

545
00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:39.690
we know how to do
a lot of it. Well,

546
00:31:39.690 --> 00:31:42.780
thank you so much, dr.
Alex Constantine for chatting with

547
00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:44.970
me today. Thank you very
much for having me. It

548
00:31:44.970 --> 00:31:47.820
was fun. This has been
another episode of Hanselminutes and

549
00:31:47.820 --> 00:32:01.080
we'll see you again next
week. <inaudible>.
