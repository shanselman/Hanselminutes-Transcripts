Hey folks. You're a very
good developer, probably regardless. You

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.140
do write bugs. That's unavoidable.
What is affordable is wasting

3
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.750
time trying to track down
the cause of those bugs

4
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.190
century.io provides full stack error
tracking that lets you monitor

5
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.980
and fix problems. In real
time, you can see the

6
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.130
severity and the scope of
the error. Get immediate access

7
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.740
to the stack, trace connect
the problem to the commit

8
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.370
that caused it and fix
it without delay century to

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.470
name so common that they
have to include the top

10
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.660
level domain in their advertising
to make sure you remember

11
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.360
it. century.io, that century dot
I O open source, full

If you can program it,
they can make it far

14
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.020
easier to fix any errors
you encounter with it. Your

15

16
00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:06.110
<inaudible>. Hi, this is Scott
Hanselman. This is another episode

17
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.170
of Hansel minutes. And today
I'm talking with truest is

18
00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.920
a postdoctoral research scientist at
Facebook reality labs. He's worked

19
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.490
at Pixar and he's written
a great new book called

20
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.510
cloth simulation for computer graphics.
How are you? Hi, I'm

21
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.000
good. How are you? I'm
very well. I'm happy to

22
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.430
be talking to you. I'm
trying to learn as much

23
00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.280
as I can about games
and computer graphics and how

24
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.740
things are built. And I
had a gentleman on a

25
00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.380
couple of weeks ago talking
about the game engine behind

26
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.250
doom, and now you've got
this new book out cloth

27
00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.910
simulation for computer graphics, a
little light reading, and I'm

28
00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.550
excited to talk to you
about it. This is a,

29
00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.650
not necessarily a 500 page
book about like science it's

30
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.150
really quite accessible, isn't it?
Yeah, I think that was

31
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.010
the main goal that I
had is that if you

32
00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.480
want to try it and
get into like any type

33
00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.440
of simulation, it's usually very,
very dense math and very

34
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.020
technical terms. And I tried
to write the book, which

35
00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.350
is more accessible with a
little bit of background story.

36
00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.120
How like people use it
an industry, whereas where all

37
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.910
the algorithms coming from, how,
what does the math actually

38
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.090
mean more intuitively? So this
is like not intending to

39
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.390
be a, an overview of
all things happening in the

40
00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.570
space, but rather an on
ramp into the space. Exactly.

41
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.910
So it's not covering like
the latest years of research,

42
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.180
but it gives you a
very nice introduction or like

43
00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.160
the different steps you would
take if you were to

44
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.010
get into this type of
study. So it starts with

45
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.680
very simple two motion techniques,
which of course have some

46
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.740
like many limitations. And then
it, instead of we advanced

47
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.800
to more complex techniques and
we do actually mention the

48
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.840
technique that is used in
industry today, but of course

49
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.090
there's many other additional techniques
have been developed since. So

50
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.090
it's definitely not covering the
latest and greatest research, but

51
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.580
if you understand everything in
the book, it should be

52
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.250
straightforward to go to those
research papers that you can

53
00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.220
find it like SIGGRAPH for
other conferences. No. When I

54
00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.490
hear about what I think
as a lay person are

55
00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.840
highly specialized or highly technical
things, I think to myself,

56
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.690
Oh, there's probably three people
in the world that care

57
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.150
about this. But in fact,
you say that this is

58
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.850
actually a vast amount of
people doing research in this

59
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.550
space. And every year they're
creating new literature on cloth

60
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.660
simulation. I wouldn't say vast,
but there's definitely a fair

61
00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.060
amount of people working on
it just because there's a

62
00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.330
lot of applications at the
moment, I would say. So

63
00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.180
it's heavily used in movie
production for special effects or

64
00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.400
like animated features. And then
also there's the fashion industry

65
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.880
which use maybe virtual prototyping
or virtual fitting rooms. So

66
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.920
it definitely has a lot
of applications, which makes it

67
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.850
interesting for, for people that
work in, in the field.

68
00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.960
And do we only care
about cloth simulation for, you

69
00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.420
know, making the guy in
the Assassin's creed, like a

70
00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.260
run more realistically or what
are other use cases? Well,

71
00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.510
that's a great use case,
of course, but other use

72
00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.800
cases are, well, like I
said, movies. So any movie

73
00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.110
that you go watch, if
it has special effects like

74
00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.810
explosions and whatnot or virtual
environments, it probably has some

75
00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.720
sort of cost similarity to
maybe for simulating leaves or

76
00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.100
actual clothing on, on, on
characters. And obviously for animated

77
00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.880
movies, all the clothing, maybe
the curtain or a flag

78
00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.210
waving in the background, those
are all stimulated materials. So

79
00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:18.630
that's one more of the
entertainment industry applications. And I

80
00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.360
think one other big application
is, is like I said,

81
00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.660
like fashion, for instance, like
online retail, I think a

82
00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.770
lot of companies would love
very fast computer software that

83
00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.070
can simulate clothing on virtual
bodies so that people can

84
00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.210
try on clothes virtually before
buying them. Cause that would

85
00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.940
have a lot of economical
impact. Of course. Wow. That's

86
00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.970
interesting. That would imply that
I could potentially, I'm just

87
00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.940
imagining some future world here
where I put on my

88
00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.270
VR headset and some, at
some point I've either scanned

89
00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.240
myself with a webcam or
with my phone and then

90
00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.850
I stand in a virtual
place and try clothes on

91
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.400
Basically. Yeah, exactly. And then
the idea is that you

92
00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:00.540
have your own body model,
that's a, a good estimate

93
00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.130
of your own body. And
then you can try on

94
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.560
the clothing and then they
should represent the actual physical

95
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.270
clothing. And then you can
see if it's drapes well

96
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.550
on your body. If you
should go get a size

97
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.590
bigger, get a size smaller,
it's like going to a

98
00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.300
store and actually trying it
on. Right. So you can

99
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.120
actually see a drape. Yeah.
And it doesn't feel like

100
00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.340
we're that far away from
it. I noticed recently when

101
00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.850
my iPhone updated, it has
a measurement tool that allows

102
00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:23.370
me to basically use it
as a virtual ruler just

103
00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.630
by moving it in space.
It's pretty straightforward to extrapolate

104
00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:29.820
to a world in the
next couple of years where

105
00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.980
I could do this. Yeah.
I think it's definitely possible.

106
00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:35.220
There's a few Engineering things
to overcome of course, and

107
00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.040
make it fast and reliable,
like, like any good application,

108
00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.680
but it's definitely not farfetched
to have it in the

109
00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.470
next coming years. It's probably
not 10 years out. I've

110
00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.290
read some of the papers
that you've published and I've

111
00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:48.900
looked at different articles as
well as some animations that

112
00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.410
have come out with various
papers in the space. And

113
00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.390
it's one of those things
where I think when it

114
00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:57.800
works, we, as the lay
people don't think about it,

115
00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.900
but when it doesn't work,
we go, wow. That person,

116
00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.770
that virtual person is really
awkward. Yeah. That's, that's the

117
00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:05.560
difficult thing. And especially with
people in their faces, it's

118
00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.610
really hard to convince people,
but usually for clothing, unless

119
00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:12.250
you work in clothing, like
in the simulation of it,

120
00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:15.100
like you don't typically focus
on, on what people are

121
00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.890
wearing. Like are the faults
realistic? It doesn't collide with

122
00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:19.750
the body or has it,
does it have like an

123
00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.930
accurate friction models? I think
as a viewer, you're not,

124
00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:24.910
you're typically focused on the
face, which makes it really

125
00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:26.740
hard to recreate the face.
But we get away with

126
00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:29.800
like the clothing a little
bit easier. I have a

127
00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.040
friend of mine who has
a master's degree in costume

128
00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:37.510
design and another degree in
something around like English history

129
00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:40.930
or English literature. And they
went to see like Robin

130
00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:43.180
hood or something. And she
said that she had to

131
00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:46.270
walk out because as a
person who is an expert

132
00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:48.730
in this space, she was
like, I couldn't, I couldn't

133
00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:51.910
focus because the stitching was
wrong on Robin Hood's shirt.

134
00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:55.270
Like that stitch wasn't invented
until whatever, whatever. I wonder

135
00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:58.210
if in your space, now
that you're doing postdoctoral research,

136
00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:00.250
do you have trouble going
to see a movie? And

137
00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:02.320
you, this guy can't watch
this because that cloth is

138
00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.380
completely wrong. And that flag
is totally distracting. Nothing. Not

139
00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:07.330
that it's wrong, but I
definitely do have to watch

140
00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.490
it twice, once to focus
on like the clothing and

141
00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:11.860
the simulations. But they do
that where they like did

142
00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:13.870
some manual tweaking and then
once for the story, of

143
00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:16.480
course. So it's not like
I'm, I can't watch it

144
00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.160
cause it's not good. Definitely
not. But it's more like

145
00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.990
out of interest, like how
did they pull this effect

146
00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:22.510
off? How did they do
that? That's good. So for

147
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:24.760
the most part, you're not
watching to hate, you're watching

148
00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:28.330
to appreciate And to learn.
Right. So yeah, for sure.

149
00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:31.600
I read in an article
that Pixar had a challenge

150
00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.930
with the movie Coco because
the bodies underneath the cloth

151
00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:37.630
were a, were not really
bodies. They were a skeleton.

152
00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:40.360
That's the problem that they
had is that skeletons are

153
00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.690
really pointy and it was
hard to make it collide

154
00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:47.650
with the clothing without puncturing
through the clothing. So yeah,

155
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:51.040
David did a whole revamp
of the, of the simulation

156
00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:55.000
engine to fix all of
that. So is that an,

157
00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:57.130
is that an engine, like
speaking about how you would

158
00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:01.240
do this for a movie,
I'm imagining that you get

159
00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.880
it mostly right. And then
the director of the movie

160
00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:06.610
says, well, everything's great. Except
in this one part where

161
00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:08.830
he turns his body, this
is wrong. Do you have

162
00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:10.960
to then go back and
rebuild your engine and change

163
00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:14.710
your equation? It's not necessarily
like that low level that

164
00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:17.980
you have to change your
equations. Typically we, or one

165
00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:22.060
would try to find constraints
or extra additional elements on

166
00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:23.830
top of it. You build
on top of it to,

167
00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:28.000
to enforce certain like director
comments or anything like that.

168
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.160
Yeah. It was at work.
Maybe you could explain the

169
00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.100
pipeline a little bit because
from the outside, I know

170
00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:35.260
that there's the three D
modelers, but there's also the

171
00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.650
people who make the tools
that make the movies. Yeah.

172
00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:41.020
So there's, there's a lot
of people involved of course,

173
00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:43.840
but the big picture is
that you have the artists

174
00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.870
and they create the clothing
garments. And th the garments

175
00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:49.690
were then used as the
initial state for the simulator.

176
00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:52.180
And then the simulator will
take body motion and the

177
00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:55.410
environment such as a wind
gravity, and then it will

178
00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:57.690
advance the simulation and forward
in time. So you get

179
00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:01.380
the moving close on the
body. And then, so then

180
00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:03.850
you get your simulation result,
which is a video of,

181
00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:06.730
of the clothing. And then
typically would show it to

182
00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:08.850
the director. And they would
say like, Oh, I like

183
00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:11.100
it. Or I like to
request some changes. And then

184
00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:13.440
you go, the artists would
go back and try to

185
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:17.160
change the simulation parameters. Maybe
like change gravity or the

186
00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.700
wind there may be, have
like explicit constraints that you

187
00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:22.620
put onto the clothing to
make it do certain things.

188
00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:24.630
And then you kind of
iterate over that. So you

189
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:28.730
can finally get the result
that you want. Do you

190
00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:32.270
think about the state of
the cloth in the sense

191
00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:34.730
of, I mean, I suppose
you could model that like

192
00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:37.220
the universe, like the, like
the quantum machine that we

193
00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:39.710
live in models it, and
think about the molecules, or

194
00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:41.270
you could think about it
in another, in an, in

195
00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:46.940
a more holistic view. Yeah.
I think in graphics, since

196
00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:49.880
we're not necessarily concerned with
the right solution, but more

197
00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:54.860
with a reliable solution that
looks good. We tend to

198
00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:58.790
discrete ties just using triangles.
Cause that's the very typical

199
00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:01.400
in computer graphics and computers
are optimized for that. So

200
00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:04.490
like the clothing would be
divided into little triangles and

201
00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:07.610
then we would simulate over
that. Okay. So then you're

202
00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:12.860
thinking about it as a
continuous like elastic sheet. So

203
00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:14.720
there's a, you have to
get, read the book to

204
00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.780
get the full, the different
methods, but there's different approaches

205
00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:19.880
to it. So one, I
would say the most simple

206
00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:22.880
approach is probably just like,
do look at it as

207
00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:25.400
like a bunch of point
masses that are connected by

208
00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.340
Springs. And then by doing
that, you can create something

209
00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:30.200
that looks like clothing, but
it's of course not very

210
00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:35.030
physically accurate. Right. And then
more advanced models is where

211
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:37.250
you actually look at the,
at the triangle there's little

212
00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:40.010
sheets of cloth, and then
you assimilate over the triangle.

213
00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:43.460
So they're not just separate
masses that are connected. So

214
00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:47.420
over the decades of research
in this space over the

215
00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:49.400
last, you know, 40, 50
years when people have been

216
00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:51.440
thinking about these things, when
computers are starting to get

217
00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:55.550
to that point, are these
varying ways to express cloth,

218
00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:58.340
something that comes out, we
use it for a while

219
00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:00.230
and then we, we get
rid of it and we

220
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:02.390
stopped doing it. And we
now use the new way,

221
00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:06.200
or is it something where
there's a toolbox of several

222
00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.930
ways and you can really
use them on a case

223
00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:11.660
by case basis. There's, there's
definitely a toolbox. And I

224
00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:13.970
guess it depends on, on
your use case. Like if

225
00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:16.670
you want, if you like,
you probably wouldn't use the

226
00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:18.680
same algorithm for a game
as you would for a

227
00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:21.350
movie, just because the quality
is so different, but then

228
00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:23.570
again, like one is really
fast and one is slower.

229
00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:27.170
So you kind of have
that trade off there. I

230
00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:29.900
think the, the, the algorithms
are, are pretty stable, but

231
00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:34.430
you get these additional research
findings, whereas like maybe a

232
00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:36.530
better collision model or maybe
a better fiction model and

233
00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:38.930
you can, can swap out
components or add into what

234
00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:41.360
GERD this thing, a solver.
I don't think it's very

235
00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:43.470
typical that people would like
write a new solver every

236
00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:45.590
year, every year, every other
year, just because a new

237
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:49.370
technique came up. I see.
So looking in the overview

238
00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:51.230
of the book, as you
kind of walk through the

239
00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:53.950
research from the eighties through
the nineties, the late nineties,

240
00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:56.230
as people start to learn
what the, you know, what

241
00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:58.240
is either the right way
or a way that is

242
00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:02.170
going to work, moving up
into triangle based cloth simulations

243
00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:04.630
in the late, in the
late nineties. When did people

244
00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:07.000
start thinking about the state
of the cloth? Like burlap

245
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:09.520
is going to move differently
than silk. And if it's

246
00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:12.690
wet, it's gonna move differently
than if it's dry. Yeah.

247
00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:15.270
So that's, that's kind of
like, there's, this is the,

248
00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:17.220
the graphics approach to things.
And then there's also the

249
00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:20.250
engineering approach right. With, so
there's a textile industry has

250
00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:22.830
been, they use different models,
which are, which are much

251
00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:26.460
more accurate and take the
material parameters into account. Whereas

252
00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:29.640
graphics is we have different
material parameters, but we're mostly

253
00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.740
interested in how does it
look and how does it

254
00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:35.070
behave rather than if I
apply this much force on

255
00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:37.650
it, how much millimeters would
it like stretch or something

256
00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:39.540
like that. Right. Which is
a very engineering kind of

257
00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:42.090
purpose that you want. So
people have definitely be an

258
00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:45.420
interested in, because you know,
you want to simulate different

259
00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:47.460
materials and you want to
have it behave like the

260
00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:50.190
materials. But usually I would
say that there's some sort

261
00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:53.130
of library of coefficients that
have been developed by an

262
00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:55.290
artist or someone that says
like, Oh, this is, this

263
00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:58.860
is linen. This is wool.
This is leather, but it's

264
00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:01.320
not necessarily, you don't necessarily
have to like, do the

265
00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:03.820
actual stress tests on a,
on a mechanical bench and

266
00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:06.930
then get those coefficients from
there. Cause the oldest simulation

267
00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:10.710
methods are approximate to right.
Well ultimately they're just picking

268
00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:14.040
a number that looks right.
Like for example, I had

269
00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:19.710
someone on recently who worked
on flight simulators and she

270
00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:22.680
would go up in the
actual airplane with like physical

271
00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:26.850
mechanics, physical equipment and measure
G-forces as she spun around

272
00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:28.410
in the thing and then
come down and then make

273
00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:33.510
sure that her software, you
know, expressed reality, which was

274
00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:36.120
more interesting to her than
what it looked like. It

275
00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:39.960
had to feel. Right. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. I think for

276
00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:42.090
graphics, we're mostly interested what
it looks like, but then

277
00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:44.700
of course, if you want
to validate your software, there's

278
00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:47.760
has to have reasonable results.
Right. So you can definitely

279
00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:51.780
compare it to reality, but
it's not that it's like

280
00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:54.600
the ultimate test is to
get exactly what reality does.

281
00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:58.590
Cause there's so many, you
have discretization error like approximation,

282
00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:00.660
like if your triangles are
big, it's not the same.

283
00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:03.990
If having real, really small
triangles, there's like friction models,

284
00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:06.300
you're colliding with the world.
So you have to like

285
00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:09.030
model the world perfectly too.
So it's really hard to

286
00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:12.450
recreate the physical world in
a simulation, I would say.

287
00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:16.740
And how, what kind of
improvements have happened in, is

288
00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:20.370
it, is it just algorithmic
improvements or is it also

289
00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:22.830
the fact that the people
making the algorithm know that

290
00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:25.110
processors are a hundred or
a thousand or 10,000 or

291
00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:27.120
a million times faster than
they were when the original

292
00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:32.010
algorithms were Greeted? Yeah. So
there's, there's definitely the, the

293
00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:34.920
hardware is definitely important recently.
And especially with GPS becoming

294
00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:38.790
really important, different types of
solvers have also been, been

295
00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:40.980
developed. So one thing that
comes to mind is it's

296
00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:44.820
position based dynamics, which paralyzes
really, really well. So that

297
00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:49.020
would fit really nicely onto
GPS. So, so yeah, there's

298
00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:52.520
definitely a relation between algorithms
and, and hardware that is

299
00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:56.110
used these days. And, and
when, when, when thinking about

300
00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:58.630
three D graphics or a
game where you have to

301
00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:01.600
do it in real time,
I wonder, do you have

302
00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:04.000
to simulate, like for example,
someone's running and they're wearing

303
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.990
a dress, do you simulate
the totality of the dress?

304
00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:10.420
Both what can be seen
and what isn't seen because

305
00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:13.660
what is occluded or what
is behind the person might

306
00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:16.390
affect how the cloth drapes
in the front, or can

307
00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:21.220
you optimize by only draping?
What can be seen? Well,

308
00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:23.050
that's hard of course. Cause
what if the character turns

309
00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:25.780
around, right? Like the cough
does have needs to have

310
00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:29.380
a state like for the
whole garment. Right. I think

311
00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:32.140
for games, what typically would
be done is you have

312
00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:35.560
two resolutions of the garment.
And one is the assimilation

313
00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:38.950
mesh, which is a geometry,
which is usually pretty low

314
00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:41.500
resolution. And then one is
the, what we call the

315
00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:43.690
render geometry is which we
show to their user, which

316
00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:46.180
is what exactly seen on
this screen. And so this

317
00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:48.580
is more higher resolution. And
then we deformed the high

318
00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:51.400
resolution with the results of
our low resolution simulation. So

319
00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.680
we get these details on
the garment, maybe like a

320
00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:57.280
bow tie or buttons or
stitches from the scenes, but

321
00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:00.100
we don't actually simulate all
that detail. But by, by

322
00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:03.490
moot, by the forming the
high resolution with the movement

323
00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:06.430
of the low resolution, we
can kind of fake simulating

324
00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:09.280
the whole thing. Right. Ah,
interesting. And then I suppose

325
00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:12.010
that could be a, that
resolution of the mesh, the

326
00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:15.190
resolution of the, how the
cloth drapes versus the texture

327
00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:17.920
of the clause could be
on a person by person

328
00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:20.950
basis. Like someone with a
big thick dress would need

329
00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:23.560
lower resolution than someone who
has on only a tee

330
00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:25.600
shirt. Like what I'm saying
is that you would need

331
00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:28.630
higher resolution and more triangles
if the detailed mattered of

332
00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:31.510
a closeup or the clothes
or the person got you

333
00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:33.400
or the thinness of the
fabric and you might say,

334
00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:36.370
yeah, well the wrinkles don't
look right because the underlying

335
00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:39.730
mesh Of course. Yeah, exactly.
And it's also collisions with

336
00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:42.610
the body, right? Like if,
if, if your triangle it's

337
00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:44.350
the body, you don't want
to go inside the body.

338
00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:46.480
But if the triangle is
really large, it might create

339
00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:48.940
artifacts. Cause you're pushing the
whole triangle out. Whereas if

340
00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:50.770
it's smaller, it would be
more, more of a subtle

341
00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:53.950
effect. So yeah, there's definitely
the trade off between like

342
00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:56.560
high resolution is better quality,
but it's also slower of

343
00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:59.260
course. Oh, interesting. Okay. So
then that means that the

344
00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.990
triangle size or the size
of the, the granularity of

345
00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:03.490
the mesh and forgive me
if I'm using the wrong

346
00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:06.190
terms here, you know, would
change based on where it

347
00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:08.740
is on the body. If
it's in the armpits or

348
00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:10.900
on the elbow, it's going
to want you'd want more

349
00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:14.350
detail than if it were
just draping around That's that's

350
00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:17.110
yeah. Something that definitely could
be considered as an optimization.

351
00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:22.270

At one point, if you're

362
00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:03.690
making a movie though, does
your algorithm get into the

363
00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:07.440
face of the art director
where it's correct and it

364
00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:09.780
looks okay to you, but
they, they want on a

365
00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:12.710
frame by frame or a
scene by scene way Change

366
00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:16.460
things. Yeah. This is actually
very common. The simulator will

367
00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:18.860
tell you we're approximating physics.
So the similar would tell

368
00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:20.900
you like, look, this is
what physics would do, right?

369
00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:23.420
This is what the real
world would like. It's approximation

370
00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:26.090
of that. But then for,
for movies and especially like

371
00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:29.870
animated movies, which can be
highly art directed, the clothing

372
00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:32.270
of the characters, kind of
give something away about the

373
00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:35.330
character. Maybe the villain in
the movie would have like

374
00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:37.970
more like pointy clothing or
the silhouettes would be more

375
00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:40.790
like sharp edges. Whereas like
if it's someone you're supposed

376
00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:42.860
to, like in a movie,
the clothing will be softer

377
00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:44.960
where the folds will be
like rounder and not as

378
00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:47.900
like Chris. So this is
these very subtle cues that

379
00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:49.610
the director wants to give
to you as a viewer,

380
00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:51.290
do S do like, is
this going to be a

381
00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:52.760
good person to move? You're
a bad person in the

382
00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:56.300
movie. So artists definitely want
this control over their simulations,

383
00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:59.870
where they can specify where
they want folds to forum.

384
00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:02.330
How, how big should these
folds be? When should they

385
00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:06.140
form? So there's definitely a
lot of research and, and

386
00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:08.630
know how that exists in
these big studios to create

387
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:11.210
these simulations, to adapt them,
to do exactly what the

388
00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:13.790
artist wants. And I think
this is typically called art

389
00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:16.160
tractability. So this is something
that you run on top

390
00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:19.280
of your simulation algorithm to
do enforce what the artist

391
00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:21.680
wants. So you kind of,
so you, you make it

392
00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:23.960
art directed. So you follow
what the artist says it

393
00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:26.270
wants you to do, but
then you also use physics

394
00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:28.280
to have something that looks
believable to the viewer. So

395
00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:30.260
you have to try to
find this, this trade off

396
00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:34.160
between a realism and goal
States that you're trying to

397
00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:37.340
hit. It seems like whether
it's movies or games that

398
00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:40.850
there's definitely this push towards
photo realism. Everyone wants it

399
00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:45.130
to look hyper-realistic I wonder
though, is that this the

400
00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:47.840
same movement within cloth? Are
you always wanting it to

401
00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:50.360
be as realistic as possible?
Or do they ever just

402
00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:52.310
say, well, forget physics. I
want it to look like

403
00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:55.550
this. Well, it's, there's, there's
definitely different things that you're

404
00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:57.980
interested in, right? So one
thing is you want it

405
00:19:57.980 --> 00:19:59.630
to look really realistic and
you want it to be

406
00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:01.910
effortless. Like you just want
to press the star and

407
00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:03.620
you want it to do
what you want, but for

408
00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:05.960
simulations, this is typically not
the case because there's a

409
00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:08.660
number of things you have
to take into account. Like

410
00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:11.120
the simulation can fail sometimes.
Yet, if you miss a

411
00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:13.160
collision, then you have like
a poke, true, like the

412
00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:15.560
body coming, or like the
clothing is penetrating the body,

413
00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:17.960
which is not a fish,
it creates visual artifacts that

414
00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:19.640
you don't want. Right. It's
like the wrong solution to

415
00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:22.430
the problem. And then other
things that you typically have

416
00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:25.430
with these numerical algorithm is
that they're not always stable,

417
00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:27.920
which basically means that if
your time step to advance,

418
00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:30.380
the simulation forward in time
is too big. You can

419
00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:35.060
have maybe oscillations or the
simulations giving, producing really weird

420
00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:38.330
behavior or visually disturbing behavior.
So there's, there's things like

421
00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:40.010
that that you have to
take into account. So I

422
00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:44.570
think realism is definitely a
big, important thing, but then

423
00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:48.280
also the stability or the
reliability of the algorithm is

424
00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:50.920
important too, because if you're
on a simulation, that's going

425
00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:53.110
to take maybe for a
movie, it might take like

426
00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:56.560
several hours. You kind of
want to seem like to

427
00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:59.560
reliably know that it's worth
running those two hours and

428
00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:02.350
not like seeing that, Oh,
it filled after like two

429
00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:06.630
frames, right? How different are
the tools and implementations that

430
00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:09.750
focus on real time as
the goal versus the ones

431
00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:12.810
that are offline more like
creating a movie, I assume

432
00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:15.000
that they don't necessarily render
that render a movie from

433
00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.840
Pixar In real time. No,
definitely not. Yeah. I think

434
00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:22.080
that one of the things
that it's notable in the

435
00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:26.010
algorithms is that the more,
the slower the algorithm, the

436
00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:28.980
more accurate usually. So they
will like a model the

437
00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:32.370
real world better. Whereas for
games you're interested in, in

438
00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:34.890
the dynamics and you want
something that, that looks good

439
00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:38.160
and is very reactive to
the player movement. So you

440
00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:41.850
use something that's maybe more
approximate, but really fast. Are

441
00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:44.850
these things being driven by,
by data? Like, can you

442
00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:49.200
preprocess how clothing moves? Can
you look at it, analyze

443
00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:51.540
cloth behavior in real time
and like store it in

444
00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:54.000
some kind of a machine
learning model and teach machine,

445
00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:56.460
how things move or is
it always more like Ray

446
00:21:56.460 --> 00:22:01.080
tracing? No, there are definitely
like data driven approaches that

447
00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:04.830
exist in research. There's been,
been a lot of papers

448
00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:07.800
that have been published on
this, where you would maybe

449
00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:10.080
do a low resolution simulation
and then you would feel

450
00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:12.870
like, try to place wrinkles
on top of the clothing

451
00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:15.720
based on simulations that you've
run in an offline process

452
00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:18.240
before that. So, you know,
like, Oh if I, if

453
00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:20.280
I make this movement, these
wrinkles will form. So you

454
00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:22.560
can kind of copy over
that data onto the geometry.

455
00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:25.860
And then more recently there
have been a more like

456
00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:29.880
machine learning, AI techniques where
they, they, they learn a

457
00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:32.760
model that can Hanse that
can add details in a

458
00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:35.520
UV space, in a normal
map. So you can have

459
00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:38.010
these really fast seem like,
or like you have a

460
00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:41.670
low resolution simulation and you
can add details based on

461
00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:44.640
some, some machine learning approach.
Okay, interesting. So I'm trying

462
00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:47.100
to visualize the layers here.
There's the potential of the

463
00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:50.400
mesh layer that is the,
the cloth in a low

464
00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:53.940
resolution group of, of, of
triangles. And then there's the

465
00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:56.340
texture over the top of
it. And then the normal

466
00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:58.800
map goes onto the top
of that. Yeah. The, so

467
00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:02.640
the normal maps is how
it, like there's this, this

468
00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:04.770
paper card called deep wrinkles.
And what they do is

469
00:23:04.770 --> 00:23:07.080
they use a normal map
to change the normals locally

470
00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:10.920
on the surface. So they
can, they can, they can

471
00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:13.320
add a wrinkle detail in,
in the texture, like in

472
00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:17.160
the, in the viewport, based
on the light and flick

473
00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:21.810
how they affect the surface.
So it's so interesting to

474
00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:24.900
be like a, an armchair
quarterback because you know how

475
00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:26.490
you watch football and you
go, Oh, I can do

476
00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:30.930
that. Like when I read
the deep wrinkles paper beforehand,

477
00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:32.880
I was like, of course,
of course that's how you

478
00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:35.160
do it. Like after the
fact, like I get it

479
00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:37.890
now, how often does that
come up in this space

480
00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:40.020
of research where someone comes
up with an idea and

481
00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:42.930
then everyone's like, Oh yes,
it's been out there just

482
00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:45.350
waiting for someone to pluck
it out of, out of

483
00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:48.290
obscurity, this idea, The ideas
definitely go up. It's not

484
00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:50.360
it's of course, a lot
of work to first get

485
00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:52.070
the idea and then prove
that it works and then

486
00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:54.440
validate the model compared to
other methods. So, I mean,

487
00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:56.720
there's definitely times that you
think like, Oh, that's a

488
00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:58.400
great idea. Wish I had
a thought of it. But

489
00:23:58.400 --> 00:23:59.540
even if you did, it
would still have been a

490
00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:02.270
lot of work to actually
implement it and prove that

491
00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:04.780
it works. Right. So It's
a good point because in

492
00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:07.450
the space of academia, you
can't just have the idea

493
00:24:07.450 --> 00:24:08.770
and write a blog post,
you have to have the

494
00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:12.460
idea and then write it.
Peer reviewed paper where 19

495
00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:17.200
of the pages are comparisons.
There's a lot of work

496
00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:20.530
to it's published paper. Yeah,
for sure. Does this, does

497
00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:22.600
this feel like the space
that you've chosen to live

498
00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:25.090
in the space of cloth
simulation? Does it feel like

499
00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:28.480
something that you'll ever it'll
never be done and it'll

500
00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:30.610
all be commoditized or will
there always be room to

501
00:24:30.610 --> 00:24:33.100
improve? I think there will
always be room to improve,

502
00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:36.760
especially with like new applications
in virtual reality or augmented

503
00:24:36.910 --> 00:24:41.590
reality, opening up where we
won like lower energy consumption.

504
00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:43.720
We have, the hardware is
not as good as computers,

505
00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:46.720
but we want everything in
real time. Visualized, you have

506
00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:50.320
to share the processes with
different part of different algorithms

507
00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:53.140
and stuff like that. So
there's definitely a lot of

508
00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:54.910
stuff that has to be
done before we're there. So

509
00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:57.970
it's going to take awhile
before we get that. There

510
00:24:57.970 --> 00:25:00.790
was an amazing thing that
I saw in a SIGGRAPH

511
00:25:00.790 --> 00:25:04.540
2008 papers. This is 10
years ago. Now that was

512
00:25:04.810 --> 00:25:09.070
simulating knitted cloth at the
yarn Level, which gets me

513
00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:11.800
thinking about my texture. Like
I sweater is a very,

514
00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:15.160
very different thing than like
a fleece. Yeah. That's, that's

515
00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:17.800
a really cool work and
that's from Stanford, I think.

516
00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:20.650
And there's, they're working on
it, working on more recent

517
00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:22.750
work on that too. So
that's very interesting to see

518
00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:25.090
how they can do like
actual yarns and how the

519
00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:28.420
individual yarns are colliding. Or
if you pull one, how

520
00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:30.730
it affects like the whole
structure. Yeah. It's definitely a

521
00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:33.700
very cool work. I think
it would be even interesting

522
00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:36.280
if you were doing a
movie and then in the

523
00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:38.620
movie, a piece of the
yarn gets pulled on and

524
00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:41.590
then how does it affect
the entire, the entire outfit?

525
00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:44.560
Like the yarn and their
simulations, at least in 2008

526
00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:47.980
was perfect, but when it's
not perfect, then things really

527
00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:51.670
good. Interesting. Yeah. Yeah. No,
it's, it's a definitely interesting.

528
00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:55.300
It also has applications in,
in more like the traditional

529
00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:58.900
industry. So such as like
the, you know, companies making

530
00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:02.080
knitted clothing, maybe they can
do virtual prototypes and get

531
00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:04.120
better understanding of what it
will look like. Or they

532
00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:07.090
can optimize over like material
user or however they're going

533
00:26:07.090 --> 00:26:09.640
to do their stitches so
they can do the way

534
00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:11.470
I understand that there's different
types of stitches you can

535
00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:13.330
do. So maybe they can
like, see like, Oh, I'm

536
00:26:13.330 --> 00:26:14.920
going to try this parent,
this parent. And they can

537
00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:16.840
get a really accurate visualization
of what it's going to

538
00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:18.610
look like and how it's
going to drape and move.

539
00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:21.220
So that would definitely speed
up their design process too.

540
00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:25.330
If someone is listening to
this podcast and they're thinking

541
00:26:25.330 --> 00:26:27.580
about either the game or
the thing that they're working

542
00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:29.440
on, or the movie that
they're working on in their,

543
00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:32.740
in their spare time, where
do they get started? They

544
00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:34.780
have to get a PhD
and read about this or

545
00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:37.090
do they go and get
something like Nvidia clothing or

546
00:26:37.090 --> 00:26:39.550
some off the shelf plugin
and start there when they're

547
00:26:39.550 --> 00:26:42.250
thinking of About how clothing
and cloth moves within their

548
00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:44.490
application? Well, they can get
the book and write their

549
00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:47.820
own simulator. Of course. Yeah.
But, but yeah, there's, there's

550
00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:51.690
a few simulators out there.
There's the more researchy math

551
00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:53.820
heavy where you can actually
get the code and then

552
00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:57.750
change the algorithm or you
can, there's a Nvidia physics

553
00:26:57.750 --> 00:27:00.090
or other solvers that you
can try and play with.

554
00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:03.270
Or the ones in the
game engines are 3d engines,

555
00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:06.600
such as Maya or blender.
Yeah. Those are all things

556
00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:08.520
that you can start like
open up and plug in

557
00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:12.560
and just start playing with
with the different settings. It

558
00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:14.750
seems like there's a lot
of source code online for

559
00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:17.630
this kind of stuff. Like
yes, people I'm sure keep

560
00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:21.230
them to themselves and, and,
and patent them, but it's

561
00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:23.840
a surprising amount of people
sharing their code and their

562
00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:27.170
algorithms Freely. Yeah. It's a,
it's a pretty open community.

563
00:27:27.170 --> 00:27:29.870
I would say. There's definitely
a lot of stuff to

564
00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:31.880
get started, but it's not,
of course not at the

565
00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:34.820
level of something that may
be a special effects studio,

566
00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:36.650
but use right. Cause they
have a lot, many years

567
00:27:36.650 --> 00:27:39.050
of in house knowledge, that's
built on top of that.

568
00:27:39.050 --> 00:27:41.840
But if you want to
get like an understanding of

569
00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:43.850
how these things work yet,
then there are the fee

570
00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:46.970
out there that you can
check out. And that definitely

571
00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:50.180
juxtaposes that different than if
the use case that doing

572
00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:54.020
offline rendering versus doing real
time game rendering on, on

573
00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:56.870
a, an over an off
the shelf machine, like my

574
00:27:56.870 --> 00:27:59.960
desktop machine or even on
a mobile device. I'm sure

575
00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:03.380
that's mobile cloth is an
entirely different way of thinking.

576
00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:07.280
Yeah. It's, it's definitely different
approaches to the same problem,

577
00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:09.440
depending on what what's most
important to you or your

578
00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:12.950
application, for sure. No, it's
not necessarily cloth, but I

579
00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:14.570
did want to point out
that you also did a

580
00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:19.040
paper on real time oil
painting on mobile hardware. How

581
00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:22.640
to like bring down a
digital oil painting system on

582
00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:26.600
something as resource constraint, as
an iPad. Yeah. That was

583
00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:29.120
a, it was an interesting
project. So the idea was

584
00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:31.940
that we can do oil
painting, but really accurate old

585
00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:34.370
painting. So we have actual
fluid simulations. We have different

586
00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:37.130
colors that would the pigments
that would mix in different

587
00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:39.440
ways, like in like the
way real color mixes, which

588
00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:41.660
is not the RGB way
that computers typically do it.

589
00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:44.360
So that the challenges that
were to get really accurate

590
00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:47.750
color models and then simulate
everything in real time. And

591
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:49.700
then it was interesting. Cause
I worked with a lot

592
00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:51.740
of artists and then I
got their feedback. So they

593
00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:54.380
were, they were brought into
the feedback loop very early

594
00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:56.720
on. So they would like
be like, Oh, this doesn't

595
00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:58.490
look real. This does look
real. This works well, this

596
00:28:58.490 --> 00:28:59.960
doesn't work well. So that
was a, yeah. That was

597
00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:02.900
a really fun project. Yeah.
That sounds so interesting. These

598
00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:05.900
are all examples where someone
can look at it negatively

599
00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:08.090
and think, Oh yeah. Well
how, how hard is that?

600
00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:10.760
But when you start thinking
about, you know, runny or

601
00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:14.510
diluted paint and having things,
having the stroke changed the

602
00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:17.180
paint and that stroke, you
have to have an infinite

603
00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:20.120
number of strokes and are
really long running painting. How

604
00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:22.850
do you optimize all those,
all those shots. Yeah. And

605
00:29:22.850 --> 00:29:25.250
then you want it running
on like some, the cheapest

606
00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:27.410
hardware you can get. Right.
So there's a definitely a

607
00:29:27.410 --> 00:29:29.270
lot of challenges that you
want to, you want to

608
00:29:29.270 --> 00:29:31.850
solve there. Yeah. It sounds
like it's a fun space

609
00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:34.040
and a space that you're
going to hopefully enjoy a

610
00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:37.850
very long career in. Yeah.
We'll see. Hopefully You can

611
00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:41.290
check out the book that
Torah stoke has written. I've

612
00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:44.020
got links in the show
notes. It is a short

613
00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:46.450
read, but a hundred pages,
but it is a great

614
00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:50.410
overview into the space. I'll
have show notes for all

615
00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:52.690
the things we talked about,
the different papers, the research

616
00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:54.190
papers, as well as a
place where you can buy

617
00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:57.670
the book. This has been
another episode of Hanselminutes and

618
00:29:57.670 --> 00:30:19.140
we'll see you again. <inaudible>.
