Scott talks with Mary Jo
Foley about windows seven and

8
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.950
the future of Microsoft. Hi,
this is Scott Hanselman and

9
00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.980
this is another episode of
Hansel minutes. I'm here today

10
00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.800
talking with Mary Jo Foley.
Mary Joe runs the all

11
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.250
about Microsoft blog for ZD
net. She has an unblinking

12
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.490
eye on Microsoft, and you've
been doing journalism around Microsoft

13
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.680
for a very long time.
Haven't you? Mary Jo. I

14
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.940
have Scott way too long.
Are you sick of looking

15
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.360
at just one company? No,
you guys are always a

16
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.050
fascinating company because every time
you think you've figured out

17
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.940
Microsoft and you've got it
all figured out and you

18
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.090
know what they're going to
do, they do something surprising.

19
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.820
Yeah. That project natal. Sure.
Surprised me. I didn't see

20
00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.210
that coming at all. Yeah,
really well. It's good. They

21
00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.940
can still surprise people who
work there. Well, it's, it's,

22
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.150
it's funny. I mean, there
were 80,000 people and when

23
00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.330
it's something like natal comes
out or they go on

24
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.660
Jimmy Fallon, I always get
a cousin or someone calling

25
00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.730
and saying, Oh my goodness,
why didn't you tell me?

26
00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.060
Like, I have no idea.
They don't tell us anything.

27
00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.950
I mean, I work for
the developer division. So, you

28
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.460
know, I think about developer
tools. I think that, you

29
00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.680
know, windows seven coming out
was just as exciting and

30
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.480
wonderful as anybody else did.
So, Yep. I was thinking

31
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.430
it was very exciting myself,
but it was funny. I

32
00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.290
was talking to somebody yesterday
and I said, you know,

33
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.480
even though I don't work
on the windows team, never

34
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.750
have worked for Microsoft. Whenever
a new version of windows

35
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.330
comes out. I still feel
kind of like I'm part

36
00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.310
of it in a way,
because I have to write

37
00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.620
about every little twist and
turn of windows. I mean,

38
00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.810
I've been writing about windows
seven for three years, so

39
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.570
it's like, wow, they did
it on the next thing,

40
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.300
you know? Yeah. I feel
like you should get your

41
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.390
little ship at a badge
or your, your, your piece

42
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.970
of clear plastic that you
put on your, on your

43
00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.200
fireplace. My non blue badge.
Yeah. Well, it's, it's, it's

44
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.970
interesting. I've worked at Microsoft
now. It'll be two years

45
00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.260
in September, October, somewhere in
there. And while I was

46
00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.340
in no way involved in
shipping window seven, I did

47
00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.090
file some bugs. And I
learned some really interesting things

48
00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.400
about how, how bugs work
is that if it's a

49
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.780
non, you know, interesting. And
I put that in quotes,

50
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.010
non-interesting bug like one, that's
not a huge deal. Then

51
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.350
you really have to kind
of be the advocate for

52
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.250
that bug. So I think
I filed maybe 10 or

53
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.420
15 bugs and I got
six or seven fixed. And

54
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.600
these are all kind of
mostly aesthetic things like, you

55
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.570
know, this icon is, is
ambiguous or, you know, when

56
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.910
you do this really obscure
thing to the start menu

57
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.460
on a Tuesday, then this
happens. But when it, when

58
00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.040
those bugs closed and you
can like search in the

59
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.370
bug database for Scott H
a and you go, you

60
00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.280
know, what did Scott ha
file? I feel like, Hey,

61
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.410
yeah, you know, I made
this a better product. So

62
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.900
I feel like if I
ever hear that someone did

63
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.760
that weird thing to the
start menu on a Tuesday,

64
00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.700
and it worked that I
had a tiny, tiny role

65
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.130
in that. And that was
a sense of pride. I

66
00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.200
didn't think that I would
get, cause I'm trying not

67
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.900
to be assimilated by the,
the big blue monster. Yeah.

68
00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.870
I mean, I have done
nothing like that. I mean,

69
00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.540
I, I get to play
with some of the test

70
00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.700
builds the windows seven, like
I got the beta and

71
00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.670
RC, but you know, I'm
not a techie, even though

72
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.830
I write about operating systems,
I kind of write from

73
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.820
a layperson's point of view.
So I still, I still

74
00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.400
was interested in seeing how
the whole process works and

75
00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.800
how that all happens and
how bugs get fixed or

76
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:21.360
don't, it's interesting. Yeah. The,
the, the triage process is

77
00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.590
really interesting. They, they put
a lot of thought into

78
00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.710
what the end user experience
is going to be. I

79
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.320
found some really obscure bug
when a certain printer was

80
00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.840
installed. When you, you know,
when a certain printer was

81
00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.120
plugged in, when you boot
it up, you know that

82
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.750
then your boot up would
be slower. And it was

83
00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.300
some obscure firmware driver. And
they had to think about,

84
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.860
well, how many of these
printers are out there? And

85
00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.970
what'll happen. It's really interesting
to me, because with, with

86
00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.620
like Apple products, you've got
a lot less hardware diversity,

87
00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.530
but with windows, man, you
don't know what anybody's running,

88
00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.310
you know, who knows what
random TV, you know, European

89
00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.370
TV card that they have
plugged in to some random

90
00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.220
mouse and it all has
to work together. Yeah. I

91
00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.410
mean, you know, that's a,
it's always kind of funny

92
00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.230
to me when people just
say, well, Apple's products work

93
00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.690
so much better together. And
like, why can't Microsoft do

94
00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.630
that? I'm like, well, if
Microsoft owned the NM process,

95
00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.720
they could too, but that's
not how it works. And

96
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.360
there's all these different parts
that come from different places,

97
00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.540
software, hardware, drivers is that,
I mean is a lot

98
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.280
of things to mix and
match and see if they

99
00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.060
all work. Now, you, you
just said something interesting. You

100
00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.530
said that you've been writing
about this from the point

101
00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.170
of view of a lay
person. So, I mean, you're

102
00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:37.050
not a programmer, you're not,
but we just think of

103
00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:38.790
yourself as a power user.
Would you think of yourself

104
00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:42.180
as kind of an average
Joe user or Jolene user?

105
00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.820
Oh, I, I think of
myself as a completely average

106
00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.520
user and other people who've
tried to help me fix

107
00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.440
things would agree. I'm sure.
It's funny. I know, I

108
00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:58.130
know about technology. I'm a
journalist by, and I've never

109
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.970
taken a computer science class
and you know, everything I've

110
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:05.480
learned about operating systems, I've
learned by writing and reporting

111
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.480
about them. So, you know,
just because I happen to

112
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.870
do that job, it doesn't
necessarily mean when people send

113
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:14.060
me something, I go, okay,
run such and such a

114
00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.430
script or do this. I'll
be like, okay, I don't

115
00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:18.140
know how to do that.
Sorry, you guys gotta help

116
00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.690
me here. And so I'm
no in no way of

117
00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:23.770
how are you, So you,
so you're experiencing it as

118
00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:27.130
you go, like where you
running betas of windows seven,

119
00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:30.010
did you experience it? And
as a user and say,

120
00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.370
wow, this feels different. Or
darn those drivers don't work.

121
00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:35.620
Were you having this happen
as it, as it happened?

122
00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.790
Well, you know, I, I
run as my day to

123
00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:44.290
day work machine windows, XP
on a ThinkPad. And that's

124
00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:46.510
what I've been running for
the past three years. And

125
00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:49.930
I still run that. Now,
the way I experienced windows

126
00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:53.200
seven was on a loaner
machine, a loaner sink pad,

127
00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:57.100
where I had the different
beta and RC builds installed

128
00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.350
there. So I get to
kind of go back and

129
00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:01.570
forth between the two and
try it out and see

130
00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:04.060
what was different. And I
have to admit when I

131
00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:06.820
put my first build of
windows seven, I was like,

132
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.280
yo, I don't know how
to do this because I

133
00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.580
haven't been using Vista. And
so it looked really different

134
00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:14.980
to me because I'm still
using the old XP look

135
00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:18.670
and feel. And it felt
like a big jump. But

136
00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.410
after I used it a
few times, I'm like, no,

137
00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:22.450
it's way more intuitive than
I thought it was. And

138
00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:24.430
it's not going to be
a, you know, a switch

139
00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:26.350
that people can't make. I
may, I mean, I feel

140
00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:28.570
like if I can do
it, so can they, Yeah.

141
00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:32.500
It's funny. I was talking
to our producer Lawrence before

142
00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.240
the show, while we were
waiting for you to call

143
00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:36.700
in and he said, yeah,
I hear the windows seven.

144
00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:38.410
Is that, what is it
like, is it got a

145
00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:40.990
lot of eye candy? And
I was like, wow, that's

146
00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:43.390
a really, that's a really
loaded question. I can date

147
00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:47.260
me. Is it prettier? Sure.
Is it prettier for no

148
00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:51.250
reason? No, I don't think
that's the case. No, I

149
00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:55.150
would say actually what I
liked about windows seven was

150
00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:57.340
it doesn't have a lot
of eye candy and it's

151
00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:01.990
kind of a stripped down
clean looking interface. And that

152
00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:05.020
appeals to me because I've,
I've actually tried to use

153
00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:08.410
the Mac operating system a
number of times. And I'm

154
00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:11.410
always ridiculed by Mac users
for not wanting to switch

155
00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:14.110
over to it because supposedly
it's so much more intuitive

156
00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:16.900
and more fun to use
and the better interface. But

157
00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:19.990
I feel like as someone
who's used windows all the

158
00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:22.630
time, I've used the computer.
It's not that intuitive to

159
00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:25.300
switch from windows to Mac
Mac to me is more

160
00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:29.230
eye candy. Interesting. I know
that I like the Mac

161
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:32.740
animations, you know, there's all
the windows were always running

162
00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:35.230
away like genies and stuff,
which I think is cool,

163
00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:39.010
but we have two max
at the house here. I've

164
00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:41.440
got a Mac which has
kinda like the kitchen recipe

165
00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.750
machine. It's a Mac mini,
and then we've got a

166
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:46.840
Mac pro, but you know,
I, people will say I'm

167
00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.990
a Microsoft shell, but I
just keep booting windows seven

168
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:52.330
on the thing. I just
say that, you know, forget

169
00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:54.160
about it. I'll just boot
windows seven. Cause it's a,

170
00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:58.440
it's a fine little seven
laptop. Now, one of the

171
00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:01.020
interesting things about windows seven,
that, that, that surprised me

172
00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:03.030
was that I'm running it
here. I'm looking at, I'm

173
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:06.720
sitting in front of four
monitors on a quad processor

174
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.390
machine with, I think I've
got either eight or 12

175
00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:11.820
gigs of Ram. I'm actually
got so much Ram I've

176
00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:14.970
forgotten how much Ram I
have. And next to me,

177
00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:18.480
over here, I've got a
tiny Dell mini with a

178
00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:21.360
gig of Ram and a
little tiny 16 gig hard

179
00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.450
drive. And it's the same
operating system it's working really

180
00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:27.990
well. Have you run it
on big machines and small

181
00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:30.950
machines? I haven't, I've only
tried it on the think

182
00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:32.840
pad, but you know, when,
when it comes out in

183
00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:36.530
October, I I'm really, really
interested in buying a copy

184
00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:40.460
of windows seven preloaded on
a netbook. And the reason

185
00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:43.580
I am is because I'm,
I'm probably like one of

186
00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:46.580
the stereotypical types who would
make a lot of use

187
00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:48.740
out of a notebook. You
know, I have, I have

188
00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:52.280
a regular machine at home.
That's my laptop everyday machine,

189
00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:54.950
but I want a machine
that can just grab, throw

190
00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:57.770
in my purse and go
cover a press conference. And

191
00:09:58.190 --> 00:09:59.960
my laptop right now is
a little big and a

192
00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:02.990
little heavy to do that.
So I'm like, wow, wouldn't

193
00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:05.660
that be cool to have
a really good operating system

194
00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:07.700
on a netbook and just
be able to take it

195
00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:10.190
and go and, and then
come back home and use

196
00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:13.130
my regular desktop. So a
little mix and match thing

197
00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:16.370
going on there. Yeah. This,
this talk of the, the

198
00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:20.550
Intel guys, the, the bosses
at Intel, the suits, the

199
00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.360
executive saying that Netflix really
aren't that useful. It seemed

200
00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:27.650
silly to me, the, my
love, my, my netbook, if

201
00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:29.540
it could get even a
little bit smaller with, I

202
00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:31.810
wish you could have a
foldout keyboard even. I mean,

203
00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:33.650
I was one of those
guys who used to sit

204
00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:37.730
on an airplane with a
Palm pilot and a foldout

205
00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:40.970
keyboard. Remember those little keyboards
that were like the size

206
00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:43.580
of a wallet, and then
you'd go and it would

207
00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:46.100
suddenly be a full sized
keyboard. You know, I'd sit

208
00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:48.350
there staring at this little
black and white screen trying

209
00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:51.980
to write like the great
American novel, just because, just

210
00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:54.620
because of the satisfaction, I
would get carrying an entire

211
00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:59.240
portable word processing system in
my back pocket. Yeah. I,

212
00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:01.070
I always feel like that
too. It's funny. Cause a

213
00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:02.540
lot of people say, Oh,
you don't really want a

214
00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:05.990
netbook. You want a full
fledged laptop. And I think

215
00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:11.060
there's kind of this disjointed
understanding about who really does

216
00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:12.890
want a netbook. Like people
are like, Oh, it's only

217
00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:15.650
low power users. And they
get really frustrated with the

218
00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:19.340
keyboard. They get really frustrated
with not enough memory for

219
00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:22.520
somebody like me, like a
quote information worker as I'm

220
00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:26.450
called in the, in the
way Microsoft categorizes people. I,

221
00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:28.700
a lot of days I
don't open a lot of

222
00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:32.780
apps. I might open like
say word and an email,

223
00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:35.270
a client and a browser.
And that's it for the

224
00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:37.730
whole day. Like I don't
use anything else. And so

225
00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:41.810
a netbook would be perfect
for that. Yeah. I run,

226
00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:43.880
I'm looking at my task
right here. I've got tweet

227
00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:49.580
deck. I've got a browser
chat, windows, Zune and outlook.

228
00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:54.880
So I don't know. What
is it? Six applications for

229
00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:58.180
some reason, the day of
having 20, 40 different applications

230
00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:01.180
running at the same time,
unless I'm actively developing, I

231
00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:06.240
don't find myself running a
thousand applications. Yeah. I mean,

232
00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:08.340
and you know, if all
you do is kind of

233
00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:11.880
what I do, which is
create and consume information, you

234
00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:13.920
don't really need a lot
of other apps. Like people

235
00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:15.810
are like, what about Photoshop?
I'm like, I've never used

236
00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:18.930
Photoshop in my life, you
know? Well, yeah, it's funny.

237
00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:21.270
I actually use a, I
use paint. I use a

238
00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:25.380
program called paint.net, which is
a little free application. It's

239
00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:28.650
almost like what you used
to need is built in

240
00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:31.590
now. So, you know, I
use Photoshop back in the

241
00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:33.750
day and then now I
don't have to buy Photoshop

242
00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:36.120
because I'm not a professional
designer. I'll use paint.net, which

243
00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.310
is free. And then, you
know, more and more, I'll

244
00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:42.120
just use the paintbrush that's
built into, into windows seven

245
00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:44.550
because it's got, it'll save
as PNG now and it'll

246
00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:46.710
do, it'll do the stuff
that I need so that

247
00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:49.770
the expectation of what comes
out of the box is,

248
00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:53.220
is greater. Like I noticed
that windows seven, my DVD,

249
00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:54.810
I remember the whole thing
with Vista. I think you

250
00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:57.450
probably covered this when DVDs
wouldn't play out of the

251
00:12:57.450 --> 00:12:59.160
box, you had to go
and get a Kodak or

252
00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:05.640
download something to make your,
your DVDs play. Now just

253
00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:09.240
even, even, even really complicated
codex on windows seven, work

254
00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:11.880
out of the box. I
didn't have to download any

255
00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:16.140
fancy Kodak. Of course, for
those folks that don't necessarily

256
00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:19.230
aren't native English speakers or
are, I think it's compressor

257
00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:21.480
decompressor. And these are the
files that allow you to

258
00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:27.570
watch various videos and windows
Vista didn't have some codex,

259
00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:31.650
I think, early on. And
I seem to remember maybe

260
00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:33.720
it was XP that you
had to download a DVD

261
00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:38.520
driver to get things working,
but I'm realizing that I

262
00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.770
may want to go and
pave my machine and it'll

263
00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:43.950
start from scratch with windows
seven, even though I'm running

264
00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:46.350
the release candidate back in
the day, I used to

265
00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:50.160
have to install 50 or
a hundred different applications to

266
00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:53.190
get a machine back. I'm
looking through my start menu

267
00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:56.250
here and I could probably
get a machine up and

268
00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:58.350
running in about four hours
and it would've taken me

269
00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:01.770
several days. Now, why don't
you run Vista? You said

270
00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:04.980
you're running XP on your
primary machine. Yeah. You know,

271
00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:08.850
I run a really kind
of low end thing pad.

272
00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:11.190
I've only got a gig
of Ram in the sling

273
00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:15.570
pad and I never upgraded
it back to the am

274
00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:19.170
I a power user? You
know? So everybody's like add

275
00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:21.510
more memory and I'm like,
yeah, I don't really think,

276
00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:26.370
I know everyone's like, Oh
brother, you know, come on.

277
00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:29.400
But yeah. So I've never
really tinkered with it. And

278
00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.530
you know, because I'm a
one person shop, I'm self

279
00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:34.800
employed, I'm a freelancer who's
self-employed and I don't have

280
00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:38.280
an it department. So I'm
always afraid if I really

281
00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:42.120
screw up my machine, I'm
really out of luck because

282
00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:44.190
I don't have anybody who
can go, okay, let me

283
00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:46.650
go back and, you know,
check your archives and do

284
00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:49.230
this and that. And Oh,
you did this or that

285
00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.350
to it. And that's why
it's not working. I have

286
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:53.480
somebody I can call on
like that. Other than, you

287
00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:55.400
know, my friends who are
in the tech community and

288
00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:57.110
a few of them have
said, they'd make a house

289
00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:59.600
call, but it's still, you
know, kind of, kind of

290
00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:02.150
scary to somebody who's like
an average user, like me

291
00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:05.090
to be tinkering with all
this stuff and moving to

292
00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:08.030
an operating system that I
know has higher requirements than

293
00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:11.330
possibly would be good on
this PC. So I've, I've

294
00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:13.270
just never done it. And
what kind of a thing

295
00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:15.430
that is it what's the
breadth of the model number.

296
00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:19.600
Oh yeah. You'll have no
trouble with that. I'm under

297
00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:23.950
seven. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not
afraid to try it with

298
00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:26.050
windows seven, but I was
more afraid to try it

299
00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:28.820
with Vista plus. Oh, I
see. Yeah. Well, that's, that's

300
00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:32.200
a very good reason. Yeah.
Also, you know, with, with,

301
00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:36.730
with Vista, I also, I
get to say when I

302
00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:38.500
also got a chance to
test that out as it

303
00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:41.830
was being developed and I
never liked a lot of

304
00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:44.740
things about it, you know,
the hibernation legs and the

305
00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:48.190
kind of all the UAC
prompts, which they've scaled back

306
00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:51.820
quite a bit in Vista
and windows seven. So I,

307
00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:54.190
I kind of felt like
I'm not really missing anything

308
00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:57.190
by not running Vista. I've
got a fully patched XP

309
00:15:57.190 --> 00:15:58.960
machine and I'm just going
to stick with that until

310
00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:02.860
windows seven comes. Right. Right,
right. Yeah. My I'm trying

311
00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:04.840
to get my wife. I
got in trouble early on

312
00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.330
in the windows seven cycle
because I upgraded her machine

313
00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:10.840
to windows seven beta without
asking. So I am no

314
00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:16.480
longer allowed to touch my
wife's computer. But yesterday when

315
00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:18.670
you know that release candidate
came out, reach candidate, we

316
00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:22.060
RTM brother released to manufacturing
yesterday. So I'm like, I'm

317
00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:24.430
so excited. I get to
introduce windows seven to my

318
00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:26.260
wife, and now there's a
family pack and I want

319
00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.810
to go get the family
pack. And I, you know,

320
00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:31.510
you know what you're getting
for, for Christmas, from me,

321
00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:35.650
I'm afraid is a copy
of windows seven. Well, that's

322
00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:38.080
not a big gift. I
don't think, I don't think

323
00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:40.030
so. Do you think now
as a, you've done a

324
00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:42.190
lot of analysis and you've
been watching all of this.

325
00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:44.620
I mean, is this a,
is this a winner for

326
00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:48.850
us? Is this gonna turn
things around for Microsoft? That's

327
00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:51.220
a, that's a big goal
there, but it's definitely a

328
00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:54.700
winner. I think it's really
great. I have to go

329
00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:57.010
with the analysts who say,
it's what Vista should have

330
00:16:57.010 --> 00:17:01.630
been. It really, it's very
solid. And it feels like,

331
00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:03.610
yeah, this is something you'd
want to try and not,

332
00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:06.940
not be afraid to, you
know, implemented multiple tens of

333
00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:10.510
thousands of seats across your
company. You know, there's a

334
00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:12.850
lot of other things Microsoft
has going on besides that,

335
00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.500
which make me scared to
say, it's going to turn

336
00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:16.480
all of Microsoft around, but
I think it's, I think

337
00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:20.260
it's really solid. And I
think it's, it was admirable

338
00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.360
that Microsoft did what they
said they do. They get

339
00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:26.680
it in, you know, in
to our TM within the

340
00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:30.010
window. They said, partners seem
to really like it. I

341
00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:32.680
talked to Dell and some
other OEMs Toshiba, and they

342
00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:35.800
really think it's pretty solid
and are committed to it.

343
00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:39.340
So those are all good
signs. That's good. That's good.

344
00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:42.340
Cause you get a pretty
wide, like you said, you

345
00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:44.860
work for yourself. So you're
completely objective in this sense.

346
00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:47.090
So you, you contract to
ZD net, is that, how

347
00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:51.630
has that works? So I
blog For ZD net and

348
00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:54.390
it's public information that the
way we get paid by

349
00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:57.150
ZD net is we get
paid by our traffic. So

350
00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:59.670
every time you click on
my blog, you are giving

351
00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:03.140
me a penny. I didn't
realize that's actually a pretty

352
00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:05.330
good system. Cause it's always
good to know who your

353
00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:08.960
journalists work for, to know
if there's any special interests

354
00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:12.620
or whatever that, so you
don't care. I mean, I

355
00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:14.600
suppose you would care if
Microsoft went away. Cause then

356
00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:17.030
you'd have to find another
company to focus on. But

357
00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:20.300
yeah, you're not invested in
Microsoft one way or the

358
00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:22.850
other. You're just reporting on
what's going on at Microsoft.

359
00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:27.560
Right. We even have a
pretty strict disclosure policy on

360
00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:30.260
ZD net where we have
to say if we have

361
00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:32.270
any kind of stake in
the company. So I own

362
00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:35.660
no Microsoft stock. So there's
no reason I'm doing insider

363
00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:37.460
trading or trying to make
the stock go up or

364
00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:40.340
down. And we have to
be pretty clear about, you

365
00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:42.320
know, do we take gifts?
Do we give them back?

366
00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:44.570
Or we were very strict
about all those kinds of

367
00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:46.610
things so that people don't
think we're on the take.

368
00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:50.420
Oh, that's cool. I didn't
realize that. That's that's interesting.

369
00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:53.210
Okay. So you said you've
been talking to the different

370
00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:56.510
Dell and the different OEMs
and it's looking like we're

371
00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:58.880
going to have machines in
the stores that are going

372
00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:01.100
to have windows seven on
them pretty pretty soon before

373
00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:06.950
October, middle of October. Yeah.
October 22nd is considered the day

374
00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:10.850
when retailers and the PC
makers can start actually selling

375
00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:14.000
machines with windows seven preloaded,
but people can get the

376
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.340
bits before that. If, if
they, if you're like an

377
00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:18.740
MSDN or a TechNet subscriber,
you'll be able to get

378
00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:22.340
them in August and volume.
Licensees can get them around

379
00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:25.250
September 1st. So, you know, people
start actually being able to

380
00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:28.970
get them before that big
launch date. Okay. I, you

381
00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:30.710
know, I have to say
as a, as a, not

382
00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:32.240
just as an employee, because
I've only been there two

383
00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:34.760
years, but as a person
who's, you know, gone through

384
00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:38.300
the whole 95, 98 windows
me 2000, the whole process,

385
00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:40.250
I thought it was pretty
awesome that we put it

386
00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:44.450
out on time. Yeah, yep.
That, that was good. That

387
00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:48.710
was very good. Still. I
think it's a joke. I

388
00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:50.330
thought a bunch of people
thought it was, it was

389
00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:54.980
a joke that we actually
finished it on time. Technically

390
00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:58.940
it's early, as I'm sure
people will point out, you

391
00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:00.680
know, for a long time,
Microsoft was saying, we're going

392
00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:03.800
to get it out by
the first part of 2010.

393
00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:06.620
And a lot of us
who covered the company were

394
00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:09.050
like, yeah, you're just giving
yourself, you know, the maximum

395
00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:11.120
windows, you know, you're going
to be on time if

396
00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:13.160
not early, but you know,
to get it out now

397
00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:16.220
and RTM this summer, it's
it's good. It's they did

398
00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:20.330
it. So that's good. Hey
everybody, this is Scott coming

399
00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:22.640
at you from another place
in time. No doubt. You'll

400
00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:25.130
probably bump into testing tasks
now, and then, and your

401
00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:27.980
work and, you know, writing
functional tests is probably not

402
00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:30.230
your favorite thing. It's kind
of difficult. It takes time

403
00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:32.720
and the results can be
dubious. Well, get ready to

404
00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:35.810
start liking tests. Thanks to
Tellerik with the, the new

405
00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:39.740
whereby testing framework building web
automation test is a breeze.

406
00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:43.510
You've got code automation with
advanced asp.net Ajax and several

407
00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:46.070
Lite applications. You can write
a single test, have it

408
00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:49.540
executed against multiple browsers at
once. You'd benefit from a

409
00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:52.990
rich API there's link support
integration with visual studio, unit

410
00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:56.890
testing, also end unit X
unit and MBE unit, not

411
00:20:56.890 --> 00:20:59.590
to mention the free rappers
for Telerik rad controls for

412
00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:02.890
ESPN and Ajax and several
lines, all shipping with Telerik's

413
00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:06.310
new testing tool. One of
the best features, the webinar

414
00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:09.430
testing framework, which is developed
by art of test is

415
00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:13.600
it's absolutely free. Freddie got
hooked on web testing framework,

416
00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:16.690
start using it right away,
go to tellerik.com for more

417
00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:20.800
info. Thanks a lot. So
if you want to get

418
00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:23.230
back on it, one other
thing, because the idea of

419
00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:24.970
you as a, as a
user, as a user of

420
00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:27.040
windows and as a, as
a journalist watching windows is

421
00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:30.610
interesting to me. You are
a independent, you have an

422
00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:32.890
XP machine, you have a
windows seven machine off to

423
00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:36.430
the side. You have no
it department to keep you

424
00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:39.640
in line. If you install
some driver. So if your

425
00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:43.630
machine's down, then you're in
trouble. You use windows home

426
00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:45.760
server. Cause I know you
blog about home server also.

427
00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:49.800
Here's another funny thing about
my weird existence. So I

428
00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:53.880
live in New York city and
I live in Manhattan. I

429
00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:57.420
have a very small apartment
because everyone in New York does,

430
00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:01.320
unless you're very wealthy. And
the home server guys at

431
00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:02.670
one point were like, you
want to get a home

432
00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:06.030
server and hook up all
your, you know, different PCs

433
00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:07.530
and have them all back
up to the home server.

434
00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:09.120
I'm like I have nowhere
to put a home server.

435
00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:14.310
Literally I could, all my
closet space is full. I

436
00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:16.430
mean, I have two closets
in my whole apartment and

437
00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:19.770
they're full. You're giving our
listeners quite the visualization. They're

438
00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:27.480
trying to figure out this.
Okay. Have you seen a

439
00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:29.400
home server? I'm looking at
a home server. It's the

440
00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:32.340
size of a dictionary. Surely
you can fit a dictionary

441
00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:35.910
in your apartment. The other
day was shopping for a

442
00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:38.700
blender and I didn't buy
it because I don't have

443
00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:45.180
a place to put it.
Wow. Spaces at an ultra

444
00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:51.540
premium here Because you don't
invest in Microsoft stock, then

445
00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:54.300
you would think you would
be rich. Yeah. I tell

446
00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:57.030
ya. The windows home server,
man, that was the operating

447
00:22:57.030 --> 00:22:59.220
system until windows seven. That
was the operating system. That

448
00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:02.670
was, they had me so
stoked. I actually funny windows

449
00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:05.700
home, home service story. When
we moved into this house

450
00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:08.370
here in Oregon, I needed
to get the yard done.

451
00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:10.800
And I was, we hired
the guy to come and

452
00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:14.730
put in the lawn and
to do some landscaping. And

453
00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:18.780
I'm, I'm, I'm a real
notoriously cheap individual. And I

454
00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:21.790
noticed that the guy had
his laptop and you know,

455
00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:23.220
you know, you know these
guys when you've got what

456
00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:25.050
you probably don't cause you
don't have a lawn. When

457
00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:27.120
you have a guy coming
to your yard, they might

458
00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:29.310
have a pickup truck and
then a laptop. And the

459
00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:31.920
laptop is probably from the
late seventies at some point.

460
00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:35.460
And it's been thrown into
the, you know, he just

461
00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:37.560
picks up and he throws
it onto the bench seats

462
00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:40.440
in his, in his, in
his pickup truck. And this

463
00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:43.500
thing was just beat to
hell. I hadn't seen a

464
00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:45.590
laptop as well, loved as
this thing. And I said,

465
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:48.080
wow, you do your entire
business on that laptop. And

466
00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:50.450
he's like, Oh yeah, man,
at that thing died. That

467
00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:52.880
is the only, that's my
entire business right there. You

468
00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:55.490
know? And I'm thinking to
myself, let me see. Meantime

469
00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:58.010
before failure of a hard
drive is five years and

470
00:23:58.010 --> 00:24:00.770
this guy has had this
thing for seven. He's literally

471
00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:04.100
on borrowed time, you know,
Murphy's law would indicate that

472
00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:07.070
next, the next day, my
lawn guy is going to

473
00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:10.550
have his business collapsed because
of his little laptop. So

474
00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:13.880
I said, I'll trade you
a windows home server. If

475
00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:16.370
you give me a thousand
dollars off of my lawn.

476
00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:19.610
So I went out and
to best buy and bought

477
00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:21.770
a windows home server. I
think it was like 500

478
00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:23.210
bucks. And I took it
over to his house and

479
00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:25.850
I set it up for
him and got his laptop

480
00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:29.750
backing up. And his wife's
machine, his kids machine, whole

481
00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:34.100
operation was like about three
hours, four hours. And, and

482
00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:37.190
then it's about four months
later he had a crash

483
00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:38.870
and he had the stuff
that he needed off of

484
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:43.010
his home server. So I
cannot the home, whether you

485
00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:45.440
use windows, home server or
something, you know, God back

486
00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:48.430
up your stuff, please. Yeah.
You know, the other reason

487
00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:51.400
I never took their offer
of trying out the home

488
00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:55.960
server was re you realistically,
I have one PC. I

489
00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:58.030
mean, I have all these
loaner machines that I'm always

490
00:24:58.030 --> 00:25:00.820
giving back and trading in
and getting a different loaner.

491
00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:03.070
But I mean, if, what
w what would I really

492
00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:05.740
back up to home server
except for my one machine?

493
00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:07.630
Well, so, so let me,
let me give you an

494
00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:11.710
example. I have effectively, well,
I have seven machines, but

495
00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:13.900
I have one machine effectively.
I have, you know, my

496
00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:18.340
primary machine and it had
160 gig hard drive. And

497
00:25:18.370 --> 00:25:22.090
I recently got an SSD,
right. A solid state disk.

498
00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:25.750
That was a 250 gig.
So how do I play

499
00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:29.890
with my new SSD while
still continuing to work? Well,

500
00:25:29.890 --> 00:25:33.460
my, my home server backs
up an image of the

501
00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:37.330
entire PC. The entire PC
is hard drive every single

502
00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:39.310
night at two in the
morning, it wakes up the

503
00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:41.290
laptop, backs it up, and
then it goes to sleep.

504
00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:44.650
So all I had to
do was remove the old

505
00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:46.420
hard drive, which is sitting
right here next to me,

506
00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:50.170
put the SSD in boot
off of a CD. It

507
00:25:50.170 --> 00:25:52.810
automatically connected to the windows
home server and said, Oh,

508
00:25:52.810 --> 00:25:54.850
this is your think pad.
Do you want me to

509
00:25:54.850 --> 00:25:58.720
restore? I click restore. Even
though I backed up a

510
00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:01.300
one 60 and I restored
it to a two 50,

511
00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:04.060
I was up and running
about four hours later and

512
00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:06.940
I'd restored my machine completely
booted off of it. And

513
00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:09.790
now I'm on the same
machine with a double, the

514
00:26:09.790 --> 00:26:11.680
size of a hard drive.
And it's an SSD. So

515
00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:14.050
it's twice as fast. What
I'm saying to you is

516
00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:18.220
that let's say you're a
single machine crashes tomorrow. How

517
00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:21.730
fast can you get back
up with a home server?

518
00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:24.010
You just buy a hard
drive and you restore from

519
00:26:24.010 --> 00:26:27.820
last night's backup and you
keep working. I'm saying you

520
00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:29.590
take a blender out of
the kitchen and make the

521
00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:33.960
window, Take my dictionary out
and trade it for home

522
00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:39.910
Sharice anymore. Mary Jo, it
must be a book. I

523
00:26:39.910 --> 00:26:43.380
actually, I actually recently speaking
of gadgets and devices bought

524
00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:46.770
a Kindle because I was
running out of room to

525
00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:48.990
get any more books and
I love to read. So

526
00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:51.300
I was like, wow, I
gotta, I gotta solve this

527
00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:52.980
problem. Cause I have no
more space for any more

528
00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:54.870
books. So I got a
Kindle and man, it's awesome.

529
00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:56.810
Do you have to give
the Kindle to, or the

530
00:26:56.810 --> 00:27:00.500
kennel DX? Yep. I get
the Kindle too. Okay. Now

531
00:27:00.530 --> 00:27:02.930
I actually love my Kindle.
I've talked about this on

532
00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:04.820
my blog. A number of
times that the Kindle is

533
00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:06.890
a joy. Although I'm going
to try to borrow a

534
00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:08.990
Kindle DX from somebody in
town. Cause I want to

535
00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:11.150
see what the larger one
is like. Now I get

536
00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:13.070
the New York times on my,
on my Kindle. Have you

537
00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:16.220
set that up too? No,
I just read the times

538
00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:18.680
on the web, so, Oh
yeah. That's the same thing.

539
00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:21.350
The, the, the, how many
books do you have in

540
00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:24.050
your Kindle? And have you
done the audio books? You

541
00:27:24.050 --> 00:27:27.860
know, I really have never
gotten into audio books. I

542
00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:30.800
really still like to read
visually. So I get my

543
00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:34.280
Kindle in, I think it
was around April or so.

544
00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:38.570
And I've read about 10
books on it so far

545
00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:41.480
because I've noticed I can
read way faster on the

546
00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:45.230
Kindle than I can paper.
And it's just so handy.

547
00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:47.000
Cause I travel a lot
to be able to just

548
00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.640
take everything with you. And
in this little tiny device,

549
00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:51.680
I get stopped everywhere. I
go in New York. People are

550
00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:55.220
like, is that a Kindle?
Wow, cool. Can I hold

551
00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:57.500
it? I feel like I
should get a commission on

552
00:27:57.500 --> 00:28:01.640
selling them. You just said
you read faster on a

553
00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:04.950
Kindle than a regular book.
How is that possible? I

554
00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:09.200
noticed I am finishing books
way faster. I think it's

555
00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:12.740
because I just keep a
finger on the next page

556
00:28:12.770 --> 00:28:14.900
button and I just, my
eyes just kind of go

557
00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:18.260
<inaudible> next page. Next page.
Next page. Next thing I

558
00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:19.760
know I'm done with the
book. So I don't know

559
00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:23.000
why. I wonder if, if
people are actually saving time,

560
00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:27.320
you know, crucial seconds that
they didn't get wasting paper.

561
00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:30.170
Yeah. It's I never thought
it would really make that

562
00:28:30.170 --> 00:28:31.700
much of a difference. I'm
like, Oh, what's the difference

563
00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:34.580
between turning a page versus
hitting a button, but you

564
00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:38.720
know, the type changes so
quickly and it's, I think

565
00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:41.150
it's very easy on the
eyes. I've been surprised how

566
00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:43.970
that's been too. So I've,
I'm reading a lot and

567
00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:46.880
I'm reading faster. Yeah. I,
I use my Kindle. I

568
00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:50.360
think that I'm reading faster
or reading more. I don't

569
00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:52.130
know about reading faster, but
I definitely know I'm reading

570
00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:55.880
more. I have the thing
with me all the time.

571
00:28:56.090 --> 00:28:59.330
I read more magazines. The
thing that I feel really

572
00:28:59.330 --> 00:29:03.350
the worst about is kind
of exactly the, the idea

573
00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:07.100
that this is a direct
link from Jeff Bezos into my

574
00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:10.490
wallet. So it makes it
so easy to give him

575
00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:13.340
money. We might as well
just deducted from my paycheck,

576
00:29:13.550 --> 00:29:15.590
but I feel bad because
I'll be at the airport,

577
00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:18.200
I'll go to a bookstore.
That's owned by some poor

578
00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:22.040
businessman. I'll flip through the
physical book and then I'll

579
00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:24.440
buy it on the Kindle
while I'm standing there. So

580
00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:27.260
Jeff Bezos is actually stealing money
from this man while I

581
00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:31.250
stand in his bookstore. Yeah,
I know. It's, it's kinda

582
00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:33.530
like the same thing with
music, you know, like how

583
00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:35.450
you, how you used to
be able to go to

584
00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:37.850
Virgin records, which are all
closed up in New York now.

585
00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:40.490
And you could like listen
to a CD or listen

586
00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:42.820
to new music and then
like go home and buy

587
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.970
the digital version. You know,
it's like, Oh, I'm kind

588
00:29:45.970 --> 00:29:47.860
of stealing in a way.
Cause I'm using them to

589
00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:50.880
preview. If I want something
or not. It is sad.

590
00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:53.310
Now this is a jagged
segue, but I wanted to

591
00:29:53.310 --> 00:29:55.440
make sure we talked about
this before, before I let

592
00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:57.960
you go. The Chrome chromo.
S what do you think

593
00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:01.380
about this? Well, you know,
I, I've been thinking a

594
00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:03.270
lot about it. Number one,
we don't know much about

595
00:30:03.270 --> 00:30:05.400
it. So it's kind of
hard to think about it.

596
00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.010
We don't really know what
it's gonna look like. How

597
00:30:08.010 --> 00:30:10.380
much is it really an
operating system versus a browser?

598
00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:14.700
How much is it Linux
versus not? But I was

599
00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:18.870
reading a really interesting speculative
piece by Michael Miller, you know,

600
00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:20.760
who used to be the
editor in chief of PC

601
00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:24.360
mag about it. And he
pointed out that, you know,

602
00:30:25.650 --> 00:30:29.820
Google never said this was
a PC operating system. And

603
00:30:29.910 --> 00:30:31.740
I, you know, everyone's saying
it's going to compete with

604
00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:34.350
windows and it's going to
be another, you know, thorn

605
00:30:34.350 --> 00:30:37.050
in Microsoft side. But what
if he's right and it's

606
00:30:37.050 --> 00:30:40.140
not really a PCOM and
it's just like a dedicated

607
00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:43.290
netbook OSTP, that's all it
is. You know? So is

608
00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:45.540
it really Mexico hit to
head with windows or is

609
00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:49.500
it just kind of like
a glitzier souped up browser?

610
00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:52.050
I think it's an interesting
question. And I'm really curious

611
00:30:52.050 --> 00:30:53.850
to see what it looks
like. That is an interesting

612
00:30:53.850 --> 00:30:55.950
question. I think that there's
ton of two sub questions

613
00:30:55.950 --> 00:30:59.010
there. One is support for
drivers, right? I mean, are

614
00:30:59.010 --> 00:31:01.800
they going to take Uber
Boone too, and then strip

615
00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:04.590
it down and put Chrome
browser on it? And then

616
00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:07.230
that, that would be a
general purpose PCO S but

617
00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:10.530
maybe they would block it.
So you couldn't install anything,

618
00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:14.850
which is a, basically an
appliance O S and then

619
00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:18.270
the second question is, well,
what about Boone too? I

620
00:31:18.270 --> 00:31:20.640
think that wound to, as
a, as a, as a

621
00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:25.860
Linux, desktop has such a
following and people who are

622
00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:29.460
into Linux enjoy it so
much that they might find

623
00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:31.860
that it was, it was
presumptuous of Google to go

624
00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:34.860
and think that they could
make their own, you know,

625
00:31:34.890 --> 00:31:38.760
to, to announce the chromo
S might offend Linux users

626
00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:43.440
who already liked their chosen,
their chosen operating system. But,

627
00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:45.870
but I think the really
interesting question is, are they

628
00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:50.670
presuming a fundamental shift in,
in, in the way that

629
00:31:50.670 --> 00:31:54.180
software is run like a,
who was it? Who said

630
00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:56.010
recently that they thought that
the app store was a

631
00:31:56.010 --> 00:31:58.770
bad idea? Yeah. A few
people have been saying that

632
00:31:58.770 --> 00:32:00.870
recently. Yeah. They're saying like
the death of the app

633
00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:02.940
store, like the app store
is a blip. The app

634
00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:05.310
store we're talking about is
the iPhone app store. The

635
00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:08.400
idea that you would go
to an, a store online

636
00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:12.750
purchase software for a specific
machine and bring it down

637
00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:15.360
it's it feels like Google.
And the folks that are

638
00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:19.710
betting on HTML five are
saying that this is a

639
00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:22.950
transitional period that we're in,
and that all software will

640
00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:27.210
be written in HTML five,
all purchase software will be,

641
00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:30.300
you know, something that you
you'd buy a subscription to,

642
00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:31.860
or you'd buy access to
it, but you'll end up

643
00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:34.350
running it in some kind
of a browser. It was

644
00:32:34.350 --> 00:32:36.000
the Palm guys. That's what
it was. It was the

645
00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.120
CEO of Palm and their
operating system on the Palm

646
00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:43.040
is basically the entire OSPF.
It's like a web browser.

647
00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:47.120
I don't know. I, I
think I understand the point

648
00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:50.630
of view that really my
netbook is a portable browser,

649
00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:53.420
but just when I think
that I need to run

650
00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:55.580
Excel or, you know, just
when I think that I

651
00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:59.290
run visual studio, so, Right,
exactly. Or you want to

652
00:32:59.290 --> 00:33:01.630
hook it up to a
printer, like that's, that's the

653
00:33:01.630 --> 00:33:04.060
other thing we don't know.
Can, can it print, can

654
00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:07.240
it work with any existing
peripherals like that? That kind

655
00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:09.940
of means it's not to
me if it can't, is

656
00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:13.930
it an operating system? Quote,
unquote at all? Yup. Yup.

657
00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:16.930
I have no idea. Yeah.
I'm going to be really

658
00:33:16.930 --> 00:33:20.050
curious to see what it
looks like Now, when I

659
00:33:20.050 --> 00:33:23.470
chatted you earlier, you were
asking about a thing called

660
00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:27.490
gestalt. Yes. I'm curious about
gestalt. I read about it

661
00:33:27.490 --> 00:33:31.150
on the mix online site,
and I was chatting with

662
00:33:31.150 --> 00:33:33.580
Jeff San Quist a little
bit about it, and I'm

663
00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:35.590
trying to think of a
way to explain it to

664
00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:40.570
a lay person because it's
supposedly meant to make developing

665
00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:43.120
easier. So I should be
able to explain it to

666
00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:47.350
a non programmer. Right. Okay.
That's a good question. So

667
00:33:47.890 --> 00:33:52.090
yes, I can. So in
the old days we wrote

668
00:33:52.090 --> 00:33:55.510
HTML and an HTML was
a declaration of what things

669
00:33:55.510 --> 00:33:58.450
should look like. And you'd
say, here's a table. Here's

670
00:33:58.450 --> 00:34:01.450
a picture. Isn't that nice.
And that was HTML. And

671
00:34:01.450 --> 00:34:05.950
it was good then JavaScript,
which was originally called live

672
00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:08.530
script and has nothing to
do with Java came along.

673
00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:12.220
And this, let us take
the description of what something

674
00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:16.300
should look like and add
a description of behavior. I

675
00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:19.210
can write a tiny program
in a tiny language, and

676
00:34:19.210 --> 00:34:22.720
it was also good. And
then JavaScript grew up and

677
00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:26.260
became a full fledged, powerful
object, trying to an engine.

678
00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:30.700
And then the JavaScript Wars
began and everyone wants faster

679
00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:33.220
and stronger and more wonderful.
But all the while there's

680
00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:35.320
a group of people who
just don't like this language,

681
00:34:35.350 --> 00:34:37.060
they just don't find it
to be the language that

682
00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:40.180
makes them happy. Everyone is
speaking Spanish and they want

683
00:34:40.180 --> 00:34:43.750
to speak Italian. They just
don't like it. So what,

684
00:34:44.470 --> 00:34:48.820
what gestalt is, is the
opportunity to plug in different

685
00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:52.240
languages that make you as
a developer happy. So from

686
00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:56.110
the point of view of
the lay person, nothing changes,

687
00:34:56.110 --> 00:34:59.410
web web webpages are fun,
and they look great. From

688
00:34:59.410 --> 00:35:01.600
the point of view of
the developer, sudden, suddenly someone

689
00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:04.450
has said, it's okay to
speak Italian. Don't worry, we'll

690
00:35:04.450 --> 00:35:07.600
speak English. You speak Spanish,
we'll speak Italian. You can

691
00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:11.380
use Ruby. You can use
Python and you can talk

692
00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:15.890
to your webpages. And as
well as JavaScript, it's, it's

693
00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:19.360
just a choice. And the
way it's done is with

694
00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:23.590
Silverlight, which is a plugin
like flash flash speaks one

695
00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:27.610
language, but Silverlight is a
general system that can speak

696
00:35:27.610 --> 00:35:31.150
any language. So it's conceivable
that other people could extend

697
00:35:31.150 --> 00:35:35.500
gestalt and make other languages
available. All of which just

698
00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:39.930
make developers happier. So It's
silver light inside of Gusto,

699
00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:43.100
or how does that work?
Ah, okay. So silver light

700
00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:49.940
is a general runtime. It's
a general engine that knows

701
00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:55.550
how to talk. It knows
how to speak.net and well,

702
00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:59.570
JavaScript engines know how to
speak JavaScript, like for example,

703
00:35:59.570 --> 00:36:04.610
Google Chrome and Firefox and
IE all speak JavaScript like

704
00:36:04.610 --> 00:36:07.310
with, I, I can point
I can show you the

705
00:36:07.310 --> 00:36:11.150
file on your disc that
says, that's JavaScript, it's called

706
00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:14.000
J script dot DLL. I
could point to it and

707
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:20.150
say, JavaScript lives there. Silverlight,
isn't a language. It's a,

708
00:36:20.210 --> 00:36:22.580
it's an environment. It's a
runtime. It's a place for

709
00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:25.220
a language to run in,
but it's not specific to

710
00:36:25.220 --> 00:36:29.510
any language. What gestalt is
doing is it's taking the

711
00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:33.980
language out of your HTML
page, handing it to Silverlight

712
00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:38.000
and saying, Hey, run this.
And because we have things

713
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.610
like iron, Ruby, and iron
Python, now we can run

714
00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:44.810
Python and Ruby from the,
from the browser. So we're

715
00:36:45.110 --> 00:36:47.180
in this case, you wouldn't
even need to see that

716
00:36:47.180 --> 00:36:50.060
Silverlight existed. You could make
a tiny one pixel by

717
00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:57.260
one pixel sized or invisible,
even a silver light instance.

718
00:36:57.290 --> 00:36:58.970
You know, you think of
flash and you think of

719
00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.400
showing, showing up at a
webpage and having flash take

720
00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:05.060
over the screen with something
like this. It's a little

721
00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:09.800
bit more subtle. The Silverlight
may not even show itself.

722
00:37:09.830 --> 00:37:13.730
It may be invisible, but
the developer is going to

723
00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:16.940
utilize that engine and say,
Oh, you've got silver light.

724
00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:18.830
Great. I want to speak
Ruby. And I'm going to

725
00:37:18.830 --> 00:37:21.470
hand it to you. As
I understand it from Jeff

726
00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:23.780
sandwich team, it's just, it's
a, it's a lab. It's

727
00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:27.080
a, it's a thing that
they've invented as a, as

728
00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:29.570
a, as an experiment to
see if it's possible. It's

729
00:37:29.570 --> 00:37:32.420
one of those things that
everyone has, everyone has a

730
00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:36.380
programmer has thought about, but
no one actually had the

731
00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:40.880
chutzpah to do it. And
Jeff's team just decided, you

732
00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:42.800
know, people need to do
this. So let's just try

733
00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:45.860
it and see what happens.
It's really an interesting idea.

734
00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:49.250
Yeah, it really is. I
didn't realize the silver Lake

735
00:37:49.250 --> 00:37:51.770
connection and that's, that's kind
of cool too. Yeah. So

736
00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:56.630
Silverlight is a generalized engine.
So, so like an example

737
00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:59.420
would be, you know, let's
say you're a Ruby programmer

738
00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:02.240
and you're writing a Ruby
code, but you really wish

739
00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:05.000
you could write Ruby code
in the browser. Then you

740
00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.270
could, you could do that
too. Hmm. Do you know

741
00:38:08.270 --> 00:38:11.120
anything about why they're con
why the code named gestalt?

742
00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:13.730
I haven't asked them. I'd
have to ask Jeff San

743
00:38:13.730 --> 00:38:17.390
Quist on, on Twitter, but
isn't the, the gestalt of

744
00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:21.230
something is the, just it's
the general, the general structure

745
00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:25.310
of something to get your
point across. So I would

746
00:38:25.310 --> 00:38:29.030
think that, well, I think
I would say that I

747
00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:30.860
think they are getting their
point across. They're using a

748
00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:33.050
different language to do it.
They could have called the

749
00:38:33.050 --> 00:38:36.730
thing project, get your point
across, but that would use

750
00:38:36.730 --> 00:38:38.530
English, which is a language
we're already using. So why

751
00:38:38.530 --> 00:38:42.010
not say it in German
and say project gestalt, they

752
00:38:42.010 --> 00:38:45.700
got their point across of
the different language, which is

753
00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:48.960
exactly what your Stolt does.
Very interesting. I have a

754
00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:50.700
question for you. Can I
throw one out to you?

755
00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:54.450
Okay. The interview is over.
Yes. This is an easy

756
00:38:54.450 --> 00:38:56.640
one because, cause I I've
been asking a lot of

757
00:38:56.640 --> 00:39:00.600
people who are using windows
seven and the responses have

758
00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:04.020
been very mixed. What do
you think of touching windows

759
00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:06.360
seven? Like, are you a
big touch fan touch on

760
00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:09.390
a laptop and touch on
a PC? I mean, I

761
00:39:09.390 --> 00:39:12.300
understand why people like touch
on a phone and why

762
00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:14.340
some might even want it
on a Kindle, but what

763
00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:18.300
about on a laptop? I
was one of the tablet

764
00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:22.080
people early on. And so,
you know, I definitely get

765
00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:25.680
that. The problem is that,
you know, my phone is

766
00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:30.450
greasy. It's just, it's disgusting.
And I sure don't want

767
00:39:30.450 --> 00:39:35.640
anyone touching my screen. I'm
less interested in touch in

768
00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:38.340
the physicality of it and
more interested in the gesture

769
00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:40.950
aspect of things. It's not
the fact that I actually

770
00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:43.860
have to physically touch my
screen to move that window.

771
00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:46.890
It's the fact that maybe
in a couple of years,

772
00:39:46.890 --> 00:39:48.930
I won't have to touch
the screen at all. I'm

773
00:39:48.930 --> 00:39:50.910
looking at three or four
monitors in front of me

774
00:39:50.910 --> 00:39:53.610
here. Here's my browser at
my right hand. I would

775
00:39:53.610 --> 00:39:56.310
like to just gesture, flipping
my hand to the left.

776
00:39:56.910 --> 00:39:59.520
And I want that browser
to, to kind of move

777
00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:03.600
over to the middle window.
The middle monitor. That's the

778
00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:06.060
promise of touch for me
is not having to touch

779
00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:09.960
anymore. I don't think it's
about touch. I think it's

780
00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:13.410
about gestures. Yeah, that's cool.
Cause I, I'm not a

781
00:40:13.410 --> 00:40:15.780
big touch advocate. I never
really liked the tablet. I

782
00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:17.670
just couldn't get used to
that. As much as I,

783
00:40:17.970 --> 00:40:20.580
I actually still take my
notes by hand on paper.

784
00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:23.370
Cause I can write faster
than I can type even,

785
00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:28.470
but I I'm always kind
of puzzled over the touch

786
00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:30.090
thing cause I'm like, well,
who wants to go and

787
00:40:30.090 --> 00:40:32.310
like be touching their laptop.
I just don't see why

788
00:40:32.310 --> 00:40:33.600
you would want to do
that when you've got the

789
00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:36.150
mouse, you get, you know,
a lot of other ways.

790
00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:38.640
I mean, people say it's
not meant to replace the

791
00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:40.830
mouse, but still it feels
weird to me. Like I

792
00:40:40.830 --> 00:40:43.350
don't want to go touch
my leg. Yeah. I think

793
00:40:43.350 --> 00:40:45.840
you have the right, the
right perspective. If you touch

794
00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:48.840
your laptop in the sense
that if you're pretending that

795
00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:51.540
your finger is a mouse,
your finger like the finger

796
00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:55.380
as pointing device, I think
is a mistake. You're not

797
00:40:55.380 --> 00:40:57.450
going to be able to
click the minimize button with

798
00:40:57.450 --> 00:40:59.640
the tip of your finger
faster than you can with

799
00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:02.070
a mouse. But if, if
you could just make a

800
00:41:02.070 --> 00:41:05.040
gesture and just flip downward
with your finger, I could

801
00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:07.230
see myself sitting on a
plane with a, with a

802
00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:09.930
machine having, you know, one
hand on the mouse, one

803
00:41:09.930 --> 00:41:11.550
hand on the keyboard and
then maybe lift my hand

804
00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:15.300
up and just swipe downward
to close a window or

805
00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:18.150
to minimize a window. Yes,
it would be very handy

806
00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:21.510
in a small space. Like
my apartment where my keyboard

807
00:41:23.250 --> 00:41:25.770
on my little desk, Any
elbow room at all. Are

808
00:41:25.770 --> 00:41:28.050
you able to lift your
arms in your apartment? You

809
00:41:28.050 --> 00:41:29.550
know, I used to live
in Seattle and I had,

810
00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:31.860
I had, I rented a
four bedroom house when I

811
00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:34.220
lived in Seattle and now
I in one room, literally,

812
00:41:34.270 --> 00:41:38.180
literally some people say this
is progress. Some do not.

813
00:41:38.590 --> 00:41:40.600
We need to have you
rescued when we're going to

814
00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:42.640
send someone to your house
and we're going to have

815
00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:46.540
you lowered from the window
because this is really concerning.

816
00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:51.820
Well, thanks so much, Mary
Jo Foley for talking to
