<inaudible>. Hi, this is Scott

8
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.500
Hanselman. This is another episode
of Hansel minutes today. I'm

9
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.950
talking with Kesha Joseph's. She
is getting her PhD in

10
00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.950
linguistics and already has an
ma in linguistics and is

11
00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.440
also a software developer. Thanks
for talking with me today.

12
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.170
Hi, thank you. So you
are getting your, you said

13
00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.170
your ABD, but you're really
like you're doing your dissertation

14
00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.100
right now as we speak
probably, right. Yeah, I am.

15
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.530
I'm very close to finishing.
I can feel it in

16
00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.280
my bones. I just have
one left and then a

17
00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.440
whole bunch of editing to
do before I finished. So

18
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.800
hopefully I finish by this
semester, if not by the

19
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.740
end of this year. Excellent.
And then will you make

20
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.590
everyone call you dr. Joseph's?
You know, I think I

21
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.130
will. I I've been, I've
been actually running that through

22
00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.260
my head. I have another
friend who is a woman

23
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.850
of color who has a
PhD, and she gets, she

24
00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.030
talks a lot about how
she gets more respect when

25
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.420
people call her doctor. So
as a woman of color.

26
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.770
So I think maybe it's
gonna feel weird. You spent

27
00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.110
decades in school. I think
that you can, I'll call

28
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.880
you whatever you tell me
to call you. I respect

29
00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.210
that 100% as a person
that went to community college.

30
00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.640
You know, you can just
call me Scott. I have

31
00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.670
a lot of respect for
people who put that much

32
00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.980
work into school. Thank you.
So additionally, you are Afro

33
00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.030
Caribbean specifically, is it colonography?
Yeah, I'm Afro Caribbean and

34
00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.700
colon Naga, which is a
native American tribe. That's in

35
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.780
the Caribbean. The biggest community
is in Dominika. There's a

36
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.720
reservation there. So there is
a native American reservation in

37
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.680
the Caribbean. It's on the
Island of Dominica, about 4,000.

38
00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.370
I had the numbers about
2000, 4,000 individuals, and then

39
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.120
there are other smaller communities
throughout the Caribbean, like Saint Lucia,

40
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.300
which is where my mom's
from and where my community,

41
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.900
my clinical community is though.
I work a lot with

42
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.770
the community and Domenica, and
there's like, there's a lot

43
00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.640
more going on in the
Caribbean, culturally and linguistically. And

44
00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.910
there's more islands, I think,
than most, most Americans realize,

45
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.280
right? They think Puerto Rico.
And then as you go

46
00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.070
to the East, maybe they,
once they get to us

47
00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.800
Virgin islands, they kind of
just forget that there's a

48
00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:03.450
dozen other islands with culture
beyond there. Yeah. The Caribbean

49
00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.350
is incredibly diverse. And what
I'm learning through my work

50
00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.200
is that it has, who
has been, or almost always

51
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.150
been incredibly an incredibly diverse
and rich place in culture,

52
00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.680
in language and traditions, you
know, in the Martin times

53
00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.280
that since they were colonized
by different countries and you

54
00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.440
can go from one Island
to the next and have,

55
00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.980
you know, different accent to
different culture. And historically there's

56
00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.950
been a lot of native
American tribes that have passed

57
00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.660
through there and have put
their own touches on each

58
00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.570
one of those places. So
it's really fascinating. And I

59
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.380
think that that history does
not get talked about a

60
00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:53.430
lot, especially the indigenous side
of the Caribbean history. And

61
00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.010
when we talk a lot
about Caribs and Arawaks, and

62
00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.060
every time I read something,
I'm like, Oh, they got

63
00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.140
it wrong because it's so
it's so much broader and

64
00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.310
it's so much wider than
what you would read about

65
00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.000
in the books. Right? So
you'd hear Columbus came in

66
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.860
and he said, he found
the tiny nose and the

67
00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.870
tiny nose said, Hey, via
these bad people called the

68
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.360
Caribs. And that was that.
And then they all died

69
00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.360
out and it really wasn't.
There, there was a lot

70
00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.300
of trade going on between
the groups there's even some

71
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.610
connections to North American native
groups. So it's, it's, it's

72
00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.000
a really fascinating place. It
is. And it, it does

73
00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.820
so easily get, you know,
people just kind of draw

74
00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.580
a circle around it in
their mind and they, they

75
00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.170
say that that's the Caribbean,
you know, and that's it.

76
00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.680
And, you know, flipping it
to the exact opposite side

77
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.330
of the globe, you can
see why people would be

78
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.780
frustrated with like marijuana, which
was just this kind of

79
00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.770
generic Polynesian thing. It was
a great movie and beautiful

80
00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.620
songs, but from a cultural
perspective, it was just a

81
00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.610
mush. Yeah. Yeah. It's really
interesting that you mentioned that

82
00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.130
because I have one of
my friends who is Maori

83
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.680
and she, she lives in
New York and has, you know,

84
00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.560
three kids now. And it
was a big thing in

85
00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.170
her kids' school. And she
has managed to turn that

86
00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:12.810
movie into so many teaching
moments. I just told her

87
00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.630
that the other day. So
now, you know, the kids

88
00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.800
love the movie, but they're
also getting the like real

89
00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.390
input from Marie individuals of
cultural items. So they just

90
00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:27.630
had like a, a party,
but they had like real

91
00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:33.270
Polynesian dancers that came and
shared authentic Polynesian dance. So

92
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.980
I'm like, how cool is
that? You know, you're like

93
00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.200
eight years old and you
hit a mall in a

94
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:42.690
party with like an authentic
Polynesian dancers and have access

95
00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.110
to all these people that
you can actually ask about.

96
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:48.930
So ask about, you know,
the, the culture and tradition.

97
00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:52.590
So that was, that was
really great. That's great. And

98
00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:54.600
that's great. That's the, that's
the time to get it.

99
00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.830
I mean, my kids are
nine and 11 and this,

100
00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.620
that movie and reading about
things like that will give

101
00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.340
them a realization that life
is a lot more complicated

102
00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.400
and varied than people realize
putting people into boxes doesn't

103
00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.420
do anyone any good. Yeah.
And, and it was, it

104
00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:13.180
was interesting to see how
she struggled with it because

105
00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:14.830
she knew all the things
that were wrong with the

106
00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:17.650
movie, but she knew that
the kids were coming from

107
00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:22.060
a very innocent place. So
she was able to use

108
00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.460
that, to Educate them on
some of that, The, the

109
00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:29.710
culture is in history. So
yeah. So, Well, sure that

110
00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:32.590
you're focused on the colonoscopy,
that is both a language

111
00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:33.970
and the name of a
culture. I want to make

112
00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:36.490
sure I get that right.
So the group is <inaudible>

113
00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:38.530
and the name is of
the languages. I'll tell Kala,

114
00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:41.470
and I'll go, and this
that's what the community uses,

115
00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:44.890
but you might also have
heard of Caribs. So we

116
00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:47.770
have been called Caribs for
a very long time, and

117
00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:53.080
it's just a very erroneous
term because, so what happened

118
00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.140
in the Caribbean is that
there were Arawak and peoples

119
00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:59.110
throughout there that came first.
And then there was a

120
00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:02.140
wave of Kara peoples that
came and there was a

121
00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:07.300
lot of intermarriage between the
two. And when Columbus came

122
00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:10.600
since the Caribs were the
ones that were putting up

123
00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:12.640
a lot of the resistance,
of course, they heard from

124
00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.430
the Arawaks that, Hey, this
guy's coming in and he's

125
00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:19.900
doing bad stuff, put up
a fight. So he basically

126
00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:22.840
said, okay, it's the Caribs
that are the problem. We've

127
00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:25.390
got to fight them. And
all these people that I

128
00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:28.690
don't like are now Caribs.
And so the name kind

129
00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:31.810
of stuck, and it just
causes so many problems. It's

130
00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.680
it's like, no, well, we
have some Caribs, even though

131
00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.810
we have some care words
and we have some carob

132
00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:41.470
heritage, but it's just like
saying, you know, English has

133
00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:44.110
some French words, but we're,
you know, If you're English,

134
00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:47.350
you're not French, you know?
So it's, it's sort of

135
00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:50.020
that sort of deal. So
Colin algo is the best

136
00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:55.330
term to use. The language
is spoken, was spoken by

137
00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.190
how many people and is
spoken by how many people

138
00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:03.070
now It was spoken throughout
the Caribbean. And you know,

139
00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:06.310
if you want to say
a million people, thousands of

140
00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:10.900
people, and it is now
spoken by no one. So

141
00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:16.060
that, that language loss, our
last fluent speaker said that

142
00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:18.610
she died, her name was
Maga stove, and she died

143
00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:22.510
in the 1920s. And since
then, yeah, there are people

144
00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:25.180
who remember bits of the
language. There were remembers of

145
00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:29.140
the language. But since then,
there have no been no

146
00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:33.910
fluent speakers of the collar
Noggle language. So if this

147
00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:35.830
is, if this is what
we call, and I hope

148
00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:39.490
this isn't offensive, a dead,
a dead language, is it,

149
00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:42.880
is it something that is
just like many dead things

150
00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.860
will just be forgotten? Or
how do you, how do

151
00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:46.330
you bring it back? And
when you do bring it

152
00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:47.740
back, how do you make
sure that you brought it

153
00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:51.340
back authentically? And that you're
not, you haven't evolved it

154
00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:53.800
in a direction that doesn't
make it the language anymore.

155
00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:58.080
That's a good question. And
in the linguistic or language

156
00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:03.210
revitalization community, there's this idea
that you don't call a

157
00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:07.560
language dead. You call it
dormant. I understand when people

158
00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:10.350
say that a language is
dead or that it's extinct.

159
00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:15.480
And so when someone says
that it doesn't really cause

160
00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:20.580
me any offense, but the
reason why people, some people

161
00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:23.880
prefer the term dormant is
that there's idea that this

162
00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:26.430
language could be brought back.
So if you think of

163
00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:31.860
something like Latin, that was
considered a, you know, a

164
00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:37.140
dead language or even Hebrew.
So Hebrew was actually not

165
00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:41.790
spoken at one time. It
was, you know, completely gone

166
00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:46.110
and people brought it back
to now, it's a language

167
00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:50.070
of an entire nation. So
is the idea that, well,

168
00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:51.810
if it said language is
dead, then it can't be

169
00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:56.010
come back, but these languages
came back. So you can

170
00:09:56.010 --> 00:10:00.660
call that a dormant, but
in regards to the other

171
00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:03.450
part of the question, so
how do you, how do

172
00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:06.540
you make sure that you're,
you're getting it right? Basically.

173
00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:11.040
So what I do is
first of all, we have

174
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:14.070
a lot of documentation on
our language. So we have

175
00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:17.040
a dictionary from 1665 who
was written. It was written

176
00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:22.140
by a French priest called
father Raymond rotten. And he

177
00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:25.890
recorded a lot of the
language, not just words, but

178
00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:28.230
he recorded a lot of
phrases, a lot of cultural

179
00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:32.850
information. And there are also
other people who went back

180
00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:36.600
to the Caribbean and gotten
various language information at different

181
00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:40.050
points in time. So we
have snapshots of the language

182
00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:44.880
at different points in time.
And so we have a

183
00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:48.060
grammar from 1889. We have
a linguist that went back

184
00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:52.860
from, from 1930s on, and
we also have languages that

185
00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:56.160
are related to ours that
are still spoken. So there's

186
00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.850
Airwalk and South America and
gutter for not in central

187
00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:04.170
America. Our language has also
slightly related to why you,

188
00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:07.770
which also has a lot
of speakers I'm in Columbia.

189
00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:13.470
So I can use those
languages and compare them to

190
00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:18.390
my language colonoscopy and through
linguistics, historical linguistics, you could

191
00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:22.680
see regular sound changes to
see what this might be

192
00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:29.670
in my language. So for
example, in gutter, finna the

193
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:32.040
word for like the bow
of a, a bow and

194
00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:38.070
arrow is Gamara and in
Kala, NAGO at Shimada. So

195
00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:41.040
where Griffin has tends to
have geese, we tend to

196
00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:44.460
have sheep. So if I
see a word in gutter

197
00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:48.210
for now, that's has that
geese sounds. I know where

198
00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:50.100
to look for in the
dictionary. If it's not there,

199
00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:52.320
then I can safely say,
Hey, it probably would have

200
00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:55.150
been, she because we don't
have geese in our language.

201
00:11:55.870 --> 00:12:01.120
So that's, that's a little
bit of, of way the

202
00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:04.060
way I do it. And
in terms of, you know,

203
00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:08.230
authenticity, I think that's, that's
something that's asked a lot

204
00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:11.770
of indigenous people that we
somehow have to be more

205
00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:15.610
authentic in order to be
accepted. And it's not something

206
00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:20.590
that's asked of other people.
So I don't know your

207
00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:26.470
heritage, Scott, but are you
an authentic person because you

208
00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:28.960
do not. Do you speak
the language of your ancestors

209
00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:30.670
or do you dress in
that sort of way? Are

210
00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:34.320
you getting it right? You
know, Good point. So that's

211
00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.960
very interesting that you brought
that up because, so I

212
00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:40.650
said kind of getting it
right. And that's, and by

213
00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:43.230
that I meant like, are
we sure we're speaking at

214
00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:46.050
the way they spoke at
200 years ago and then,

215
00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:49.790
and you then use the
word authentic, which is a

216
00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:54.960
valid paraphrasing of what I
said. That's interesting. I didn't

217
00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:59.610
realize the implications of asking
that. Yeah. It's something that

218
00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:04.530
isn't meant to be a
threatening or pressuring thing. It's

219
00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:06.510
meant to be a, like,
if I was going to

220
00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:09.420
start speaking middle English, I
don't know if I'd be

221
00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:10.980
speaking at the way they
actually spoke it. Cause there's

222
00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:13.740
no recordings. But then if
let's say, let's say that

223
00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:16.230
we all started speaking middle
English and it became the

224
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:19.530
new middle English cares if
it was, if we pronounced

225
00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:21.330
it right or not, it
doesn't make us less authentic

226
00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:23.970
is what I'm hearing you
say. Yeah, exactly. And the

227
00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:27.150
one, the, a language that
doesn't change is truly dead.

228
00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:32.400
So language is constantly changing.
And so if your, if

229
00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:35.190
your language is one that
doesn't change, it means you

230
00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:38.460
probably don't have any speakers.
So what I try to

231
00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:41.550
do in my work is
definitely if it's recorded, try

232
00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:45.420
and use that, but also
realize that it's, it's, it's

233
00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:48.150
not going to be what
was spoken in 60 65.

234
00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:50.760
It's it's just not, we
don't have all that information

235
00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:54.120
and you have to be
comfortable with that. But then

236
00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:57.210
again, I don't speak English.
Like we spoke in 1665.

237
00:13:57.210 --> 00:13:59.730
I definitely tone. Although I
think it's beautiful the way

238
00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:03.510
it was spoken then, but
I don't. And we're okay

239
00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:07.950
with that. So I think
that, and a lot of

240
00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:13.470
communities, native American communities struggle
with that. So I think

241
00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:15.810
that's, that's one thing that
they have to understand is

242
00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:21.870
that it's not about getting
it Right or wrong, Just

243
00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:26.160
doing the work and getting
it spoken. And that once

244
00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:29.940
it's spoken as a natural
language, those languages Changes will

245
00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:34.440
evolve over time. Interesting. So
then the more people who

246
00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:37.380
start speaking this, it will,
I mean, you'll be chatting

247
00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:39.900
with someone in Colorado, you'll
hear the way they pronounce

248
00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:42.450
something. It'll feel better or
feel right in your mouth.

249
00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:45.270
And you'll either consciously or
subconsciously pick it up. And

250
00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:47.340
then more people will start
to say that, that way.

251
00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:50.520
And it grows over years,
presumably. Yeah. And that's a

252
00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:55.460
pretty good about language change
in general. So an interesting

253
00:14:55.610 --> 00:15:01.460
language change, for example, I
remember when I was younger

254
00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:05.780
of a lot of when,
when Valley Valley speak started

255
00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:09.620
to get popular, especially up
talking, like when you ask

256
00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:12.020
a question where you ask,
say something, and it sounds

257
00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:15.820
like a question That was
my time as well. And

258
00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:20.710
I remember it being restricted
only to frisk Only if

259
00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:24.190
restricted to, it seems like
white people, white girls in

260
00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:28.930
particular. And now it has
exploded to, that's just a

261
00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:32.530
way a lot of young
people talk, little boys included.

262
00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:35.530
I've heard little boys talk
like that. No, my, my

263
00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:37.990
little boys, my little black
boys talk that way. Right.

264
00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:41.260
And so it's just, it's
a change that happens within

265
00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:46.720
our lifetime. We could actually
see. So that's a good

266
00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:49.060
example. And when you said
that, of course, the first

267
00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:51.460
thing my brain went to
is like stop trying to

268
00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:56.890
make fetch happen. Right, right.
So you can see those

269
00:15:56.890 --> 00:15:59.170
little sound chases. And I,
and I love seeing those

270
00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:01.540
things. I know they probably
annoy a lot of people,

271
00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:04.210
but when I see those
things happening, I'm like, Oh,

272
00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:09.340
cool. It does bring up
an interesting thing though, because

273
00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:15.700
you, you mentioned that using
Valley speak, there are, you

274
00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:19.660
know, it was originally kind
of like from a, the

275
00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:22.180
ethos of it is around
white girls in the Bay,

276
00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:24.580
you know, rather than, Oh,
in the OSI rather, but

277
00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:27.490
you, you know, put black
folks that grew up in

278
00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:29.620
the OSI talk like that
too. You know, it just

279
00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:31.330
depends on where you grew
up and where you came

280
00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:33.430
from. And then you hear
people in New York or someone

281
00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:36.760
like me from Portland can,
can pick that, that style

282
00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:40.090
of talk up, is it
a pro? So then pivoting,

283
00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:44.380
when is it appropriate to,
for, for someone like me

284
00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:48.100
to study or learn about
colonography and when is, when

285
00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:53.770
does appreciation become appropriation Big
in this talk of appropriation?

286
00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:57.940
We have to, I remember
that Get talked about is

287
00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:03.130
that there's a power dynamic
in appropriation. And so it's

288
00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:07.420
not just, Hey, if you
learn my language, you're appropriating

289
00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:11.530
it. It's If you learn
that The language and then

290
00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:15.760
you decide, Hey, you know,
maybe I want to copyright

291
00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:18.400
this and use it for
my brand. And then you

292
00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:22.660
spread it around and you
have that power to completely

293
00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:25.930
change your meaning that a
colonoscopy person doesn't that's when

294
00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:29.110
I think it becomes the
level of preparation. So that's

295
00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:32.560
where you get into the
field of native American mascots

296
00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:36.100
and, and where they're appropriating
because they have millions and

297
00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:40.180
millions of dollars to redefine
what that native American is.

298
00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:44.950
The native American image is,
and that's appropriation. Yeah. And

299
00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:49.500
so I wanted to learn
colonoscopy, I'd say fine. I'd

300
00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:51.930
probably want to make sure
that the community's needs are

301
00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:55.430
taken first. So taken care
of first. So my, my

302
00:17:55.440 --> 00:18:00.420
thing is creating, creating language
materials for the community. That's,

303
00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:03.480
that's more accessible for them.
And then the community gets

304
00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:05.970
to decide whether they want
to open it up or

305
00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:10.230
not. And then you can
go from there. But I

306
00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:13.020
wouldn't say if you just
have right now with like,

307
00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:14.970
Hey, can I learn Colin
ago? I'm not going to

308
00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:17.670
say, Oh my gosh, you're
appropriating. Cause I don't think,

309
00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:20.960
I don't think that it
is. I think that the

310
00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:23.000
example of copywriting is a
really good one. I was

311
00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.530
thinking about the, the Tesla
company and how they named

312
00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:30.020
their company Tesla. And they
didn't have to ask the

313
00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:34.730
Tesla family or Nicola Teslas.
They took over his name,

314
00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:37.700
paid nothing for it. Right.
So if I decided to

315
00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:39.530
make a new electric car
and I called it, the

316
00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:43.520
Colonnade go, you know, and
then, then, you know, a

317
00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:46.850
year later I become famous,
popular. I have just completely

318
00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:49.340
appropriate to the name of
something without paying anyone and

319
00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:52.310
turned it into a thing
that is not the original

320
00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:55.250
thing. That is a great,
great example that you had

321
00:18:55.250 --> 00:19:00.200
there. Right? And the other
point about putting the, the

322
00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:03.260
tools to learn a language
in the hands and in

323
00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:05.330
the form of the people
who need it, the most,

324
00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:08.270
for example, my wife speaks
in Dibeli, which is like

325
00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:11.510
a Zulu or bond to
language. I, when I learn

326
00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:15.800
it, I am reading the,
the, the, how I, there's

327
00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:18.020
not a lot of like,
Hey, white folks learn Zulu,

328
00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:20.630
you know, like docs, there's
no books on that. So

329
00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:23.300
I'm reading the books that
she learned from, you know

330
00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:26.240
what I mean? Because those
are the books where that,

331
00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:30.050
where that was needed. So
in what form do you

332
00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:32.690
put the, the, you know,
things to teach colonoscopy? Is

333
00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:35.120
it multimedia? Is it books?
Is it, is it, is

334
00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:37.370
it an app for their
phones? Is it paper? How

335
00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:41.780
do you teach this? So
what I'm working on? So

336
00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:46.760
in the Caribbean, getting internet
was really hard in the

337
00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:49.760
past. I'm getting high speed.
Internet was really hard when

338
00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:54.170
I went there in 2011,
I remember having to, we

339
00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:56.930
had to park outside this
tourist bar drive like a

340
00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:59.180
couple minutes to park outside
this tourist bar to get

341
00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:04.010
like, to hijack their free
wifi. So it really wasn't

342
00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:07.880
accessible. And, and then away
a lot of the way

343
00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:10.130
a lot of people get
things on their phone is

344
00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:14.200
through credits through their phone
company. So they buy a

345
00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:18.170
card for 20 credits, $20
credits, and they use that

346
00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:21.290
until, and you know, it,
it gets used up. So

347
00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:25.700
I definitely want to make
sure that things that they

348
00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:28.880
can use are, do, won't
take a lot of bandwidth.

349
00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:32.810
For example, won't take a
lot of their data will

350
00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:35.660
be easily accessible through phones
because that's the way most

351
00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:41.480
people connect to the internet
is through phones. So I

352
00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:44.360
was trying to think and
think, and think about just

353
00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:49.000
ways that I can distribute
this material. And finally, I

354
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.700
mean, this happened really recently.
I thought that probably the

355
00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:55.030
best way would be to
distribute it by an ebook,

356
00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:59.590
because that way he gets
a small download it's made

357
00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:03.130
for mobile devices. You can
put multimedia in it, if

358
00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:05.680
you want it doesn't have
to play. And so it's

359
00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:08.980
something that's small. Won't take
a lot of bandwidth, but

360
00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:13.630
still is mobile friendly. So
I'm working on that right

361
00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:17.760
now. Interesting. That's a good
idea. I saw that there

362
00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:20.040
were some people, I think
his name was dr. Martin

363
00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:23.430
Benjamin working on a thing
called the Kamasi project. K

364
00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:26.130
M U S I, he
wanted to make a Swahili

365
00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:29.790
to English dictionary available to
feature phones and did it

366
00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:32.400
with texting. So when people
hear a word, they don't

367
00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:35.940
understand, they can text the
phonetic sounds of what they

368
00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:38.790
heard and then it will
text back the word in

369
00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:40.800
their language. So they have
basically have an English Swahili

370
00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:44.780
dictionary over texting's so you
could potentially expand a feature.

371
00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:48.990
Yeah. That, that sounds really
cool. Actually, it's a really

372
00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:52.530
cool idea. So is that
the Hi, that's the kind

373
00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:54.390
of things to think about,
like you can't just say,

374
00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:56.730
yeah, we'll make this great
multimedia app or have all

375
00:21:56.730 --> 00:21:59.670
these videos and everything. That's
not necessarily the way that

376
00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:02.160
they need. Right. Yeah. You
know, and most of, most

377
00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:05.190
of the devices are Android.
If, if any, I mean,

378
00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:06.930
just a couple of years
ago, people were still using

379
00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:11.010
blackberries. So they were, they
were really popular there. So

380
00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:13.920
it's not like I could
just make this cool iOS

381
00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:16.200
app and have everybody use
it because they don't have,

382
00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:19.650
they didn't have access to
that. And it's really expensive.

383
00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:21.900
So it was those sorts
of things that I have

384
00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:25.710
to think about. But essentially
I, I think of mobile

385
00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:28.860
first, something that's small and
easily accessible and mobile phones

386
00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:32.970
and then expand from there.
So then let's say that

387
00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:35.880
we get, you know, is
this taught in schools? You

388
00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:37.950
know, how many years, until
you can say that it

389
00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:41.790
is now not a dormant
language, do you have colonoscopy

390
00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:44.400
tables where people are getting
together and chatting, you know,

391
00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:46.440
how much time do you
spend speaking it? So you

392
00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:52.230
don't forget. So I think
the way a language becomes

393
00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:56.190
living or the way Language
lives, it's through children. So

394
00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:59.550
if you have a hundred
adults speaking a language and

395
00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:03.540
there are no children learning
it, your languages is dead,

396
00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:07.350
essentially it's on its way
out. So what you need

397
00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:11.400
is to raise children in
the language. And so what,

398
00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:14.550
what needs to happen is
we need a carnival baby

399
00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:18.510
to be raised fluently in
Collin algo. And that's, that's

400
00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:20.430
probably won't happen for a
while. I mean, I'll do

401
00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:24.180
it with my own future
kids if that happens. But

402
00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:30.570
until that happens, then that
language can't be living or

403
00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:34.560
awake, but it's getting there.
It's getting there. And what

404
00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:37.860
I think needs to happen
is, so we have a

405
00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:43.740
lot of language materials that
are across different languages. So

406
00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:47.090
I'm working with materials that
were in like Kala, nego,

407
00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:49.610
French dictionary. And then I
have a call Nagus Spanish

408
00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:54.080
translation, and then there's some,
or walk Dutch, you know,

409
00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:57.140
dictionaries. And so I'm working
with all these languages and

410
00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:59.870
I love, you know, I
love learning languages, but it

411
00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:03.920
does make things very slow.
It does make getting material

412
00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:06.260
out very slow because for
us to have to translate

413
00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:08.720
things and then I have
to cross check the translation

414
00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:10.370
and then I have to
compare it with the related

415
00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:13.880
language though. It's a lot
for one person. So what

416
00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:16.880
I'm hoping is that I
can get more collagen members

417
00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:20.510
or more members from the
indigenous Caribbean community too, to

418
00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:26.120
help out more with getting
these language documentation accessible to

419
00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:30.020
other people. And then we
can start to create curriculum

420
00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:34.430
and materials and classes and
language tables for them. And

421
00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:36.110
a lot of it is
just, you know, plain old

422
00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:39.500
financial support. So I'm trying
to go to the Caribbean

423
00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:41.990
this, this year, but it's,
it's a bit expensive getting

424
00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:45.470
to Dominika. They don't have
a international airport and you

425
00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:48.380
can only fly there during
the day. Cause you sort

426
00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:50.840
of come in through these
two mountains and it's too

427
00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:55.310
dangerous to fly in at
night. And so it's very

428
00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:58.220
hard to get into a
very hard country to get

429
00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:00.650
into, but it's beautiful. If
you ever have a chance

430
00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:02.750
to visit, I'd definitely recommend
it. It's it's called the

431
00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:06.680
nature islands because it's not
very heavily touristy Island. So

432
00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:09.860
there's a lot of just
lush green rainforest is a

433
00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:14.990
huge hiking trail, little volcano.
Like it's just, it's just

434
00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:19.610
gorgeous. Isn't that where boiling
Lake is? I believe so.

435
00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:23.830
And Trafalgar falls if I
recall, I mean, there's a

436
00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:28.510
lot of waterfalls. There's a
lot of little Springs. There's

437
00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:33.070
I mean, it's, it's just
a gorgeous, gorgeous Island. Let

438
00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:36.340
me ask you this. How,
how big are these different

439
00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:40.150
languages? Like I know that
English is rather a viral

440
00:25:40.150 --> 00:25:44.890
language. It steals very much
and it consumes other things,

441
00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:48.430
you know, there's, I think
we're something like two or

442
00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:53.470
3 million words right now, but
the average person's vocabulary is

443
00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:55.540
what, somewhere between 50 and
a hundred thousand on a

444
00:25:55.540 --> 00:26:00.280
daily basis. But there are
other languages that are smaller.

445
00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:02.680
Like again, using the languages
I'm familiar with like my

446
00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:05.770
wife's, my wife's language is
language. They maybe only have

447
00:26:05.770 --> 00:26:09.920
15, 20,000 words total, and
then they borrow. Right. Right,

448
00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:12.250
right. So for example, they
don't have a word for

449
00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:16.750
phone, they just say foreigner.
So they would take, give

450
00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:20.980
me the phone. Is that
right? Is a foreigner, is

451
00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:22.810
that phone well, yeah, they've
made it that where they,

452
00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:24.760
they, they stole it just
like we stole every, all

453
00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:28.120
of our languages. So how
many words is colonoscopy? How

454
00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:30.730
many are lone words and
how many would you need

455
00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:33.280
to know to consider yourself
fairly fluent and then be

456
00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:36.130
able to use it in
your day to day? So

457
00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:40.300
color Noggle historically. So in
the region there's the there's

458
00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:45.060
Originally was the French. So
we do actually some French

459
00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:49.410
words, but most of the
language, Oh, I see the

460
00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:53.610
two main linguistic inputs to
the column Nongo language. So

461
00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:55.890
overall it's an Airwalk and
language languages from the Arawak

462
00:26:55.890 --> 00:27:00.660
in stock. And then there
are words from carob. So

463
00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:04.380
there, and there's not a
lot recorded. So we probably

464
00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:10.110
have about, I'd say about
4,000 words recorded and in

465
00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:14.190
terms of making new things,
so different languages have different

466
00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:18.030
strategies to making new words.
So some languages like English

467
00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:22.380
borrowed, just, just take the
word and maybe change the

468
00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:27.660
pronunciation a little bit in
some languages have different ways

469
00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:32.010
that you can describe what's
happening or describe the item.

470
00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:35.940
So for something like, so
when I wanted to talk

471
00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:41.730
about internet, I made a
colonoscopy word, Tikkun, chippy, which

472
00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:46.020
means fast net. And so
I can use things I

473
00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:50.460
can use descriptions of what
the item is and make

474
00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:55.440
a new word without having
to say something like knitter

475
00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:58.590
net or something like that,
you know, which is kinda

476
00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:00.950
weird. No, it is weird.
It reminds me of when

477
00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:04.070
I went to Japan and
we went to get hamburgers

478
00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:07.670
at <inaudible>. Yeah. So yeah,
it's kinda like that. How

479
00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:09.770
long ago we don't like
consonant clusters, so we tend

480
00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:14.540
to put continents in there.
And, but what I try

481
00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:17.810
to do is first, see
if we can make a

482
00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:22.040
word from it. If it's
just too difficult that I'd

483
00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:23.900
go to a related language,
see if they have a

484
00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:28.400
word there, if that doesn't
work, then go wider until

485
00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:31.970
the last resort. It was
just borrowing it wholesale from

486
00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:35.450
English. That's the thing that's
interesting though. Cause that is

487
00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:38.540
almost cultural though, because English
doesn't feel bad at all

488
00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:41.930
about borrowing from other words,
well, you know, the French,

489
00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:45.920
well, the French are maybe
more protective of their language

490
00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:48.650
and they, they don't like,
you know, weekday, you know,

491
00:28:48.650 --> 00:28:51.200
they prefer it to be
something that, you know, something

492
00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:54.230
different than a weekend, you
know, they, so that idea

493
00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:57.530
of protectionism around your, your
language definitely makes sense. Especially

494
00:28:57.530 --> 00:28:59.810
when there are so few
people speaking it and then

495
00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:03.290
with a smaller vocabulary, it
makes sense also to combine

496
00:29:03.290 --> 00:29:07.580
them like German into longer,
almost sentence like words, Right.

497
00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:10.340
And colonoscopy is like that.
It's a very, so we,

498
00:29:10.890 --> 00:29:13.610
we start our sentences with
verbs and you can do

499
00:29:13.610 --> 00:29:16.280
a whole bunch of things
with verb. So it's, it's

500
00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:20.060
easy to make things or
describe things and use verbs.

501
00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:22.940
We have, we have a
good process for doing that.

502
00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:28.550
So when in doubt, that's
what I do. Cool. So

503
00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:32.420
people can find you on
Twitter at iHeart Lang L

504
00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:36.320
a N G and where
are some resources? I sure

505
00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:38.240
they can go and Google
for colonoscopy, but where could

506
00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:40.790
they go and learn about
your work? Maybe read about

507
00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:47.400
your and possibly donate. Oh,
I have a website it's

508
00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:50.820
K M Joseph's dot get
held at IO and I'll

509
00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:53.370
put some stuff up on
there where they can go

510
00:29:53.370 --> 00:29:57.210
and find some, some resources
there. I don't have any

511
00:29:57.630 --> 00:30:00.360
at the time I'm working
on, on the website, but

512
00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:03.750
I'm working on a lot
of websites. So as my

513
00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:08.580
mom would say, the cobbler
has the worst shoes. Absolutely.

514
00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:12.120
Maybe you could do me
the pleasure of the kindness

515
00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:15.570
of ha rather than me
doing my thank you so

516
00:30:15.570 --> 00:30:17.790
much for joining us today.
And thank you for listening.

517
00:30:17.790 --> 00:30:23.730
You could exit us in
colonoscopy. Oh wow. I will

518
00:30:23.730 --> 00:30:27.900
say her home. Thank you.
And that's about it. Thank

519
00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:31.170
you so much. I appreciate
it. This has been another

520
00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:34.140
episode of Hanselminutes and we'll
see you again next week.
