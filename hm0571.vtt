<inaudible>. Hi, this is Scott

8
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.140
Hanselman. This is another episode
of Hansel minutes today. I'm

9
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.410
talking with Jennifer gentlemen. She's
a software engineer on the

10
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.090
windows team. How are you?
Hey, Scott. Excellent. I'm a

11
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.250
pretty happy to be talking
to you because people don't

12
00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.070
realize this, but even though
of course, they know that

13
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.800
I, I worked for Microsoft
at least currently, as of

14
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.780
the time that we are
recording this show. And I,

15
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.690
and even though this show
is not like technically a

16
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:17.150
Microsoft specific show, I think
of it as nondenominational people

17
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.940
don't realize that like my
division, which is the developer

18
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.030
division, like I don't necessarily
hang out with y'all like,

19
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.810
I don't know anything about
your universe of the windows.

20
00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:34.370
Is it w WDG a
windows devices, group something I

21
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.700
hate. Yeah, I don't know,
but it's, it's when that

22
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.920
the windows like division the
whole universe vice group. So

23
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.470
yeah, so our, our groups
are very different because it's

24
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.070
150 million people in the company.
So you have your own

25
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.380
engineering systems, you have your
own feedback systems. We share

26
00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.600
some stuff. Like I assume
you build with our products.

27
00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.160
You guys have been doing
awesome stuff recently. I will

28
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.810
take full credit for that,
even though I had nothing

29
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.510
to do with it as,
as you should. Oh, of

30
00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.230
course, absolutely. I'm standing on
the shoulders of giants, but

31
00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:11.330
the thing that you do
that is cool and what

32
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.220
I think we've all noticed,
and I'm speaking by the

33
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.810
way, I want to make
sure people understand I'm speaking

34
00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.760
as the enthusiastic user of
windows, as opposed to the

35
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.420
like, person that knows anything
about windows from the inside.

36
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.300
Because I don't like have
the code for windows. I

37
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.170
don't, there's a lot of
code. There's a ton of

38
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.030
code. You're really listening to
feedback more than ever before.

39
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.220
And like the whole insider's
thing, like those builds, those

40
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.290
are like the same builds
that people have internally, right?

41
00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.960
Like I'm a windows insider.
So I get, what does

42
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.230
it call it? The fast
ring You can get fostering

43
00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.800
slurring or the release preview
ring as a windows insider.

44
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.490
And the fast ring is
like a show. Like, what

45
00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.880
is it a build every
week or so more, or,

46
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.310
yeah. And, and obviously when
you get builds that fast,

47
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.310
they can have more issues,
but they're also more on

48
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.810
the frontline of cool features
and improvements. Whereas slow is

49
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.560
like, I want the cool
stuff, but I do want

50
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.560
to have a level more
stability before I get it.

51
00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.250
And then release preview is
actually you get cumulative updates

52
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.140
before production or some of
the cumulative updates before production.

53
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.190
Yeah. So those are the
three rings that we have

54
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.710
right now. Okay. And are
those like special or different

55
00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:36.150
or they are just the
same. They come out of

56
00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.670
the windows build server. Like
I know that internally I

57
00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.940
have access to a folder
that's called like wind builds

58
00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.790
and I can install windows
from that are the ones

59
00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.760
that the insiders get the
same as that. Yep. That's

60
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.610
the same. I mean, I
think we're fighting out of

61
00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.890
RS to underscore release right
now as of the latest,

62
00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.570
fast builds, but effectively yes,
I get the builds you

63
00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.360
get the builds is the
same builds. Isn't that kind

64
00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.370
of like a big culture
shift that seems to me

65
00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.250
like there must've taken that
must've been at the highest

66
00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.760
levels. They were making a
decision like that, that, Oh,

67
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.960
let's just give people the
bills that we've been giving

68
00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:18.030
ourselves internally. It's pretty cool.
I mean, we definitely, we

69
00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.930
did beta programs, I think
in the past, but by

70
00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.110
the time people got the
builds, the feedback we were

71
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.340
getting, it was really good
feedback, but it wasn't like

72
00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.350
we didn't really have an
easy way to keep track

73
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.140
of it all. And a
lot of stuff had changed

74
00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.740
by the time we were
receiving the feedback and because

75
00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.160
the fast ring is so
fast, like we really can,

76
00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:47.460
you know, iterate on our
features as soon as they

77
00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.860
get the builds and they
start telling us what they

78
00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.460
want. So that's, that's kind
of like, I don't know

79
00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.040
if this is a thing,
feedback, driven development. I mean,

80
00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.310
the very first thing any
of my team members asked

81
00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.320
me when we, we fly
to new feature is like,

82
00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.540
what did they say? Did
they like it? Like how

83
00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.810
they react? And like I
share screenshots from Twitter and

84
00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.290
read it. And like, and
we, we look at, you

85
00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:12.750
know, we have these little
popups, which are like, what

86
00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.260
did you think about the
new start experience? And like,

87
00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.150
we'll look at how the
ratings are and we can

88
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.490
filter it by like, who
gave us a wan, like

89
00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:25.560
it's rubbish. And we're like,
no, why? Yeah. So, So

90
00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.380
humans like to be here,
like they did that. I

91
00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.690
want a, what am I
on now? I'm on insider

92
00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:34.620
fast, 1531 as of the
recording of this show and

93
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:38.430
what was I doing something?
And then it was kind

94
00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.530
of creepy, but also kind
of comforting because it was

95
00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.000
like, were you able to
find what you needed or

96
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.950
whatever? And I was like,
wow, like, how did you

97
00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:48.150
know what I was doing?
It notices stuff. So like,

98
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.280
it'll see you use the
action center. And then it'll

99
00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.500
say, what'd you think about
the action center? You're saying

100
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:57.740
actual humans have actual meetings
and screenshots of our on

101
00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.030
Reddit or whatever do get
in front of humans. Yeah.

102
00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:05.890
Most of us. So I
am one of the shell

103
00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:09.580
community champs, but they're actually,
there are, there's at least

104
00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.010
one for each team. There's
a few of the teams

105
00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:14.590
that have more than one.
And a lot of us

106
00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:18.460
send weekly or biweekly reports
sharing all the top feedback.

107
00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:22.450
What's trending. What's kind of
died down what went out

108
00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:28.060
in last flight. Yeah. We're
very feedback driven. So you

109
00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:33.790
said you're a shell engineer's
shell, meaning Explorer exe and

110
00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:37.390
the start menu, or what
is the shell? So in

111
00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:42.550
WDG the two big or
there's the core team and

112
00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:45.520
there's the shell team and
the core kind of works

113
00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.910
on all of the, the
platform level API is, and

114
00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:52.690
then the shell builds the
UI or user interface on

115
00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:58.540
top of that. So my
specific team owns the start,

116
00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:01.990
many of the taskbar action
center, virtual desktops, all that

117
00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:05.260
kind of stuff actually file
Explorer is also owned by

118
00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:10.630
shell, but it's a different
team than mine, but yeah,

119
00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:12.520
it's a lot of fun.
I'm a very visual person.

120
00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:16.960
So the shell team made
sense for me. And the,

121
00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:19.270
the feedback that you get
when I go to the

122
00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:22.570
feedback app, like there's this
little app that you run,

123
00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:24.760
that is an, all of
the things is called the

124
00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:28.630
feedback hub. I recently figured
out and tell me if

125
00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:31.060
I figured this out correctly,
it's actually way more sophisticated

126
00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:33.160
than we thought. Like I
thought it was basically just

127
00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:37.720
use your voice. And it
has a lot more, yeah,

128
00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.250
what's going on in there
because I realized when I

129
00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.560
go and say, add more
feedback, it's really sending logs

130
00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:42.760
and doing a bunch of
stuff that I did not

131
00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:46.540
realize it was doing. Yeah.
We've really tried to make,

132
00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:50.650
like when we started user
voice was one of the

133
00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:54.160
main places of feedback, but
we, we, we deprecated that

134
00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.950
and shifted to the, the
feedback hub. And we've really

135
00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:58.390
been trying to make it
a lot more of a

136
00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:04.420
sophisticated system for keeping track
of feedback. And part of

137
00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:07.870
that is like, you could
add screenshots, if you can

138
00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:12.820
consistently reproach an issue, you
can actually add monitoring and

139
00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.370
you can go through the
steps that cause you to

140
00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:19.660
get into that state. We
were able to see, like

141
00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:23.050
when was the feedback? What,
what build number was the

142
00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:26.380
feedback first log for a,
what bill does it still

143
00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:31.060
getting feedback on how many
different tracking VSO items there

144
00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:34.810
are for that feedback? Cause
obviously you can imagine, like

145
00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:38.320
when you have feedback, like
the start menu, isn't reliable,

146
00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:43.690
it's not just one reliability
issue. I mean, you could

147
00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:47.290
have a variety of things
that impact reliability on the

148
00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:50.890
system. And then we're able
to link multiple items to

149
00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:57.840
that. And, and actually recently
we, so in the backend,

150
00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:03.120
we've always tracked feedback in
groups and that's just because,

151
00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.850
I mean, feedback, we get
it from every different language.

152
00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:10.920
So kind of inherently, if,
if you have feedback across

153
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.570
a bunch of different languages,
it's all the same. You

154
00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:16.080
need a way to group
it all together. Sometimes people

155
00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:20.820
also log feedback. I mean,
some, one person will log

156
00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:23.790
feedback. Someone else will log
the same feedback. Maybe they

157
00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:25.830
didn't see it. Maybe they
want us to still know

158
00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:29.100
that it's an issue. So
we track feedback in groups.

159
00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:34.590
And recently we made that
visible on the front end

160
00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:37.710
to which are called collections.
And that's where I come

161
00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:45.120
in. And I'm like, people
really want support for the

162
00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:49.470
lunar calendar in the task
bar. And I publish that

163
00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:51.210
as a group, but now
you can kind of track

164
00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:55.200
the entire entity as opposed
to all the individual little

165
00:09:55.200 --> 00:10:00.120
ones. The feedback hub team
is also very interested in

166
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:04.230
responding to feedback kind of
appropriately and it's to help

167
00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:07.430
kind of reduce duplicates. How
do you do that in

168
00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:09.530
multiple, multiple languages though? Like
you said, that people want

169
00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:11.240
this calendar, but like what
if they're saying it in

170
00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:18.860
French? So feedback on our
end is all automatically machine

171
00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:26.690
translated. We can see the
original language, but when we

172
00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:28.970
look at the feedback in
the feedback hub or in

173
00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:36.830
a visual studio, that's in,
in VSO, it's just automatically

174
00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:44.120
translated. Obviously their machine translation
is pretty awesome, but still

175
00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:47.330
has some work to go.
So you kinda get used

176
00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:52.700
to some of the phrasing.
My classic example is like

177
00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:59.480
live tiles is frequently translated
as a dynamic blocks. I've

178
00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:02.990
been working with feedback enough
that I know that, but

179
00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.540
we do. We also have
a whole Loke team that,

180
00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:08.000
you know, if we do
have questions about how it's

181
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.750
translated, we can pass it
off to them and they'll

182
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:15.620
let us know what the
intent of the feedback. Yeah.

183
00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:18.350
Cause I assume the feedback
around the lunar calendar, this

184
00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:21.800
is the Chinese lunar calendar
would be coming in China.

185
00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:28.160
Yes. Yeah. We actually added
it with 15 <inaudible>. That

186
00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:32.240
was one of the features.
And that's interesting because that's

187
00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:33.890
like a piece of feedback
that I don't like, I

188
00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:36.080
don't care if it's there
or not, but then there's

189
00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:39.080
a billion people that do
so like that's cool. And

190
00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:41.210
is there, is that one
of those things that like

191
00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:43.820
bubbles up in the sense
of like, we never thought

192
00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:46.100
that anyone would care about
the lunar calendar until the

193
00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:48.740
user said so, or did
you know it and you

194
00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:51.860
just been punting on it
and then it became like

195
00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:56.560
a hot issue with that
Specific example, we first saw

196
00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:02.170
the feedback for the, the
outlook calendar app started getting

197
00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:05.500
a lot of feedback for
the lunar calendar and because

198
00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:08.980
actually all the community chat.
So most of the nodes

199
00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:12.670
in the feedback hub have
associated community champs that kind

200
00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:15.370
of go in and monitor
and make sure the right

201
00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:20.020
stuff's happening. And we actually
have a effectively, a mailing

202
00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:22.870
list where all of us
talk about what's going on.

203
00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:27.160
And so we were aware
of the interest for the

204
00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:31.900
lunar calendar and with the
anniversary update, we kind of,

205
00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:35.890
we integrated calendar into the
taskbar calendar, which was also

206
00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:40.600
actually a top feedback request.
And when that happened, we

207
00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:46.270
did kind of anticipate lunar
calendar requests coming in for

208
00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:50.950
the task force as well.
And it happens, I guess

209
00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:55.810
we, we, we anticipated correctly
and were able to check

210
00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:59.470
that off. But yeah, I
know a lot of people

211
00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:03.700
are concerned that like, you
know, maybe a lot of

212
00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.220
people at Microsoft speak English.
And so, you know, should

213
00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:09.730
I be logging feedback in
English? If I log it

214
00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:13.090
in Portuguese, maybe they don't
understand me or it won't

215
00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:15.610
get acted on as quickly.
But as it actually like

216
00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:19.300
most of the feedback, I
probably can't tell you what

217
00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:22.480
that lunar calendar is a
very specific example. Cause obviously

218
00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:25.750
yes, it comes predominantly from
people who speak Chinese. But

219
00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:29.080
a lot of our other
feedback, I, I don't remember

220
00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.450
what language it came from.
Cause to me it's just

221
00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:36.300
the language of feedback, But
it's not ignored is what

222
00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:39.690
I'm hearing you say. Like
if, if you know, a

223
00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:42.810
thousand Chinese people want a
feature and it gets uploaded

224
00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:44.730
and put into a collection
or some kind of bucket

225
00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:47.190
it's going to be seen
regardless of the language that

226
00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:51.750
it was in. Yep. That's
correct. We do sometimes like

227
00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:57.660
we will pivot feedback by
region our language because sometimes

228
00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:00.330
it can tell us, like
we actually put out a

229
00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:03.810
particular flight where there was
a, there was a bug

230
00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:07.710
in one of the resource
strings and it resulted in

231
00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:12.450
the all apps list, just
being missing. I think it

232
00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:17.550
was for Brazilian and Chinese
simplified. And you know, if

233
00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:20.520
you'd just been, if you'd
been looking at overall feedback,

234
00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:24.210
it wouldn't really have spiked,
but we were able to

235
00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:29.490
see that there was a
larger amount of dissatisfaction amongst

236
00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:32.070
those languages. And we pivoted
the feedback and we were

237
00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:35.820
like, wow, you guys really
need to look into this.

238
00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:39.450
Cause obviously there's something, these
guys are hitting that isn't

239
00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:46.290
impacting any other language. Yeah.
People do notice those outliers.

240
00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:48.930
So sometimes as a user
of windows, you know, and

241
00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:50.550
I w we are a
user as well. So you

242
00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:53.570
have the feelings, there's this
sense of maybe we're not

243
00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:56.990
being heard, you know, like
what about this bug from

244
00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:59.540
nine years ago? That's bugging
you, you know, like there's

245
00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:01.700
a bug that bugs me,
which is, and I don't

246
00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:04.550
know if it's a bug,
it's a behavior. You probably

247
00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:07.460
familiar with this. I feel
like when I go to

248
00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:10.940
explore and I click on
downloads and I have like

249
00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:16.730
me gigabytes in my downloads
folder, there's this pause like

250
00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:21.920
slow. And then there's this
apocryphal like the, the, the,

251
00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:25.700
the, the, the language of
the internet where like people

252
00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:28.190
say, well, if you right
click and say, customize and

253
00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:31.280
change it to general items
instead of picture, you know,

254
00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:33.410
then it'll work. And no
one knows why, but it's

255
00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:36.290
like cargo cult programming, where
it's like, if you twiddle

256
00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:39.200
this bit or change that
register CRE register key that

257
00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:42.650
we don't know anything about
it, we'll fix it. And,

258
00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:44.510
and we go, and we
do that. And then we

259
00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:47.330
wonder why Microsoft doesn't like,
listen to us. How do

260
00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:48.950
they get surfaced? Like, how
do you, how do we

261
00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:52.630
make you hear us? I
mean, I think that part

262
00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:55.270
of that is why it's
cool for us to be

263
00:15:55.990 --> 00:16:00.310
visible externally in social media
as well, because obviously the

264
00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:03.400
feedback hub has its place.
And like, did you look

265
00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:05.920
at top and trending? And
we look at like top

266
00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:09.730
issues for the flight, but
sometimes like when I hang

267
00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:12.070
out with people on run
it, you can really dig

268
00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:16.990
into the specific RevPro, like
the specific kind of device,

269
00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:21.610
why that's important, how long
it's been there. And that's

270
00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:26.860
where, like, we actually, we
had one, I mean, it

271
00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:30.700
was a while back now,
but I was, it was

272
00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:39.460
an issue where if you
had your time zone set

273
00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:44.920
to Venezuelan, then the taskbar
clock was an hour off.

274
00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:49.240
So that if you open
the flyout, the taskbar clock

275
00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:51.670
was an hour off, Fly
out is the thing that

276
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:53.860
happens when you click and
then it pops up and

277
00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:56.080
shows you the calendar. So
the, the task bar was

278
00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:59.830
correct, but in the flout,
it was an hour. And

279
00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:02.650
even though there was feedback
for it in the feedback

280
00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:07.990
hub, it like never, I
mean, it never really reached

281
00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:10.750
critical mass. Cause obviously it's
a very specific set of

282
00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:15.790
users who were impacted, but
in social media, they reached

283
00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:17.710
out to us and they
were like, we really think

284
00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:21.610
you guys should look into
this. Cause it's a consistent

285
00:17:21.610 --> 00:17:25.120
RevPro for me, it seems
really serious. And I took

286
00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:27.160
it to the team and
they were like, wow. Yeah,

287
00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:30.640
that's totally legit. Like we're
on it. And they were

288
00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:32.680
able to fix it in
the next couple of flights.

289
00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:37.600
So sometimes it is really
like making it clear the

290
00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:41.110
steps for how to get
to a certain thing. But

291
00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:44.590
Yeah, you know, that's interesting.
Cause I've found that myself

292
00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:48.340
to be really true that
if you can get, like,

293
00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:50.760
you can complain, you can
like say, Oh, it sucks.

294
00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:53.100
You know, like you said,
it's rubbish, but if you

295
00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:56.190
can give someone a clear
what they call it a

296
00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:58.920
repo, right. If you can
reproduce this and just like

297
00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:02.400
this click here, click here,
click clear, expect this, this

298
00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.950
is wrong. Then it's way,
way easier to get someone

299
00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:09.480
at Microsoft to care and
you know, screenshots welcome all

300
00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.280
that kind of stuff with
a nice circle and an

301
00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:14.610
arrow pointing at it. Like
that's totally wrong. Things do

302
00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:18.380
seem to be getting fixed
faster. It does. I mean,

303
00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:20.750
I think the other thing
to understand is that we

304
00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:24.140
get a lot of feedback.
We get a lot of

305
00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:27.800
issue reports. We get a
lot of feature requests. And

306
00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:30.710
because of that, I mean,
we have to find ways

307
00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:35.060
to prioritize and, and that's
why like the up floats

308
00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:38.270
matter. That's why, you know,
making a clear case for

309
00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:45.380
how this impacts users matters.
Yeah. So that, that's an

310
00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:49.820
aspect as well. The, the
idea of not being heard

311
00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:51.680
is a tough one. Cause
you've got how many millions

312
00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:55.760
of people doing insiders right
now? A hundred million. I

313
00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.700
don't remember the numbers off
hand, but millions though, right?

314
00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:03.320
Something like that. I think
we can go and find

315
00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:06.170
a blog post and they'll
tell us somewhere out there,

316
00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:07.730
like, I don't know the
number, but I know it's

317
00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:09.320
millions, right? So there's a
whole ton of people out

318
00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:12.590
there that are beta testing,
you know, for us. And

319
00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:16.730
then you're saying that you're
getting multiple pieces of feedback

320
00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:20.870
from everybody and the upvotes
are, is that the number

321
00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:24.980
one way for people to
be heard? Floats definitely helps.

322
00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:27.380
I mean, as I said,
like there are real people

323
00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:31.280
going into the feedback hub
and managing all the feedback

324
00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:34.580
that comes in. And while
there are a lot of

325
00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:37.070
different ways that we pivot
it, I mean, the first

326
00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:40.080
thing we do is try
to make sure that the,

327
00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:43.070
the top things coming in
are being addressed and, and

328
00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:46.340
any time like, and as
I said, we do group

329
00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:49.160
feedback. So like, if you
have five items that all

330
00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:51.380
have five upvotes, we grouped
that and then you have

331
00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:55.310
25 of boats, but still
someone needs to come in

332
00:19:55.310 --> 00:20:00.110
and do that. And so
there is sometimes a delay

333
00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:04.040
if something had 25 upvotes
to begin with versus it's

334
00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:06.680
now being tracked as a
25 foot item, if that

335
00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:10.070
makes sense, Do, and I
assume crashes are a kind

336
00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:12.830
of feedback and that gets
bucketed in a more programmatic

337
00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:18.190
way. Yeah. Crashes use the
windows error reporting system and

338
00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:20.780
sexually, like we do look
at feedback about crashes as

339
00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:25.430
well, but we have an
automated system that automatically tells

340
00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:30.050
us that, you know, in,
in flight 15 Oh 31,

341
00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:33.350
we're seeing a large number
of settings crashes due to

342
00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:40.430
whatever the function call is
when someone clicks on device

343
00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:43.520
settings is the crash in
that, in that particular build.

344
00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:48.220
So we actually knew about
that going into the flight,

345
00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:52.990
but obviously our telemetry is
confirming that people are still

346
00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:59.010
trying to access that page,
Which Chris is, I'm looking

347
00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:04.170
at trying to run a
device In the 15 Oh

348
00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:07.530
31 flight. If you open
settings and click on devices,

349
00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:12.540
it will crash crash. They
will crash, Crush up there.

350
00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:18.060
Yup. Poof at that hospital,
It was an unknown issue

351
00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:21.750
for the flight. Usually we
flight is actually a workaround.

352
00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:25.200
If you search for settings,
if you search for the

353
00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:28.620
settings within devices, you will
be able to access those

354
00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:33.030
pages. It's just clicking devices
will crash settings. That's so

355
00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:35.670
weird. Like when, when, and
like from the outside, when

356
00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:37.680
things like that happen, it's
like, how did that, how'd

357
00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:39.690
that happen? What's happening underneath?
Why is that a weird,

358
00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:41.400
we know we want, we,
it makes us wonder how

359
00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:44.040
all these things get, get
fixed. And it also makes

360
00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:47.550
us wonder how you will
decide what the final build

361
00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:50.040
is or the golden build
and what you decide to

362
00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:54.300
give us. Yeah. At some
point, I think a year

363
00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:57.570
ago we made the decision
that we were going to

364
00:21:57.570 --> 00:22:02.100
make fast, faster, which was
actually because of feedback and

365
00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:03.840
setters were like, we want
the builds as soon as

366
00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:08.160
you guys get them. And,
and we agreed that we,

367
00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:11.370
them getting their hands on
the build faster is a

368
00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:16.020
benefit to everyone. Obviously the
cost is that means we

369
00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:20.280
can't, there's some things we
don't find out find fast

370
00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:23.160
enough to fix it before
the flight. And then that's

371
00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:28.290
where we put it as
a known issue. Was it

372
00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:30.960
a conscious decision to make
people go out on social

373
00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:33.390
media? Because I've noticed that
you're on social media a

374
00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:36.330
lot more than like maybe
a year ago. I know

375
00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:41.880
that what's her name? Donna
Succar is out a lot.

376
00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:46.230
Sarkar people, people are out
there like looking around. Cause

377
00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:50.160
sometimes I feel like I'm
finding bugs just by looking

378
00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:52.680
on Twitter. And it sounds
like you're doing the same

379
00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:59.940
thing sometimes. Yeah, yeah. Actually.
So the, the community champion

380
00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:08.940
role started not that long
after the, the windows insider

381
00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:16.290
program itself started, I actually
began doing it in February, 2015.

382
00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:21.180
This is my two year
anniversary. I officially started on

383
00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:24.060
Reddit over a year and
a half ago and on

384
00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:29.940
Twitter a year ago. And
yeah, the idea was, has

385
00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:32.700
always been about letting people
know that their voices are

386
00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:39.060
heard and trying to understand
the incoming feedback and let

387
00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:41.460
them know how things are
being changed because of their

388
00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:48.380
feedback. So more and more
teams are getting engineers to

389
00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:52.100
take on this kind of
role. We still do have

390
00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:53.870
a lot more people in
the backend to look at

391
00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:57.800
feedback. Cause then you might
see online. So a lot

392
00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:59.450
of people will report stuff
to me on Reddit and

393
00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:03.710
Twitter. And I love all
of it. Obviously I don't

394
00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:05.450
have time to look into
all of it. And so

395
00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:08.000
sometimes like, you know, I
might, I might share the

396
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.560
feedback with the lock screen
community champion, or I might

397
00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:16.580
share the feedback with the
photos community champion, and then

398
00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:21.520
they'll look into it on
their end. So you sound

399
00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:23.470
like your job is kind
of similar to mine. I

400
00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:25.240
mean, although mine seems like
it's more of a hobby

401
00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:27.010
than I don't really have
time to do. It is

402
00:24:27.610 --> 00:24:29.770
you're like, you're like a
bug router at the high

403
00:24:29.770 --> 00:24:32.440
level, like anything show related
and you're routing that bug.

404
00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:34.630
Cause I feel like I
do that a lot. I

405
00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:36.400
didn't actually go out and
decide that would be a

406
00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:41.920
job though. People just started
tweeting me bugs, Something like

407
00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:44.980
that. Yeah. I mean, it
kind of helps it inherently.

408
00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:49.570
My team covers some pretty
diverse areas. And so I've

409
00:24:49.570 --> 00:24:52.600
always worked a lot with
partner teams to make sure

410
00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:58.570
the right people are looking
into the issue. But yeah,

411
00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:00.970
just as more and more
people are familiar with me

412
00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:04.660
and social media, people just
feel comfortable approaching me about

413
00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:07.990
things they think should be
looked into. And, and I

414
00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:10.720
make sure it happens as
much as I can. I

415
00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:13.360
think people, once people realize
that you're on their side

416
00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:16.270
and that you are like
not inherently evil and do

417
00:25:16.270 --> 00:25:18.640
actually have an interest in
fixing that bug. But also

418
00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:20.590
like you said that the
flight like in a week

419
00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:23.380
or two could have a
bug fix, it moves that

420
00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:26.260
fast. That's where I think
things get interesting if it's

421
00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:28.930
like, yeah, we'll fix it
in a year. Then somehow

422
00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:33.130
talking to you becomes less
interesting. We have, we've put

423
00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:35.740
in a lot of effort
over the last. I mean

424
00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:41.170
the insider program has and
feedback. I've really grown a

425
00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:48.670
lot since it first started
October 1st, 2014 and, and one of

426
00:25:48.670 --> 00:25:51.640
the, and in one of
those ways is really trying

427
00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:53.740
to work on our flight
notes to make sure that,

428
00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:57.490
you know, if people report
issues, we try to make

429
00:25:57.490 --> 00:26:01.300
sure those are the ones
bubbled up in the improvements

430
00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:04.810
list for that flight. Cause
obviously, I mean, every flight

431
00:26:05.050 --> 00:26:07.360
can have thousands of fixes.
And so we have to

432
00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:10.330
find a way to, to
focus on the ones that

433
00:26:10.330 --> 00:26:12.070
people really care about. And
so we do a lot

434
00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:15.520
of work to make sure
that you do see that,

435
00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:18.730
Hey, you reached out to
us about this and not

436
00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:20.980
only did we fix it,
but we're letting you know

437
00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:23.050
that we fixed it. So
please go and check it

438
00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:26.500
out and let us know
how it went. Let me

439
00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:29.800
ask a loaded question. Cause
like we wouldn't be a

440
00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:34.180
podcast unless I totally jumped
you from behind and said,

441
00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:37.750
ah, you answer this question,
do you, will you, will

442
00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:39.970
you answer, will you, is
it still going to be

443
00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:43.080
a bug if like a
Twitter egg asks you? You

444
00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:44.310
know what I mean? Like
what if like there's like

445
00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:48.750
famous person has bug versus
egg has bug, do you

446
00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:51.470
listen to the eggs? Yeah.
I mean, I listen to

447
00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:55.100
everyone as much as possible,
But seriously you do. Like

448
00:26:55.130 --> 00:26:57.200
if it's a legit bug,
it doesn't matter whether the

449
00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:00.410
person's verified or not. Nope.
It doesn't matter. I mean,

450
00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:04.250
as long as like you
can communicate what the issue

451
00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:07.460
is and maybe share feedback,
if you're willing to get

452
00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:12.260
logs, if you're willing to
share a screenshot, I'll look

453
00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:16.220
into it. Do, is it
screenshots or videos? What's the

454
00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:18.800
best way to get feedback?
Is it the feedback like

455
00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:20.750
the hub and then send
you a link to something?

456
00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:25.940
I mean the feedback hub
is Yeah. I was just

457
00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:28.460
gonna have to bring the
feedback hub. It's actually, it's,

458
00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:32.840
it's really cool that, so
obviously on Twitter kind of

459
00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:35.330
things are more one off
and like people might like

460
00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:38.240
a post, but they may
not actually be impacted by

461
00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:42.110
it. Whereas on Reddit, people
will actually get into much

462
00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:45.860
longer discussions of, you know,
the design or like how

463
00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:48.860
they got impacted by something.
And it's been really cool

464
00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:52.370
that like, I mean, I
love Reddit, but over the

465
00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:55.580
last year we've really seen
an increase in something spikes

466
00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:59.900
and Reddit. And then you
see a correlating spike in

467
00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:04.070
the feedback hub. And that's
really what makes my job

468
00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:07.700
easier because in the past,
like people would get really

469
00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:10.460
upset about something on Reddit,
but then you didn't kind

470
00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:13.700
of have any of that
correlating evidence on the feedback

471
00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:16.340
hub. And I still take
the feedback to my team.

472
00:28:16.370 --> 00:28:19.370
But since the feedback hub
is really where we track

473
00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:22.700
everything, it does make it
a little bit more difficult

474
00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:26.030
if I can't be like,
look, they, they clearly have

475
00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:29.780
this issue on Reddit, but
it's not there in the

476
00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:33.290
feedback hub. So there's a
bit more of a correlation

477
00:28:33.290 --> 00:28:36.680
now, which I love One
of the things I noticed.

478
00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:38.150
I don't know when it
happened, but I'm in the

479
00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:40.910
feedback hub right now. And
I'm like, there's some stuff

480
00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:42.740
that has like a thousand
or one thing has like

481
00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:45.410
10,000 up votes. And then
this is, I don't know

482
00:28:45.410 --> 00:28:47.750
if this is new. It
says an official response has

483
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:52.220
been posted. So that's like
super awesome. Like right now

484
00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:54.710
I see one that says
the Bluetooth settings page doesn't

485
00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:57.620
open. This is the one
you mentioned. I click there

486
00:28:57.620 --> 00:28:59.390
and it says a fix
for this will be out

487
00:28:59.390 --> 00:29:04.790
in the next build, like
rock on Microsoft respond. We

488
00:29:04.790 --> 00:29:11.990
have four States currently we
have, we've got it, looking

489
00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:16.460
into it, working on it
and changes made. And that's

490
00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:20.210
all from our backend. And,
and we can set the

491
00:29:20.210 --> 00:29:22.730
state. We can set like
a build number where the,

492
00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:26.060
the fix or the feature
is in there. We can

493
00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:30.380
add sticky comments. Currently. The
only people who have permission

494
00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:33.830
to add sticky comments are
the community champs, which makes

495
00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:38.720
sense. I just found one
from you just now. Oh,

496
00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:43.630
which one is it? Action
center appears Transparent in build

497
00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:48.940
1501 four. Yup. You have
like a work around and

498
00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:50.950
you're like, we're looking at
it and here's a workaround.

499
00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:53.230
So like that's awesome. Here's
the one that you're going

500
00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:56.200
to have to address now
because the world is demanding.

501
00:29:56.560 --> 00:30:01.020
Notepad should support the dark
theme. That is Mary Jo

502
00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:03.850
Foley's fault. Is that what
that is? So there's that

503
00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:06.420
like someone is like, you
know, sitting on and saying

504
00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:10.740
you have to support this.
No, no. She just, she's

505
00:30:10.890 --> 00:30:15.240
very fond of notepad and
I'm very fond of dark

506
00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:17.880
seam. I was actually the
one to publish that collection

507
00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:23.130
and yeah, she, she shared
that. Well actually I think

508
00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:25.980
it was rich Turner who
started it, but she shared

509
00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:31.770
an interest in having dark,
having notepad update to support

510
00:30:31.770 --> 00:30:35.010
dark theme. And I don't
know if that's the kind

511
00:30:35.010 --> 00:30:39.030
of hard hitting bug fixing
that we really know what

512
00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:42.270
I mean. Like there's people
who want like obscure Linuxy

513
00:30:42.270 --> 00:30:45.810
things for the windows subsystem
for Linux, but then there's

514
00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:49.650
update notepad. I don't know
Because I mean, the thing

515
00:30:49.650 --> 00:30:52.380
you have to understand is
that there are tons and

516
00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:55.260
tons and tons of different
types of people who use

517
00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:59.610
windows. And actually like, you
know, maybe notepads supporting dark

518
00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:03.000
theme is only one item
that we're tracking, but we

519
00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.740
actually do track across the
board. So, okay. You probably

520
00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:09.420
wouldn't know, but like my
team was actually the one

521
00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:16.140
that added the dark theme
switch in settings. And one

522
00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:18.300
of the things we track
is like, we've added this

523
00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:23.370
feature, but obviously we rely
on apps and surfaces to

524
00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:27.000
update, to support it. And
so we kind of work

525
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.520
with all our partner teams
just to let them know

526
00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:34.110
we implemented this based on
feedback and you're getting feedback

527
00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:35.640
for this too. And you
have to be aware that

528
00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:39.390
like, don't just consider your
own feedback numbers, but consider

529
00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:42.480
the picture as a whole,
like, you know, maybe dark

530
00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:45.420
theme here for your app
only has 4,000, but we

531
00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:49.110
have, you know, 10,000 asking
for dark timber windows. We

532
00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:53.730
have another, you know, 5,000
being like, please every surface

533
00:31:53.730 --> 00:31:58.080
should support dark theme. And
so we, we try to,

534
00:31:58.350 --> 00:32:01.590
we work with our partners
to make sure that they

535
00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:04.440
look at the feedback as
a whole. Yeah, that makes

536
00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:08.280
sense. So like from a
UX perspective, you're saying dark

537
00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:09.690
theme is now a thing
that we should all be

538
00:32:09.690 --> 00:32:12.090
thinking about and it isn't
about notepad in that case.

539
00:32:12.090 --> 00:32:15.570
It's about everybody. Yes. And
our theme is awesome. So,

540
00:32:15.570 --> 00:32:19.320
you know, I'm not a
fan. I do like the

541
00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:22.560
new nightlight thing though. That's
pretty cool. And I'm going

542
00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:24.330
to go right now and
upvote the thing that says

543
00:32:24.330 --> 00:32:28.750
slow down the transitions. Cause
it's too jarring. It should

544
00:32:28.910 --> 00:32:32.910
have been working on slowing
it down, but it's more

545
00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:36.390
feedback cause I always appreciate
it. Cool. So where can

546
00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:40.490
people find you on the
internets? I am Jen MSFT.

547
00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:43.670
I started that way on
Reddit because it seemed like

548
00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:46.850
the most obvious way to
let people know that I

549
00:32:46.850 --> 00:32:51.140
was affiliated with Microsoft since
then. I'm friends with most

550
00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:53.840
of the mods for the
Microsoft subreddits. So they've actually

551
00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:58.010
added a flare to my
account there to let people

552
00:32:58.010 --> 00:33:01.700
know I'm official. But when
I transitioned to Twitter, I

553
00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:05.630
became genom ft on Twitter
as well. And some people

554
00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:07.760
seem to think I'm the
only gen at Microsoft. I

555
00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:10.480
can assure you. There are
many more. I can assure

556
00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:14.260
you that there are many
Scott's unfortunately dozens and dozens

557
00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:17.350
of us. Thanks for chatting
with me today. Yeah. Thanks

558
00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:20.530
for having me. This has
been another episode of Hansel

559
00:33:20.530 --> 00:33:22.390
minutes. We'll see you again
next week.
