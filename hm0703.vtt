Hanselman. This is another Hansel

9
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.840
minutes today. I'm talking with
Joseph White. He created the Pico

10
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.550
eight living in Japan and
working at Lexa lawful. Did

11
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.880
I pronounce that correctly? Yep.
That's right. So this started

12
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.040
out in your bed, in
your bedroom, in the mid,

13
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.590
in the early nineties, selling
shareware. And now it is

14
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.830
a wonderful thing online that
we'll talk about. Yeah, it's,

15
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.690
it's possible to trace the
path quite far back. This,

16
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.780
this was in New Zealand where
there was no, no internet.

17
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.800
Really? I was using BBSs
and distributing shareware on mail

18
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.030
order catalogs. That's how I
started out actually doing shareware.

19
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.850
I ran a bulletin board
on Wildcat PBS. Oh, that's

20
00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.750
great. Yeah, my boss, in
fact, current, I didn't know

21
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.000
this cause I'm, you know,
I was a high school

22
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.300
student in the, in the
late eighties running on Wildcat.

23
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.730
And now in fact, my
boss@microsoftwhoowns.net was the guy that

24
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.840
wrote Wildcat BBS. So now
small world. Yeah, it is.

25
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.070
So you're in Japan. And
how did, how did Pico

26
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.260
age start Pico eight. If
I can understand the right

27
00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.680
way to phrase it, you
call it a fantasy console.

28
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.310
Like I'm writing software and
games for a console, but

29
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.520
it doesn't exist. I can't
buy this console. Right. I

30
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.990
wanted to find a term,
which I didn't want to

31
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.020
call it a consult emulator
because you know, that has

32
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.200
a lot of baggage that
comes with it. First of

33
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.240
all, it implies that the
machine actually existed at one

34
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.620
point, which PicoWay didn't. But
I also wanted a way

35
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.460
to describe it. That was
a little bit self-explanatory. So,

36
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.610
you know, the fantasy part
of it sounds like it

37
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.070
doesn't really exist, but it
also sounds like it's something

38
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.910
that, you know, it's as
you want it to be,

39
00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.150
where, how are you want
something to be? And if

40
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.970
you say, if it's an
emulator that implies that there

41
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.150
is a theoretical CPU and
memory spec out there that,

42
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.560
that a computer fits perfectly
and Pico weight runs everywhere.

43
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.380
Does it have a spec
though? Like, does it have

44
00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.220
a fantasy CPU? So it
kind of does, but it

45
00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.490
doesn't actually go very far
down. I, I was Tempted

46
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.550
to, you know, come up
with an instruction state and

47
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.370
a machine language and everything
like this and, and build

48
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.130
what I would call a
complete vertical console or a

49
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.310
vertical Confederacy console. But it
only goes down to the

50
00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.240
level of feeling like there
might be underlying hardware. So

51
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.280
it goes down to it
to, to a Lu a

52
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.730
virtual machine. And, you know,
once I had that running

53
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.220
and I wrote some programs,
that's actually, when I realized,

54
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.310
Oh, I don't actually need
to really go further than

55
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.970
that. I can just say
that it runs on the,

56
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.320
a virtual machine and that's,
it that's enough. And it

57
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.840
has kind of a specification
in the sense of Lua,

58
00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.140
assuming Paco eight games, and
the interface is limited to

59
00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.130
128 by 128 pixels, 16
color display and four channel

60
00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.310
audio. Right. That's the Right.
So those, yeah, those are

61
00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.310
the important specifications. Those are
the ones that are immediately

62
00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.250
obvious to the user and
what gives the machine, its

63
00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.360
its character. So, so things
like the screen size and

64
00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.720
the pellet, they have an
enormous impact on the way

65
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.990
the machine feels to users.
But in the past they

66
00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.130
were just, you know, byproducts
of what hardware was available

67
00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.010
and market forces and things
like this. But peak peak

68
00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.130
rate is, is an attempt
to design those specifications from

69
00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.100
scratch in a way that
has some sort of holistic

70
00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.330
aesthetic value to it. Are
there are frames per second

71
00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.330
specifications or like, does everything
run at 30 or 60

72
00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.400
or something? And yet it
started out as, as dirty.

73
00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.690
I felt 30 was, was
it a good sort of

74
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.920
starting point for new users
where if you see something

75
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.100
flashed by, in one frame
at 60 frames per second,

76
00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.400
you can't really see what
happened at 30 frames per

77
00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.430
second. You can make animations
that look good, you know,

78
00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.580
running at 30 frames per
second. But later on, you

79
00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.760
know, there were a lot
of 60 frames per second

80
00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.420
fans that kind of pushed
me over the edge and

81
00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.420
I was happy to oblige
and edit in 60 frames

82
00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.600
mode. Okay. So there are
in, in their actual independent

83
00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.570
mode. So it maintains compatibility
with anything that was made

84
00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.020
before, right? Yeah. You need
to make that conscious decision

85
00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.640
when you start a project
for it to be 60

86
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:10.770
frames. So it's, it's 2019
and I'm, you know, I

87
00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.960
went back in time a
little bit and I looked

88
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.160
up the original game boy,
because I think that's where

89
00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.680
it all started. Right. Everything
started at the game boy.

90
00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.140
And I note that the
game boy had a screen

91
00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:25.590
resolution even many, many years
ago of one 60 by

92
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.490
one 44. So here you
are in the 21st century

93
00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.210
making something with an extraordinarily
limited screen display. Do you

94
00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.660
think that's part of its
charm? Yeah. It's so there

95
00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.780
are lots of sides to
that. I wanted to go

96
00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.060
as low as I could
possibly go, because it was

97
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.540
sort of interesting, you know,
as, as a pixel artist,

98
00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.660
when you're drawing something, it's,
it's interesting having an extremely

99
00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.810
tight constraint and it adds
a lot more to the

100
00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.940
character of the machine. If
it's low resolution, if I

101
00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:58.250
picked something sort of halfway
between the GameBoy and the

102
00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.080
feminine, the Nintendo entertainment system
or something like that, I

103
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.870
think it sort of would
have been more lost in,

104
00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.410
you know, the sort of
perception of a mishmash of

105
00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.010
ritual machines. It doesn't really
look like anything new, whereas

106
00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:17.470
128 squared looks like quite
a different, shocking thing. Yeah,

107
00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:19.840
it is, it is shocking.
And it's like, wow, how

108
00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.420
could this be? How could
this be useful? It is

109
00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:27.760
so constrained, but the brain
almost for lack of a

110
00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.270
better word, almost fills in
the lack of detail, the,

111
00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:35.170
the, the animations are very
evocative. There's clever use of

112
00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:37.720
anti Elliot scene, but you've
only got 128 by 128

113
00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.170
square to go with. So
your brain, at least when

114
00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:44.140
I think of PicoWay games
after I played them fills

115
00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:47.410
in the gaps and it
becomes as, as high resolution

116
00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:51.100
as it needs to be.
Yeah. There's, it's surprising what

117
00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:54.130
you can get away with
at that resolution. I think

118
00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:56.470
there's sort of two ways
that the brain fills in

119
00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:59.980
the gaps. One is, you
know, when everything's moving and

120
00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:04.060
you have this extra temporal
information, it's, it's amazing how

121
00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:07.450
good, you know, some three-dimensional
things, look, you don't really

122
00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:10.060
feel that low resolution, but
if you show someone a

123
00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:13.630
still frame of the three
D object, it just looks

124
00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:16.930
like a big Pixley miss.
But, but the way that

125
00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:20.200
I was originally planning or
hoping it would work out

126
00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:25.960
is that the sort of
graphical styles that people would

127
00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.620
go for would be more
symbolic and feel almost like

128
00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:33.160
a text based game architect,
adventure, or, you know, like

129
00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:37.780
a roguelike style where you're
not really worrying too much

130
00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:41.800
about, you know, refining, visual
look, but you're, you're sort

131
00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.980
of designing tokens that are
more, you know, it feels

132
00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:47.020
more like board game tokens
on a board or something

133
00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:50.110
like that. Yeah. Some of
the games and there's, I

134
00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:52.840
mean, how many are there
now? Thousands. Yeah. There's, there's

135
00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:56.980
five between five and 10,000.
I didn't get 5%. Wow.

136
00:07:57.250 --> 00:07:58.660
So some of the games
do have that kind of

137
00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:02.830
token style where it's a
side scroller or it's like,

138
00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:06.340
like a Zelda kind of
a game. And then other

139
00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:11.260
ones are pushing the limits.
They're both very, they're both

140
00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:14.020
very, you know, eight bit
in their style, but they

141
00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:19.600
have parallax scrolling and they
have implied depth that gives

142
00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.600
you a sense of an
expansive world. So you're looking

143
00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.150
at a view on something
that could be tens of

144
00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:28.840
thousands of pixels wide or
more, Right? Yeah. There are,

145
00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:33.670
there's a real range of
visual style and pick away

146
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:37.840
at games and very visually
beautiful games that I didn't

147
00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:41.320
really expect. Has there been
a particular game or games

148
00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:44.230
or style of game where
you really didn't expect it?

149
00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:46.480
Like, you're just like, no,
that is not at all

150
00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:47.710
what I thought you're gonna
be able to do. And

151
00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:50.100
now I love that you
did it. So I, I

152
00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:52.240
had hoped that the demo
scene would, would latch on

153
00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:56.100
to pick away a little
bit. And so the demo

154
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.440
scene for, for those who
don't know is, is a,

155
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:02.490
it's a group of people
making programs that you sit

156
00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:05.160
back and watch, and you
can kind of imagine them

157
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.950
like music videos, but everything
is generated in real time.

158
00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:10.170
So you just create a
program that has, you know,

159
00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:13.920
nice music and visuals, and
often the whole program fixed,

160
00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:16.170
fits into a small site,
six 64 K or four

161
00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:21.510
K. So Pico eight is
a good platform for that,

162
00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:26.220
but I didn't expect the
number and quality of, of

163
00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:28.800
demos coming up for peak
to be what it is.

164
00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:32.690
They're really quite delightful and
phenomenal. I think that that

165
00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:37.580
in, in a world where
computers are becoming infinitely powerful,

166
00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:39.800
I mean, I'm even now
I'm, I'm on a, an

167
00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:44.060
I nine with 20 odd
processors and an Nvidia 10

168
00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:46.850
80 that I just bought.
And now apparently I need

169
00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:50.330
Ray tracing. Cause my, my
10 80 is now my

170
00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:54.380
$600 video card is now
really $300 on Craigslist. And

171
00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:57.290
everyone says, I should buy
a fancy one. There seems

172
00:09:57.290 --> 00:10:00.260
to be a Renaissance happening.
And it is a Renaissance

173
00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:04.280
of constraints. As we get
infinite power, we want less

174
00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:05.690
and we want to be
put in a box and

175
00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:08.090
then we want to push
as far as we can

176
00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:09.650
against the outside of that
box and see what we

177
00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:12.200
can do in a few
K or a few pixels.

178
00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:20.270
That's right. I think, yeah,
with, with modern hardware, you

179
00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:23.030
can basically make anything you
want. And as a designer,

180
00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:25.190
you get a little bit
lost in that. So it's

181
00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:27.380
a, it's a nice feeling
to come back to a

182
00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:32.150
constrained environment. Yeah. Constrained environments
were where I started out

183
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:34.490
in one of my first
big shareware games was LA

184
00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:36.860
I should first word share
where apps or another, pardon

185
00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:38.900
me was on a Palm
pilot. And I had, I

186
00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:41.330
had four K of a,
of heap to work in

187
00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:43.160
and that was it. And
there was no math library.

188
00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.040
So you would find yourself
trying to do something and

189
00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:47.990
saying, I don't have a
library to call on. I

190
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:51.050
can't just NPM install this.
I have to write it

191
00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:54.560
from scratch. I'm seeing that
people are creating first person

192
00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:58.940
shooters and you don't provide
any, any, you know, engine.

193
00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:02.390
There's no unity for Pico
eight. Is there? No, it's,

194
00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:06.680
it's really. So the most
you get is a Sprite

195
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:10.400
drawing function. That's the most
sort of advanced, you know,

196
00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.110
you can, so you can
stretch one slice of a

197
00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:15.170
Sprite, which is useful for
drawing things like Wolf 3d

198
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:19.490
walls. But yeah, apart from
that, you need to, I

199
00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:21.260
mean, you don't even get
a sorting function. If you

200
00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.890
need to sort things by,
by Zed, you have to

201
00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:27.350
figure out how to sort
that, and you probably can't

202
00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:29.930
use image sot every frame
or something like that. You,

203
00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:31.760
you know, you need to
come up with tricks, like

204
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.840
doing incremental bubble sorts to,
you know, keep everything in

205
00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:37.700
the right order. So that
something far away is not

206
00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:41.390
physically in front of something
that's close. I thought about

207
00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:43.100
giving them that and saying
that this is going to

208
00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:47.330
become more of an engine.
Well, I think part of

209
00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.690
the fun of Pico eight
is first of all, you

210
00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:53.090
know, having an excuse to
revisit all of these classic

211
00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:58.080
graphics algorithms and writing things
from scratch, but also for

212
00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:02.140
newer program is to know
that there is no magic

213
00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:07.690
and everything that you see
in your program is built,

214
00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:09.640
you know, block by block,
right down to drawing a

215
00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:13.690
pixel on the screen. So
they have, they understand the,

216
00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:16.560
the metal like this is
the new metal. There's no,

217
00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:18.780
I've obviously I've talked about
this because I used to

218
00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:21.480
be a computer science professor,
is that when I learned

219
00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:23.460
programming and presumably when you
did as well, I assume

220
00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:26.520
we're somewhere around the similar
age we learned on the

221
00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:30.360
metal, like here's a register
and here's assembly language. And

222
00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:33.990
now for web developers, the
metal is F 12 tools

223
00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:36.390
and the metal is a
JavaScript version machine. So why

224
00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:39.780
not make new metal? Yeah.
And I mean, sort of

225
00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:43.410
growing up in that era,
learning, sorry, I mean, I'm

226
00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:46.020
still at C program and
I really love the language

227
00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:50.220
being minimal. And you know,
you can poke insight in

228
00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:52.710
either any library and there's
a kind of a vaguely

229
00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:55.200
similar programming style that you
can get your head around

230
00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:58.860
and things like this. So,
so when I'm doing things

231
00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:01.650
like web development and suddenly
I have all these libraries

232
00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:04.110
and all of this magic
going on, it's very disconcerting

233
00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:08.970
and difficult to adjust. So
you're not comfortable with unlimited

234
00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:13.110
power. Well, even, Yeah, even
if I'm using a system

235
00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:19.020
that gives me something like,
you know, Sprite sorting, or

236
00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:21.570
it has like an animation
system built in. The first

237
00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:24.510
thing I do is just
instinctively throw it away and

238
00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:28.620
figure out how I can
ignore it. And you just

239
00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:30.780
either ignore it or do
it yourself from scratch again.

240
00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:33.720
Yeah. I try to sort
of do things the proper

241
00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:37.620
way and not reinvent the
wheel, but I think it

242
00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:39.720
actually invariably blows up in
my face. And I, you

243
00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:42.840
know, at some point I
need to, I need some

244
00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:45.990
feature that doesn't exist or
it's slow for some reason

245
00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:49.800
I don't understand or something
like this. So folks can

246
00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:53.850
go to Lexa, lawful.com and
they can immediately just right

247
00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:56.250
off the bat, hit the
play button and they're playing

248
00:13:56.310 --> 00:14:00.180
a Pico eight game in
the browser. What is happening

249
00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:04.320
here? Is this a JavaScript
implementation of the fantasy console?

250
00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:07.620
Yeah. It's so it's actually
a compiled straight from my

251
00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:12.690
C source base to, I
think the default one is

252
00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:17.700
still JavaScript. ASM dot JS
is a subset of JavaScript

253
00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:20.850
that can be compiled. It
can be, it can run

254
00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:24.030
very fast. You can write
optimizes for it, knowing that

255
00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:27.750
it's a subset and also
whip assembly. There's a WebAssembly

256
00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:32.310
version. That's not actually live
yet. And then it also

257
00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:34.650
people can go and get
it on windows, Mac, Linux,

258
00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:37.440
raspberry pie. And because you're
writing it all in C

259
00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:39.960
presumably you're writing it in
portable C and just cross

260
00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:43.290
compiling it for basically anything.
So Pico eight has the

261
00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:48.180
potentially the potentiality rather to
run anywhere. That's right. And

262
00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:51.230
I think that's one of
the features of this of

263
00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:53.510
system is that you can
just write it once in

264
00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:56.420
one place and know that
it's going to run roughly

265
00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:59.600
anywhere and look the same
for other users. And that's,

266
00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:03.830
that's one reason that Pico
eight has a sort of

267
00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:07.930
a virtual CPU speed. So
if you are in an

268
00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:12.200
incredibly fast machine and you
write a program that is

269
00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:16.220
very expensive, it will artificially
slow it down. So it

270
00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:19.180
looks the same on a
raspy, probably one. I see.

271
00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:21.070
So you could have, you
could throw unlimited power at

272
00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:23.290
it and potentially do things
that you couldn't do on

273
00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:25.930
a lower powered machine. But
for the most part, it

274
00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:29.620
does have a preferred and
maximum speed so that all

275
00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:32.710
the games will run as,
as they were expected. Right.

276
00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.540
It's, it's actually, I mean,
in a way it's part

277
00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:39.700
of the, the sort of
aesthetically driven specification, where I

278
00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:43.930
attribute CPU costs to different
operations, like drawing sprites and

279
00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:47.830
putting pixels. And so when
you designing your game and

280
00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:50.350
your algorithm, you have to
sort of work around these,

281
00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:54.340
these limits. And I think
it helps designers, you know,

282
00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:58.360
leads designers down a path.
They wouldn't necessarily take Hi

283
00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:02.110
friends as a programmer. You
think in objects with Mongo

284
00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:05.770
DB. So does your database,
Mongo DB is the most

285
00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:09.700
popular document based database built
for modern application developers on

286
00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:14.140
the cloud era, millions of
developers use Mongo DB to

287
00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:18.190
power. The world's most innovative
products and services from cryptocurrency

288
00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:22.870
to online gaming IOT and
more, you can try Mongo

289
00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:26.950
DB today with Atlas, the
global cloud database service that

290
00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:31.900
runs on AWS Azure and
Google cloud configure, deploy and

291
00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:34.900
connect to your database in
just a few minutes, check

292
00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:40.930
it out at Mongo db.com/atlas.
That's M O N G

293
00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:45.970
O D b.com/atlas. Now I
went up there and started

294
00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:49.870
playing and got entranced. And
I went and I purchased

295
00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:52.420
it and I was, it
was $15 U S and

296
00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:54.190
I was now, I'm now
able to run it anywhere.

297
00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:57.160
And when I downloaded Pico
eight and installed it in

298
00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:00.280
case my case on windows,
I noted that it isn't

299
00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:03.970
just a runner. It is
its own, you know, IDE

300
00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:06.100
for lack of a better
word. You can you write

301
00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:11.110
Pico eight apps with the
PicoWay tools, Right? And in

302
00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:13.780
fact, that's, that's where it
really started was not as

303
00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:17.320
a virtual or authentically console,
but as a home computer

304
00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:22.270
called licks 500 was the
original title. And the idea

305
00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:24.970
was that it would feel
like a BBC micro, which

306
00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:29.530
was one of the first
machines I, I used, but

307
00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:34.180
it would make it easy
to, to author content directly

308
00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:36.160
in the machine. So it's,
it's what I wish a

309
00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:39.040
BBC micro was like, you
know, you can write programs,

310
00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:41.590
but you can also just
flip into a different screen

311
00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:43.240
and draw the sprites that
you want to use in

312
00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:46.060
your program. Yeah. You, you
just flipped kind of naturally

313
00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:50.040
back and forth between them.
It feels though a little

314
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:52.530
bit constrained. One of the
things that my son, my

315
00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:54.930
11 year old who's working
on a Pico eight game

316
00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:56.670
right now has found is
that he finally feels that

317
00:17:56.670 --> 00:18:00.150
the font is so constrained
that he's, his eyes are

318
00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:02.100
blurring a little bit. Cause
it's all caps, it's a

319
00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:05.250
pixel based font. Do you
find, as you talk to

320
00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:08.700
your authors, do most people
write their Pico eight games

321
00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:12.500
entirely in the Pico eight
environment? So it it's around,

322
00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:15.980
I did a very informal,
you know, poll on Twitter,

323
00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:18.710
which is very biased, but
it was around 50 54

324
00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:23.270
people using the editor and
using external tools for yeah.

325
00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:26.180
The font is terrible. It's,
it's sort of, I'm glad

326
00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:28.040
that you said that, you
know, I'm like, you know,

327
00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:32.180
I'm not, I have no
illusions about that. In fact,

328
00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:36.830
in the original design, I
was really imagined like, assuming

329
00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:39.320
that I would need to
have a text mode or

330
00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:42.620
at least a sort of
text overlay, plain, that you

331
00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:46.220
would write text to separately
so that, you know, specifically

332
00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:47.870
so that I could use
it in the code editor.

333
00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:52.250
But then I started fooling
around with, with fonts and

334
00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:55.010
it started looking possible at
the whole thing and 128

335
00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:57.740
squared, which I never imagined
was possible and like that.

336
00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:00.560
So that idea was so
pure. And so, you know,

337
00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:03.170
so exciting to me at
the time that there was

338
00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:04.850
no way that I could
go back to something more

339
00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:07.220
practical. And that's, that's, I
mean, that's kind of a

340
00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:10.430
common pattern in all of
the areas of big waste

341
00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:13.490
design. Like, Hey, I sort
of found something that was

342
00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:17.540
too sort of entertaining to
me as a designer and

343
00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:19.310
program that I couldn't let
it go. And I know

344
00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:22.370
that it's gonna cause people
trouble, but I, you know,

345
00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:25.750
I'm trying to cause people
interesting and sort of funny

346
00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:29.450
trouble, not bad trouble. If
I can make that distinction,

347
00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:32.650
That is a fixed really
well said. And that has

348
00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:34.430
a really good way to
put it because that's exactly

349
00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:36.680
what I felt. I was
like, okay, this is, this

350
00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:38.960
is cute. This is interesting,
but I'm old and my

351
00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:41.660
eyes hurt. So I want
to figure out a way

352
00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:43.430
to do this. So I
start poking around and I

353
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:47.540
learned about the cartridges and
the, the, the, the, how

354
00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:49.430
they're stored, how the text
is stored. And then I

355
00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:53.180
found a visual studio code
plugin that would allow me

356
00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:55.790
to write these things in
a different editor and move

357
00:19:55.790 --> 00:20:00.170
seamlessly back and forth, taking
the.pa file and the source

358
00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:02.600
code between the two. And
then now I can just

359
00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:04.580
write it in visual studio
code and hit F five

360
00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:08.510
and it runs Pico eight.
So it was a charming

361
00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:10.940
problem to have, it was
not annoying in it by

362
00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:14.870
any means. Yeah. I, I
tried to make the, so

363
00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:17.510
there are two versions of
the cartridge format. There is

364
00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:20.720
a sort of distributable image
format, but there's also a

365
00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:25.550
default text format, which is
yeah. It's designed to be

366
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.370
directly editable by a text
editor so that you can

367
00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:33.100
sort of escape the, the
font, The idea that everything

368
00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:35.330
be self contained. I think
there was also part of

369
00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:37.610
its charm. Even the text
based format is effectively just

370
00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:40.160
one file. You don't have
15 different files that they

371
00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:44.330
all work together on. It's
just one thing, Right. I

372
00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:49.480
think having, I mean, one
file is kind of convenient,

373
00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:53.020
but I, I suppose that's
more of an implementation detail.

374
00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:57.460
Like, you know, if you'd
never used an external editor

375
00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:01.210
peak rate could completely hide
that fact. And it would

376
00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:04.300
just look the same. And
then, you know, when you're

377
00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:07.480
sharing cartridges, you don't usually
share the text file that

378
00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:10.570
you normally use. Right. You
can only save to clipboard

379
00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:12.790
and then paste it into
an email or, you know,

380
00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:14.830
upload it to the server
and send someone the ID

381
00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:17.700
to download it or something
like that. Yeah. Certainly you

382
00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:21.030
could make this a virtual
internal file system and hide

383
00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:23.370
all those details. Right. But
then again, it wouldn't be

384
00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:27.270
quite so charming. Yeah. I,
I, I think dot paid

385
00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:30.180
files, so kind of cute
somehow, and it's nice to

386
00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:35.190
see the, the Sprite started
kicking around. So the dot

387
00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:37.200
P eight files are cute,
but the part that took

388
00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:39.390
me a while, cause I,
cause you, you kind of

389
00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:43.070
casually mentioned it on the
website, but it isn't, but,

390
00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:45.600
and forgive me, it just
isn't immediately obvious what's going

391
00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:48.270
on. I was trying to
figure out how I could

392
00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:52.080
download a cartridge and have
it and possess it and

393
00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:54.930
email it to a friend.
And I was looking for

394
00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:57.180
a download link and I
was trying to figure out

395
00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:59.280
what am I supposed to
right. Click on. And then

396
00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:03.180
it clicked that the PNG
that looks like a little

397
00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:06.600
cartridge, it looks like a
Nintendo switch cartridge. Almost. It

398
00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:08.370
has a little notch on
the side to indicate as

399
00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:11.310
if it's supposed to come
in a certain way. Is

400
00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:16.260
the game itself? The picture
is the game. Yeah. It's

401
00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:19.410
actually, I didn't really think
much of it when I,

402
00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:22.700
when I decided to use
that system. But, but late

403
00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:25.650
later on, it became clear,
you know, how much that

404
00:22:25.650 --> 00:22:30.720
really adds to the feeling
of using a virtual console

405
00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:32.880
thing, because you have these
like, just knowing that they're

406
00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:35.130
there on your desk and
that they look like cartridges

407
00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:39.150
sort of completes the illusion
to some degree. Is it?

408
00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:42.120
So the PNG is a
picture of a cartridge. It

409
00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:44.820
says, PicoWay, it has the
website, it's got the name

410
00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:47.880
of the game. And then
a screenshot of a moment

411
00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:51.960
in time in that particular
game, where is the instruction

412
00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:55.080
set? Where's the, where's the
code? So that the code

413
00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:59.820
is wound into the low
bits of the red, green,

414
00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:04.080
blue, alpha data. And so
one would be great cartridges,

415
00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:08.670
a 32 K block of
just eight bit data. And

416
00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:11.370
so when it writes to
a P eight file, it's

417
00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:13.410
just, you know, writing in
a sort of human readable

418
00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:16.920
text format. But when it's
writing to a PNG file,

419
00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:20.310
it's generating first, it's generating
the theater's. Okay. And then

420
00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:24.030
it's waning that information into
the low bits of the

421
00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:28.020
color data. You just have
enough Slack room. That's not

422
00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:32.670
visibly seen by us because
the PNG isn't filled with

423
00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:35.430
visible into the colors that
you're using or not complex

424
00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:38.730
enough that you needed that
space. So you just squirrel

425
00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:40.740
away the things in that
space. Yep. That's that's right.

426
00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:44.790
So there's in a regular
RGBA image. There are 32

427
00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:48.110
bits available in one pixel.
And so I use eight

428
00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:50.830
of them and you, yeah,
you can't see it Now,

429
00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:53.170
does that w I worried,
and maybe this is where

430
00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:55.450
I know just enough to
be dangerous as my dad

431
00:23:55.450 --> 00:23:58.000
says, I was worried that
in the saving or in

432
00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.130
the transmitting or in the
moving I'm, it might be

433
00:24:00.130 --> 00:24:04.240
lost. Could I, might I
open it into a paintbrush

434
00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:07.510
program and to save it
and ruin it and ruin

435
00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:10.780
the data. So you can,
unfortunately, there are some programs

436
00:24:10.810 --> 00:24:14.890
that, you know, we'll take
the Liberty of missing with

437
00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:17.860
those bits because, you know,
to save space or whatever,

438
00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:21.250
and also especially uploading to
services like Twitter or Facebook,

439
00:24:21.850 --> 00:24:24.760
they're likely to do something
to interest, to the image,

440
00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:27.820
to crunch it smaller. I
see. So then do we

441
00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:31.390
know if tweeting a cartridge
picture destroys its internal data?

442
00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:34.870
It worked at one point
I haven't tried recently. I

443
00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:37.720
think Twitter has, has gradually
been, you know, more aggressive

444
00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:43.810
in reducing image sizes. So
understandably so, you know, PicoWay

445
00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:49.420
cartridges might have been some
collateral damage. Okay. But certainly

446
00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:51.790
emailing them, put driving them,
you know, dragging them out

447
00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:54.640
of a, a browser or
saving them that if, as

448
00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:56.050
long as you don't open
it, mess with it and

449
00:24:56.050 --> 00:24:59.020
save it again in an
optimizing PNG editor. You're probably

450
00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:01.360
okay. Yeah. I haven't heard
of that breaking down yet.

451
00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:05.080
<inaudible> so in the, in
the days and weeks that

452
00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:08.920
I spent messing around with
Pico eight, I, I assume

453
00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:10.630
I went through all of
the stages. I mean, they're

454
00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:13.660
not stages of grief, they're
stages of, of charm. Then

455
00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:16.030
you should probably document these
stages at some point, right.

456
00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:18.550
There's that initial? Like, what
is this thing that I've

457
00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:20.650
discovered? I feel like I've
found a corner of the

458
00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:23.290
internet and I told my
friends about it and there

459
00:25:23.290 --> 00:25:27.160
was a pretty clear 50,
50 split between people who

460
00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:29.260
knew what PicoWay was and
thought that it was amazing.

461
00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:31.540
And where have you been
Scott? You could have, you

462
00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:33.550
could have been with us
all these years playing Pico

463
00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:35.710
eight games. And then the
other half was like, Oh,

464
00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:37.780
that's amazing too. I want
to, I want to do

465
00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:40.030
this as well. And then
the next stage, and we're

466
00:25:40.030 --> 00:25:42.910
in stage three or four
was, I want to physically

467
00:25:42.910 --> 00:25:45.400
take it with me. So
I went and spent days

468
00:25:45.850 --> 00:25:49.660
trying to find the perfect
physical hardware to run this

469
00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:53.740
console on. I don't think
it exists today. Does it?

470
00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:57.670
Yeah. I haven't found a
handheld that I would recommend

471
00:25:57.670 --> 00:26:01.450
as you know, the ideal
machine for Pico eight. And

472
00:26:01.450 --> 00:26:03.340
it depends what people are
using it for as well.

473
00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:07.570
If it's just for, for
playing games, you know, there

474
00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:11.920
are a bunch of reasonable
solutions like the, the what's

475
00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:17.710
it called the clockwork clockwork
play. And It was bundled

476
00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:19.840
with the pocket chip for
awhile there. But the pocket

477
00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:22.630
chip has a beautiful screen.
And with all the respect

478
00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:25.390
to our friends, with the
pocket chip, a lousy keyboard,

479
00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:28.960
yes, I really loved the
pocket chip vision apart from

480
00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:35.020
the keyboard and the screen
was miraculously suitable for <inaudible>,

481
00:26:35.050 --> 00:26:41.950
it was 270 pixels high
against Pico weights, 256. If

482
00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:45.600
you, if you show each
pixel doubled, so you get

483
00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:47.130
some black strips down the
side, but it was actually

484
00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:50.040
pretty good. And you know,
it came with wifi. So

485
00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:52.650
you could interact with the
BBS and things like that.

486
00:26:54.290 --> 00:26:56.690
And the clockwork PI, and
I'm going to have links

487
00:26:56.690 --> 00:26:58.670
to all of this in
the show notes. It's an

488
00:26:58.670 --> 00:27:02.000
interesting open source kind of
portable kit that looks effectively

489
00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.820
like a, an idealized game
boy modularized, and it's it's

490
00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:12.920
close, but unfortunately it's pixels
are not square. Those aren't

491
00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:19.130
square and the resolution is
a little bit awkward. Yeah.

492
00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:20.960
So there's, there's always something
just a little bit off.

493
00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:27.230
I think the, the, the
closest that's currently available is

494
00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:31.220
not a handheld it's arcade
cabinet. The pike aid by

495
00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:34.820
pine Moroni is sipping at
768. So you get perfect

496
00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:38.690
scaling, but the high resolution
models are high enough resolution

497
00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:41.630
that, you know, you can
scale it and not see

498
00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:44.360
the difference. It's, it's, it's
interesting. It's almost part of

499
00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:46.580
its charm that it's not
easily to do to this.

500
00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:49.730
You know, I, I still
feel like I can make

501
00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:51.470
it happen if I look
enough or I find the

502
00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:55.100
right part, or maybe if
we publicly and gently shamed

503
00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:58.160
the clockwork hi people, because
you know, it is a,

504
00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:01.550
it is a console that
is modular. There's only simply

505
00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:06.080
one module per module in,
you know, module type. Maybe

506
00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:08.630
they just need to get
their screen situation under control.

507
00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:12.590
So I don't have serious
ambitions into creating this thing

508
00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:15.770
myself, but I know I,
you know, of course looked

509
00:28:15.770 --> 00:28:19.280
around at hardware suppliers, you
know, just in case to

510
00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:21.740
see what, see whether it
was available. And it is

511
00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:24.650
a very, very awkward resolution.
The first time I looked,

512
00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:31.010
I found the, sorry, I
mean, the very smallest possible

513
00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:36.050
resolution, 128 squared that fits
perfectly one-to-one, there are millions

514
00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:39.140
and millions of surplus screens
that size it's really, you

515
00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:42.320
know, a good deal, a
good choice because they they're

516
00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:47.000
the same as Nakia 4,000
series phones and, you know,

517
00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.520
a bunch of other devices
use them. So there are

518
00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:55.340
some projects like tiny pie
and yeah, I can't remember

519
00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:58.910
off hand what it was
called, but that build little

520
00:29:00.170 --> 00:29:02.270
shells that, you know, just
put some buttons in a

521
00:29:02.270 --> 00:29:06.320
screen and a battery around
the raspberry PI. But the

522
00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:09.740
next biggest screen that I
could find at that time

523
00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:15.170
was the eight K by
eight K like observatory dome

524
00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:20.930
screen that is 40 meters
across. So I really, you

525
00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:23.660
know, that also fits pick
away perfectly, but it's not

526
00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:27.070
very practical and a little
bit too large. So it,

527
00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:29.390
you know, it's pretty hard
to find something square that

528
00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:31.640
that is a power of
two size in the middle.

529
00:29:31.910 --> 00:29:34.610
The tiny pie is very,
very close. It's got the

530
00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:38.210
one 28 by one 28
TFT, but, but then you,

531
00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:40.640
what you, what you get
in screen, you lose in

532
00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:44.080
buttons or mediocre, you know,
it's three D printed case.

533
00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:46.560
I mean, I think that's
the, I think that's the

534
00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:49.680
most sort of viable possibility.
And I, I did walk

535
00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:52.620
around for a number of
months with a mocked up

536
00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:56.640
cardboard Pico out in my
pocket with that screen size,

537
00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:58.320
just so I could pull
it out at random times

538
00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:00.330
and sort of see how
it felt. You know, it's

539
00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:02.310
just do small, if you're
focusing on it, it doesn't

540
00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:07.140
seem that bad, but it's
definitely out for things like

541
00:30:07.290 --> 00:30:09.570
plugging a keyboard in programming
on it, which I think

542
00:30:09.570 --> 00:30:12.420
is a kind of an
important aspect of the machine,

543
00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:14.760
even if it's portable. Well,
it's nice that you're leaving

544
00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:16.680
it to us to figure
out, like you said, this

545
00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:18.870
is a fantasy console and
that's part of the fantasy

546
00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:21.060
is to try to figure
out the perfect way to

547
00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:23.370
carry this around and, and,
and do whatever you want.

548
00:30:23.370 --> 00:30:25.530
And I've got PI, I
have a three D printed

549
00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:27.750
game boy here that I've
got, which is a pie

550
00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:30.300
with a nice screen. I
could probably put Biko eight

551
00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:32.070
on that. I've got a
little one that is a,

552
00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:36.870
a pie girl, which is
the PI GameBoy clone from

553
00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:39.630
ADA fruit. I could potentially
do something with that, but

554
00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:40.980
it does need a machine
with a little bit of

555
00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:43.200
heft because we're, again, we're
not trying to be a

556
00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:46.170
low powered machine, right. This
is not a real, Yeah.

557
00:30:46.170 --> 00:30:49.080
It's, I'm sorry. When I
hit the choice to make

558
00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:52.950
it efficient, you know, when
I was choosing between efficiency

559
00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:58.620
and, you know, design freedom,
it's called, I always chose

560
00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:02.250
design freedom. So, so for
example, I could have sort

561
00:31:02.250 --> 00:31:04.950
of limited the number, the,
the range of features of

562
00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:07.410
Lewer that you could use.
And if I had cut

563
00:31:07.410 --> 00:31:15.810
things like coroutines, and, and
also things like allowing infinite

564
00:31:15.810 --> 00:31:18.300
loops is a subtle one
that I won't go into.

565
00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:21.230
It's quite hard to, if
infinite loops, you know, you

566
00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:23.790
need to be running on
an interpreter rather than compiling

567
00:31:23.790 --> 00:31:27.930
using Git or something like
that. So if I, if

568
00:31:27.930 --> 00:31:30.510
I had chosen those thin,
maybe it could run on

569
00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:33.620
something much lower powered, but
at the moment it needs

570
00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:38.400
around 700 megahertz or something
like that. Oh, wow. So

571
00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:41.940
what, what websites have bounded
Coke have come up around

572
00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:45.450
this? I've seen this thing
called itch.io. These are the,

573
00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:48.360
these different indie game browsing
places. People can get Pico

574
00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:50.520
eight games in other places.
Is that true? Other than

575
00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:52.860
just at your website? Yeah,
I didn't. I wanted to

576
00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:56.190
be sort of an unworldly
garden. So it's, it's very

577
00:31:56.190 --> 00:32:00.630
easy to export to binary,
sand HTML, and so many,

578
00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:04.560
many pig raid games I
released on itch.io. There's more

579
00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:07.320
than a thousand or one
and a half thousand B

580
00:32:07.330 --> 00:32:10.620
great games there. So that
means that I could, as

581
00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:13.350
a, as a consumer download
a great a game that

582
00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:16.200
looks amazing and never really
know at the engine and

583
00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:19.590
the community behind it. So
when you, when you run

584
00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:22.080
a PicoWay game, it still
comes up with the peak

585
00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:25.290
rate food screen. So, you
know, that it's the peak

586
00:32:25.290 --> 00:32:27.480
of that game and it
sort of frames what you're

587
00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:31.350
about to look at. I
think it allows people to

588
00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:34.140
not worry too much about
making super low resolution things,

589
00:32:35.490 --> 00:32:37.230
because, you know, when you
run a pick away game,

590
00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:39.530
you sort of know what
the deal is and it

591
00:32:39.530 --> 00:32:43.330
has this, you know, there's
a reason for it. And

592
00:32:43.570 --> 00:32:47.380
there are a lot of
great zenes and educational tool

593
00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:48.820
sets that are out there.
In fact, I'm going to

594
00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:53.680
have Dylan Bennett who is creating
educational content and game dev

595
00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:55.840
things and doing a lot
of work on Pico eight.

596
00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:59.050
And he's created a really
great PicoWay tool kit and

597
00:32:59.050 --> 00:33:01.660
a, basically a 72 page
Xen on how to do

598
00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:05.170
game development. So you've got
people making amazing tutorials and

599
00:33:05.170 --> 00:33:10.270
algorithm. Step-by-steps doing your, doing
your documentation for you, making

600
00:33:10.270 --> 00:33:12.610
it even easier to learn.
Yeah. He calls it. <inaudible>,

601
00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:15.970
it's really a book. It's
really a nice book, which,

602
00:33:16.570 --> 00:33:18.460
you know, you can, you
can just read it from,

603
00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:21.400
start to finish. And afterwards,
after that, you basically have

604
00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:24.830
all the tools you need
to make it really any,

605
00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:29.110
any game. But I, I
view the, the manual and

606
00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:32.260
the, the user guide, which
aren't finished yet as sort

607
00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:35.920
of part of the, the
whole big rate experience. So

608
00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:39.520
even though there's a great
community of people making documentation

609
00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:42.940
and tutorials. Yeah. I'm, I'm
also, it's a sort of

610
00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:46.720
a nice nostalgic trip for
me trying to do things

611
00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:49.990
like explain variables to somebody
for the first time. And

612
00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:52.590
so it's something I'm enjoying
doing as well as, as

613
00:33:52.870 --> 00:33:57.580
writing, you know, from scratch
tutorials and kind of building

614
00:33:57.580 --> 00:33:59.260
the manual into something that
looks like it could have

615
00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:02.290
been released in the 1980s.
And do you think that

616
00:34:02.290 --> 00:34:04.300
this is something that I
should take to, for example,

617
00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:07.510
to my son's charter school
and teach folks like this

618
00:34:07.510 --> 00:34:11.110
is a great first environment,
it's the new scratch? Why

619
00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:14.830
not, why not teach Pico
eight rather than something else

620
00:34:14.830 --> 00:34:17.710
as a first language for
kids? I think it is

621
00:34:17.710 --> 00:34:22.120
a good fist environment, but
it, you know, scratch does

622
00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:25.540
it a different, a different
job. They have different roles.

623
00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:28.930
And I think <inaudible> role
is kind of, like I

624
00:34:28.930 --> 00:34:32.920
mentioned before is to remove
magic and give, give new

625
00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:36.430
program is the feeling that
they really can just make

626
00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:40.330
anything, you know, to really
so shorter than what it's

627
00:34:40.330 --> 00:34:44.110
like to build a simple
thing from, from nothing. And,

628
00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:46.180
you know, it only takes
five or 10 lanes to

629
00:34:46.180 --> 00:34:49.600
make quite a beautiful, interesting
thing. Yeah. I've even discovered

630
00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:52.330
a community on Twitter, which
are putting Pico eight games

631
00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:55.060
in a tweet and seeing
how fancy and how complicated

632
00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:57.070
it can get and fit
in entirely in one tweet.

633
00:34:57.400 --> 00:35:02.170
Yeah. So Twitter sort of
created a sub sub constraints

634
00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:05.260
genre for be great. And
most of the peak rate

635
00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:08.020
things that I released recently
are also tweet cards. It's

636
00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:12.670
really fun trying to fit
something in 280 characters. Fantastic.

637
00:35:12.670 --> 00:35:14.350
Well, I'm going to include
links to all of this

638
00:35:14.350 --> 00:35:17.620
stuff, to the PicoWay user
manual. The zenes like game

639
00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:21.070
development books from great cheat
sheets, the huge community Wiki.

640
00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:23.590
And I would really encourage
folks that are listening to

641
00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:26.200
go and check this out,
play your Pico eight games,

642
00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:28.270
maybe share them with yourself,
with your friends, with your

643
00:35:28.270 --> 00:35:30.940
family. If you're doing web
development like me and you

644
00:35:30.940 --> 00:35:33.880
spend all day doing text
boxes over data, it can

645
00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:35.710
really be a nice way
to unwind and make a

646
00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:39.270
game in an environment like
Pico eight. I really appreciate

647
00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:41.730
chatting with me today, Joseph.
Oh, thank you very much.

648
00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:45.120
I've been talking with Joseph White,
the creator of Pico eight.

649
00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:48.500
This has been another episode
of Hanselman. We'll see you

650
00:35:48.500 --> 00:36:09.650
again next week. <inaudible>.
