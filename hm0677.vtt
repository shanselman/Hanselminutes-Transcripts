this is Scott Hanselman, Hansel

16
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.550
minutes. And today I'm talking
with Camille 48. She is

17
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.790
head of platform engineering at
two Sigma and the author

18
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.580
of a great new book
called the manager's path. A

19
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.130
guide for tech leaders, navigating
growth and change. It's actually

20
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.800
a number one bestseller in
engineering, project management. How are

21
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.310
you? I'm good. Thanks. How
are you? I'm pretty good.

22
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:26.870
I'm happy to be talking
to you. You just keep

23
00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.600
crushing it everywhere. I'm follow
you on Twitter and I've

24
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.870
been enjoying your book. It's
doing very well. It's been

25
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.990
out for about a year
or so. Yeah, a little

26
00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.710
extra coming up on two
years and in March, April

27
00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.910
timeframe. And how has the
response been? I've heard nothing

28
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:45.920
but nice things and I've
been enjoying it in the

29
00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.340
four chapters that I made.
Yeah. The response has been

30
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.090
really positive. I'm I'm actually,
I sort of wrote it,

31
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.880
hoping that a few people
would like it and I've

32
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.880
been kind of overwhelmed by
the positive response on I'm

33
00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.790
very grateful that I was
able to write something that

34
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.610
so many people find useful.
Have you found in the

35
00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.250
writing of it that it,
that things like this, are

36
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.350
they sell because of marketing
or they sell it because

37
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.180
of word of mouth? I
think in most of the

38
00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.520
cells because of word of
mouth, because there's not really

39
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.820
any marketing. I mean, it's
an O'Reilly publication or Riley

40
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.550
does a little bit, like
they bring your books to

41
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.180
conferences and things like that.
But you know, the only

42
00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.330
marketing that that really happened
was for a while, there

43
00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.420
are people were taking pictures
of my book that they

44
00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.450
brought on vacation, which was
kind of fun and they

45
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.520
would tweet them at me.
And so I would retweet

46
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.010
that. That was like kind
of a weird, like viral

47
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.070
marketing. Well, it's like my
book on like gorgeous beaches.

48
00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.710
Like someone took it to
Fiji and I'm just like,

49
00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.140
really you want to read
about engineering management and Fiji.

50
00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.890
Okay. That's actually kind of
awesome. It shows a commitment

51
00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.740
to the craft. Yeah. Yeah.
But you know, it's mostly

52
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.110
been a word of mouth
book in terms of people

53
00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.710
picking it up. Very cool.
Do you think that people

54
00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:02.400
who are managers are grown
or born, First of all,

55
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.050
everyone has to learn, however,
natural you may be in

56
00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.820
terms of comfortable talking to
people and you know, leading

57
00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.110
them and you know, natural
charisma, whatever there's so much

58
00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.790
of there's so much work.
There's, there's a lot of

59
00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.740
details of the work of
actually being a good manager

60
00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.260
that has really nothing to
do with your personality per

61
00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.710
se, that has to be
learned. So in some sense,

62
00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:30.210
everyone is, is grown into
a good manager. There are

63
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:34.230
probably some personality types that
will have a harder time

64
00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.210
becoming a great manager than
others. I have worked with

65
00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:43.200
people who were managers, but
were also like really, really

66
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.340
good engineers. And sometimes what
I see with those, especially

67
00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.120
when they're struggling to be
managers is a desire to

68
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.240
just go really, really deep
into the technology. You know,

69
00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.450
you're, they're having problems with
their team, perhaps there's, there's,

70
00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.880
you know, collaboration, challenges going
on or projects are missing.

71
00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.940
And instead of taking a
step back and looking at

72
00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.140
the situation broadly, what happens
is that they say, Oh,

73
00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.120
you know what, I'm just
going to like go super,

74
00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.980
super deep into the technology
and I'm going to, you

75
00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.160
know, shut the world out
and, and look at it

76
00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.710
from that side of things.
And if that is really

77
00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:22.200
your desire and instinct, and
you can kind of get

78
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.870
over that even after perhaps
having it pointed out to

79
00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.600
you that this is not
the ideal thing for a

80
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.910
manager to be doing in
this circumstance. It may be

81
00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.710
as a sign that like
you would just be happier

82
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.150
and more successful focusing on
the individual contributor work, instead

83
00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.880
of trying to really, you
know, keep it, that kind

84
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.280
of higher level. I'm looking
across a bunch of people,

85
00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.120
which is what the manager
needs to do. It's interesting

86
00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.420
to explore the personality types,
because like you, like you

87
00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.250
said, you could say that
a personality type is a

88
00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.040
natural leader, but it's really
that they have characteristics underneath,

89
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.100
underneath that like maybe characteristics
of empathy or seeing the

90
00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.670
big picture or whatever that
would then be part of

91
00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:02.550
the formula. They're not necessarily
a natural leader, but it's

92
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.320
part of the formula that
would make them an effective

93
00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.700
manager. But what is it
about technologists that somehow make

94
00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.640
us want to like people
don't compile? So we'll just,

95
00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.680
like you said, I'll just
hide in the code because,

96
00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.500
well, at least I understand
that part. I mean, I

97
00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.300
just think it's, I think
it's sort of natural, right?

98
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.480
People always go to what
they're good at when they're

99
00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.890
under stress. For the most
part is just my, you

100
00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.020
know, my, my observations true
of myself. It's true of

101
00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.020
almost everyone. If you, if
you watch someone who is

102
00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.740
really stressed out often their
first instinct is to go

103
00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.230
where they feel comfortable. And
so for a lot of

104
00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:40.050
engineers, especially those who are
new to management, they feel

105
00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:43.350
comfortable in the code or
maybe they feel comfortable debugging

106
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:46.050
things or, you know, helping
out with operations or whatever.

107
00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.350
And I think that that's
totally, you know, it was

108
00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:52.470
totally a natural thing to
do, but unfortunately it doesn't,

109
00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.960
it's not actually the job
anymore. Right? So your, your

110
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.650
job has now changed to
something new. And, and I

111
00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.110
think that some people can
get over that and can

112
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.860
force themselves to be uncomfortable
in that uncomfortable learning phase

113
00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:05.090
of like, I don't know
what I'm doing as a

114
00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:06.920
manager and I'm doing a
bunch of stuff that I

115
00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.980
don't feel that good at
and just continuing to work

116
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:12.110
on that and eventually getting
good at it. And some

117
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:15.020
people just continually refuse to
do that and just continue

118
00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.510
to go back to the
code or to their, to

119
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:20.030
their comfort zone. And, you
know, as a result don't

120
00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:23.500
really grow out of that.
Have you ever found yourself

121
00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.910
in a situation where perhaps
someone that you were, that

122
00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:30.670
was your direct, that you're
the manager and you have

123
00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:33.310
people who work for you
and you have identified that

124
00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:34.630
one or more of the
people who work for you

125
00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:37.600
are probably going to be
better at being the manager

126
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.820
than you are. Because I
find myself sometimes in that

127
00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:42.400
situation where I'm like, you
know, so and so who

128
00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.040
works for me really should
have my job. So I

129
00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:49.150
actually have someone working for
me now, although he is

130
00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:52.390
going to go be a,
a VP at a startup

131
00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:54.850
soon, and I'm very happy
for him who was probably

132
00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:59.200
the best manager I've ever
worked with. And, you know,

133
00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:02.530
I'm, I was thrilled to
be able to work with

134
00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:06.790
him. And I was his
manager. He definitely, you know,

135
00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.670
I think in a lot
of ways was better at

136
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:14.020
some things that I was,
and, you know, so that

137
00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:17.230
was actually a joy really,
honestly, it's, it's really fun

138
00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.650
working with someone who's just
like really, really good at

139
00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:22.570
something that you also care
a lot about and are

140
00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:29.350
really interested in. And I
enjoyed that. So from that,

141
00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:33.460
so I have had that
experience and I'm very happy

142
00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:35.740
for him that he's going
to do something new and

143
00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:38.170
exciting, and I'm very excited
to be able to keep

144
00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:40.630
in touch with him and,
you know, continue to like

145
00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.720
both share stuff that I
know and, and resources that

146
00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:46.120
I can give to him
and also learn from him

147
00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:48.820
and learn from what he's
experiencing. You know, I think,

148
00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:53.920
especially at the level that
I'm at now, you know,

149
00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:56.110
every manager and leader is
a little bit different and

150
00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:59.470
has, has, you know, you
can, you can fit into

151
00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:04.420
a particular niche that other
people wouldn't necessarily fit into

152
00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:07.810
that. Well, even though they're
stronger than you at other

153
00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:11.380
areas. Right. So, you know,
so I think he was

154
00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:13.180
a stronger manager than I
am. And I think perhaps

155
00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:16.240
someday I would work for
him. On the other hand,

156
00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:18.160
you know, there were, there
are things that I have

157
00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.290
done that he's never had
the chance to do yet.

158
00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:22.930
Right. Like I've been a
CTO and I am very

159
00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:29.500
comfortable with the management work
of, of leading, leading an

160
00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:34.990
organization and thinking about a
lot of the HR processes

161
00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:36.730
of sitting at a table
with a lot of other

162
00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:41.530
executives and, and really presenting
well, you know, with them

163
00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:43.270
kind of, you know, how
do you talk to those

164
00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:47.050
people? What does that executive
presence like that, you know,

165
00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:49.300
it's just not things that
he had necessarily had a

166
00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:53.920
lot of opportunities to do
yet. So, so I, I

167
00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:57.350
guess that's, that's, that's a
long winded answer, right? And

168
00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:59.010
you could definitely have people
who work for you, who

169
00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:01.770
you think ultimately are better
than you at some of

170
00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:03.870
the aspects of the job
and they just need to

171
00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:05.910
learn it. And I think
as a manager, part of

172
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:08.220
your job is actually to
like give them those opportunities,

173
00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:11.610
look for those opportunities for
them. And then, you know,

174
00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.530
keep in touch with them
when they go off to

175
00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:15.330
do something great. Cause you
never know who your next

176
00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:19.970
boss will be. Yeah. I
appreciate that. Very, very thoughtful

177
00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:22.220
answer. I know that was
kind of a tough question

178
00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:25.070
because it is quite nuanced.
You know, someone's not necessarily

179
00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:27.950
better than you or worse
than you. I mean, we

180
00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:30.770
are the collection of our
experiences, but I am always,

181
00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.660
you know, I've been in
tech for a very long

182
00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:35.780
time, but I am always
so impressed when young people

183
00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:38.900
pick up things so quickly.
And so intuitively that I

184
00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:42.470
found that I found to
be hard won skills, particularly

185
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:43.670
one in like trying to
be a lead or a

186
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:49.640
tech lead there's within that
chapter three of your book,

187
00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:51.560
you start talking about the
idea of being a tech

188
00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:54.530
lead and I've, I've seen
an interesting article go around

189
00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:57.590
the net recently that made
the, the interesting observation that

190
00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:01.760
being a tech leader, being
a principal software engineer, isn't

191
00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:06.710
senior, senior, like the tech
lead doesn't necessarily the smartest

192
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:09.860
person in the room. Yeah.
Yes. I absolutely believe that.

193
00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:14.630
Yeah, no, I've read that
article and it's great in

194
00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:18.260
technical companies, we often just
wrap a lot of things

195
00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.050
up together that don't need
to be wrapped up together.

196
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:23.240
So I think there's a
lot, we do this thing

197
00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.910
where we want, we want
our leaders, or we want

198
00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:28.340
people in these positions to
be the best at everything.

199
00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:31.100
Like, you know, they should
be the smartest person in

200
00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:34.670
the room, the most technical,
the best talker, the best,

201
00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:39.020
you know, just everything and
those people don't, most people

202
00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:41.780
just don't have all of
those skills. And so then

203
00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:44.120
we often say, okay, well,
if I have to pick

204
00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:47.630
one, I'm going to go
for smartest slash most technical

205
00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:52.430
because that's, you know, that's
who I know the team

206
00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:55.340
will respect the, you know,
the core that they know

207
00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:57.170
how to do the core
work really, really well. Cause

208
00:10:57.170 --> 00:11:01.580
they're the most technical, but
you know, when the job

209
00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:08.150
isn't actually about doing the
most difficult technical work, putting

210
00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:11.090
the most technical person in
the job may not be

211
00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:14.090
the right thing to do.
I think the tech lead

212
00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:15.560
job, and I talk about
this in my book. I

213
00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:18.980
think a lot of the
tech lead job is there's

214
00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:21.110
a large amount of project
management in it. There's a

215
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:23.300
lot of, there's a large
amount of how am I

216
00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:28.040
helping a group of people
get something done effectively. And

217
00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:31.310
as an engineer and working
on engineering projects, a lot

218
00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:33.710
of that work is technical
work. So you do need

219
00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:36.620
to be technically savvy and
you need to understand the

220
00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:39.470
technologies that you're building with
and, you know, and be

221
00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:42.200
able to think about the
system. But that does not

222
00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.990
mean you're the best programmer
that does not, you know,

223
00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:48.680
that, that doesn't actually necessarily
mean that, that, you know,

224
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:52.880
like every single nitty gritty
detail of every single part

225
00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:56.290
of system, it just means
that you are capable of

226
00:11:56.620 --> 00:12:00.220
joining all those pieces together
and, and importantly, helping that

227
00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:05.470
team or together effectively. And
I think, you know, whether

228
00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:09.820
or not you're managing people
at levels of leadership, almost

229
00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:13.780
everyone needs those skills to
continue to become a leader.

230
00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:17.110
There are very, very few
people in the world who

231
00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:20.470
can shut themselves away and
change the world just by

232
00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:24.040
writing code by themselves. There
are a couple of people

233
00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:27.100
like that. That's true. They're
all there. Everyone looks around

234
00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:31.510
and they see these exceptions,
Linus, Torvalds, perhaps, right? But

235
00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:35.530
for most of us that
just, you know, you have

236
00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:38.320
to be in the exact
right place at the exact

237
00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:42.400
right time. You have to
be such an exotic place.

238
00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:43.660
Things every time is a
big part of it. You

239
00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:47.710
maybe also need really exceptional
skills. And there's just not

240
00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:50.110
that many opportunities like that.
For most of us working

241
00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:55.450
at companies, what makes you
really successful is that you're

242
00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:57.880
actually able to get a
lot of people to do

243
00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:01.210
things, to create big things.
And what do you do

244
00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:04.480
that by managing them by,
by leading them, by coaching

245
00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:06.370
them and teaching them, there's
a lot of different ways.

246
00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:09.560
It doesn't have to be
a management job, but the,

247
00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:14.050
the role of senior technical
leadership is about other people

248
00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:15.700
it's about leading or you
can't lead. If there's no

249
00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:19.390
people to lead, it's not
about shutting yourself away and

250
00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:21.490
writing a lot of code
and writing the most code

251
00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:25.690
of anyone in the company.
That's just very rarely the

252
00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:29.200
skill that's gonna be, you
know, the most impactful. So,

253
00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:33.550
so I, you know, I
do think that that tech

254
00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:35.110
leadership, you know, it doesn't
have to be the most

255
00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:37.620
technical person on the team
taking the tech job. And

256
00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:40.270
in fact, a lot of
technical people wouldn't necessarily like

257
00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:43.990
to have to do that
because there's so much project

258
00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:48.940
management and, and not exactly
purely technical responsibilities to making

259
00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:53.190
that job successful On your
blog. You make the very

260
00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:56.820
important point that ultimately if
the engineering manager is not

261
00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:59.700
good at getting the team
to be productive, then that

262
00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:02.550
is a problem. So, I
mean, shut up and ship

263
00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:04.230
is kind of what I'm
hearing there. You really have

264
00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:05.880
to ship otherwise, you're going
to fail in those areas.

265
00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:10.920
Yeah. I, again, unless, you
know, maybe if you are

266
00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:13.170
a researcher, you have a
little bit, you know, your

267
00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:15.570
timeframe of shipping is different.
Most of us are not

268
00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:19.080
researchers and even researchers about
a shift. I mean, you

269
00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:21.120
know, academics, I've got to
get those papers published. If

270
00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:24.810
they want to make tenure
Microsoft, where I work, they

271
00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:26.430
have this term. And I'm
not sure yet if it's

272
00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:29.850
a Microsoft ism or if
it's a everyone ism, but

273
00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:31.770
the term M one and
M two, have you ever

274
00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:36.450
heard that? I have maybe
her, some companies, these are

275
00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:39.330
like management levels, right? Well,
some more like, are you

276
00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:42.330
a manager of some people,
or are you a manager

277
00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:45.360
of managers? And you actually
have a whole chapter in

278
00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:48.000
your book about managing managers.
When I saw that, I

279
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.880
said, Oh, those are <inaudible>
managers that manage managers of,

280
00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:53.960
and you know, when you
get an extra level nested

281
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:57.350
deep, it sounds pretty exhausting.
And it's a whole new

282
00:14:57.350 --> 00:15:03.280
level of complexity. Yes, it
is. You know, to explain

283
00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:07.000
it to engineers. I often
say you, you have this

284
00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.510
level of abstraction, a new
level of abstraction that you,

285
00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:13.450
you may or may not
be able to Pierce that

286
00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:16.870
is all about what's going
on in this team. So,

287
00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:19.510
you know, the, when you're
initially managing, especially if you're

288
00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:22.510
a technical person and you
were maybe even a developer

289
00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:25.930
on the team that you
started to manage, you have

290
00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:29.230
just this kind of native
understanding of the software. You

291
00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:31.840
have this native understanding of
the way things work and

292
00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:33.940
that's, that can take you,
that can make the job

293
00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:36.700
of management a lot easier
because you just have good

294
00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:39.490
technical instincts. And you can
kind of know if people

295
00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:42.040
are working on the right
things or not. Once you

296
00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:44.890
go up levels of abstraction
and you are no longer

297
00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:47.680
really directly talking to the
people that are working on

298
00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:50.560
the code or working on
the systems that often, and

299
00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:52.990
maybe even furthermore, you never
worked on those systems at

300
00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:55.570
all. And you're just talking
to the manager of that

301
00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:57.220
team. And you're really just
getting what that person is,

302
00:15:57.220 --> 00:16:02.410
reflecting back to you. That
is a very challenging thing

303
00:16:02.410 --> 00:16:04.840
to figure out. It's very
challenging to figure out how

304
00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.870
do I continue to know
if this team is doing

305
00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:11.980
well or not in that,
in that scenario? How do

306
00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:14.860
I Pierce that level of
instruction? Or how much should

307
00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:18.640
I even do that? Yeah.
You, in, in the book,

308
00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:20.950
you have this quote, you
actually quote yourself, which I

309
00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:23.170
think is great, because it
was an email that you

310
00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:25.900
sent to your leadership coach,
and you're saying to them,

311
00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.180
how do you help with
problems that you weren't in

312
00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:31.300
the room to see? And
I love this with unreliable

313
00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:34.510
witnesses. Sometimes I feel like
I'm constantly piecing together, you

314
00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:37.000
know, stories about like, well,
what did they say? What's

315
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.010
the technical problem of what's
going on? And you said

316
00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:41.380
that you were spending all
your time to two levels

317
00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:44.350
deep in people problems, and
it's exhausting, but you have

318
00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:46.450
to trust your people. Like
how do you find that

319
00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:49.540
balance? You know, I, I,
I would say like, I'm

320
00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:52.840
still learning new ways to
do that. It's, it's hard.

321
00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:56.440
Do you do have to
trust your people? And so

322
00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:59.770
everybody has like different approaches
to doing this. Some people

323
00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:03.280
are really, really organized. So
you do see those managers

324
00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:07.150
who like, you know, they
really love JIRA and they

325
00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:11.710
will like really, they will
set very clear, like, you

326
00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:14.110
know, project milestones or whatever.
And they will really follow

327
00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:18.490
along with the, with the
progress of the project. And

328
00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:22.420
I think I just can't
do that, honestly, like both,

329
00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:24.520
like I don't, I don't
really like being managed that

330
00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:29.200
way. And I don't have
the patience for that even

331
00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:32.380
as like a manager of
managers. So, so, you know,

332
00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.390
there are people who do
it that way, I think,

333
00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:36.670
and that can work. There
are projects for whom that

334
00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:37.990
can work. And if you
have that kind of attention

335
00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:39.820
span and you can figure
out a way to do

336
00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:41.860
that, that won't make your
team feel like they're just

337
00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:44.560
drowning and bureaucracy. Great. Right.
And I do know people

338
00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:49.920
who successfully manage that way
for me. I, I do

339
00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:53.250
like a combination of things.
My, my general philosophy at

340
00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:57.000
this point is that my
goal is to make sure

341
00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:00.720
that I have as clear
in my mind, what is

342
00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:04.170
really important for my organization
to be doing what are

343
00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:08.340
the really important things for
us to be accomplishing or

344
00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:14.580
stabilizing getting done and keeping
those top of my mind.

345
00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:16.650
And then top of my
manager's mind, and then getting

346
00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:18.750
those managers to keep those
top of their manager's mind

347
00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:23.430
so that if nothing else,
like I'm just trying to

348
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:28.290
push prioritization implicitly through the
org, by helping them know

349
00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:30.900
what I think is important
because people do generally want

350
00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:35.310
to make their boss happy.
They do generally want to

351
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.900
want to be working on
important things. And so, and

352
00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:41.550
I think it's a full
time job understanding what's really

353
00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:43.950
important right now and what
we need to do and,

354
00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:46.710
and pushing that through an
Oregon. That's, that's kind of

355
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:54.450
the way for me that
I, these days lead now

356
00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:57.270
that doesn't solve, you know,
that doesn't really solve the

357
00:18:57.270 --> 00:19:00.300
people problems, right? There's, there's
also a, an element of,

358
00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:02.340
you have to learn how
to train managers, to be

359
00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:04.380
a manager of managers. You
have to learn how to

360
00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:07.770
teach people how to deal
with people problems. You have

361
00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:10.770
to learn how to teach
people how to do all

362
00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:14.250
the various basic management tasks
and become more and more

363
00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:18.900
independent than so, as you're
onboarding new managers, especially people

364
00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:21.210
who have never managed before.
A lot of the job

365
00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:25.370
is teaching them how to
do their job. Well, This

366
00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:29.210
episode is sponsored by stack
overflow for teams, a private

367
00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:32.930
secure home for your team's
questions and answers. It's everything

368
00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:35.930
that you love about stack
overflow now for your company

369
00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:39.620
and get instant, reliable answers
from your coworkers without disrupting

370
00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:43.940
them unlike documentation or wikis,
long email threads, or distracting

371
00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:47.000
instant messages, Q and a
mimics the way that we

372
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.230
naturally share and find information,
introduce stack overflow for teams

373
00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:54.230
to your company, and start
building products faster and better

374

375
00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:05.510
S dot T K slash
Hansel minutes. You, you call

376
00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:09.860
out an interesting juxtaposition between
the CTO, having an open

377
00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:12.290
door policy. You always want,
you always get that speech

378
00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:14.090
when you're joining a company.
And the CTO is in

379
00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:15.800
front of everyone saying, you
know, my door's always open.

380
00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:17.510
And it's like, well, which
of us is going to

381
00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:19.880
be bold enough to go
and get beat up by

382
00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:22.910
the boss or our process
boss. But then you also

383
00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:25.430
call out the importance of
skip level meetings when someone's

384
00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:29.570
talking to their bosses boss
in a formal. Yes, well,

385
00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:32.480
so, so I am a
big believer in skip level

386
00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:36.270
meetings. I still do them.
I still do them. I

387
00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:41.030
always do them. So, so
I, my, my feeling with

388
00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:45.200
the open door policy is
mostly that just people don't

389
00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:48.610
really take advantage of it.
That it's a, you know,

390
00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:52.480
a lot of managers, senior
managers, particular think that if

391
00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:57.010
they set this up, that
people will come to them

392
00:20:57.010 --> 00:21:00.130
when things are going wrong.
And therefore they're not responsible

393
00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:04.510
for actively monitoring the organization
as it were. They can

394
00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:08.350
have this passive monitoring because
people will just bubble up

395
00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:10.810
problems to them. And therefore,
if they're not hearing anything,

396
00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:14.590
everything's fine. And the truth
of the matter is there

397
00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:17.470
are a few people who
will do that and hold

398
00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:21.430
those people dear to your
heart, because those squeaky wheels

399
00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:24.490
can be kind of annoying
sometimes, or, you know, kind

400
00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:27.190
of frustrating, but they are
giving you information. That's so

401
00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:31.360
hard to get otherwise, you
know, you are, you actually

402
00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:33.940
need to figure out what
your active monitoring strategy is

403
00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:36.580
for your organization. And skip
walls are a pretty good

404
00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:39.040
way to do that. So,
you know, talking to the

405
00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:41.350
people in your team who
do not report to you

406
00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:46.300
and on some kind of
regular cadence and just getting,

407
00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:48.460
getting thoughts from them about
what's going well and what

408
00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:51.400
isn't, and letting them trying
to, first of all, like

409
00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:53.860
a really important part of
skip levels is really just

410
00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:56.500
making them feel comfortable with
you. So if something goes

411
00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:59.980
really, really bad, hopefully sometimes
they will be willing to

412
00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:02.710
come to you with it
instead of just quitting or,

413
00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:05.890
you know, what have you.
So there, there is that

414
00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:07.990
like breaking the ice and,
and kind of creating an

415
00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:10.570
actual relationship with the members
of your team that you

416
00:22:10.570 --> 00:22:13.960
may not otherwise interact with
all that often. But then

417
00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:17.080
beyond that, you know, you
are trying to get some

418
00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:20.050
information about what's going on.
That I might, what's, what's

419
00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:22.750
a different perspective on this
team or this organization that

420
00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:25.510
I may not be getting
from my manager. So that

421
00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:29.980
helps you, helps you independently
verify the condition of the

422
00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:33.970
team based on your own
experience with the team, instead

423
00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:37.210
of just entirely relying on
the self reports that your

424
00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:40.020
managers are giving you about.
What's going on. One of

425
00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:42.630
the things that I particularly
appreciated about this chapter, and

426
00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:45.420
I think is important for
people to understand is that

427
00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:49.170
people behave differently in different
contexts. So you call out

428
00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:51.960
of course, the benefit of
skips and skip level meetings

429
00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:54.900
and one-on-ones, but then you
say, well, if your organization

430
00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:57.960
gets really loud, okay, it
gets really large. All you

431
00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:59.880
would be doing is getting
one-on-one. So then you should

432
00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:03.420
consider maybe having skipped level
lunches with whole teams. And

433
00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:05.070
what I appreciated about the
book was that you actually

434
00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:07.890
call out low, that people
will behave differently in a

435
00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:10.770
group dynamic. If you are
putting them in a group

436
00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:13.080
with people that they know
or people that they work

437
00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:15.840
with, or people of their,
of their shared level, there's

438
00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:18.990
lots of different configurations. And
you have to recognize that

439
00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:22.350
everyone is going to behave
somewhat differently and code switch

440
00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:24.630
for lack of a better
word in those instances. And

441
00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:27.450
you as the manager or
the CTO have to be,

442
00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:29.910
be conscious of that, of
that context, that they may

443
00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:33.180
not even be conscious of.
I mean, you know, my,

444
00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:35.970
the organization I'm in now,
so my team is around

445
00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:39.450
a hundred people. And so
I it's, it's big enough

446
00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:41.160
that I can, it's not
so big that I can't

447
00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:44.760
have skip levels with everyone,
but, you know, not very

448
00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:49.310
often. And then we try
to do actual lunches for

449
00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:53.390
all senior leadership across all
of engineering. And so we

450
00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:55.820
will do these like small,
like with a lunch or,

451
00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:59.360
or breakfast or whatever coffee
meetings with, let's say 10

452
00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:01.790
people in the organization. And
two of the senior leaders

453
00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:05.510
at my level. And, you
know, it's been, it's an

454
00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:09.620
interesting experience because I think
the goal is for people

455
00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:13.400
to feel like they're getting
a FaceTime with senior leadership

456
00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:16.250
and they're getting perspectives on
the organization. It is a

457
00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:18.470
little bit like pulling teeth
though, to get people in

458
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:23.090
those rooms to actually ask
questions and, and really engage.

459
00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:25.640
It actually takes a lot
of moderation on the part

460
00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:28.790
of the senior leaders in
the room to, to create

461
00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:31.940
a good conversation. It's definitely
not just something that always

462
00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:36.430
naturally happens. You yourself are
highly technical. And I saw

463
00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:38.680
a video of you where
you wrote your own distributed

464
00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:41.290
system in the early two
thousands before things started becoming

465
00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:44.110
kind of commoditized. And I
wonder what you think about

466
00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:48.550
devs who prefer to work
with technical leaders versus the

467
00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:51.640
kind of inherent suspicion that
we have when we're given

468
00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:53.980
a leader who isn't kind
of like, quote, unquote, one

469
00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:57.310
of us who didn't write
code back in the day,

470
00:24:57.730 --> 00:25:00.730
someone who's more of a
manager manage our career manager.

471
00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:04.780
And if that's problematic, I
mean, a big part of

472
00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:07.000
the thesis of my book
is that I do think

473
00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:11.590
effective engineering management is a
technical discipline that does not

474
00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:15.430
always mean that the best
managers are people who spent

475
00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:18.790
a long time writing code.
I do no exceptions to

476
00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:20.890
this fact. I have, you
know, I have, I have

477
00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:25.090
met people who were involved
in technology in not direct

478
00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:29.020
hands on ways who are
still effective engineering managers. I

479
00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:31.570
think they're pretty rare. And
I think it very much

480
00:25:31.570 --> 00:25:34.240
depends kind of on the
scope of your job and

481
00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:37.390
what you're and what you're
doing. You know, there's, there's

482
00:25:37.390 --> 00:25:42.520
just so much of leadership.
And so much of leadership

483
00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:47.140
and management in engineering is,
is about kind of knowing

484
00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:49.480
really what's important to do
and what you can let

485
00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:52.750
drop. Cause there's always just
too much to do. And

486
00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:57.700
you have to be able
to gut check what your

487
00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.990
engineers are bringing to you
a little bit, like, you

488
00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:04.510
know, you're never going to,
the more senior you get,

489
00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:07.840
right? You're not like looking
at their code and, you

490
00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:10.870
know, picking it apart. But
if you have really like

491
00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:17.320
no instincts about the way
that if you have really

492
00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:19.750
like no instincts about the
way that systems are built,

493
00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:22.540
it can be hard, I
think, to ask the right

494
00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:26.860
questions and make sure that
your team is, is really

495
00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:32.170
taking you in the right
direction. So I do, you

496
00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:34.300
know, so, so that's hard.
That's part of it, right?

497
00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:36.730
I actually just think, you
know, as an engineering leader,

498
00:26:36.730 --> 00:26:38.530
it's actually just hard to
do your job. If you

499
00:26:38.530 --> 00:26:41.980
really don't speak their language
at all. I also think

500
00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:44.310
that there is a level
of like engineers, don't always

501
00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:49.350
respect nontechnical leaders. And so,
you know, people like to

502
00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:55.560
feel like their manager can
do their job. In fact,

503
00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:58.440
this is like a, a
studied thing, right? So there

504
00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:00.690
was I've, I've cited this
in a bunch of talks

505
00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:02.130
because of when I read
it, I was like, wow,

506
00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:04.890
there's an HBR article. And
some people did some research

507
00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:06.990
and they were like, they
asked a bunch of people.

508
00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:10.160
What, what are the top
things that you, you, that

509
00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:13.200
you care about in your
job? And they actually said

510
00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:17.280
having a manager who has
some sort of excellence or

511
00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:21.660
authority in the work that
I do scored higher even

512
00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:24.750
than like more money for
a lot of people. So

513
00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:28.380
it's, I do think that
people care about feeling like

514
00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:32.880
their manager can appreciate what
they're doing and understands, you

515
00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:34.920
know, understands the challenges of
their job. And they can

516
00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:37.350
talk to their manager. They
can get ideas about how

517
00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:40.320
to do their job better
from their manager. So now

518
00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:43.500
this doesn't mean that like
every, you know, every person,

519
00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:45.720
you know, into, in three,
whatever, I don't know if

520
00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:47.880
you, if you term it
that way at Microsoft or

521
00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:50.550
not, but this doesn't mean
that, you know, then you're

522
00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:54.330
a manager of managers and
you're, you know, multiple levels

523
00:27:54.330 --> 00:27:56.700
up and you need to
know and understand every single

524
00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:59.400
detail of every person's work.
Right? It doesn't mean that

525
00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:02.100
you should expect to be
able to do the IC

526
00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:06.180
job at the, at the,
the leaf node when you've

527
00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:08.820
been managing for 15 years.
But it does mean that

528
00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:11.640
you should have enough technical
chops to be able to,

529
00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:15.540
to give decent technical feedback
to your managers as they

530
00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:18.090
are, then have a little
bit more context and a

531
00:28:18.090 --> 00:28:21.390
little bit more technical depth
at the time to give

532
00:28:21.390 --> 00:28:25.500
feedback to their teams. So
I do think that I

533
00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:29.640
do think that for most
people having a good, strong

534
00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:33.120
technical underpinning will generally make
their careers more successful as

535
00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:35.790
managers, because it'll be easier
to gain that respect and

536
00:28:35.790 --> 00:28:39.110
just easier to do the
job. Yeah, absolutely. I feel

537
00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:42.920
that my boss is good
at BS detection. You know,

538
00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:45.620
like he's not necessarily the
most technical, but he's like,

539
00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:48.260
eh, my sense of smell,
my technical sense of smell

540
00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:50.420
sells says that this thing
you're describing may be a

541
00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:54.410
problem. He's got that experience
in your chapter, on managing

542
00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:57.200
people. You have an interesting
quote from Mark Hedlund, where

543
00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:59.900
he says that when people
become a new engineering manager,

544
00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:04.160
like when, when, when an
engineer becomes promoted, they shouldn't

545
00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:06.110
think of it as a
promotion. Like they do. We

546
00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:08.930
all say, Oh, I've been
promoted. Now I'm a manager.

547
00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:12.680
He says that new manager
is an entry level job

548
00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:15.650
because, and you really need
to start with it in

549
00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:18.530
that attitude that I am
now shifting. And maybe I

550
00:29:18.530 --> 00:29:21.980
moved diagonally, but I didn't
necessarily. Yeah. And you know,

551
00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:26.390
I generally speaking, I agree
with that. I think I

552
00:29:26.390 --> 00:29:28.670
do think people go a
little too far when they

553
00:29:28.670 --> 00:29:32.270
say that you're, it's completely
completely different job because I

554
00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:35.300
think that people, yeah. Cause
I think sometimes people hear

555
00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:37.670
that and then they think,
Oh, well then why do

556
00:29:37.670 --> 00:29:39.590
we need technical people to
be managers? And for all

557
00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:42.190
the reasons that I just
said, I actually think you

558
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:45.940
are building on skills. You've
already built those, those skills

559
00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:48.640
that you already built come
in useful. But I do

560
00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:51.370
agree that it is a
very, very different job. And

561
00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:54.700
sometimes having a hard reset
is the thing you need

562
00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:57.490
to do to get good
at it. Because, you know,

563
00:29:57.490 --> 00:30:00.280
as I said earlier, right,
it's very tempting. I think

564
00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:06.190
for new managers to go
back to individual contributor habits

565
00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:09.940
when they're stuck with problems,
right? So they, they tend

566
00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:12.460
to use what's in their
old toolbox to solve problems.

567
00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:14.920
Oh, this project is shipping
late. I'm going to contribute

568
00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:20.230
code, you know, Oh, this,
this person is unhappy. I'm

569
00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:24.100
going to like pair program
with them, whatever. Right. And

570
00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:27.640
you do want to force
yourself to say, I'm not

571
00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:30.280
going to try not to
go back to my individual

572
00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:33.580
contributor toolbox. I'm going to
try to, you know, learn

573
00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:35.260
new things and do things
that are harder for me

574
00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:38.620
or uncomfortable, you know, dig
into the details of the

575
00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:41.710
project from a higher level.
Instead of just assuming that

576
00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:44.470
I can do a dieting
save by adding code myself.

577
00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:47.710
And, and so I do
think that that is a,

578
00:30:47.710 --> 00:30:50.890
it's useful to reframe it
as like a fresh start,

579
00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:54.670
because hopefully it will help
you understand both that this

580
00:30:54.670 --> 00:30:55.900
is going to be hard.
It's going to be a

581
00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:58.330
lot harder than it might
look from the outside. And

582
00:30:58.330 --> 00:31:00.160
also that you should be
trying to do new things

583
00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:02.350
instead of just doing things
that you had done in

584
00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:06.900
the past that you know,
are easy for you, You,

585
00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:08.580
you, you had a blog
post a while back where

586
00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:10.950
you talk about the failure
to delegate can be a

587
00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:13.290
problem. If you're trying, you
know, like basically when being

588
00:31:13.290 --> 00:31:17.100
helpful is actually hurting, like
something that feels intuitive may

589
00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:19.140
not necessarily be intuitive when
you really just want your

590
00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:21.630
team to be happy and
successful, but you also personally

591
00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:24.900
want to feel useful and
needed. Yes. Yes. I think,

592
00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:28.890
you know, sometimes managers will
hold on to uncomf unpleasant

593
00:31:28.890 --> 00:31:32.100
work themselves and they'll say,
Oh, I'm not going to

594
00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:35.850
make my team deal with
this old crufty system. I

595
00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:38.670
will handle on call for
that system. Or, you know,

596
00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:40.830
they don't want to do
this. They don't want to

597
00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:43.080
deal with the release process
or they don't want to

598
00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:47.280
deal with, you know, talking
to this product manager, who's

599
00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:49.290
giving them trouble. So I'm
just going to take all

600
00:31:49.290 --> 00:31:53.070
of those unpleasant things and
do them myself, and what

601
00:31:53.910 --> 00:31:56.430
can happen with that when
you take all of the

602
00:31:56.430 --> 00:31:59.430
unpleasant things and always do
them yourself, is that your

603
00:31:59.430 --> 00:32:02.070
team doesn't have the opportunity
to see where the problems

604
00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:06.240
are and, and create fixes
for them. And you probably

605
00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:09.090
don't have the time to
actually create sustainable fixes for,

606
00:32:09.490 --> 00:32:12.480
for problems like that. Right.
But where, where automation might

607
00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:15.210
actually just make that on-call
problem go away or that

608
00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:17.610
release problem go away or
where you may just need

609
00:32:17.970 --> 00:32:20.280
the engineers to see that
this old crafty system is,

610
00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:22.800
is crufty. And perhaps we
need to think about how

611
00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:25.710
we're going to replace it
with something new. They're not

612
00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:28.410
going to see that because
you're just, you're, you're, you're

613
00:32:28.410 --> 00:32:33.150
hiding it away from them.
I also think that people,

614
00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:36.210
you know, there can be
a great tendency from some

615
00:32:36.210 --> 00:32:38.940
engineering managers, particularly new ones,
but not just new ones,

616
00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:42.470
but just really want to
keep engineer's happy. They just

617
00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:45.950
have this idea that, you
know, the terrified of people

618
00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:48.500
leaving and that their job
is just to make their

619
00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:52.730
team happy all the time.
And that's just as not,

620
00:32:53.150 --> 00:32:55.820
you will not be successful
if that is your, is

621
00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:58.010
that as your attitude going
in, you will, in the

622
00:32:58.010 --> 00:33:00.620
long run, I think you're
going to have a really

623
00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:04.340
hard time being successful because
actually a lot of people,

624
00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:07.280
you know, they kind of
don't respect that and they

625
00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:09.950
don't realize that they don't
respect it, but they end

626
00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:13.010
up more unhappy when they
feel like they're never given

627
00:33:13.010 --> 00:33:15.590
any challenges when they feel
like they're never, you know,

628
00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:18.140
they never have to work
for anything that they they're

629
00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:20.330
just sort of allowed to
do whatever they want. And,

630
00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:23.390
you know, there's this idea
that like most people would

631
00:33:23.390 --> 00:33:25.700
be happy if they just
got to have full autonomy

632
00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:28.280
over everything they did all
the time. I just, in

633
00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:31.520
my experience, that's actually not
true for everyone. There are

634
00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:34.430
a lot of people who
thrive under, you know, help

635
00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:37.280
me get directions and, and
help me focus and prioritize.

636
00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:39.560
And that's your job as
a manager to say no

637
00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:43.580
to occasionally ask them to
do unpleasant things and to,

638
00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:46.340
you know, just to generally
like help your team feel

639
00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:50.570
full responsibility for work and
not just, you know, not

640
00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:53.240
just kind of like a
drift and allowed to do

641
00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:56.440
whatever they want. Well, that
actually brings us to inappropriate

642
00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:58.630
callback. If we pop all
the way off the top

643
00:33:58.630 --> 00:34:00.580
of the stack to the
beginning of the conversation where

644
00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:02.620
we talk about how, you
know, as a manager or

645
00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:04.660
as a manager of managers,
you're providing a layer of

646
00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:08.440
abstraction, but here you're cautioning
us to not be too

647
00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:11.200
abstract because if you hide
too much, then you really

648
00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:12.910
just, you know, you put
a kind of a gross

649
00:34:12.910 --> 00:34:15.070
layer of abstraction on top
of something gross and technical

650
00:34:15.070 --> 00:34:18.910
debt will eventually catch up
with you. Yeah. And you

651
00:34:18.910 --> 00:34:22.000
know, frankly, the same thing
with, with organizational, a lot

652
00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.510
of people say, you know,
Oh, the manager should be

653
00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:31.510
a, put it nicely poop
umbrella. And you know, they

654
00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:36.250
should be shielding their teams
from, you know, bad things

655
00:34:36.250 --> 00:34:39.220
externally. And I think there's,
there's a little bit to

656
00:34:39.220 --> 00:34:43.750
this, right? Some organizations have
a lot of politics and

657
00:34:44.050 --> 00:34:47.830
kind of unhealthy behaviors, especially
at the senior levels. And

658
00:34:47.830 --> 00:34:49.450
you know, if you let
a lot of that leak

659
00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:52.630
through, into your team, that
can be very upsetting to

660
00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:54.910
them, or they really don't
need to know about, you

661
00:34:54.910 --> 00:34:58.720
know, executive X, stabbing executive,
why in the back that's,

662
00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:01.480
that's probably not healthy for
them. On the other hand,

663
00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:04.570
I think a lot of
people do that role and

664
00:35:04.570 --> 00:35:06.490
they say, Oh, well, like
I don't, you know, I

665
00:35:06.490 --> 00:35:09.550
don't need to, to, I
don't need to let them

666
00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:12.160
know that like, there's a
lot of uncertainty in this

667
00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:15.400
particular product plan and that,
you know, we're having, we're

668
00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:18.700
struggling in this part of
the business that happens to

669
00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:22.330
touch on my team's work.
I actually think it's bad

670
00:35:22.330 --> 00:35:24.640
to show to hide that
thing, that kind of thing

671
00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:26.980
from them. Right. Because then
they don't really have the

672
00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:30.860
context for what's going on.
Right. So there is, there,

673
00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:33.430
there are bad things that
happen that you do need

674
00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:35.560
to share with your team.
So they have the context

675
00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:38.760
to understand, Oh, we are
struggling to make this product

676
00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:42.060
successful. They may have great
ideas for that. If you

677
00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:46.020
pretend like the product is
really successful and you know,

678
00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:50.070
everything's going great when it
clearly isn't, then they can't

679
00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:53.040
be part of the solution.
Right? So, so you want

680
00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:55.800
to be careful with what
you hide from people, because

681
00:35:56.370 --> 00:35:58.110
part of what you want
to do is get them

682
00:35:58.110 --> 00:36:00.510
to, you know, give you
more, give you, give you

683
00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:03.330
ideas, or bring out the
best in them. And sometimes

684
00:36:03.330 --> 00:36:05.610
bringing out the best in
people requires them to understand

685
00:36:05.610 --> 00:36:07.980
the truth of the situation,
even when the situation is

686
00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:11.150
not great. Well, I really
appreciate you taking the time

687
00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:14.030
to chat with me today.
I'm very happy to have

688
00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:16.640
gotten a chance to do
it. Well. We've been chatting

689
00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:19.610
with Camille <inaudible>. She is
the head of platform engineering

690
00:36:19.610 --> 00:36:21.560
at two Sigma, and I
would really encourage everyone to

691
00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:24.080
check out her book, the
manager's path. If you enjoyed

692
00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:27.620
this podcast, it is a
big concentrated bunch of advice.

693
00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:30.710
It's effectively so much more
in a great book. And

694
00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:34.100
I am very much enjoying
reading it. This has been

695
00:36:34.130 --> 00:36:37.220
another episode of Hanselminutes and
we'll see you again next

696
00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:37.400
week.
