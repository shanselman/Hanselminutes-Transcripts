Hi, this is Scott Hanselman.

8
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.600
This is another episode of
Hansel minutes. And today I'm

9
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.390
talking with Suz Hinton. She's
a web and open source

10
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.300
hardware developer. How are you?
I'm good. Thank you. I'm

11
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.330
really excited to be here
talking with you. Yeah, I

12
00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.590
reached out to you because
I was perusing my medium,

13
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.340
the medium.com over at free
code camp. And I saw

14
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.440
a great new post that
you put up that says

15
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.670
lessons from my first year
of live coding on Twitch.

16
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.760
And that's a pretty Epic
title for a couple of

17
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:19.130
reasons first because it's lessons.
I like that it's live

18
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.190
coding. I also like that
it's on Twitch and not

19
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.030
YouTube or Google Hangouts. And
it's my first year. Like

20
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.010
you could have been like
lessons from my first week,

21
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.430
but you, you did something
that is hard and scary

22
00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.530
and you did it for
a year and I am

23
00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.300
totally blown away by that.
So I had to talk

24
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.440
to you. I really appreciate
that. I'm, I'm super pumped

25
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.920
to just like look back
on my year. And I

26
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.720
think that's why I wrote
it in the first place,

27
00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.120
because I think I've really
grown since. So I'm glad

28
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.690
that you sorta saw the
appeal. Did you intend to

29
00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.400
do something for a year
or is this, are you

30
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.890
going to live code on
Twitch for life or was

31
00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.930
this a start and in
beginning and an end kind

32
00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.650
of a thing I don't
know about for life, but

33
00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.070
I definitely just started with
just doing it once. I

34
00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.100
was like, I wonder how
this would go. And then

35
00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.370
I realized, Oh, this is
actually kind of like good

36
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.160
in different ways than I
thought it was going to

37
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.130
be. For example, is quite
motivating. And to, to be

38
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.010
able to do your work
when you're accountable to other

39
00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.340
people watching. So that's in
the end, why I stuck

40
00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.930
with it, but it definitely
started as an experiment. Did

41
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.840
you think that, how did
you come upon Twitch? Why

42
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.540
not just Google Hangouts or
like Twitch? I think of

43
00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.390
is Twitch is where people
go and play games. Yeah,

44
00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.210
definitely. I think that I
knew about Twitch back when

45
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.980
it was code justin.tv and
back then, it wasn't actually

46
00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.090
necessarily for like gaming platforms,
but now it's very much

47
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.980
heavily focused around that. And
I think that was kind

48
00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.560
of where they, they pivoted
a little bit when they

49
00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.830
became Twitch. And so I
just thought that that was

50
00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.650
kind of where you live
streamed your stuff. But I

51
00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.080
also noticed that there were
other programmers that who was

52
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.180
streaming on it. So I
thought, okay, well I'm not

53
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.220
the only one that will
be on there. So I

54
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.780
should probably give this a
go and try and find

55
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.270
a community here. Were there
any particular programmers or programs

56
00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.640
or games that like stuck
out at you when you

57
00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.100
were kind of perusing the
people who are live coding

58
00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.570
on Twitch? Yeah, for sure.
I think the first one

59
00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.700
that I saw was handmade
hero and a lot of

60
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.850
people will be familiar with
that programmer. I don't know

61
00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.460
whether you've, if you've watched
any of those episodes before

62
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.240
I did. Yeah. So like
he kind of starts from

63
00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:38.010
scratch and he makes a
game, including, I think the

64
00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.190
game engine from starting with
just C not using any

65
00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.630
frameworks or libraries and then
his goal was to complete

66
00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.530
an entire game and then
explain absolutely everything he was

67
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.110
doing on the along the
way, which seems like a

68
00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.080
really lofty goal to me.
And like super meticulous too,

69
00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.080
because you have to just
keep that going and keep

70
00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.420
talking as you're actually programming.
And I think that's what

71
00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.830
first fascinated me about it.
How the thing that blew

72
00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:09.330
me away about handmade hero
is the idea that something

73
00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.780
that's being begun without an
actual, like, thought about the

74
00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.510
end. Like he was like,
I'm going to start this.

75
00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.010
I'm going to do it
for a couple of years.

76
00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:19.890
We'll release everything to the
public domain. And you know,

77
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.170
if you want he'll, he'll
go and sell you the

78
00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:23.820
game and zip it all
up. And you know, for

79
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.940
15 bucks you can buy
it all. But to start

80
00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.130
a project like that without
knowing if you could even

81
00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.430
succeed or what if you
hit a, hit a bump

82
00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.660
for two weeks, that blows
me away. Yeah. I definitely

83
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.860
have always wanted that confidence
to start on something that

84
00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.100
big and probably be okay
with it if it fails

85
00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.320
to, because there's always that
chance. Right. So I'm sure

86
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.660
he had the confidence in
his skills to see it

87
00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.030
through. But I think when
you, when you have such

88
00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.370
a huge challenge like that,
it can possibly fail and

89
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.360
having the guts to start
on it anyway, definitely is

90
00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.990
quite inspiring to me. Yeah.
And he's doing it basically

91
00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.700
like an hour at a
time at hour at a

92
00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.690
time, and he's on several
hundred episodes now, 400 episodes,

93
00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.360
I think. Yeah. And he's
got like a ton of

94
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.820
followers as well. So it's,
it's really, really cool. Cause

95
00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.100
you can go back and
just watch them if you've

96
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.320
missed some or if you
kind of like didn't stop

97
00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.510
watching them when he started.
So I think that's really

98
00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:22.380
cool too. So did you
decide to put that level

99
00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:23.760
of effort in it? Were
you going to do like

100
00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.440
an hour a day or
an hour a week? What's

101
00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.800
your schedule like? Yeah, so
I do it a lot

102
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.780
less frequently and part of
that is like I just

103
00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.630
travel a lot for my
job. And also I thought,

104
00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:38.070
well, so I have this
friend who this is, this

105
00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.560
is totally related. I promise
I have this friend who

106
00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:47.460
needed to start flossing his
teeth. And instead of saying,

107
00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.160
all right, I'm going to
floss all my teeth every

108
00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.290
single day from now on
when I've never been in

109
00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:54.780
that habit instead, he's like,
all right, I'm going to

110
00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:58.010
floss one tooth, one tooth
every single day without fail.

111
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.050
And then he kind of
gradually built it up to

112
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.710
be every single tooth in
his mouth. And then that

113
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.330
became a habit for him.
And that to him was

114
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.570
basically saying let's like lower
that barrier to entry. And

115
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:12.080
so I had the same
attitude. I thought it's really,

116
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.410
really hard to find the
same time on the same

117
00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:17.930
schedule every single week. It's
much harder than people think

118
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:20.540
it is. Even if you've
got, you know, a weekend,

119
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.030
even if you've got free
week nights, that you're always

120
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:26.150
home. And so, you know,
that to me was an

121
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.300
achievable goal and I thought
maybe I'll stream for four

122
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:32.750
hours that Sunday, or maybe
I'll only stream for one

123
00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:35.330
hour that Sunday. But if
I start at the exact

124
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.350
same time, then I have
no excuses. I can't keep

125
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:41.150
putting it off till later
in the day and then

126
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:42.980
not do it. So to
me it was just something

127
00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:45.740
that would be achievable. And
in the end that's been

128
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.810
the most sustainable thing for
me. I don't think I've

129
00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:50.480
ever increased it to be
more, even though I've definitely

130
00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:54.310
considered it several times. You
said that you travel a

131
00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:58.300
lot. Do you like live,
switch, live, live Twitch, live

132
00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.390
stream from like the hotel?
So that would be really

133
00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:04.690
cool. I think that I
really like the, even though

134
00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:07.930
my, my setup isn't super,
super high quality. I do

135
00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.830
like having, you know, just
my, my desk at home.

136
00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:13.930
It's, it's kind of where
I feel the most productive.

137
00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:16.930
And also I have a
reliable internet connection. So I've

138
00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:20.530
thought about doing hotel streams,
but sometimes when you're traveling,

139
00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:23.200
it's just another layer on
top of like the stress

140
00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:26.170
that you have as well.
And so it kind of

141
00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.920
becomes my space to just
say, well, I might be

142
00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.110
a regular stream of, but
I also have like a

143
00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:34.090
personal life too. So I
think it definitely adds a

144
00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:36.010
human element if I have
to be missing for a

145
00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:39.820
weekend sometimes as well. Yeah.
Do people complain because we

146
00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:46.660
do the asp.net community stand
up on tuesdays@livedotasp.net and people

147
00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:49.000
get mad if we don't
show up, like if one

148
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.620
of us is out of
town, it's like, where are

149
00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:55.120
you guys? And you're like,
it's quite intense. So some

150
00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.250
of my regular view is
they'll, they'll definitely say this

151
00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:00.790
ad. I've definitely had someone
say, Oh, like I normally

152
00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:02.950
get out of bed like
early in the morning to

153
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:05.890
watch Susan's stream on Sunday,
but she's not streaming. So

154
00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:07.960
I'm just going to get
up in the afternoon instead.

155
00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:09.760
So like some of them
would just kind of try

156
00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.710
and make me feel guilty.
They'll be like, Oh, well

157
00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:13.180
I'm just not going to
get out of bed. Cause

158
00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:15.940
there's no point which is
very dramatic. But I think

159
00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:18.040
that that's really flattering and
it it's, it's their way

160
00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.200
of saying, Hey, we miss
you, which is really lovely.

161
00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:25.090
I like talking to people
who have, who are trying

162
00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:28.570
something that's maybe outside their
comfort zone. So like a

163
00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:32.170
lot, we hear about people
learning to give presentations. I've

164
00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:35.760
talked to people, who've been
programming five years and gone,

165
00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:37.840
decided to give a technical
talk and I've talked to

166
00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:40.150
people who've been 20 years
or more in the industry

167
00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:42.700
and they just gave their
first technical talk. So we

168
00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:45.280
hear a lot about this.
You see blog posts about

169
00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:49.120
encouraging people to give, to
give their first tech talk,

170
00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.430
but you don't really hear
about that. Like we should

171
00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:55.500
all be live coding on
Twitch or on that. Like,

172
00:08:56.130 --> 00:09:00.030
I don't know, public speaking
times a thousand, like I

173
00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:03.300
am, I am a somewhat
professional public speaker and I

174
00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:05.930
am intimidated by the idea
that you would go and

175
00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:08.670
be able to do that.
Do you see that those

176
00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:11.190
things are related, but one
is more intense than the

177
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:14.570
other? Yeah, I think that's
a really great observation. So

178
00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:17.060
I do a fair amount
of public speaking as well

179
00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:20.690
because, because I tend to
work in, we had spaces

180
00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:22.850
in open source, like node
JS hardware. I tend to

181
00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:25.670
get invited to do a
lot of talks. And so

182
00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:28.730
I'd been public speaking for
a number of years, but

183
00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:33.170
when I approached starting with
Twitch, I thought it was

184
00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:34.850
going to be really similar.
I'm like, Oh, I'm just

185
00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:37.310
giving a talk or it's
just like a webinar, but

186
00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:41.060
it is a completely different
experience. And when I first

187
00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:44.900
started, I felt an anxiety
like that. I hadn't felt

188
00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:47.060
for a very long time,
not since I first kind

189
00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:52.130
of started public speaking for
Shaw. It feels like, it

190
00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:54.200
feels like you have a
bunch of people in your

191
00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:59.420
room, but it feels a
lot more intimate than giving

192
00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:01.790
a public talk on a
stage. If that makes sense.

193
00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:06.170
Cause you're inviting people into
your weekend and your, they

194
00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:09.500
can see like the livestream
video view at your desk.

195
00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:12.110
So it definitely feels much
more intimate than a public

196
00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:17.120
speaker Engagement. When I give
talks, I always, you know,

197
00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:20.210
I've, I've blogged about this.
I struggle with imposter syndrome

198
00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:23.420
and feeling like a phony,
I would only assume that

199
00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:28.100
that is magnified when you
are trying to produce, like

200
00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:32.570
I can produce what I
call edutainment, you know, I

201
00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:35.240
can educate and entertain on
stage, but if I actually

202
00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:37.970
have to write something from
scratch and make it work

203
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.010
and that, that feels very,
very intimate. And were you

204
00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:45.740
afraid that people were going
to, like, I dunno like

205
00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:48.080
an mean anonymous people were
gonna be like you suck

206
00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:51.350
and here's proof I've got
it on video 100%. Yes.

207
00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:54.560
I was really, really worried
for a number of different

208
00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:59.060
reasons. So like I've been
programming professionally for, I think

209
00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.820
11 or 12 years now.
And so like, I know

210
00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:04.070
how to work with teams
and you know, I know

211
00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:06.680
how to write good code
or I want to think

212
00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:08.210
that I do, but you
know, there's always room for

213
00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:13.100
improvement. And so the difference
is that usually when I'm

214
00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:15.230
working with teams or if
I'm pushing up stuff to

215
00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:19.910
open source, I'm testing stuff
out completely with like the

216
00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:22.820
lecturey that it feels like
to me now, the luxury

217
00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:26.570
of privacy where no one's
watching over my shoulder and

218
00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:28.940
I'm just able to play
with code and I'm able

219
00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:31.190
to write bad code and
then improve it and then

220
00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:33.980
refactor it right. Even, you
know, push it up and

221
00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:36.110
then force push over the
top of it. If you

222
00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:39.980
found something embarrassing. And I
don't really have that when

223
00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:44.030
I'm live coding on Twitch.
I honestly feel that this

224
00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:48.470
definitely this safety net, that's
not there that I feel

225
00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:50.600
when I'm able to kind
of just do that by

226
00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:54.760
myself. And so probably what
scared me the most. I

227
00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:58.600
thought that if I started
coding that this kind of

228
00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:03.310
carefully crafted reputation, you know,
for me professionally where people

229
00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:05.800
really enjoy working with me,
they think that, you know,

230
00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.170
that I'm a good programmer.
I thought that people were

231
00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:11.920
going to find out this
disgraceful secret that I actually

232
00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:15.760
am not very good because
they judge me kind of

233
00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.980
on the quick code that
I'm writing on the live

234
00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:19.780
stream. Right. And they're like,
Oh, well this is her

235
00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:23.140
in her, in her in
a comfortable situation, but that's

236
00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:24.940
really not the case at
all. You know? So you

237
00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:28.330
kind of have to embrace
that. You're going to be

238
00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:33.010
scared and embrace that maybe
people will be mean, but

239
00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:37.140
most people in my experience
with being super simple, I

240
00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:40.050
could see if, if I'm
going to put a little

241
00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:41.490
bit of a fine point
on this and tell me

242
00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:44.070
if I'm going in the
wrong direction. But if I,

243
00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:48.360
as a middle aged man
or to say, well, you

244
00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:51.000
just have to embrace that,
that people are going to

245
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.880
be mean sometimes. And I
told that to maybe someone

246
00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:55.680
who is younger than you
and I, and maybe just

247
00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:58.080
getting started you of course
are not just getting started,

248
00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:59.970
but someone's getting started. I
said, you should go out

249
00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:03.150
there. Someone being mean could
knock them right off of

250
00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:06.450
their, right off their perch
and make them it could

251
00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:08.610
ruin them. You know what
I mean? We hear about

252
00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:11.610
people getting very cruel treatment
because of a GitHub pull

253
00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:15.030
request. I can only imagine
that coding for an hour

254
00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:17.400
and doing a lousy job
of it would definitely fuel

255
00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:21.510
the trolls. You don't don't
you think that as a

256
00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:24.480
woman in tech you're, you're
going to come up against

257
00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.400
those kinds of mean people.
And do you just push

258
00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.920
through it or are you
not cultivating any kind of

259
00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:31.650
mean people like that? Yeah,
I think that that's actually

260
00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:33.930
a really great point to
make and it's part of

261
00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:36.420
why I felt fear. Like
that's another reason why I

262
00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:40.200
felt fear was that for
me, as a woman in

263
00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:44.130
tech, I feel extra pressure
to be perfect at everything,

264
00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:48.330
you know, perfect at code
perfect at emotional labor. I

265
00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:51.420
also need to look the
pot and just be very,

266
00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:55.140
very nice and, you know,
not be blunt or anything

267
00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:58.620
like that. And so I
felt like everything was on

268
00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:02.850
display when I first started
programming on Twitch and I

269
00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:05.640
thought someone's going to come
in and either to make

270
00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:08.790
themselves feel better about themselves
or just because they're just

271
00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:13.830
really, really unkind in general.
I honestly was just waiting

272
00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:18.870
every stream for just this
flurry of really awful abusive

273
00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:23.040
viewers to come in and
start trolling me. I honestly

274
00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:26.010
expected it. And I know
that's really, really cynical, but

275
00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:28.680
just being a woman in
tech and moving around that

276
00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:31.200
space, you know, in the
industry for as long as

277
00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:34.050
I have, you definitely see
stuff and it is death

278
00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:37.290
by a thousand paper cuts.
So I was preparing myself

279
00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:40.500
for that, which is kind
of sad to think. I

280
00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:44.100
don't know why, and I'm
still a little bit suspicious,

281
00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:48.120
but it actually has been
very, very positive. And some

282
00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:50.310
of the trolls I've gotten
have actually made me laugh

283
00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:54.490
more than anything was the
biggest surprise. That's good. Well,

284
00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:56.590
it seems also though that
after you've been doing this

285
00:14:56.590 --> 00:14:59.620
for a while, for over
a year that you have

286
00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:01.960
a community now and even
you've even gone so far

287
00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.870
as to call them a
family, I would assume that

288
00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:06.730
they would back you up
as any good family would

289
00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:09.820
if there were trouble. That's
right. And I have seen

290
00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:13.360
examples of that. So for
example, I have a, I

291
00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:15.970
have a chat room that
says, cause you can actually

292
00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:18.460
set up chat roles in
your channel below that says

293
00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:21.250
things like, Hey, you know,
if you like my shirt,

294
00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:23.560
it's cool to say like
cool shirt, but maybe just

295
00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:27.880
don't really comment on my
appearance. Especially like, especially in

296
00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:30.580
a way that's talking about
me being attractive or something

297
00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:33.400
like that. And some people
will come in, not read

298
00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:37.240
the roles and they'll be
very cliche. They'll even say

299
00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:39.790
things like, Oh, I just
can't believe that there's like

300
00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:42.820
a lady coding. And like,
that's so awesome. And then

301
00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:45.520
they'll talk about my parents
and a lot of my

302
00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:48.820
family as, as, as I
call them, like, if you

303
00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:51.850
read my, my article, they'll
come in and say, Hey,

304
00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:54.310
like just cool. It like,
you know, women in tech

305
00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:57.280
are a thing and I'm
sorry if you haven't seen

306
00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:01.180
that before, but you know,
Susan is just another developer

307
00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:04.030
like us. And so they're
really good about doing that.

308
00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:07.930
And I've had some really
funny trolls actually where they

309
00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:10.720
don't even care about that.
They'll just come in, they'll

310
00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:13.330
see that I'm maintaining like
a JavaScript library that I

311
00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:16.660
wrote a little while ago
before IES 2015 came out

312
00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:20.380
and they'll just be like,
Oh, you're coding an ESBL

313
00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:23.560
five. Like, why are you
doing that? And like, Oh,

314
00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:26.620
like you can't write Java
script. You're bad at it.

315
00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:29.680
And it's so bizarre to
see that that I'm like,

316
00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:32.290
yeah, if that's going to
bother you on the stream,

317
00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:34.060
then I'm not sure this
is the stream for you.

318
00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:36.040
Cause it was still having
a lot of fun even

319
00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:38.680
if we're not using the
latest features. So I actually

320
00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:42.280
get more of that then
trolls about my gender or

321
00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:46.240
anything. And again, that's blown
me away how supportive my

322
00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:49.330
family have been, even if
that has actually happened once

323
00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:52.660
or twice during my stream.
You had mentioned that one

324
00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:54.730
of the things that was
the most fun that continues,

325
00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:56.770
you do a lot of
work in the, you said

326
00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:59.050
in the open source hardware
and kind of the no

327
00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:04.210
JS hardware libraries. So talking
to Arduinos and things. Did

328
00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:05.920
you have a situation once
where you may have had

329
00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:08.110
a bit of a glitch
and a Arduino board while

330
00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:11.650
you were on a live
stream? Yeah. So I think,

331
00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:14.760
I think you interviewed Daniel
Shiffman a little while back

332
00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:17.350
and you was saying that
sometimes a lot of his,

333
00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:20.680
his videos, he has to
edit out whole sections of

334
00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:23.980
debugging. And so, you know,
I obviously don't have that

335
00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:26.980
luxury. And so people are
kind of sitting with me

336
00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:29.980
and sometimes they'll point out
like typos in my code,

337
00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:32.620
which is extremely helpful because
it's really, really hard to

338
00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:34.870
spot them when you're talking
aloud at the same time.

339
00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:38.080
But then other times I'll
be holding the Arduino board

340
00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:40.300
up to the camera so
that, you know, everyone can

341
00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:43.150
watch the lights blinking as
it uploads the program, for

342
00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:45.490
example. And so I try
and make it so that

343
00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:48.040
everyone can see what I'm
doing at all times. They

344
00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:50.940
don't have to guess. And
that saved me one day

345
00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:52.890
because I was holding up
the board and I was

346
00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:56.160
like, Hey everyone, I just
don't know why my software

347
00:17:56.160 --> 00:18:00.360
is broken. It's just saying
that the Arduino board is,

348
00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:03.780
is not plugged in. Right.
And then someone pointed out

349
00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:09.150
and said, Oh, your microchip
is actually not stuck on

350
00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:11.700
the board. Like you've popped
it out of the socket.

351
00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:14.280
It doesn't have a chip,
so it can't talk to

352
00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:17.430
it. So it thinks that
there's nothing plugged in. And

353
00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:19.680
like there is a video
in my article where I

354
00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:24.090
just erupt into the most
ridiculous peels of laughter because

355
00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:26.670
it's just, you know, we
were stuck on that for

356
00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:29.430
several minutes and that was
such a simple thing that

357
00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:32.160
I should look for. But
you know, my view as

358
00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:35.540
a like so super smart
and they spotted it immediately,

359
00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:39.470
Which is great. That's awesome.
So when did the techs,

360
00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:42.020
the tech support, did you
try plugging it in like

361
00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:46.250
of course I Oh no.
Yeah. When they said that

362
00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:48.830
in chat, I was like,
no. And I was like,

363
00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:55.640
Oh, you're right. That's Epic.
I'm looking at your, at

364
00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:59.450
your get hub, which is
quite extensive. It's got a

365
00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:01.790
lot of great information for
people who are learning about

366
00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:04.460
Arduino and learning about node
JS. And you have a

367
00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:08.030
thing called AVR girl dash
Arduino. What is that project?

368
00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:11.030
Yeah. So that's actually a
project that I work on

369
00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:13.640
very heavily on my Twitch
stream. It is one of

370
00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:17.000
the most popular libraries that
have put out there. So

371
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.720
AVR girl, the name itself
is like agenda bend on

372
00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:24.500
the software product. That's already
out there code AVR dude.

373
00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:32.570
So yeah. So AVR dude,
it's, it's a backronym so

374
00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:35.870
it stands for AVR upload
download, but it kind of

375
00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:38.900
uses like letters in the
middle of the words and

376
00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:42.410
all that kind of thing.
Are you for uploader dude

377
00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:46.250
or? Okay. I got it.
That makes sense. Yeah. So

378
00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:49.700
that's actually what the Arduino
IDE the actual code editor

379
00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:53.270
is using under the surface
to upload the compiled code

380
00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:57.560
that you've written to the
Arduino. And so I wanted

381
00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:00.470
to write a no JS
version of that so that

382
00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:05.780
we have like a really
popular robotics scene in like

383
00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:09.530
the no JS ecosystem code
node bytes. And we teach

384
00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:12.980
people how to use JavaScript
to control electronics and robotics.

385
00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:16.460
And part of that involves
running workshops. We have like

386
00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:19.430
an international, no butts day
every year, which has really,

387
00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:22.850
really awesome. And we found
that people had to download

388
00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:26.990
the people, have to download
the Arduino IDE, but after

389
00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:29.780
they kind of uploaded this
one script that we gave

390
00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:32.030
them, they pretty much wrote
JavaScript for the rest of

391
00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:34.400
the day. And so it
was a really odd experience

392
00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.650
and I wanted to write
a whole bunch of JavaScript

393
00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:40.130
tool chains so that people
running the workshop could also

394
00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:42.620
write their setup scripts and
JavaScript too. And so it

395
00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:44.750
kind of all kept it
all in the same ecosystem

396
00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:47.710
and it allowed people to
kind of write extensions very

397
00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:52.180
easily. So that was a
long, long winded way of

398
00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:55.390
kind of explaining what AVL
girl had. We know. Does

399
00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:58.570
it allows you to flash
compiled C plus plus code

400
00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:03.060
onto devices using no JS.
Oh, okay. So let me

401
00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:05.610
see if I can provide
historical context and paraphrase that

402
00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:10.260
correctly then. So AVR dude,
the AVR is the Atmel

403
00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:13.650
microcontrollers, right? The Atmel AVR.
That's the, that's the chip

404
00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:17.070
that's powers. The Ardwino. Yeah.
Correct. I did miss that

405
00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:20.070
bit out. So thank you.
Yes. And then AVR dude

406
00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:23.670
is like 15 years old,
thanks to a 14 year

407
00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:27.090
old software that really hasn't
even been thought about in

408
00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:29.550
the last seven years or
so. And it was very

409
00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:32.490
low level. And since node
is so much higher level,

410
00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:36.360
now AVR girl gives you
that kind of modern 2017

411
00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:39.540
way of flashing this microcontroller,
which just makes life better

412
00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:43.680
for everybody. That's totally the
idea. And what in a

413
00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:46.950
mysterious turn of events are
we Arduino actually consume and

414
00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:50.430
use that library. Now they
have a code editor in

415
00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:55.620
the browser and on Chrome
OS, they ended up creating

416
00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:58.890
like an app that uses
AVL girl Arduino in a

417
00:21:58.890 --> 00:22:02.640
browser environment. So you can
write code, but then flash

418
00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:06.060
that code to the device
straight from the chromo S

419
00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:08.790
which is kind of awesome.
And so that was really

420
00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:10.800
exciting when they reached out
to say, Hey, thanks for

421
00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:13.650
writing this. We ended up
like consuming and using it.

422
00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:16.560
So I thought that that
was really Exciting. That's cool.

423
00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:18.780
And it looks like it's
an MIT license, so it's

424
00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:23.100
very friendly to things like
that. I try. Nice. Yeah.

425
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.460
So let me understand that
I have opened up the

426
00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:28.830
Arduino IDE, and I know
how to use that when

427
00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:31.620
I'm writing no JS code,
does this mean I don't

428
00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:33.810
need the Arduino IDE at
all? I just use AVR

429
00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:38.760
girl instead. It depends. So
there are definitely, there's definitely

430
00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:40.500
steps that you need to
do before you use it.

431
00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:43.320
VR gorilla wino, where you
can pretty much like write

432
00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:47.550
Adrina code in any editor
and you can use the

433
00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:50.340
OD Wiener ID to just
kind of compile that code

434
00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:53.130
and then upload it. But
there are other tools out

435
00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:56.100
there that you can use
to compile the Arduino code

436
00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:59.850
first. So there is that
extra step beforehand that you

437
00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:03.090
need to do before you
can actually take that finished

438
00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:06.690
file and upload it using
AVL girl, I do have

439
00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:12.060
an experimental library code, AVL
pizza, which is a long

440
00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:16.890
story, and it actually doesn't
require any like compilation told

441
00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:20.340
teens to exist on your
computer. What you can do

442
00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:24.150
is you can just send
it. It's just a no

443
00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:26.610
JS wrapper. So you give
the path to the file

444
00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:28.770
that you want to compile.
And it will kind of

445
00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:33.300
toggle that out, send it
up to a cloud hosted

446
00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:36.120
and machine and it will
compile it and send it

447
00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:38.850
back down to you via
an API request. So I

448
00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:42.690
code it AVL pizza, because
it delivers you, you ask

449
00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:45.530
for a, you supply a
toggle and you get pizza,

450
00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:48.670
which is your compiled code.
That was the idea. That's

451
00:23:48.670 --> 00:23:52.000
cool. But that means that
I could potentially teach our

452
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.620
doing out to a whole
room full of people, no

453
00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:56.260
matter what kind of machines
that they had. And even

454
00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:58.630
if they had Chromebooks, like
you said, right. And then

455
00:23:58.630 --> 00:24:01.570
it would be available to
everyone. That's exactly right. I

456
00:24:01.570 --> 00:24:04.000
think a lot of the
time that we lose running

457
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.800
these workshops is just the
really nuanced differences between everyone's

458
00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:11.380
computers, even if they're even
running a very similar operating

459
00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:14.620
system. And so this poor
person would just get lost.

460
00:24:14.650 --> 00:24:17.230
There would be blaming themselves
when they finally asked for

461
00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:19.720
help, they were like 10
steps behind. And then we

462
00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:21.820
would feel that that was
a bad experience for them

463
00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:24.130
and that we could do
better than that. And so

464
00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:26.620
a lot of these tools
have come about and some

465
00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:29.560
of them is still experimental,
like ABL pizza, where I

466
00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:32.860
just want it. I just
want robotics to be the

467
00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:36.250
nicest, most fun experience out
of the gate. So that,

468
00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:40.720
that intimidation factor that people
kind of feel about hardware

469
00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:43.750
just completely flies out the
window within like 10 seconds

470
00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:47.830
of the workshop. Okay. Yeah.
That's, that's the kind of

471
00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:51.040
stuff. What I work on.net
where I want like telling

472
00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:53.080
people like, Hey, everyone, let's
start our workshop, but first

473
00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:55.660
we have to download a
two gig like IDE and

474
00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:57.700
ISO file. And you don't
want your workshop to be

475
00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:00.640
all about Set up. Right.
And even if you set

476
00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:03.790
them that as homework, you
know, that like 50% or

477
00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:06.070
more of them and not
going to get that email

478
00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:07.690
or they're going to forget,
and then they're going to

479
00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:10.180
turn up and you've got
really bad wifi at the

480
00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:13.090
venue. And then everyone's trying
to suck down two gigs

481
00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:16.120
and passing around a thumb
drive with the software on

482
00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:19.540
it. So yeah, I totally
get it. So speaking of

483
00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:22.720
hardware and set up, if
someone who is listening is

484
00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:25.900
finally after listening to us
for 25 minutes, decided that

485
00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:28.960
they are going to start
streaming online. What do they

486
00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:31.870
need? They need to buy
something or could they stream

487
00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:35.620
to Twitch like right away.
That's a really good question.

488
00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:39.190
So all of the tools
that I use and including

489
00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:43.660
Twitch, the service itself, I've
never actually paid for. So

490
00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:45.820
it is really, really quick
to get up and running

491
00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:51.700
and it's free as well.
And so Twitch, the platform,

492
00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:53.800
you sign up for a
free account and you get

493
00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:57.100
what's called a streaming key.
And that streaming key allows

494
00:25:57.100 --> 00:26:01.000
you to once you've been
some streaming software. So for

495
00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.350
example, I use OBS, which
is open broadcaster software and

496
00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:08.830
that's free and open source
obviously from there, the name

497
00:26:08.830 --> 00:26:12.640
open. And so if you
just drop your Twitch stream

498
00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:16.240
key in there, and you
set up a scene with

499
00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:19.900
your webcam and maybe like
a desktop capture, like that

500
00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:22.060
is actually the bare bones
set up to get you

501
00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:25.450
going to start streaming out
of the box. Do you

502
00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:28.660
need a fast machine? Like,
because you are basically what

503
00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:31.180
encoding the screen and sending
it out the wire at

504
00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:35.050
X frames a second. Yeah,
totally. So I know that

505
00:26:35.050 --> 00:26:38.020
some people's laptops that, that
are, you know, four or

506
00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:40.870
five years old can struggle
a little bit. I did

507
00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:44.580
start streaming initially on a
two and 12 MacBook pro

508
00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:48.210
and that was a year
ago. And so I did

509
00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:51.150
have to put a slight
delay on my microphone because

510
00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:53.550
it couldn't keep up with
composite doing all of the

511
00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:57.120
video. So I eventually upgraded
to a better laptop, but

512
00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:59.640
that actually served me really
well for, I think at

513
00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:02.220
least six months, it was
only when I added a

514
00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:04.500
second webcam and I was
using that to kind of

515
00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:06.420
show the hardware project that
I was working on on

516
00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:09.810
my desk. That's when we
just had a lot of

517
00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:13.530
dropped frames and things like
that. So I would say

518
00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:15.600
that if you've, if you've
got something like a Mac

519
00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:19.560
book pro or, you know,
a PC that's only like,

520
00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:23.220
you know, three years old,
then it's, you're probably good

521
00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:26.040
to go with that. And
you can do nice tricks,

522
00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:29.730
like altering the bit rate,
maybe just lowering the quality

523
00:27:29.730 --> 00:27:33.540
slightly on the video. And
you'll find that your machine

524
00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:36.800
can catch up a little
bit more. Okay. So giving,

525
00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:39.500
like you don't just assume
that everyone's running 10 ADP

526
00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:42.980
and small fonts, I assume
that small fonts get kind

527
00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:45.560
of JPEG or artifact and
you'd have to think a

528
00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:49.670
little bit about your presentation.
Yeah, definitely. So just, just

529
00:27:49.670 --> 00:27:53.420
when I give presentations, you
know, normal presentations on stage,

530
00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:56.390
I guess I usually blow
up my phone really large.

531
00:27:56.390 --> 00:27:59.180
And so a lot of
those rules still apply. Like,

532
00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:02.330
imagine you're presenting this to
people that might be watching

533
00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:04.430
on their iPad or they
could be watching on a

534
00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:08.090
small computer, or you could
just be going through a

535
00:28:08.090 --> 00:28:11.870
bit of a J Peggy
artifacty kind of looking stream

536
00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:15.080
if your Internet's not great.
So yeah, definitely compensate for

537
00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:19.160
that, but I've had pretty
good mileage. It's usually the

538
00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:22.760
audio delays that sometimes happen
to me A couple of

539
00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:26.210
times I've tried live streaming
and I've accidentally like pasted

540
00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:28.700
my password in. Or if
someone is like seen a

541
00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:31.850
connection string, how do you
prevent that kind of stuff?

542
00:28:32.030 --> 00:28:34.550
Yeah. So a lot of
people are really scared to

543
00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:37.040
start streaming. And I've like
in the last few days

544
00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:39.080
since writing the article, people
have been like, I'm just

545
00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:42.260
so scared. I'm going to
accidentally open a doc file

546
00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:46.160
or something. And that's definitely
something that I I'm very,

547
00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:50.420
very careful with. I have
a special scene that I

548
00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:53.090
set up and it scenes
in OBS like a thing

549
00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:57.170
where you can switch between
different layouts. So I have

550
00:28:57.170 --> 00:28:59.480
a whole layout where it
just shows my webcam in

551
00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:02.840
the corner, but I have
this funny GIF and I

552
00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:05.120
forget the artist's name, but
it's really cool. And she's,

553
00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:08.000
there's a, does just a
cartoon picture of a woman

554
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.430
walking down the stairs. And
it just says in the

555
00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:13.280
corner doing secret stuff, give
me a sec. And so

556
00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:16.610
if I, if let's say
I'm working with an API

557
00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:18.920
and my token expires, or
I need to read some

558
00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:21.710
debug output, some people have
a second monitor that they

559
00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:24.770
can kind of drag the
window over to, but I

560
00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:27.110
work with just one monitor
so I can stay focused

561
00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:29.510
on everything. And I end
up switching to that scene

562
00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:31.220
and people think it's really
funny. And they try to

563
00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:34.160
guess what I'm doing. Sometimes
they're like, Oh, she's doing

564
00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:36.620
secret stuff. What she's doing.
So it can actually add

565
00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:39.980
a little bit of like
entertainment. Whereas normally that sounds

566
00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:42.040
really boring. It's like, Oh
wait, hang on. I have

567
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:44.560
to like do the silly
token thing. So yeah, there's

568
00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:47.970
definitely tactics, But you do
think about it, like, like

569
00:29:47.970 --> 00:29:50.190
you're a director of your
own TV show, so you've

570
00:29:50.190 --> 00:29:54.210
got your like technical difficulties
screen that pops up and

571
00:29:54.570 --> 00:29:57.210
you switch your scenes. So
you're managing the camera angles

572
00:29:57.210 --> 00:30:00.420
and all that kind of
stuff with these OBS scenes.

573
00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:03.990
Yeah. It's so true. Like
sometimes I'm super cookie and

574
00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:06.840
I'll switch to a completely
different computer just by switching

575
00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:09.300
scenes. So I'll be like,
Oh, I'm now VNC it

576
00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:11.610
into my windows box so
we can test out this

577
00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:14.310
bug. That's only happening on
windows or, Oh, this is

578
00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:16.740
my Linux laptop, because like
someone said that there was

579
00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:19.030
some funny behavior going on
in Linux. So it's, it's

580
00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:23.850
pretty funny. My last question
is that when you started

581
00:30:23.850 --> 00:30:27.510
this, you were actually rehearsing,
like you would prepare for

582
00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:30.650
your stream. Like it was
a talk, but you didn't

583
00:30:30.650 --> 00:30:32.550
even, you didn't even rehearse
anymore. Right. I mean, do

584
00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:37.110
you just show up and
start typing? Yeah, that's true.

585
00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:40.320
So I would say that
the rehearsing came from me

586
00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:44.120
seeing, like I was coming
from doing like a, a

587
00:30:44.290 --> 00:30:47.430
public speaking presentation. Right. And
so I thought, Oh, well,

588
00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:49.800
like to give a good
presentation, you have to rehearse

589
00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:52.590
lots of times and I've
never done live coding on

590
00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:54.990
stage, but I imagined that
I would end up rehearsing

591
00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:57.570
that over and over again
to get it right. And

592
00:30:57.570 --> 00:30:59.310
so I just thought, Oh,
that's what you do on

593
00:30:59.310 --> 00:31:03.270
Twitch. And also I was
so afraid of tarnishing my

594
00:31:03.270 --> 00:31:07.890
reputation by making a single
mistake, but I also thought

595
00:31:07.890 --> 00:31:10.860
that, Oh, if I make
a mistake and start debugging,

596
00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:13.230
maybe people will get lost
and not know what I'm

597
00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:16.110
doing, or maybe it will
just ruin the kind of

598
00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:18.810
tutorial where people will just
kind of lose interest. So

599
00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:22.110
I was so afraid of
my own reputation and just

600
00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:25.500
like showing those words that
I just rehearsed so many

601
00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:28.200
times, and I had a
secret branch where I'd committed

602
00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:31.020
it, you know, in case
I needed to quickly look

603
00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:34.140
at it in the morning.
And it definitely was a

604
00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:38.310
symptom of my own self
esteem as a coder that

605
00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:42.540
I felt I hadn't really
noticed that much. And so

606
00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:44.130
it was a really good
thing to kind of allow

607
00:31:44.130 --> 00:31:46.470
me to get over that
fear for sure. And I

608
00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:49.290
think that it makes you
way, way more relatable, where

609
00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:52.650
people like, Oh, people who
even have been doing front

610
00:31:52.650 --> 00:31:55.050
end coding for a long
time, still mess up, or

611
00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:58.290
sometimes, you know, like they,
they do typos and it's

612
00:31:58.290 --> 00:32:01.620
important to show that I
think, Yeah. It's like those,

613
00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:06.090
those pulpy newspapers that you
see where it's like stars,

614
00:32:06.090 --> 00:32:09.240
they're just like us. I
think everyone, everyone feels like

615
00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:11.910
they don't know what they're
doing. And the fact is

616
00:32:11.910 --> 00:32:14.070
we're all learning. We're all
on stack overflow. I mean,

617
00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:16.260
Deloitte, do you Google and
go to stack overflow during

618
00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:21.390
your stream? Totally. Yes. And
sometimes I'll even say, can

619
00:32:21.390 --> 00:32:24.210
someone look this up for
me? Like, I'll look up

620
00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:28.320
the method. Yeah. And it's
really cool. Or maybe I'll

621
00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:31.620
just look something up real
quick and like, I'll feel

622
00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:33.780
bad for, you know, like
wasting time or what I

623
00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:36.270
think is wasting time. So
run back, I'll start using

624
00:32:36.270 --> 00:32:38.580
a method and someone will
say, actually, no, I think

625
00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:42.110
that this array method is
better. And I just looked

626
00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:44.960
up what version of node
it's compatible with and you're

627
00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:47.840
totally core to use it.
And so that's huge for

628
00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:50.720
me. And so I like
to describe my Twitch stream

629
00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:54.680
as like massively multiplayer online
pair programming, or like, you

630
00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:59.210
know, mob programming on the
internet because that's me shows

631
00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:02.750
that people feel comfortable to
engage with me. They feel

632
00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:06.530
confident enough that even if
they don't know much about

633
00:33:06.530 --> 00:33:09.050
the library, I'm working on
that they feel that they're

634
00:33:09.050 --> 00:33:11.450
welcome to still help out.
And I think that that

635
00:33:11.450 --> 00:33:14.210
has been the magic that
I've seen in my community.

636
00:33:14.650 --> 00:33:17.050
That's awesome. Well, thanks so
much for talking with me

637
00:33:17.050 --> 00:33:19.840
today. Yeah, this was super
great. Yeah. I'm going to
