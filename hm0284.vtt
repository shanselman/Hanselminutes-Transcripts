00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.840
developer on technologist and Scott
Hanselman. This is Lawrence Ryan announcing

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.930
In this episode, Talks with
Nick ganja about building his

7
00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.900
business. Zoc doc. Hi, this
is Scott Hanselman and this

8
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.320
is another episode of Hansel
minutes. The startup series continues

9
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.480
today. We've got Nick Ganju
founder and CTO of Zoc

10
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.390
doc. How are you, sir?
Great. How's it going over

11
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.430
there? Very, very well. I
hear a little crowd noise

12
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.180
behind you. What a what
event? I'm actually a recruiting

13
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.720
here at the Stanford alumni
career fair here in Palo

14
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.390
Alto. Alright, cool. So you're
are you guys based in

15
00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.450
the Bay area? No, we're
actually based in, in New York

16
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.130
city, but we, you know,
we're, we're very obsessive about

17
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.380
our hiring and, and so
we flew all the way

18
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.840
out here to do this
recruiting event. Very cool. Very

19
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.630
cool. So what's the elevator
pitch? What is your company?

20
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.340
Yeah, so it's basically a
website where you can come

21
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.760
and search for doctors. You
can read reviews, you can

22
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.050
search by your insurance and
more importantly, your insurance plan.

23
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.770
And, and then you can
book the doctors right online,

24
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.800
you know, similarly to the
way you would book an,

25
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.090
a, a reservation on open
table. Okay. So how do

26
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.950
people like do this now?
Like I think I usually

27
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.030
just search for pediatrician, Portland,
Oregon. And then I look

28
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.430
around for, I kind of
stumbled around looking for reviews

29
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.590
and I asked friends if
they think the guy's a

30
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.220
good guy or not. Yeah.
It's interesting. You know, as

31
00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.520
our, as our SEO gets
better and better as you

32
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.890
Google those kinds of things,
you'll see our pages showing

33
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.390
up, but basically it would
still be hard if you

34
00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.610
did it that way to
filter by your insurance plan.

35
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
And, you know, at SOC
doc, all the, all the

36
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.580
different doctors are aggregated one
place in the same format.

37
00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.800
So there's all the reviews
you can see where they

38
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.710
all went to medical school,
you know, any papers they've

39
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.370
published and of course some
high quality photos of, of

40
00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.860
them in their office. So
it, you know, I think

41
00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.190
it's, it's just a much
better destination site to, to

42
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.170
make a decision about which
doctor you want to see

43
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.390
And do the doctors come
to you and fill out

44
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.490
these things? Is it like
LinkedIn for doctors? Are they

45
00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.460
there? Or like, you know
how restaurants go into Google

46
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.040
places and they, they, they
put themselves in there and

47
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.250
they claim their space. And
how much of it's curated?

48
00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.630
How much of it is
the doctor coming to you?

49
00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.700
Yeah, the doctors. So the
business model is that the

50
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.010
doctors pay us to be
on the network. So they

51
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.190
pay us a flat fee,
a flat monthly fee, and,

52
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.100
and then we send them
new patients. So that's the,

53
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.800
you know, that's the basic
value proposition to the doctors.

54
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.240
So they basically come and
sign up with us and,

55
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.900
and they fill out their
own profiles and, and put

56
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.070
their own schedules, make their
own schedules available. So then

57
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.290
you make money from the
doctor. And then also during

58
00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.860
the referral process. Yeah. I
mean the doctors pay us

59
00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.430
a flat fee. It's not
per referral, but yeah. So,

60
00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.920
so they just pay us
a flat monthly fee and,

61
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.010
and it's completely free for
patients like yourself to, you

62
00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.230
know, if you were searching
for pediatricians and, and the

63
00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.060
most important thing is you
can either, he can see

64
00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.590
all the times and you
can book online. So, you

65
00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.450
know, if they're free tomorrow
or you can find one

66
00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.330
that's free, you know, during
evening hours, et cetera. I

67
00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.100
see. So that's where it
gets interesting. So it's one

68
00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.980
thing to be a dating
service for, for doctors where

69
00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.650
you like, I'm you hook
me up with a doctor

70
00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.110
and then our relationship is
over, but you said a

71
00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.930
flat monthly fee, what's more
interesting is that you are

72
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.680
effectively their front end. You're
their appointment scheduler. And the

73
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.230
doctor, I assume, has some
package running in their office.

74
00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.350
And then they synchronize with
your, with your assistant to

75
00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.750
make sure that the times
are available and then booking

76
00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.500
of appointments can actually happen.
Yeah, that's exactly right. So,

77
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.700
so we integrate to many
of the practice management systems

78
00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.280
that doctors use today. So
we have this, you know,

79
00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.820
this automated synchronized system. So,
so that their availability is

80
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.250
avail is, you know, correct
in real time on our

81
00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.160
website, What kind of systems
are those? Like, what are,

82
00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.990
what are these doctors running?
Are these things all running

83
00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.350
clipper and like dos prompt
or what practice management system?

84
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.320
Yeah. It's interesting that you
asked that. I mean, most,

85
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.570
you know, a lot of
the practice managers systems are

86
00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.480
very archaic, you know, to
be fair, a lot of

87
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.140
them have, have upgraded their
systems quite a bit, but

88
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.350
a lot of doctors don't
upgrade when the, you know,

89
00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.900
when the vendors put out
new systems. So a lot

90
00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.140
of these doctors on old
systems and, and, you know,

91
00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.350
some of them are green
screen, et cetera. And, you

92
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.710
know, part of our engineering
efforts at Zoc doc is

93
00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.310
to integrate to things that
aren't built, you know, in

94
00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.600
a, you know, web 2.0
world, or, you know, there

95
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.310
there's, there's applications that store
things in, you know, in

96
00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.470
old binary file formats and
stuff. And we go in

97
00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.990
and we figure out those
formats and we create integrations

98
00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.720
to those system. So that
certainly from my perspective makes

99
00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.810
the engineering problem that you're
solving like much harder. Like

100
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.600
I immediately thought to myself,
Oh, it's match.com for doctors

101
00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.120
and patients. The doctors pay,
you know, it's like the

102
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.340
club, right? The ladies get
in free, the men pay.

103
00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:40.350
And except suddenly the ongoing
relationship becomes one of a

104
00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:44.490
very complicated you're plugging in
different API APIs, all into

105
00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.510
your aggregate API, but not
all of those practice management

106
00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:50.280
systems are in the cloud.
That will be a good

107
00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.280
number of them. Aren't there
packages locally that never expected

108
00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.000
to ever give their scheduling
data out, do the doctors

109
00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.410
to say, Oh, I've got,
I've got Hansel doc installed.

110
00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:01.780
And it runs in clipper.
I need to go in

111
00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:03.890
and install a windows service
from Zoc doc to go

112
00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:05.810
and suck that flat file
out and send it up.

113
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.670
And are you suddenly writing
software like that? Absolutely. Absolutely.

114
00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.190
So we're, you know, I
mean, you know, some of

115
00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:14.350
my guys are sitting there
staring at the matrix, they're

116
00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:17.560
staring at hex files, you
know, in a hex editor

117
00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.560
and unwinding where that data
is stored. So it's quite

118
00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.430
a challenging problem. And I
mean, but it's also a

119
00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:28.540
good thing, right? I mean,
if, if every practice management

120
00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:32.470
system has some super clean
API, then we wouldn't really

121
00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:33.910
have a business. Right. This
is the hard thing that

122
00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:37.630
we're doing that makes us
sort of, you know, hopefully

123
00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:39.850
unique in this area. Yeah.
And that's where the value

124
00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:41.530
comes in. I mean, that's
where a doctor is going

125
00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:42.910
to say, well, why am
I paying you money? It's

126
00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:44.740
like, well, Hey, I just
got canceled doc to talk

127
00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:46.600
to our backend services. And
you just turn into a

128
00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.360
web 2.0, doctor, you should
be happy about that, doc.

129
00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:55.030
Yeah. Yeah. It's interesting because
you know, our web interface

130
00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:59.320
is, is more modern and
is more, you know, user-friendly

131
00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.450
than, than some of these
old archaic systems. And so

132
00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:03.160
some of these doctors are
actually, once we get the

133
00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.370
integration working, they're actually using
our interface instead of the

134
00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:09.520
own interface that came with
the system, Which is actually

135
00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:14.530
a little scary. Can, can
they actually replace their, a

136
00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:17.290
practice management system or at
least their appointment scheduler with

137
00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:19.420
your stuff? Because I would
think it's one thing to

138
00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.090
write an agent and a
custom thing that sucks out

139
00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:25.060
some bee tree file from
an old system and sends

140
00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:27.070
it up in a read
only fashion, but to actually

141
00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:31.030
poke into a system, even
a multi-user one, that's not

142
00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:33.550
expecting someone to be talking
to it. You know, how

143
00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:36.340
was your software doing the
synchronization? Is that nightly? Or

144
00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.460
I thought that's an hairy
engineering problem. I would think

145
00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:42.670
It's absolutely every engineering problem.
And no, it's not nightly,

146
00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:46.240
it's real time integration with
these, with these doctor's offices.

147
00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:52.780
And, and yeah, I mean,
basically it's, it's not a

148
00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:55.900
trivial engineering problem and this
is why we're here at

149
00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:57.990
Stanford, you know, career fair.
We're trying to get the

150
00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:00.070
strong guys to come in
and help us with. Yeah.

151
00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:01.330
And, and you're, and you
guys are, you guys are

152
00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:03.030
hiring and it sounds like
you have high a high

153
00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:06.580
bar, but certainly people could
contact you if they think

154
00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:09.670
that they're hardcore enough to
stare at the matrix. What

155
00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:11.590
is your, what is your
stack like, what is your

156
00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:14.500
system run? Oh, sure. So
it's, you know, it's a,

157
00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:18.370
it's a very, you know,
it's a, purist's Microsoft stack.

158
00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:23.740
You could say it's a
SQL server running on, you

159
00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:29.590
know, windows server 2008 and,
and, you know, I S

160
00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:34.540
and asp.net, but we're moving,
you know, we're, we're moving

161
00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:39.670
towards MBC three and, and,
and it's all sharp. Are

162
00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:41.230
you doing, you're doing web
forms now, or are you

163
00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:46.900
doing a different earlier version
of MVC Web forums in

164
00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.270
the sense that we use
the, you know, the Microsoft's,

165
00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:53.140
you know, ASP, colon form,
that kind of stuff, right.

166
00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:55.860
It's sort of, you know,
if, look at our sort

167
00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:59.970
of search results page, it's
it's way too, you know,

168
00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:02.970
complex for that. It's very,
you know, Ajax, sickle and

169
00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:07.020
very sort of real time
updating. And so we've written

170
00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:09.750
a lot of custom, you
know, it's a lot of

171
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:12.420
percent equals, right? It's a
lot of open bracket percent

172
00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:16.860
equals kind of custom stuff
to make the Ajax really

173
00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:19.040
look fun and animated and
et cetera. I see. So

174
00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:21.080
it was a control thing.
It sounds like, it sounds

175
00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.120
like you guys need control
stuff. I mean, you're editing,

176
00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:25.610
you're looking at hex type
dumps and you're writing little

177
00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:27.680
services on the, on the
one side, and then you

178
00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:31.100
really wanted serious down to
the bite control on the

179
00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:32.930
client, on the, you know,
as far as the, the

180
00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:36.140
angle brackets that came out
the wire. Yeah, exactly, exactly.

181
00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:38.120
I mean, we've, you know,
we've even done steps to,

182
00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:41.900
you know, to minimize cookies
and minimize the upload of

183
00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:44.390
cookies. And, you know, we
want to make sure an

184
00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:48.980
HTTP get request fits in
one packet. Right. And so,

185
00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:50.480
you know, these are the
levels of tunings that we're

186
00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:53.240
doing because of the amount
of traffic that we, that

187
00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:56.210
we serve. And so, you
know, we, we really kind

188
00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:59.960
of hand, you know, fine
tune the, the optimization of

189
00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:02.660
this stuff. Now I PR
people know that I work

190
00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:06.890
for Microsoft, although the podcast
is mine and Carl Franklin. So

191
00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:09.860
while I do have Microsoft
people in Microsoft technologists on

192
00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:12.020
the show a lot, you
know, I try to keep

193
00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:14.570
it real. And it's interesting
to me that you're a,

194
00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:16.940
you're a mature startup. You're
a couple of years into

195
00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:19.520
it now, is that right?
Yeah. We, we started in

196
00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:23.540
2006 And, but, you know,
you're, you're still not giant,

197
00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:25.910
right. Would you say it's
taken off and you've like,

198
00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:28.700
you've succeeded. Is it finished
or are you, would you

199
00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:31.430
still call yourself? Where are
you in the maturity of

200
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:33.950
startups, I guess? Sure. You
know, I would say we're,

201
00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:35.660
you know, we're in the,
we're in the growth phase

202
00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:37.760
right now. I think that,
you know, the business model

203
00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.950
works, you know, the doctors
like it, they get new

204
00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:43.370
patients, patients of course love
it because they can search

205
00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:45.380
by any criteria, whether, you
know, doctors be able in

206
00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:47.720
the evening or whether they
take some obscure insurance plan,

207
00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:51.320
et cetera. And so, you
know, the business model works

208
00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:52.910
and I think we're just,
you know, we're just trying

209
00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:54.380
to scale it right now.
So we're just trying to,

210
00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:59.750
you know, launch in, in,
you know, we're launching city

211
00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:01.760
after city in, in the
U S and just trying

212
00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.440
to get scale right now.
Okay. So back to my

213
00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:07.190
point about working for Microsoft,
I don't, I'm not trying

214
00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:08.930
to be a Microsoft apologist
and kind of be like

215
00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:11.090
I say, keep it real,
but I don't usually think

216
00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:13.100
of people who go to
Stan, you know, startups that

217
00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:17.450
go to Stanford jobs fairs
as being Microsoft. You don't

218
00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:19.520
think of Microsoft being in
the Bay area, you and

219
00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:22.850
on frankly, just be, let's
be Frank. I don't see

220
00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:26.450
a lot of young startups
using Microsoft products until recently

221
00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:28.730
with this BizSpark thing where
they give it away, they

222
00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:30.770
give a lot of stuff
away for free. It, has

223
00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:32.750
that been a challenge for
you? What's your opinion of

224
00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:36.950
like Microsoft as it relates
to the startup community? Yeah.

225
00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:38.750
I mean, for sure it's
been a challenge, it, you

226
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:41.930
know, for you guys to,
to, to get some traction

227
00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:45.260
in, in the startup community,
you know, I think part

228
00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.350
of it is, you know,
the, of course before BizSpark,

229
00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:50.960
you know, if, if it's
two guys in a room

230
00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.650
with no budget, you know,
they have the money to

231
00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:56.710
shell out for SQL server
enterprise and et cetera. And

232
00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:59.440
so, you know, that was
reason. One, I think reason

233
00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:02.920
two is kind of this
dogmatic, you know, Microsoft, Oh,

234
00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:06.130
those, you know, those guys,
those, you know, those empire

235
00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:09.400
guys, I'm glad you said
it, cause I didn't want

236
00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:12.160
to say it, you know?
And so part of it's

237
00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.200
dogmatic from that point of
view, and of course that's

238
00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:17.680
not, you know, that's never
a good decision. That's never

239
00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:20.110
a good criteria to, you
know, to base any decision.

240
00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:22.960
You know, I sort of
didn't feel that way. And

241
00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:26.440
I wanted to make an
objective evaluation of, of different

242
00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:29.290
technologies when we started in
2007. And, you know, I

243
00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:32.770
came from a Java background
and of course C-sharp is,

244
00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:35.200
you know, very similar to
Java has quite a few

245
00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:38.080
improvements. Of course, I'd probably
get in trouble just for

246
00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:41.530
saying that, but, but you
know, we love C sharp

247
00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:46.540
and, and I think the,
you know, the, the static

248
00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:50.380
nature of, of C-sharp and
Java and that family of

249
00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:53.860
languages that is, you know,
sort of statically bound, I

250
00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:56.650
think that stuff will really
save you when you do

251
00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:59.950
get to scale. So, you
know, we're at 20 engineers

252
00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:03.490
now we're looking to get
to 40 very quickly and,

253
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:07.090
and, you know, the static
nature of it allows you

254
00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:09.100
to do these compile time
checks and even, you know,

255
00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:11.390
the static code analysis tools
such as FX cop and

256
00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:17.800
independ really allow us to,
you know, ensure code quality

257
00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:21.490
at a highly automated level,
which is really kind of

258
00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:24.070
a savior when, you know,
when you're scaling your engineering

259
00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:26.260
team this quickly. And I
think that, you know, these

260
00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:30.190
dynamic languages, you know, Python,
Ruby, and now of course,

261
00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:34.450
Java script with node. I
think that if you're not

262
00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:37.120
really, really careful, you can
get to a lot of

263
00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:39.520
trouble when you get into
a large, large code base

264
00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:42.250
and have multiple, you know,
lots of developers all crowded

265
00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:45.610
around the same code base,
doing things really quickly. I

266
00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:48.160
think the dynamic nature of
that can kind of lead

267
00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:51.870
to spaghetti unless you're very,
very disciplined about, Well, I've

268
00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:54.810
said before though, pushing, pushing
back a little bit, that,

269
00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:58.020
that I felt that compilation
was just the first unit

270
00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:00.840
test. And it's almost like
a spell check, right. It

271
00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:03.120
doesn't tell you if this
is grammatically correct or semantically

272
00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:05.160
correct or correct at all,
but it does tell you

273
00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:10.590
that it's spelled, right. Do
you think that you thinking

274
00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:12.120
about things in terms of
the compiler, or are you

275
00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:15.540
thinking more in, like you
mentioned independent and static code

276
00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:18.420
analysis, are you using things
like code contracts? Because I

277
00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:20.790
think it is true that
compilation is really simply a

278
00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:24.600
syntactic unit check, but if
you really start being introspective

279
00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:26.550
and looking at the code,
whether it be with aspect

280
00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:30.450
oriented, different things or code
contracts, you can learn a

281
00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:33.360
lot about what's going on
and you can basically save

282
00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.340
yourself, put in a safety
net. I mean, do you

283
00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:38.910
have that level of formalization
in your system? Yeah. You

284
00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:41.370
know, let me give you
an example. So, you know,

285
00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:47.700
we wrote our own SQL
level interface to interface with

286
00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:51.980
SQL server. So micro ORM,
micro ORM, and we can

287
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:55.640
get into, into how that
works in a minute, but,

288
00:14:55.670 --> 00:15:00.500
but basically, you know, we've
replaced SQL command with our

289
00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:03.890
own, you know, Zoc doc
SQL command, which basically, you

290
00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:05.990
know, it's not rocket science.
It just, it, it owns

291
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:08.600
a SQL command inside it
and it passes all the

292
00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:12.350
calls along. But, but since
it, you know, intercepts those

293
00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:14.810
calls, we can add things
later. Like, you know, you

294
00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:19.010
can measure how many SQL
commands you're executing per second

295
00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:20.750
or per minute, or, you
know, you can see which

296
00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:24.740
ones are hogging, SQL server,
et cetera, et cetera. And

297
00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:28.100
so, you know, that's a
library that's really useful now,

298
00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:30.890
of course, that doesn't stop
someone from still saying, you

299
00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:33.200
know, new SQL connection, a
new SQL command in our

300
00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:36.050
code base. But if you
have FX cop, you can

301
00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:39.170
just say, you know, at
the build time in the

302
00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:44.060
continuous integration process, you say,
you know, you can't call

303
00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:47.540
the constructor of SQL command.
And so that way, if,

304
00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:50.510
if, if an engineer forgets
or it's a new engineer,

305
00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:53.990
who's, you know, somehow didn't
get that guideline the second

306
00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:56.000
day. Right? One of those
that instantly says, no, you

307
00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.650
know, you shouldn't be doing
that. You should be writing

308
00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:00.380
Zoc doc SQL command instead
of, you know, the Microsoft

309
00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:04.340
SQL command. And so you
enforced that level of, of,

310
00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:08.570
you know, code accuracy right
there so that nobody can

311
00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:11.080
write a SQL command and,
and sort of bypass the,

312
00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:13.250
the system that we've set
up to do the self

313
00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:18.220
profiling. Hi, this is Scott
coming to you from another

314
00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:21.550
place in time. Are you
using agile practices to manage

315
00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:23.800
your software development? There's lots
of tools in the market

316
00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:25.810
that manage the steps of
a project, but most of

317
00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:29.050
them focus on individual roles,
get ready for a solution

318
00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:31.480
that caters for the success
of the whole team guys

319
00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:35.350
at Tellerik introduced team pulse.

332
00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:23.410
R I K Tellerik. We
do appreciate it. They wouldn't

333
00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:25.240
be a handsome and it's,
if there wasn't teller helping

334
00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:29.230
us, I've always thought that
that FX cop was one

335
00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:31.900
of those things. It wasn't
used enough, but I felt

336
00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:33.490
a little bit like it
was too hard to write

337
00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:35.830
a role and maybe it
was just my own laziness,

338
00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:38.350
but I just felt like
there'd be this utopia where

339
00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:40.660
I would have like 30
or 40 good solid FX

340
00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:42.490
cop rules that would just
kind of just tighten the

341
00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:45.480
screws a little bit, make
things a little tinier. How

342
00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:47.380
many do you have, and
did you find it difficult

343
00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:51.020
to build up a library
of FX cop rolls? Yeah.

344
00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:52.790
You know, there's a balance.
I think there's, there's a

345
00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:57.860
video somewhere where, you know,
someone has written, someone works

346
00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:00.620
somewhere where they have, you
know, a hundred FX cop

347
00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:03.650
rules and they write something
that's three lines. And then

348
00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:06.020
it says, you know, you
haven't initialized this variable and

349
00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:08.360
you haven't done this thing.
And it complains so much

350
00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:12.080
that by the time they're
finished, you know, making all

351
00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:15.260
the ethics rules, ethics, cop
rules, happy, the thing has

352
00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:18.050
swelled to like 25 lines
from three lines. And so

353
00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:20.060
you have to find, and
so, you know, you have

354
00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:24.920
to find this balance of,
of, you know, enforcing what

355
00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:27.890
you want, but not making
the rules so arduous or

356
00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:30.770
overreaching that, you know, it's
just this giant pain just

357
00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:33.500
to get things to work
with FX cop. So, so

358
00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:35.450
it's an interesting balance and
it's something that, you know,

359
00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:38.990
that we, we tune every
day. But, you know, to

360
00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:41.390
just give you, you know,
the short answer is that

361
00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:43.280
most of our FX cup
rules are really, really simple

362
00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:46.100
like that. We've, you know,
we just sort of, you

363
00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:47.660
know, we don't want anyone
using SQL command. So we

364
00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:50.210
have our Zoc doc come
in and we don't, you

365
00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:52.970
know, we've written our own
in the MVC world. We've

366
00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:56.900
written our own doc doc
controller that overrides or inherits

367
00:18:56.900 --> 00:19:00.530
from the regular controller. And
we don't want anyone to

368
00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:02.900
use the regular controller. You
know, we don't want anyone

369
00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:04.580
to extend the regular controller.
We want them all to

370
00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:07.160
extend the Zocdoc controller. So,
you know, that's another rule.

371
00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:09.740
You can't extend controller, you
have to extend the.dot controller.

372
00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:14.160
And so it's just those
kinds of rules that allows

373
00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:16.130
us to have that consistency.
And then of course the

374
00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:18.800
doc dot controller can do
the same. It's analogous to

375
00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:22.130
the Zoc doc SQL command
in that it can, you

376
00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:25.010
know, it'll, it'll do its
own profiling and seeing, you

377
00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:26.870
know, if one page is
getting hit exceptionally hard, et

378
00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:30.110
cetera. So it sounds like
though you have a very

379
00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:33.920
specific business model, but you're
describing a few things like

380
00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:37.640
a standard doc doc specific
controller, it's doc doc specific

381
00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:43.760
SQL connection that are solving
problems that are not specific

382
00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:47.360
to patients and doctors, which
I think seems to be

383
00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:49.010
a startup thing. I don't
know if it's a young

384
00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:50.990
person thing or a startup
or startup thing, but the

385
00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:54.200
idea of, well, we're gonna
start a startup and it's

386
00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:57.140
gonna, it's gonna marry doctors
and patients, but first we

387
00:19:57.140 --> 00:19:59.570
need a logging component. And
then from there, like, you

388
00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:02.750
know, the not invented here
happens. Did you see that

389
00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:05.360
happen as a startup? And
is that part of the

390
00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.850
shorter process or part of
the.net ecosystem that caused that?

391
00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:12.440
Yeah, I mean, I think
you're, you're completely right. You

392
00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:14.840
know, these problems are not,
are not specific to us.

393
00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:19.160
You know, we have the
micro RM and the Zoc

394
00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:22.100
doc controller, like you said,
are absolutely things that would

395
00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:24.770
be useful to more than
just us. And they are

396
00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:27.890
sort of generic tools. You
know, we do want to

397
00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:29.570
open source these kinds of
things. And I think we

398
00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:31.070
will, as soon as we
get the bandwidth to kind

399
00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:32.930
of just clean them up
and make them presented to

400
00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:36.500
the, to the community, certainly
we're not philosophically opposed to

401
00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:41.810
open sourcing our generic things.
And, and you're right. You

402
00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:44.330
know, it's interesting that, you
know, stack overflow is down

403
00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:47.860
the street from us in
New York city and reading through

404
00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:50.080
their blogs. I found that
we were inventing some of

405
00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:53.950
these generic things in parallel
to them. And so, you

406
00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:56.140
know, I ran into Joel
at, at, at one of

407
00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:59.620
these, you know, startup-y convention
type things. And I told

408
00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:01.180
him, I was like, Hey,
look, we're doing some of

409
00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:04.000
the same things here. And,
and then I had a

410
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000
long conversation with Mark Ravel
about, you know, the micro

411
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.400
ORM that they've built, you
know, the, you know, they

412
00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:13.990
built a stamper micro RM,
which was almost identical to

413
00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:16.900
the one that we came
up with independently, as well

414
00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:21.520
as the, the mini profiler
that they wrote. And we

415
00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:25.000
came up with the same
thing independently. And so yeah,

416
00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:28.930
a lot of these tools
should be used by more

417
00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:32.290
companies and I'm not sure
why, I'm not sure why,

418
00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:34.990
you know, in 2010 and
2011, that we have to

419
00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:39.480
invent these things. Do you
think it's specific to.net or

420
00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:41.430
do you think it's just
startup stuff? The reason I,

421
00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:43.230
or just people just, you
know, I want to write

422
00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:44.760
my own thing because I'm
trying to get my head

423
00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:48.120
around that, that I know
I've talked to two Ruby

424
00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:51.150
guys and they'll say, Oh,
well, we did this, we

425
00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:52.920
did that. And this is
the best practice, but, you

426
00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:54.990
know, we didn't feel there
was anything in the universe

427
00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:56.700
that would meet our needs
and then they go off

428
00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:58.380
and they write something from
scratch. You know, it doesn't

429
00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:01.380
seem to me to be
specific to covid.net. I mean,

430
00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:04.530
I know that everybody though
wants to blaze a new

431
00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:06.930
trail, even on old things.
There's a story that I've

432
00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:10.290
told before about how I
was working in finance. And

433
00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:13.800
we were doing online retail
banking, which is extremely specific.

434
00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:17.640
And one of the young
men wanted to create a

435
00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:20.160
dropdown, a calendar dropdown control.
And he's like, I'm going

436
00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:21.690
to spend the next two
days where he can get

437
00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:24.570
the world's greatest dropdown control.
And I just had to

438
00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:27.780
remind them, we're not a
component vendor. We hate there's

439
00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:30.000
component vendors that will do
that. And here's one for

440
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.570
$400. So let's say you're
valued at a hundred dollars

441
00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:35.790
an hour. You have exactly
four hours to write the

442
00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:38.040
world's greatest one. Otherwise I'm
just going to buy it,

443
00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:41.460
you know, keeping focused on
the business as something that

444
00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:43.350
you, as a CTO need
to do. How do you,

445
00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:44.850
how do you find that
balance? And do you think

446
00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:48.510
it's specific to Danette? Yeah,
I think that, yeah, I

447
00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:50.730
mean, what you're saying is
Kurt is absolutely right. And,

448
00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:53.310
you know, we shouldn't be
building things that, that we

449
00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:56.760
can buy or that are,
you know, open sourced. You

450
00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:59.310
know, one of my friends,
David Padbury, who's a, it

451
00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:04.380
was quite a Danette expert
here in New York, made an

452
00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:08.370
interesting observation, which was that
stack overflow in us. We're

453
00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:10.290
in the, we're in the
minority in terms of the

454
00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:14.190
market, because there's not a
lot of companies that do

455
00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:18.350
get this volume of traffic.
And so, you know, a

456
00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:23.430
solution like hibernate might work
for them because they don't

457
00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:26.910
need to have such fine
tuned control over the SQL.

458
00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:28.800
You know, if it comes
up with something that's a

459
00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:31.770
little bit inefficient, it's probably
okay. And so this micro

460
00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:34.320
RM thing really comes out
of us needing to hand

461
00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:38.040
tune our own SQL and
not to have, you know,

462
00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:39.930
have the risk that the
ORM comes up with something

463
00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:42.930
inefficient. And, but, you know,
for, I'd say for most

464
00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:47.240
companies, you know, that's probably
okay because they're not getting

465
00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:50.240
the, you know, the, the
millions of hits that, that

466
00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:54.080
stack overflow or us get.
And so, and so, you

467
00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:56.750
know, perhaps there hasn't been
such a market, such a

468
00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:59.930
huge market for this micro
or M that, you know,

469
00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:03.110
that, that some company came
up with a solution for

470
00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:05.180
it, and that's why we're
inventing it. And the other

471
00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:08.000
thing is that the, you
know, like you said, there's

472
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.730
just not a lot of
startupy, you know, sort of

473
00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:16.280
high traffic.net websites in general.
And so, you know, so

474
00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:18.380
I guess there hasn't been
a huge market need for,

475
00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:21.280
for a micro ORM. Yeah.
There are definitely a lot

476
00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:25.930
of big dotnet sites as
I move around the community

477
00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:28.210
and visit a lot of
folks. I find that it's

478
00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:31.330
just that we haven't heard
of them. Right. You know,

479
00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:33.670
there's a lot of big
sites that just don't, that

480
00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:36.190
are big enterprises that don't
talk about stuff. I was

481
00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:39.640
at a, at a very
large local shoe company here

482
00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:41.440
in Portland, whose name you
would have heard of. And

483
00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:44.650
they were doing something in.net
and they were saying, all

484
00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:45.940
right, well, you gotta need
to go do this very

485
00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:50.050
specific shoe thing. And let's
talk about logging. And it

486
00:24:50.050 --> 00:24:53.650
got me wondering, is that
a problem that Microsoft should

487
00:24:53.650 --> 00:24:56.500
solve? Is that a problem
that open source has solved

488
00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:57.940
and they should just go
and use log for net,

489
00:24:57.940 --> 00:24:59.980
or is it, they should
go and use the logging

490
00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:03.730
blocks, the enterprise blocks from
Microsoft, or did.net not come

491
00:25:03.730 --> 00:25:07.030
out of the box with
enough something, you know, it

492
00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:08.230
was kind of a damned
if you do damned if

493
00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:11.650
you don't situation there where
we might release something and

494
00:25:11.650 --> 00:25:14.350
find it wanting, and then
people will just pull it

495
00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:17.650
out and use their own
thing, or we produce nothing

496
00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:19.390
at all. And then people
don't use logging at all.

497
00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:22.210
Yeah. I mean, you know,
I can tell you that

498
00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:25.300
it's another good example of,
because, you know, we wrote

499
00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:28.510
our own simple logging thing.
And the reason is because

500
00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:30.100
if we use one of
the, you know, one of

501
00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:33.640
the existing logging packages, you
know, for example, we want

502
00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:36.340
to just count all our
hits. Right. And so if

503
00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:37.960
we use one of the,
one of the basic logging

504
00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:41.680
packages, it would just be
writing so many hits because

505
00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:43.360
it's just the nature of
how much we get per

506
00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:47.680
second. And so, you know,
we wrote a logging, you

507
00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:50.260
know, again, it's simple, like
it sort of falls under

508
00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:52.840
the rule that you said,
like, you know, if your

509
00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:54.850
rate is a hundred dollars
an hour, then you, you

510
00:25:54.850 --> 00:25:56.500
know, you can spend eight
hours on this and you're

511
00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:59.950
probably still, you know, okay.
So it's that level of,

512
00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:04.630
you know, of simplicity, but
it has to aggregate before

513
00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:07.210
it, even before it writes
anything. Right. Because otherwise, if

514
00:26:07.210 --> 00:26:09.520
it was writing every time
we asked it to log,

515
00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:12.430
it would just constantly be
writing to disk and, you

516
00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:14.080
know, the files would get
huge and they, you know,

517
00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:16.270
they would get fragmented and
then, you know, the disc

518
00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:18.850
would start thrashing and et
cetera. And so this thing

519
00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:23.290
aggregates before it writes anything
to disc and right, so

520
00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:25.270
it'll say, you know, it
won't write every time you

521
00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:28.180
got to hit on, on
the homepage, right? It'll, it'll

522
00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:30.580
count the number of hits
you get on the homepage

523
00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:32.680
and then write that once
a minute or et cetera.

524
00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:37.420
And so, you know, rather
than try to figure out

525
00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:39.700
how to get that to
happen in, in one of

526
00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:41.770
existing logging frameworks, it, you
know, it was only a

527
00:26:41.770 --> 00:26:43.980
few hours of our time
to get that, to work

528
00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:47.150
in a simple logging system.
Someone mentioned a term to

529
00:26:47.150 --> 00:26:49.490
me recently, I thought it
was really interesting and they

530
00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:52.730
called it decision fatigue. And
they said that one of

531
00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:56.720
the things that catches programmers
by surprise, especially as they,

532
00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:58.370
as they kind of get
older or they get under

533
00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:01.190
the gun, get, you know,
get pressure put upon them,

534
00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:04.220
is that the actual fatigue
of having to make a

535
00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:08.150
decision. So like in your
example, we could go and

536
00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:10.820
we know exactly what the
problem is. We know exactly

537
00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:13.460
how to solve it. We
could go and do all

538
00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:16.280
of the, the analysis and
the work, and perhaps the

539
00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:19.670
legal leg work to figure
out if we can use

540
00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:21.590
this or that or the
other thing, or we could

541
00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:25.640
go and do a big
procurement thing. It's funny to

542
00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:28.070
go and put together the
$500, one would need to

543
00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:30.950
purchase a piece of software,
not to mention the financial

544
00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:34.730
analysis of whether it's the
correct software is, is a

545
00:27:34.730 --> 00:27:36.710
huge amount of effort to
get 500 bucks to go

546
00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:39.260
and buy a piece of
software, but a developer can

547
00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:43.940
burn five hours by taking
a really long lunch. Yeah.

548
00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:46.970
Yeah. I mean, that's an
interesting observation, you know, we

549
00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:50.600
don't, you know, we're not
at that size yet where,

550
00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:53.270
you know, we need to
sort of have, you know,

551
00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:55.990
procurement, if something costs $500,
I'll, I'll just, you know,

552
00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:57.860
I'll just buy it on
my, or my credit card

553
00:27:58.010 --> 00:27:59.690
on my, you know, my
corporate credit card. And we

554
00:27:59.690 --> 00:28:02.180
won't go through a diet,
a giant decision process there.

555
00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:04.700
So hopefully we never, you
know, we never get into

556
00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:06.980
the situation where we're filling
out procurement request forms and

557
00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:09.320
things, Well, somewhere around a
hundred employees, I think that's

558
00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:10.640
going to happen to you.
There's nothing you're gonna be

559
00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:12.290
able to do. No, we
should, we should talk again

560
00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:14.180
in a, in a few
months and I'll let you

561
00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:20.900
know how it's turned out,
but, but yeah, certainly evaluating,

562
00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:23.870
you know, all of the
logging systems and picking one

563
00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:27.680
would be, you know, even
if they're all free, it's

564
00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:28.850
a few hours, you know,
it's at least a few

565
00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:32.270
hours by itself. Right. And
so to also just build

566
00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:34.280
it yourself in a few
hours, something that, you know,

567
00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:38.660
will just work is not,
is not outlandish when you,

568
00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:40.850
you know, of course, you
know, there's exceptions to it,

569
00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:42.200
right? Like we're not going
to write our own Jason

570
00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:44.990
serializer because that would, that
would not be a four

571
00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:47.300
hour project. Right. That would
be a big project. And

572
00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:49.850
so, you know, you have
to make that decision about,

573
00:28:49.910 --> 00:28:53.420
you know, whether it's, it
is in fact, a few

574
00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:56.570
hour project, Is that, is
that the limb, is that

575
00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:59.780
the litmus test, how, how
many hours it will take

576
00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:02.720
to go and do this
thing? Yeah. I mean, you

577
00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:04.550
know, if you think about
the right, so take them

578
00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:06.890
out. The Jason serializer right
there, there's, there's one that

579
00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:10.580
works already and it does
what we need. It does,

580
00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:12.470
you know, it, it, it
does it at the speed

581
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:16.100
we needed at the scale.
We need it. And, and,

582
00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:18.830
and, and to write one,
yourself would actually be fairly

583
00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:21.170
complicated because of, you know,
if you start thinking about

584
00:29:21.170 --> 00:29:24.020
object graphs and, you know,
you have to like recursively

585
00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:27.770
follow, you know, the object
graph, but then, you know,

586
00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:30.140
a child object could point
to his parent also. So

587
00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:31.850
you have to not like
go back up the tree

588
00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:34.220
and, you know, it could
get quite complicated quite quick.

589
00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:39.170
And so, and so, you
know, in that situation, you

590
00:29:39.170 --> 00:29:42.550
know, we're not going to
write own Jason serializer and,

591
00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:46.630
and, you know, because it's
not, you know, a few

592
00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:50.110
hour project. And so, you
know, you have to make

593
00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:52.330
that, you know, you have
to make that judgment call,

594
00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:56.770
but, you know, hopefully we're,
we're evaluating properly and making

595
00:29:56.770 --> 00:29:59.970
the right calls there. It's
definitely sounds like a lot

596
00:29:59.970 --> 00:30:02.310
of challenge. And how big
are you guys now after,

597
00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:05.640
after three or four years?
Yeah, so, you know, we

598
00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:10.830
just did our, our, our
series C you know, 50,

599
00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.400
we raised a $50 million round
from DST. You have to,

600
00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:15.810
you're gonna have to back
up and remember that. Not

601
00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:17.670
only do a lot of
our listeners not know the

602
00:30:17.670 --> 00:30:20.700
startup world, but they're not
going to know those acronyms.

603
00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:23.880
So what's the series C
what's DST and congratulations on

604
00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:27.180
$15 million. Oh, thanks. Sorry. Yeah,
sometimes I get so caught

605
00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:31.950
up in, in our own
startup world. So series C

606
00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:34.920
means it's our third round
of funding. We take an

607
00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:39.480
investment of $50 million from a
company called, you know, from,

608
00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:45.360
from an investor called DST
and DST is, you know,

609
00:30:45.450 --> 00:30:49.680
they're invested in Facebook and
Twitter, Airbnb, and a couple

610
00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:54.090
of, you know, sort of
other high profile, high profile

611
00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:57.480
websites. So, so we're very
excited to have them as

612
00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:02.550
a partner and we're moving
forward with them. And in

613
00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:05.970
terms of head count, you
know, we're about 150, probably

614
00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.580
a little bit more. That
was, that was as of

615
00:31:08.850 --> 00:31:12.870
last month and about 20
engineers. But like I said,

616
00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:14.700
we're trying to get to
40 very, very quickly here.

617
00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:17.700
And then, and then 80
after that. So there's a

618
00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:21.480
lot of interesting engineering challenges
here. And so we're trying

619
00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:24.750
to grow that team very
quickly. Wow. That's great. And

620
00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:26.550
how long did this take?
I mean, w what is

621
00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:28.140
the, what is the power
curve look like? I mean,

622
00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:29.700
were you just like, it
was you and a buddy

623
00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:31.500
and a garage, and now
you're 150 people. How did

624
00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:33.810
that happen over the last
four years? Yeah, absolutely. And,

625
00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:35.760
you know, sometimes I get
kind of a vertigo and

626
00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:38.250
I think about it, but
that's absolutely how it started.

627
00:31:38.250 --> 00:31:42.450
We started in 2007, you
know, my co founder was

628
00:31:42.450 --> 00:31:44.880
on an airplane and his,
and his eardrum burst when

629
00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:49.590
they landed. And so he
was in severe pain, severe

630
00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:52.620
ear pain, and could not
find a doctor in New York

631
00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:56.280
city that would see him
an ear nose, throat doctor.

632
00:31:56.730 --> 00:31:58.920
And he was like, this
is ridiculous. There's gotta be,

633
00:31:59.430 --> 00:32:02.280
you know, some ear, nose,
throat doctor in Manhattan that

634
00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:06.450
has, you know, the availability
to see me. And, but

635
00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:09.660
he couldn't find one. So,
so he contacted me and

636
00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:11.460
said, you know, we should
both quit our jobs and

637
00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:13.650
do this. So it was,
and, you know, we have

638
00:32:13.650 --> 00:32:16.800
a third co founder who
was a former doctor. And

639
00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:18.810
so it was just the
three of us in a

640
00:32:18.810 --> 00:32:25.650
room for, you know, for
almost a year. And, and,

641
00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:27.900
you know, and then it,
it, you know, we did

642
00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:32.520
our first round of, of
funding in late 2008. And

643
00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:34.410
then, you know, then it
kind of took off from

644
00:32:34.410 --> 00:32:40.460
there. Aye, aye, aye. Aye.
I, I did that for

645
00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:42.890
awhile. I did that. How
many, how many, I'm trying

646
00:32:42.890 --> 00:32:46.370
to think, how many internet
bubbles ago, you know, like

647
00:32:46.370 --> 00:32:52.160
94 and 95, eight hundred.com
gear.com. You know, we just

648
00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:53.660
had a good time. It
was just like the pre

649
00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:55.730
Amazon, right. When, you know,
when you could do anything,

650
00:32:55.730 --> 00:32:57.890
you know, like when, when
all you needed to do

651
00:32:57.890 --> 00:33:00.590
a startup was a domain
name and all you need

652
00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:03.200
now is a domain name
without a vowel, you know,

653
00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:07.540
so many things. Yeah, yeah,
yeah. That's right. Yeah. I'm

654
00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:09.600
actually, you know, I was
actually around for that, that

655
00:33:09.610 --> 00:33:12.400
first iteration as well. I
was, you know, I was

656
00:33:12.790 --> 00:33:15.970
in the Bay area in
99 and I did a

657
00:33:15.970 --> 00:33:19.060
couple of startups that didn't
do, didn't do that. Great.

658
00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:21.850
But, but I was, you
know, I remember those heady

659
00:33:21.850 --> 00:33:25.510
times as well, So fun.
I think I got, like,

660
00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:27.970
I had a couple of
investments in a couple of

661
00:33:27.970 --> 00:33:29.980
release startups. I think like
the biggest startup that I

662
00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:34.150
did was like, I made
$2,500 on mail.com. You know,

663
00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:37.750
like, you know, mail.com went
big and get big, was

664
00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:39.730
like, you know, a couple
of grand for the contractors.

665
00:33:39.730 --> 00:33:43.450
So it's like a job.
Yeah. I never saw any

666
00:33:43.450 --> 00:33:47.470
big exits out of those
either. So hopefully this is

667
00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:49.090
the one that thinks doc
doc is, you know, it's

668
00:33:49.090 --> 00:33:52.150
doing well. So, so Well,
