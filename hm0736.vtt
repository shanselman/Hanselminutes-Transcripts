today@raygun.com. That's our a Y
G U n.com. Hello? Hello.

11
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.010
You're the first person in
the history of Hanselman it's

12
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.640
to open the show before
I said, hi, this is

13
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.620
Scott Hanselman. This is another
episode of Hanselminutes today. I'm

14
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.810
talking to Cassidy Williams, but
you said instead. Hello? I

15
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.150
did. And that was mostly
because I wasn't sure if

16
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.120
you wanted me to or
not. I think it will

17
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.160
become the official opening. Just
held the show. Hello. How

18
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.380
are you? Because when I,
when we got on the

19
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.010
recording system here we use
Zencaster for recording. You immediately

20
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.780
switched from hi, how's it
going? Hello. And you went

21
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.990
to your NPR national public
radio voice, and I appreciate

22
00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.750
that. Yeah, you bet. You
gotta be ready to context

23
00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.320
switch. It's it's both in
technical and in recording situation,

24
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.840
You do that very well.
I am a huge fan

25
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.300
of yours from the internet.
People can check you out

26
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.720
at Cassa. Do C a
S S I D O

27
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.110
O. Do you make tick
talks, but you do them

28
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.920
for the Twitter. These are
hilarious. They're killing. Oh, thank

29
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.650
you. This is where I'm
going to switch away from

30
00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.130
the NPR voice. It's it's
definitely something where I just

31
00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.250
wanted to find a video
editor that did like quick

32
00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.980
takes. And then I discovered
tick talks, video editor was

33
00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:06.500
good. And then I posted
this video last year, July

34
00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.650
or something. And then it
got a lot more popular

35
00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:11.780
than I expected. I was
just like making fun of

36
00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.430
the 10 X engineer thing.
And then I was just

37
00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.290
like, Oh, people like that,
that's fun. And I've if,

38
00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.730
if you were to really
deeply stalk me on the

39
00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.390
internet, I've been making videos
for a long time, but

40
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.190
none of them just got
popular. And a lot of

41
00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.260
them were just kind of
stupid. Like I would make

42
00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.870
music videos with my younger
cousins and stuff, which was

43
00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:38.060
a blast, but I kinda
just stopped making videos one

44
00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.230
day. Cause I was just
like, Oh, it's a pain

45
00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.810
to upload to YouTube, but
I don't want to deal

46
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.870
with going into the video
editor again and, and cutting

47
00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.230
all the frames together. And
then with talk, it's very

48
00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.620
easy to just make a
video and post it and

49
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.470
it's done. And so as
a result, I've kind of

50
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:58.940
returned back to my like
middle school, high school love

51
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.620
of playing with making videos
on the internet. Only. Now

52
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.320
they're a little bit more
specific cause it's tech stuff

53
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.800
and people seem to like
them Is tick-tock the new

54
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:13.740
vine different though. It feels
culturally different, but it's still

55
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.340
tweet sized videos. It's still
tweet sized videos. And it's

56
00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.330
interesting. Cause like when someone
makes a tech talk that

57
00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.640
is very Viney, like all
the comments will be just

58
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.380
like, Ooh, the vine energy
here. Like there, there is

59
00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.960
a specific different vibe when
it comes to vines versus

60
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:36.030
tic-tacs to define that. I
don't know how just, I

61
00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.180
guess the weirdness of it,
You know, someone out there

62
00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.000
is doing a PhD thesis
to do a machine learning

63
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.510
algorithm right now on how
am I the slider bar

64
00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.940
of vine to tick talk
and then they would you

65
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.130
upload a video and then
they get puts a slider

66
00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.590
bar and it goes, yes,
this it's 45% vine because,

67
00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.500
because of tempo or because
of quick cuts or because

68
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.610
of the length, and then
someone's doing that, Someone's bound

69
00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.400
to be. And I would
totally believe it. I would

70
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.820
support that. Absolutely do. When
you put stuff on the

71
00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.990
internet, how much do you
like overthink it? Like sometimes

72
00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:12.750
I get analysis paralysis, you
know how, when someone texts

73
00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.270
you and it's like.dot, dot
they're typing, they're typing and

74
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:20.490
then they stop. Did you
just like what's happening? How

75
00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:21.810
much do you think about
it and how much do

76
00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.330
you just like, like, I
don't swear on this, on

77
00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.160
this show. So we'll say
how much do you shoot

78
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.500
post on Twitter without actually
thinking about it? It's kinda,

79
00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.710
it kind of varies. I
would say probably the more

80
00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.570
successful my video is in
terms of metrics like likes

81
00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.020
and all that crap, the
more successful it is, the

82
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.870
least I thought the less
I thought about it. I,

83
00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.200
I truly, sometimes it's just
like, Oh, this song would

84
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.510
be good. I'll just make
one really fast. And then

85
00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.700
sometimes it's an idea I
noodle on for a very

86
00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.640
long time. And then it,
it's just kind of people

87
00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.790
like, ah, good job Cassidy.
So, I mean, I don't,

88
00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.950
I don't necessarily do it
for other people at all.

89
00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:03.840
I kind of just do
it because I like telling

90
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.570
jokes and I know that
at least a few people

91
00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.390
will get a kick out
of it. And then the

92
00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.570
rest follows and it's kind
of fun. Isn't that important

93
00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.210
though? Like we, they always
say like dance, like no

94
00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.250
one is watching. Like you
should tweet, like no one

95
00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:24.360
is listening. Yeah. I mean
with, with certain, with certain

96
00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:27.960
cultural rules in place, I'm
sure Indeed, indeed. What, which

97
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.730
was actually kind of makes
me think about this. Like

98
00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.570
a, you're a person of
a certain generation you are

99
00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.230
with no with no disrespect,
not the youngest tick talker.

100
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.790
It is very true. There
was one time here's something

101
00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:43.890
painful for you. There was
one time where I saw

102
00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:47.100
a tick tock and it
said, Hey, if you were

103
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:53.610
born before 2004, keep scrolling.
Oh it, it hurt my

104
00:05:53.670 --> 00:06:00.970
heart. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. Keep
okay. It was just like,

105
00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:03.250
don't, don't bother watching my
video if you were born

106
00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:11.140
before 2004. Yeah. So anyway,
that made me reflect deeply

107
00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:14.290
and I just kind of
closed the app and Well,

108
00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:16.450
yeah. And then, but then
you, yeah, I guess, but

109
00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:18.760
you still put the content
out there. Like, do you

110
00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.010
think that things have changed
because I put content out

111
00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:23.620
on the internet 20 years
ago and you know, on,

112
00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:29.650
on CompuServe and gosh, prodigy
and FIDOnet like BB without,

113
00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:33.640
without fear. But now that
everyone's on the internet, I

114
00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.610
wonder like you've got some,
some, some tech talks and

115
00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:39.160
some videos here with like
40,000 likes. I don't even

116
00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.440
know what that feels like.
Like I have a Beyonce

117
00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:46.030
tweet that I pinned that
I think deserves, you know,

118
00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.210
like an award and it's,
it's really good. It's my

119
00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:51.820
best tweet ever. Right. I
didn't even not even do

120
00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:53.800
it. My kid did it.
My kid, my seven year

121
00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.560
old legitimately asked me if
Beyonce was Marvel or DC.

122
00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:59.260
That's so funny. And I
think that that's like, that

123
00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.660
should be like a half
million, like tweet. It's got

124
00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:04.900
like 7,000. You've got your
wind non-tech people ask me

125
00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:07.420
to describe my job as
only 40,000. Should your phone

126
00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:09.370
just melt at that point?
And then is there any

127
00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:12.280
negativity that comes from that
that makes you not want

128
00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.560
to like do videos again?
The, I mean, there's, there's

129
00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.470
plenty of negativity whenever, you
know, a female is on

130
00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:23.470
the internet doing something, but
yeah, like I really enjoy

131
00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:27.070
making them. And a lot
of times it's me making

132
00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:30.280
a joke that is kind
of as niche as possible.

133
00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.990
And I'm just like, I
wonder how many people will

134
00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:34.930
get this joke. Like there
was one, there was one

135
00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:37.300
video that I did that
was not as popular, but

136
00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:40.180
I thought it was the
most hilarious thing where I

137
00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:44.350
was describing use effect and
react. And I lip sync

138
00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:49.150
some lyrics from the musical
Dreamgirls and the main character

139
00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:51.190
in dream girls. Her name
is Effie. And I was

140
00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:54.430
just like, it's not use
effect. It's use Effie. And

141
00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:56.500
there were so many layers
to that joke that I

142
00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:00.370
thought was stupendous. And, and
yet it was probably a

143
00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:05.020
little too specific in both
the worlds of musicals and

144
00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:09.130
tech and not even just
text, specifically react web development

145
00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:13.270
that, you know, it happens.
But there are definitely videos

146
00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:16.300
that I've made. Where for
example, I did one where

147
00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:20.350
it was just about dudes
interrupting me in meetings and

148
00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:23.560
the DMS and the replies
I got of being a

149
00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:28.960
man hater and just being
an SJW, et cetera, et

150
00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:32.830
cetera. There's those are annoying.
Those are, those won't stop

151
00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:37.300
me from posting, but they're
definitely annoying. Yeah. I want

152
00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:39.890
to be able to just
say funny things and not,

153
00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:42.670
but you know, you don't,
you don't always hit it

154
00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:44.650
though, right? Like, I mean,
you, you miss all the

155
00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:46.810
shots you don't take, but
you don't necessarily hit every

156
00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:48.610
joke. Right. Some of them,
they just don't land and

157
00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:51.100
you don't know why, like
why isn't this hilarious. Yeah.

158
00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:53.560
Yeah. There are definitely some
jokes that I have said

159
00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:56.160
in the past, because not
to toot my own horn,

160
00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:01.350
I've always been funny, but
I used to make, I

161
00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:04.650
still make jokes kind of
constantly. And whether people like

162
00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:07.260
them or not, I think
they're funny, but I used

163
00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.060
to make them a bunch
in the past and because

164
00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:11.280
I just didn't have a
following of some kind. They

165
00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:14.250
just, they got a few
like <inaudible> and that was

166
00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:19.230
it. And I was content
with that. And, and now

167
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:21.090
I kind of think back
sometimes I'm just like, man,

168
00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:23.310
if I tweeted that joke
today, it would be a

169
00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:28.320
smash hit. What, what is
this? And, and timing. Timing.

170
00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:32.370
Yeah. I've, I've talked to
some people about this recently

171
00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:34.530
because I'm not one that
tries to go for the

172
00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:37.650
followers. Like I just like
sure. They're, they're nice. They're,

173
00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:41.190
they're a cherry on top,
but I, it's not something

174
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:45.270
that I like try to
aim for. And they're also

175
00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:48.150
kind of new to me
too. Like I, when I

176
00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:52.860
did start making videos, the
follower account on Twitter, it

177
00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:56.490
jumped like 40,000 in less
than two weeks. And then

178
00:09:56.670 --> 00:10:00.450
it just kept accelerating from
there. And it was something

179
00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:02.520
that I did not expect.
And suddenly I was like,

180
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:06.510
Ooh, I, not that I
ever said anything particularly bad.

181
00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:09.330
I was just like, I
have to be aware of

182
00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:11.730
how I word things, because
there are a lot of

183
00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:16.230
people now who might see
it. And again, it's not

184
00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:18.540
like I was saying anything
particularly controversial at all. It

185
00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:21.270
was just like, ah, I
probably should cut back on

186
00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:25.670
the poop jokes, You know?
So I'm also like a

187
00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:29.990
highly, somewhat, highly placed Microsoft
person. Now. Like I have

188
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:31.880
like a job with a
title and like, you know,

189
00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:34.970
you have principal in front
of your job. And I

190
00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:37.760
got an email once from
someone internally that was like,

191
00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:41.330
why do you keep naming
your variables poo? Cause there's

192
00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:45.080
like VAR pu equals. And
they're like, it's unprofessional. And

193
00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:47.780
like, yeah, but it's never
not funny though. And then

194
00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:51.410
it's like, poop is always
funny and no one appreciates

195
00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:54.230
that. So it's like, well,
at what point will I

196
00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:56.840
just become like old person
who uses poo for their

197
00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:00.170
variable names, it's better than
foo and bar. Yeah. I'd

198
00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:07.520
rather do poo and sorry.
Wouldn't bar. So one thing

199
00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:10.640
that some of my cousins
and I've been doing in

200
00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:13.970
the quarantine is we got
this app for our phones

201
00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:17.870
called poop map. And all
it is is just whenever

202
00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:20.420
you poop, you log it
and it places a little

203
00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:22.880
pin on the map. And
then you can, you can

204
00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:26.150
like rate your poop and
add a little comment description.

205
00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:29.960
It's so stupid. And honestly
the app is very crappy

206
00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:33.980
pun intended, but it's so
fun because it's a little

207
00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:36.140
way that just my cousins
and I can kind of

208
00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:38.570
stay in touch. Cause we're
just like, Oh, you had

209
00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:43.730
broccoli. Cool. It's, it's so
stupid. But it's, it's hilarious.

210
00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:48.350
It's poop. Yeah. It's great.
It's so funny. And I

211
00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:52.820
love that it exists because
it's so dumb and it's

212
00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:54.910
just, and then other people
can Like your poo and

213
00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:57.730
then they get, there's like
a, there's like an actual,

214
00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:01.980
Oh my goodness. There is
a Legs of a leaderboard.

215
00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:05.910
Yeah. There's a leaderboard. And,
and I'm proud to say

216
00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:11.220
I'm number one. But we,
we, depending on your frequency

217
00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:13.080
of poops and stuff, it'll,
it'll rank you and you

218
00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:16.680
can join different leagues of
pooping. It's again, it's so

219
00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:19.920
stupid and it's, it's not
the best built app in

220
00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:22.650
the world, but it's hilarious.
And it's a way of

221
00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:25.950
bonding in corn As people
who have made it 11

222
00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:29.010
minutes into this podcast are
wondering what this is and

223
00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:33.270
why we're talking about it.
There's the enjoyment that one

224
00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:37.320
gets from the internet. The
sense of belonging, the sense

225
00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:42.510
of sense of connection. Like
you, someone might be listening

226
00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:44.670
from another country, another culture,
or you just might be

227
00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:46.980
a square and not funny.
And you may not think

228
00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:49.290
poop map is hilarious. And
I think it is hilarious

229
00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:50.760
and I've already downloaded and
sent it to my entire

230
00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:54.060
family. Nice. But I have
found a cultural difference. And

231
00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:56.760
I'm not saying this culturally,
like from a language or

232
00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:00.840
country of origin perspective, but
my nontechnical wife, she's a

233
00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:05.100
nurse does not feel that
my online relationships are as

234
00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:08.370
real as I do. And
she'll say, Oh, you talked

235
00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:09.720
to your cousin Jack. And
I'm like, Oh yeah. I

236
00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:13.020
talked to him like, like
all week and then she'll

237
00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:14.340
dig into it. And it
turns out like I've been

238
00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:18.060
liking his stuff on Facebook
and I'm like, well, yeah,

239
00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:19.710
like I feel close to
him. He says a thing.

240
00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:24.000
And I'm like, cause it's
the linguistic. Back-channel like, it's

241
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.500
the, it's the internet remote
equivalent of going. Hmm. Yeah.

242
00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:32.790
Yeah. It's ACC it's act
B. I couldn't explain act

243
00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:36.070
though. You know? It's like,
yes. That's perfect. Exactly. Exactly.

244
00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:40.380
Yeah. But do you, do
you ever have anyone question

245
00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:43.290
your internet friendships and how
you interact with people remotely?

246
00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:48.900
I've definitely had to explain
them to my parents. Cause

247
00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:50.460
they're just like, why are
you talking? What do you

248
00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:52.530
mean? You're talking to a
stranger on the internet. You've

249
00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:54.930
never met. I'm just like,
Oh no, they've been my

250
00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:59.430
internet friend for like eight
years. We met on turntable.fm

251
00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:03.810
chatting over. Mash-ups like, like
they, they don't understand the

252
00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:08.760
concept that I have a
random friend who I've met

253
00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:13.140
over discord and he's based
in Hungary. And we sometimes

254
00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:17.220
mail each other snacks. Like
that's, it's a, it's a

255
00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:21.630
very different worlds for people
who don't understand how powerful

256
00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:24.630
an intranet friendship can be.
And it is it's, it's

257
00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:28.050
really great. Some people that
I'm friends with on the

258
00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:31.800
internet, through discord, through video
games, through whatever are people

259
00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:36.480
who I'm closer with than
some of my neighbors, even

260
00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:41.070
just because we talk so
regularly, just sometimes in detail,

261
00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:42.840
sometimes it's just like, Hey,
hope your day is going

262
00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.790
well, see ya. And that
that's the extent of our

263
00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:49.080
conversation for a week. See?
Exactly. And there's, there are

264
00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:53.090
people. I was, I was
actually on my animal crossing

265
00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:55.970
Island. It's very important construction
work. I've been working on

266
00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:59.000
lately. And I talked with
someone that I had hung

267
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.550
out with at a convention
like 11 years ago. No,

268
00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:04.910
I'm not saying I manage
every relationship that successfully, but

269
00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:07.970
you meet when you meet
someone. Cool. And you're like,

270
00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:10.160
you're in a, like when
you were a kid, you

271
00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.010
would be like, will you
be my friend? But now

272
00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:15.050
we're adults. So we can't
say that. Cause that's weird.

273
00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.930
But you know that that's
like, we will be friends,

274
00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:21.140
which aren't, which you also
can't say. Yeah, there are,

275
00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:23.470
there are some people where
after talking with them, I'm

276
00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:25.720
just like that as a
personal be friends with like

277
00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:28.690
one of my closest friends
now, which I'm excited. Cause

278
00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:30.580
she lives in Seattle now
where I am. And so

279
00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:33.280
we get to interact a
little bit more, but I

280
00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:36.760
remember within a few sentences
of meeting her, I was

281
00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:39.580
just like, okay, we vibe,
this is great. She's going

282
00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:42.670
to be friends for like
five years now. I met

283
00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:44.470
this person like 11 years
ago. And then like, I

284
00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:46.330
was there hanging out my
Island and my wife's like,

285
00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:47.950
what are you doing? I'm
like, Oh yeah. You know,

286
00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:50.350
Danielle from such and such
conferences on my Island. We're

287
00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:53.530
like digging for fossils. She's
like, that is the weirdest,

288
00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:56.320
weirdest thing ever. Like we
have, we share pictures and

289
00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:58.450
she sends me pictures of
her kids sometimes. Like, it's

290
00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:01.600
like, cool. When did you
see her last? Oh yeah.

291
00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:05.350
Like the early aughts of
the century. Like, I don't

292
00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:08.080
know. Like I want people
to be happy and successful

293
00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:10.000
and I want them to
be healthy and I want

294
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.560
to like pictures of their
families. Yeah. Yeah. It's and

295
00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:17.710
it's, it's a weird time
with social media right now.

296
00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:21.010
Like I personally don't really
post much on Facebook anymore.

297
00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:23.470
Mostly because a lot of
people I know have left

298
00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:29.080
Facebook, but it's still finding,
finding those little nooks and

299
00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:31.840
crannies in the internet where
you can just interact with

300
00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:34.750
people that are fun is
it's great. And I kind

301
00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:37.750
of miss the, I guess,
good old days of, of

302
00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:41.800
something like early Facebook, early
Instagram, early Twitter and stuff

303
00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:43.720
where it felt like it
was just kind of this

304
00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:46.330
like tight knit little club
where you're talking with the

305
00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:49.360
people who are your friends
and new friends and you

306
00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:51.130
just add people all the
time and you talk with

307
00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:53.590
them all the time. And
now it's, it's feels like

308
00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:56.650
a different vibe. Now people
aren't posting as much as

309
00:16:56.650 --> 00:17:00.130
they used to unless they
are just like shooting the

310
00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:02.680
breeze or they're trying to
be an influencer or something.

311
00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:07.090
And you, you kind of
have to, it, it has

312
00:17:07.090 --> 00:17:11.770
led to my mostly interacting
with people one-on-one or in

313
00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:15.400
smaller group chats or, or
like discord servers that are

314
00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:18.340
smaller and stuff. And that's,
that's how I've been kind

315
00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:21.790
of getting internet social Yaz
out through, through those kinds

316
00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:25.420
of mediums. When you need
to focus on building, do

317
00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:27.910
you want to get bogged
down by your database? Mongo

318
00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:30.940
DB is an intuitive, flexible
document database that lets you

319
00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:34.540
get to building Mongo. DBS
document model is a natural

320
00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:36.610
way to represent data so
you can focus on what

321
00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:40.030
matters. Mongo DB Atlas is
the best way to use

322
00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:43.450
Mongo DB. It's a global
cloud database service that gives

323
00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:46.510
you all of the developer
productivity of Mongo DB. Plus

324
00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:50.370
the added simplicity of a
fully managed database. You can

325
00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:57.930
get started free with Mongo
DB atlas@mongodb.com slash Atlas. I've

326
00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:02.160
noticed that my, my 12
year old plays Fortnite a

327
00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:04.260
lot and I thought to
myself, man, this kid plays

328
00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:06.900
too much Fortnite. And then
I started watching and listening

329
00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:08.730
and paying attention. Since we're
all in this kind of

330
00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:11.430
weird quarantine place right now,
I don't think he's actually

331
00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:14.850
playing Fortnite. I think he
has like a daily standup

332
00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:18.420
with his friends. And then
there's also like unicorns and

333
00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:20.370
rocket ships and things running
around. Like it's, it's a

334
00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:23.130
conference call with a bunch
of kids while they're all

335
00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:28.490
screaming resume. Yeah. That's very
accurate. Like I play Fortnite

336
00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:31.550
a lot of with friends,
but also sometimes with like

337
00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:36.320
coworkers, children, but I, I
really enjoy playing it. And

338
00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:41.900
it's interesting to play with
people my age, where we

339
00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:43.850
are actually trying to, when
we're actually trying to play

340
00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:46.490
where we're actively playing. And
then when I play with

341
00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:50.360
kids, it's a very different
game for them because they're

342
00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:52.730
just, they're having a good
time. They're like shooting each

343
00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:54.980
other and dancing in front
of each other. They don't

344
00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:57.020
care that enemies are coming.
They're just like, okay, let's

345
00:18:57.020 --> 00:19:00.200
play the next one. And
it's, it's a very chaotic

346
00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:04.910
way to play, but it's,
it's fascinating because you're right.

347
00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:08.210
It's, it's like a, a
friendship standup. It's a, it's

348
00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:11.090
a hangout. But Fortnite happens
to be in front of

349
00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:15.020
them. Here's something that is
gonna make you smile ear

350
00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:17.840
to ear. You ready for
this? I'm ready. So I

351
00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:21.050
don't usually multitask when I'm
recording a podcast, but poop

352
00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:25.400
map was too amazing to
not share. So I pinned

353
00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:27.830
it. It's the only app
on my first screen. Now

354
00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:31.010
I screenshotted it. I tweeted,
this is why I talked

355
00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:33.970
to Kasey for Cassidy, for
the difficult, you know, for

356
00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:37.850
the app recommendations in difficult
times, this was four minutes

357
00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:44.090
ago, three minutes later, the
dev for poop map in

358
00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:46.850
Croatia just sent me. This
is amazing. This is my

359
00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:50.540
app. I love you, Scott,
that hurdle coincidence. I didn't

360
00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:53.390
even say poop, man. He
didn't like ego search for

361
00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:56.150
it. He just happened to
be up at 10 o'clock

362
00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:58.400
at night and crochet saw
the tweet and is losing

363
00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:02.150
his mind. That is so
fun. Oh my gosh. I

364
00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:04.790
want to meet the man
if I can't shake his

365
00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:08.450
hand. Both quarantine Andy's yeah.
Nino has has you're on

366
00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:14.060
the thread now and he
is flipping out, Like kept

367
00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:15.770
my family going through it.
Yeah. I have to tell

368
00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:17.480
him that because it should
need, it needs to go

369
00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:20.780
in the, I don't know
the about box something that

370
00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:23.630
is awesome. So this is
the thing, right? Whatever it

371
00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:26.810
takes to, to hang out
with people to feel connection.

372
00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:30.710
Right. As someone said something
interesting about the, the pandemic,

373
00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:33.260
like, do you think if
it had happened five years

374
00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:35.810
ago or even last year
that the internet would have

375
00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:39.410
been ready for us to
try to have an emotional

376
00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:43.880
and a human connection with
people? You know what I

377
00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:46.130
mean? Like, did we have
the tools? Would we like,

378
00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:47.890
if this would be a
bit on, like where would

379
00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:52.810
we have gone to feel
connected to people? Yeah. I

380
00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:55.870
don't know. Like, so as
much as I dislike social

381
00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:57.610
media and I wonder what
the next Twitter is and

382
00:20:57.610 --> 00:21:01.030
what the next Facebook is,
because I remember what they

383
00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:04.930
were before. I don't know
if this is the, like

384
00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:07.300
if we met every, reached
the pinnacle of how to

385
00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:12.090
stay in contact with people,
One thing that I kind

386
00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:14.370
of miss and they're kind
of coming back in a

387
00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:17.700
way. And so I'm observing
from a distance, but I

388
00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:21.780
kind of missed just forums
from the early days. Like

389
00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:24.960
before, before Facebook came out
and stuff, I made this

390
00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:28.320
forum with my friends. I
just like used a template

391
00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:33.210
and just pretty much everybody
in my middle school class,

392
00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:36.510
we would hang out on
this forum and chat and

393
00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:39.900
sometimes the threads were dumb,
but we would spend hours

394
00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:43.440
just jumping between conversations, talking
about different things that we

395
00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:46.440
didn't even have chat rooms
or anything. Cause that wasn't

396
00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:49.740
as much of a thing
on websites at that point.

397
00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:53.040
And, and it was great
and it was, it was

398
00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:55.710
such a good way to
keep conversations going. And, and

399
00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:58.710
I've kind of tried to
duplicate that again with discord

400
00:21:58.710 --> 00:22:02.880
sometimes with friendship, Slack groups
and stuff, and you see

401
00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:05.940
forums popping up, there's some
great mechanical keyboards ones, for

402
00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:10.080
example, that I'm in LA
called Geekhack and there's there's

403
00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:13.590
even like indie hackers and
stuff there there's there's forums

404
00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:18.600
out there for different interests.
And I, I kind of

405
00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:21.030
miss that vibe of the
internet again, where it's like

406
00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:25.590
relative anonymity, but you're still
talking with people who you

407
00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:28.740
can become friends. Right. It
was Reddit without people just

408
00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:32.580
being, taking their anonymity and
being Right. Yeah. It was

409
00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:37.710
pre mean internet. Yeah. You
know, that's, I want to

410
00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:40.110
get back to pre mean
internet. And I think that

411
00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:43.960
a highly curated Twitter feed
with a lot of muting

412
00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:46.590
and, and very aggressive blocking
can be that, but it's

413
00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:49.440
still not quite there. I
guess they just added a

414
00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:51.990
thing in Twitter. They're testing
it out where you can

415
00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:54.300
start a conversation with a
bunch of people and then

416
00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:57.870
just not have other people
jump in. Right. I saw

417
00:22:57.870 --> 00:23:00.210
that a friend of mine
did that recently where she

418
00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:03.510
said only mentioned people can
reply to the thread and

419
00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:06.720
it was interesting cause you
you're just an observer at

420
00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:09.660
that point. And, and I'll
be curious to see how

421
00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:12.030
that future takes off. Have
you, you know, one of

422
00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:17.040
the things that I love
is watching famous people that

423
00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:19.020
I, that I think I'm
friends with and I'm not

424
00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:21.690
really friends with them, like
set up meetings and stuff

425
00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:23.310
on Twitter, you know what
I mean? You see like,

426
00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:25.710
you know, this kind of
like B-level actor from that

427
00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:28.680
show and that kind of
like random, you know, person

428
00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:30.180
that you saw in that
thing and that episode of

429
00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:32.610
law and order, and they're
like, Oh yeah, we should

430
00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:34.020
hang out. I'm like, whatever.
I'm like, Oh my God,

431
00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:37.470
I'm watching my favorite people.
Like I like, I like

432
00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:41.070
watching shows and then I
don't friend or try not

433
00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:45.120
friend, I don't follow the
lead. I follow the thick,

434
00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:49.400
the, the, the, the friend,
right? Like the, the third

435
00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:52.370
person on the show because
they're working actor and they're

436
00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:54.590
like a real human. And
they really like, if you

437
00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:55.970
tell them, like I watch
a show and I'm like,

438
00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.510
Oh my goodness. You're awesome.
Yeah. No, it's great. It's

439
00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:03.850
so fun. I, I did
that. When was it? I

440
00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:07.090
said, did you watch parks
and rec? Oh yeah. Sean,

441
00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:12.580
I'm always tweaked retweeted me
once. I know, See, this

442
00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:15.340
is what I'm talking about.
It was very exciting. Yeah.

443
00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:17.680
And I was just like,
Oh my gosh, it's Shawna,

444
00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:19.900
but that's not her real
name, but that's so cool.

445
00:24:20.410 --> 00:24:21.760
Oh my goodness. See, that
kind of stuff is so

446
00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:27.670
cool. So true story. I
watched altered carbon. Did you

447
00:24:27.670 --> 00:24:30.250
see that? I haven't seen
that one. Oh, it's so

448
00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:36.070
good. So altered carbon. It's
like this amazing future universe

449
00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:37.780
where you basically back your
brain up on a USB

450
00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:42.220
key. And in the show,
there's a fella who plays

451
00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:46.570
the AI. Who's like friends
with the main character and

452
00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:48.130
he's the heart and the
soul of the thing. And

453
00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:50.050
he's a stage actor and
he's got presence and he's

454
00:24:50.050 --> 00:24:53.350
just amazing. He, he just
chews up the stage. He

455
00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:57.790
just, he just is the
best gushing, gushing gushing. So

456
00:24:57.790 --> 00:24:59.890
I S I pause, you've
done this. You're watching a

457
00:24:59.890 --> 00:25:03.310
show. Oh my goodness, pause
the show. Go to <inaudible>.

458
00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:07.120
Who is that? Go on
Twitter, follow them. You're amazing.

459
00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:10.390
I hope you have success
in life. He lives in

460
00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:14.650
Portland. We went to Chipotle.
We like hung out. Like,

461
00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:17.500
this is my buddy. Now,
like, Chris is amazing. And

462
00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:20.650
we like did a podcast.
And like, I think the

463
00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:23.140
world of this fellow, and
now we like send Bitmoji

464
00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:27.550
to each other on message.
That's so fun. Internet. Like

465
00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:29.620
people are just trying to
make art and do a

466
00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:32.140
good job and have fun.
And if you're kind and

467
00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:35.440
non creepy to them, like
it will, things will work

468
00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:38.020
out. You know what I
mean? Yeah. Yeah. It's very

469
00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:43.240
true. How are you coping
during the remote, the remote

470
00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:45.070
work thing? You've been remote
working remote for a while

471
00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:48.850
now. Like, do you have
like Slack teams, Skype, zoom

472
00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:52.000
meetings? How do you keep
connected to people? Yeah, so,

473
00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:55.180
so I will say, you
know, remote work is not

474
00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:58.330
quarantine work, so it's still
weird, even though I've been

475
00:25:58.330 --> 00:26:02.350
remote working for awhile. And
I'm sure you agree. What,

476
00:26:02.530 --> 00:26:05.440
one thing that I've been
doing with, with friends and

477
00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:08.110
some family is, is we
do what we call stretch

478
00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:12.130
and share. And it's something
that I did at previous

479
00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:16.180
companies when I worked in
person where just every day

480
00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:19.480
at 2:00 PM or whatever, we
would go to a conference

481
00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:21.970
room and we'd stretch and
chair. And so we'd go

482
00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:23.890
around the circle. People would
say like what they're working

483
00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:26.470
on that day, or what's
up with them. And they

484
00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:28.300
would pick a stretch for
us all to do like

485
00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:31.510
stretch your arms or whatever.
And everyone would do the

486
00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:34.570
stretch while they share. And
I was talking with a

487
00:26:34.570 --> 00:26:36.040
friend of mine who used
to work with me at

488
00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:37.420
one of these companies. And
she was just like, we

489
00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:41.110
should bring that back. And
we did. And now every

490
00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:44.370
single week, day at three,
we do a stretch and

491
00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:47.640
share and we get on
a video call and, and

492
00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:51.300
we kind of invite people
as they want. And not

493
00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:53.730
everybody comes every day, but
it's a great, we'll do

494
00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:56.880
it. We'll do a stretch
and share. And we mostly

495
00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:59.130
are just like, well, today
was mostly the same because

496
00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:03.060
quarantine, but not a new
office chair, you know, that

497
00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:06.090
kind of stuff. And it's
been really great to stay

498
00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:09.450
in touch with friends who
I honestly wouldn't have stayed

499
00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:11.420
in touch with as much
if we weren't in quarantine.

500
00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:13.950
There are some people who,
some friends who live in

501
00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:16.770
San Francisco, who I genuinely
just don't talk to as

502
00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:18.840
often. And now I talk
to them almost every single

503
00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:22.050
day because we talk on
stretch and Sharon want that

504
00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:26.360
human interaction. Wow. See that
stuff is important, but it's

505
00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:29.450
also the, the, the lizard
brain knows that you're not

506
00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:31.310
really in a room with
other humans. And sometimes I

507
00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:34.280
get headaches after many hours
on video calls. So it's

508
00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:37.700
like, I feel simultaneously connected,
but also drained because I'm

509
00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:40.550
sitting here alone in my
room, talking to myself with

510
00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:45.020
25 of my closest friends.
Yeah. I actually, I taught

511
00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:47.660
a workshop yesterday and it
was very fun. I've taught

512
00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:51.410
workshops many times before, but
this one was particularly weird

513
00:27:51.410 --> 00:27:54.800
because nobody was sharing their
video or anything with me.

514
00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:57.080
Like, I would, I would
see like a little chat

515
00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:59.540
on the side, but besides
that, it was just me

516
00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:03.920
talking at my screen for
four hours straight. And it

517
00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:07.610
is weird. And it's exhausting
because you're not getting that

518
00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:10.730
eye contact. You're not getting
that kind of feedback that

519
00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:14.720
you normally get when talking
with humans. Hmm. Yeah. You

520
00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:17.390
need, there's a, there's not
just the, the linguistic back

521
00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:20.280
channel that we talked about,
the act there's the, the,

522
00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:24.980
the full body sense of,
of, of space that they

523
00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:28.880
occupy. There's the, the body
language, all of those things

524
00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:34.490
add up to being connected.
Hmm. Yeah. And it's, I,

525
00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:37.820
I like being connected to
people and, and things like

526
00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:40.700
this stretch insurance of it,
it's something that kind of

527
00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:45.410
helps get through the day
when, when quarantine is rough,

528
00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:48.770
it's, it's something that it's
something that is necessary, but

529
00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:52.010
I do really miss interacting
with people. And, and, and

530
00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:55.670
I'm, I am more of
an introvert, introverted person. So

531
00:28:55.670 --> 00:28:58.850
I do prefer, you know,
not being at large parties

532
00:28:58.850 --> 00:29:01.400
or anything, but man, I
could go for some hugs

533
00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:04.280
from friends. I haven't seen,
I think we could all

534
00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:07.550
do for a warm handshake
of something right now. Well,

535
00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:09.560
I want to play board
games. Like we've been playing

536
00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:12.230
tabletop simulator, but it's, it's
not the same as just

537
00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:18.080
like flipping the table for
real and, and, and just

538
00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:22.010
being there in person with
people. And so we, luckily

539
00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:24.500
because of where we are
with the internet, there's a

540
00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:28.520
lot of, there's a lot
of options for us. There's

541
00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:30.530
a lot of things that
keep popping up that do

542
00:29:30.530 --> 00:29:33.950
help you kind of stay
bonded with people, which is

543
00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:38.210
good, but hopefully it's quarantined
and soon it'll be really

544
00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:41.590
nice to be around. Yeah.
I really would like respect

545
00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:43.120
what my wife is saying
when she's like, you're not

546
00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:45.400
really connected to those people.
It is a combination. Like

547
00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:47.680
we connect to those that
we can, who either can't

548
00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:49.510
make it out or we
can't make it out like

549
00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:51.610
we are right now, but
it is nice to connect

550
00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:56.230
to humans. I appreciate the
way that you humanize technologist

551
00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:58.420
with your fun videos. I
know that they might just

552
00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:00.340
be silly things that you
put out there as a

553
00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:04.180
way of venting, but it's
one of those kind of,

554
00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:06.460
it's funny. Cause it's true.
You know what I mean?

555
00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:08.860
Like everything that you do
on your videos and on

556
00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:10.810
your, on your Twitter is
very much of like, Oh,

557
00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:13.300
that is such a thing.
We do that as tech

558
00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:17.940
people. Yeah. That's, that's kind
of why I do it.

559
00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:20.790
It's kind of a sub
tweet at myself on how

560
00:30:20.790 --> 00:30:23.160
to make those. Because a
lot of those situations, I'm

561
00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:26.190
just like, well, this happens
to me. And that means

562
00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:30.870
it probably happens to others.
And yeah, I I'm, I'm

563
00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:33.120
glad that you say so.
And I do appreciate all

564
00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:36.000
the people who do enjoy
them because it feels like

565
00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.850
we're bonding a little bit
out there in this internet

566
00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:42.270
driven world. Absolutely. Well, thank
you so much, Cassie Williams

00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:06.420
won't, You know, I could
have been like twitter.com/scott bye.

575
00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:08.190
Like I missed it by
like a month. It was

576
00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:10.020
ridiculous. And now that, that
guy won't give it to

577
00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:12.930
me. So now I'm Shan
Suleman, which means everyone calls

578
00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:17.520
me. Shane is like, Hey
Shane, like, no it's yeah,

579
00:31:17.690 --> 00:31:21.300
it's a thing. Cool. All
right. This has been another

of all official Hanselman's <inaudible>.
