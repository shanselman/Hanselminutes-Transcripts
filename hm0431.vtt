all weekly discussion with web
developer and technologists. Scott Hanselman.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.150
This is Lawrence Ryan announcing show
number four 34. In this

10
00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.410
episode, Scott talks with Jesse
stern shoes about applying improv

11
00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.170
to agile and lean startup
models. Hi, this is Scott

12
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.420
Hanselman. This is another episode
of Hansel minutes, and I'm

13
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.790
talking with Jesse staring shoes
from the improv effect@improveffect.com. How

14
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.350
are you? I'm doing great.
How are you? Lovely. And

15
00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.390
unlike all of my very
organized talks and podcasts, where

16
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.480
we have an agenda ahead
of time, this episode of

17
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.680
Hansel minutes is entirely improvised.
We have not prepared because

18
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:32.600
that's what you do all
day, as you do improv.

19
00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:38.120
Exactly perfect. Would an improv
person be talking on a

20
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.340
tech podcast and what is
it that you do around

21
00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.340
improv as it relates to
programs? Because you're, you're at

22
00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.620
conferences all the time. You're
at Ruby conferences and I

23
00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.170
met you at a technical
conference. Yes, that is true.

24
00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.150
I've made my way in
to find your people. How's

25
00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.260
it feel Spying on us
from other, what is your

26
00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.590
name? Don't tell that that
was the strategy. I just

27
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.470
wanted to be a spy,
a low tech spy in

28
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:09.590
a high tech environment. So
what is the improv effect

29
00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:15.590
to do? So we do
training for a lot of

30
00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:23.380
developers or UX designers, UX
experience people. And what would

31
00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.090
we do is we work
with them on either communicating

32
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.990
more effectively or thinking in
a more creative and innovative

33
00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.430
way. So I feel like
the skills that an improviser

34
00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.280
brings to the table and
the skills that a developer

35
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.030
brings to the table are
sort of creative minds, but

36
00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.940
have two different types. And
so the marriage of those

37
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.270
two minds come up with
something really interesting. And so

38
00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.540
that's why I've kind of
found my niche among the

39
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.130
developers and the techie world.
And is this getting people

40
00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.290
to think differently is about
changing one's perspective. It is

41
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.140
so that's part Of it.
So I usually like to

42
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.530
start with making sure that
everybody can communicate first. So

43
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.200
if nobody can talk to
each other and they're all

44
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.840
sort of doing their own
thing in their own silo,

45
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.140
then there's no reason to
be innovative and start solving

46
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.080
problems. If the whole problem
is they can't even communicate.

47
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.590
So a lot of times
that's where the issue lies

48
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.530
first. And then we move
on and start to think

49
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.100
about problems in a more
creative and playful way and

50
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.050
try to get them to
think there for Lee. But

51
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.630
while having fun, When I
think about improv personally, the

52
00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.520
first thing that comes to
mind is a thing here

53
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.920
in the U S called
comedy sports that people may

54
00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.320
have seen on shows like
whose line is it any

55
00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.510
way, which is a, a
pull up a way of

56
00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.020
exercising. The improv part of
the brain through, through play.

57
00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.200
Is that, is that what
you're trying to do? What

58
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.690
I say to people sometimes
when I walk into a

59
00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.290
room of developers and they
hear that I'm the improv

60
00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.300
person, they sort of freak
out and want to pitch

61
00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.210
themselves out of the building.
And so what I say

62
00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:01.980
to them is, you know,
what if we changed the

63
00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.950
word to improvise, you know,
how does that relate to

64
00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.660
what you do every day?
And all of a sudden,

65
00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.070
everybody in the room is
like, Oh, we do that

66
00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.690
all the time. So the
skills of an improviser, whether

67
00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.420
they're in comedy sports or
second city are the same

68
00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.290
skills that are useful for
any person in everyday life.

69
00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.090
So I'm not asking a
developer to put on a

70
00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.670
comedy show when I'm asking
them to do is sort

71
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:28.500
of fill their toolbox with
better ways of thinking about

72
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.070
things of problem, solving of
communicating with one another, which

73
00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.070
are all the things, you
know, that second city might

74
00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.330
be doing on stage For
folks who are listening and

75
00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.270
are not familiar with that
term. Second city, that's a

76
00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.210
very famous improv group that
created a lot of famous

77
00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.760
comedians that have ended up
on movies and shows like

78
00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.590
Saturday night live. It's almost
an incubator for comedians. Exactly.

79
00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:56.700
And so, you know, they,
they all practice the skills

80
00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.310
of being a good improviser,
which is what they do

81
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.990
when somebody throws them a
curve ball, when they're on

82
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.680
stage and making up something,
can they go with the

83
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.110
flow? Can they think about
it in multiple ways? Can

84
00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.070
they solve a problem without,
you know, any notice whatsoever?

85
00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.690
What they're very practiced at
is developing their team skills.

86
00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.480
So they know each other
really, really well. And they

87
00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:24.330
work together really, really well.
So no matter what's thrown

88
00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.670
at them the night of
a show, they can sort

89
00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.160
of handle it with ease.
And I think that those

90
00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.070
are the same kinds of
skills you should have on

91
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:36.030
any team. You know, it's
interesting that when I've done

92
00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.370
improv in the past, one
of the first things that

93
00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:41.160
people assume is that, Oh,
well, they're just a natural,

94
00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.080
right? I'm not a natural,
therefore I will never be

95
00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.690
good at improv. And this
person is clearly a natural.

96
00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.030
Therefore they're going to be
awesome, but this is a

97
00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.900
muscle that you have to
actually exercise. It is. And,

98
00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.810
and even, so for me,
I've been doing improv since

99
00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.650
I was 10 years old.
And I can, when I

100
00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:01.370
take a week off that
my muscle hasn't been worked

101
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.800
in the same way that
it should have. And so

102
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.920
it's just like, if you
play a sport, you know,

103
00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.320
and you're, you're doing a
sport and then you sort

104
00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.390
of stopped to go on
vacation and you come back

105
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:13.310
and you're, then you're sore
again. And you're sort of

106
00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.340
not as agile, it's the
same thing. It's the same

107
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:19.660
sort of thing that you
need to develop. So, And

108
00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:23.890
also the, the idea of
generosity when I was doing

109
00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:26.650
improv, I was reminded that
you all have to kind

110
00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:28.600
of go with it. You
don't want to make it

111
00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.640
all about you, especially when
you're in a team. Right?

112
00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:35.110
Exactly. So it's all about
the team. Oftentimes when people

113
00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:38.320
hear are improv, they think
standup comedy and that's very

114
00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:42.790
different. So improv is all
about teamwork and collaboration, which

115
00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:46.180
again, I think relates back
to, you know, teams of

116
00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.570
people at work that you're
all working together towards a

117
00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:52.960
goal and you can improvise
to get there. So a

118
00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.930
plan is great, but usually
it gets thrown out the

119
00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:57.910
window. It doesn't go the
way that you wanted it

120
00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:01.090
to. And so the more
you collaborate well with each

121
00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:04.390
other, the better you can
get. And if you, if

122
00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:07.120
you try to pull things
back your way to make

123
00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.550
it about you, or, but
I had a joke that

124
00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:12.040
I was working up to
and you've messed it up.

125
00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:16.420
Exactly. So that to me
is like, when somebody on

126
00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:18.640
your team, I compare that
to, you know, somebody on

127
00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.800
the team thinks they're clever.
They have this great way

128
00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:24.880
of solving a problem, or
they have the simple hack,

129
00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:27.130
but not everybody else is
on board. So it sort

130
00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:31.030
of throws the whole process
to a halt. And that's

131
00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:33.490
a, that's a sense of,
it's a kind of selfishness

132
00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:37.780
isn't it Is. And so
again, like the improviser's mindset

133
00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:41.200
is all about making your
partner look good. And, and

134
00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.270
so we say like, make
your partner look good and

135
00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:45.880
you look great, make your
partner look bad and you

136
00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:49.990
look worse. So it's, it's
all about setting up the

137
00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:52.180
other people for success, and
then it will come back

138
00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:56.230
towards you. So that speaks
to working in teams. I

139
00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:58.300
think about, about tech. One
of the things that my

140
00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:01.090
boss is really good at
is he doesn't make it

141
00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:03.190
all about him. He's always
trying to make it all

142
00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:06.220
about us. The 10 of
us that work for him.

143
00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:11.020
And he's, he's generous with
his, with who gets the

144
00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:13.930
credit. So in the context
of improv, like, it doesn't

145
00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:16.900
matter if the big laugh
and the payoff happened because

146
00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:19.930
your partner got that big
laugh. Cause in the end

147
00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:22.540
it makes all of you
look good. So, you know,

148
00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:24.550
if you're, you're getting up
there and you're pitching your

149
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:28.450
product to a bunch of
VCs and you know, there's

150
00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:32.200
a couple of you collaborating
on that pitch and somebody

151
00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:34.750
sort of forgets where they
are. You know, the worst

152
00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:36.490
thing you could do is
just like, wait for them

153
00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:39.640
to like figure it out.
It makes you all look

154
00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:41.890
bad at the end. So
I encourage people to like,

155
00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:44.380
you know, step up to
the plate. Like if you

156
00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:46.600
can sense that somebody's forgotten
where they need to be,

157
00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.880
then you take over and
give them a chance to

158
00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.280
breathe, like be a good
teammate. And in the end,

159
00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:54.220
you'll all look good for
it. One of the other

160
00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:56.790
muscles that seems to get
worked a lot is the

161
00:08:56.790 --> 00:09:01.680
idea of keeping the big
picture in your head. I

162
00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.710
there's this term in, in,
in comedy about calling, having

163
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:07.170
a call back. And this
is that feeling you get

164
00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:09.810
when a comedian, you know,
has some joke and then

165
00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:13.410
maybe 15, 20 minutes later,
they reference it. That joke

166
00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:16.770
from before. And then the
audience suddenly is on the

167
00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:19.800
inside. And the audience is
like, Oh, we were all

168
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:22.500
here 15 minutes ago. When
that, when he told that

169
00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:24.690
joke and then he just
referenced it, it was a

170
00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:28.530
call back. Those things happen
when the person who's giving

171
00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:31.800
the show is keeping the
big picture in is in

172
00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.350
their mind. And they see
an opportunity for a callback.

173
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:38.270
Exactly. Yeah. Or we call
that, you know, finding the

174
00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:41.720
game, what is the game
of this, of this scene?

175
00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:43.970
You know? And so why
don't you find that game,

176
00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:46.700
you know, your eyes on
the prize. So you know

177
00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:49.400
how to call it back.
And I think that relates

178
00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.830
to having that like end
goal, like I said, in

179
00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:55.730
mind or strategy in mind
and, you know, but not

180
00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:59.090
forcing it down other people's
throats. So, you know, it

181
00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:02.360
may be that that goal
needs to shift, you know,

182
00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:06.500
or that end goal needs
to go somewhere else, but

183
00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:10.160
sort of understanding how we
can get there and multiple

184
00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:14.790
ways as a team is
the best thing possible. Well,

185
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:16.700
when you're dealing with teams,
there's a lot of kind

186
00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:20.360
of relationship dynamics. There's people
who are trying to push

187
00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:23.300
a sense of power or
control. Other people are more

188
00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:26.450
likely to, to let go.
How do you kind of

189
00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:29.330
affect and adjust those dynamics
to make sure that you

190
00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:31.670
move forward and, and, and
get what done, what needs

191
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:34.790
to get done? Well, I
think first, you know, you

192
00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:37.970
understand what the makeup of
your team is. You spend

193
00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:41.600
time getting to know each
other and understanding dynamics. The

194
00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:45.560
next thing is like, you
know, an improv, we work

195
00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:48.290
that muscle of being in
the moment and staying present.

196
00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:51.830
So we understand that every
moment needs something different and

197
00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:54.080
we don't just go and
attack a problem the same

198
00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:57.830
way every time we're creative
with what each moment needs,

199
00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:00.920
you know, and then it
might be that, you know,

200
00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:03.980
we're, we're taking the lead
or maybe we're the product

201
00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:07.160
owner, but, you know, sometimes
taking a lead is taking

202
00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.280
the back seat and letting
other people step forward. And

203
00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:12.770
you can only know that
by a reading the moment

204
00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:15.200
and be knowing what the
big play is, what is

205
00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:18.020
the big end result that
you're trying to get to?

206
00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:20.830
Yeah. That, that sense of
being in the moment and

207
00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:23.420
in the one sense, like
I am in this, this

208
00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:25.940
minute, this, this, this discussion,
but at the same time,

209
00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:29.390
where am I trying to
take us today, tomorrow, next

210
00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:31.790
week? What's our big value,
you know, what do we

211
00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:34.160
value as a company, as
a product or in the

212
00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:37.760
context of improv as a
skit? Yeah. I mean, I

213
00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:40.220
think a lot of times,
you know, we make assumptions

214
00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:42.860
sometimes based in the corporate
world, like based on people's

215
00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:46.010
titles or based on the
customer, the way the customer's

216
00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:49.130
acted before, you know, or
the stakeholders acted before. But,

217
00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:51.890
you know, they may have
had a really terrible morning

218
00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:54.100
and we think we're going
to go out then the

219
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:57.610
same way we always have.
But in, in truth, that

220
00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:00.040
moment needs you to either
step up and play like

221
00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:02.230
the higher dynamic, or maybe
it needs you to step

222
00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:04.210
down and let them feel
like they came up with

223
00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:07.600
all the ideas. You can't
just keep doing the same

224
00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.850
thing the same way every
time. So you have to

225
00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:14.230
be really able to actively
be aware of what every

226
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:17.960
moment needs. That sense of
self awareness. That's a muscle

227
00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:19.350
you have to work on.
I mean, I think that

228
00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:22.110
there, there are people to
just go through their life,

229
00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:25.560
their business life with a
complete cluelessness about how their

230
00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:29.460
actions affect others. And that's
part of what, you know,

231
00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:31.200
what we do at the
improv effect is we come

232
00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:35.880
in and use play, you
know, and use exercises and

233
00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:39.690
experiential learning for them to
have fun and be self

234
00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:42.990
aware, like become more self
aware and aware of others,

235
00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:46.230
but they're doing it in
a way that's nonthreatening. So

236
00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:49.170
workshop, if you're laughing while
you're figuring that out, that's

237
00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:51.900
a lot better than like
a very high risk threatening

238
00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:54.990
situation when they probably would
have been better for you

239
00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:57.660
to figure out how you
come across, you know, much

240
00:12:57.660 --> 00:12:59.970
earlier. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you
want to, you want to

241
00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:03.690
fail fast. Exactly. And you
want to, you want to

242
00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:07.230
learn from it again like
that self awareness is key.

243
00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:09.420
And I think it's a
lot better to find out

244
00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:12.660
who you are when everybody's
having a good time, rather

245
00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:15.210
than like be, you know,
sent over with the dunce

246
00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:18.180
cap in the corner, like
to be reprimanded for how

247
00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:22.890
you're acting. You know, Companies
should do more funds, structured

248
00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:25.770
activities like this. I feel
sometimes like companies just say,

249
00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:27.570
let's all rent a cabin
and have a bunch of

250
00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:31.650
alcohol. And they call that
team building. This is much

251
00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:34.890
more structured. It is. It
is. And you know, I

252
00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:37.590
have a lot of conversations
with clients. They're like, well,

253
00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:40.800
we're thinking of bowling or
you, you know, and I'm

254
00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:46.020
like, thanks. So what I
think, you know, what we

255
00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:49.770
do is, is effective to
learn all of these outcomes,

256
00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:51.870
whether you want to communicate
better, whether you want to

257
00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:54.180
work better as a team,
whether you want to understand

258
00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:56.670
your customer, you want to
think about your product different.

259
00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:58.710
And then a side benefit
is you're going to have

260
00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:00.540
fun and it's going to
be it's team building, but

261
00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:03.330
why not learn? There's no
reason why you can't like

262
00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:06.030
fun and learning need to
be in two separate categories,

263
00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:10.860
you know? Yeah. I think
the bowling versus you juxtaposition,

264
00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:13.440
that's a, that's a little
tough. How are we going

265
00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:16.020
to grow as a, as
a family, as a team

266
00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:20.820
in the bowling alley? Yeah.
So great. You know, if,

267
00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:22.830
if the outcome you want
is just like an outing

268
00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:24.990
to get away, then good
have fun, you know, but

269
00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:27.240
if you actually want to
learn something that you can

270
00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:30.600
utilize the next day and
get up and start weaving

271
00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:33.030
it into what you're doing
every day, then why not

272
00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:36.240
do something like this and
enjoy it at the same

273
00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:38.640
time, like, you know, laugh
to the point of tears,

274
00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:41.850
you know, while you're learning.
And I can't think of

275
00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:44.730
something better than that. You
know, When you, when you

276
00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:47.940
talk about relationship dynamics and
how your, how your, what

277
00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:50.730
your response is, how what
you do affect your team

278
00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:54.020
or affect your, your, your
client. I know that you've,

279
00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:57.470
you've talked about the idea
of understanding what your natural

280
00:14:57.530 --> 00:15:00.080
role is within the team.
And then of course it

281
00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:03.060
could be stretching outside your
role. What does that mean

282
00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:05.480
to find your natural role?
Does it mean like I'm

283
00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:07.520
the one that talks a
lot or I'm the one

284
00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:12.970
that's super quiet. Yeah. So
exactly. So like in what

285
00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:17.170
environments, like given X environment,
what do you act like

286
00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:19.840
in a typical way? Like,
are you, are you really

287
00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:21.910
good listener? Are you the
one who's just waiting for

288
00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:23.710
your chance to talk all
the time? Are you the

289
00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:27.230
one who's steamrolling everybody at
a conversation? Do you, do

290
00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:29.230
you not pipe up? You
know, when we have these

291
00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:32.260
big standup meetings, what are
you, what are you doing?

292
00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:36.640
And evaluate that, and then
play with how you could

293
00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:40.270
step up, you know, or
step down and kind of

294
00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:42.550
test out what it's like,
what kind of response do

295
00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:44.860
you get if you put
on a different hat, you

296
00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:46.780
know, But how do you
do that in an authentic

297
00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:49.360
way? I mean, I always
talk about authenticity cause I'm

298
00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:54.160
a community focused individual, but
whenever I'm complaining about this

299
00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.200
at work, I just kind
of like this isn't authentic.

300
00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:57.970
And I ended up using
that word kind of as

301
00:15:57.970 --> 00:16:00.670
a, as a cudgel, but
like, you know, I want

302
00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:02.860
to be, to be real.
I don't want to be

303
00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:04.570
fake. I don't want to,
but at the same time

304
00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:08.320
we are manipulating the situation.
A sales person wants to

305
00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:11.920
sell a marketing person, wants
to impress upon the public

306
00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:13.990
with their product. How do
you be real without being

307
00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:17.770
fake? Well, I think first
you practice and that's exactly

308
00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:20.890
why, you know, doing a
playful workshop to kind of

309
00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:25.090
in a very low stakes,
you know, way say like,

310
00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:28.030
Hmm, what kind of outcome
happens if I, if I

311
00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:30.310
act like this, what happens
if I act like that?

312
00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:32.710
Just kind of playing around
with it and practicing it

313
00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:35.620
to kind of find where
you're comfortable and like where

314
00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:38.020
you're pushed to your outer
limits so that when it's

315
00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:41.410
back to like the regular
run of the day, you

316
00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:44.140
know, you've kind of played
around with it and you

317
00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:47.530
can still find how to
be authentic within each of

318
00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:51.700
those situations. That really resonates
what you just said about

319
00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:55.000
in a low stakes way.
I think the listeners and

320
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.890
folks that are listening to
this podcast should think for

321
00:16:56.890 --> 00:17:00.400
a second about when do
you get to practice some

322
00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:03.880
of the skills that you
use at work, your communication

323
00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:07.840
skills, your speaking skills, your
understanding, power dynamics and how

324
00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:09.820
things work in a group.
You know, when was the

325
00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:11.710
last time you had you,
you went and met with

326
00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:13.870
the CEO of a company
you were trying to sell

327
00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:16.690
and then said, Oh, and
landing like that. Let me,

328
00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:18.460
let me try that again
and see how you react.

329
00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:20.800
That will be much, much
better. You're always in a

330
00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:24.370
high stakes environment. Right. And,
and the thing is like,

331
00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:28.600
you know, companies spend so
much money on like technical

332
00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:31.240
training and you know how
to get this in this

333
00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:35.200
new, you know, spending go
to whatever, you know, but

334
00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:38.560
yet if they can't communicate
what they're trying to solve

335
00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:41.350
to other people and they
can't talk to each other

336
00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:44.530
and they can't think differently,
then how can you even

337
00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:47.200
like utilize the technical training?
Do you know what I

338
00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:50.100
mean? Yeah. Well, I think
basically we worked so hard

339
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:52.230
to get the tech, right.
And then when it comes

340
00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:54.870
down to getting the presentation
or the, whether it be

341
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:56.670
something like what I do
talk at a, at a

342
00:17:56.670 --> 00:18:00.060
conference or a press release,
it's kind of just making

343
00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:01.620
it up. And you're like,
yeah, it kind of felt

344
00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:04.880
right. We'll see if it
works out. Okay. And well,

345
00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:07.280
and that's exactly how I've
ended up at all these

346
00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:11.180
places, you know, is because
I think people are starting

347
00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:14.000
to realize that like attention
should be paid to the

348
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.210
people part and the, like
the thinking differently and the

349
00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:22.700
creativity and that that's just
as important as the, the

350
00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:25.670
other process, you know, and
the other technical skills that

351
00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:29.150
most of the breakdowns happen.
Not because of technical reasons,

352
00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:33.410
but because people can't like
communicate with one another very

353
00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:36.620
well. Yeah. There's a lot
of talk in the tech

354
00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:40.760
space around presentation skills and
public speaking and whether or

355
00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:45.920
not a talk should be
educational or edutainment, which is

356
00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:49.160
what I call my personal
brand of, of work. Some

357
00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:51.740
people have watched my talks
and said, well, that was

358
00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:54.350
just silly. You know, that
was just a bunch of

359
00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:59.270
jokes. And there's been some
really powerful and intelligent people

360
00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:01.610
in the tech space who
have said that, you know,

361
00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:06.080
there's too much personality driven,
public speaking going on. It

362
00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:09.890
shouldn't be about the, the,
the, the person who's speaking

363
00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:12.650
the entertainer, you know, how
do you find that balance

364
00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:14.900
between like, I really want
to be a great, funny

365
00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:17.780
presenter. I really want to
convey the message. I don't

366
00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:19.370
want to be too dry,
but at the same time

367
00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:25.010
I am, I am selling
whatever I'm selling. So, I

368
00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:27.200
mean, whenever I work with
people, I'm putting together their

369
00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:31.130
presentations, I always start with
the, you know, the question

370
00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:34.220
of what do you want
the outcome to be? So

371
00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:38.090
when your audience leaves after
they've heard you speak, what

372
00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:41.210
do you want them to
say, do and feel, and

373
00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:44.900
then reverse engineer your talk
back to that and make

374
00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:47.360
sure that everything that you
put together and your talk

375
00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:50.540
aligns back to those three
things. If it doesn't, it's,

376
00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:53.030
it's fluff and it probably
doesn't have to be there.

377
00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:56.210
And on, I mean, obviously
if you have a longer

378
00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:58.100
talk that you can give,
you can fluff it up

379
00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:00.050
a little bit. Right. But
if you have, like, you

380
00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:02.120
can only give a seven
minute talk, then make sure

381
00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:04.490
it's just, you know, down
to the core and simplicity

382
00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:07.520
of making sure it addresses
those outcomes that you want

383
00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:10.310
for your audience. I think
we pay so much attention

384
00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:12.020
to what we're going to
say. And we forget that

385
00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:15.620
like, presenting is all about
our audience. It's not about

386
00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:20.720
us. It's about them, you
know? And so who is

387
00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:23.240
our audience? You know, what
effects do we want to

388
00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:26.000
have on them? And then
does this align. So if

389
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.120
you want to have the
effect of like teaching them,

390
00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:33.110
you know, some new programming
language, but you want it

391
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:36.110
to be fun and not
mundane, then you want them

392
00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:40.460
to leave laughing and learning.
Then having jokes is fine,

393
00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:44.000
you know, because it's evoking
an emotion that you intended

394
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.980
on having your audience feel,
right. It's the, it's the

395
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:51.130
being Intentional, actually having a
plan. You don't want to

396
00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:55.380
accidentally have them laughing at
you now. And if you

397
00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:58.320
do then, like, I mean,
sometimes that happens, right? We

398
00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:01.230
can't control how everything's going
to go down in the

399
00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:04.200
moment of giving the presentation.
I think that's why getting

400
00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:08.250
comfortable around improvising is important
because we can take that

401
00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:13.020
sort of mistake and make
it a new, like gem

402
00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:16.290
of our talk. Like it
could be that moment that

403
00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:19.980
makes us more endearing to
our audience, more relatable to

404
00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:23.100
our audience than ever before.
So I think, you know,

405
00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:25.350
getting caught up in like,
oops, they laughed where I

406
00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:27.480
didn't want them to and
looking at it and beating

407
00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:29.520
yourself up about it. When
in turn it could have

408
00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:31.860
been, you know, the thing
that sort of broke the

409
00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:35.700
barrier between us and them,
you know, It's so it's

410
00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:37.830
so frustrating for me as
a person who has to

411
00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:40.350
not only give presentations, but
also watch them to see

412
00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:45.270
people lose control of their
talks. And I just feel

413
00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:48.690
like, Oh gosh, that's not
what you intended at all.

414
00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:53.040
No. So, so I'm definitely
not saying throw caution to

415
00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:56.730
the wind and don't prepare.
Like, I, I think the

416
00:21:56.730 --> 00:21:59.490
best thing you can do
is prepare to the point

417
00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:02.880
of being able to improvise.
So that means preparing so

418
00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:05.910
well that no matter what
happens the day of, you

419
00:22:05.910 --> 00:22:08.790
know, the core of your
narrative and your message and

420
00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:11.640
you know, what outcomes you
want, that you can still

421
00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:14.160
get to the goal by
improvising. And that way you

422
00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:16.650
don't lose sight, but you
can't do that kind of

423
00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:21.960
thing easily if you're not
prepared. Yeah, exactly, absolutely prepared

424
00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:24.780
and be prepared for things
to fail and what you're

425
00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:27.030
going to do when those
things fail and failure might

426
00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:30.240
be some code didn't compile,
or it might be the

427
00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:33.540
audiences and who you thought
they would be. Exactly. Exactly.

428
00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:37.440
So again, like, can you
take that moment? That's not

429
00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:40.440
going the way that you
had prepared for and still

430
00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:43.560
remain the expert and get,
get to the end, you

431
00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:46.290
know, and still have the
same outcome that you wanted.

432
00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:49.110
What does that mean? Being
the expert. I know some

433
00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:51.390
people have said that again,
don't make it about you,

434
00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:54.330
but you, you and your
presentations and your workshops talk

435
00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:57.480
about what it means to
be the expert. Yeah. I

436
00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:00.300
mean, if you're asked to
talk, you're the expert on

437
00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:04.410
that subject, right? It's, it's
your material, it's your narrative.

438
00:23:04.410 --> 00:23:07.800
Like nobody else has that
narrative. So you have to

439
00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:10.140
own it. And to me
being the expert means like

440
00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:13.890
both what you're saying is
prepared and also that your

441
00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:18.450
voice and your body language
match your expertise and words.

442
00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:22.770
So oftentimes I'll see people
that are phenomenal at what

443
00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:25.740
they do. Like they're amazing
developers, but when they get

444
00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:28.710
up to present, I lose
all confidence in them because

445
00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:32.130
their body language and voice
are so distracting that I

446
00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:34.320
don't think of them as
the expert anymore. All I'm

447
00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:36.360
focusing on is that, you
know, they're fidgeting with the

448
00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:38.940
clicker the whole time, you
know, and staring at their

449
00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:42.120
feet. But is it too
much to ask that everyone

450
00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:44.340
be good at public speaking?
Are we, are we, are

451
00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:47.180
we setting an expectation that
someone can be an amazing

452
00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:50.290
developer and also an entertaining
person? Yeah, No, I think

453
00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:53.290
again, you practice it just
like anything else, like, let's

454
00:23:53.290 --> 00:23:55.270
say you want to be
a Ruby developer, you know,

455
00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:57.520
you might take some courses
and start learning and you

456
00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:00.460
start practicing and then eventually
like you work on a

457
00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:02.650
project and you get better
and better, it's the same

458
00:24:02.650 --> 00:24:05.320
thing. So, you know, if,
if your goal is that

459
00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:07.990
you want to be an
expert presenter, you know, go

460
00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:10.990
to a user group and,
and do it again, like

461
00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:13.630
low stakes, low risk, or
do a workshop, then do

462
00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:16.090
a user group, then, you
know, kind of build it

463
00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:19.990
up in small steps to
where, you know, then you're

464
00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:23.470
at the several thousand people
conference in front of people

465
00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:26.050
by yourself. You know, What
did, when I wonder why

466
00:24:26.050 --> 00:24:29.830
people look at, for lack
of a better word, soft

467
00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:34.930
skills like this as being
so, so magical, this idea

468
00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:37.330
that it's it's so it's
intimidating, you know, code. I

469
00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:41.950
understand, but you know, I
can't compile my, my talk

470
00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:43.510
that I'm about to give,
but it really is about

471
00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:46.390
intentionality. You, you practice it,
you sit down, you do

472
00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:51.520
it and you revise factor
and recompile After you engineer

473
00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:54.250
it. That's what I said,
like, look, see what, you

474
00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:56.680
know, what is that thing
you're trying to accomplish? What

475
00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:59.230
does that end product you're
trying to build? And then

476
00:24:59.230 --> 00:25:02.350
you reverse engineer it. I
mean, you build, you know,

477
00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:05.170
you deconstruct it and build
it back together. You know?

478
00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:07.630
I mean, Seems like if
people think about it that

479
00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:11.230
way, then it wouldn't one
argue that the average developer

480
00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:13.390
who has those skills already
should be an early awesome

481
00:25:13.390 --> 00:25:15.800
presenter, meaning, meaning if you
can break these things down

482
00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:18.580
and then, you know, do
it, I think that more

483
00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:20.980
people should do it. And
I think that more people

484
00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:25.480
should practice. I fit. I
feel like there's so few

485
00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:28.120
speakers, like if you look
at the speakers and sort

486
00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:30.970
of our world, and I
consider myself in your world

487
00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:34.810
in terms of speaking, like
I would say like the

488
00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:39.610
majority of the conferences during
the year, I've spoke with

489
00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:43.000
at least five of those
people, no matter where it

490
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.080
is, whether it's in Australia,
London here in the States,

491
00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:50.740
because there's just not enough
people like trying. And I

492
00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:53.680
think we should encourage people
to try and a practice

493
00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:56.470
and a low risk way.
And then eventually we'll get

494
00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:59.950
more people and we'll have
more experts out there and

495
00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:04.810
more people sharing their unique.
Yeah, absolutely. I think that,

496
00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:09.430
that there are in some
cases the same people and

497
00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:11.830
I'm guilty of this as
well, you know, it's like,

498
00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:14.470
Oh, there's that, there's that
guy again, you know, pretty

499
00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:18.230
much get him. And I
have to reinvent myself in

500
00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:20.290
those kinds of things. But
at the same time, I'd

501
00:26:20.290 --> 00:26:23.830
like to hear from people
who aren't giving, giving enough

502
00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:27.820
presentations, I'm sure that whatever
you, the listener are doing

503
00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:30.310
at work is super interesting.
You know, you probably solved

504
00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:33.910
an amazing problem last week.
Why aren't you giving that

505
00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:36.970
presentation on that problem that
you solved at your local

506
00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:40.510
user group? Yeah. And the
thing is like, if they

507
00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:43.290
could just believe in themselves
and realize that what they're

508
00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:46.380
doing is valuable and share
that we as a community

509
00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:48.660
could be so much better
for that, you know, to

510
00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:52.170
have a diverse group of
people that are up and

511
00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:56.730
sharing. Cause it is presenting
is sharing, you know, sharing

512
00:26:56.730 --> 00:27:00.350
experiences and sharing knowledge Said
that the thing that got

513
00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:03.230
me speaking was the feeling
that you get when you've

514
00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:06.350
got you've solved some problem.
I used to people can't

515
00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:07.970
see me cause we're on
a podcast here, but I

516
00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:09.560
would be writing something. And
then I would just kind

517
00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:13.280
of like throw my hands
in the air, like go.

518
00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:14.900
And I'm like, I'm at
a cubicle, of course. And

519
00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:17.210
I'm looking around like, no
one else is impressed with

520
00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:19.640
what's just occurred in my
computer. So then I grabbed

521
00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:22.160
my laptop and I just
go kind of running down

522
00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:24.260
the hallway. Cause I have
to share it with someone.

523
00:27:24.290 --> 00:27:26.090
And again, no one, no
one cares. I'm just a

524
00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:30.950
weirdo. You just keep running,
Dude, dude, did you see

525
00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:33.140
this? And then you got
to present it. You got

526
00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:34.970
to share it with somebody
because it's like, this is

527
00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:39.440
so cool. Right? Exactly. As
a community, the tech community

528
00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:42.530
should not have any trouble
finding people to talk about

529
00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:46.330
cool stuff We shouldn't. And
yet we do. Yeah. Yeah.

530
00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:49.820
And when you say a
diverse group of people, we're

531
00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:52.670
not just talking about gender
and color and culture, we're

532
00:27:52.670 --> 00:27:55.850
talking about diversity of thought,
different, different ways of thinking

533
00:27:55.850 --> 00:27:59.360
about problems. Yeah. Yes. That's
how we all become better.

534
00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:03.020
We are probably not getting
the whole picture about how

535
00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:05.840
problems can be solved because
someone is not giving a

536
00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:10.910
talk. I totally agree. My
buddy Damien Edwards and I

537
00:28:10.910 --> 00:28:14.780
call the developers that we
don't hear from dark matter

538
00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:18.110
developers because as the dark
matter, you know what makes

539
00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:20.180
up the large amount of
the universe, but we can't

540
00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:23.810
prove that it exists. That's
great. I think they're out

541
00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:26.150
there. I think, I think
they're out there too. If

542
00:28:26.150 --> 00:28:28.700
you listen real hard, you
can hear them. We spoke

543
00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:32.030
in Norway and you were
giving talks there. What did

544
00:28:32.030 --> 00:28:35.960
you speak on in Norway?
So I talked about, I

545
00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:41.210
did some interactive type of
workshops around the way that

546
00:28:41.210 --> 00:28:46.250
teams, agile teams interact and
helping them interact more effectively

547
00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:51.050
and, and solve problems in
a more playful Right now,

548
00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:54.680
when you do these kinds
of workshops and discussions, you're

549
00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:59.360
not just teaching immuno standard
comedy improv to developers, you're,

550
00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:03.340
you know, about lean and
lean startup and agile. You,

551
00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:05.600
you not only know the
buzzwords, but you live the

552
00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:10.700
buzzwords and then apply your,
your improv concepts to those,

553
00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:15.470
those worlds. Exactly. I mean,
I remember like seeing the,

554
00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:18.620
and the agile manifesto for
the first time and being

555
00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:21.860
like, this is, this is
improv, like with, you know,

556
00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:25.370
different lingo. This is exactly
what improvisors do. And then

557
00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:28.370
the lean startup thing took
it even further. You know?

558
00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:31.190
I mean, I did a
whole talk about how like

559
00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:35.600
breaking down the lean startup
model and comparing it to

560
00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:41.030
an improviser's comedy set and
how like each piece is

561
00:29:41.050 --> 00:29:45.720
just like the same thing
as the lean startup. Why

562
00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:48.930
do you think that people
take concepts like agile and

563
00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:53.010
lean and then consequently improv?
And they, they say, Oh,

564
00:29:53.010 --> 00:29:56.370
well, agile is just an
excuse to be sloppy, you

565
00:29:56.370 --> 00:29:59.790
know, an improv. Well, that's
just making stuff up. Yeah.

566
00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:02.730
So that's not true at
all. And that frustrates me

567
00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:07.560
to no end. Yeah. So
I think, I mean, to

568
00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:10.080
me like the core of
lean and the core of

569
00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:13.980
agile is, is the way
that we communicate and the

570
00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:16.350
pace at which we do
that and that, you know,

571
00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:18.900
that everyone's on the same
page all the time or

572
00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:21.240
that we're not coming up
with ideas based on what

573
00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:23.190
we think people will like,
but we're getting out of

574
00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:26.190
the building or actually listening
or having empathy and we're

575
00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:30.840
understanding what people's needs are.
And then we're developing something

576
00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:34.740
based on those needs, you
know, Right. Lean is about

577
00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:41.190
learn, measure, code, rinse, repeat,
but the trick is minimizing

578
00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:44.220
that time and not spending
a year to learn you

579
00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:47.310
spend learning the day. Right.
And that's the same, like

580
00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:50.730
as an improviser. So let's
say we're doing a comedy

581
00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:53.910
show. We asked the audience
like to tell us about

582
00:30:53.910 --> 00:30:56.670
something. So we hear what
their needs are. Then we

583
00:30:56.670 --> 00:31:01.200
instantly start building that product.
Right. And we start testing

584
00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:03.900
it out. And if the
audience claps and we keep

585
00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:07.170
going forward, that's our validation.
Right. So we know that

586
00:31:07.170 --> 00:31:09.240
this is working and we
should keep doing more of

587
00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:12.300
that. If the audience is
kind of like, you know,

588
00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:14.340
maybe we found the game
of the scene, but we

589
00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:17.010
need to kind of shift
and pivot to go in

590
00:31:17.010 --> 00:31:19.680
a different direction. And if
the audience isn't responding at

591
00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:22.380
all, then we've learned like
in real time, as fast

592
00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:25.260
as possible, not to do
that anymore and to move

593
00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:27.720
on, you know, and to
me, that's just like the

594
00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:31.230
lean startup. Yeah, exactly. I
mean, the product is, is

595
00:31:31.290 --> 00:31:34.620
a happy audience and a,
and a great piece of

596
00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:38.100
material that you might then
take from improv and expand.

597
00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:40.170
I'm sure that you've probably
had improv skits where you've

598
00:31:40.170 --> 00:31:42.120
said, you know, we should
do a short video on

599
00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:45.630
this or Yep, exactly. And
we all talk as a

600
00:31:45.630 --> 00:31:49.110
team afterwards and we say
like, what worked, what didn't,

601
00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:51.330
you know, we stand up,
we talk about like each

602
00:31:51.330 --> 00:31:54.570
part that worked and we
say what didn't work. And

603
00:31:54.570 --> 00:31:56.340
we say, okay, we don't
want to do that again.

604
00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:58.590
Cause that didn't work. So
like if we failed at

605
00:31:58.590 --> 00:32:00.690
something, what can we learn
from that? So we don't

606
00:32:00.690 --> 00:32:03.870
do that again. Right? Yeah.
I hope that people who

607
00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:07.440
are listening kind of get
a sense of the intentionality

608
00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:10.560
of this and the, the,
even though it's loose when

609
00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:13.770
you're watching it, there's a
formality and a structure to

610
00:32:13.770 --> 00:32:16.920
this that is similar to
the kind of structure you

611
00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:19.650
need to apply when you're
doing agile in your engineering

612
00:32:19.650 --> 00:32:23.880
environment. Yes. There is absolutely
a structure to everything that

613
00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:27.270
we do. So we know,
again, we know what that

614
00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:30.390
framework is and we know
what the end goal is.

615
00:32:30.390 --> 00:32:32.880
Right. But then we don't
know what's going to happen

616
00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:36.150
in between, but we have
the framework to keep us

617
00:32:36.150 --> 00:32:39.030
together. And part of the
framework is maybe the game

618
00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:41.480
and part of the framework
is us as a team,

619
00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:44.870
you know, and we have
all of those things to

620
00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:48.550
keep some sort of structure
So people can learn more

621
00:32:48.550 --> 00:32:51.220
about what you're doing and
the concepts that you are

622
00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:56.140
applying to engineering@improveffect.com. I'll put
a link in the show

623
00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:58.480
notes and they can also
go out and we'll put

624
00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:01.600
some videos of your presentations
and, and your, your things

625
00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:04.390
that you've done. That sounds
great. Thank you so much.

626
00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:07.000
Thank you, Jesse staring shoes
for talking to us about

627
00:33:07.090 --> 00:33:10.390
applying improv to the lean
startup and agile models. This

628
00:33:10.390 --> 00:33:13.270
has been another episode of
Hansel minutes and we'll see

629
00:33:13.270 --> 00:33:14.230
you again next week.
