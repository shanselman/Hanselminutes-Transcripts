Hey, this is Scott. On
the last episode, I mentioned

2
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.530
a unique and nonprofit tech
conference in Florida called code

3
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.860
on the beach coming up
here, August 8th through the 10th.

4
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.530
I was fortunate enough to
keynote last year. And I

5
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.870
can tell you from experience,
you should check it out,

6
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.620
but you better hurry registration
for coding the beaches almost

7
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:25.950
over, but you can visit
www.covidonthebeach.com to register today and

8
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.460

happen to miss it this

10
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.500
year, put a reminder on
your calendar for next year,

11
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.160
cause it is an annual
event. They'll be back summer

12
00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.400
2015. Here's a little tip
though. They're planning a similar

13
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.490
event on a cruise ship
to The Bahamas, February called code

14
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.270
on the sea. So check
out code on the beach.com

15
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.020
and code on the c.com
to learn more about both

16
00:00:52.050 --> 00:01:11.010
conferences from hanselminutes.com. It's Hansel
minutes, our weekly discussion with

17
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.620
web developer and technologist Scott
Hanselman. This is Lawrence Ryan announcing

18
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.380
show number four 31. In
this episode, Scott talks with

19
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:26.850
dr. Steven John Russell about the biotic
pancreas study. Hi, this is

20
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.640
Scott Hanselman. This is another
episode of Hanselminutes and we've

21
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.460
got dr. Stephen J. Russell on the
phone from bionic pancreas.org. You

22
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.800
have all been in the
news a lot lately. There's

23
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.680
been some really exciting stuff
going on around type one

24
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.530
diabetics and some of the
work that's happening. Can you

25
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.200
give us an overview about
what it means to have

26
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.300
a bionic pancreas? Well, our
goal with the bionic pancreas

27
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.700
is to do two things,
really one to get better

28
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.570
blood glucose control than people
can consistently get with the

29
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.080
current tools that we have
available by providing a, this

30
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.050
new tool called the bionic
pancreas. And at the same

31
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.380
time to really reduce the
amount of work it takes

32
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.510
to manage diabetes. So the
system is one that takes

33
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.470
full advantage of several technologies
that have been available separately

34
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.300
for a number of years,
continuous glucose monitoring, insulin pumps,

35
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.970
and combine those along with
a dosing algorithm that takes

36
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.840
the information from the continuous
glucose monitor and makes decisions

37
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.490
every five minutes about how
much insulin and or glucagon

38
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.870
to either lower or raise
the blood glucose respectively to

39
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.330
give. And because it's an
automated process that happens every

40
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.650
five minutes, it's able to
continue to make those decisions,

41
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.950
make many more decisions on
a daily basis than somebody

42
00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.210
could possibly do on their
own. And as a consequence

43
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.320
that achieves better blood glucose
control with less low blood

44
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.210
sugars. So I'm a diabetic
of course, on a type

45
00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.150
one diabetic. And I have
worn an insulin pump for

46
00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.810
the last 15 years, 24
hours a day for, for

47
00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.080
maybe listeners who aren't familiar
with this, and this is

48
00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.340
replaced what we call MDI
multiple daily injections. I used

49
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.400
to check my blood sugar
with a finger prick eight

50
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.160
to 10 times a day,
and then take three, four,

51
00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.750
five, six manual shots a
day and then switched over

52
00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.200
to a continuous glucose meter
that would tell me roughly

53
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.840
what my blood sugar is
every five minutes. And then

54
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.600
I have to make all
those decisions myself. I am

55
00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.800
always thinking about my, my,
my pump. I'm always thinking

56
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.330
about the past and how
much insulin is in me

57
00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.600
currently and all of those
kinds of things. They teach

58
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.810
us in diabetes, class and
diabetes training, you know, all

59
00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.990
of these kinds of algorithms,
but most diabetics that have

60
00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:00.180
been diabetic for many years,
like myself are going on

61
00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.620
gut, but you've really broken
this down into straight math,

62
00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.990
right? Well, I have it,
my collaborators, the engineering collaborators,

63
00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.080
you all. So, yes, as
a, as a group, I

64
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.130
guess we have. So my,
my engineering collaborators are at

65
00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:22.110
Damiano and for us Alkhateeb
and ed was an applied

66
00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:26.430
mathematician, was working on fluid
dynamics when his son got

67
00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.880
type one diabetes. And so
that initiated shift for him

68
00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:35.580
in emphasis and his graduate
student at the time was

69
00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.820
very talented, but not particularly
interested in the kind of

70
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.610
work that he was doing.
And so he was easily

71
00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.180
persuaded to shift over to
control theory. So they worked

72
00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:50.820
on using control theory using
some of Ed's insights from

73
00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.800
managing diabetes for his son
day to day, and came

74
00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.790
up with a general structure
for the control algorithm, which

75
00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:02.540
has been refined quite a
bit over the years, but

76
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.390
was the basis for the
initial studies that they did

77
00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:09.870
in animals. And then I
met them in 2006 and

78
00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.640
we brought it into the
human realm and we've been

79
00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:19.350
working together ever since. And
the system really has, has

80
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:25.530
acquired evermore sophistication as, as
we've gone on and discovered

81
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.460
problems that we needed to
fix and circumstances that needed

82
00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.000
new solutions. And, and now
I think we have a

83
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.950
tremendously robust system that requires
a bare minimum of information

84
00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:40.500
about the person with diabetes
to start with. And that

85
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.130
is just their weight. And
then it requires frequent blood

86
00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:48.810
glucose information from the continuous
glucose monitor. And it adapts

87
00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:52.500
over time to the insulin
needs of that individual and,

88
00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:58.560
and remarkably provides excellent blood
glucose control starting with, with

89
00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:01.250
those very minimal bits of
information that doesn't need any

90
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.910
information about the insulin regimen
that the person has been

91
00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:11.020
taking beforehand. Interesting. I, I,
I've heard some disturbing reports

92
00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.680
that a lot of diabetics
that use pumps fail to

93
00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.290
change their default settings. And
a lot of people are

94
00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:20.740
out there with basically pumps
that are shipped the way

95
00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:25.210
they shipped from the factory.
Yeah, that doesn't surprise me

96
00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:29.290
very much. I think that
one of the reasons we

97
00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:32.440
wanted to avoid using the
information about the insulin regimen

98
00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:35.470
was that it could just
be flat wrong as you

99
00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:39.250
point out. But another reason
is that even if the

100
00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:44.080
insulin regimen was fairly reasonable,
it's a moving target people.

101
00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:47.020
Aren't the same from day
to day. And certainly not

102
00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:49.480
from week to week or
month to month, you know,

103
00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:53.710
during development, when kids go
from the preadolescence to puberty

104
00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:57.310
their insulin requirements, rocket upwards,
and they get very much

105
00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:00.580
higher and then they drop
again, once they finished their

106
00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:05.080
growth spurt and go into
adulthood, people's insulin requirements changed

107
00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:08.590
tremendously based on how active
they are, how much exercise

108
00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:12.520
they're getting, what kind of
diet they have. And we

109
00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:16.180
really wanted a system that,
that could robustly adapt to

110
00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:20.110
those changes on a timescale
that would allow it to

111
00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:24.490
deal with realistic changes in
the insulin needs of somebody

112
00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:28.810
over time. And so the
system does that. It does

113
00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:31.960
most of its adaptation within
the first 18 hours when

114
00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:35.620
you put it on a
new person. And so it

115
00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:40.210
can then adjust if though
that person's insulin needs change,

116
00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:43.090
it can adjust on that
same kind of timescale. And

117
00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:46.810
we think that's fast enough
to deal with most physiologic

118
00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.960
changes that would happen over
somebody's lifetime. Well, then there's

119
00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:53.170
also changes day to day.
If someone has the flu

120
00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:56.800
or someone is starting to
develop slow digestion or stomach

121
00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:01.090
paralysis, maybe insulin is going
bad. If they've had it

122
00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:03.760
out in the heat, how
would it deal with situations

123
00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:08.380
like that? Well, you know,
it's, it's shortest timescale is

124
00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:12.160
of course the every five
minute timescale. So regardless of

125
00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:18.010
its it's adapted parameters, if
the blood glucose is dropping

126
00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:21.250
rapidly, it'll turn off the
insulin and it will give

127
00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:25.240
some glucagon. Likewise, if it's
rocketing upwards, it'll give more

128
00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.180
insulin how aggressive it is
at dosing. That insulin of

129
00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:33.730
course is affected by the
adaptive parameters that, that change

130
00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:39.280
over time. But even more
rapid changes are easily dealt

131
00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:43.090
with, with, by the control
algorithm. For instance, one of

132
00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:46.870
the big challenges with using
insulin is that it's absorbed

133
00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:49.720
fairly slowly and people who
don't have to use it,

134
00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:53.260
probably aren't aware of this,
but you give insulin and

135
00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.970
it's given underneath skin. It
has to be absorbed from

136
00:08:56.970 --> 00:09:01.080
that space into the bloodstream.
And the average time for

137
00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:04.140
that insulin to reach its
peak blood levels is about

138
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:07.080
70 minutes. And in some
people it can be much,

139
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:10.230
much longer than that. So
there's a, there's a long

140
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:13.620
wait to see the effect
of a particular insulin dose.

141
00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:17.160
And by the same token,
if insulin has already been

142
00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.730
given and circumstances change so
that you don't need as

143
00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:23.460
much insulin anymore, you're kind
of out of luck. You

144
00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:25.980
can't take it back. And
the only way to deal

145
00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:28.470
with that in the past
was to take carbohydrates. And

146
00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:31.500
of course you had to
sense that you were low

147
00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:34.500
or going low, which not
everybody can do after they've

148
00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:36.420
had diabetes for a while,
and you had to have

149
00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:41.430
carbohydrates available and a note
to take them. What's nice

150
00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:45.540
about the, the by hormonal
approach using glucagon is that

151
00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:49.020
it can automatically both turn
back the insulin, although that

152
00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:52.140
doesn't have as much immediate
effect as you would like,

153
00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:55.410
but it can also automatically
give these micro doses of

154
00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:59.850
glucagon, which work even faster
than taking oral carbohydrates and

155
00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:03.510
can really rescue you in
a situation like that. Where

156
00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:06.000
the insulin that was given
was right at the time

157
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.970
it was given, but then
circumstances changed and it wasn't

158
00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:12.270
right anymore. There's really no
other solution for that, but

159
00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:15.620
to take carbohydrates or use
glucagon. Yeah, I've always had

160
00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:19.670
this nightmare that I would
take insulin perhaps an hour

161
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:22.400
before lunch and then get
in the car and then

162
00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.860
get in a car accident
and then be lying there

163
00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:28.130
with 10 units of insulin
on board and have no

164
00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:31.130
way to tell the paramedics
that I'm headed for a

165
00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:33.200
much bigger problem than the
car accident that I just

166
00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:36.740
got into. Yeah, well, you
know, I, I have a

167
00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:41.630
con a collection of photographs
of people's type one tattoos.

168
00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:45.830
So it's actually surprisingly common
for people to get tattoos

169
00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:49.940
on their forearms or other
prominent, easily seen places so

170
00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:51.770
that if they get in
a situation like that, the

171
00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:58.190
paramedics will think of blood
glucose as a problem. It's

172
00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:01.150
sort of a, a morbid,
I guess thing. But I

173
00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:04.340
also look at it in
the same way that I

174
00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:07.190
looked at my grandfather's tattoo.
He came back from the

175
00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:09.350
Pacific theater in world war
II and had a Navy

176
00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:11.990
tattoo. And there was an
element of pride in that,

177
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:14.750
you know, that he'd been
there, he'd survived, he'd made

178
00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:19.610
it. And I think to
some degree, these diabetes tattoos

179
00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:22.100
are the same story, a
sense of a spree decor

180
00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:25.880
of people dealing with a
really difficult problem and some

181
00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:30.500
pride at successfully managing it
day to day. I definitely

182
00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:35.000
have had that sense going
into well over 22 years

183
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.350
now where I'm, I'm pretty
sure diabetes won't kill me

184
00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:42.440
at this point. When I
first was diagnosed, I was

185
00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:44.480
like, okay, now I know
the thing that will kill

186
00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:47.000
me, and it's going to
kill me slowly. And now

187
00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:50.990
20 years on with no
side effects and low average

188
00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:54.820
glucose, it's pretty clear that
I could potentially Die of

189
00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:57.370
old age. And it's funny
to say that, but it's

190
00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:00.730
important for a diabetic to
feel like, you know, I

191
00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:03.910
could die of old age
and that's morbid, but also

192
00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:08.100
exactly what I'm supposed to
die of. Right? Exactly. You

193
00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:10.740
know, and I think even
for people like you, who

194
00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:14.100
do an amazing job of
controlling their blood sugar, I

195
00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:16.260
think that this has something
to offer. Because as you

196
00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.470
mentioned earlier, you spend a
lot of time thinking about

197
00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:22.290
your diabetes. I, you know,
I don't know what percentage

198
00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:25.830
of your brain is constantly
thinking about sort of maintaining

199
00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:30.210
your health, but it's, it's
gotta be some significant portion.

200
00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:34.170
And one always wonders. What,
what additional things you could

201
00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:40.150
do if you didn't have
this constant task? I, I

202
00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:42.210
mentioned to people, you know,
what if you had to

203
00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:45.420
remember to breathe? I mean,
it's not quite that frequent,

204
00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:48.810
but you know, you, you
can't forget to manage your

205
00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:50.910
blood glucose. If you have
type one diabetes, cause you

206
00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:53.430
will wind up in trouble
so fast and people who

207
00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:57.960
don't have diabetes have a
very hard time conceiving of

208
00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:01.410
a recurrent task like that.
That's just resemble relentless and

209
00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:04.860
they, and they can never
let it slip or disaster

210
00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:07.920
will ensue. Definitely. One of
those things where when you

211
00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:11.100
meet, I've actually met type
ones who live in small

212
00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:13.680
towns or don't have another
type one to hang out

213
00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:17.790
with. And when we talk,
there's a bonding where their

214
00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:20.490
family doesn't really understand, like
even my wife I've been

215
00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:23.340
married to for 15 years,
you know, she mostly gets

216
00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:26.250
it, but you know, she
wasn't awake at 4:00 AM when

217
00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:29.520
I had a low and
she was already gone when

218
00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:32.370
I woke up with a
high, because I overshot the

219
00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:34.530
low, I woke up, took
a bunch of sugar and

220
00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:37.830
then went back to sleep.
So last night, even as

221
00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:40.110
a good diabetic was a
lousy night. I had a

222
00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:44.040
middle of the night down
at 40, which is quite

223
00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:46.770
low for those who are
listening and then woke up

224
00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:49.080
at 200 and all that
made me feel was a

225
00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:51.570
lot of guilt about what
allows the diabetic. I was

226
00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:55.800
for that for me, Period,
you know, that's really unfortunate.

227
00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.780
I mean, a lot of
people take it on that

228
00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:04.590
way. And unfortunately, sometimes physicians
encourage that because I think

229
00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:07.170
they, you know, they'll sort
of scold people with diabetes

230
00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:09.900
if they're not meeting their,
their blood sugar goals where

231
00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:13.770
as if they were some
goals that were separate from

232
00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:16.020
the person with diabetes themselves,
I mean, of course everyone

233
00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:19.920
with diabetes wants to avoid
complications, wants to keep their

234
00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:22.290
blood sugar under good control.
The problem is it's just

235
00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:27.240
fiendishly difficult to do. And
you know, in the course

236
00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:30.030
of our research, we've discovered
even more reasons why it's

237
00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:33.660
ridiculously difficult to do. So.
I mentioned that speed of

238
00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:37.510
insulin absorption being so variable
from person to person. We,

239
00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:39.810
we found one individual who
participated in one of our

240
00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:43.920
studies. I said the average
time to peak concentrations in

241
00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:46.830
blood for Humalog, which is
one of the quote unquote

242
00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:51.000
rapid acting insulins is 70
minutes in our, in our,

243
00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:54.410
of patients. Well, in his
case, it was 180 minutes

244
00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:59.210
took over three hours. Yep.
And you know, that's just

245
00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:01.820
impossible to manage your blood
glucose when it's absorbed that

246
00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:04.430
slowly, you'd have to take
your insulin for lunch at

247
00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:07.240
breakfast, you know? Nope. I
am one of the two,

248
00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.340
two and a half hour
people myself. And I know

249
00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:11.560
exactly. And actually we should
explain that to the listeners,

250
00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:13.990
the analogy that I use
and I'd be interested in,

251
00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:15.760
if you think it's a
good one is the idea

252
00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:18.220
of, imagine you're trying to
fly an airplane from New York

253
00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:21.820
to LA and you can
move the stick, which allows

254
00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:23.350
you to go up and
down. And you look at

255
00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:25.810
the altimeter and that gives
you a sense of, you

256
00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:27.670
know, whether you're going to
hit the ground or whether

257
00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:29.800
you're going to fly away
into the space into space.

258
00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:32.380
But the trick with diabetes
and the trick with flying

259
00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:34.960
this particular airplane is that
when you look at the

260
00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:39.130
altimeter, you're seeing not your
current altitude, but your altitude

261
00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:41.890
in the past, we call
that lag. Maybe you're seeing

262
00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:45.040
your altitude 15 minutes ago,
and then you push forward

263
00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:47.350
on the stick to make
a dramatic motion, but it

264
00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:49.840
doesn't really do anything. And
it won't hit until like

265
00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:52.870
in your case, you mentioned
180 minutes. So how do

266
00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:55.540
I make a judgment based
on data from the past,

267
00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:59.410
make a change in my,
in my direction and my

268
00:15:59.410 --> 00:16:03.070
altitude, but nothing happens. It's
almost like controlling a Amar

269
00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:05.830
on the Mars Lander. I
pushed the Jordan. That's worse

270
00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:10.270
than that. It's worse than
that because there's unexpected, downdrafts

271
00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:14.470
and updrafts trying to change
your altitude as well. Other

272
00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:18.220
unmeasured things, you know, that
that can dramatically affect it.

273
00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:21.970
So for instance, physical exercise,
even very moderate physical exercise

274
00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:26.230
can cause dramatic drops in
the blood glucose because the

275
00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:29.590
muscles take up glucose is
energy and they are not

276
00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:32.770
dependent on insulin to do
that. So that that's another

277
00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:39.070
variable that comes into play.
That it's as if you

278
00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:42.390
have all these other players
trying to move, move the

279
00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:44.800
stick in different directions. And
you're still trying to make

280
00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:47.590
all the corrections for all
that stuff. It's, it's really

281
00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:50.980
tricky, but even worse than
that, sometimes exercise makes your

282
00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:54.010
blood glucose go up. And
it depends on the balance

283
00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:58.150
of that glucose uptake in
the muscle versus the catecholomines,

284
00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:02.650
the epinephrine, norepinephrine fight or
flight. So people in competition,

285
00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:05.800
blood glucose usually goes up
or people exercising very hard.

286
00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:09.040
Their blood glucose typically cause
up, but moderate exercise. It

287
00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:13.150
tends to go down and
there's innumerable other things like

288
00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:15.370
how fast your food is
absorbed and so forth. It

289
00:17:15.370 --> 00:17:20.860
makes it makes it really
just absurdly difficult. If you

290
00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:23.380
only get to make a
few adjustments in that, on

291
00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:28.000
that altimeter stick a day.
And that's basically what people

292
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.280
do. You know, they, they,
if they get really good

293
00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:33.040
control, often they check and
make some adjustment up to

294
00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:36.190
10 times a day. But
what this system does, the

295
00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:39.580
bionic pancreas does is it
makes an adjustment 288 times

296
00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:42.220
a day. And so you
have to invest a lot

297
00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:45.220
less in each of those
decisions and you have a

298
00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:48.190
lot of opportunities to correct
things if they didn't go

299
00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:51.900
as you planned, or if
there's some unmeasured variable that

300
00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:54.750
comes into play. And so
the amount of insulin you

301
00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:58.830
gave didn't have the expected
effect. Well, the system knows

302
00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:02.070
that and can make a
further adjustment and you don't

303
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:04.430
have to pay any attention
to make that happen. So

304
00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:06.350
let's, let's dig into that
a little bit right now,

305
00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:09.020
I have a pump with
one thing and it, which

306
00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:11.300
is insulin. And I can
either eat to make my

307
00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:13.820
blood sugar go up or
add insulin to bring it

308
00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:16.250
down. And unfortunately, if I
have a lot of lows,

309
00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:18.440
I can actually gain a
lot of weight. I see

310
00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:21.080
number of people who gained
weight, which causes problems with

311
00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:23.270
their diabetes because they only
way they can bring their

312
00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:26.540
blood sugar up is by
eating more. And it's surprising

313
00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:29.450
how you can put another
six to 800 calories in

314
00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:32.120
your head just because you're
trying to get out of

315
00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:36.230
low blood sugars. What this
adds is glucagon, which in

316
00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:38.180
my experience is one of
those things that you keep

317
00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:41.240
in the fridge in an
emergency, it's a big shot,

318
00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:44.270
like in pulp fiction where
someone's on the ground and

319
00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:45.890
they have low blood sugar
could get the glucagon and

320
00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:49.010
we bring them back to
life. You're doing, you're putting

321
00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:52.820
glucagon in another pump, a
parallel chamber as it were,

322
00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:57.200
and delivering that a little
bit at a time And

323
00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:01.490
using much smaller doses. That's
right. So glucagon currently is

324
00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:04.250
used, as you've mentioned as
a rescue for a such

325
00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:07.280
a severe hypoglycemia, that the
person is unable to even

326
00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:10.700
eat unable, to take carbs
into their mouth with assistance.

327
00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:13.910
So they're unconscious. And the
only way to bring them

328
00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:16.280
up is to either give
them an IV of glucose,

329
00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:19.460
which isn't always available or
to use this glucagon. And

330
00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:22.490
what the glucagon does. It
acts on the liver. When

331
00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:26.420
you eat a meal, the
liver stores, the sugar that

332
00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:29.420
you eat in the form
of a polymer called glycogen,

333
00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:32.390
just strings up a bunch
of sugar molecules together in

334
00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:35.510
this branching polymer and stores
it in the liver. So

335
00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:38.390
you can actually store a
tremendous amount of glucose in

336
00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:42.290
the liver. And normally what
happens if the, if the

337
00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:45.770
pancreas is working right, is
that when the blood glucose

338
00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:49.430
starts to fall because you're
using up glucose and there's

339
00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:53.270
no additional glucose coming from
the gut, this glucagon is

340
00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:57.860
released and it liberates that
sugar from the liver. It

341
00:19:57.860 --> 00:20:03.050
breaks down that polymer, that
carbohydrate polymer called glycogen and

342
00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:07.130
releases that sugar into the
bloodstream. And in the huge,

343
00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:09.830
massive dose that you take
in the case of severe

344
00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:12.560
low, the idea is to
get as much glucose into

345
00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:15.110
the bloodstream as possible. So
the person can wake up

346
00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:19.640
and then take some carbohydrates.
Unfortunately, a side effect of

347
00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:22.340
these very high doses of
glucagon is often nausea and

348
00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:26.270
vomiting. So it's a tremendously
unpleasant experience to get to

349
00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:30.020
the point of being one
unconscious from hypoglycemia, and then

350
00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:32.480
being woken up by a
drug that makes you intensely

351
00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:37.730
nauseated, not, not a, not
a nice thing. However, what

352
00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:40.490
we do is we give
very tiny doses of glucagon,

353
00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:43.850
more consistent with the normal
doses that the pancreas would

354
00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:46.880
have given if it were
able to do so. And

355
00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:49.810
we, we try and prevent
those lows from ever happening

356
00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:51.880
by just giving a little
nudge. If the blood glucose

357
00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:53.620
starts to dip, we just
give a little bit of

358
00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:56.890
glucagon and nudge it back
up again. Or if it's

359
00:20:56.890 --> 00:21:00.190
dropping fast, we may give
even larger amounts, but still

360
00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:04.750
quite small compared to the,
the rescue dose, the largest

361
00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:07.480
dose our system can give
at any one, time is

362
00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:12.850
8% of that full rescue
dose of, of medicine. And

363
00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:16.330
one thing I should mention
is that, you know, everybody

364
00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:19.240
who has type one knows,
and most people who understand

365
00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:22.030
something about type one, know
that the reason you have

366
00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:24.190
type one in the first
place is that your immune

367
00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:30.130
system went off kilter and
attacked your beta cells, the

368
00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:33.670
insulin producing cells in the
pancreas. But what is less

369
00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:38.710
commonly appreciated is that once
that happens, the alpha cells

370
00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:42.100
that make the glucagon for
reasons, we don't fully understand,

371
00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:45.040
stop working right as well,
even though they're not destroyed,

372
00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:48.370
even though they're still there,
they no longer release glucagon

373
00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:52.960
in response to low blood
sugars. And so what's missing

374
00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:55.870
in type one is not
just the insulin. It's also

375
00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:59.380
the glucagon. And that leaves
people with type one, very

376
00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:01.750
vulnerable to low blood sugars.
And what we're trying to

377
00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:04.150
do is replace both of
those functions, not just the

378
00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:09.660
insulin function, but the glucagon
function as well. Other hormones

379
00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:11.820
aren't is not amylin. And
another, a couple of other

380
00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:16.050
things, diabetes, isn't just the
removal of one hormone in

381
00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:19.690
your system. That's right. So
the two that are probably

382
00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:23.190
the, by far, the most
important are the insulin and

383
00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:27.300
the glucagon, but there is
also amylin, which is released

384
00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:31.380
every time insulin is released,
it's it's in the same

385
00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:34.590
granules. And so when the
cells release insulin, they release

386
00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:40.290
amylin. It's, there's still some
debate about whether amylin has

387
00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:45.210
benefits in and of itself
independent of, of insulin, but

388
00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:49.860
there is a company that
is trying to replace amylin

389
00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:52.260
as well with the idea
that that may reduce some

390
00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:59.040
diabetes complications. I, I'm not
a hundred percent convinced of

391
00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:02.160
that. And I, I think
there's still more work to

392
00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:04.080
do, to know whether that's
the case or not, but,

393
00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:07.560
but clearly the lack of
influence and the lack of

394
00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:13.590
proper regulation of glucagon are
primarily responsible for the difficulty

395
00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:18.390
in controlling blood sugars in
Taiwan. Hi, this is Scott.

396
00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:21.390
I really appreciate our sponsors

403
00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:58.280
using our airplane analogy in
that yield. You'll use the

404
00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:01.850
CGM to detect that the
airplane is losing altitude quickly,

405
00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:05.720
and the glucagon is the
pull up pull up that

406
00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:08.810
allows you to dramatically and
quickly level the plane out

407
00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:10.880
and make sure that it
doesn't crash into the ground.

408
00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:14.860
That's right. That's a nice
thing about the glucagon is

409
00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:18.190
that it's absorbed much faster
than insulin. So, whereas insulin

410
00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:20.860
has this problem that once
you give it, its Zuora

411
00:24:20.890 --> 00:24:23.950
very slowly and then it
clears very slowly. Glucagon is

412
00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:26.770
absorbed much faster. It has
an average time to peak

413
00:24:26.770 --> 00:24:30.520
levels and blood of about
15 to 20 minutes. And

414
00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:35.350
so it's extraordinarily fast compared
to, to insulin, which is

415
00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:37.240
pretty important. If you're going
to use it in that

416
00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:41.380
capacity of, of, of interrupting
a drop in blood glucose,

417
00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:45.130
It seemed like a and
again, speaking as a layman,

418
00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:47.530
looking at some of the
appendices, and of course people

419
00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:49.600
can go up and look
in the show notes and

420
00:24:50.050 --> 00:24:52.960
explore the entire study, as
well as the dependencies that

421
00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:55.840
some of the graphs looked
to me as a layman

422
00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:59.740
in that the, the bionic
pancreas would put quite a

423
00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:02.680
lot of insulin in the
system in response to a

424
00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:07.600
high, bring the sugar down
quite quickly, and then bolus

425
00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:12.130
a, a glucagon that would
cause someone to use a

426
00:25:12.130 --> 00:25:14.530
lot more insulin in over
the course of a day

427
00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:18.070
than, than, and then I
use, You know, it's interesting

428
00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:22.540
that we really didn't see
that. So the, the clearest

429
00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:26.230
data for that is in
the kids. So in the,

430
00:25:26.290 --> 00:25:30.580
in the pediatric study, which
involved adolescents, the kids served

431
00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:32.860
as their own control. So
they had a control period,

432
00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:35.470
and then they had a
bionic pancreas period. And the

433
00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:38.080
reason I'm gonna focus on
that one first is because

434
00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:41.320
they ate the same meals
during the two arms of

435
00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:44.890
the studies. And we could
confirm that they really did.

436
00:25:44.890 --> 00:25:47.800
They had the same number
of carbohydrates. And so the

437
00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:51.490
bionic pancreas lowered their average
blood glucose, and it reduced

438
00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:53.710
the amount of hypoglycemia they
had and the number of

439
00:25:53.710 --> 00:25:56.770
times they had to take
carbohydrates, but it didn't change

440
00:25:56.770 --> 00:25:59.950
the amount of insulin they
used. So you can certainly

441
00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:04.570
point to places where it
looks like that, you know,

442
00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:08.260
had we had, we been
able to more finely calibrate

443
00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:10.660
the insulin. We could've used
a little bit less than

444
00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:12.730
then. We wouldn't have had
to use as much glucagon.

445
00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:16.780
And I certainly see those
places as well. On average,

446
00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:19.780
the kids didn't actually use
any more insulin, even though

447
00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:23.320
we lowered their blood glucose
in the depends on the

448
00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:28.810
person. Well, The, the appendices
indicated that 11 of the

449
00:26:28.810 --> 00:26:33.100
patients used ha 50% more
insulin during the bionic period.

450
00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:35.980
Let me adult study. So
I'll move on to the

451
00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:38.710
adult study next. So in
the adult study, what we

452
00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:42.970
found is that in about
half of the half of

453
00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:47.040
subjects had an average blood
glucose during the usual care

454
00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:50.790
arm, that was well controlled.
They had an average that

455
00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:52.350
would have given them an
a one C less than

456
00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:55.200
7% and half had an
average that would be above

457
00:26:55.200 --> 00:27:00.000
that point. But people who
under usual care had well-controlled

458
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.330
blood glucose also had well
controlled blood glucose with the

459
00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:06.900
bionic pancreas, and they didn't
use any different amount of

460
00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:10.920
insulin between farms, the people
who had high average blood

461
00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:15.570
sugars under usual care, had
a, a much more dramatic

462
00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:17.910
lowering of their average blood
glucose than the cohort as

463
00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:20.880
a whole, of course, because,
you know, the average went

464
00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:22.950
down and if, if you
are already low, you didn't

465
00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:25.320
change much. So they were
responsible for most of the

466
00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:28.380
drop in the, in the
blood glucose. And they did

467
00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:31.680
in fact use more insulin,
but one could argue that

468
00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:34.830
they just weren't using enough
to begin with because they

469
00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:38.730
had high blood glucose. The
other thing that's that we

470
00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:41.820
didn't really emphasize in the
paper, we also looked at

471
00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:45.690
the carbohydrate intake of the
adults, and we weren't quite

472
00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:49.440
as confident in our measurements
there, we were very confident

473
00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:52.470
in how many grams of
carbohydrates they ate a day

474
00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:56.100
during the bionic pancreas period,
because we documented that ourselves,

475
00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:58.170
they, you know, they had
a nurse with them. And

476
00:27:58.170 --> 00:28:02.280
so we took pictures of
their meals and we know

477
00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:05.250
that we didn't miss any.
And we know that under

478
00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:08.640
those circumstances ate about 150
grams of carbohydrate a day

479
00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:12.570
on average, we also have
them document with a camera

480
00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:15.120
and some note taking how
many carbs they eat at

481
00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:18.780
home. And based on those
records, they ate an average

482
00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:21.030
of a hundred grams of
carbohydrates a day at home.

483
00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:24.150
So that would say the
50% more carbs on the

484
00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:27.960
bionic pancreas. And that would
be pretty consistent with what

485
00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:30.450
they told us anecdotally. They
said, well, you know, I,

486
00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:33.060
I went out to the
North end when I was

487
00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:35.130
on the bionic pancreas that
I had this huge plate

488
00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:36.720
of pasta, and I never
would have done that if

489
00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:40.560
I was not in the
biotic thing. So, so we

490
00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:43.590
think that part of that
increased insulin usage may also

491
00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:45.000
be due to the fact
that they had a lot

492
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.320
more carbs on the bionic
pancreas arm, but we weren't

493
00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:52.170
a hundred percent sure that
they hadn't missed anything when

494
00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:53.760
they were at home. So
we didn't want to make

495
00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:57.720
a quantitative statement. So it,
it, it, it could be

496
00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:00.090
that it was less than
a 50% increase, but we

497
00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:01.860
know that there was an
increase in the amount of

498
00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:04.170
carbs on the bionic pancreas
arm. And that could also

499
00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:06.660
have accounted for part of
the increase in insulin usage,

500
00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:09.240
especially in people who had
high blood sugars on the

501
00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:12.980
usual care. That makes sense.
I mean, people aren't lying

502
00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:15.350
in bed for a week
on the pancreas, they're living

503
00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:17.900
their lives and they're trying
things out and I'm sure

504
00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:20.090
I would go and have
pizza and ice cream if

505
00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:22.760
I was on a bionic
pancreas. Yeah. Well, I mean,

506
00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:26.720
one woman was tweeting, you
know, and blogging during it.

507
00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:28.700
And she's like, I just
had nine bowls of ice

508
00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:35.660
cream for dessert. Wow. Oh,
okay. Yeah. Not the behavior

509
00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:38.510
we're trying to promote. Yeah,
exactly. You should keep in

510
00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:41.950
mind that this having type
one will protect you from

511
00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:45.460
also getting type two. But,
you know, I, I think

512
00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:47.470
that, you know, as time
went on, people would get

513
00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:50.560
over that new car, you
know, sort of sense of

514
00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:52.840
let me go out and
race this thing 150 miles

515
00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:55.270
an hour on the freeway,
and they would settle back

516
00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:58.480
into their lives. But, and
I think this will become

517
00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:02.700
more clear as we do
much longer studies. What do

518
00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:05.430
you and the team think
about some of the excitement

519
00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:10.620
around do it yourself systems
like the DIY pancreas or

520
00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:14.130
projects like Nightscout, where they
taking continuous glucose meters and

521
00:30:14.130 --> 00:30:17.430
projecting their data into the
cloud. These are systems that

522
00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:20.460
do not have the by
hormonal option. They don't have

523
00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:23.880
dual pumping, but they're getting
some pretty amazing results without

524
00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:29.370
the glucagon pull up option.
So are these groups that

525
00:30:29.370 --> 00:30:32.670
are, are hacking their pumps
as well, so that they

526
00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:36.510
are, are they just doing
the, the monitor, you know,

527
00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:39.720
like remote monitoring of, of
kids and getting the CGM

528
00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:44.010
data to the parents, Some
are hacking their pumps. The

529
00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:46.860
beginning of them is the
math doing the algorithm. So

530
00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:51.900
for example, DIY pancreas, a
system has two CGMs. The

531
00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:54.990
one is enclosed in a
box with a cell phone,

532
00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:56.880
similar to the bionic pancreas.
It sends it up to

533
00:30:56.880 --> 00:31:01.110
the cloud for analysis, and
then it recommends a bolus.

534
00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:03.270
And then the individual has
to go and make that,

535
00:31:03.490 --> 00:31:08.070
that final decision as opposed
to an automatic tool. Yeah.

536
00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:11.430
And, and one individual has
seen a onesies drop, you

537
00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:13.680
know, a percent and a
half. So going from seven

538
00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:16.410
and a half down to
six, and they're doing this

539
00:31:16.410 --> 00:31:20.430
without a glucagon. So my
question is, you know, do

540
00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:24.000
you anticipate that an artificial
pancreas could be in any

541
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.720
way successful or the algorithm
could work if you deemphasized

542
00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:32.040
the, the glucagon? Well, there
are certainly groups out there

543
00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:36.870
working on artificial pancreas systems
that don't use glucagon, and

544
00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:41.760
we think they probably could
do better. And they've shown

545
00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:44.730
they can do much better
than usual care using just

546
00:31:44.730 --> 00:31:48.090
modulation of the insulin. So
you can, you know, you

547
00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:51.240
can reduce the amount of
hypoglycemia you can improve the

548
00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:54.060
time and range and reduce
the average blood glucose. So

549
00:31:54.570 --> 00:31:57.270
I, I wouldn't, you know,
I don't think that you

550
00:31:57.330 --> 00:32:02.250
absolutely need glucagon to improve
on the current standard of

551
00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:05.970
care, but that's in large
part because the current standard

552
00:32:05.970 --> 00:32:09.410
of care for many people,
isn't very good. If you,

553
00:32:09.410 --> 00:32:11.640
if you look at the
average A1C in the U

554
00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:15.810
S population for adults, it's
somewhere between eight and 8.5%.

555
00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:21.090
So I think that many
of these systems will dramatically

556
00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:24.780
improve on that. We're trying
to develop something that will

557
00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:30.690
really almost completely lift the
burden of diabetes, reduce the

558
00:32:30.690 --> 00:32:33.510
amount that people have to
do fully automate blood glucose

559
00:32:33.510 --> 00:32:35.970
control. And we think the
only way you can really

560
00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.140
automate blood glucose control is
to have a way to

561
00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:43.190
raise the blood glucose without
having to take carbs. But

562
00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:46.310
I, I think that you
could certainly get improvements using

563
00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:48.920
insulin only systems. We're just
trying to go a step

564
00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:55.490
beyond what is probably achievable
with insulin only based systems.

565
00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:58.910
And the other thing that's
important to note is that

566
00:32:58.910 --> 00:33:02.060
you can always lower the
average. So the question is,

567
00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:04.910
can you lower the average
without increasing the amount of

568
00:33:04.910 --> 00:33:11.630
hypoglycemia and, or, or even
reducing the amount of hypoglycemia?

569
00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:14.390
And I think it's our
goal to bring everybody into

570
00:33:14.390 --> 00:33:17.540
a average blood glucose range
that would give them a

571
00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:20.930
onesies less than 7% or
less than six and a

572
00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:24.290
half percent. But at the
same time, reduce the amount

573
00:33:24.290 --> 00:33:27.530
of hypoglycemia to a very,
very low level and completely

574
00:33:27.530 --> 00:33:32.930
eliminate dangerous hypoglycemia. That's the
goal. And because there are

575
00:33:32.930 --> 00:33:39.050
elements of glucose regulation, which
are independent of insulin, we

576
00:33:39.050 --> 00:33:44.090
don't think that you can
really optimally reduce hypoglycemia without

577
00:33:44.090 --> 00:33:47.630
the glucagon. So for instance,
exercise is an Achilles heel

578
00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:51.800
for any insulin dependent system
is if you have unplanned

579
00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:54.380
exercise, so you don't plan
for an hour in advance

580
00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:57.860
by reducing your basal rate,
and you go into that

581
00:33:57.860 --> 00:34:00.350
exercise with the blood glucose
and target range, you are

582
00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:05.890
going to go low almost
inevitably, right? Yeah. The system

583
00:34:05.890 --> 00:34:07.810
that you have right now
is kind of a proof

584
00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:10.180
of concept, and I'm saying
this, this is my words.

585
00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:12.910
I see, you know, two
pumps and a system wrapped

586
00:34:12.910 --> 00:34:15.580
around an iPhone and a
CGM. It's a lot of

587
00:34:15.790 --> 00:34:18.880
moving parts. Do you anticipate
that there's going to be

588
00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:20.950
a future where it really
is kind of an integrated

589
00:34:20.950 --> 00:34:25.300
device, a dual chamber pump,
an integrated brain. You're using

590
00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:28.300
the iPhone in this case
as the easy to program

591
00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:31.990
algorithm maker. But I presume
that the dream is a

592
00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:34.900
pump sized dual chamber device
that I keep in my

593
00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:37.780
pocket and I don't think
about it. That's correct. And

594
00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:40.580
in fact, my colleagues at,
and for us are, are

595
00:34:40.630 --> 00:34:43.630
working with some industrial partners
to build exactly that device

596
00:34:43.630 --> 00:34:48.730
now. And the thought is
that the first generation device

597
00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:52.960
will not be, you know,
reach maximum miniaturization, but it

598
00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:56.710
will be about the size
of an iPhone and about

599
00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:59.170
twice as thick. So a
little larger than a current

600
00:34:59.170 --> 00:35:03.550
insulin pump, but certainly possible
to put it in your

601
00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:06.340
pocket or clip it on
a belt. And that would

602
00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:08.770
have the two pump chambers.
It would have the CGM

603
00:35:08.770 --> 00:35:12.490
receiver, it would have all
the logic for the algorithm

604
00:35:12.490 --> 00:35:15.760
and it would have a
display screen. So you could

605
00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:19.840
see what your blood glucose
was doing and what the

606
00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:22.030
algorithm was doing in terms
of dosing of insulin and

607
00:35:22.030 --> 00:35:24.760
glucagon. And then also a
way to interact with the

608
00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:28.060
device to for instance, announced
meals. If you chose to

609
00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:32.410
do that or to use
some of the other features

610
00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:36.010
that we've now built in.
So for instance, a new

611
00:35:36.010 --> 00:35:38.520
feature in the system that
we're using in our current

612
00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:43.710
study is that the user
can choose the target. They

613
00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:46.620
can decide to raise the
target blood glucose with the

614
00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:50.700
device by up to 30
milligrams per deciliter. And so

615
00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:53.550
in all of our current,
on all of our previous

616
00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:56.250
studies, the target was a
hundred milligrams per deciliter. This

617
00:35:56.250 --> 00:36:00.870
system didn't achieve that, but
that was the target. And

618
00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:03.960
there were people that had
very low average blood glucose

619
00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:07.140
is, you know, I think
our lowest was 109 milligrams

620
00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:11.010
per deciliter. Over five days.
There is no, probably no

621
00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:14.610
reason to have an average
blood glucose that low we

622
00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:17.930
don't. Yeah. Even though that's
what a normal person has

623
00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:23.030
or lower. Yeah, that's right.
If you look at data

624
00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:26.780
on, you know, from these
interventional trials, it looks like

625
00:36:26.810 --> 00:36:31.220
if you get below an
average blood glucose of 140

626
00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:35.990
or 150, there's almost no
detectable signal for increased eye

627
00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:41.750
complications. For instance, there is
an interesting experiment of nature

628
00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:44.630
in people who have mutations
in one of the genes

629
00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:48.740
that is responsible for bringing
glucose into the cell. And

630
00:36:48.770 --> 00:36:53.450
it, it affects the, the
beta cells of the pancreas.

631
00:36:53.450 --> 00:36:56.240
So that in essence, that
changes their set point for

632
00:36:56.240 --> 00:37:01.070
insulin secretion. And those people
from birth have an average

633
00:37:01.070 --> 00:37:05.870
blood glucose of 150, but
a well controlled average blood

634
00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:09.320
glucose. In other words, they,
they regulate to that target

635
00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:12.080
just like people without diabetes
regulate to the target of

636
00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:16.430
about 90 or 80. And
they have no diabetes complications

637
00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:19.910
whatsoever. So that implies that
it is the dramatic variance

638
00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:22.280
and the roller coaster that
hurts us as much as

639
00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:27.920
it is the, the, the
high average blood. Well, actually,

640
00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:30.620
no, I, I think from
the studies that are out

641
00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:34.010
there, that most of it
is because most people have

642
00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:39.200
an average that's above 150.
So the recommendation of the

643
00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:42.620
American diabetes association is to
aim for an A1C, which

644
00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:45.500
is this measure of your
average blood glucose over three

645
00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:49.460
months of less than 7%,
that is equivalent to an

646
00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:54.260
average blood glucose of 154.
No, the reason for that

647
00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:58.730
recommendation is that it was
found in the landmark DCCT

648
00:37:58.730 --> 00:38:02.900
or diabetes control and complications
trial trial. That if you

649
00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:05.930
kept the average blood glucose
below that point, you dramatically

650
00:38:05.930 --> 00:38:10.100
reduce the incidence of complications
and the progression of complications

651
00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:13.190
that had already started. So
we don't think it's necessary

652
00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:18.650
to get down to normal
blood glucose's to almost entirely

653
00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:24.290
eliminate the risk of complications.
And you, it's easier to,

654
00:38:25.850 --> 00:38:28.340
it's easier to achieve an
average blood glucose of say

655
00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:33.110
140 without hypoglycemia than it
is to achieve an average

656
00:38:33.110 --> 00:38:37.930
blues of 110 without hypoglycemia.
So the reason we put

657
00:38:37.930 --> 00:38:39.880
this feature in is if
somebody was say getting an

658
00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:42.850
average blood glucose on the
device, the adaptation of the

659
00:38:42.850 --> 00:38:45.970
device wound up settling with
an average glucose of say

660
00:38:45.970 --> 00:38:49.690
110, but they were spending
5% of their time with

661
00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:53.470
a CGM glucose, less than
60. Well, they could say,

662
00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:55.780
you know what, I don't
want to be 110. I

663
00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:58.750
want to be 130 and
have less than 1% of

664
00:38:58.750 --> 00:39:02.410
my time hypoglycemic. Now they
have the flexibility to do

665
00:39:02.410 --> 00:39:06.610
that. So it's, it's sort
of an additional level of

666
00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:09.880
control on top of the
adaptation that the algorithm automatically

667
00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:12.750
does. And that'll be great
for kids as well. We

668
00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:15.600
usually recommend that kids under,
you know, 15 try to

669
00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:18.720
stay around one 50, well,
a kind of an uptight

670
00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:21.660
programmer type like myself might
want to aim for one

671
00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:25.080
10. And now we would
have that, that flexibility. I

672
00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:29.610
have found though that my
CGM changes its values, depending

673
00:39:29.610 --> 00:39:32.340
on positioning. I'll find that
it might think that I'm

674
00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:34.710
60 while I'm sleeping. And
then when I wake up

675
00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:37.530
and the interstitial fluids in
my body start to come

676
00:39:37.530 --> 00:39:40.350
together, as well as that
just the general Dawn effect

677
00:39:40.350 --> 00:39:43.140
and waking up, I can
see very dramatic numbers, all

678
00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:45.690
of this hinges on the
accuracy of the CGM, doesn't

679
00:39:45.690 --> 00:39:49.500
it? It does. And that's
why when we chose the

680
00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:51.720
CGM, we were going to
use, we, we actually put

681
00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:54.900
a lot of work into
that. We did two separate

682
00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:58.380
studies, both of which are
available on our website, where

683
00:39:58.380 --> 00:40:02.340
we tested all the currently
available, continuous glucose monitoring devices,

684
00:40:02.370 --> 00:40:05.670
head to head, to head
against each other. And, and

685
00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:08.490
we chose the one that
for each of the phases

686
00:40:08.490 --> 00:40:10.320
of our study, that was
the most accurate at the

687
00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:14.220
time that we did those
comparisons. And so currently we're

688
00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:17.880
using a device from Dexcom
called the Dexcom G for

689
00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:22.140
platinum, which is much more
accurate than the other currently

690
00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:25.500
available CGM device in the
U S, which is made

691
00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:28.740
by Medtronic. And it's called
the, the Enlite sensor it's

692
00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:34.170
associated with their five 30
G pump. And it turns

693
00:40:34.170 --> 00:40:37.320
out the error of the,
of the Medtronic device is

694
00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:39.570
almost twice as large as
the Dexcom device. So we

695
00:40:39.570 --> 00:40:42.660
went with the Dexcom device
and we hope that both

696
00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:45.180
of those companies continue to
innovate and make better products.

697
00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:47.400
And they both say they've
got better accuracy in the

698
00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:51.660
future. But so we, so
we pick the best device

699
00:40:51.690 --> 00:40:54.930
we could pick. We also
came up with some rules

700
00:40:54.930 --> 00:40:59.310
about calibrating that device, cause
the calibrations are key. So

701
00:40:59.310 --> 00:41:03.720
for instance, we ask people
not to calibrate in the

702
00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:07.290
immediate aftermath of eating because
that's a time when the

703
00:41:07.290 --> 00:41:10.860
blood glucose and the CGM
glucose can vary the most.

704
00:41:11.070 --> 00:41:13.140
We know when there's a
rapid rise, for instance, in

705
00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:17.070
blood glucose in a little
while before the interstitial fluid

706
00:41:17.070 --> 00:41:20.640
catches up, that leg varies
a bit, but on average,

707
00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:23.250
it's about seven minutes for
the Dexcom, which isn't too

708
00:41:23.250 --> 00:41:26.160
bad. But if your blood
glucose is rising fast, it

709
00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:28.440
can really amount to a
lot. I mean, if you,

710
00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:31.440
if your blood glucose is
rising, it say three milligrams

711
00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:35.810
per deciliter per minute, a
seven minute lag is over

712
00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:39.140
20 milligrams per deciliter offsets.
So you don't want to

713
00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:42.380
be calibrating at those times.
And we also ask people

714
00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:45.230
not to calibrate in the
immediate aftermath of glucagon doses

715
00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:48.260
for exactly the same reason
because they can cause rapid

716
00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:50.570
rises in blood glucose. And
it can take awhile for

717
00:41:50.570 --> 00:41:54.620
the interstitial fluid that that
is what the CGM measures

718
00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:56.840
to catch up. So we,
we go out of our

719
00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:59.390
way to try and have
the most accurate device. And

720
00:41:59.390 --> 00:42:05.540
then we also have built
in elements of the algorithm

721
00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:09.800
to try and compensate to
some degree for that lag.

722
00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:12.050
So for instance, if the
blood glucose is falling very

723
00:42:12.050 --> 00:42:16.130
fast, we might step in
by reducing insulin dosing and

724
00:42:16.130 --> 00:42:19.670
treating with glucagon. When the
blood glucose is still relatively

725
00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:22.610
high, as high as 180
milligrams per deciliter, if it's

726
00:42:22.610 --> 00:42:25.340
dropping fast enough, because we
know that the true blood

727
00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:30.560
glucose is lower than that
by some increment, which again

728
00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:33.860
depends on the rate of
fall. So the derivative of

729
00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:36.560
the change in of the
blood glucose with respect to

730
00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:40.610
time is an important variable
in, in the way the

731
00:42:40.610 --> 00:42:44.450
algorithm operates. But as you
point out, if the, if

732
00:42:44.450 --> 00:42:48.230
the CGM is just flat
out inaccurate, then the algorithm

733
00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:51.770
knowing only what the CGM
is telling it could also

734
00:42:51.770 --> 00:42:55.880
be making incorrect decisions. I
will point out. You mentioned

735
00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:58.670
at night, there is a
specific problem at night that

736
00:42:58.670 --> 00:43:01.460
we know of. And that
is if the sensor is

737
00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:04.970
at a place where there
is pressure on the sensor,

738
00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:09.890
we, what happens is that
that seems to squeeze the

739
00:43:09.890 --> 00:43:14.000
interstitial fluid out from around
where the sensor tip is.

740
00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:18.620
And there's a characteristic under
reading of the blood glucose.

741
00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:20.960
In other words, it underestimates
what the blood glucose is,

742
00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:24.680
presumably because that area isn't
being perfused very well. And

743
00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:27.200
the glucose that's in that
interstitial fluid is getting used

744
00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:31.370
up. The good news, at
least for that particular artifact,

745
00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:34.820
is that it's a conservative
one. It will only cause

746
00:43:34.850 --> 00:43:38.840
the device to try and
drive the blood glucose up,

747
00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:42.400
which is a safer thing
to do. Then, you know,

748
00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:46.580
if, if it drives it
up higher, then you'd like,

749
00:43:46.610 --> 00:43:50.030
because it was underestimating the
blood glucose that's safer than

750
00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:53.870
the reverse, which is really
dangerous. If the system, if

751
00:43:53.870 --> 00:43:56.660
the CGM is overestimating, the
blood glucose and the system

752
00:43:56.660 --> 00:43:59.870
is dosing insulin for that,
that's a truly dangerous situation.

753
00:44:00.350 --> 00:44:03.330
Unfortunately we don't know of
a specific situation that, that

754
00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:07.360
causes that artifact. That's true.
I've only had it lied

755
00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:09.890
to me about being high
once or twice in a

756
00:44:09.890 --> 00:44:13.340
year. And usually it's when
there's pressure on the sensor.

757
00:44:14.210 --> 00:44:16.220
And so if you can
put it in places that

758
00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:19.040
avoid that, that's a big,
that's a big help. The

759
00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:21.200
other place where it will
lie to you about being

760
00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:25.280
high, at least in theory
is if you take large

761
00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:31.950
doses of Tylenol or acetaminophen
and the degree to which

762
00:44:31.950 --> 00:44:35.190
this is a problem is
debated to some degree, but

763
00:44:36.180 --> 00:44:38.610
to have the sensors on
the market in the U

764
00:44:38.610 --> 00:44:43.380
S the, both the Dexcom
and the, the Medtronic devices

765
00:44:43.470 --> 00:44:46.050
are sensitive to at least
very high levels of a

766
00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:48.900
sediment effect, and they will
cause it to override the

767
00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:52.710
glucose. So we always recommend
that people not take Tylenol

768
00:44:52.710 --> 00:44:56.940
and take same ibuprofen. Instead
if they're using a continuous

769
00:44:56.940 --> 00:45:02.310
glucose monitor, the late lamented
Abbott navigator, which Abbott pulled

770
00:45:02.310 --> 00:45:05.790
off the market very unfortunately,
was not sensitive to a

771
00:45:05.790 --> 00:45:09.360
sediment. And it's for sale
in Europe right now, but

772
00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:12.590
not in the U S
unfortunately, Well, that's a small

773
00:45:12.590 --> 00:45:14.900
price to pay though. I
think for sure, For better

774
00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:18.290
blood sugar, I hope that
something like this is available.

775
00:45:18.290 --> 00:45:20.630
As soon as someone has
been diabetic for going on

776
00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:23.600
my third decade, it has
always been five years out

777
00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:25.790
of reach. We always joke
about that as diabetics that

778
00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:29.330
just another five years and
we'll have this handled, but

779
00:45:29.330 --> 00:45:32.060
it's nice to see us
moving forward. And maybe you

780
00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:34.040
can promise me in five
years, it'll be even better.

781
00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:38.060
Well, we, we like to
avoid the five-year curse that

782
00:45:38.060 --> 00:45:41.780
you talk about. My, my
collaborator talks about five years

783
00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:44.990
as being the minimum amount
of unaccountable time. In other

784
00:45:44.990 --> 00:45:47.660
words, you can always say
it's five years and no

785
00:45:47.660 --> 00:45:49.700
one could ever sort of
prove you wrong in a,

786
00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:54.830
in a timescale that that
matters. But we knowing that

787
00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:57.710
have tried to be much
more specific about our timeline.

788
00:45:57.710 --> 00:46:00.800
And now we're talking in
terms of months rather than

789
00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:05.120
years. And his goal has
always been to get it

790
00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:07.880
ready for when his son
goes to college, which at

791
00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:10.940
this point is I believe
38 months in the future.

792
00:46:11.540 --> 00:46:14.300
And we have a, we
have a timeline laid out

793
00:46:15.050 --> 00:46:17.960
that can get us there
as long as we can

794
00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:21.740
continue to push forward. Right
now, we've, we've, we've had

795
00:46:21.740 --> 00:46:24.380
a very, we've had very
good luck at getting resources

796
00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:27.200
to do clinical trials. But
one thing that's been much

797
00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:30.050
harder is to get resources,
to do the technology development.

798
00:46:30.530 --> 00:46:33.230
And I, I told you
that we were working on

799
00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:38.180
building this fully integrated system.
And right now that is

800
00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:41.750
a resource limited thing. So
we're hoping that we get

801
00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:44.810
enough resources so that we
can stay on this timeline.

802
00:46:44.810 --> 00:46:47.570
And as long as we
are able to do that

803
00:46:47.570 --> 00:46:52.340
in the next six months
or so, then we'll be

804
00:46:52.340 --> 00:46:54.920
able to stay on our
timeline to get something in

805
00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:57.800
front of the FDA in
early 2017. And if we

806
00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:00.380
can do that, then we
could potentially have approval of

807
00:47:00.380 --> 00:47:03.200
a device by, by the
end of 2017, which is

808
00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:07.010
less than five years away
Is exactly what I like

809
00:47:07.010 --> 00:47:09.110
to hear. And very, very
exciting. And folks who are

810
00:47:09.110 --> 00:47:13.520
listening can go and look
at www dot, bionic pancreas.org,

811
00:47:13.550 --> 00:47:16.400
and learn all about this
stuff. It's a very, very

812
00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:20.090
exciting time to be a
technologist. And I'm looking forward

813
00:47:20.090 --> 00:47:22.070
to dying of old age
and not have diabetes. And

814
00:47:22.070 --> 00:47:26.840
I thank you for all
of you. Yes. Something to

815
00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:32.500
look forward to. Thank you
so much, Dr. Stephen J. Russell. This

816
00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:34.720
has been another episode of
Hansel minutes, and we'll see

817
00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:35.620
you again next week.
