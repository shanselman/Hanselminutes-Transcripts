this episode, Scott talks with
Chris Brooks and Eli Smith

11
00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.920
about the trend in classic
board gaming. Hi, this is

12
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.470
Scott Hanselman. And on this
episode of Hansel minutes, we'll

13
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.950
be talking about board gaming,
classic board gaming for the

14
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.530
programmer. There's a lot of
HDTV out there. A lot

15
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.200
of PlayStation threes, a lot
of 10 ADP going on,

16
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.040
but still more and more
programmers are going to classic

17
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.010
board gaming. And with me,
I've got Chris Brooks, my

18
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.130
CTO here at Kirlian. Who's
also involved in a board

19
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.400
gaming company and I think
a hardcore board gamer and

20
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.310
then my friend, Eli Smith
and other hardcore board gamer.

21
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.730
Hi guys. Hi Scott always
got, so we just came

22
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.610
from a, this Friday, we
were sitting in the Karelian

23
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.610
break room, hanging out. We
had about eight, nine guys

24
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.850
there. A bunch of guys
brought and gals. A bunch

25
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.980
of people brought board games
from home is something we

26
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.740
do at Kirlian. Is it
it's every Friday, every Friday

27
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.680
at lunchtime. And I understand
it's pretty consistent. They said

28
00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.190
that's unusual. Oftentimes that's the
first thing to drop off

29
00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.220
is board gaming on the,
on the being on company

30
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.260
time at the lunch at
the lunch hour, but this

31
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:02.730
has been going on for
the better part of a

32
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.590
year. Isn't it. We've been
doing this for about a

33
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.260
year and a half, and
we have about 15 people

34
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.230
on our distribution list and
we'll get anywhere from five

35
00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:13.890
to eight or nine on
a given day. Now we're

36
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.570
mostly programmers share. There's some
QA everyone's technical. Why are

37
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.910
people turning to board gaming
now? Is this a, is

38
00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.250
this a Renaissance? Is this
a new 21st century thing

39
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.750
or people who've been doing
this for a long time?

40
00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.350
Well, the Renaissance has really
been about what about six,

41
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.890
seven years now with the
advent of settlers of Catan

42
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.110
reaching American shore has really
brought a resurgence of board

43
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.090
game in America. And I
think that the programmers are

44
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.830
attracted to it because it's
a way to unplug and

45
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.310
get back to dealing with
people face to face. It

46
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.340
has the tactile sensation behind
a keyboard. And, and I

47
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.950
think that's what, what people
like about it. And is

48
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.560
it, is it all fundamentally
problem solving or programmers doing

49
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.410
this because it's a problem
solving thing. A here's the

50
00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.580
rules that we work within.
Here's your goal work within

51
00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.650
that, that structure? Yeah, I
think that has something to

52
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.340
do with it. And is
this something that is, you

53
00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.440
said it reached American shores,
so there's a, there's a

54
00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.560
game he's called it. Settlers
of Catan. Chris, would you

55
00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.070
agree that that's when things
started? Yeah, I think the

56
00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:17.040
modern board gaming trend started
about 10 years ago when

57
00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.940
settlers of Catan was released
originally in Germany. And it

58
00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.880
started a new genre of
games that are sometimes called

59
00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.620
German games or Euro games
that was translated. English came

60
00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.640
to the United States and started
a somewhat of a revolution

61
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.300
in board gaming within the
United States. No, I saw that

62
00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.060
both of you sent me
links to a website that

63
00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.830
had a list of your
games. And I see that

64
00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.530
most real hardcore gamers go
to this particular site. They

65
00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.530
have a list, Eli, you've
got 200 plus games. Chris,

66
00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.260
you've got a whole gaming
room. I've, I've got about

67
00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.260
400 games in my collection,
but I'm, I'm trying to

68
00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.330
keep that flat. So I'm
trying to sell or give

69
00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.760
away as many as I
buy in a given year.

70
00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.180
So you remodeled a room
of your house explicitly for

71
00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.940
the purposes of gaming. I've
seen the wall of games

72
00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.850
Walls. Yes. Yes. I, we,
we turned our upstairs kind

73
00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.100
of bonus room that we
have the computers in and

74
00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.260
the kids do a lot
of computer gaming there as

75
00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.210
well. We turn that into
our gaming room and it

76
00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:18.570
has art decoration that has
board game covers and then

77
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.200
lots of shelf space for
my board game collection. And

78
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.090
you've got two kids and
Eli, you just had a

79
00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.910
baby. It seems like programmers
are not only wanting to

80
00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.290
do this, but they want
to share it with their

81
00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:31.140
kids. And is it the
social aspect, the problem solving?

82
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.590
How does this affect like
your kids, Chris? It's a,

83
00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.190
I think to Eli's point
earlier about being unplugged. I

84
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.980
think there is, if you
look at the generation of

85
00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.660
kids today and even 20
somethings, they've grown up immersed

86
00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.600
in technology. And I think
there's a desire on my

87
00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.310
part as a parent to
want to make sure my

88
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.390
kids treasure the face to
face interaction that comes from

89
00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:58.530
social activities, whether it's sports
or sitting down and playing

90
00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.340
a family board game, like,
like we play Now Eli,

91
00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:03.810
how would you say this
is different from the kind

92
00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.550
of the Parker brothers stuff?
I mean, I'm not a

93
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.300
board gamer. I'm, I'm thinking
about getting involved, but from

94
00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.070
my point of view, it's
like, can I really afford

95
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.800
yet another hobby? Am I
going to become a collector?

96
00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.750
Is this going to suck
all my money? I can

97
00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.130
take up, hang gliding. I
have to buy all the

98
00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:18.810
hand gliding equipment. I assume
I have to buy board

99
00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.680
gaming equipment. I do have
sorry and monopoly, but that

100
00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.330
doesn't seem to be the
same kind of thing. It's

101
00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.580
not the same board game.
How is this different than

102
00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.450
Parker brothers? The differences is
basically How much your decisions

103
00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.390
impact, how well you perform
in the game. I'm in

104
00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.700
a lot of Parker, brothers
and more traditional American style

105
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.520
board games. Your choices are
very limited by how well

106
00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.740
you roll dice or what
cards you draw in the

107
00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.140
German games. You have a
lot more decisions to make,

108
00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.450
and those directly impact how
well you perform in the

109
00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:50.340
game. More like chess than
say, sorry, another thing I

110
00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.550
want to add. That's all
too common in, in traditional

111
00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:56.940
American games. And I would
include games like risk and

112
00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.760
where it's not uncommon to
have player elimination where you

113
00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.670
might have a game go
on for four hours. And

114
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.890
there's only two players left
for the last two hours

115
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:09.170
of that game. And I
don't think that's great for

116
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:11.990
a family setting. First, it
encourages beating up on each

117
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.050
other and wanting to be
the only guy left a

118
00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.600
lot of the German games
and even newer American games

119
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.660
that we play have mechanics
built in to keep everybody

120
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:24.020
in the game until the
end and often a disguise

121
00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.300
to some extent who might
be in the lead. So

122
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.100
there's a lot of tension
as you get to the

123
00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.870
end of game of even
knowing who's going to win

124
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:32.500
the game. Yeah. That's a
really interesting point. I didn't

125
00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.570
even think about that. I
mean, they're using the examples

126
00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:37.330
that I just gave of,
sorry, and monopoly risk. You

127
00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.690
all games where people get
pretty worked up. We took,

128
00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:43.450
we played monopoly a couple
of weeks ago and you

129
00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:45.970
know, some of the younger
kids got pretty intense as

130
00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:49.930
they started to attain wealth.
They started to really dog

131
00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:53.290
on the other kids. All
of those games involve elimination.

132
00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:54.880
They drag on and it
does get kind of boring.

133
00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:57.880
We just played a game
called 10 days in Africa.

134
00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:00.190
And there was a lot
of tension. I realized that

135
00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.580
I was like seconds from
winning. And then Chris came

136
00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:06.280
from nowhere and won the
game. I thought that was,

137
00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:09.550
that's a very interesting point.
Now, do you feel that

138
00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:12.610
this helps you in your
programming job and your technical

139
00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:13.960
job? Does it, is it,
is it a more of

140
00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.450
a relaxation or does it
honestly give you a new

141
00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:19.750
ways to think about and
solve problems? I do know

142
00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:22.720
for a fact that people
that work in technology, particularly

143
00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:26.890
programmers tend towards these sorts
of games. If you look

144
00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:30.430
at the communities out there
that are on the internet

145
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:33.250
mailing lists, or even that
come to conventions for these

146
00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:37.300
sorts of games, there's a
pretty significant overlap of technologists

147
00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:40.060
and, and board gamers. So
I think there have to

148
00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:43.420
be some traits in common.
I think your comments before,

149
00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:49.780
around living within a rule
structure, trying to optimize your,

150
00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:53.380
your choices that you make,
even the notion of design

151
00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:57.640
patterns, which are common and
software find their way into,

152
00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.580
into board games in terms
of mechanics that show up

153
00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:02.620
in games. So I do
think there's a lot of

154
00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:06.910
overlap and I think that
it it's just a tendency

155
00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:09.280
based on characteristics of people.
Those that tend to be

156
00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:12.640
more creative and don't like
rules as much. They might

157
00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:16.480
tend more towards party games
that have a lot, even

158
00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:21.730
more social interactions, games like
taboo or Pictionary, where there's

159
00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:24.100
much more of a creative
element. Those sorts of games

160
00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:27.670
actually are not as popular
in most cases in this

161
00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:30.850
board gaming circle, huh? When
we were playing 10 days

162
00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:33.520
in Africa, which was, I've
got a one game that

163
00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.260
you gave me for Christmas
last year that we played

164
00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.690
two on two it's a
card game, but this was

165
00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:39.700
my first time in a
group and a large group.

166
00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:42.070
We're four, four people I
think, played this game, a

167
00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:44.470
larger group. And I was
getting confused with some of

168
00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:46.960
the mechanics. And you said,
Oh, well this is just

169
00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.630
a standard card swapping. You,
you hit some kind of

170
00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:52.770
a LA carte swapping, continuous
building game, you know, it's,

171
00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:54.610
it's very similar to, and
then you rattle off a

172
00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:57.090
number of from games. Is
that the kind of pattern

173
00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:59.310
that you're talking about? I
mean, the, the, the cards

174
00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:01.020
changed the look and feel
change. I know that you

175
00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:04.590
guys admire the packaging, but
there are only so many

176
00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:07.490
ways that you could structure
a game, right? Yeah. That

177
00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:10.070
we've discovered so far. And,
and Eli might want to

178
00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:13.130
comment on this too, but
I think that most games

179
00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:19.940
you find today assemble mechanics
and theme in different ways,

180
00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:23.780
but it's fairly rare to
see a new mechanic. I'm

181
00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:26.450
the one that actually comes
to mind that was the

182
00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:29.150
most innovative in the last
20 years was actually the

183
00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:32.180
magic, the gathering card game,
which I'm sure most people

184
00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:34.670
have heard of. And that
was a craze in the,

185
00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:37.280
in the mid nineties. And
it continues to be popular

186
00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:40.250
today. That's probably, even though
it's not a board game,

187
00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:43.160
that's probably the most innovative
thing that's happened within gaming

188
00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.980
in the last 15 to
20 years. And people are

189
00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.680
sitting around waiting for what's
the next big thing that's

190
00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:51.590
going to hit around mechanics.
But yeah, true. Most of

191
00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:54.020
the MCAT, most of the
games that I play tend

192
00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:56.840
to have very similar mechanics,
but they're often assembled in

193
00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:00.770
interesting ways, Two questions then
first is going to be,

194
00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:02.470
how do you get started?
And we'll talk about that.

195
00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:03.890
Cause I want to hear
your list. If, if I

196
00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:06.290
was going to go out,
which I will after this

197
00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:09.050
interview and buy three, four,
five games and try to,

198
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:11.450
you know, how do you
incorporate this into your life?

199
00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:14.150
Is this just an after
dinner activity? Do you have,

200
00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:16.280
do you guys get together
with groups on the weekends?

201
00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:19.400
What's, what's a good way
to start in, in doing

202
00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:20.900
this, the seat, do you
know, put your foot in

203
00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:23.330
the water and see if
you like playing board games?

204
00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:25.790
Well, if you have interested
friends or family members where

205
00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:28.610
those are going to be
the easiest to approach another

206
00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:32.880
good resource, if you're looking
for meeting more strangers or

207
00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:34.820
playing with a different group
of people, then maybe the

208
00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:37.250
people, you know, they're not
interested as there's lots of

209
00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:40.220
local groups on Yahoo. There's
a group called PDX gamers.

210
00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:43.880
You can join that group.
They have announcements of game

211
00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:46.700
events going on around the
city. That would be Portland.

212
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.280
Since we have an international
crowd, do maybe Craigslist would

213
00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:50.810
be a place to look
for gamers. Do you think?

214
00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:53.870
Or, Well, board game geek
has a whole section devoted

215
00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:57.230
to game groups in local
areas. So you can post

216
00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:58.880
there's a, Hey, I'm looking
for a game group, they've

217
00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:02.390
got it divided by state.
So whatever state you're in,

218
00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:04.220
you can go to that
site post on that forum

219
00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:05.780
and say, Hey, I'm looking
for a game group. It

220
00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:08.360
just requires a free registration.
Yeah. I'm also going to

221
00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.340
refer and these will show
up in the show notes,

222
00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:13.310
but there are actually a
couple of podcasts that I'll

223
00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:17.240
refer listeners to that actually
have kind of an episode

224
00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:20.930
zero of their maybe a
hundred or more podcasts that

225
00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:23.930
focus on what are called
gateway games. How do you

226
00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:26.630
get into the hobby? What
are the best games to

227
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:28.850
get started and say, Hey,
is this something that really

228
00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:32.060
is, is my thing or,
and they're games that you're

229
00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:34.040
likely going to enjoy, but
if you don't like them

230
00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:35.390
a lot, then maybe you
want to look for a

231
00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:38.180
different hobby. I can mention
a few of those games

232
00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:40.670
that will show up in
those podcasts. I think a

233
00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:44.750
one that's come out recently,
that's become extremely popular as

234
00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:47.090
a gateway game, as a
game called ticket to ride.

235
00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:51.770
And this is a game
of building train connections in

236
00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:55.720
America, settlers of Catan, which
we already mentioned is another

237
00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:59.830
great choice and a carcass
on which is a game

238
00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:04.480
about building castles and other
types of buildings. And France

239
00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:08.050
is another very popular one.
And there's a board game

240
00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:10.570
geek that Eli mentioned is
a great website to go

241
00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:14.190
find other games that others
find pockets. Okay, Eli, what

242
00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:17.160
are you, what are your
gateway games? I'm a little

243
00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.980
bit more, since we've seen
this European resurgence, it's also

244
00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:24.510
triggered an American resurgence with
publishers like fantasy flight and,

245
00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:27.120
and a few others here
into the States and they

246
00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:29.760
do it slightly different style
of game. And I like

247
00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.710
a lot of their titles,
especially in those silver line,

248
00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:35.040
which tends more towards those
European mechanics. I really make

249
00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.260
a recommend a DragCon. I
think it's a great game,

250
00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.470
especially for those in the
technical field. It's about building

251
00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:43.290
loops and structures, which are
beneficial to you or detrimental

252
00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:46.740
to your opponent. I love
robo rally. I think that's

253
00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:49.500
a great game. It's about
programming robots with an instruction

254
00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:51.510
set and then setting them
loose to cause chaos on

255
00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:54.750
a factory floor. I really
recommend those games. And just

256
00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:57.920
because you don't like some
of the recommended gateway games,

257
00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:00.480
I say, don't abandon it
right away. You might just

258
00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:02.490
not be playing a game
that suits your taste or

259
00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:05.130
your style. Some people like
more confrontation. Some people like

260
00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.250
less, and there's such a
wide variety out there. It's

261
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.700
really takes some finesse to
find those games that really

262
00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:14.970
match your style and your
personality. And is this going

263
00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:18.150
to be an expensive hobby
for me? It's expensive as

264
00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:20.880
you want it to be.
Now, Chris, I understand that

265
00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:23.580
you actually have, or either
have, or you're a partner

266
00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:26.700
in a board gaming company.
Yes. I'm one of the

267
00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:30.000
founders and owners of a
game company called sun river

268
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.500
games. It's very much a
moonlighting venture for me. And

269
00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:37.260
about three of my friends
in the greater Portland area.

270
00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:41.580
And it's mostly a vehicle
for us to publish games

271
00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:45.090
that are actually designed by
people within the company. So

272
00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:47.340
we published our first game
havoc, the a hundred years

273
00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:49.110
war about a year and
a half ago. That was

274
00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:52.320
the designed by Casey Humphrey.
And this year we published

275
00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:55.890
a couple of games, one
called a 24 seven, which

276
00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:59.970
is a great math game
for, for families and kids.

277
00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:03.390
It's, it's very popular right
now that was published in

278
00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:06.810
October and just hot on
the shelves is a game

279
00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:10.650
called ink and gold, which
is our first published game

280
00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:14.280
by another designer. It's actually
designed by Alan Moon and Bruno

281
00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:16.650
fide duty. And Allen is
happens to be the designer

282
00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:18.420
of the ticket to ride
game that I just mentioned.

283
00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:20.850
And the 10 days in
Africa game that we played

284
00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:24.090
earlier, and that game is
a, it's a great big

285
00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:26.580
group game that has, it's
a pressure luck. I'm an

286
00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:29.880
Indiana Jones type character going
down into a, some Incan

287
00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:33.000
temples trying to get treasure.
And it's a great family

288
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.790
party game. Oh, that's cool.
That's amazing. It sounds like

289
00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:38.970
it's a very tight knit
community. I mean, you're my

290
00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:41.100
boss and you're my CTO
here at the company, but

291
00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:44.520
it seems like quite a
coincidence that, that your games

292
00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:47.340
are selling well, you're in
this deep into this kind

293
00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:50.040
of group. How many people
are out there producing games?

294
00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:52.730
I mean, you, you didn't
make up a game and

295
00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:55.070
then draw some things on
cardboard. I mean, I've seen

296
00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:58.040
these games, they're very professional.
It sounds like a great

297
00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:00.890
deal of thought. And work
goes into this, that take

298
00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:03.700
up a lot of time
and effort. It takes a

299
00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:06.550
lot of time and effort
from the key creative people

300
00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:10.570
in the company. I'm not
one of those. I'm more

301
00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:13.780
just the business guy that
keeps the books and makes

302
00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:16.180
decisions about maybe what we're
going to do and where

303
00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:18.910
we're going to focus. Cause
frankly, I just don't, I

304
00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:20.620
don't have the time I
have a day job. That's

305
00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:25.050
actually pretty consuming itself. So
yeah, the, I I'm, I'm,

306
00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:26.980
I'm blessed to have a
group of people that not

307
00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:30.100
only design games, but are
very skilled in graphical layout.

308
00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:32.650
We've done some of our
own artwork. We've used other

309
00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:35.050
artists as well for ink
and gold. We actually used

310
00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:37.930
a, an outside artist that
did all of the graphical

311
00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:40.570
design and, and, and artwork
in it. It is, it's

312
00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:43.510
a lot of work it's,
it is a, it's technically

313
00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:46.090
a hobby, not a business
because I think you have

314
00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:47.770
to make money doing it
for it to be called

315
00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:50.350
a business, but we're having
a lot of fun and

316
00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:52.480
it, it helps pay for
some conventions that we like

317
00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:54.710
to go to and meet
other people. And it's, it's

318
00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:58.600
a great way to get
some initial exposure for two

319
00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.400
people that I think are
just great designers within the

320
00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:03.520
company that could lead to
some bigger, bigger publishers picking

321
00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:06.250
them up. And you've played
these games. Some of the

322
00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:09.190
games you've mentioned Eli like
havoc. I played havoc and

323
00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:12.730
I've played ink and gold
and they're good. I really

324
00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:15.160
enjoy, I really enjoy having
it's. It's got kind of

325
00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.110
a poker flavor to it
with a little bit, a

326
00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:20.290
little bit of reclamation. I
really, really enjoyed that game.

327
00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:24.190
So we've talked about gateway
game. We've talked about places.

328
00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:26.890
People can go to learn
about gaming groups. I understand

329
00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:29.920
Chris that when you go
traveling, you often will hook

330
00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:32.650
up with whatever local group
is around town and play

331
00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:35.290
games. Might this be something
that people who listen to

332
00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:37.300
this podcast want to do?
Maybe if we're at tech

333
00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:40.360
ed, find a room somewhere
in between sessions and bring

334
00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:42.340
a couple of games and
put together a group it's

335
00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:44.920
probably already happening. Yeah. I
know for a fact it

336
00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:48.190
does happen at a lot
of technology conferences. If you

337
00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:50.560
look at the message boards,
as people are preparing to

338
00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:53.530
come down, you will often
see little groups getting together

339
00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:56.860
to maybe play settlers. If
you're traveling, if you travel

340
00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:59.500
a lot, I think board
game geek is a great

341
00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:03.190
reference. There's a Yahoo group
as well. That's a mailing

342
00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:06.460
list called spiel, freaks, spiel,
being the German word for

343
00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:10.000
games and, and, and just
play. That's a great place

344
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.980
to post. I, Hey, I'm
going to be in Birmingham,

345
00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:13.720
Alabama next week. Cause I
knew I want to get

346
00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:16.090
together and play games. I
joke with my wife and

347
00:17:16.090 --> 00:17:18.820
tell her that I have
an internet date next week

348
00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:21.910
in some random city. And
she's a little little concerned

349
00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:25.060
at times that I'm, I'm
sometimes meeting strangers, but these

350
00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:28.180
are generally people that are
friends of friends that you

351
00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:31.270
know, can be vouched for.
And they probably should feel

352
00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:33.460
more nervous taking a stranger
into their home than I

353
00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:37.450
should feel, but it's been
very fruitful. I've, I've managed

354
00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:39.070
to make a lot of
friends and meet a lot

355
00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:42.040
of interesting people doing that.
Well, this field, I feel

356
00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:43.810
like I have enough information
now that I'm going to

357
00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:45.970
go to the gaming place
after work and maybe pick

358
00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:48.250
up a couple of ways,
gateway games and see how

359
00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:50.460
it works for us. I
both of your guys' Time.

360
00:17:50.910 --> 00:18:01.170
No problem. Thanks. <inaudible>.
