From Hansel minutes.com it's Hanselman.
It's a weekly discussion with

9
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.170
web developer and technologist Scott
Hansel. This is Lawrence Ryan announced

10
00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.370
some show number 501. In
this episode, Scott talks with

11
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.440
VJ Shanker about speaking up
and improving your communication skills.

12
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.850
Hi, this is Scott Hanselman.
This is another episode of

13
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.850
Hanselminutes and today we're talking
with pore NEMA VJ Shanker

14
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.840
from Femgineer. How are you?
Great, thank you. I appreciate

15
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.740
you chatting with me today.
I I've looked all over

16
00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.700
your, your web presence and
you've got a really great,

17
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.320
really compelling YouTube channel. You've
got books and pamphlets and

18
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.880
information and accompany that all
seemed to be around empowerment.

19
00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.690
I would even say around
getting people to speak up.

20
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.940
Why is speaking up so
important As techies, whether we

21
00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.790
are technical or even a
I've seen this happen with

22
00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.620
marketers and product managers, people
get into this idea that

23
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.380
you just gotta be heads
down. You've got to crank

24
00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.940
through ship coach product, and
you'll get recognized for your

25
00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.040
efforts, but too often, that
doesn't happen. And it's not

26
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.520
even just about career advancement.
It's also about connecting with

27
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.660
customers. It's about letting people
know about your company, if

28
00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.780
you're a startup. And so
there's gotta be this balance

29
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.940
between the time that we
spend doing the technical work

30
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.780
and presenting ourselves in public.
What do we think that

31
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.400
heads down became such a
desirable or presume desirable thing

32
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.950
that culturally, when did that
start, that we were to

33
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.570
get your head down and
getting I'm really heads down

34
00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.550
on this project? Well, for
starters, it's gratifying at the

35
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.710
end of the day, you
can point to something and

36
00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:47.690
say, I built that, or
I fixed that. And that's

37
00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:48.860
what we want to feel
at the end of day,

38
00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.050
right? Want to feel like
we did something, we accomplished

39
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.320
something. And so it's very
easy to put a, put

40
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.350
your finger and point to
something that you accomplished. It's

41
00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.000
very hard to say. I
talked to customers or I

42
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.940
went out and gave this
talk at a conference because

43
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.170
you can't quantify what the
results are. And as techies,

44
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.570
we love to quantify things,
right? We'd love to get

45
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.300
things done and we'd love
to quantify things. And so

46
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.130
it's very hard for us
to not be headstone. You

47
00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.220
know, that you've like really
nailed, like, that's my job

48
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.700
right now. You know, like
before it was tests passes

49
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.730
and lines of code written,
but like after this, I'm

50
00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.130
going to go into downtown
Portland, I'm going to talk

51
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.290
at a conference, you know,
I'm going to, what do

52
00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.080
I say? You know, touch
the lives of 50 people.

53
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.450
And they all seem to
appreciate what I had to

54
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.490
say. Like, how do you
quantify that in a way

55
00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.560
that makes you feel like
your boss is not going

56
00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.310
to fire you? Yeah, you
don't. I mean, the purpose

57
00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.210
isn't to quantify the purpose
is to take a time

58
00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.230
out, to go out and
actually do some qualitative work,

59
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.820
meaning talking to customers, seeing
how they're reacting to your

60
00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.900
product, or going out and
spreading the word about your

61
00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.350
product, your company, whatever, and
seeing how people respond to

62
00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.860
it. And it's important to
have this balance between the

63
00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.400
qualitative and the quantitative and
to get that feedback. So

64
00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.550
it's not always about measuring,
but it is about taking

65
00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.580
a time out to, to
hear what other people think

66
00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:20.400
of our products and to,
and to make that one

67
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.370
on one connection. Is that
something that every engineer should

68
00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.060
do? I think on some
level, I think it comes

69
00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.260
down to, you know, what
their responsibilities are. You know,

70
00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.160
if you are an individual
contributor and your goal is

71
00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.070
to ship product, then it's
fair to say you would

72
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.060
set a goal of maybe
one talk a quarter, or

73
00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.450
at least one talk every
six months because you know,

74
00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:51.180
you're, you're definitely on the
assembly line versus your VP

75
00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.390
of engineering or your CTO.
Your job is to recruit,

76
00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:57.150
or at least one of
the main goals of your

77
00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.030
job is to recruit. So
it's important for you to

78
00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.900
be out there speaking and
spreading the word about your

79
00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.510
company. So it does come
down to, I think, job,

80
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.900
a job role or job
function, but that's not to

81
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.230
say that the engineer couldn't
speak as many times as

82
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.440
they would like, or the
CTO or VP of engineering.

83
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.600
Couldn't be writing some level
of code. But I think

84
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.650
it's important that everybody takes
the time out to do

85
00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.530
something as simple as speaking
up in a meeting or

86
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.200
doing a user group You're
you're advocating for people to

87
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.310
be real well-rounded yes. Do
you find that to be

88
00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.830
a challenge? Has that been
a challenge historically for you?

89
00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.670
I think for me, it
has not been a challenge.

90
00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:43.110
Whether or not it's been
rewarded is a different conversation.

91
00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.020
And I think that's where
a lot of people feel

92
00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.620
like, even though they may
be open to speaking up,

93
00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:52.680
whether it's in a meeting
or at a conference, they

94
00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.530
either feel like people are
going to see it as

95
00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:57.470
a waste of time. Like
you mentioned know, you can't

96
00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:00.950
quantify it, or they might
even be shot down. You

97
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:03.290
know, their ideas might not
be heard. So over time

98
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:07.310
they stopped doing it as
much. So, so we can

99
00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.340
kind of get into what
that means. But I think

100
00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:14.390
people generally initially want to,
to be well rounded, not

101
00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:16.730
everyone's like, Oh, I'm just
going to write code forever.

102
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:19.370
Right. They understand the importance
of talking to customers, getting

103
00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:22.400
feedback, talking to their teammates.
But I think over time

104
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.290
they start to become more
and more reclusive. Yeah. And

105
00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:28.510
I don't think anyone wants
to. I mean, there are

106
00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:32.200
people and I have been
on the use of the

107
00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:36.220
assembly line, no one like
aspires to the assembly line.

108
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.080
Right. They would like to
be a part of the

109
00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.900
larger machine and appreciated and
a valued member of the

110
00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.420
team. They recognize that you
have to put your heads

111
00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:45.700
down sometimes and crank out
some code, but I don't

112
00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:49.300
think anyone inspires to like
top out at the assembly

113
00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:53.950
line. Right. So speaking up
is, is extremely important. Do

114
00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:57.490
you think, is it important
because it, it feeds someone's

115
00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:59.410
spirit or is it important
because it is going to

116
00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:02.680
help their career? Why should
someone speak up? Why can't

117
00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:06.460
I just be quiet? Well,
I think it's, it's multifaceted.

118
00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:09.310
It's not just one thing.
Right? So I think the

119
00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:14.020
first is, regardless of what
we say, people need to

120
00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:17.230
be heard. Their ideas need
to be heard, whether it's

121
00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:19.630
a good idea or not,
you know, in a traditional

122
00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:23.380
brainstorming session, one of the
golden rules is everybody gets

123
00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:26.320
to chime in and ideas
will not be judged. Right.

124
00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:29.140
We save that for later
on when we're paring down,

125
00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:31.690
figuring out what's feasible, et
cetera. But in general, people

126
00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:34.240
need to feel like they're
heard. And the same thing

127
00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.300
happens in like a postmortem
session. And so I think

128
00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:40.690
in general, people need to
be heard by their teammates,

129
00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:45.940
as well as, you know,
upper level management. Otherwise they

130
00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:48.190
will start to feel like
that cog in the assembly

131
00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:51.340
line. So I think that's
the first, the second is

132
00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:55.930
it's also important for other
people to learn about you,

133
00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.090
you know, other, other folks
on the team, they need

134
00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:00.910
to understand how you make
decisions. They need to understand

135
00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:03.730
how you think. And a
lot of times when we

136
00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:06.640
don't speak up or we
hold back, then people don't

137
00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:10.180
even get to know about
who we are, where our

138
00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:13.480
interests might lie or where
our expertise might lie. So,

139
00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:16.900
so that's another way to
engage with, with our teammates.

140
00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:21.010
And then I think the
final part of this is,

141
00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:23.620
you know, certainly more of
the directed, like, Oh, we

142
00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:26.440
have certain things that we
need to communicate. Whether it's

143
00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:29.380
like deadlines or product features
or et cetera, those are

144
00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:32.170
more transactional, I would say.
So we have to get

145
00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:34.720
that out. But it's really
about the first two. It's

146
00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:37.900
about, you know, being heard
and people getting to know

147
00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:41.530
about us. And if those
things don't happen, then again,

148
00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:46.000
we tend to be more
reclusive. Someone told me once,

149
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.800
and I don't know what
I think about this statement,

150
00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:50.740
but it was an interesting
one that you teach people

151
00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:53.560
how to treat you. Now.
I think that there's, there's

152
00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:56.880
implicit biases. There are explicit.
There's all sorts of contexts,

153
00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:00.930
both historical and personal. That
leads someone to an interaction

154
00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:03.810
with someone else. But once
we're face to face like

155
00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:06.810
you and I are right
now, we're teaching each other

156
00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:10.350
how to treat each other,
whether it be through interruptions

157
00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:13.320
or eye contact or all
those things. Do you think

158
00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.480
that applies to engineers that
maybe are less likely to

159
00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:20.450
speak up? Definitely. So it's
important. Everybody set boundaries. And

160
00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:24.320
the only way you can
set boundaries is to actually

161
00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.780
explain what those boundaries are.
Right? So if you tell

162
00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:29.540
somebody I can't meet this
deadline, then the follow up

163
00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:33.050
question, hopefully the followup question
is, you know, why, what

164
00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:34.940
is it that's holding you
back? Are you stuck? Do

165
00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:37.880
you need to learn et
cetera? And hopefully that person

166
00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:41.030
on the receiving end is
asking those questions. So that's,

167
00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:44.210
that's great. But I think
the other, the other part

168
00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:47.990
is, you know, our teammates
are, our bosses are not

169
00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:52.040
mind readers and they don't
know if we're being overworked

170
00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:55.190
or if we are stuck.
So it's up to us

171
00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:58.160
to speak up. Now, mind
you, there are some toxic

172
00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.230
teams out there. I understand
where even if you say

173
00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:05.030
this, they won't recognize it,
but it's still your job

174
00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:08.810
to initiate. And if it's
not recognized, then you know,

175
00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:12.140
finding an environment where it
will be, right? Yeah. It

176
00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:14.900
is challenging. Sometimes when there
are interactions, you may not

177
00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:19.010
necessarily be responsible for a
bad interaction, but you're accountable

178
00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:21.500
for how you decide to
deal with that. Going forward.

179
00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:26.720
You have got a, your
company does online training and

180
00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:29.330
books and all sorts of
stuff. But you, one thing

181
00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:31.010
that you do that I
think is really interesting is

182
00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:33.650
you have a online training
that is on being a

183
00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:37.460
confident communicator. So this is
like a course that someone

184
00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:38.960
could take if they were
wanting to go out and

185
00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.300
become a public speaker and
do user groups or do

186
00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:45.500
big conferences. Exactly. Yeah. So
the goal of that course

187
00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:49.880
is to take you from
either you haven't done any

188
00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:53.300
speaking before, or you've done
some and you really want

189
00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:57.260
to do more, whether that's
internally at your company, you

190
00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.470
know, onboarding new employees or
customers, or you want to

191
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:02.440
be more public facing, you
want to get out there,

192
00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:05.870
be on the conference circuit
and you know, talking to

193
00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:08.570
talking to folks. So we
walk you through the core

194
00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:11.060
step by step to get
you to a point where

195
00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:15.350
at the end you have
developed a lightning talk, as

196
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:18.530
well as a long form,
talk around an area of

197
00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:20.870
expertise. Now you might not
know what your area of

198
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:23.780
expertise is coming in. And
that's okay. Because part of

199
00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:26.330
the course is to teach
you, a lot of folks

200
00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:29.240
have trouble with that. They
might've been coding for two

201
00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:32.210
years, 20 years have they
don't feel like they're an

202
00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:35.480
expert, but if I recall
one of your previous podcasts,

203
00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:38.930
you said, you know, you're
an enthusiastic amateur. And so

204
00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:40.970
our goal is to get
people to feel like an

205
00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:45.290
enthusiastic amateur and hopefully better
than that, but to figure

206
00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:48.740
out what that particular enthusiasm
is like, what the topic

207
00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:51.590
is that they want to
speak to. And it's okay.

208
00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:53.920
Like it's important to say
that out loud, it's for

209
00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:57.010
amateurs to talk about an
area that they are enthusiastic

210
00:11:57.010 --> 00:11:58.540
about. You don't have to
be an expert to give

211
00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:01.500
a talk on a topic.
Totally. And the reason is

212
00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:04.860
because, you know, when I
first graduated from college, I

213
00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:07.020
got invited to speak a
lot. And I was a

214
00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:08.550
little bit stunned because I
was like, ah, two years

215
00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:11.160
out of college. But a
lot of people said, well,

216
00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:14.430
we want you to come
because, and speak to college

217
00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:17.160
kids because they're just like
you. And they can see

218
00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:19.590
what life would be like
two years from now. If

219
00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:22.290
we brought in a CEO,
who's been in the industry

220
00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:24.180
for 20 years, they're going
to feel like, Oh my

221
00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:27.240
gosh, that's so far away.
How will I ever get

222
00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:30.750
there? And so it's important
to have people speaking at

223
00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:34.830
various stages, not just, you
know, fortune 500 CEOs, but

224
00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:37.860
even folks who are six
months, 12 months, or two

225
00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:41.700
years in to a project
or their careers. I think

226
00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:44.970
also that people look at
people. And I'm just, when

227
00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:47.310
I say people, I mean,
you all the listener, you

228
00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:50.100
maybe look at people who
give talks or known for

229
00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:52.560
giving talks and you see
that as some kind of

230
00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:57.180
a, a destination, but they
also think that there's one

231
00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:59.880
on one communication. And then
there's talking to 2000 people,

232
00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:03.090
but it really is a
gradient of communication skills. Isn't

233
00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:06.480
it? It is. And that's
actually one of the techniques

234
00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:10.080
that we cover pretty heavily
in our course. And in

235
00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:12.240
the end, in the upcoming
book as well, is this

236
00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:16.560
concept of getting comfortable, having
one on one conversations with

237
00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:19.920
your teammates, you know, your
boss, your peers, and then

238
00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:23.250
expanding to a, what I
call a mini audience. Maybe

239
00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:26.730
that's five people or 10
people could be a user

240
00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:29.880
group of 30 and then
going from there to maybe

241
00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:33.510
a hundred, a thousand, right.
Nobody goes from zero to

242
00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:38.640
10,000 overnight. And so it's
getting comfortable in those settings

243
00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:40.800
and that's really what helps
you get over your stage

244
00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:44.550
fright. But it's also what
helps you to understand what's

245
00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:47.780
resonating as your audience grows.
Yeah. I think it's important.

246
00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:51.540
Remember that an audience of
multiple people, it might be

247
00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:53.700
five people. It might be
the five important people who

248
00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:56.280
need to hear your message
at your job. It doesn't

249
00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:57.930
mean you necessarily need to
go and speak at the

250
00:13:57.930 --> 00:13:59.970
next big conference or you
even need to speak at

251
00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:03.510
a user group. Definitely. And,
and the, I would say

252
00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:08.400
the audience management is definitely
different between those two. I

253
00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:10.890
know a lot of people
I've actually spoken to who,

254
00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:13.620
who do the 50 or
500. I actually tell me

255
00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:15.270
that they get scared when
they have to present in

256
00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:18.720
front of five, because it
feels very intimate. They're sort

257
00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:20.940
of put on the spot.
It might be somebody like

258
00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:24.030
a decision maker in their
company. And so the stakes

259
00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:26.820
are higher than talking to
like 500 people in a

260
00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:29.400
big audience. You know, that,
that makes reminds me of

261
00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:32.790
a time. I was giving
a presentation to about 40

262
00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:35.550
people at a company I'd
never been to before. And

263
00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:39.780
it was not until the
very end when someone kind

264
00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:41.820
of left at the very,
very end. And then someone

265
00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:45.360
said that was the president
of the company. And frankly,

266
00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.790
I was glad they didn't
tell me beforehand because I

267
00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:50.160
would have given a different
talk. Like it would have

268
00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:53.270
had a different feeling. I
was very real and raw

269
00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:56.600
and it turns out they
appreciated that. But I didn't

270
00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:59.630
realize that in myself, I
would have, I would have

271
00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:02.510
torpedoed myself for lack of
a better word. If I

272
00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:04.550
had known that the founder
of the company was sitting,

273
00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:06.350
you know, I just thought
it was a random person.

274
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:09.290
You know, I assume you
can't assume things about your

275
00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:11.950
audience, Right. And that's okay.
I mean, you want to,

276
00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:15.790
you want people to feel
your almost authentic self. You

277
00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:18.850
don't want to be filtered
because if you do, then

278
00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:23.380
you just don't come off
as appealing. You know, audiences

279
00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:26.320
can sense when you're nervous,
but they can also sense

280
00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:30.520
when you're being disingenuous. And
you, you believe that the

281
00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:34.480
career doors open when people
get their communication skills tuned

282
00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:36.370
in, and this is a
skill that you learn, this,

283
00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:38.440
there are people who are
built to speak, but you

284
00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:41.320
really believe this can be
taught. It. Definitely. I actually

285
00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:45.580
have a pretty traditional background.
You know, I was definitely

286
00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:48.670
that shy kid who hid
behind my mother's skirt for

287
00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:52.920
a long time. And it
wasn't until, you know, I

288
00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:56.530
wanted to be a lawyer
obviously decided against that career

289
00:15:56.530 --> 00:15:58.810
path. But when I found
out, or at least when

290
00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:00.190
I decided I wanted to
be a lawyer, I knew,

291
00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:01.780
okay, I've got to suck
it up and I've got

292
00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:05.140
to start taking public speaking
courses. So yes, I was

293
00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:08.490
that a high school debate
nerd and went through and

294
00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:12.070
learned all the mechanics behind
public speaking. So it's definitely

295
00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:15.010
a skill that can be
taught. And it's also a

296
00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:17.620
skill that you've got to
hone over time. You know,

297
00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:19.570
the way I spoke in
debate is not how I

298
00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:22.750
would get up and present
today if I was presenting

299
00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:25.420
in front of customers or
if I was speaking to

300
00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:29.260
college students. And so that
too is important than evolves

301
00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:33.100
over time. So you have
the confident communicator course. And

302
00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:36.520
then just now in November,
the present, that's the name

303
00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:38.560
of the book present the
techies guide to engaging an

304
00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:42.730
audience book that's available now
as well in, in both

305
00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:44.830
of these courses, I assume
that the course came first

306
00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:47.380
and then the book came
out of the course. Yes.

307
00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:49.600
So the course is actually
much more in depth. You

308
00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:52.240
know, we go into some
advanced topics, we go into

309
00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:55.090
topics like how to get
paid, to speak if that's

310
00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:59.140
of interest to you, as
well as some other scenarios.

311
00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:01.450
And, and the, and the
reason that we do it

312
00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:04.780
in the course is it
gives us the ability to

313
00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:08.050
be more hands on with
our students. The, the goal

314
00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:11.740
of the book is to
get you comfortable giving maybe

315
00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:15.040
that first talk, or if
you have given your first

316
00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:17.650
talk and you felt like
it wasn't polished, or you

317
00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:20.140
didn't engage with the audience
enough, then giving you some

318
00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:24.370
more step by step guidance
to improving it. So the

319
00:17:24.370 --> 00:17:27.310
book is definitely more of
a primer and the course

320
00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:31.210
gets into more advanced topics.
And in the book, you

321
00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:33.640
talk about small groups as
well as go moving up

322
00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:37.480
to larger. Yep. Yep. Each,
each chapter basically is broken

323
00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:39.700
down. So, you know, we're
starting with some of the

324
00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:42.460
basics around, how do you
comp with your topic? How

325
00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:45.760
do you test a topic
in front of a really

326
00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:49.530
small group, maybe it's a
peer or your team, and

327
00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:53.130
then going from there to
creating a short outline to

328
00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:55.770
practice from, you know, how
to then go and speak

329
00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:58.590
to a initial set of
people and then grow your

330
00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:02.490
audience from there. So we're
walking you through step by

331
00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:04.620
step to get you to
a point at the end

332
00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:08.190
of the book where you
have that final talk. And

333
00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:10.650
there are exercises in the
book to guide you through

334
00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:13.010
that entire process. So at
the point that you are

335
00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:15.200
now, you said that on
the way from high school

336
00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:18.620
up until now, you went
through the high school debate

337
00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:22.250
direction. Now I went through
drama. So I was actually

338
00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:24.980
like, people don't realize I
actually lettered in drama. So

339
00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:28.370
I have a high school
Letterman's jacket that people assume

340
00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:31.070
means I have some ability
at sports. It didn't in

341
00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:34.010
fact means nothing of the
sort I let in drama.

342
00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:37.460
Have you noticed any difference
between the kinds of skills

343
00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:40.250
that were developed in a
dramatic or in an onstage

344
00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:42.500
kind of a sense versus
doing debate or are they

345
00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:47.550
the same thing? Well, debate
is very aggressive, right? Your,

346
00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:50.630
your whole goal during that,
you know, hour or however

347
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:54.470
long a session is, is
to come off super confident.

348
00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:57.830
And you're almost talking at
people the majority of the

349
00:18:57.830 --> 00:19:01.010
time, you know, there's some,
there's some level of, of

350
00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:03.860
softening, but, but in general,
you know, I would say

351
00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:06.890
it can be very aggressive.
The type of speaking I

352
00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:10.040
do now is not at
all aggressive, right? It is

353
00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:14.180
more inspirational. It's about empowering
and it's about educating people.

354
00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:16.250
And when you do it
in that kind of context,

355
00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:19.640
you have to be very,
very careful about who your

356
00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:23.270
audience is. What's going to
resonate with them. If you're

357
00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:28.100
showcasing a process or something
you it's repeatable, and they

358
00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:31.160
can go out and, and
repeat that. So, so it's

359
00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:35.720
very, very different. It probably
mirrors more of an oratory,

360
00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:39.380
you know, TEDx style sort
of speaking. So I did

361
00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:43.430
have to learn a new
style. And I also had

362
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:47.930
to learn how to identify
my audience because before the

363
00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:50.270
audience was very much the
same, you know, was other

364
00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:53.660
high school debaters. And then
the judges who were previous

365
00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:56.600
high school debaters or college
debaters. And so it was

366
00:19:56.600 --> 00:20:00.800
very, I would say limited
in terms of its diversity.

367
00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:04.070
Whereas now, you know, I
am going to be talking

368
00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:09.590
to investors, customers, students, et
cetera. And so I've got

369
00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:13.370
to be more comfortable changing
my style up as well

370
00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:16.370
as changing my messaging. I
sometimes look at it as

371
00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:19.440
putting on different suits and
which is funny, cause I

372
00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:21.680
don't really have any suits,
but there's, you know, there's

373
00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:24.440
the talking to investors suit.
There's talking to, you know,

374
00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:27.200
old bankers suit versus the
talking to a bunch of

375
00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:30.470
young kids. Certainly you would
teach high school kids very

376
00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:35.120
differently than you would teach
adults an engineering topic. It

377
00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:38.030
seems to me when people
initially get started speaking, they

378
00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:40.970
don't really differentiate as much.
They just go out and

379
00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:44.000
they do whatever their default
is. It seems like people

380
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.030
really should think about their
audience and put a, put

381
00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:50.490
the correct suit on for
that audience. Yeah. I mean,

382
00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:53.340
you know, as techies, we're
used to building products, right?

383
00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:54.750
And what's the first thing
that we do when we're

384
00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:57.450
building a product, we think
about who's our user, what's

385
00:20:57.450 --> 00:21:00.090
the experience we want to
give them a talk is

386
00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:03.120
no different. You know, the
only thing that's different is

387
00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:07.290
instead of developing a product,
we're developing some content, but

388
00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:09.420
the mechanics are still the
same. So we need to

389
00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:12.360
think through who the audience
is going to be. What

390
00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:14.910
are some of the problems
or pain points they might

391
00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:18.540
experience? What are some questions
that might come up during

392
00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:20.880
a Q and a, and
a lot of times, if

393
00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:24.510
the audience mirrors who we
might have been when we're

394
00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:27.900
like conveying the experience, then
that's great, but there might

395
00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:30.780
be more, right? So there's
even things that I recommend,

396
00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:34.170
like testing out. What kinds
of questions people might ask

397
00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:39.150
given the topic so that
you don't feel blindsided during

398
00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:42.360
a Q and a session.
But I think a lot

399
00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:46.230
of the parallels exist between
building a product as well

400
00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:49.110
as building a talk. And
that's important to keep in

401
00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:52.530
mind. You think that people
sometimes put so much work

402
00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:55.320
into their products and they
don't, they don't put as

403
00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:57.060
much work into a talk,
but the talk is a

404
00:21:57.060 --> 00:22:00.270
product in itself. Why aren't
we doing AB testing and

405
00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:02.220
trying it out with different
people upfront? You know, you

406
00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:05.730
can't just roll in and
start talking. Right. Well, it

407
00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:10.950
depends. Some people, I think
it's giving a talk for

408
00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:13.110
some people is like, Oh,
my boss came in and

409
00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:15.030
said, I have to do
this presentation. So I'm going

410
00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:17.010
to whip something up and
put it out there. Right.

411
00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:21.030
Or a lot of times
they're communicating some information that's

412
00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:23.880
been passed down to them.
It's not always their own

413
00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:27.060
experience. You see this a
lot with marketers and sales

414
00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:30.030
folks. But if when you,
when you take a look

415
00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:33.270
at a content, I think
you do want to take

416
00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:35.130
the time to take a
step back and ask the

417
00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:38.160
question, you know, how is
this gonna impact the person

418
00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:42.900
listening? The other reason I
think people fail to do

419
00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:45.600
this, or they don't necessarily
think about it is because

420
00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:50.310
they're just regurgitating an experience
rather than thinking about it

421
00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:53.790
through the lens of, okay,
I'm going to presenting to

422
00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:57.150
a brand new engineer, who's
learning Python for the first

423
00:22:57.150 --> 00:23:00.720
time. What was my experience?
Like what might they experience?

424
00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:03.840
What might be some points
that they might get stuck?

425
00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:06.960
Right. So we don't necessarily
take the time instead. We're

426
00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:10.020
like, Oh, I had this
amazing experience learning the Django

427
00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:11.760
framework. And now I'm going
to tell you all about

428
00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:15.810
it. And that can be
very one sided. People still

429
00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:18.960
want to hear that. But
again, you've got it crafted

430
00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:21.300
in a way that's going
to be beneficial to them.

431
00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:24.420
Yeah. I think empathy is
what I'm hearing. You say,

432
00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:29.340
really seeing it from their
perspective and, and putting yourself

433
00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:32.640
in their shoes. And, and
like you said, AB testing

434
00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:34.380
for talks is great. I
think a lot of times

435
00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:36.810
people do a talk and
then they're like, okay, well

436
00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:39.600
that was done. It's totally
okay to give the same

437
00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:43.380
talk multiple times to refine
it, to take feedback from

438
00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:45.950
your audience and then figure
out what some holes might

439
00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:48.710
be. But the goal isn't
to just create a new

440
00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:52.420
talk every single time. Yeah,
definitely. I've got, I've got

441
00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:54.670
very kind of dry educational
talks that I do, but

442
00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:56.290
I've also got one that
I've been doing lately, which

443
00:23:56.290 --> 00:24:00.430
is a very light fun.
I call it edutainment. I've

444
00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:02.560
probably done it like eight
or nine times. Probably. There

445
00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:04.660
are some people who are
sick of seeing it, but

446
00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:07.570
like any good speech. I
swear, it's getting better each

447
00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:10.240
time. You know, I'm, I'm
getting to practice it on

448
00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:13.030
people at conferences. And even
those people who might have

449
00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:16.420
heard it before, I would
be surprised if they didn't

450
00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:20.140
learn something new the next
time. Cause there's always times

451
00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:22.300
where I go and see
somebody speak and I maybe

452
00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:26.020
get 50%. I'm lucky if
I get 75%, like as

453
00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:28.720
in retain it. So I
typically ask them like, Hey,

454
00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:31.360
if this was broadcast or
there's a recording of it,

455
00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:34.390
can I check it out
again? Especially if there was

456
00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:36.550
some sort of process involved,
cause I want to go

457
00:24:36.550 --> 00:24:39.100
back and revisit what they
covered. I'm not going to

458
00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:42.010
sit there and scratch down
notes the whole time I

459
00:24:42.010 --> 00:24:44.860
want to be engaged. Well,
this is actually a perfect

460
00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:48.700
time to pivot and talk
about something else. You did

461
00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:51.850
a talk at a TEDx
talk that was called taking

462
00:24:51.850 --> 00:24:55.330
the time to tinker. And
that, that really resonated with

463
00:24:55.330 --> 00:24:58.990
me. I think sometimes we
get so focused on building

464
00:24:58.990 --> 00:25:02.260
product and making money and
founding this and engineering that,

465
00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:04.540
that we forget that just
trying to get an led

466
00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:06.700
to light up can be
a very inspirational kind of

467
00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:08.470
an experience. Can you talk
to me about why it's

468
00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:11.980
important to tinker? Yeah, well,
you know, I did that

469
00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:17.470
talk because I was appealing
to two audiences, one, a

470
00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:20.560
group of people who may
be a little bit afraid

471
00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:23.290
of technology, you know, they
could be people who are

472
00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:27.460
young or mid career or,
you know, just in a

473
00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:31.630
completely different industry, but I
wanted to get people more

474
00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:35.500
accustomed to playing with technology
and being comfortable with breaking

475
00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:39.610
things and really taking it
through a lens of a

476
00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:42.190
child. You know, a child
doesn't really care if they

477
00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:44.920
break things unless they get
yelled at. So as an

478
00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:46.690
adult, you know, hopefully, no
one's gonna yell at you

479
00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:48.970
if you're doing this as
a side project. Right. So

480
00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:52.840
getting people more comfortable with
that. And then to your

481
00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:57.250
point, actually, to discovering other
areas, like I think a

482
00:25:57.250 --> 00:26:00.190
lot of times people get
very stuck in I'm a

483
00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:03.970
rails developer or I'm a
marketer and they don't take

484
00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:06.550
the time to maybe go
out and learn a new

485
00:26:06.550 --> 00:26:09.010
skill. It doesn't mean that
the marketer has to become

486
00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:11.260
an engineer or the engineer
has to become the marketer,

487
00:26:11.710 --> 00:26:15.850
but just kind of getting
to know another discipline, one

488
00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:18.550
to help with empathy. Right.
Understand who else is on

489
00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:22.030
your team, but two to
also just get a different

490
00:26:22.030 --> 00:26:27.010
viewpoint and see how that
impacts your creativity longterm. So

491
00:26:27.010 --> 00:26:30.580
I think that's, that's important,
but yeah, there's not enough

492
00:26:30.610 --> 00:26:35.290
time. I know in people's
day jobs to take to

493
00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:38.980
tinker. So telling them to
work slowly, you know, it

494
00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:41.620
can be maybe just a
small project they do once

495
00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:44.190
and then that's it, or
even an hour a day,

496
00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:45.480
or even if it's on
an hour, a day, an

497
00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:48.120
hour, a month or once
a quarter. Right. Just a

498
00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:50.810
little bit goes a long
way. Yeah. I think kind

499
00:26:50.810 --> 00:26:53.690
of tying the two threads
between getting out of your

500
00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:56.630
comfort zone and giving presentations
and getting out of your

501
00:26:56.630 --> 00:27:00.290
comfort zone and tinkering, it
can be really challenging because

502
00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:03.710
someone might do their first
speech and discover that they're

503
00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:06.530
not a natural, right. Just
as I tried to solder

504
00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:10.280
some wires together and discovered,
apparently I'm not a natural

505
00:27:10.550 --> 00:27:13.610
at soldering, it can be
really overwhelming to learn that

506
00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:15.800
I'm not awesome at everything.
You know what I mean?

507
00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:18.050
If I can consistently, I'm
not awesome at a lot

508
00:27:18.050 --> 00:27:20.750
of things, but it's still
important. Yeah. I don't, I

509
00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:24.110
mean, I can't think of
anything. I remember being when

510
00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:27.950
I was a kid and,
and thinking, Oh my, my

511
00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:32.300
first talk w it was
horrible. It wasn't even about

512
00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:34.790
a stage fright. It was
more just like the content

513
00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:37.340
was bad. The presentation was
bad. Didn't have a lot

514
00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:40.640
of logical flow. And getting
back that initial set of

515
00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:46.610
commentary was very disheartening but
necessary. And I think in

516
00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:49.310
that learning phase, you have
to get comfortable with that,

517
00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:51.710
but you've got to take
that first step. So I'm

518
00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:54.740
definitely more of the camp
of, I don't know if

519
00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:57.470
anything has come naturally to
me, I know there are

520
00:27:57.470 --> 00:27:59.450
some people who are, are
great, you know, they'll pick

521
00:27:59.450 --> 00:28:02.930
up something and start to
work wonders. But I think

522
00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:05.360
for the vast majority of
us out there, we definitely

523
00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:08.390
are more of a learn
by doing and refining over

524
00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:10.790
time. You know, I think
that is a really, really

525
00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:14.720
valuable thing to remember that
it, it may come naturally

526
00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:16.490
to someone, but that just
gets them up to a

527
00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:20.090
certain point. It's simply a
jumpstart, you know, Serena Williams

528
00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:24.230
did not have instant success
as a tennis player. Right.

529
00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:26.750
She had a natural ability,
but it's the hard work

530
00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:30.110
really? That, that made it
happen. Definitely. Yeah. That, that

531
00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:33.710
will compliment sort of your
natural talents or your natural

532
00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:37.970
interests. But yeah, you've got
to have both. Absolutely. Now

533
00:28:37.970 --> 00:28:41.900
you are a, an engineer
that worked at mint, as

534
00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:43.520
I understand that was, she
was at your first place

535
00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:46.370
that you worked. It's my
second. That was my first

536
00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:48.980
startup, but it was my
second job out of college.

537
00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:51.950
And you have a double
major in both electrical engineering

538
00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:55.220
and computer science. Correct. And
while you were at mint,

539
00:28:55.550 --> 00:28:57.050
is it true that you
were the only woman on

540
00:28:57.050 --> 00:28:59.810
the staff with the early
startup times? Yes, I, I

541
00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:03.200
was, well, I was the
only woman engineer. We did

542
00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:07.340
have some other women in
business functions, like the marketing

543
00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:11.420
office, chief marketing officer and
in business development. So there

544
00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:13.700
were other women on the
team, but I was the

545
00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:17.990
sole female engineer. And was
it that, that fact that

546
00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:21.830
it caused you to start
Femgineer? So at the time

547
00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:24.230
this was back in 2007,
I wanted to get back

548
00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:28.430
into writing and a couple
friends of mine who were

549
00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:31.700
working at the company definitely
encouraged me to start blogging.

550
00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:33.530
They're like, Oh, that's what
all the cool kids are

551
00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:36.290
doing. So I thought, okay,
why not? And I, you

552
00:29:36.290 --> 00:29:38.690
know, you always get into
this conundrum of like what

553
00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:42.370
to call a blog or
what to call a, and

554
00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:46.900
certainly porny my reader, shanker.com
was going to be ridiculous,

555
00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:50.020
right. Just to search, to,
to type in, I, I

556
00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:52.540
knew it would be. And
I just thought about, what

557
00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:54.040
do I want to talk
about? Well, I really want

558
00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:58.150
to talk about being an
engineer, being in startups, building

559
00:29:58.150 --> 00:30:01.570
products. And since I just,
you know, identified as like,

560
00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:04.810
Hey, I'm female and engineer,
why not call it? Femgineer,

561
00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:08.640
that's how the name came
out of it. And it

562
00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:11.080
kind of stuck to the
theme of what I was

563
00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:13.530
working on at the time.
Very cool. I, now it

564
00:30:13.530 --> 00:30:15.840
is an education company and
you have a partner and

565
00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:18.570
you're creating content and classes
and all sorts of stuff.

566
00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:23.580
Exactly. That's fantastic. So your
book present, I'll put again,

567
00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:25.340
a link in the show
notes, but it's up, you

568
00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:29.880
can see it at femgineer.com/present.
Dash book is out now

569
00:30:29.910 --> 00:30:31.620
and a, can people get
it on Amazon as well?

570
00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:34.950
Yeah, I think it'll probably
be another month before it's

571
00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:38.220
out an Amazon, but they
can definitely get it on

572
00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:41.010
the, the site that you
mentioned. Very cool. There's a

573
00:30:41.010 --> 00:30:43.020
lot of great resources and
I would really encourage people

574
00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:45.350
by the way, just a
compliment to you and a

575
00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:48.360
direction to the listener. Your
YouTube channel is really great.

576
00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:50.550
There's a lot of really
good advice on your channel

577
00:30:50.550 --> 00:30:53.640
and it's very professionally done.
Thank you. Thank you so

578
00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:56.790
much for chatting with me
today. You're welcome. This has

579
00:30:56.790 --> 00:30:59.430
been another episode of Hanselminutes
and we'll see you again

580
00:30:59.430 --> 00:30:59.940
next week.
