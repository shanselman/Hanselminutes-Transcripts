magazine online at www dot
<inaudible> dot com. In this

11
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.550
episode, we continue with Scott
pre-sells discussing the past and

12
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:24.000
future of programming. There are
so many, there's so much

13
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.270
existing functionality in my box.
If I had some way

14
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.330
to list all of the
DLL calls I could make

15
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.170
and all of the dark
CS I could call the

16
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.080
command line arguments and, and
all of the calm objects

17
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.200
and all of the.net classes
and big surface area, it's

18
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.050
a huge surface area. And
so if I'm going to

19
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.860
navigate that surface area, I
want some help. And the

20
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.800
help, the thing I do
is I go, well, I'm

21
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.300
going to, I think in
system dot networking is something.

22
00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.060
I want a system that
networking dot, Oh, wait, here's

23
00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.150
the thing. And that's how
I learned. Actually, there's so

24
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.070
much functionality. Now, the one
thing that I have to

25
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.410
do is whenever I find
that function, I think I've

26
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.630
found that discovered that function.
I have to go see

27
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.420
if it's obsolete now. Oh,
we'll see. That's the beauty

28
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.640
of that net. It'll tell
you. Yeah, I will. Although

29
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.700
I have to say load
with partial name is the

30
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.300
most used a function called
this Mark obsolete that I've

31
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.520
ever seen. Well, I got
the whole game. That's a

32
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.990
whole other talk. We should
do a whole talk about

33
00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.000
the loader sometime. I mean
the whole load from load

34
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.150
file, you know, it's like
at 90% of every little

35
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.900
bit of a plugin code,
I find scattered around the

36
00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.190
bathroom wall of code. That
is the internet. Everyone is

37
00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.670
calling assembly that load from,
and I just want to

38
00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.640
go well and that's not
their fault. I mean, it's

39
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.350
our fault. It's just send
it out load from his

40
00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.800
fault. The fault is that
that net really doesn't have

41
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.450
a decent plugin technology, right?
This idea provider model wasn't

42
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.840
built in from the very
much and unlike comm, which

43
00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.020
has a wonderful one really
does. That was one of

44
00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.730
the things I say that
we lost when we went

45
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.030
from calm to.net. And I
just sprayed just putting it

46
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:11.410
back. It's just, we haven't
yet someday pop. Okay. So

47
00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:17.660
I would say that IntelliSense
was huge for me. What

48
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.810
happened after intelligence? So that,
so you're saying that the

49
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.810
last 15 years, the only
really interesting programming thing that

50
00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.620
happened was visual programming and
intelligence. No, no. We're just

51
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.830
three in the list. We're
also a half an hour

52
00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.540
into our pod. Well, that's
because poor wordy bastards. What

53
00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.540
do you want? We are
wordy. So if you just

54
00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.880
listen to the first five
minutes and then fast forward

55
00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.140
to 30 minutes, Okay. We
still got to tell us

56
00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.310
since you've got visual design
and of course calm was

57
00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.200
the first thing by an
Eric, the concept of a

58
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.230
component model. Right. And so,
so I would say, so

59
00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.660
I came up with comm,
you came up with visual

60
00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.830
programming. I came up with
IntelliSense, it's your term list?

61
00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.070
Yeah, that happened in the
last 15 years. So I

62
00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:07.740
know I got nothing really,
so much stuff happened before

63
00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.010
that though, that I'm thinking
to my I'm thinking garbage

64
00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.410
collection. I don't know. Dynamic
type. No. Well, I would

65
00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.400
absolutely say in the last
15 years, obviously not garbage

66
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.380
collection, but the popularization of
garbage collection, the popularization of

67
00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.120
garbage, the reread popularization of
dynamic typing and dynamic languages.

68
00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.400
Yeah. I don't know. I
go back and forth on

69
00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.630
that one. I mean, it
seems like with dynamic languages,

70
00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.570
I want some of the
capabilities, right. I want to

71
00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.530
be able to, to have
a reflection mechanism, to find

72
00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.600
out what I've got and
to do different things with

73
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.670
it. Right. And I want
to be able to walk

74
00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:48.630
up to instances and add
data and behavior to them.

75
00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.630
Right. I want, and we
want method, method missing, you

76
00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.940
know, I guess you call
them static methods. Now in

77
00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.910
method missing method missing is
in Ruby. I can go

78
00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.350
and I have a person
and I could say person

79
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.190
dot bark and person would
not have a bark, but

80
00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.590
I could go and make
a thing called method missing,

81
00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.860
which is the function that
would get called whenever I

82
00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.610
call a function that's missing.
Nice. And then I could

83
00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.340
then have person have bark
so I can get the

84
00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.670
person class from you, Chris,
and then call a person

85
00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.090
and bark on it and,
and spot weld onto the

86
00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.640
side of it. The new
method. Yeah. So that, that,

87
00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.850
that has become amongst those
kinds of walks, that method

88
00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.400
missing style programming is the
same kind of thing that

89
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.580
they do in PowerShell with
a script properties and a

90
00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.910
script methods where you go
into your power shell XNL

91
00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:43.530
file and you add methods
that don't already exist. So

92
00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:46.230
for example, I've always felt
that the string class should

93
00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:50.880
have a two basically Forrest
string and from basics. Now

94
00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.340
I could derive one and
then make a, I don't

95
00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.130
think you can, I believe
the StringClasses seals. Oh yeah,

96
00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.220
you're right. But you know
what? I'm, I don't like

97
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.680
functionality in this food class.
I'm going to derive one.

98
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:04.940
So you're familiar with <inaudible>
extension methods static, but that

99
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.900
was a mistake extension. The
syntax is like a big,

100
00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:12.890
a big static thing, but
it's like method missing is

101
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:15.770
extension methods in an eye
dispatching kind of a, yeah.

102
00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:21.980
It's adding functionality at, so
obviously what did I just

103
00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.410
call them extension methods or
adding it at compile time.

104
00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:29.210
And that's a wonderful feature
and, you know, message method

105
00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:32.280
missing right. Is a way
to do it at all.

106
00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.550
And I want both, and
it's all the Oop purists

107
00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:38.180
though, you know, the followers
of the ThoughtWorks crowd. They're

108
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.430
like, Oh, that's not, that's
not good. You can't, how

109
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:42.620
do you reconcile that? It's
just like the whole argument

110
00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:46.130
that happened when C-sharp, didn't
include multiple inheritance. You know

111
00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:47.570
what I mean? There was
a sign of little kind

112
00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:50.660
of actually I know Jake
in the street when that

113
00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:52.220
happened. Well, you know, but
there was like a mini

114
00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:54.710
uprising, like, but what if,
what about this obscure edge

115
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:57.410
case, you know, I'm just
run into it and lightweight.

116
00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:59.330
Yeah. But then you work
around it with interfaces or

117
00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:03.290
whatever. I would say that
one of the things that

118
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:08.420
we've got as programmers in
the last 15 years is

119
00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:13.760
the solidification of objects as
a way. Right. I would

120
00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:17.240
say that there's no other
way. No, no, I wouldn't

121
00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.400
say that. It's true at
all. I mean, you know,

122
00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.110
there's a bunch of other
ways we've been, for example,

123
00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:23.960
we've, we've been, there are
other ways, but for the

124
00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.780
business programmer, are they gonna
pick Haskell as the thing

125
00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:32.060
they're going to bet this
is just, well, sure. Yeah.

126
00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:34.220
That's interesting. I can have,
we can have a whole

127
00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.050
other talk on that too.
We'll do that next week.

128
00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:41.720
Okay. But I would say
that just, just the pervasiveness

129
00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:45.110
of objects as a way
of thinking about how to

130
00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:47.360
program, you know, what all
the way through the tools

131
00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.940
that the buggers and just
everything, you know, what solidified

132
00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:53.270
that for me was I
put my head down somewhere

133
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:57.470
around 2003, and then I
brought it up in 2007

134
00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:00.830
and realized that while I
was asleep, people had turned

135
00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:05.330
JavaScript into a complete object
oriented universe and had built

136
00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:09.930
whole object models to reflect
reality. And it built well,

137
00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:11.360
when I, when I had
my head down, it was

138
00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:14.360
methods instructs. Yup. And when
I lifted my head up,

139
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:17.330
it was a whole programming
language. And then Jeff Atwood

140
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:21.440
at coding horror has declared
the browser, the new IDE,

141
00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:24.170
Oh my Lord. Yeah. I
mean, you put Firebug or

142
00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:28.040
web developer toolbar or internet
developer, you know, III developer,

143
00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:31.370
toolbar. And suddenly he spends
90% of his time developing

144
00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:36.350
in the browser. Wow. Well,
cause he's using browser plugins

145
00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:40.610
that have pains, then let
him, so he said the

146
00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:42.710
browser is the new idea.
Of course the whole thing

147
00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:44.900
is all dynamic. Right. So
as he makes it, it's,

148
00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:46.790
it's all real, you can
see it and interact with

149
00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:49.760
it. I do almost all
of my editing and style

150
00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:53.420
sheet work in my blog
using the web developer toolbar.

151
00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:57.060
And as I type the
CSS, the page just dynamically

152
00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:00.620
updates. Wow. Wow. So, so
I think that's actually a

153
00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:03.680
good segue into what the
future programming was going to.

154
00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:08.780
Right. Because I think that,
you know, just the idea

155
00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:11.450
of the designer as what
you see is what you

156
00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:15.580
get for, for visuals. I
think we're going to, and

157
00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:19.760
then the whole kind of,
that's really a graphic user

158
00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:23.390
interface around this whole idea
of, I want to tell

159
00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:25.850
the computer what I want
and then let it do

160
00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:28.190
it right. Under declarative model.
Right, Right, right. But also

161
00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:32.180
the separation before there was
this artificial and uncomfortable separation

162
00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:38.000
between design view and runtime
view, asp.net, that, that team,

163
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.670
I think got bit by
that more than anyone because

164
00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:43.640
they built in this notion
of we're going to instantiate

165
00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:45.950
your page and the designer,
and we're not really going

166
00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:48.050
to give it a real
to be context. So it's

167
00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:51.260
not really happening. Right. And
then you had this situation

168
00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.080
where it looked one way
and design view another now

169
00:09:54.740 --> 00:10:01.430
with kind of increased dynamicism
Dynamism, dynamism Within these environments.

170
00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:03.860
I think the expectation is
that what I'm looking at,

171
00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:06.380
whether it be in design
view or one time is

172
00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:08.690
the real view. And I
think Sam will probably be

173
00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:13.190
a good example. Absolutely. Absolutely.
And, and we're seeing that

174
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:17.930
a lot in, in UI
is absolutely. And we have

175
00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:20.600
for awhile ever since visual
basic one it's been there.

176
00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:24.260
But I would say that
we also are getting that

177
00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:29.540
when it comes to even
behavior and data. For example,

178
00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:32.750
if you would imagine, look
at Excel, I'd probably start

179
00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:35.120
up Excel three to five
times a day and write

180
00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:37.580
an app. Right. I typed
in some numbers, I put

181
00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:41.360
some relationships between those numbers.
I'd get my results and

182
00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:43.550
you know, four times out
of five, I throw it

183
00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:45.740
away. I've got my results.
I'd run my program. I'm

184
00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:48.050
done. Right. So it's, it's,
it's electric paper for you.

185
00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:50.630
All right. And you know,
one time out of five,

186
00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:53.240
I'll probably save it, come
back and build up with

187
00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:56.360
new data. And to the,
Here's a thought, wouldn't it

188
00:10:56.360 --> 00:11:00.860
be nice if Excel word
PowerPoint? And one note, I

189
00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:03.140
was thinking more specifically of
Excel in one note, really

190
00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:06.800
the same application. And you
might remember, you know, and

191
00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:09.950
then think about tablets, tablet,
PCs, and the sense of,

192
00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:11.450
if I write a bunch
of numbers and put a

193
00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:14.630
line underneath the bottom, you
should, you should some that,

194
00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:16.970
and there were a lot
of tablet applications that did

195
00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:19.460
that kind of stuff For
physics. There was the physical

196
00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:22.490
illustration, Which is amazing. If
you haven't tried this, do

197
00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:24.290
you have a tablet PC,
or you have a Wacom

198
00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:28.130
tablet go and Google for
the physics illustrator, you literally

199
00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:33.080
Draw balls, draw Line describing
how gravity works. I've seen

200
00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:36.500
this and just say, yes,
amazing unreal. And then didn't,

201
00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:39.050
they have one too for
like mathematical applications where you

202
00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:41.750
could like, just write down
an equation that would figure

203
00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:43.790
it out, figure it out.
Wow. At that, I mean,

204
00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:47.570
electric paper is a place
that we're going actually getting

205
00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:50.870
into a little bit to
use your experience. I got,

206
00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:54.130
I got my F well,
it's kind of embarrassing. I

207
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:56.020
talked about it on my
blog, but a friend of

208
00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:59.620
mine loaned me his copy
of dance, dance revolution, which

209
00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:02.110
is something you really need
to close the, the shades.

210
00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:03.420
If you know what I'm
saying, I want to know

211
00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:06.690
if this is more or
less embarrassing than your predilection

212
00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:10.350
for runway fashion models, Fashion,
Eastville, and a well dressed

213
00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:12.510
one at that. And I'm
not ashamed. Well, I have

214
00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:14.490
to say, as we're sitting
here in my office, I've

215
00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:18.450
got my, my loose button
up shirt on and my,

216
00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:20.880
you know, my baggy jeans
and Scott sitting here a

217
00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:23.520
pair of $200 shoes on,
he does, he's sitting here

218
00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:26.070
with it. I, you know,
my sleeves are rolled up.

219
00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:29.610
Scott's got, it has to
be a freshly pressed shirt

220
00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:33.000
on Scott. I mean, you're
looking styling and you know,

221
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.340
he's got the watch. And
of course the sleeves are,

222
00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:37.530
you know, buttoned at the
cuffs and he's sitting there,

223
00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:40.860
I'm just sitting sprawled out
on my recliner. Scott's got

224
00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:43.920
his leg up and you
know, he's every once in

225
00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:47.070
a while he smooth clothes
out. I don't know if

226
00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:48.560
this is the kind of
thing we want to paint

227
00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:52.920
the natural Sexual program. My
wife likes me though. And

228
00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:54.660
that's all it matters. There
you go. My point about

229
00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:58.440
dance, dance revolution was that
I haven't picked up the

230
00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:04.110
controller that my X-Box intended
me to use in weeks.

231
00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:09.510
It's guitar hero, it's dance,
dance revolution, you know, it's

232
00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:13.710
the remote control. Sure. It's
the media center PC a

233
00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:16.500
wireless keyboard. Oh, you have
one of those that it's

234
00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:20.970
fantastic. These are all alternative
ways to interact with my

235
00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:23.610
system. And I speculate on
my blog a while ago

236
00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:26.640
that bill Gates is spending
all this money on voice.

237
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.860
And unless you have the
greatest computer in the history

238
00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:31.890
of the universe, voice and
Vista is a lot of

239
00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:35.730
like saying something and then
saying it again. Really? Have

240
00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:39.510
you tried it? You tried
it. Run calculator. Hope run,

241
00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:47.010
run cap. No, no run
calculator, Computer, computer, computer. I

242
00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:49.260
wonder if we should talk
about liquid aluminum as something?

243
00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.840
Yeah. Star Trek for voyage
home reference. Thank you very

244
00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:55.380
much. My point being though
that, what do we have?

245
00:13:55.710 --> 00:14:00.150
Sorry. Transparent. Aluminum had got
the Heron. I totally got

246
00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:02.220
the reference wrong. Sorry about
that. That's okay. It was

247
00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:04.170
an, actually, it was an
Apple se he was using

248
00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:07.620
this And he picked up
the mouse, the mouse James

249
00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:11.250
doing, we had the knee.
Yes. My point was that

250
00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:13.350
we've got all these new
ways. They're trying to have

251
00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:16.380
us interact with the computer.
They're are very expensive tablet,

252
00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:19.290
PC voice, which causes a
lot of CPU. And it's

253
00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:23.310
very productive, very problematic, but
we've got these $30 webcams.

254
00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:28.290
You've got an Xbox live
cam V extra fly vision

255
00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:30.690
camera on top of your
big screen TV and the

256
00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:32.220
extra room there. I do.
I use it and I

257
00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:34.320
use it for video conferences
with my team. Why aren't

258
00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:39.540
you gesturing a minority report
style? Oh, Cause I do

259
00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:42.900
gesture at my computer. You
do Rather than wearing gloves,

260
00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:45.510
kind of, you know, why
aren't we tracking our hands?

261
00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:48.420
My point being that like
giving the example of like

262
00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:51.290
Vista, if you've got three,
four windows on the screen

263
00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:54.230
at once and you want
to pick one up and

264
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:57.410
push it to another monitor.
Sure. You can pick the

265
00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:01.550
tiny, tiny area, surface area
of the title bar and

266
00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:04.490
drag it. You can Altspace
em, and then move it

267
00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:06.380
with the keyboard, which I'm
sure you do. You're not.

268
00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:10.340
Yes. Do. But there's only
four windows there. Why can't

269
00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:13.880
my web cam see my
hand and glean my intent

270
00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:17.720
to move those four windows
just as voice recognition can

271
00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:21.410
narrow down the number of
things that I could possibly

272
00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:26.420
intend to say a hand
gesture recognition system, all on

273
00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:29.840
minority report could glean that
he clearly has just reached

274
00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:32.660
out, clenched his hand. And
as if you were grabbing

275
00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:34.970
something, there's only four things
he could want to do.

276
00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:36.920
He wanted to lose one
of these four windows. So

277
00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:40.970
you're, you're actually talking about
almost what the we has

278
00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:44.780
done with our controller without
the controller. Yes. I'm saying

279
00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:48.530
that that whoever solves that
problem is going to have

280
00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:50.740
a license to print money.
And have you, Have you

281
00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:54.010
seen these amazing demonstrations of
this guy with this LCD

282
00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:57.340
panel? Daniel Hahn? Yes. This is
yes. And he did. He

283
00:15:57.340 --> 00:15:59.470
reaches in with all his
fingers and he just does

284
00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:03.550
these amazing manipulations, $3,000. I
propose that problem can be

285
00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:07.060
solved with a $30 webcam,
some really good stuff. So,

286
00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:09.250
you know, there, there are
tons of research people and

287
00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:13.840
I'm sure I, I'm not
positive. I'm sure that, But

288
00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:16.600
they're not working on it
in that, in that 10

289
00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:19.750
years ago, bill Gates announced
that voice and pens were

290
00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:22.120
the way of the future.
And they're just not quite

291
00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:25.270
there yet. They're baked into
ultimate, but they're still niche.

292
00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:28.000
I would say, I fully
agree with that. And I

293
00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.010
actually had a tablet for
a while because I wanted

294
00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:33.040
this experience. And what I
found was that a tablet

295
00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:35.680
was wonderful. Once you have
the document in front of

296
00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:38.260
you, that you wanted to
read a markup, but getting

297
00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.390
there was impossible without the
keyboard, At least for me.

298
00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:44.410
Yeah. I tried writing the
first draft of the asp.net

299
00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:46.570
chapters. I wrote for the
ASP to net book a

300
00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:49.030
totally a tablet. I have
this kind of like, all

301
00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:50.710
right, I'm going to go
With the cafe and have

302
00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:55.360
a coffee. Well, I wrote
a page and then I

303
00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:58.600
bought a copy of dragon
naturally speaking. Well, that's actually

304
00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:00.370
supposed to be really cool.
It's actually very good. It's

305
00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:02.500
a lot better than they
missed it. And there's a

306
00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:05.500
new Vista version for it
too. Yeah. But the quality

307
00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:09.160
of the microphone you need
is so immense, you need

308
00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:14.500
a hundred dollar microphone. Wow.
Really? Wow. Really? Yeah. You,

309
00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:15.940
you need a condenser mic
and you know, the nice

310
00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:18.100
news spectrum, Mike, you need
something quality. You can't just

311
00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:20.980
put a headphone on and
start spitting into the sea.

312
00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:24.070
This is the basic problem
I had with entering content

313
00:17:24.070 --> 00:17:29.230
into my tablet. I have
terrible handwriting. Right. So we

314
00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:34.630
needed the high quality handwriting
input mechanism other than me.

315
00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:38.920
And that was the problem.
Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. So, so,

316
00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:42.430
so the, the Kind of
a minority report UI thing

317
00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:46.330
you were talking, It has
a general purpose use Back

318
00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:51.090
around for future developers. I
think we get more kind

319
00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:55.350
of Wiziwig with not just
UI, but actual data bringing

320
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:58.110
back around the Excel reference
where I, where if I

321
00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:01.340
do a database. Yeah. I
actually see the data. It

322
00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:04.430
was a tech tech ready
tech Fest. I wasn't, there

323
00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:06.380
was a thing at Microsoft
where Rory did a bunch

324
00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:08.300
of stuff on this on
channel nine where it was

325
00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:10.400
all the research people that
are kind of research fellow.

326
00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:12.830
And they had been there
several times. So I had

327
00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:16.490
this kind of rubbery, graphical
view thing where it was

328
00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:20.810
basically like charts within, you
know, data binding and charting,

329
00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:25.280
except the data points didn't
they actually transitioned with animation.

330
00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:27.890
So you would turn a
bar chart into a pie

331
00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:31.790
chart and they, they, they
did all the tweening, the

332
00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:35.720
onion skinning, you know, dynamically
such that if this bar

333
00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:40.490
represents this data point, then
you can see it during

334
00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:44.090
the transition, stay that bar
start to morph into a

335
00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:47.870
piece of a pie. Wow.
So you can watch, this

336
00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:49.490
is okay. I know where
this data is in this

337
00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:51.200
graph. And now I'm going
to see where it is

338
00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:54.230
and this other graph, and
hopefully the different visualizations would

339
00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:57.230
give me better understanding my
name. It gives you context.

340
00:18:57.350 --> 00:19:01.280
So the actual animation itself
is providing you data as

341
00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:04.430
a, as an analyst. And
that's, I mean, the Xerox

342
00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:07.880
guys knew this, right? That
it's terrible to just blink

343
00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:11.330
new images at you and
have no transition. It's only,

344
00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:14.390
now that we've really got
kind of in general availability

345
00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:17.330
computer hardware that can actually
do this. Interesting. That's the

346
00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:21.320
one thing about Vista that
I miss when I go

347
00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:24.500
back to XP is the
little kind of subtle squish

348
00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:27.110
thing that you start when
you minimize the window. The

349
00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:29.060
thing that blew us away
so many years ago in

350
00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:32.330
the OSX, the genie effect,
I gave my dad a

351
00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:35.210
Mac last week and he
loves that stuff and it's

352
00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:38.690
just, Oh, it's there now
look, it's still going. The

353
00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:42.350
video is still running in
the, in the thumbnail. So

354
00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:45.470
I would say that for
me, the big things going

355
00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:47.660
forward that I see now,
15 years is a hell

356
00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:50.540
of a long time, but
I would say more and

357
00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:53.570
more declarative, which we brought
up a little bit. And

358
00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:56.750
certainly when we talk to
UI designing and, and data

359
00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:59.960
designing and, and you know,
the Excel style, that's all

360
00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.330
very declarative, right? Here's how
I want this stuff to

361
00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:07.460
relate. And I would say
that, you know, direct manipulation

362
00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:10.400
of things, right. Visual right
now, that kind of the

363
00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:14.120
biggest thing we've got for
programmers is a few designers

364
00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:17.330
and code. And if we
can get to more declarative

365
00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:20.600
coding styles, and if we
can get to kind of

366
00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:24.350
domain specific designers, and if
we could even go crazy

367
00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:27.350
with these, you know, data
gloves or, you know, $30

368
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:30.500
cameras watching my gestures so
I can manipulate the data

369
00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:33.080
or the definitions of that
data or the interactions that

370
00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:34.250
you're saying. I think that
it's the end of the

371
00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:38.270
model three, the whole data,
here's the view. And here's

372
00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:40.790
the data, Right? It's all
tickets, just the same thing.

373
00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:43.430
Yeah. And in fact, I
can imagine, you know, today

374
00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:45.770
I sit down and write
an Excel app and get

375
00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:47.890
the results I want and
throw it away tomorrow, sitting

376
00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:50.360
down And writing a real
app with a tree view,

377
00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:52.600
with a list view and
data really bound in real

378
00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:55.030
time, getting the result I
want and throwing it away

379
00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:58.180
because it's that fast. Well,
I would, I would actually

380
00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:00.850
extend that in one of
my things would be true.

381
00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:04.000
Location, transparency, not in the
object you way, but in

382
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.300
the application way. Right now,
Google is off trying to

383
00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:10.930
make Google PowerPoint. Right? Sure.
For sure. And that's just,

384
00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:12.850
there are two kinds of
apps. Now there's ones that

385
00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:15.130
run on your machine and
there's ones that run on

386
00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:17.140
the server. Right. And I
think that we're going to

387
00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:19.960
blur that so much, that
there's not going to be

388
00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:22.210
a way to really put
your finger on where this

389
00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:25.720
thing's running. So I would
say that flash was an

390
00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:28.330
attempt at that. A jacket
is an attempt to follow

391
00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:31.120
his attempt. I look at
Silverlight is a big attempt

392
00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:34.630
at that. Absolutely. Right. To
be able to merge the

393
00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:38.140
benefits of the multiple platforms,
doing the work. There's really

394
00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:41.140
no way to tell what
their Silverlight application right. Where

395
00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:44.410
the calculation is occurring. Right.
Right. And that's probably okay.

396
00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:47.170
Oh, absolutely. So long as
it happens, I don't really

397
00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:49.930
care where I want to
know when the windowing interface

398
00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:52.480
is going to be done.
What do you mean? Well,

399
00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:55.540
right now, the closest thing
we've done in this that

400
00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:59.380
are really blowing people's minds,
as far as fundamentally challenging

401
00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:02.860
metaphors is like flip 3d
and those kinds of things,

402
00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:05.380
you know, when he introduced
us three D space, but

403
00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:07.420
it doesn't actually provide any
value. It doesn't probably any

404
00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:11.350
data. Oh, look a Z
axis. Yay. But is it

405
00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:14.170
all just is, is, is
the human brain hard wired

406
00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:18.190
for pointers and icons and
windows? Oh, clearly got to

407
00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:20.590
be a different metaphor. I
agree with that. And I

408
00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:23.620
know that a ton of
people have spent time with

409
00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:26.110
this, but even, so if
you look at, you know,

410
00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:29.050
the guy who's been doing
the cool interaction stuff, like

411
00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:32.080
he's got a table full
of pictures that he's rearranging

412
00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:34.600
and resizing and they're squares
with stuff in them. Yeah.

413
00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:37.270
Yeah. Yeah. On the other
hand, he's got a, a

414
00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:41.860
three D map view. Yeah.
So, you know, he's starting

415
00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:43.550
to get it. They're starting
to get into the three

416
00:22:43.550 --> 00:22:48.190
D you see the, build
your own glove to manipulate

417
00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:51.730
Google earth. Basically you buy
a pair of gloves and

418
00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:54.190
you paint the fingers of
them. You hook up a

419
00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:56.800
camera and he will detect
your fingers based on the

420
00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:59.250
color and allow you to
manipulate the Google or home

421
00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:05.890
man that rocks. So declarative
direct manipulation of data, as

422
00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:10.360
well as UI and domain
specific languages. I see. Or

423
00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:14.470
domain specific editors and even
crazy stuff like, you know,

424
00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:17.830
direct manipulation with hand gestures
and voice. And I see

425
00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:22.420
those as big things coming.
Cool. Maybe I'll see you

426
00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:24.280
again in a couple weeks.
Absolutely happy to have you

427
00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:26.980
here. Thanks you guys for
listening to us babble and

428
00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:30.190
in the office of presales,
and this has been another

429
00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:31.150
episode of Hansel minutes.
