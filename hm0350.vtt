In this episode, Rob talks

9
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:58.860
to Scott Hanselman about midlife
crises. Hi, this is Rob

10
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.400
great. And it's another episode
of Connor. Eight minutes today.

11
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.320
I am interviewing mr. Scott
Hanselman. I don't know why

12
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.810
I find that so stupid
every time. Hey. No. Okay.

13
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.900
It just has to happen.
How are you today, sir?

14
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.540
I'm I'm always uncomfortable when
you're on the show rack

15
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.430
on it. I'm hijacking your
show. I sent you an

16
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.220
email and I said, Scott,
it's time to hijack the

17
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.080
show again. He's more cowbell.
Exactly. The reason I wanted

18
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.560
to hijack your show is
you have a birthday coming

19
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.600
up. So do I, when
is your birthday? January 17th. Oh,

20
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.670
wow. That is very soon.
Yeah. Mine's couple days after

21
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.550
her as well. Okay. You
and me and Phil I'll

22
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.040
have birthdays within one week.
I believe it feels like

23
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.390
24 now. He doesn't count.
That's true. Yeah. Well, the

24
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.000
interesting thing is I was
thinking the other day about

25
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.550
my birthday and I was
just, I was joking on

26
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.580
Twitter and I said, Oh
my gosh, you know, I'm

27
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.540
almost 29, which is a
lie and a bunch of

28
00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.500
years. Have you been 29?
Yeah, at least 44. Now

29
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.030
I'm going to be turning
45. Really? It was funny.

30
00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.180
I just, yeah, I just
sort of went off about,

31
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.700
Oh my gosh, I'm going
to be 29. I haven't

32
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.660
found it a startup yet.
Where's my, where's my big

33
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.270
payout. How come I not
in Silicon Valley? I don't

34
00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.300
know. Just all this stuff.
Just having fun. You're a

35
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.210
horrible person. Well, he got
me thinking it got me

36
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.200
thinking, you know, I have
some pretty interesting reactions as

37
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.070
to you, right? When we
see certain types of behavior.

38
00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.370
Yeah. And what we call
like the whole get off

39
00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.560
my lawn reaction. Yeah, yeah.
Yeah. We're not elderly programmers

40
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.240
of any means. Right. But
we are, there is a

41
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.050
generation that is different. Right.
I like talking to programmers

42
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.020
in their sixties because I
think that they have really

43
00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.610
interesting perspectives on, on, on
what it was like programmed

44
00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.070
before. And they have 20
years on me. Right. So

45
00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.350
I enjoy talking to programmers
also that I have 20

46
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.020
years on, You know, that
I'm, I am 20 years

47
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.960
older than, and I think
it's funny when people in

48
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:10.960
their, in their, in their
twenties, 25 ish get angsty

49
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.010
about their, their success or
relative lack of success or

50
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:21.430
whatever. And I find that,
that people can get these

51
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.490
bubbles around themselves. You know,
like there's the, there's the

52
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.100
Silicon Valley bubble, but there's
this whole startup thing, this,

53
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.960
this obsession with the startup.
And I don't know. I

54
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.490
think sometimes the, the, the
young people forget that we're

55
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:35.440
not really building stuff. You
know what I mean? Like

56
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.350
we're building stuff, but it's
very ephemeral. It doesn't last

57
00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.850
very long it's and, and
it's not, you know, unless

58
00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.490
it's like saving babies, what
is it that you're building?

59
00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.220
That's so amazing, right? If
you will, I've building a

60
00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.790
B2B marketplace that, you know,
allows people to, you know,

61
00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.110
whatever, like, remember that, remember
expired foods.com your buddies. Great

62
00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.960
idea. Right? It's a, B
to B marketplace, mobile B2B

63
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:05.200
marketplace for expired foods. I
mean, it really is that,

64
00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:10.150
is that get a passport
and go travel somewhere. Don't

65
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:15.270
you think? I do. I
do. But an interesting thing

66
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.550
happened as I was driving
home. After my little Twitter

67
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:22.320
rant, the tables turned in
my head as I put

68
00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.330
myself, like, what if I
really was about to turn

69
00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.310
29? I mean, I had
a lot of anxiety back

70
00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.510
then as most 20 somethings
seem to have. And what

71
00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.520
if I was listening to
this podcast and these two

72
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.950
old guys are sitting there
talking about how dumb all

73
00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.830
the young guys are. Right.
I would be just as

74
00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.250
agitated, but in a reverse
directions. That make sense. Yeah,

75
00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.070
I suppose so. But that
presumes that, Oh, are you

76
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.940
older young that you're listening?
Oh, and let's say my

77
00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.310
young self is listening to
this Young self. Well, your

78
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.250
young self presumes that, you
know everything and you've got

79
00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.970
it all figured out. Right.
And young self is offended

80
00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.120
by, you know, those old
guys they're, they're not thinking

81
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.150
clearly. And they don't, they
don't understand. They don't have

82
00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.480
the perspective that we have
as, as, as younger people,

83
00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.140
blah, blah, blah. Right. Yeah.
It's weird. It's the forces

84
00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:14.640
of change. So for instance,
you're sitting, imagine yourself now

85
00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:19.290
sitting in an audience in
Vegas, right. And you're at

86
00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:22.530
a, you're at a talk
and these young guys up

87
00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.590
on stage with a fohawk
and boom, the F word

88
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.580
gets splashed across the, across
the screen. And he's got

89
00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.410
this sly look in his
face, like, you know, am

90
00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:33.990
I not clever? You know,
and you roll your eyes.

91
00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.730
Oh gosh, really? We're going
to have to sit through

92
00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:40.980
this now go up on
stage. So you're the young

93
00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:44.460
guy on stage. You're giving
the talk you're about to,

94
00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.340
you've put so much love
and effort into it. And

95
00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:48.540
then you look out there
and you see this old

96
00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:52.350
dude sitting there rolling his
eyes at you. I'm so

97
00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:54.630
curious about that. I don't
want to be the old

98
00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:57.090
guy, like get off my
lawn. You kids, we joke

99
00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:59.840
get off my lawn. But
do you ever think that

100
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.990
maybe we're sliding into some
sort of cliche ourselves? So

101
00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.650
you know how, when you're
talking to your kids, you've

102
00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:13.720
probably noticed this, that you'll
hear your father's voice or

103
00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.440
your mother's voice. You'll hear,
not just that, you'll say

104
00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.570
the same things, but you'll
say it and you'll go,

105
00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:23.170
wow. Everything there was exactly,
as he would say it,

106
00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.110
that was like, so almost
just a cliche. I have

107
00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:30.340
become my father. Right. That,
that doesn't, that is not

108
00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:33.700
a, an, a thing that
just happened to me. That

109
00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:37.240
is a universal truth, right?
There is no question in

110
00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.750
my mind that every single
person who has kids is

111
00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:43.150
having that experience at least
a couple of times a

112
00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:46.420
year, if not a couple
of times a week where

113
00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:48.730
I'll say something and I've
even, I've even thought that

114
00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:51.940
I've seen him, he ever
like walking down the street

115
00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:55.360
and then you walk by
like a big department store

116
00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.910
window and you go, Whoa.
And then you look and

117
00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:04.510
it's you, Right? Yep. Okay.
That's like the human experience.

118
00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:08.890
That is how it's supposed
to happen. So as, as

119
00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:11.950
Jenner, and again, to be
clear to the folks that

120
00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:13.840
are older than us, when
we say old guys, we're

121
00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.420
just, you know, we're just
feeling our midlife crisis here.

122
00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:20.920
No, no disrespect intended, but
we're, we, we only get

123
00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.860
to pick on the kids
that are younger, but we,

124
00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.050
you know, when you roll
your eyes and the audience,

125
00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.020
is that a cliche? Well,
you could call it a

126
00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:30.820
cliche, but you could also
just say that it is

127
00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:34.420
absolutely as things are supposed
to be. That's true. Yeah.

128
00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:36.520
It seems there needs to
be some type of tension

129
00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:42.460
where wisdom gained needs to
be tested. And it's, it's

130
00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:45.640
hard for me. It's hard
for me to deal with

131
00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:47.590
that. Getting older. I like,
look at my birthday. I'm

132
00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:52.720
45, right. I have been
through two bubbles now that

133
00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:55.630
I know more languages, I
forgot more languages that many

134
00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:58.240
people have actually learned. That
is such an old guy

135
00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.880
thing to say. It is.
And so it's funny when

136
00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.670
you're talking to people like
John Sheehan, you know, and

137
00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:06.220
who likes to call us,
you know, Our, our lovely

138
00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:08.920
friend, John Sheehan, who we
tease about age, to be

139
00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:11.170
clear, to make sure that
we're not, we're not singling

140
00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:13.360
John out. Yeah. Yeah. I
met, I met with John,

141
00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.430
we had dinner and some,
you know, the other night

142
00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:18.820
when were in San Francisco
and it's so funny, I,

143
00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:21.760
I find myself giving him
advice and I can see

144
00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.800
the look in his eyes,
which is like, dude, I

145
00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:28.390
got it covered. You know,
Dude, we need to get

146
00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:31.750
that dude. I've got it.
covered.com. Like we need a

147
00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:35.860
tumbler of just pictures of
young people with looks on

148
00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:39.700
their faces. Like I got
this, just go away. You

149
00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:44.440
and your gray beard, you
know, your neck beard. Yeah.

150
00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.000
And I'm like, I've been
through two bubbles and this

151
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.030
is what I think. And
he's like, okay, fine. I'm

152
00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:52.570
sure I'm making moves, man.
I'm making money. It's so

153
00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:56.830
funny. So what does it
mean To you? How are

154
00:08:56.830 --> 00:09:01.010
you going to be 39,
39, 39. So you're facing

155
00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:04.370
40. I mean, does that,
does that feel, Does it

156
00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:09.290
feel different to you? It's
less about the number because

157
00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:12.350
dork that I am like,
okay, well, you know, base

158
00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:15.080
10, I'm 40, you know
what I mean? It's just

159
00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:17.630
like, that's kind of how
I'm doing or I'm 39,

160
00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.580
you know what I mean?
That's, I'm just, I'm justifying

161
00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:22.790
it in like other ways,
but you know, I'm 47

162
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:24.350
base eight, you know, I'm
just like, you know, you

163
00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:26.450
work it out in your
head, like all the different

164
00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:29.480
things that, all the different
things that you're going to

165
00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:31.370
be. Like, I like to
think of myself as being,

166
00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:36.200
you know, a hundred thousand,
111, you know, in binary,

167
00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:41.960
that would be much, much
more comforting. Right. But is

168
00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.600
it, it's not that it's
40 and it's around number.

169
00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:47.510
It's more that it's the
percent, the progress bar is

170
00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:49.790
what bothers me. You see
what I'm saying? It's, it's

171
00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:55.190
the 40% of the way
there. And that's optimistic. It's

172
00:09:55.190 --> 00:10:00.710
more than I'm probably over
halfway there. Right. And that's,

173
00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:04.550
that's really concerning. So it's,
it's 40 represents around number,

174
00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:07.730
but 40 really represents, okay.
That was half of my

175
00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:11.420
life. And the worst part
about the realization that this

176
00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:13.640
has been half of your
life is the, you only

177
00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:17.750
had control over the last
half of that half. Does

178
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:20.300
that make sense? Yeah. So
I really only had control

179
00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:23.090
over the last 20 years
for the first 20, for

180
00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:26.480
the first 10. You're pretty
much on autopilot, somewhere around

181
00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:31.730
15, you get, get a
kind of consciousness, but arguably

182
00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:35.090
that is just useless until
you're somewhere around 17 or

183
00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:37.940
18. I don't know. This
is just my opinion, but

184
00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:40.400
I don't think your brain
really shuts on and tell

185
00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:45.140
you about 22. And it's
a challenge. So I'm a

186
00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:47.180
little sad, like, wow, I'm
halfway there. And I only

187
00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:50.450
had 20 good years. That's
kinda my math. It's fuzzy

188
00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:52.340
math, but that's what I'm
doing. Yeah. Well, there's some

189
00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:54.050
people who would say you
still don't have control. In

190
00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:55.820
fact, I think I talked
to Mo the other day

191
00:10:55.820 --> 00:11:00.920
and she mentioned your lack
of control. Okay. That's random.

192
00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.380
Okay. Just have to throw
out a small dig. You

193
00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:07.970
know what I mean? It's
just, that bothers me. And

194
00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:11.570
I thinking about the progress
bar, it gets me thinking

195
00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:14.060
about that idea of living
life by default. Did you

196
00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:16.070
read that article about living
in your life by default?

197
00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:18.710
Yeah, it's an article. I
think it was like the

198
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:22.010
new Yorker or something. And
it was basically saying here's

199
00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:24.050
what happens when you live
your life by default and

200
00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:25.930
it was, did they, did
they made up this, this

201
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.360
theoretical person. Okay. And you
know, I think he ends

202
00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:32.120
up kind of, you know,
falling into school at somewhere

203
00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:35.780
and then getting married and
having kids. And everything's fine,

204
00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:39.650
but nothing was particularly amazing
or impressive. He basically just

205
00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:42.140
takes all of the defaults
and you think he ends

206
00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:45.980
up, you know, working at
a, at a cardboard, resale,

207
00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:48.710
a cardboard recycling plant or
whatever, you know what I

208
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:51.980
mean? Something kind of dull
and kind of unimpressive. And

209
00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:53.860
he ends up being an
office manager, whatever, and that's

210
00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:56.410
fine if that's satisfying and
if you have a great

211
00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:59.650
home life. Sure. But the
point was, he had a

212
00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:05.260
wholly and completely on interesting
life, right. That doesn't mean

213
00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:07.900
go all the other direction
and then become a, a

214
00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:11.770
startup person and go in
and create something or, or

215
00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:14.290
become a doctor or, or
people who work in cardboard.

216
00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:17.530
Recycling plants are bad people.
It just means if you

217
00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:21.430
take the defaults, then are
you really living? You know

218
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:23.320
what I mean? I think
that the midlife crisis that

219
00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:27.370
everyone hears about is the
attempt for the 40 year

220
00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:31.900
old person to reassert the,
I have control of my

221
00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:35.350
life thing. Right. I just
think that people should use

222
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:39.400
that opportunity to start working
out and eating right. Instead

223
00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:44.770
of buying little convertible, you
know, cars and that, you

224
00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:50.220
know, the kind of more,
more prototypical midlife crisis. Yeah.

225
00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:53.070
You're making me think of
a show. I just watched

226
00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:56.430
the other day, where are
these, these guys go to

227
00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:59.610
India and they're going to
do this motorcycle ride across

228
00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:03.150
the Himalaya and they're following
this guru. And they're all,

229
00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:06.750
you know, my age, mid
forties, fifties, whatever. And they're

230
00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:11.460
just so completely self absorbed
about their enlightenment. And they

231
00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:13.680
need to do this because
society has always told them

232
00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:17.130
XYZ Bothers me because those
people don't even realize that

233
00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:21.030
what print would have privileges
to have the money to

234
00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:22.680
have been on that trip.
You know what I mean?

235
00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:25.680
Like it's like, Oh, I'm
climbing the Himalayas. Okay. That's

236
00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:29.490
great. Did you hire a
Sherpa? Yes. Well then you

237
00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:31.490
got a pretty sweet gig.
I mean, you're in your,

238
00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:35.490
you are the 1%, unless
you like rolled in there

239
00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:37.830
on your, on your vintage
motorcycle and you did the

240
00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:40.710
whole thing, like on a
shoe string. It's pretty much

241
00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:45.420
to be said that you
are, are doing okay. Yeah.

242
00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:47.490
I don't know. I think
for me personally, as I,

243
00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:49.980
as I face down 50
I'm, I'm about halfway there.

244
00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:54.330
I find that that anxiety
that creeps in where, you

245
00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:56.100
know, they get off my
lawn thing where you're looking

246
00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:59.460
at the young guys are,
you know, is, is just

247
00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:02.880
the inverse of the psychosis
I had when I was

248
00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:05.370
in my twenties. You know,
both times I'm trying to

249
00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:08.070
control it and just say,
look, take life. As it

250
00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:10.980
comes and stop being so
self centered, you don't need

251
00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:13.260
to found the next great
startup, you know? And, and

252
00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:15.960
that's one of the reasons
I'm out here in Hawaii,

253
00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:18.420
but I find myself on
the other end of that

254
00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:22.770
now facing down that anxiety
of, of feeling irrelevant, I

255
00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:24.960
guess, you know, like you're
not listening to me. I

256
00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:28.170
have wisdom and I'm not,
I'm not old, you know?

257
00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:30.510
And then, you know, Yeah.
That's the definitely what you

258
00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:33.870
don't want to do at
our age. Exactly. I don't

259
00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:35.550
know. Do you ever find
yourself having to fight that

260
00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:37.620
back? Like imagine John Sheehan
looking at you going dude,

261
00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:39.840
I got it covered, but
that's always how John looks

262
00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:43.710
at me. It's true. It's
true. But do you find

263
00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:45.780
yourself having to fight that
down and just say, Oh,

264
00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:50.410
just let it go. Who
cares? Well, the, the, the,

265
00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:54.410
the, the, I'm trying to
think of an analogy here,

266
00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:56.180
but I don't want to,
I'm not trying to pull

267
00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:58.640
an analogy between the young
people that we talk to

268
00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:01.940
and my kids, but sure.
One wants your kids to

269
00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:06.200
listen to you and receive
the benefits of your wisdom,

270
00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:09.740
but also make their own
mistakes. So you try to

271
00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:14.480
protect them from making the
major stupid mistakes well, allowing

272
00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:20.960
them to, to make appropriate
mistakes with reasonable, natural consequences.

273
00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:25.700
Right? So, you know, John,
here's something you might want

274
00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:28.130
using John as the example
again, and we're going to

275
00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:31.250
get in trouble for this,
by the way, you know,

276
00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:33.230
you should be thinking about
this and this and this

277
00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:35.240
when you're founding the next
great startup and, you know,

278
00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:37.850
be aware that this might
seem like an awesome idea,

279
00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:40.730
but it turns out that
this is a red herring,

280
00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:43.400
you know, good luck on
your, on your journey, but

281
00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:46.220
I hope you've considered XYZ.
You know, when you make

282
00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:51.230
the mistake that will inevitably
happen, have these systems in

283
00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:54.290
place to back you up,
that's a different kind of

284
00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:57.410
feedback than you really don't
want to do that. That's

285
00:15:57.410 --> 00:15:59.210
just stupid. Find something else
to do. You know what

286
00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:02.230
I mean? Absolutely. You know,
I think, you know, some,

287
00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:05.800
a little mantra came to
me, this is not gonna

288
00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:09.130
make much sense, but I
think an interesting way of

289
00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:13.310
looking at this is what
would war do and honestly,

290
00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:16.900
ward Cunningham. I, because I
keep thinking about the interview

291
00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:20.380
that you did for this
developer's life podcast and the

292
00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:22.900
excitement and energy and love,
and his voice, same with

293
00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:25.780
Billy Hill, but see The two
guys that were in their

294
00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:28.990
sixties and seventies. Right. And
I want to be like

295
00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:31.360
that just alive, you know,
and like, Oh, what a

296
00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:33.400
neat idea, John? You know
what, by the way, John

297
00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:35.260
Sheehan is not going to
be mad at you. If

298
00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:37.090
anything, he's going to be
tickled pink. We're talking about

299
00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:39.040
him this much. Well, yeah.
Yeah. But I think the

300
00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.720
thing that you're describing to
me is that what is

301
00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:43.540
it that we like about
ward, right? Is that he's

302
00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:47.680
just so freaking stoked. Right?
Exactly. Like when I went

303
00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:50.080
over to his place a
couple of times, and I

304
00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:52.000
go down into the basement
and it's like, you know,

305
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.130
what are you working on?
And he just lights up.

306
00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:57.400
And then, you know, you're
looking at like Arduinos that

307
00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:59.500
he's hooked up to plants
to make sure that the

308
00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:03.520
water is like, the dirt
is moist. And it texts

309
00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:06.790
him whenever the plant needs
water. And he's got all

310
00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:11.800
these temperature sensors throughout the
house. So like he knows

311
00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:15.160
the historical temperature over the
last several years of different

312
00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:18.760
corners of his house is
exploring why the Northwest corner

313
00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:21.250
is warmer than the Southwest
corner, you know, but he's

314
00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:25.840
totally, totally amped about it.
So, you know, I don't

315
00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:29.110
care whether John has a
startup or not, or whether

316
00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:30.970
it succeeds or not. What
I care about is whether

317
00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:34.330
he's just totally stoked about
it. Yup. You see what

318
00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:37.780
I'm saying? So I think
that the lesson is then,

319
00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:40.660
do you know, did I
build something great is less

320
00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:45.880
interesting than did I have
a total blast doing it

321
00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:51.240
Exactly. Right. Have a good
time and enjoy what you

322
00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:55.410
do, because that's all you
got and, you know, be

323
00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:58.830
okay if someone doesn't listen
to you, I guess is

324
00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:01.170
kind of the thing that
I keep thinking about. And,

325
00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:03.870
and it keeps me sane,
to be honest. Yeah. How

326
00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:07.400
about you? Yeah. I think
that, that's it also, now

327
00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:09.230
that I have already built
a lot of stuff, I

328
00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:11.600
like to make sure that
other people are having fun.

329
00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:15.170
So my, my building is
making sure other people are

330
00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:18.440
having fun building things. Yeah.
So I want to make

331
00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:21.710
sure, like I've got cousins
and nieces and nephews and

332
00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:23.630
sons, and I want to
make sure that they're all

333
00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:28.490
having, having fun. So I
try to figure out what

334
00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:33.050
I can do to engender
that amount of, of stoke

335
00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:36.170
goodness. If that's a word
being stoked in, in the

336
00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:40.430
kids, like I really find
the disaffected teenager thing disappointing.

337
00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.910
Yeah. I I'm a fan
of, I don't know where

338
00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:46.370
that internal fire comes from,
but I'm a fan of

339
00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:49.160
when I meet a team
and by team, I mean,

340
00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:53.390
anywhere from, you know, 15
to 20 who's jazzed about

341
00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:56.840
something, usually creation is what
makes me the most excited.

342
00:18:56.870 --> 00:19:00.020
So if you're stoked about
building and I think that

343
00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:04.370
that's cool and if you're
15 or 16 or 17,

344
00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:06.560
and you're like, yeah, I
don't know. I was like,

345
00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:09.680
wow, how can we get
this person jazzed? That's what

346
00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:11.180
I think, you know what
I mean? How can we

347
00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:12.920
turn that on? It might
not be building stuff. It

348
00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:16.340
might be something entirely different
I haven't thought of, but

349
00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:18.770
they will feel much better
when they have a reason

350
00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:21.260
to wake up in the
morning. Yeah. I think, you

351
00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:26.660
know, be the jazz, speaking
of, at your house when

352
00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:29.240
you're describing all these things,
I remember going to your

353
00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:31.580
house. I think it was
when we did the video

354
00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:35.900
for tech pub and your
garage full of all these

355
00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:39.050
little Hansel projects, what was
it? Your, you had a

356
00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:41.330
video arcade that you made
me play with you for

357
00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:43.190
a while. And then you
showed me your Legos that

358
00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:45.290
you had going. And that's
such a weird thing to

359
00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:48.980
say, but My 45 year
old friend came over to

360
00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:50.360
my house and we played
Legos. You know, it was

361
00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:53.810
just like, Oh, hell that's,
that's what it's like going

362
00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:57.320
to your house. But it's
fun. It's a little playground.

363
00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:59.960
And I, and to your
point, I think the way

364
00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:03.080
you, you get your kids,
or let's say when they

365
00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:07.490
turn teenagers or other teenagers,
whatever excited is to is

366
00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:09.560
to be excited in the
same way that ward excited

367
00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:13.700
us, you know, with his
enthusiasm and vitality is, you

368
00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:15.740
know, more people need to
be like that. For sure.

369
00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:19.130
It would be sad to
not be jazzed about something.

370
00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:20.840
And it doesn't end the
being jazzed about something. It

371
00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:25.070
doesn't necessarily have to be
your, your job, but it's

372
00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:28.880
always nice if it is.
Yeah. Do you know how

373
00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:30.620
many people out there now
are going to just call

374
00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:32.830
this our midlife crisis episode?
We want to, we could

375
00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:37.040
let's call it that Conrad
minutes to the Midland Episode.

376
00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:38.930
Yeah. And by the way,
did I tell you I'm

377
00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:40.850
planning a motorcycle trip across
the way you want to

378
00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:42.950
go with the horse? You
are. I got my guru.

379
00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:46.820
There's no way, dude. I
have, I have less than

380
00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:51.320
no interest in doing that
Negative interest. You were actively

381
00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:54.780
<inaudible> Yes. I'm going to
stop it from happening. No,

382
00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:56.310
I know everyone's got their
own thing. You know, you

383
00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:57.720
got it. If you want
to do your motorcycle trip,

384
00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:59.520
that's fine. What I'm going
to ask you now, we're

385
00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:02.540
going to get in trouble
from motorcycle trip people. The

386
00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:06.660
point is that there's a
difference between like paying someone

387
00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:09.420
$10,000 and having the entire
trip handled for you. You

388
00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:11.100
know what I mean? It's
like when you go on

389
00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:15.600
those rafting trips and like,
all the food is like

390
00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:17.280
set up for you at
the end of the trip.

391
00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:18.930
Like you get, you know,
you like you do your

392
00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:21.330
rafting and then you get
off the boat. And then

393
00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:24.060
there's like a full meal
with like a chef. And

394
00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:26.430
like they've set up the
tables and stuff. Cause you

395
00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:30.180
know, that's somehow less impressive
and, and less of the

396
00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:35.700
journey. Yeah. Yeah. So as
you're, as you're describing this,

397
00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:38.130
I'm wondering if there's anything
that would make you change

398
00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:42.390
your mind about going no,
no. Yeah. Come on Scott.

399
00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:46.710
Let's go about, so I'm
trying to envision a situation

400
00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:49.500
where a startup calls you
and you know, we've got

401
00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:52.200
this great idea and let's
say it's, you know, related

402
00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:55.110
to something that means a
lot to you and you

403
00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:58.350
can stay. You don't think
that I'm negative. I'm anti-static

404
00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:01.560
No, not at all, but
I'm one, but for me,

405
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.870
yeah. I wasn't thinking this
conversation at anything to do

406
00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:07.140
with startups in general, started
to startup was the yeah.

407
00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:10.050
Risk. That's the point. Yeah.
So the point would be

408
00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:12.930
that they have an opportunity.
You can work from Portland

409
00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:14.820
and not Portland. You can
work from your house. They're

410
00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:17.370
gonna, they want to come
in and do some stuff.

411
00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:20.400
And would you ever take
a job like that? Assuming,

412
00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:22.230
you know, I know you're
happy at Microsoft and everything.

413
00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:24.000
Yeah. Yeah. This has nothing
to do with Microsoft or

414
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.220
not. It definitely risk. I'm
not in a, in a

415
00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:31.050
particularly risky mood right now
when you have, when you're,

416
00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:34.980
you know, you're getting your
money ready for retirement, you

417
00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:37.890
know, you don't want necessarily
put that on the, put

418
00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:41.190
that on the line. Certainly.
I'm just wondering, would there

419
00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:44.400
ever be something so meaningful
to you that you're so

420
00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:46.650
passionate about that would make
you risk and make you

421
00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:51.540
take that chance? Is there
something interesting that I would

422
00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:53.370
take that I would go
and do? Sure. Is there

423
00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:55.320
something that I would risk
stuff on? No, I'm not

424
00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:58.710
going to risk my, my
retirement now. That doesn't mean

425
00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:02.820
that I work at Microsoft
for retirement purposes. I had,

426
00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:06.960
I had, I had money
before Microsoft, you know, I

427
00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:10.560
did a lot of stuff.
There's a billion, a billion

428
00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:14.010
dollars. No, I'm just saying
that, that, that the Microsoft

429
00:23:14.010 --> 00:23:17.430
paycheck is lovely that Microsoft
healthcare is lovely, but I

430
00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:21.120
don't, it's not the thing
that like pays the bills

431
00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:23.880
as far as, you know,
one has investments and stuff.

432
00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:28.110
The point I'm making about
risk is, is that, would

433
00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:31.800
I, would I take a
risk at, at 40? No,

434
00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:33.720
I'm not going to take
any risks. That means that

435
00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:36.000
my family might be homeless.
I've got kids that are

436
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.600
going to go to college.
Would I take do a

437
00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:43.140
different thing, a lateral type
thing? Of course, of course.

438
00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:46.250
I'm just saying that I'm
am I going to sell

439
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:49.070
my house and move to
the Bay area? And then,

440
00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:51.380
you know, take, take my
life savings and my, and

441
00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:54.020
my kids' college education and
pour it into an idea.

442
00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:57.050
No, there's no need to
do that. Cause I've been

443
00:23:57.380 --> 00:23:59.180
around a long enough. I'm
sure I would find some

444
00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:02.410
investor to be able to
pull. Yeah, absolutely. And here's

445
00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:07.810
why I bring this up.
I find that the older

446
00:24:07.810 --> 00:24:11.650
I get, the less likely
I am to entertain an

447
00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:13.360
idea like, Oh, we've got
a great idea for a

448
00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:15.490
startup. Come join us Robin.
Not really. I don't, I

449
00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:20.530
don't think so. It's not
appealing to me and I,

450
00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:22.600
and I, and I wonder
sometimes if that's going to

451
00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:26.530
strengthen as I get older,
but then my good buddy

452
00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:33.070
Todd, who is 52, just
left his job as a

453
00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:37.120
consultant and decided to go
back to school and become

454
00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:40.270
a physical therapist. And I
asked him why he did

455
00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:42.340
this. And I saw you
having a midlife crisis, you

456
00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:43.900
know, what's going on? He
said, no, no, he probably

457
00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:46.780
just switches careers. It was
just interesting to me. And

458
00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:49.750
I said, his is a
chemical engineer. Right. And very

459
00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:52.390
well paid consultant. And I
said, well, I don't understand.

460
00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:54.520
Are you, you know, were
you being unfulfilled? He's like,

461
00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:57.550
no, I just wanted to
change. And it occurred to

462
00:24:57.550 --> 00:25:01.210
me that there could be
a time when something swings

463
00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:06.130
right out of the blue
and everything changes. And just

464
00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:09.010
for some reason, I just
never entertained that idea so

465
00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:11.320
much. And I guess I
was, that's the kind of

466
00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:13.450
question I was asking As
being different. I think that

467
00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:15.940
the, okay, I understand what
you're saying. So yeah. Would

468
00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:18.160
I ever quit and like
become a nurse or something?

469
00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:21.760
Sure, absolutely. I don't think
that that's a risky, that's

470
00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:26.110
just the moving to a
different career. Yeah. Yeah. It's

471
00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:29.320
just a, I don't know.
I find that very interesting

472
00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:32.220
that y'all you get to
a point where you, you

473
00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:35.650
stop entertaining ideas of jumping
ship and you think, okay,

474
00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:38.890
I'm happy where I am.
Right. Things are cruising along

475
00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:41.740
and then boom, everything changes.
And I hope that I'm

476
00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:44.410
able to be flexible enough
to say, okay, Let's go.

477
00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:46.780
Yeah, absolutely. Well, my wife
is switching careers, right? I

478
00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:49.090
mean, she went from a
career in finance and nonprofit

479
00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:51.970
and she's going to become
a nurse. I've talked about

480
00:25:51.970 --> 00:25:54.460
becoming either a nurse or
a doctor. I don't know

481
00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:56.380
if I'm totally too old
to be a doctor, but

482
00:25:56.740 --> 00:25:59.380
that's extremely interesting to me.
I mean, I spend a

483
00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:03.220
lot of time arguing with
doctors anyway, you know, me

484
00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:08.110
and dr. Google, dr. Sciencey
liked that very much so.

485
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.680
So yeah. I think that'd
be great. If anyone wants

486
00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:13.660
to pay for me to
become a doctor, I'd be

487
00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:16.690
more than happy to, to
make that happen. I think,

488
00:26:16.690 --> 00:26:18.550
I think that would be
no seriously. I certainly I'm

489
00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:21.280
really interested in, so yeah,
something I could do something

490
00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:25.720
like that. And I don't
know. I don't know if

491
00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:27.760
it'd be endocrinology or what
I would do, but yeah.

492
00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:29.980
Good question. I could see
you. I could seriously, I

493
00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:33.460
could see you working on
something like diabetes, you know,

494
00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:36.550
later in life. I like
the idea of actually seeing

495
00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:38.170
patients. You know what I
mean? I don't want to

496
00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:41.680
be a researcher, like literally
seeing patients and hanging out

497
00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:42.760
with them. Cause I think
I would be good at

498
00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:44.850
that. I, I, but at
the same time, this is

499
00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:46.710
the thing. If I went
on to become a doctor,

500
00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:49.050
I would probably end up
just teaching. You know what

501
00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:51.240
I mean? But yeah, I
was gonna say, I could

502
00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:53.280
see, like, you're making a
point with dr. Hanselman. You

503
00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:55.530
go in the room and
you sit down and you

504
00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:58.710
go look at this new
x-ray reader. I have. This

505
00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:01.290
is so cool. And have
you ever seen this and

506
00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:03.510
45 minutes go by and
see what, what are you

507
00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:07.370
here for now? Yeah, exactly.
That's that's a problem showing

508
00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:10.530
it. Yeah. Like look at
this app sort of thing

509
00:27:10.530 --> 00:27:16.080
that people would like, appreciate
that. Well, Scott, thank you

510
00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:17.820
for letting me take over
your show again. We kind

511
00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:20.430
of wandered this conversation a
little bit, but I think

512
00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:22.950
there is something listable in
there. Maybe a minute or

513
00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:24.990
two. You're not going to
invite me back or you're

514
00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:27.300
never coming back on the
show. All right. Fine. All

515
00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:31.830
right. Bye. Bye. Bye. This
has been another episode of

516
00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:35.130
gunnery minutes. You're on the
Hansel minutes show. We'll see

517
00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:37.710
you again next week, blah,
blah, blah. No shatter. Gimme

518
00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:42.900
Scottish. Scottish. I can't do
Scottish on demand. See, you

519
00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:46.950
can try it. It's my
show. Oh God, this is

520
00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:50.130
I can't. I can do
Scotty now. I can't do

521
00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:52.110
it. I get my fine.
I can't find my tongue.

522
00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:53.880
Cause you know, when you
want to do an impression,

523
00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:57.240
you have to like find
a word or a phrase

524
00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:59.100
to start it off. You
know what I mean? All

525
00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:01.060
right. Tonight. Show. How about
tonight? Johnny Carson? You can do,

526
00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:03.360
I can let you do
that. Let me see. Let

527
00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:08.280
me see. Johnny, Johnny, Johnny Carson.
I, this has been another,

528
00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:14.940
another episode of the, the
Connery minutes. I, I did

529
00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:17.760
not. I did not know
that. That is, that is

530
00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:24.670
pretty fantastic. Thank you. A
Rob Connery. It was Connor

531
00:28:24.670 --> 00:28:30.440
Connery minutes. It was funny.
It was Jewish. What about

532
00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:35.820
Sean Connery? The only, the
only only oppression I can

533
00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:43.230
do is again, I've tried
that Orin Orin again. They

534
00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:50.520
redeem that's what makes me
want to cry? This podcast

535
00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:54.150
is making me more stupid.
This podcast. It's time to

536
00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:59.820
stop. Make it stop. All
right, goodbye.
