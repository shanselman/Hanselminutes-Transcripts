11
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.240
is Scott Hanselman. This is
another Hansel minutes. And today

12
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.350
I'm talking with Nancy from
Canada. You are a senior

13
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.840
it security analyst. You work
for the government. That sounds

14
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.570
like a big deal. It
is, it is. It's a

15
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.880
fun thing. I've been in
the government since the beginning

16
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.270
of my career. So it's
definitely a fun place to

17
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.270
work where there's a lot
of challenges and I try

18
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.790
to help and do, do
what I can to help.

19
00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.690
And you work on things
like the security assessment and

20
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.050
authorization programs and making sure
that, you know, information systems

21
00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.530
are secure. And I learned
about you when I was

22
00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.820
learning about the open web
application security project, which I

23
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.100
think a lot of people
who are listening will know

24
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.760
as Oh wasp, they will
C O w a S

25
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.490
P in all caps. And
they usually see this like

26
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.580
once a year. I think
regular people think about OSTP

27
00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.120
once a year. Why is
that? Yes. Well, because we're

28
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.750
known for the O us
top 10 list and the

29
00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.740
top 10 list actually comes
out every three years. Yes.

30
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.590
It comes out every three
years and it's a list

31
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.640
of vulnerabilities ways your applications
can be vulnerable. So it's

32
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.600
an awareness piece. It's not
comprehensive, but it's to remind

33
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.260
people that applications are, are
vulnerable and that you may

34
00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.310
have firewalls. You may have
a great infrastructures, but you

35
00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.520
are still vulnerable if you
have application. And these are

36
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.340
the top 10 ways how
you are vulnerable. So it's

37
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.840
an awareness piece. It's almost
a scare tactic to let

38
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.420
you know that you need
to look at your application

39
00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.740
and start building them securely.
Yeah. It's a big deal.

40
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.330
When I, when you look
at it, there's actually a

41
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.910
wasp on the front, like
of the one from 2013,

42
00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.200
there's like a picture of
a loss, but it's just

43
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.080
like, and then it says
hop 10. And it's a

44
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.840
whole list of like a,
it almost reads as like

45
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.820
a document of shame because
I'm looking at it going,

46
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.980
Oh gosh, I didn't do
that attack back there. And

47
00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.690
I didn't think about that.
Yes. I've been starting to

48
00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.370
talk about it as if
you were going to the

49
00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.500
doctor and he wants to
shock you into thinking about

50
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.130
your health. So he's going
to tell you about, do

51
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.480
you know what you could
capture all the diseases and

52
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.100
that thought things like that,
it's all their vulnerabilities, all

53
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.660
your apps, other vulnerable vulnerabilities
that your apps could have,

54
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.990
but then it's not enough,
right? It's not enough to

55
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:18.700
scare you it to, to
make you think that it's

56
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.370
important. You need an action
plan. You need something to

57
00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.000
do after that. Once you
realize that that you are

58
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.660
vulnerable. So you, you, you
have to come up with

59
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.820
a plan. And that's what
I'd like to talk about.

60
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.090
All the other projects that
can help you build great

61
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.720
application and great software, and
that we have also at

62
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.340
Owasso. And the first piece
is called the proactive controls,

63
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.070
which is the sister document
of, of the top 10.

64
00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:50.350
It's telling you well, before
you to have a, a

65
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.350
great program to build secure
application, here are the 10

66
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.080
controls that you should think
about when you're building software.

67
00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.220
And that's also is not
comprehensive. That also is an

68
00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.340
awareness piece, but it's a
more positive one to, to

69
00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.000
encourage you to take action.
So I would really encourage

70
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.430
people. I know that the
top 10 is very popular

71
00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.840
and some people take it
as a framework, but really

72
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.890
important is, is to take
the overall picture of your

73
00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.710
program and make it better.
And that I think the

74
00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:23.880
way to start is a
proactive controls. Yeah. I think

75
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.360
that the top 10 critical
application security risks, the OSHA

76
00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.700
top 10 has become so
popular that it overshadows the

77
00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.670
important things. And I'm hearing
you say that the top

78
00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.820
10 is really, you know,
reactive. If you've got yourself

79
00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.730
in a situation like that
already, maybe you didn't be

80
00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:42.720
proactive and have the control.
Exactly. And it does have

81
00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.370
the top thing. I don't
want to criticize too much

82
00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.060
stops because it does have
important information. It's not only,

83
00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.800
it's not only a less,
if you go into the

84
00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.970
document, it actually defines the,
the vulnerability where you can

85
00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.760
find it, how you can
fix it and reference other

86
00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.120
documents with an auth that
can help you. So it's

87
00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.850
again, an awareness piece to
let you know, Hey, this

88
00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.510
is important. You're building software.
Let's make sure that, that

89
00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.890
you're not that you're building
Nancy, building them securely and

90
00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.680
go to those other documents
that we have. Those other

91
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.470
projects I know office can
help you do that. And

92
00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.740
that's what I want people
to know about the proactive

93
00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.890
controls is definitely one of
them. And if you go

94
00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:26.850
into the proactive controls, the
first requirement or the first

95
00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:30.810
control is as defined security
requirement. I don't know if

96
00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:35.340
you've heard, if you and
multiple security talks, you'll hear

97
00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.790
to shift left, push left
to think about security early

98
00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:44.340
on in your software life
lifecycle. Well, the first requirement

99
00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.400
is to define the re
the first control is to

100
00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.400
define requirements. And we also
have a list that helps

101
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.940
you go deeper, which is
called ASVs. I forget now,

102
00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:58.670
what is that? An application
security verification. And that's the

103
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:01.910
list of hundreds of controls
that goes into different categories

104
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:07.070
on, on how to build
secure software. So it doesn't

105
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:10.100
want, it wouldn't be the
document you would start with

106
00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:15.080
because it's so comprehensive and
it has so many controls,

107
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:17.720
but it's definitely a document
that you want as a

108
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:22.300
reference to start building secure
software. <inaudible> yeah, I'm looking

109
00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:26.590
at the, the act proactive
controls and reading through this.

110
00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.050
And I'm realizing that honestly,
I I'm a little bit

111
00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:31.870
ashamed all this time. I've
been reading the top 10

112
00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.180
<inaudible> and at the bottom
of every single one of

113
00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:39.370
them is references and links
to specific CWE entries, specific

114
00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:42.910
cheat sheets, specific development, and
testing guides all this time.

115
00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:46.480
This huge like resource has
been underneath me. And I

116
00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.250
was just skimming a top
10 list. So I'm a

117
00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:50.830
little bit, It's true. And
you're not the only one

118
00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:54.430
vendors are referencing it all
the time, either talking about

119
00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:57.640
it to scare, but they
don't really read all the

120
00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.250
details. And there's a lot
of information and it referenced

121
00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:03.460
other documentation that you can
leverage. And you've mentioned the

122
00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:07.330
cheat sheet. This is my
favorite project, because I think

123
00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:12.040
it's rappers out here. They
have about 60 cheat sheets

124
00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:14.650
on different topics. And you
can really go deep and

125
00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:16.780
say, okay, I want to
learn more. I've heard that

126
00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:19.330
session management is a thing,
well, this is cheat sheet

127
00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:23.800
for that. And it defines
what session management is, why

128
00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:27.100
you should care and what
to do about it. And

129
00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:31.840
you can really focus in
focus on a topic specifically,

130
00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:35.230
and it can be also
language specific. So I would

131
00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:37.840
really encourage people to go
through the cheat sheet and

132
00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:41.590
find the ones that are
relevant to them and find

133
00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:46.870
applicable ways to, to, to,
to take D the advice

134
00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:49.690
to heart. I'm noticing also,
one of the things that

135
00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:52.570
I didn't realize is that
OSP the, both the top

136
00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:56.020
10 and the other documents
look backwards in time and

137
00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:59.230
show you what's changed. So
like things that have merged

138
00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:03.040
moving forward, things that have
become easy to solve against

139
00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.500
that may have been difficult
in the past. Things like

140
00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:08.530
insufficient transport layer protection go
from being a major risk

141
00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:12.010
to being something that's kind
of a standard today. Yes,

142
00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:15.430
yes. And one of the
practice control, I believe is

143
00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:20.620
number two. I believe it's
to use secure frameworks, right?

144
00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:25.630
Sometimes just by choosing the
correct tools you are covered,

145
00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:29.590
right? Sometimes it's old technologies,
old, all the ways of

146
00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:32.830
doing things that make you
formidable. And just by updating,

147
00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:36.640
just by patching, just by
using something modern, you take

148
00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:40.720
care of a lot of
things. So it's, it's a

149
00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.970
good thing to, to look
at that as well to

150
00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:45.460
say, Hey, maybe I'm not
even vulnerable to these things.

151
00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:48.220
And also that it's a
living document. That's why we

152
00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:52.270
update it every three years
and it could be useful

153
00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:55.440
every year, but it's a
huge effort. So every three

154
00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:00.420
years we go into the
community, ask for their opinion

155
00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:02.550
on what should be on
the list, what date they've

156
00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:06.750
seen in their software. And
it changes because in 2013,

157
00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:09.630
and now in 2000, and
the latest version is from

158
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:13.050
2017 and there'll be a
new one in 2020. And

159
00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:18.780
the list will probably be
different hopefully, but injections has

160
00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:21.510
been on the list forever.
I think since the inception

161
00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:24.510
of, of the top 10.
So sometimes the problems we

162
00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:27.950
know about are not that
easy to fix. Yeah. One

163
00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:29.390
of the things that I
really like about the way

164
00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:32.450
that OSTP expresses all of
these different things is it

165
00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:37.640
has the AWSP risk rating
methodology that talks about the,

166
00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:40.460
the, the threat agents, the
attack vectors, and whether they're

167
00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:42.860
easy or hard. So then
you can make a decision

168
00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:45.650
when you're trying to secure
application about whether something is

169
00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:48.560
really prevalent and you have
to balance all of these

170
00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:51.350
things, its impact, its detectability
and how hard it is

171
00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:53.090
or how easy it is
for someone to actually try

172
00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:57.170
to exploit it. Yes, it's
very important in everything, all

173
00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:58.850
the controls that you want
to apply, you want to

174
00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:02.120
prioritize it. You can't, some,
you can't sometimes do it

175
00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:04.550
all and you want to
be able to find a

176
00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:07.370
way to prioritize on what
you want to work on.

177
00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:10.340
And that information helps you
saying, okay, maybe we should

178
00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:13.640
focus on that. And instead
of doing a lot of

179
00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:17.330
things poorly, let's focus on
the, the, the vulnerability that

180
00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:20.870
maybe if we fix would
have the most impact. Sometimes

181
00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:24.260
when I go and see
presentations on security, it becomes

182
00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.260
overwhelming. Like I realized that
covering my eyes and saying,

183
00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.870
this is too scary to
think about is this bad,

184
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:32.180
but don't, you feel completely
overwhelmed. I mean, we're being

185
00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:36.560
attacked from all directions constantly.
Absolutely. As I feel that

186
00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:39.380
I feel the same way
and that's, that's when I

187
00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:42.500
need to stop and say,
okay, let's see what you

188
00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:46.700
can do that has the
most impact and stop thinking

189
00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:50.930
that you'll fix everything. Cause
you, you can't, but focus

190
00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.180
on what will have the
most impact and try to

191
00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:57.350
find repeatable ways to fix
issues. And that's all you

192
00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:00.140
can do. Well, I, when
we think about being proactive,

193
00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:02.330
so if we, if we
think about the proactive controls,

194
00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:05.030
some of these things we've
been told for many years,

195
00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:08.600
like it says 2018, cause
it's quite fresh, but validate

196
00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:12.200
inputs in code and escape
data. I was definitely encoding

197
00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.690
and escaping data 20 years
ago, but we still see

198
00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:19.130
these mistakes today. Yeah. But
I also think, cause I'm

199
00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:22.550
involved. Well, I I'm involved
in my own chapter here

200
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:27.020
in Ottawa and we're hosting
a secure coding workshop for

201
00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:30.950
the Ottawa university because we
realized that in you can

202
00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:35.390
graduate from a computer science
degree with a computer science

203
00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:39.440
degree and never have a
class on secure coding. So

204
00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:42.740
even if those things, sometimes
I think everybody knows what

205
00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:44.660
I know because I'm involved
in a loss and I

206
00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:47.570
hear it all the time.
But if you actually talk

207
00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:50.510
to people who learn how
to code, it's not something

208
00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:54.340
that they've been taught so
needs to be repeated and

209
00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:57.460
it needs to be, we
need to stop talking to

210
00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:00.730
other security professionals or people
that already know and say,

211
00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:04.690
yes, yes, yes. But go
to, I'll go to security

212
00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:08.620
conferences to tell people to
shift laughter or to use

213
00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:10.810
tool from OSTP. But we
need to be with the

214
00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:14.650
devs, go to development conferences
and talk about these things.

215
00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:18.370
I think we need to
stop talking to other security

216
00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:21.880
professionals about what to do,
because we know the, to

217
00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:23.800
make sure that the people
that need to know that

218
00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:26.530
are actually applying these things
need to know about that

219
00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:30.480
as well. Sick of waiting
for your CIA test to

220
00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:33.480
pass or having to manage
different CII servers for different

221
00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:37.530
teams using Buildkite. You can
run fast and reliable CIA

222
00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:41.400
pipelines for every type of
project, whether it's backend tests,

223
00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:44.700
mobile apps, or even custom
hardware build kites agent helps

224
00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:47.850
you scale to thousands of
parallel jobs and your secrets

225
00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:51.780
and source code never leave
your infrastructure. There's great documentation,

226
00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:54.720
a clean web UI and
plugins for different types of

227
00:12:54.720 --> 00:13:00.630
tools visit Buildkite that's K
I T e.com/hanselman for a

228
00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:04.050
14 day free trial and
see how Shopify has scaled

229
00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:08.100
from 300 to 1500 engineers
while keeping their build times

230
00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:15.120
under five minutes, that's built
kite.com/hanselman. Let's dig a little

231
00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:16.980
bit more into shift left.
You mentioned it at the

232
00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:20.430
beginning. And I think that
not everyone understands it. And

233
00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:23.250
for some people who might
be not have English as

234
00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:27.240
their first language shift left
is kind of confusing. What

235
00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.100
are we sh what is,
how things work today and

236
00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:30.660
what are we shifting to
the left when it comes

237
00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:34.050
to the software development model?
Okay. So when we're developing

238
00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:38.070
software, you know, the, the
life cycle starts with, you

239
00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:44.640
know, the idea and then
having security or requirements for

240
00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:46.860
your, for your idea. And
then you go into development.

241
00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:49.800
So we, you start from
the left to the right

242
00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:53.730
and complete your project. And
often we only think about

243
00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:56.880
security once you're at the
end of a project, and

244
00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:01.080
that's not that doesn't help
you because it will cost

245
00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:04.170
you a lot more in
energy and resources and money

246
00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:06.810
to fix something. Once you're
at the end of this

247
00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:09.660
project. So we're trying to
start that the beginning, which

248
00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:13.440
is at the left of
the life cycle at the

249
00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:16.830
beginning of the life cycle,
where you, you put your,

250
00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:21.840
you asked for your security
requirement, it's basically asking someone

251
00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:25.620
to pass a test, but
only giving them, you know,

252
00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:28.050
what they should have studied
for at the end of

253
00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:30.690
the test. It's not fair.
Why are you telling me

254
00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:34.890
what to fix in my
application? Only at the end,

255
00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:37.860
when I finished building everything,
if I had known these

256
00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:40.830
things at the beginning, well,
I would have designed my

257
00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:44.610
solution differently, but we're not
that great at doing that

258
00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:47.670
because I've heard of shift
left, but at least 15

259
00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:50.670
years ago, and probably before
that as well. That's a

260
00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:53.030
really great though. I'm thinking
about If I've had someone

261
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:55.040
build a house and the
house is beautiful and we're

262
00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:58.070
about to move the new
family into the house. And

263
00:14:58.070 --> 00:15:01.970
we say, Oh, we need
locks. You're like, Oh, locks,

264
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.800
Oh, I'm gonna have to
redesign the doors and the

265
00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:06.440
walls near the doors. And
like the windows and like

266
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:08.720
locks. I wish you told
me about locks when we

267
00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:12.550
built the house. Gosh. Yeah.
Or even worse, like adding

268
00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:15.910
suddenly saying, Oh, where I
have five children. Maybe I

269
00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:20.920
need another bathroom. Yes. We
can make it happen. But

270
00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:24.700
it's going to be awkward.
We might have to move

271
00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:27.490
a room and make a
room smaller and then add

272
00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:29.980
a wall where it wasn't
meant to be a wall

273
00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:33.130
and then things. And you're
destroying things that were not

274
00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:36.280
broken, but you know, because
of your, you last minute

275
00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:39.970
design, you need to move.
That is expensive and it's

276
00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:44.470
not pretty either. It might
look awkward. It's clunky. Yeah.

277
00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:46.990
And, and, and I'll put
it in the link in

278
00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:49.600
the show notes. There's a
report from IBM that says

279
00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:52.180
that if you find a
defect like that, especially as

280
00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:54.700
security defect, it can be
like a hundred times more

281
00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:57.910
expensive to fix if we're
in maintenance as opposed to

282
00:15:57.910 --> 00:16:03.100
when you're in design. Absolutely.
Absolutely. But it's, it's something

283
00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:05.910
easy to say. You know,
I've heard shift left before,

284
00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:10.630
but it's funny how we
have a hard time doing

285
00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:15.250
that in practice. It's a
SP especially when things are

286
00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:20.770
being built very quickly and
DevOps and agile, we were

287
00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:24.310
having a hard time putting
the security requirements in a

288
00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:27.820
waterfall environment where things were
a bit slower and more

289
00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:32.830
predictable. Now they're asking us
to go even faster and

290
00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:36.280
security has a hard time
to catch up <inaudible> and

291
00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:38.380
I also want to call
out again that you mentioned

292
00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:41.350
you're in your local chapter.
And if we go up

293
00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:44.140
and search for OSB, local
chapters, there's this wonderful Google

294
00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:47.080
map. There are hundreds of
chapters all over the place,

295
00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:50.830
hopefully one near you. If
you're listening and you go

296
00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:53.290
actually, and you can start
your own local chapter and

297
00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:57.070
find speakers and, and, and
get involved. Yes. The last

298
00:16:57.070 --> 00:17:01.210
time I checked, I believe
there was 221 chapters in

299
00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:05.020
the world globally. And 67
of them were in the

300
00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:09.490
U S and six active
chapters in Canada. And every

301
00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:13.450
week, every month, new chapters
are being, are being created

302
00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:16.560
around the world. And that's
one entry point to, to

303
00:17:16.570 --> 00:17:19.390
get involved with us, but
you can also get involved

304
00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:22.540
within projects. There's a bunch
of open source projects and

305
00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:25.660
the projects I spend time
talking about the proactive control,

306
00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:30.730
top 10, those are very
mature projects with clear processes

307
00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:34.330
and repeatable and a good
team. And they're called flagship

308
00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:37.150
projects, but there's a bunch
of other projects that are

309
00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:42.580
in incubator, incubators or labs
that are, you know, not

310
00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:45.940
flagship, not as mature, but
where we're doing really, really

311
00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:51.720
interesting stuff, right. And building
tools and experimenting. And I

312
00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:53.580
would really encourage you to
go through that list of

313
00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:55.860
project and see if there's
something that's interesting to you

314
00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:59.810
and if you would want
to, to contribute. And it's

315
00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:03.110
also important to point out
that <inaudible> is a worldwide

316
00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:07.700
nonprofit. So everything is free.
The materials are free. There's

317
00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:10.970
not any endorsements. This is
not a commercial entity. That's

318
00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:13.040
trying to sell anyone. Anything.
Anyone who wants to get

319
00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:17.060
involved can get involved. Absolutely
not. We really have to

320
00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:20.000
police that. However, there's a
lot of businesses that wanted

321
00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:23.240
to rub shoulders with us,
but we are a nonprofit

322
00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:28.250
and we don't endorse any
specific businesses. For sure. I

323
00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:31.100
have a bunch of sponsors
because we have conferences at

324
00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:36.890
least two to four conferences,
global conferences every year, that

325
00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:41.510
where, where you can get
to meet a bunch of

326
00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:44.480
members of the community and
get access to training at

327
00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:47.930
very reasonable prices and a
bunch of 'em and get

328
00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:52.130
introduced to new projects as
well. And different talks about

329
00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:55.400
application security. Is this a
good place for someone who

330
00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.530
is interested and maybe they're
a student, or they want

331
00:18:57.530 --> 00:19:00.340
to move into information, security
is going to their own

332
00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:02.390
local chapter, a good place
for them to get started

333
00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:06.470
in their career as well.
Absolutely. Yes. Depending on the

334
00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:10.910
chapter there ran a bit
independently, but you can often

335
00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:13.310
find mentors at that's where
I've found one of my

336
00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:16.670
mentors and where, how I
changed department within the government

337
00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:19.530
once was by meeting my,
my boss at a no

338
00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:26.120
loss chapter meeting. So definitely
getting involved in your chapter

339
00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:28.340
as a, as a good
way to get started. And

340
00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:31.370
it's fun and they have
pizza and pop for free

341
00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:35.030
and a bunch of information.
So why not? Why not?

342
00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:38.120
Another thing that I think
is really cool about you,

343
00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:39.860
that I've when I searched
around and learn about what

344
00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:43.670
you do is that you
love certifications. You've got a

345
00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:47.000
bunch of sort of in
addition to your other bona

346
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.440
Fides. And do you feel
that certifications are important to

347
00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:54.050
young people? Cause I constantly
get people asking on Twitter.

348
00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:56.480
If they think that a
certification will help them get

349
00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:00.110
that next job or that
next opportunity. Well, there are

350
00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:04.520
multiple reasons for someone to
get certification and for sure,

351
00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:10.280
for certain jobs, especially consultants
and in Canada, I can

352
00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:14.840
speak to for Canada for
consultant, the CISP for example,

353
00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:18.680
certification is essential because it
gives you points in the

354
00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:21.500
competition to make sure that
you get that contract. So

355
00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:27.650
it can be somewhere to
a checkpoint for, for HR,

356
00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:32.690
right? But it's not only
that it's also a good

357
00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:36.770
way to get started too,
in a different topic that

358
00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:39.590
you might not have learned
in school, but you know,

359
00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:43.550
you want to learn you,
you want to invest security,

360
00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:46.100
but never, never had a
class for it. And you're

361
00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:48.970
out of school, then that's
a good way to transition

362
00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:51.910
and to enter the topic
and get the basics and

363
00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:55.780
get your security plus and
get. And now there's different

364
00:20:56.560 --> 00:21:00.940
certification about cloud and about
Kubernetes. And they're getting more

365
00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:05.560
and more hands on there.
It's no longer about learning

366
00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:11.110
a bunch of definitions and
learning question dumps, answer, and

367
00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:14.620
then going through a tests
it's really practical and hands

368
00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:17.530
on learning and something I
say that might not be

369
00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:19.360
applicable in the U S
but in Canada as well,

370
00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:22.060
is that you're going to
search for the certification for

371
00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:24.730
the skills. So you can
go through the curriculum without

372
00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:27.640
having to go for the
test. Cause I do understand

373
00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:30.900
it. It is expensive to
get a certification, sometimes a

374
00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:33.190
other material to learn, to
go through the test and

375
00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:36.040
then the maintenance fees. If
you don't need it, if

376
00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:37.990
it's not, if you don't
need it as a job

377
00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:42.400
requirement, and it's not a
indie HR checklist, go through

378
00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:45.070
the material, learn what you
need to learn and move

379
00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:48.010
on to something else. I
think it's, you don't have

380
00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:50.230
to reinvent the wheel. It's
a way to, to get

381
00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:52.920
started on a new topic.
So it sounds like it's

382
00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:56.550
not the perfect answer for
someone who maybe doesn't have

383
00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:59.370
a degree or a background,
but it is a checklist,

384
00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:01.500
a check box on the,
on the, on the, on

385
00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:03.870
the way on the way
forward. I think sometimes people

386
00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:06.780
think that it's sort of
certification will unlock an opportunity

387
00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:10.410
that a, it wouldn't have
unlocked without it. Sometimes it

388
00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:14.190
does put your, your CV
on top of the list

389
00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:16.700
to show that you have
an interest, especially if you

390
00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:20.250
graduated from a CS degree.
And then on top of

391
00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:22.740
that, you, you went for
certification. It shows that you

392
00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:26.280
have continued interest in, in
your profession and you're investing

393
00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:31.170
in your education. So it
it's a differentiator. You can

394
00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.390
get on top of the
list, but it doesn't mean

395
00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:37.650
that you, because you have
a certification that you automatically

396
00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:41.250
get a job and a
good HR process. We'll know

397
00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:46.380
if you only have certification,
but don't practice. You don't

398
00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:48.780
have hands on experience. They,
they will find out really

399
00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:53.010
clear really quickly. Now you
have a program that you're

400
00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:56.460
trying out in Canada called
secure this cert, can you

401
00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:59.670
tell me about that? Yes.
Yes. Well, like you said,

402
00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:02.850
I'm a bit obsessed with
certification and they are expensive.

403
00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:07.350
So me and Jenny gay,
my co founder for secure

404
00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:11.700
that cert, we S we
started a community where we

405
00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:14.100
gather people. We have a
meet up group and we

406
00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:16.350
ask people who want to
come and study with us

407
00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:19.530
for a different type of
certification. And we have, we

408
00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:24.900
run three groups to this
semester, the security plus CIS

409
00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:29.400
CSP. And we started to
pen testing fundamentals and sort

410
00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:32.000
of people that, you know,
want to get started in

411
00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:35.040
a new topic or in
their studies. They've been talking

412
00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:37.380
about it, but they need
the accountability. Cause you can

413
00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:42.090
always do self study, but
starting alone, sometimes it's intimidating.

414
00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:44.310
You don't know where to
start. Well, we have a

415
00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:47.060
game plan. We, we have
a schedule, we have a

416
00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:49.400
curriculum, we know what we'll
do every night. And we

417
00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:53.450
meet once a week for
10, 12 or 16 weeks,

418
00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:55.850
depending on the curriculum. And
we go through the material

419
00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:58.340
and we have quiz questions
and we go through them

420
00:23:58.550 --> 00:24:04.130
and hands-on examples. So it's
the support and accountability and

421
00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:07.370
guidance that you need sometimes
to, to move forward. If,

422
00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:09.500
if you're unable to do
it on your own or,

423
00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:13.720
or doesn't, don't have the
motivation, It seems like you're

424
00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:16.420
a big proponent of community
and allowing people to, and

425
00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:19.630
encouraging people to get in,
get involved. I'm, I'm hearing

426
00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:22.660
everything that you're talking about
is about groups and community

427
00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:24.940
and people coming together to
make something bigger that they

428
00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:27.460
couldn't do just by themselves.
It sounds like you don't

429
00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:29.650
want people to just be
studying alone in their, in

430
00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:32.200
their home to try to
pass all these tests. Yes.

431
00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:35.350
Well, because you, you don't
get challenged really. You don't

432
00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:37.870
get exposed. I feel like
it's, it's a bit like

433
00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:40.630
traveling where you, you think,
you know it all when

434
00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:43.030
you're alone with your book
and you're like, yes, I

435
00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:46.690
understand it. But when you
actually are able to teach

436
00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:49.120
it to someone else or
listen to someone else, explain

437
00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:53.080
it to you with a
different perspective, suddenly you see

438
00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:56.920
you have a different perspective.
Exactly. And he learned a

439
00:24:56.920 --> 00:25:00.700
lot more. And part of
the study group is teaching

440
00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:03.850
to others as well. Right.
And we, we know that

441
00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:06.940
when we take the time
to understand the material well,

442
00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:09.010
enough to be able to
teach it to somebody else,

443
00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:11.590
you understand a lot more
what you're doing and what

444
00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:16.210
you're trying to, to aren't.
So, yeah. Have you been

445
00:25:16.270 --> 00:25:19.270
as active in community the
entire time of your career?

446
00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:21.520
Or did you like, did
you come into it and

447
00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:23.740
software and security and go,
Oh, I'm going to find

448
00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:25.870
a community or did you
discover it part of the

449
00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:31.660
way in your journey? I
discovered it when I I'm

450
00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:34.450
trying to think back, I
guess. So it was when

451
00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:36.400
I joined security, when I
moved that actually for my

452
00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:40.210
first security job, I moved
from Montreal to Ottawa. And

453
00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:46.600
my first event was an
ISA information system, security association

454
00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:49.090
chapter. We had one in
Ottawa and I got involved

455
00:25:50.130 --> 00:25:54.430
in that. And from there
I discovered other group and

456
00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:59.980
then London on Oahu where
I, I, I volunteered most

457
00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:03.850
of my time and also
secure that search. So yeah,

458
00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:06.670
w once I discovered it,
maybe a bit later in

459
00:26:06.670 --> 00:26:10.030
my career, I didn't stop
and I'm very, very involved

460
00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:13.090
and I feel like it
keeps me motivated and, and

461
00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:17.290
makes it fun. Right. I
don't think that, eh, it

462
00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:20.020
should be all worked and
you can learn and still

463
00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:22.810
have fun. Do you think
that this is something that

464
00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:24.940
everyone can do? It sounds
like you found that natural.

465
00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:26.680
A lot of people struggle
to get any, to get

466
00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:30.250
involved when, when you and
I hear on our podcasts

467
00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:32.440
say, Oh, well, you should
just go to a meetup.

468
00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:37.720
It'll be great. That can
be Yes. Sure. And, you

469
00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:40.390
know, you find your tribe,
you find your community and

470
00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:42.400
you try it out and
see if it fits you.

471
00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:45.670
And it might, and it
might not, you know, and,

472
00:26:45.670 --> 00:26:48.480
and it's okay. But like
I said earlier, there's other

473
00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:51.390
ways to get involved. If
you're more of an introvert

474
00:26:51.390 --> 00:26:53.580
and don't want to go
out there, you can get

475
00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:56.140
involved in a project and
you don't have to leave

476
00:26:56.160 --> 00:27:00.660
your house for that just
goes through the, the inventory

477
00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:02.910
of all the projects and
see where you want to,

478
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.120
all the projects, won't help
all the projects won't volunteer.

479
00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:10.440
So just see what what's
good for you. What's interesting

480
00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:12.900
to you and, and contribute.
And that's the way to

481
00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:15.690
build the community online as
well, and not having to

482
00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:18.350
go out there. I think
that's a really important reminder.

483
00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:19.970
I think that was an
important reminder. I think that

484
00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:22.490
sometimes people think that like,
well, if I don't have

485
00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:25.160
the ability to take your,
get repository and clone it,

486
00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:27.110
build it, fix it and
send a pull request in

487
00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:29.900
an hour. Then I'm not
a good community member, but

488
00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:34.550
documentation organizing mailing lists, there's
so much to be done

489
00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:37.700
that can be done from
your home for free And

490
00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:40.970
different skillset as well. So,
and so many project calls

491
00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:44.120
also at OSF, I notice
are, are led by very

492
00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:47.210
technical people that might not
have a, you know, the

493
00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:51.320
marketing skills needed to, to
let people know about their

494
00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:54.470
projects, about what they offer
or a, you know, social

495
00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:59.210
media or documentation or copywriting.
So if these are things

496
00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:02.360
that you're good at, you
can definitely reach out to

497
00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:06.050
a project and, and say,
Hey, I want to help

498
00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:09.590
you doing that. And just
within my community, within my

499
00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:14.990
chapter, the chapter leader, no,
the project leader of the

500
00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:18.380
secure coding dojo, which is
a platform where you learn

501
00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:23.420
to code securely, you know,
he's busy building the platform.

502
00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:26.960
And I volunteered to, to,
to start the event to

503
00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:29.210
start our workshop and say,
Hey, within the community, we

504
00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:32.270
could have a workshop. So
you can, I know that

505
00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:34.850
I have, I have those
skills that I can compliment

506
00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:38.420
other people's skills and create
events for my community. So

507
00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:40.550
get involved in a way
when you see a need

508
00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:45.800
asking and contribute. For sure.
That's really cool. I appreciate

509
00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:48.440
that. That you're, you're just
telling us that OA has

510
00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:51.380
been, the security community can
be very welcoming forward for

511
00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:53.810
both new people, but also
for people who might have

512
00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:57.020
five, 10, 20 years in,
in their industry, but they

513
00:28:57.020 --> 00:29:00.050
maybe haven't yet discovered their
tribe, the encouragement to kind

514
00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:01.760
of go out there and
try to find your tribe

515
00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:06.050
is so important. Yes, yes.
And if it doesn't work

516
00:29:06.050 --> 00:29:08.390
the first time, it doesn't
mean that it won't work

517
00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:11.660
every time. And that there
are different projects to get

518
00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:14.990
involved and there are different
groups you can get involved

519
00:29:15.050 --> 00:29:19.040
in. So of course, you
know, when you're there, it's

520
00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:22.880
a bunch of volunteers or
passionate people sometimes, you know,

521
00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:26.300
they're the environment. You, you
can fall into a group.

522
00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:29.510
That's not that, you know,
encouraging, but that's an mean

523
00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:32.690
that it represents the whole
community. Either you just move

524
00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:37.010
along, you, there definitely are
opportunities to focus on the

525
00:29:37.010 --> 00:29:40.580
work, focus on technology and,
and stay away from the

526
00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:44.200
drama. Yeah, definitely. And I
liked the idea of work,

527
00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:47.320
study groups, the idea that
getting some people together and

528
00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:50.220
studying, we've all done this
before in school, you get

529
00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:52.990
a work study group together
and you're describing effectively the

530
00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:56.260
same thing. And it doesn't
have to be like, people

531
00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:57.940
don't have to be sad
if they tweet and a

532
00:29:57.940 --> 00:30:00.790
hundred people don't show up
five people, 10 people in

533
00:30:00.790 --> 00:30:03.610
a group around a table
studying to pass the certification.

534
00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:07.980
It can be hugely impactful.
Absolutely. Yeah. And our groups

535
00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:11.070
are not huge. I'm thinking
less than a dozen. And

536
00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:13.050
you know, the maximum, I
think in a group is

537
00:30:13.050 --> 00:30:16.980
14. And it's not about
how many people we are.

538
00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:20.460
I just want people that
are focused com committed. And,

539
00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:23.640
you know, w we know
we notice when somebody doesn't

540
00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:26.370
show up, right? It's not
just like a meetup where,

541
00:30:26.970 --> 00:30:29.220
you know, you can RSVP
and not show up. No,

542
00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:32.790
you, you have a responsibility.
We, we count on you

543
00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:36.930
to present your section of,
of the curriculum. So yeah.

544
00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:41.280
Th people build relationships and,
and are very close at

545
00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:44.790
the end of their, their
study groups. That's fantastic. It's

546
00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:47.220
so nice to hear that,
that, it's nice for me

547
00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:50.010
to learn, frankly, that Oahu
is so much more than

548
00:30:50.010 --> 00:30:52.980
this top 10 list that
I was reading every, every,

549
00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:56.160
every three years. It's, that's
the tip of the iceberg.

550
00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:59.670
And there's a huge, huge
community, thousands and thousands of

551
00:30:59.670 --> 00:31:02.940
members, hundreds of meetups, dozens,
and dozens, and dozens of

552
00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:05.790
projects, all of which looking
for help that hopefully our

553
00:31:05.790 --> 00:31:08.670
listeners will w will be
encouraged and go and get

554
00:31:08.670 --> 00:31:11.820
involved. Yes. Yes. And I
want to clarify that secure,

555
00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:13.920
that sort of, what I
do with certification is different

556
00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:19.050
from us. I met, I'm
a very, very active member

557
00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:22.500
volunteer at a wasp, but
secure that. So it's something

558
00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:25.500
I do on the side,
but yes, please go on

559
00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:28.380
the website on our Wiki
and check out the chapter.

560
00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:31.680
That's closest to you start
one. If, if you don't

561
00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:33.900
have one close to you,
and I even believe that

562
00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:37.590
there's a virtual chapter where
they host meeting online all

563
00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:41.970
the time. So yeah. Shake
it out. And if it's

564
00:31:41.970 --> 00:31:45.600
more the documentation or the
projects I'm going to, not

565
00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:48.540
only the flagship project, but
the incubator and the labs

566
00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:51.840
project that might need help.
And there are more experimental

567
00:31:51.930 --> 00:31:54.030
there. There's a lot of
fence stuff to play around

568
00:31:54.030 --> 00:31:57.120
with. Very cool. Well, thank
you so much, Nancy Guy, Shay

569
00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:00.780
for chatting with me today,
this has been another episode

570
00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:14.610
of Hanselminutes and we'll see
you again next week. <inaudible>.
