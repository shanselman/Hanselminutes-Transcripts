Scott talks with Sebastian Lamplugh

8
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.380
about practical rest. Hi, this
is Scott Hanselman. This is

9
00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.420
another episode of Hansel minutes
and on the phone right

10
00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.020
now, we've got Sebastian. Llandeilo
also known as serial Seb.

11
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.320
How are you, sir? I'm
very well. Thanks for having

12
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.600
me. Oh my pleasure. My
pleasure. You are a young,

13
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:12.950
a young person, but I
was just going to call

14
00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.410
you the wise old man
of arrest. Cause you've been

15
00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.070
talking about rest before I
even was familiar with the

16
00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.410
topic you've been working in
restaurants since the very beginning.

17
00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.290
Haven't you? Not at the
beginning, but I think I

18
00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.630
was formalizing ideas around, around
web technologies all the way

19
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.980
back in 2003, 2004. And
I stumbled upon rest on

20
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.290
late 2004, early 2005. And
it kind of resolved a

21
00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.830
lot of outstanding questions I
had. So I just got

22
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.990
completely hooked on it. It
was free for the first

23
00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.660
year to now I'm arrested
ethic. <inaudible> I think someone

24
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.900
told me once. Yeah, I'm
not sure. I like the

25
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:59.060
term really, but open Russ,
that was a play on,

26
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.660
on, on the rest of
foreign as a term used

27
00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.440
the term that people use
to use to call themselves

28
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.340
if they were very interested
in rest topic And open

29
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.510
roster is your rest framework,
your service side rest framework.

30
00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.080
I think it's, it's difficult
to qualify it as rest.

31
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.990
The thing it's a resource
oriented framework. So it takes

32
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.570
the ideas that exist in
rest and focusing on one

33
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.900
side of things, which is
to define things with names

34
00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.340
and, and builds a whole
framework around that concept, which

35
00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.980
is quite a different approach
from the MVC approaches that

36
00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.910
existed at the time. Certainly.
So I call it a

37
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.730
resource oriented framework, but you
can call it a rest

38
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.940
framework yet. It's it's close
enough. Well, see, well, that's

39
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.700
actually an interesting thing. So,
so right now we're only

40
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.770
a few minutes in, and
we're talking about rest, but

41
00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:54.470
already we're parsing words and
thinking about, yeah, kind of

42
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.840
like that. It's not quite
like that. What is it

43
00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.950
about rest that brings that
out in that, that, that

44
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.100
sense Of really wanting to
really wanting to define things

45
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.980
and make sure that it's,
that it's correct. And that

46
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.610
it's understood why rest? What
is rest do that? And

47
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.160
other technologies don't Oh, I
think there's, I think there's

48
00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.130
two main reasons. The first
one is rest is really

49
00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.310
the, the way that acknowledge
it. So it's a reflection

50
00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.490
on the way the web
is, is built itself. So

51
00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.530
it has the properties that
the web has. And when

52
00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.150
I talk about the web,
I took the web as,

53
00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.540
as a globality, as all
the servers in the world

54
00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.760
that runs when applications. So
there's a lot of, of

55
00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.010
experience that has been gained
from those web technologies that

56
00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:44.010
rest describes. Now, one of
the problems is that the

57
00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.450
majority of problem, majority of
people building rest applications have

58
00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.150
no idea. They are building
rest applications because they're building

59
00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.360
web applications. Rest is a
reflection on how they built

60
00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.980
those applications and whether the
properties of that system once

61
00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.830
it builds up. So I
think the first thing is,

62
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.440
people don't know they're doing
rest. So they don't know

63
00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.960
the rules. They followed to
build them. They don't know

64
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:12.270
the formalism behind how web
applications are built. So you

65
00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.180
have to w when you,
when you bring in rest

66
00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:17.700
to conversation, you not only
have to bring the knowledge

67
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.590
of rest. You also have
to rework the way people

68
00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.530
think about how they built
their web applications. That's one

69
00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.140
thing. And the other thing
of course is we have

70
00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.880
had a lot of vendors
using the Monica rests as

71
00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.000
opposed to web services. Of
course, it's a completely different,

72
00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.600
a completely different way of
building systems. So it's not

73
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.410
really something that you put
against soap. For example, it's

74
00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.800
not so versus rest, but
people have been using it

75
00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.130
like that. And it went
into product names. Some vendors

76
00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.220
took a long time to
learn what rest really meant.

77
00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.670
And they published a whole
bunch of products that were

78
00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.720
for the rest purist for
the people that really spent

79
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.870
many years learning rests are
in conflict with some of

80
00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.200
the simple rules in rest.
So I think there's, the

81
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.780
community may have been in
the past a little bit

82
00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.040
touchy fee because they have
to find the knowledge that

83
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.040
people think they have and
finds the marketing of the

84
00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.820
vendors. So the two combined
together, especially when you apply

85
00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.910
that to a very small
group of passionate people may

86
00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:29.340
turn sometimes in, you know,
every small cohesive you did

87
00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.400
it wrong kind of thing.
I think we suffered from

88
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.840
that a little bit in
the past. I don't think

89
00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.480
it's the case now, but
I think in the past,

90
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:41.910
yes, I know that's the
term rest purist has been

91
00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:46.290
used a lot. The rest
police and many well known

92
00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:51.120
bloggers have in many occasions
explained how they were being

93
00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.450
pursued by a rep farmers
and the pitchforks when they

94
00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.640
get wrong. I think that
that does not teach you

95
00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.580
that doesn't exist in the
community, but it sets the

96
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.610
need. Then didn't, didn't help
us very much at the

97
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.620
beginning, I would think So.
It sounds like if, if

98
00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:10.360
someone's technology has a fundamental
misunderstanding, that's when the purists

99
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.390
come out, the defenders is
the idea that no you're

100
00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:17.230
misunderstanding something fundamental. And I'm
hearing you say that rest

101
00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:21.130
is a, an architectural pattern
that's built on top of

102
00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:25.420
the web itself. And you're
saying most people don't even

103
00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:28.420
understand how the web itself
works when they're designing systems

104
00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:32.290
for it. Yeah. Yeah. That's
the truth. But that's, that's,

105
00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.920
that's because they are middleware
vendors. If you have to

106
00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.900
rebuild a whole web stack,
every time you build a

107
00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:41.140
website, things would take a
long time. So you are

108
00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:44.620
attracted away, especially on Microsoft
platforms. And again, we're talking

109
00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:48.790
circa 2006 Microsoft platforms where
you had what was web

110
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:52.030
forms. You couldn't be further
from how the web work.

111
00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:55.030
So of course you have
a whole generation of developers

112
00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:57.520
that are not trained on
web technologies. So they don't

113
00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.160
know what they're doing. Of
course they don't. The reason

114
00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.130
for the vendor to exist
is to let them not

115
00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:05.410
learn what they do. And
so they can focus on

116
00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:10.180
resolving business issues. So I
think that that's, that that's

117
00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:13.690
parts of that problem. Yes.
But I think it's getting

118
00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:16.840
better. I think it's getting
much, much better now, especially

119
00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:20.020
on the Microsoft side, there's
a, it's a completely different

120
00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:23.800
new brand, shiny new work.
That's interesting that you say

121
00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:28.840
that because when I started
out, I learned C in

122
00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.570
school and when I did
my first hello world, it

123
00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:37.090
was with Charles Petzold programming
windows book on windows 3.0

124
00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:42.140
3.1. And hello world was
91 lines. So, you know,

125
00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:44.590
you had, you read a
really clear idea of what

126
00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:47.800
was going on. I mean,
I learned all about window

127
00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.320
handles and cleaning up after
myself and all the things

128
00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.810
that are at this, the
bowels of what was then

129
00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:57.160
the windows SDK. And when
I learned visual basic, when

130
00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:01.480
I went into business and
started dragging over buttons onto

131
00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:04.570
the, under the surface, it
wasn't magic to me. I

132
00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:06.310
was like, Oh, okay, I
see what they've done here.

133
00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:09.010
They've just wrapped that. And
Oh, this button has a

134
00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:11.320
window handle. And then I
was able to go and

135
00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:15.550
use some of the low
level VBX cracking software from

136
00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:17.950
people like Dan Appleman. And
I was doing, you know,

137
00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:20.650
crazy owner, draw graphics and
stuff, and everyone else thought

138
00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:25.240
it was amazing because their
foray, their first entrance into

139
00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.030
windows was wait, you drag
a button and then you

140
00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:32.080
double click and then you
have button.click. I think, I

141
00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:34.540
think, I mean, I come
from the completely opposite background.

142
00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:38.290
I started with JavaScript. My
first line of code was

143
00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:42.700
in 1997. I did a
bit of basic and stuff

144
00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:45.310
like that before. But the
first real products that I

145
00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:48.730
tried to launch commercially and
make money off that was

146
00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:53.020
in 97, 98 websites and
escape 1.2. Then we went

147
00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:55.060
all the way to building
a three D engine w

148
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:58.890
with, with JavaScript and a
Microsoft technology called direct animation

149
00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:02.520
that no one remembers cause
it died. Then there was

150
00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:05.220
another one from Microsoft called
Chrome effects, but that also

151
00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:08.390
died. But in the end
I ended up being coolest

152
00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:11.250
I'm all 10 years later.
So that's, that's fine. I

153
00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:15.150
didn't miss learning all this
stuff, but I started from

154
00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:17.700
a very, from very high
level languages and I delve

155
00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:21.120
deeper as I needed to.
And things like windows handle.

156
00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:23.280
And to be honest with
you, I've been, I've been

157
00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:26.400
coding in this industry for
nearly 15 years. I still

158
00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:30.180
don't know how to clean
behind myself in C plus

159
00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:32.250
plus because I don't write
it as best. I know

160
00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:34.830
the concepts, I learned them
over time, but I never,

161
00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:39.120
I never needed them because
the language never, never was

162
00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.590
part of the projects I
was working on. So I

163
00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:43.370
think it's not so much
where you come from. It's

164
00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:45.990
just having that knowledge built
over time. We have to

165
00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:49.950
accept that a large majority
of the developers that we

166
00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:53.610
work with are not going
to spend all their time

167
00:09:53.850 --> 00:10:00.600
learning about windows architecture, about
languages, about hardware. There's. Another

168
00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:03.960
guys are just happy doing
high level code, and they

169
00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:07.710
crank that code at that
level. They will go as

170
00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:09.570
deep as they need for
that project to know deeper.

171
00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:14.430
And I think that's where
I wouldn't even advance. And

172
00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:17.340
I may be a bit
radical in this. I may

173
00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:20.760
even advanced the, the majority
of developers that are targeted

174
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:27.210
by vendors are that long
tail. I think I have

175
00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:32.370
no statistics. So it's completely
Sebastien says, I think that's

176
00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:34.500
a, there's a massive market
for people that don't want

177
00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:37.650
to learn this stuff for
VB developers that will never

178
00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:41.360
know what a windows handle
is, But when making stuff

179
00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:44.420
in rest or making just
a regular web application, let's

180
00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:46.520
say that I let's say
that I know all about

181
00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:49.310
the web, but I choose
to use web forms or

182
00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:52.760
some other, you know, big
abstraction, some kind of a,

183
00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:56.930
I used to call it
personality driven development. You know,

184
00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.900
I mean there, you know,
Scott Guthrie's personality and the

185
00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:04.910
personality of the web forms,
people in the 2002, 2003

186
00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:06.980
timeframe. And you know, it
came through, they had an

187
00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:10.880
opinion and it was opinionated
development where they said, if

188
00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:13.160
you want to write for
our software, you got to

189
00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:17.360
buy into the whole worldview.
You know, you couldn't get

190
00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:20.990
out from underneath it, but
now do you think that

191
00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:24.170
we have to know that
are you, are you, are

192
00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:28.370
you I'm disabled in some
way, if you don't really

193
00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:32.240
understand what's happening underneath the
internet itself? I think, I

194
00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:35.390
mean, my, my, my work
is, is mostly as a

195
00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:40.670
consultant, right? So my, my
proper answer for this is

196
00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:45.990
my consultant answer. It depends,
but I think the, the

197
00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:49.950
reality is people need to
learn new approaches like that

198
00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:53.740
because of market pressure. The
market pressure is to provide

199
00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:58.480
nice Nike designed HTTPS KPIs
that are easy to use.

200
00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:02.740
That's what people want. So
people that provide API is

201
00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:06.370
need to know how to
design nice HTTP API. Do

202
00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:11.320
you need your HTTP API
to be arrest API? Not

203
00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:15.490
necessarily. I mean, I design
distributed systems. What I do

204
00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:19.180
is I'm in front of
a big console and I

205
00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:21.850
have plenty of little knobs
and I turn the little

206
00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:25.690
nubs at different intensity levels
based on what I want

207
00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:28.900
to try and get. So
sometimes it means I'm going

208
00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:31.480
to get even sourcing in
there. Sometimes it means that

209
00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:35.770
I'm going to have maybe
and service buttons there. Sometimes

210
00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:38.290
it means I'm going to
have a pure rest API

211
00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:41.470
on parts of the system.
All these components integrate together,

212
00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:44.590
but that's because I'm lucky
enough in my life, I

213
00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:48.910
can actually help design the
whole system for developers. If

214
00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:53.350
you asked to build an
HTTP API, it is probably

215
00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:57.160
a good idea to know
what you're doing. Mostly because

216
00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:01.480
as, as you said, the
more, the more people design,

217
00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:05.320
good HTTP APIs are more
and more restful. The more

218
00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:09.370
people expect that the more
people expect that the more

219
00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:12.220
they're going to be wanted,
there is a, there is

220
00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:15.040
a fundamental, right? If developers
are happy thing, a nice

221
00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:18.160
HTTP API with links, et
cetera, it is not because

222
00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:21.670
two or three rest purists
are following every, every developer

223
00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:24.100
in the world with a
knife saying, you'd better put

224
00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:26.380
a link in there or
health. I think it's because

225
00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:28.990
people see the value in
it. They wouldn't get excited

226
00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:31.870
about it otherwise. So when
you see the proliferation of

227
00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:36.070
API so happening, now they
are happening because developers are

228
00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:39.820
learning about how the web
works, because developers are learning

229
00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:44.350
about how restful architectures are
built. And because people like

230
00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:47.600
them, people like rest API,
I think that's the, that's

231
00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:52.740
the fundamental. Yeah. I find
that when you, when you're

232
00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:55.260
not kind of going against
the way that the wind

233
00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:59.070
is blowing things work out
better and you know, the,

234
00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:00.780
the internet works a certain
way and you try to

235
00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:03.840
work against the internet. That's
when you get into trouble.

236
00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:08.070
And I totally agree with
you that rest APIs that

237
00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:12.330
feel right are ones that
feel like the internet, you

238
00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:16.110
know, they don't feel like
someone's opinion. So you're doing

239
00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:20.430
not only are you doing
classes presumably all over Europe

240
00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:23.400
on practical rests, but you're
also gonna write a book

241
00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:26.910
on this. Yeah, that's very
exciting. So I've been running

242
00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:30.120
this classes for a while,
but I've, I've revamped the

243
00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:33.780
schedule in the class. Do
you have modules so that

244
00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:35.610
I can adapt the format
and the time's a little

245
00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:38.310
bit better to, to this
location? So we're doing a

246
00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:42.930
tour of Eastern Europe soon
with that training course, it's

247
00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:46.740
called practical rest. Hypermedia for
the rest of us. And

248
00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:51.200
a lot of the time
I have very particular way

249
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:53.570
of teaching. I don't really
like using slides and I

250
00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:57.020
certainly don't like giving students
all the content before they

251
00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:00.200
arrive. So in my classes,
I'm a bit like you

252
00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:02.720
are knowing teacher school. I
tend to write on the

253
00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:05.270
board and write on pieces
of paper and force you

254
00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:09.320
to write down stuff. It's
just my teaching technique. But

255
00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:12.020
at the end, very often
people, once you have the

256
00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:15.860
content in a reusable, indexable
fashion, and on top of

257
00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:19.400
that, a lot of people
very often ask me on

258
00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:23.360
Twitter to describe to them
something that will take 300

259
00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:26.420
pages to describe. So Twitter
is not exactly the best

260
00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:29.060
medium for that. So I've
had to the idea of

261
00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:32.690
writing a book that is
basically a brain dump of

262
00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:35.060
all the stuff I teach
in my classes and all

263
00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:39.290
the stuff I've learned over
the years building systems and

264
00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:41.030
the book is going to
be called practical rest. And

265
00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:43.490
I thought, well, writing a
book is a bit of

266
00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:46.610
a challenge to start with.
So why not make it

267
00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:51.830
even worse and attempt to
go completely self published route

268
00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:54.770
just for the fun of
it and see if, if,

269
00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:57.410
if we can get some
leverage. And I said, it

270
00:15:57.410 --> 00:16:02.120
happened, Kickstarter started accepting UK
projects since the beginning of

271
00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:05.600
the year. So I thought
one plus one, let's try

272
00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:08.060
and do that. So what
we're gonna do is publish

273
00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:12.410
the, publish some details about
the book, about what is

274
00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:14.540
going to be in that.
And the project is going

275
00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:17.960
to be on Kickstarter and
you'll be able to reserve

276
00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:22.190
your pre release copy of
the book on that. And

277
00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:24.260
if we reach the target
are going to go and

278
00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:28.370
isolate myself in a big
house somewhere very silent, I

279
00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:32.620
can just write, write, write
all day and hopefully give

280
00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:36.050
a, give a good kickstart
in the project and have

281
00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:40.970
a few chapters spitting out
quite quickly. So I'm not

282
00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:44.300
sure if it's gonna work,
we'll see writing a book

283
00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:48.260
with us and editors are
an interesting challenge, but I

284
00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:50.900
think it's a, it's a,
it's a, the, the journey

285
00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:53.900
has been to be most
of the fun, really. So

286
00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:57.650
that's launching end of the
weekend, beginning of next week

287
00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:01.510
Does so doing a Kickstarter
like that. I've got a

288
00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:05.080
couple of friends, who've done
books on Kickstarter, and that's

289
00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:09.220
mostly to, to finance the
ability to basically shut off

290
00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:12.190
your consultancy and just disappear.
Like you said, go into

291
00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:15.370
a cabin somewhere and write
and write the book. Yes,

292
00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:17.410
I think, I think, I
think, I think you'd need

293
00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:20.590
to, because, well, there's really
two kinds of books. There

294
00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:24.490
are books such as described
how to do this task

295
00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:28.150
or how to write a
class. So introduction to C-sharp

296
00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:33.280
things are reasonably straightforward subjects.
When you think about rest,

297
00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:36.010
you don't want to be
just copying and pasting all

298
00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:38.320
the content that already exist
out there. You want to

299
00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:40.900
be able to formalize a
new way of showing it

300
00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:44.080
to people. And that requires,
that requires a lot of

301
00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:48.550
thinking and that thinking can't
be interrupted every day by

302
00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:52.380
going to clients. So Kickstarter,
yeah, there, the advantage is

303
00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:55.440
you can literally just take
four weeks off, go away

304
00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:59.490
somewhere with a whiteboard on
your own and try to

305
00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:01.860
formalize a new, a new
approach and a new way

306
00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:05.190
of, of, of teaching that
subject. It's really, yeah. It

307
00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:08.990
is completely about shutting the
consultancy for awhile. Yeah. And

308
00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:11.330
will this be done as
a PDF or are you

309
00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:16.400
gonna actually print, like self-publish
physical, dead trees and then

310
00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:20.420
give those to people at
your, at your, at your

311
00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:24.620
group training sessions? Yeah. So
if it's going to be

312
00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:28.430
so for the Kickstarter, the
three edition, you can get

313
00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:33.230
the, the executive edition, which
came to be leather covered

314
00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:36.800
it's for those people that
want to have my words

315
00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:39.170
lasting for more than a
hundred years on their cupboard,

316
00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:44.090
quite a frightful fateful view,
but we will we'll we'll,

317
00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:47.180
we'll do some funny, funny
things like having a customized

318
00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:51.080
USB key saying practical rest.
I was there or something

319
00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:54.770
like that, but that also
gives you full access to

320
00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:57.560
my, to my GitHub account
where I'm keeping the text.

321
00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:00.770
So you can actually see
the edits live if you

322
00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:03.320
so decide and comment on
them and do all this

323
00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:06.590
stuff, then you've got the
printed edition printed edition will

324
00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:08.840
be a signed copy, and
that we will print on

325
00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:11.480
wood. And then you've got
an online edition, which is

326
00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:14.510
be a, will be a
PDF that you can download

327
00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:19.790
to whatever tablets device you
may, you may own a,

328
00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:22.970
so there's going to be
the three choices moving forward

329
00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:27.050
after the Kickstarter. I'm not
sure. I'd like, I'd like

330
00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:28.670
to have it printed just
because I want to be

331
00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:31.490
able to give one to
my mum. We should probably

332
00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:35.090
try to make sure that
you maintain, you know, get

333
00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:38.840
like an ESPN number and
maintain the, the copyright. So

334
00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:42.590
that if, if I, if
a, what am I trying

335
00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:46.850
to say? If a publisher
comes along and says, Hey,

336
00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:49.970
this is great. I see
that you self publish this,

337
00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:52.070
but we really want to
turn this into a book

338
00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:56.180
and publish it through a
publishing brand. You want to

339
00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:59.960
be able to keep that
door open, right? Yeah, absolutely.

340
00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:02.630
I'll certainly, but I think,
I think it's a difficult

341
00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:05.570
one I've discussed with publishers
before, and I know the

342
00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:08.990
contracts that they usually have.
So I think if the

343
00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:11.540
book is sustainable, as it
is, they'll be much more

344
00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:14.720
open to discuss how to
evolve the book, but such

345
00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:16.370
a need, but I wouldn't
want to be in a

346
00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:23.750
situation would be for the
book. How would you call

347
00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:26.120
that book intellectual ownership to
be owned by someone else?

348
00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:28.700
I wouldn't want someone else
to be doing the addition

349
00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:32.330
version two of my book,
because I it's, it's, it's

350
00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:34.670
not a serious book. It's
really, this is a brain

351
00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:37.340
dump of the bastion of
today. This is really what,

352
00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:39.830
this is only the, the
only thing that the book

353
00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:43.310
presents to be a reflection
of my thinking on the

354
00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:45.890
subject. So I think, I
think that would be Dean

355
00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:50.020
matured. If, if some of
the control over the future

356
00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:52.270
of the book was given
to a, to a publisher.

357
00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:55.300
But again, if the book
has already been published and

358
00:20:55.420 --> 00:21:00.370
it's been reasonably successful, publishers
are good business people as

359
00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:02.800
well. And she'll, I'm sure
we'll, we'll be able to

360
00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:06.610
have a good conversation on,
on how to move forward.

361
00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:08.890
I'm not too worried about
it, but yeah, absolutely. I

362
00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:11.680
mean, it's, it's, it's I
think you'll, I take your

363
00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:14.580
advice on that. Yeah. I've
got a book I've been

364
00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:17.490
trying to get out for
a long time using lean

365
00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:21.390
pub. Have you seen lean
pub? Yes, yes, yes, yes.

366
00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:23.910
Yeah, it is though. I
think you're absolutely right to

367
00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:25.860
do it this way, because
it is the getting it

368
00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:29.550
done part, they shutting off
your brain and going somewhere

369
00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:33.570
else up in a cabin
like Stephen King does. That's going

370
00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:34.560
to be the only way
you're going to get it

371
00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:39.630
done. Yeah, I think so.
I think so. So you

372
00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:41.430
did it, you got the
class on practical rest. Are

373
00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:45.120
you ever going to do
that in the States? I

374
00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:47.040
would love to. I would
absolutely love to. I love

375
00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:49.740
the States. I come as
often as I can, but

376
00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:55.350
as you know, it's a
bit complicated to organize, to

377
00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:57.360
organize your ins to come
and work in the States.

378
00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:00.780
So if we have the
opportunity and I managed to

379
00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:03.750
surround myself with people that
know how to push all

380
00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:06.000
the buttons of the American
government to get the correct

381
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.010
visa. Yeah. I would love
to come and do it.

382
00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:12.900
Yeah. Hopefully, maybe someone from
when elector development or Pluralsight

383
00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:14.790
or somebody knows how to
push those buttons and can

384
00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:19.350
make that happen. That would
be brilliant that you did

385
00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:21.300
that. I thought it was
kind of funny was, you

386
00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:23.700
know, I do a lot
of things for diabetes research

387
00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:27.990
and you did some stuff
for cancer research here. I

388
00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:30.630
know that my kids are
doing things like they run

389
00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:33.540
a certain number of laps
or they do some feet

390
00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:37.410
of strength or some physical
stress. And then you give

391
00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:39.000
them money. Like, Oh, if
you can run these many

392
00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.830
laps, we'll give you a
dollar for each lap. What,

393
00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:44.850
what did you do recently
to raise money? Well, because

394
00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:47.370
I live in the UK,
you know, the reputation the

395
00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:50.730
Brits have, which is to
drink way too much is,

396
00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:57.480
is, is absolutely deserved. Cancer
research in the UK had

397
00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:00.540
the great idea, which was
to get people, to get

398
00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:04.920
sponsored for giving up alcohol
for January, for the whole

399
00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:09.420
month, it's called a Dryathlon
and you registered on the

400
00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:11.640
website. You can become a
dry athlete. It's a friend

401
00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:14.640
of mine showed me the
website. My family has been

402
00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:21.120
hit by cancer quite a
few times. So I wanted

403
00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:23.850
to give a little tip
a little bit back to

404
00:23:23.850 --> 00:23:27.750
the members of my family
that went through that. And

405
00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:29.850
so I thought it would
be interesting too, to give

406
00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:33.450
up alcohol. So I, I
put on a target of

407
00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:38.460
500 pounds, which was to
give up alcohol in February

408
00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:41.940
as well. So we reached
that target and I got

409
00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:47.600
an email last week. The
last, the last count was

410
00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:52.880
702 pounds. So we 300
pounds short of my original

411
00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:55.010
target, which was a thousand
pounds for which I would

412
00:23:55.010 --> 00:23:58.690
have shaved my head. Is
there, is there still time?

413
00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:00.580
I mean, we might want
to get your head shaved.

414
00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:05.260
I would love to see
that. Well, the collections for

415
00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:08.440
me is, is, is not
running anymore. But if you

416
00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:11.170
click on the link that
was on my blog, you

417
00:24:11.170 --> 00:24:14.590
can still give to cancer
research. We will have to

418
00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:17.920
put off the shaving until
next year. Now I will

419
00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:21.310
definitely do it again next
year. Next January. You want

420
00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:24.700
to do that for your
Kickstarter? Well, yes, we could

421
00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:28.240
do that. Definitely. That's a
good idea, actually. I mean,

422
00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:30.070
if they're fans of rest,
they're going to win, but

423
00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:31.480
if they want to see
you with your head shaved,

424
00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:35.380
I think they would also
win. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. You're

425
00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:37.690
like, actually I'm, I'm not
sure if anyone cares about

426
00:24:37.690 --> 00:24:40.600
seeing it, see my, my,
my head completely bolts, but

427
00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:44.650
I think it would be
fun. So, so yeah, we

428
00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:46.870
did. We did that and,
and I'll do it next

429
00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:49.390
year again, and I'll continue
trying to raise more funds.

430
00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:52.990
That was my, my time
of the year to give

431
00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:57.670
back. That's cool. That's cool.
Back to the consulting stuff

432
00:24:57.670 --> 00:24:59.080
you were saying that you
do a lot of work

433
00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:01.360
in distributed systems, you do
primarily all of your work

434
00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:06.430
is in consulting. How do
restful systems fit into like

435
00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:10.750
a corporate enterprise? I've always
thought that the rest will

436
00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:13.360
stuff happens on the outside
when the browser talks to

437
00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:15.670
the backend. But if you're
going to go and talk

438
00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:19.810
to some big banking system
or some certificate system, you

439
00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:23.140
might end up bumping into
soap or Ws security. I'm

440
00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:24.760
curious if you could talk
a little bit about that.

441
00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:29.380
I've, I've, I've, I've hardly
a privilege on using that

442
00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:31.870
word for now to work
in a lot of big

443
00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:37.390
financial institutions. How does a
restful system fit in an

444
00:25:37.390 --> 00:25:40.870
enterprise system? Like every other
system in an enterprise system?

445
00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:49.090
Not quite right, but you
know, I think big enterprise

446
00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:54.310
systems having worked on them
is not as enterprising as

447
00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:56.950
they sound in the sense
that the majority of the

448
00:25:57.550 --> 00:26:00.250
banking environments I've been in
I've grown more or less

449
00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:03.430
organically. The reason why there's
a lot of WCF and

450
00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:07.120
soap and, and obvious security,
et cetera. It's just because

451
00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:09.490
everybody does it the same
way. If someone puts their

452
00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:13.120
head out and start doing
something else, no one is

453
00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:17.980
really, really that concerned provided
you spend enough time going

454
00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:21.520
through the security reviews, the
architecture reviews and all the

455
00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:23.800
various bits of paperwork you
have to do in the

456
00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:27.880
bank. After that, you know,
one of the beauty is

457
00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:33.040
you use the web browser.
We use, we use rest

458
00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:35.680
when, as a browser and
a browser talks to, but

459
00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:40.090
if you rethink problems slightly
and you consider that your

460
00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:48.390
data entry application, your business
center application, you trading, your

461
00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:51.960
trading application is a browser.
It just happens to have

462
00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:56.220
a completely different user interface
to your common web browser,

463
00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:58.290
but it is a browser.
If you think about it

464
00:26:58.290 --> 00:27:00.870
in those terms. So if
you think about your system

465
00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:04.950
that needs to retrieve stock
market values is also a

466
00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:08.220
browser. Even though it doesn't
have a user interface, you'll

467
00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:11.010
actually, it doesn't have a
graphical user interface. If you

468
00:27:11.010 --> 00:27:14.370
rethink each of those independent
systems as being browses, then

469
00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:18.060
suddenly you'll find that there's
plenty of places when rest

470
00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:21.180
apply very well. Now, the
advantage we have with web

471
00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:24.720
browser, especially in big organizations,
things like certificates already solved.

472
00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:29.070
Fundamentally, if you have security
that deployed across the whole

473
00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:31.950
of your company, it is
going to be deployed for

474
00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:34.440
the web browser as well.
That means that when you're

475
00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:36.540
going to build a rest
client B it's that you're

476
00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:38.730
going to have a stock
market application, or you're going

477
00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:41.100
to have a data entry
application, or maybe it's just

478
00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:43.860
going to be a web
app. All those web technologies

479
00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:47.280
already deployed in enterprise. So
I would say that the

480
00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:50.340
enterprise world is even more
ready and available for grabs

481
00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:53.580
for rests than, than all
the systems, because all the

482
00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:56.430
heavy work has been done.
You arrive in an environment

483
00:27:56.430 --> 00:27:59.280
where the web is already
at the core of everything,

484
00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:02.310
because everybody used the browser
all the time. Everything's over

485
00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:04.530
your web apps, what security.
So where do you deploy

486
00:28:04.530 --> 00:28:10.830
it everywhere you want actually
fast tracking rest adoption much,

487
00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:14.070
much faster than say if
someone decided to create a

488
00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:18.990
completely new website this stack
tomorrow. So I think it

489
00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:22.140
actually fits very well. The
difficulty is more of a

490
00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:25.590
political one than we did
a technological one. So the

491
00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:28.770
technology part of things, it's,
it's, it's a smooth ride.

492
00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:32.370
We've deployed really cool systems
that I've deployed a system

493
00:28:32.370 --> 00:28:37.350
with with one team, which
I just think is great.

494
00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:42.360
We needed to display lots
of data grids. You know,

495
00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:46.770
the enterprise welds means speaker
grits, mostly 90% of what

496
00:28:46.770 --> 00:28:50.220
is done at the enterprise
is data grids. So we

497
00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:53.310
decided to rethink the data
grid as an HTML table

498
00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:58.200
browser. So basically your nice
windfall application with all the

499
00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:02.100
data grids, it's just going
to get HTML pages from

500
00:29:02.130 --> 00:29:05.220
each HTML table, it's phones
and Ishmael page. It shows

501
00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:08.070
a data grid. We solved
so many problems with such

502
00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:11.490
a simple technology. It's amazing.
That's the power of we're

503
00:29:11.490 --> 00:29:15.930
using web technologies today. She
is funding. It's rethinking what

504
00:29:15.930 --> 00:29:18.030
the browser is and where
the application is. And when

505
00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:22.140
you do that, you leverage
so much so easily. It's

506
00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:25.760
amazing. Yeah. I mean, it
is really coming down to

507
00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:27.680
making the, using the web
the way the web was

508
00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:30.320
meant to be created. Not
that not building in a

509
00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:35.600
bunch of infrastructure for, for
things that the company doesn't

510
00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:38.780
necessarily support, just remembering that
the company already supports the

511
00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:44.830
web and use those technologies
That spreads. I like that

512
00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:47.710
way of looking at things.
So where can people find

513
00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:52.020
you online? Learn more about
what you're doing? Yeah, I'm

514
00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:55.440
just, I just launched a
very badly designed website. It's

515
00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:59.430
called serial seven.com. And so
you can find on there

516
00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:03.720
all the talks I give
the locations where I'll be,

517
00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:06.990
it's mostly not for me
to tell people where I

518
00:30:06.990 --> 00:30:08.970
am. It's more for me
to remind myself, I need

519
00:30:08.970 --> 00:30:12.450
to go to certain conferences
in case I would forget.

520
00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:15.630
And there's a whole section
on practical wrestle. There will

521
00:30:15.630 --> 00:30:18.570
be links on, on the,
the content of the course,

522
00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:21.360
the content of the book,
the Kickstarter address, et cetera,

523
00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:23.340
et cetera. There's even a
media section. If you want

524
00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:25.140
to download my face and
put it in your bag

525
00:30:25.170 --> 00:30:30.570
on your background computer. Cool.
Well, that's great. Fantastic. Well,

526
00:30:30.570 --> 00:30:33.750
thanks so much for chatting
with me today and hopefully

527
00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:37.980
we'll, we'll see practical rest
and book form variation. Well,

528
00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:44.730
hopefully fingers crossed for maximum
12 months of work. I'm

529
00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:46.410
sure we'll get that. Thank
you very much for having

530
00:30:46.410 --> 00:30:48.210
me on the show today.
My pleasure, and then be

531
00:30:48.210 --> 00:30:49.770
sure to send me the
link and we'll put that

532
00:30:49.770 --> 00:30:51.720
in the show notes. You
can find a link to

533
00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:55.170
his Kickstarter in, in a
week or so when it

534
00:30:55.170 --> 00:30:57.810
goes live, when it goes
live. Wonderful. Thank you very

535
00:30:57.810 --> 00:31:01.320
much. Alright. This has been
another episode of Hansel minutes

536
00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:02.730
and we'll see you again
next week.
