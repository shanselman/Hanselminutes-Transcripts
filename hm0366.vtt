talks with Caleb, Charles about

8
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:57.950
WordPress and internet security. Hi,
this is Scott Hanselman. This

9
00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.930
is another episode of Hansel
minutes. And on the phone

10
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.290
we've got Keller Charles, a
security researcher and a, the

11
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.040
runner of security, oerb.com. How
are you? I'm doing great,

12
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.640
Scott, Thanks for chatting with
me today. You know, we

13
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.390
met and talked about security
at a blogging conference about

14
00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.200
a year. Yeah, yeah. In
Philly. Yeah. And it's a

15
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.660
security has been a little
crazy lately and there's, there's,

16
00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.840
there's hacking and they're spammers.
I had a spammer dump

17
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.260
his entire source template onto
my blog just, just today.

18
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.900
And I got a little
bit of an insight into

19
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.620
the techniques they're using. He
basically had a giant dictionary

20
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.570
of spam that he was
throwing at me that, and

21
00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.960
it was all meant to
look like plain English. These

22
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.330
are real people out there.
These are like, I used

23
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.250
to think it was just
computers, but now they're using

24
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.120
mechanical Turks and actual humans
to hack. Oh yeah. Yeah,

25
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.490
definitely. And you know, and
that's one of the things,

26
00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.100
you know, that we try
to do, you know, at

27
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.850
security orb is bringing awareness,
you know, to the potential

28
00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.740
dangers of security, many people,
especially end users, you know,

29
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.440
think that, you know, I'm
just a lone Wolf, you

30
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.760
know, the hackers, you know,
don't have any care about

31
00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.660
my computer, my little, you
know, windows seven computer. And

32
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.060
you know, what we try
to bring awareness to is

33
00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.930
that, you know, everyone is,
you know, a target for

34
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.790
these guys. Cause either they're
going to go after the

35
00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.550
big companies and try to
steal data, or they're going

36
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.590
to go after your computer
to try to use it

37
00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.770
as part of a bot
net network, you know, to

38
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.280
cause problems for somebody else.
So the awareness is very

39
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.560
important and that's one of
the things that we try

40
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.280
to bring to light, you
know, to everyone that we

41
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.970
engage with, Does it seem
like WordPress is like, that's

42
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.940
the target does. Like, we
all know that windows has

43
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.510
been targeted for years, but
because it's the biggest, right.

44
00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.030
It's the biggest target, but
now it seems like WordPress

45
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.050
hacking is, is what people
like to do. Yeah. WordPress

46
00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.080
has always been a target,
as you stated with windows,

47
00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.940
windows holes over 85%. I
mean, I think the last

48
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.410
percentage that I saw was
88.9% of the desktop and

49
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:11.560
PC market WordPress holds a
high number as well. So,

50
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.680
you know, if I'm writing
some malicious code to cause

51
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.880
some trouble to steal some
money to further a cause,

52
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.060
you know, with hacktivism and
so forth, I'm going to

53
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.850
go after the biggest piece
of the pie and WordPress,

54
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:30.370
when it comes to blogging
websites, content management systems, WordPress

55
00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.000
is definitely the key. And
another thing about WordPress with

56
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.370
it being open source, you
know, these malicious people's hackers,

57
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.430
crackers, whatever you want to
identify them, as they're able

58
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.550
to look at the code
and look to see if

59
00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.850
there's any flaws that they
could expose and you know,

60
00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.900
and that's, you know, a
good thing about open sources

61
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.690
that, you know, many people
can review the code and

62
00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.300
these things get fixed pretty
well. But if there is

63
00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.180
a bug, you know, these
hackers will find it because

64
00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.900
they are good. Interesting. So
you're, I never thought about

65
00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.570
it like that. I know
people complain about windows being,

66
00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.050
not open source, but you
think people are actually scanning

67
00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.680
the code and looking for
looking for exploits. I mean,

68
00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.620
there's one, you know, there's,
there's black box exploits and

69
00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.810
there's white box exploits. And
if the code's right there,

70
00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.210
that's going to give them
an idea of where to

71
00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:26.760
where to poke at Exactly.
And whenever a new version

72
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:32.430
comes out, these hackers will
dump the code and review

73
00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:38.180
the code line for line.
And we'll find something there,

74
00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:44.040
billion lines of code and
only, but so much can

75
00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.330
be fixed upfront. So there
are vulnerabilities that will be

76
00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.440
found. And that's why, you
know, as part of like

77
00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.950
the talk that I planned
to conduct at blogging while

78
00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.310
Brown, one of the things
that I definitely discuss is

79
00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.270
conducting these updates, not only
to the framework, but as

80
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.900
well as to the plugins,
because once these vulnerabilities are

81
00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.220
found, it's really a matter
of minutes before the exploits

82
00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.810
actually begin. Really. So as
soon as someone, as soon

83
00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.180
as someone comes out with
an update, they are going

84
00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.680
to go and try to
attack that update, or are

85
00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.090
they going to go for
the unpatched older blogs? We'll

86
00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.720
go for the unpatched blocks.
Cause the updates usually come

87
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.930
out to fix the vulnerability
or the exploit that is

88
00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:35.730
located. So yeah. How does,
how does WordPress update does

89
00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:37.440
it, do I have to,
I mean, I'm not familiar

90
00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.740
with WordPress very much. I
know that updating my blog

91
00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.470
means, you know, downloading it
to my local machine and

92
00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.440
then sending it back up
to my host is WordPress

93
00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.700
actually able to update itself
now? Well, it doesn't update

94
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:57.320
itself, but once version 3.0,
came out, they definitely, it

95
00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:01.400
a lot simpler than the
previous version version two, basically

96
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.900
just go into the dashboard
and it will be assigned

97
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.590
indicating, Hey, you know, this
is your current version. This

98
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:12.560
is the new version, hit
this update button and it

99
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:15.590
automatically does it in the
background. And it's the same

100
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:18.590
thing for the plugins as
well. You know, the dashboard

101
00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.070
will state that there are
four or five plugins that

102
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:24.740
needs to be updated. You
check the ones that you

103
00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.690
want to update and you
hit update and it does

104
00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:29.020
it in the background. It
seems like, it seems like

105
00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:33.310
the existence of, of the
plugins is a, it's a

106
00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:36.190
big hole. It's a, you're
basically, it's one thing to

107
00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:39.490
trust WordPress, but now you're
trusting some random dude that

108
00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:43.450
knew enough to write a
plugin. Yeah. And that's definitely

109
00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:48.910
a huge problem in the
WordPress framework. Not only are

110
00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:52.540
you trying to trust an
individual, but you do have

111
00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:56.800
plugins where the individual stopped
supporting it and disappears and

112
00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.690
just says, you know what?
This is too much work.

113
00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:01.090
Or I just got married
or I'm in school and

114
00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:03.790
I don't want to support
this plugin anymore. And that

115
00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:08.620
plugin, you know, will stay
at its state for maybe

116
00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:12.040
a year or so. And
again, if there are some

117
00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:16.150
sort of vulnerability that is
located, you have no way

118
00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:18.370
of updating it. And most
of the time you don't

119
00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:21.400
even know about it until
something bad happens to the

120
00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:26.170
site. WordPress has written in
PHP and hacking, of course,

121
00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:30.220
it's not specific to PHP.
Everyone's a target, but WordPress

122
00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:34.870
isn't compiled it's interpreted. So
if someone can get a

123
00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:39.700
dot PHP file onto your
server under your backend, then

124
00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:43.930
they're basically are running code
and full trust, right? They,

125
00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:45.850
they own the system. If
they can get a line

126
00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:49.090
of their own PHP, right?
How are they, how are

127
00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:52.330
they getting it? How are
they getting the PHP, their

128
00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:58.600
evil code onto your server's
hard drive? Wow. I mean,

129
00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:01.480
it happens through a number
of ways and I'll try

130
00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:07.270
to go back from a
logical perspective, but you have

131
00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:13.780
certain ISP that do not
follow certain security protocols and

132
00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:18.970
malicious actors are able to
get in through the ISP

133
00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:23.380
level, through the operating system.
You also have many users

134
00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:27.760
who are using shared hosting
and within the shared host,

135
00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:34.930
then I've read of situations
where a particular site having

136
00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:41.110
holes and vulnerabilities and using
certain services that allowed them

137
00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:44.770
to come in and able
to get to a cer

138
00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:50.710
servers on a hosting platform.
And you also have the

139
00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:56.280
users of that particular blog,
maybe not a strong username

140
00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:02.580
and password using WordPress in
places such as Starbucks. And

141
00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:06.960
the information are able to
get sniffed and reuse, having

142
00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.350
a compromised system that has
a Trojan that kind of

143
00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:14.340
records all their keystrokes. And
within that, a user is

144
00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:16.710
able to use the information
that they collect to go

145
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:23.880
in. You also have bots,
these automatic systems that scans

146
00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:28.380
networks and are able to
find vulnerabilities within certain plugins

147
00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:33.780
that do allow them to
have remote and admin access.

148
00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:37.440
WordPress had a big problem
last year with attempt thumb

149
00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:43.470
a plugin that had many
sites on their knees because

150
00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:47.970
of a bad plugin that
gave malicious actors access to,

151
00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:53.280
you know, the hard drive
admin database and tons of

152
00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:56.280
locations. So there are a
number of vectors that can

153
00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:58.980
allow, you know, a bad
actor to get in and

154
00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:01.950
conduct a whatever malicious activity
is that they want to

155
00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:04.670
do. It's a number of
things that you've kind of

156
00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:08.900
gone through there. The Tim
thumb issue was in, in

157
00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:15.200
August of 2011, and that
was a, an image resizing

158
00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:18.260
library that was really popular.
And what happened was it

159
00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.120
was used in themes. And
I think one of the

160
00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:23.720
things people don't realize about
the WordPress community and the

161
00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:28.070
blog community is that a
theme can opt in to

162
00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:32.270
plugins. So you might think
you're using no plugins, but

163
00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:35.840
I theme that you, you
thought was pretty, you bring

164
00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:38.240
down, you install into your
blog and now you've opted

165
00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:42.710
into one, two, three, four
plugins. So now you've brought

166
00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:45.710
in this kind of implicit
chain of trust. You trust

167
00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:48.500
the theme people, and then
now you gotta, you have

168
00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:50.090
to, you have no choice.
If you want your theme

169
00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:51.740
to look nice, you got
to trust these other people.

170
00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:55.130
And then Tim thumb was
kind of spread because it

171
00:10:55.130 --> 00:11:00.110
had great function. Yeah, Exactly.
And I think at least

172
00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:05.210
every free template, you know,
from the review that I

173
00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:11.030
conducted had that particular plugin
located in it. So, you

174
00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:15.380
know, users was just, you
know, had it installed without

175
00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:18.170
their knowledge. You know, many
people didn't even know that

176
00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:22.700
they were vulnerable to it
until something happened because like

177
00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:24.950
you stayed in many of
these templates came with it

178
00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:30.090
automatically. Right. Right. And, and
the, the, in the, in

179
00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:33.620
the example of Tim thumb,
they were basically allowing people

180
00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:37.100
to upload PHP code. So
you could upload images, right?

181
00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:40.520
That's what this thing allows
you to do. Exactly. And

182
00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:43.370
all it was using, it
turns out was an array

183
00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:49.550
of allowed sites to say,
you know, here's where, here's

184
00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:52.340
where I want to allow
files being uploaded from. And

185
00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:54.640
anyone could just fake that.
And this is where it

186
00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:57.790
gets down to don't trust
user input. If someone just

187
00:11:57.790 --> 00:12:00.340
pretended that they were flicker
or pretended, you know, change

188
00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:03.670
their HTP, refer to say
their flicker, suddenly they can

189
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:06.430
start uploading. And they allow
people to upload PHP files,

190
00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:10.180
even though it was about
images. Exactly, exactly. Which is

191
00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:13.650
rather foolish, I think. And
I, it comes with the

192
00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:17.910
coding sometimes, you know, that
verification and validation aspect. I

193
00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:20.130
still think that I know
when I'm writing code, I'm

194
00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:24.300
not thinking about evil. I'm
just trying to think about

195
00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:27.540
functionality. And that's, that's a
problem in all aspects of

196
00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:29.730
programming is that you have
to sit down and think

197
00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:31.680
about, okay, I'm a good
guy. And then you have

198
00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:33.270
to go and spend a
lot of time thinking about

199
00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:34.920
all right. I'm bad. I
mean, how, when was the

200
00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.260
last time you tried to
break? You're probably not. You

201
00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.240
you're a security guy, but
what was the last time

202
00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.670
I sat down and like
spent a day or a

203
00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:45.510
week trying to break my
site, you know, it's been

204
00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.640
a long time. It doesn't,
it doesn't really happen. We

205
00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:50.130
don't do that. Right. But
I mean, you know, it's

206
00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:52.920
weird that you bring that
up, you know, but in

207
00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:57.930
academia right now, you know,
when you talk about the

208
00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:01.770
software development life cycle, and
a lot of these software

209
00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:08.160
engineering courses, there's been a
big push to incorporate security

210
00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:12.540
into the actual process as
compared to waiting until the

211
00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:17.970
end, you know, cause what
we are seeing in industry

212
00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:21.360
and is trickling down to
academia is that it costs

213
00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:24.120
more, it costs more in
the long run, not only

214
00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:26.940
in going back and trying
to fit security into the

215
00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:31.890
application, but if a compromise
does occur, you know, with

216
00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:35.040
the problem and the trust
factor. So I've seen a

217
00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:38.700
big push in the past
few years where security, a

218
00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:42.030
lot of proposed research papers
are trying to, you know,

219
00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:45.570
incorporate this new security development
lifecycle. And there's like a

220
00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:49.770
security phase that happens after
each phase. So yeah. And

221
00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:52.290
at Microsoft, I know that
we've got people doing that

222
00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:54.640
with, with all of our
products, but you know, as

223
00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:57.360
a startup, sometimes doesn't put
that much work into it.

224
00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:00.150
Yeah. Because there was a
cost factor associated with it.

225
00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:02.160
And sometimes you just want
to get that product out

226
00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:06.720
there. I absolutely do back
to how things happen on

227
00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:08.670
WordPress. Like how do they
get in it? It isn't

228
00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:11.610
actually always, WordPress is fault.
As you pointed out there,

229
00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:14.430
there are back doors. There
are, you know, you said

230
00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:17.610
that the OSTP level. So
you've got, you know, FTP

231
00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:23.070
and SFTP and the WP
admin, there's different, different ways

232
00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:27.300
that don't necessarily have to
do with, with WordPress. Like

233
00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:30.030
you might have a tight
WordPress installation and you've got

234
00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:33.180
great passwords, except you forgot
that you have a default

235
00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:35.940
password on the FTP service.
Right. It has nothing to

236
00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:38.100
do with WordPress, but people
are coming in, they're coming

237
00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:43.410
in the back door. Exactly,
exactly. And of course, as

238
00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:47.790
I stated, if you're log
in using FTP, which is

239
00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:51.800
not a secure protocol or
you using the WP and

240
00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:56.720
you're not using the secure
protocol, depending on the sophistication

241
00:14:57.110 --> 00:15:01.970
or your location, someone can
obtain that information and again,

242
00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:05.780
and use it, you know,
against you. So there are

243
00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:08.080
definitely a lot of factors.
Well, this idea of a

244
00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:11.770
secure location is a really
disturbing one. This idea that

245
00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:14.950
I let's say, I go
and just buy a domain

246
00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:19.060
and install WordPress on it,
you know, and I've got

247
00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:23.080
like, you know, food.com, but
I, I'm not going to

248
00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:26.590
go and buy a, an
SSL certificate because I'm, you

249
00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:28.870
know, I'm, I'm just a
guy who wants to put

250
00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:31.630
a blog up Exactly what
to talk about your dog

251
00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:35.860
or something. But, but I
happened to go to McDonald's

252
00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:38.530
and do my, you know,
do my hacking, not my

253
00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:41.350
hacking, but my blogging there.
And there happens to be

254
00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:44.380
someone else they're using like
a fire sheep or one

255
00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:49.090
of these Firefox basic plugins.
They're actually able to see

256
00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:51.070
my password because I'm going
to go and post that

257
00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:56.200
password over HTTP, not HTTPS.
Right. Exactly. How much of

258
00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:58.300
a problem is that, like,
I know people who have

259
00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:00.550
told me that they will
not use public wifi anymore,

260
00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:04.840
And I'm very, I'm very
close to that as well,

261
00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:11.200
just because of the simplicity
to be able to not

262
00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:14.860
only conduct a man in
the middle where all the

263
00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:17.590
traffic comes to your computer
first, then you relay it

264
00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:22.660
out and it's transparent to
the end user. But as

265
00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:26.410
well as create fake IPS,
I did a demo the

266
00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:32.320
other day where within four
command lines and using that

267
00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:36.280
particular product title backtrack, I
was able to create a

268
00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:41.410
man in the middle attack
within about six command lines.

269
00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:46.420
So the simplicity and being
able to do it myself,

270
00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:53.940
give me insight that, you
know, malicious actors within this

271
00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:57.280
space can do it. So
if I do go on

272
00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:00.460
a wifi, I might just
search ESPN at the very

273
00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:05.140
least. But as for logging
in credentials at a public

274
00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:09.130
wifi locations is something that,
you know, I'm not at

275
00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:12.460
ease in doing. And I
normally try to recommend people

276
00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:15.280
not to do it unless
you have to, such as

277
00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:18.250
you know, you're about to
catch a flight and you

278
00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:21.160
need to look at your
itinerary, you know, go ahead

279
00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:23.530
and do it. But once
you do it, try to

280
00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:27.120
change your passwords as soon
as possible, because you know,

281
00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:31.030
was just an uneasy feeling
of not following those processes.

282
00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:33.940
Once you do access a
public wifi. Yeah. Everyone who's

283
00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:37.540
using a Gmail and Facebook.
Now, I believe that all

284
00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:43.780
of those sites have turned
on HTTPS. Exactly. And even

285
00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:46.900
Twitter has also followed that
lead. And, and there are

286
00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:49.500
those that say, if you
are writing a public website

287
00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:52.350
that will be receiving a
user's password to log in,

288
00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:54.900
even if you don't run
the website over SSL all

289
00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:57.630
the time, although there are
a group of people online

290
00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:00.390
that are recommending that people
run SSL all the time,

291
00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:04.020
you absolutely should have at
the very minimum, the login

292
00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:07.350
in under SSL, if not
the whole site, if you

293
00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:11.090
can do it. Exactly. Exactly.
Yeah. And folks can get

294
00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:15.470
backtrack, learn about backtrack at
backtrack, hyphen linux.org. It's a

295
00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:19.000
penetration system. You can boot
off a live CD. And

296
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.250
I've actually started using my
clear, I have a clear

297
00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:25.220
hotspot. It's a 4g hotspot
and I'm not, I'm not

298
00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:30.710
trusting, you know, Starbucks, wifi
anymore. I just have my

299
00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:34.820
own. Yeah. Yeah. I mean,
even hotel wifi, you know,

300
00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:37.910
are not, you know, So
check this out. I was

301
00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:41.000
at a hotel last week
and I'm playing on my

302
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.950
iPad and then suddenly it
pops up and it's like,

303
00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:46.430
Chris's iPhone. And like, what
the hell, Chris? His iPhone.

304
00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:48.380
I mean, we're all on
the same subnet. And I

305
00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:51.140
was thinking, I could just
go and use airplay and

306
00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:54.440
just throw the video that
I'm watching right over to

307
00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:57.770
Chris's iPhone. Just see what
Chris feels about that. Exactly.

308
00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:01.500
And I mean, that's just
how simple it is. Yeah.

309
00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:04.040
You know, and that's just
how simple and crazy it

310
00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:06.260
is. But yeah. Great. That's
actually one time I was

311
00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:10.520
at a bagel shop and
saw on Bluetooth. It was

312
00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:13.190
like Kelly's Mac. And I
looked around and there was

313
00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:15.920
one lady with one Mac
and I walked over and

314
00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:19.010
I said, are you Kelly?
And she's like uncomfortable cause

315
00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:20.960
like strange guy or, you
know, I just said, Hey,

316
00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:23.420
you know, FYI, your Bluetooth
is broadcasting. And it tells

317
00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:25.610
people your name. It had
her full name first and

318
00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:28.160
last name. And I was
like, you know, that's not

319
00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:31.580
really safe regardless of gender,
that's not safe to be.

320
00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:35.390
Right. Right. And, and you
know, and sometimes, you know,

321
00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:39.500
of course, you know, I,
I follow ethical hacker rules

322
00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:42.260
of behavior, but you know,
you have some of these

323
00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:45.500
systems that do not have
their firewalls turned on. Some

324
00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:49.310
of these systems have drives
that are being shared and

325
00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:52.370
you know, it's just open
access. If somebody wants to

326
00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:54.620
go in there and do
something or plant something in

327
00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:59.690
there. Yeah. Are there are
now things that you can

328
00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:02.690
get for WordPress specifically? And
we're talking about WordPress, just

329
00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:08.000
because it's popular with 700 million
installs, like duo, D U

330
00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.970
O duo two factor auth.
So you can actually have

331
00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:15.740
two factor auth for your
own personal WordPress website. And

332
00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:21.440
Microsoft actually turned on two
factor auth for windows live

333
00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:24.650
logins. So that means SkyDrive
and all that. It's now

334
00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:27.080
two factor, Right? Yeah. I
kind of wrote about that

335
00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:30.320
earlier this week. That was
pretty impressive. It's nice. The

336
00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:32.300
thing that I didn't really
realize when I saw that

337
00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:35.210
was that that meant that
every everything. So now I

338
00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:39.140
have Google and windows, both
doing two factors. So every

339
00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:42.410
service on the other side
of the login is now

340
00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:47.680
protected. Exactly, exactly. And you
know, athletic is definitely needs

341
00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:50.650
to be the way to
go because username and passwords

342
00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:56.920
are that initial entry point
and between, you know, users

343
00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:03.160
having multiple passwords, the ease
in obtaining these username and

344
00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:08.680
passwords two factor authentication is
definitely a player that needs

345
00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:11.490
to be in the game.
Yeah, Absolutely. And I think

346
00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:15.030
that we'll see people like
WordPress turning that on by

347
00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:17.790
default. I mean, just the
idea that I could go

348
00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:21.810
and install a blog with
no SSL and a default

349
00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:25.350
admin user kind of right
off the bat. It seems

350
00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:29.310
a little concerning to me.
Right. And you know, 75,

351
00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:32.790
well, more than that, you
always have your cell phone

352
00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:36.300
with you. And one of
the key aspects of the

353
00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:39.900
two factor is being able
to send the information to

354
00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:42.990
your cell phone for the
something that you have and

355
00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:45.540
as something that, you know,
aspect to be filled. So

356
00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:51.390
it, it will work out
pretty well. Yeah. And that,

357
00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:53.220
that, that what you just
said, you kind of glossed

358
00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:56.400
over it. It's about what
you know, and what you

359
00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:58.740
have. And that's the two
factors, it's the password in

360
00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:01.230
your brain and it's the
physical object. You can prove

361
00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:03.810
that you have right. Something
that is given to you

362
00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:07.080
exactly. Right. I actually, someone
gave me an, an interesting

363
00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:10.860
tip. They said that what
we should do when, when

364
00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:13.200
setting up two factor auth
is, is write down that

365
00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:16.350
code or print out that,
that, that bar code in

366
00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:19.290
case the phone dies crashes.
Or if, if, if, if

367
00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:22.320
that factor is lost, it
can make it a little

368
00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:25.290
bit difficult to get yourself
back in the game. If

369
00:22:25.290 --> 00:22:29.640
you've lost a factor. Exactly.
Yeah. I've been doing a

370
00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:33.570
lot of IP blocking as
well. Some people have suggested

371
00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:36.900
if you're, if you have
a, an important system to

372
00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:41.400
only allow access from certain
IPS, I noticed my bank

373
00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:45.510
recently has become very, very
suspicious. So whenever I'm traveling

374
00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:48.420
and I log into my
bank, they basically are keeping

375
00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:50.760
track of like the last
10 IPS that I logged

376
00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:54.420
in from. And when they
see one that I haven't

377
00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:57.240
been at before, they'll say,
is this really you? And

378
00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:59.610
then they'll ask me questions
about like, you know, my

379
00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:03.090
fifth grade teacher or my
favorite, right. Favorite food, have

380
00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:07.010
you re authenticate and verify
yourself? Exactly. And I, I

381
00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:09.210
think it's a shame that
we, we see those things

382
00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:12.420
with banks, but we don't
see those with, with blogs

383
00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:14.550
and with flicker and with
Twitter and things like that.

384
00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:17.970
I hope that they turn
the security up. Yeah. And

385
00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:23.130
even I've seen at least
at the enterprise level, and

386
00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:29.010
especially after the China attack
news thing that had hit

387
00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:32.580
the airways for, for a
period of time that the

388
00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:38.760
tour IP addresses are being
blocked at the enterprise level.

389
00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:40.680
Right. And maybe you could
explain what that is. Maybe

390
00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:45.260
not. Everyone's familiar with tour.
Sure. Basically with tour, let's

391
00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:49.010
say that I wanted to
go to a particular website,

392
00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:51.650
but I didn't want it
to be traced back to

393
00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:56.060
either my home IP address
or my home location or

394
00:23:56.060 --> 00:24:00.560
my work location. So I
would log in, use the

395
00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:07.160
tour service, which will provide
me an amenity where my

396
00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:11.090
personal IP address won't be
showing. It would be an

397
00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:17.180
IP address of maybe someone
in Finland or another place,

398
00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:19.430
but it just won't be
able to come back to

399
00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:23.660
me and use as like,
as a personal identifiable information

400
00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:28.280
of my location or my
internet service provider or the

401
00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:31.790
company that I work for.
And one of the things

402
00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:35.360
is that it has a
lot of legitimate purposes as

403
00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:38.960
well, you know, but as,
but you also have many

404
00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:43.610
bad actors using it, you
know, to kind of block

405
00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:48.080
their identification. And there are
certain techniques where they could

406
00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:51.380
do multiple hops. So they
could hop from like 10

407
00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:54.230
different countries. And that's how
they're able to perform some

408
00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:57.770
of the bad, bad activities,
you know, so they don't

409
00:24:57.770 --> 00:25:00.110
get caught. But it's one
of the things that I

410
00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:06.080
always stayed. There are legitimate
factors, you know, reporters, people

411
00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:11.180
in health services. But the
majority of information that we

412
00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:14.330
see coming from the tour
service are of the malicious

413
00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:17.840
aspect. And many people have
actually blocked that whole thing

414
00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:21.160
altogether. Right? It's like, you're
basically making tour, lets you

415
00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:24.910
make the world, your proxy
server. So all these other

416
00:25:24.910 --> 00:25:26.530
people are your proxy, but
there's also these kind of

417
00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:31.240
tours. They become known IPS
that there's an, I, you

418
00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:33.640
know, IPS that are like
tour mega servers that are

419
00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:34.960
doing a lot of the
work for you. So those

420
00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:37.840
are getting blocked now as
well. Yes. You did a,

421
00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:40.030
an interesting article recently where
you kind of looked at

422
00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:43.900
what splash data had released
some popular passwords and it

423
00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:48.100
is 2013, 2012 and people
are still using password as

424
00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:52.060
their password. Yes they are.
Yeah. Do we need to

425
00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:54.370
have a class in high
school to teach people that

426
00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.140
one, two, three, four, five,
six is not a valid

427
00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:59.170
password or do we, do
we need to write software

428
00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:02.980
that's if he doesn't allow
it At this point, you

429
00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:07.510
know, it's just bring out
the two factor, you know,

430
00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:12.280
cause some very bright people,
it's not just, you know,

431
00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:15.940
and not to say admins
and you know, so far,

432
00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:17.920
but you have, It was
not about being smart, right?

433
00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:21.670
It's about being educated. Exactly.
But you have those who

434
00:26:21.670 --> 00:26:28.810
are responsible in operating as
well as protecting computers using

435
00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:36.670
somebody's simple passwords, you know,
and as I stated previously,

436
00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:39.790
the two factor authentication is
going to have to be

437
00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:42.500
the thing that kind of,
you know, help out in,

438
00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:45.380
in many of these password
breaches that are occurring. Yeah.

439
00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:48.260
It's a shame. I mean,
I, I, I was just

440
00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:51.470
talking to my parents like
three, four days ago and

441
00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:53.630
I was just like, guys,
this, we really need to

442
00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:55.790
turn it up. But the
problem is that, you know,

443
00:26:55.790 --> 00:26:58.340
as people get older, it's
harder to remember these things.

444
00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:01.160
What I've been trying to
recommend for people who have

445
00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:04.220
trouble remembering complicated passwords is
don't try to come up

446
00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:07.010
with a password that is,
you know, a word, a

447
00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:10.490
number. And then, you know,
some symbol try to come

448
00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:13.010
up with a pass phrase,
you know, come up with

449
00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:16.700
a sentence. That's, that's easy
to remember, Right. From a

450
00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:20.480
movie that you like a
book, phrase, a poem, you

451
00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:24.110
know, a particular slogan, you
know, all of those are

452
00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:28.340
viable keys for a good
passphrase. Yeah. And, and this

453
00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:32.930
is easy to remember and
just having the, the length,

454
00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:36.200
like, I mean, I wouldn't
say like something like internet

455
00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:39.200
safety for kids would not
necessarily be a great passphrase

456
00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:42.050
cause it's pretty simple. But
the difference between somebody like

457
00:27:42.050 --> 00:27:45.500
that, that's like 20 plus
characters long with spaces and

458
00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:50.090
mixed case, that would be
a better password. Right. And

459
00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:55.160
even that sentence that you
just stated, the entire word

460
00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:57.680
itself would not be a
good password, but let's just

461
00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:01.790
say you take the first
letter of each word, you

462
00:28:01.790 --> 00:28:04.910
know, that can also, you
know, equate to be in

463
00:28:04.910 --> 00:28:07.820
a passphrase. I guess you
could take a favorite poem

464
00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:10.220
and you could use. And
if, if that was too

465
00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:13.040
long for the website, you
could use every first letter

466
00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:15.890
or every first letter, something
that's memorable that you're never

467
00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:19.310
going to forget. Right. Exactly.
Yeah. I think that people

468
00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:22.490
don't realize that they make
simple passwords, so they're easy

469
00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:26.510
to remember, but they could
make difficult, complicated passwords. That

470
00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:30.950
would be easy for them
to remember. Right. And, and

471
00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:34.280
one of the things that
we always discuss is having

472
00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:37.640
the digital skeleton key, where
you use the same password

473
00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:43.520
from your Facebook, your online,
shopping, your banking. And you

474
00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:47.420
know, that usually creates that
digital skeleton key. You know,

475
00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:49.820
if you're, if you're familiar
with the old concept of

476
00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:52.850
the skeleton key one key
opens all the door. If

477
00:28:52.850 --> 00:28:55.910
you use the same password
for all your online accounts

478
00:28:55.910 --> 00:29:02.420
and you have a account
with like food.com, you know,

479
00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:07.550
kid's store, which may not
have a high security controls.

480
00:29:07.550 --> 00:29:10.610
And someone gets into that,
they will try that same

481
00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:14.540
password on your Facebook, your
banking, and get into all

482
00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:18.800
your online accounts. So definitely,
you know, not using the

483
00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:22.610
same passwords for banking and
for your email is one

484
00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:25.130
of the things that we
always do. Yeah. I have

485
00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:27.980
heard some people say to
take some aspect of the

486
00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:31.040
domain, like some I've heard,
this is a not a

487
00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:33.680
good idea. People will take,
they'll take their skeleton to

488
00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:36.890
password. I have to shift
myself. I know, hang on,

489
00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:40.310
hang on. So the first,
the initial recommendation was, Oh,

490
00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:43.120
we'll take your, and then
add like Amazon at the

491
00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:46.960
end, except that's obvious. Okay.
But what you could do

492
00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:49.690
is you could take like,
just brainstorming here, like the

493
00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:53.830
second and third characters of
the, of the, of the

494
00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:55.990
domain. So you might have
a skeleton key password except

495
00:29:55.990 --> 00:30:00.010
you add in like M
a for Amazon or I

496
00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:02.860
see for Microsoft, you're taking
some aspect of the domain.

497
00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:05.170
That's easy to remember for
you and you're incorporating it

498
00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:09.040
into your larger key. It's
not ideal because you should

499
00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:12.100
have a completely unique one
for everything, but the Right.

500
00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:14.400
But I see what you're
saying. I definitely follow what

501
00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:17.250
you're saying You use, or
do you recommend that people

502
00:30:17.250 --> 00:30:20.520
use something like last pass
or first password or one

503
00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:26.850
of those password managers? Yeah.
I often when conducting these

504
00:30:27.810 --> 00:30:32.970
security talks and you know,
we talk about different passwords

505
00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:37.200
and we go through the
level one from using special

506
00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:40.650
symbols and length all the
way down to using special

507
00:30:40.650 --> 00:30:45.480
applications such as last pass
and so forth. Yeah. So

508
00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:47.550
I definitely do recommend that
and I think it does

509
00:30:47.550 --> 00:30:53.700
have a lot of value
to it. Yeah. And what

510
00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:55.650
last thing I wanted to
ask you about was talking

511
00:30:55.650 --> 00:30:59.460
about botnets. The, the could
have could arm, could I,

512
00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:01.200
could my machine be a
botnet right now? I mean,

513
00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:05.430
how would I know It
depends on a few different

514
00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:12.180
things such as if you
have the latest antivirus on

515
00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:15.420
your system and it's updated.
One of the things that

516
00:31:15.510 --> 00:31:18.870
I often see, someone may
have some sort of malware

517
00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:22.800
on their system and they
stated they do have an

518
00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:26.340
antivirus, but when you go
and you hit update, the

519
00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:28.980
last time the antivirus was
updated was about two, three

520
00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:32.400
months ago. So just having
an antivirus on the system

521
00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:34.770
is half the battle. The
other half is making sure

522
00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:37.560
that it is updated and
that you have the operating

523
00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:42.480
system updates available. If that's
the case. And that particular

524
00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:49.710
botnet signature has been identified,
then yes, you should be

525
00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:53.340
able to find it. But
there are botnets out there

526
00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:58.020
that are quiet. And these
antivirus companies have not been

527
00:31:58.020 --> 00:32:03.480
able to identify a signature
and many people do have

528
00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:07.080
botnets and Trojans and not
just end users. They've been

529
00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:12.930
fortune 100 companies that had
malware sitting on their systems

530
00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:17.010
for over a year. And
it hasn't been identified because

531
00:32:17.010 --> 00:32:21.060
the signature by the antivirus
companies have not been released.

532
00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:25.710
So I would say 80%
of the times, maybe a

533
00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:28.800
little higher, I'm just throwing
a number out there. But

534
00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:30.960
80% of the time, if
you do have an updated

535
00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:35.640
malware antivirus and your operating
system is updated, you will

536
00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:40.070
be able to determine that
you do have a, but

537
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:43.640
if, if you are a
part of that 10, 15,

538
00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:48.140
20% with dealing with a
new malware, sometimes you may

539
00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:51.860
not know until, you know,
later on in the field.

540
00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:54.100
Yeah. It's definitely the new
ones where you get nailed.

541
00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:57.010
I've had a couple of
machines that have had root

542
00:32:57.010 --> 00:32:58.930
kits on them, and it's
almost always been something that

543
00:32:58.930 --> 00:33:00.340
came out in the last
couple of weeks and it

544
00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:03.880
was just bad luck. But
lately I've been, I've been

545
00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:08.140
running without Adobe Acrobat, which
has a lot of vulnerabilities.

546
00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:11.500
I've been running without flash.
I use flash block my

547
00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:14.350
in Chrome. So I only
turn on flash when I

548
00:33:14.350 --> 00:33:17.350
need to watch a video.
So flash blocks on all

549
00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:19.390
the time. I find my
machine runs a lot faster

550
00:33:19.810 --> 00:33:22.270
when I'm browsing as well.
And I'm also avoiding, you

551
00:33:22.270 --> 00:33:24.760
know, drive by downloads or
just generally going to parts

552
00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:26.830
of the internet that you
really need to not be

553
00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:29.950
hanging out in it. Well,
I mean, the strange thing

554
00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:37.000
is even legit sites, you
know, kid sites are, you

555
00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.640
know, you do get affected
by drive by downloads as

556
00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:43.270
well. You know, it all
deals with the administration. If

557
00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:47.380
the system has a vulnerability.
So definitely, you know, going

558
00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:50.980
to shady sites, you're definitely
putting yourself at risk, but

559
00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:55.330
I've seen users just by
going to kids. Sites get

560
00:33:55.330 --> 00:33:59.110
hit as well. It's a
been, have been a compromise.

561
00:33:59.130 --> 00:34:01.750
So they, they, they, they
weren't shady before, but they're

562
00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:04.810
shady now What they say
or they deliver and shady

563
00:34:04.810 --> 00:34:09.370
material. Yeah, exactly. Well, thanks
for chatting with me today.

564
00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:12.370
Hey, it was my pleasure
and I just would like

565
00:34:12.370 --> 00:34:15.430
to definitely thank you for
introducing me to a zero

566
00:34:15.430 --> 00:34:20.290
day when we were at
blogging while Brown. I read

567
00:34:20.290 --> 00:34:22.930
that book. I liked it
a lot. I even had

568
00:34:22.930 --> 00:34:26.320
a chance to speak with
Mark about the book and

569
00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:29.080
I'm currently working on a
second book, Trojan horse right

570
00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:31.570
now and I'm just trying
to get ready. Cause I

571
00:34:31.570 --> 00:34:33.070
think he said the third
one is supposed to be

572
00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:35.200
coming out this summer. Yeah.
And yeah, you had him

573
00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:38.440
on the security orbs show
that security or you can

574
00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:43.630
listen to Caleb's interview with
Mark Russinovich. Exactly. All right.

575
00:34:43.630 --> 00:34:46.540
This has been another episode
of Hanselminutes and we'll see

576
00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:47.380
you again next week.
