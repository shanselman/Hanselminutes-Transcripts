From hanselminutes.com. It's Hansel minutes,
our weekly discussion with web

9
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.160
developer and technologists Scott Hanselman.
This is Lawrence Ryan announcing show

10
00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.480
number four 75. In this
episode, Scott talks with Steve

11
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:09.260
Lee about developing today's web
accessibility. Hi, this is Scott

12
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.690
Hanselman. This is another episode
of Hansel minutes, and I

13
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.600
am talking with Steve Lee
from open directive. We're gonna

14
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.780
talk about accessibility. Thanks for
coming on the show. Hi,

15
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.270
Scott. Nice to talk to
you. Yeah, I was really

16
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.540
excited to talk to you
because I really enjoy your

17
00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.000
slides and I've looked at
them for years and years

18
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.570
on accessibility and you actually
consulted for a while and

19
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.090
have continued to consult with
folks at the Mozilla foundation.

20
00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.940
So you have fingers in
all aspects of accessibility with

21
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.330
all the movers and shakers.
Oh, that's very nice of

22
00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.340
you to say so. Yes.
I mean, there was a

23
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.290
point a few years ago
when Mozilla were very much

24
00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.690
at the center of the
sort of open source web

25
00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.780
and genome accessibility, Colombe being
needed, Linux desktop. So, and

26
00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.370
I was very fortunate to
be involved in at that

27
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.400
time and learned an awful
lot about the whole, the

28
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.880
whole issues of accessibility from
the user to technical side.

29
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.420
It's a great time. Good
reason. Hopefully this is not

30
00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.480
a inappropriate thing to ask
that you are interested in

31
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.410
accessibility. I got interested because
I was legally blind for

32
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.280
a time, and then I
had my surgery. And during

33
00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.070
that time I met with
some accessibility experts in New York

34
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.320
and use a screen reader
and learned about high contrast

35
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.820
and things like that. So
it was a passion of

36
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:26.750
mine. Are you anything other
than able bodied? No, I

37
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.800
think w when I left
college, I thought ergonomics as

38
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.450
it was then called will
be a really cool field

39
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.160
to get in, but I
completely failed to get into

40
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.800
that field and did embedded
design. And then I sort

41
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.480
of had a bit of
a midlife crisis thinking what

42
00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.180
I really want to do.
And I decided accessibility was

43
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.500
a, a good cause. Very
interesting. I do have some

44
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.350
very minor mental health issues,
I suppose, like a lot

45
00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.070
of people do. But apart
from that, no, there's nothing.

46
00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.270
Well, okay. I'm coming up
to 50. So I'm collecting,

47
00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.920
like we all do various
disabilities RSI. It's fading a

48
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.660
bit. Hearing's going public. I've
had hand surgery as well.

49
00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.630
So 20, 20, 25 years
of typing on a keyboard,

50
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.540
one appreciates accessibility. And hockey's
a nice ergonomic mouse. Yeah.

51
00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.910
It makes a huge difference.
Even just moving the position

52
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.280
of the mouse can make
a big difference. I've seen

53
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.400
it in your presentations that
you feel extremely strongly about

54
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.130
this idea of universal accessibility.
It's not one kind of

55
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.370
accessibility that you're interested in.
You're interested in everyone having

56
00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.840
accessible web technology. Yeah, absolutely.
And that that's part of

57
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.210
what I was thinking about.
What we might talk about.

58
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:41.130
That was a came to
a conclusion that accessibility is,

59
00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.070
is part of user experience.
That that's a big part

60
00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.430
of it. So when you're
thinking about user experience, you'd

61
00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.640
need to think about the
wider picture. One way of

62
00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.740
thinking of it is don't
make assumptions about how people

63
00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.530
are going to access your
content and use your, you

64
00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.770
use your functionality. There was
a point where everybody had

65
00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:03.750
a desktop of a mouse
keyboard and a 17 inch

66
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.420
monitor in those days. Of
course we made assumptions and

67
00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.580
a lot of people with
disability suffered as a result.

68
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.030
Now we're in a situation
where there's this plethora of

69
00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.740
devices, different form factors used
in different contexts. People want

70
00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:20.100
to do things, have their
own preferences. And, and suddenly

71
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.240
accessibility is sort of a
big problem for everyone. And

72
00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.940
I guess that's where I'm
coming at. The, the phrase

73
00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.810
that came to me is
personalization. That's really part of

74
00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.550
what he's about a few
years ago, there was a

75
00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.360
big debate and people disability
said, no accessibility should be

76
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.060
about making sure we're not
left out in the dark,

77
00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.480
which did happen of course,
but, but I think, I

78
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.050
mean, that is absolutely critical
that that that doesn't happen.

79
00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.070
But also there's this bigger
issue of making sure it's,

80
00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.630
everybody can access everything. I
think it's a bit of

81
00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.460
a cliche, but I have
to say, when you meet

82
00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.650
someone who is not able
to get to your content,

83
00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.190
it has a tendency to
make one passionate towards getting

84
00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.650
people that content. I spoke
to a number of a

85
00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.030
number of deaf people who
enjoy this podcast. So we

86
00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.100
have gone out of our
way to have transcripts made

87
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.160
contest. And I've done that
with my, with my, my

88
00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:17.400
YouTube videos as well. I
met, I have a number

89
00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.960
of, I actually have two,
two good friends who are

90
00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.590
blind and every single time
I write a blog post,

91
00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.620
I think about the Alta
tag and all, sometimes I'll

92
00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.680
bury a little secret note
in there for my blind

93
00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.880
readers as well. I think
that for the, for the

94
00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:34.530
most of us, we think
of all tags. That's kind

95
00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.900
of like the, the, the
most simplistic thing when we

96
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.910
think of accessibility is like,
Oh, that picture should have

97
00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.180
a description. Yup. Yeah. Th
that, that is one of

98
00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.730
the common ones. And part
of that, I guess, is

99
00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:47.360
going back to this concept
of accessibility for everyone, the,

100
00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.180
the visually impaired group, if
you can call them a

101
00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.300
group because everybody's different in
a combination of disabilities that

102
00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.800
goes, but they've had a
lot allowed lobbying. And a

103
00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.670
lot of the accessibility effort
should I say, has been

104
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:06.170
to make sure that the
visually impaired are well catered

105
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:09.830
for, but, but there are
other areas as well. And

106
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.490
sorry, the, the old tag
obviously is forgiving an alternative

107
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.990
description to images. And that's
part of not making assumptions.

108
00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:20.420
Again, you can't assume how
people are going to consume

109
00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:23.900
your content. Some, some people
won't be looking at it.

110
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.890
So screw, they have a
good experience. And that's one

111
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:30.800
that one of a number
of different things that there's

112
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.990
some low, some easy things
you can do to make

113
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:35.330
sure that everything is accessible
to as wide a number

114
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.450
of people as possible. A
couple of things I'd like

115
00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:41.150
to say that people should
do is throw away the

116
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.550
mouse, try and use just
the keyboard. That is a

117
00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:46.310
really good one. Can you
get, can you, yeah. Can

118
00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:50.450
you get around your, your
web app or your site

119
00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:55.190
with just the keyboard we're
using the tab key and

120
00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:59.230
the space key to move
and to select Fine motor

121
00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:01.810
control involved in positioning, the
mouse is not available to

122
00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:05.170
everyone. Yes. Well, he works
in a different, the mouse

123
00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:07.360
is sort of be like,
if you're fairly technical, is

124
00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.400
it a sort of random
access you can access anywhere

125
00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.320
on the screen, but it'd
be using the keyboard. You

126
00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:14.290
have to move sequentially through
it. And the point where

127
00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:16.120
the keyboard is one, there
was some people who just

128
00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.130
liked to use their keyboard.
They don't like to use

129
00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:20.680
a mouse, power users, if
you like. And I'm one

130
00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.690
of those people who tend
to want to use the

131
00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:28.150
keyboard more and also lots
of different assisted technologies, which

132
00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:33.350
are ways of that. People
with disabilities may access the

133
00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:37.960
computer. They hang off the
keyboard. The, the common one

134
00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:42.250
is the screen reader. So
blind people, they, they, they

135
00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:44.230
can't, they can't use a
master point anywhere on the

136
00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:47.170
screens and those see what's
going on. So you have

137
00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:49.870
to tab with the keyboard
around. And what happens is

138
00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:53.740
it speaks out information about
where you are at that

139
00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:57.040
particular point in the user
interface. So they're probably the

140
00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:01.510
two main reasons, the rather
other assisted technologies, perhaps those

141
00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:05.650
used for people physical disabilities,
which automatically move a cursor

142
00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:08.560
around and they can select
it with us over simple,

143
00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:12.460
just press a switch type
operation, again, that that all

144
00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:16.780
wants to drive your, your,
your web app or website

145
00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:20.830
through keyboard commands. So it's
a really gate picks. If

146
00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:22.360
you can get a really
good experience with just the

147
00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.340
keyboard, you're going to hit
a lot of, lot of

148
00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.950
different users. The thing that
you said that resonated with

149
00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:30.850
me the most was the
assumption of random access. That's

150
00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:35.080
what I tell you, Kiki,
perhaps, but One aspect of

151
00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:38.110
that, but the assumption that
the individual can, can access

152
00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:41.170
any aspect of it, anything
that's on the screen assumes

153
00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:42.580
that there's a touch screen,
that they can move their

154
00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:44.890
arm in a certain way.
But if they're filling out

155
00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:48.220
a form as you're hitting
tab, if you have an

156
00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:50.320
element on the screen that
doesn't really need to have

157
00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.870
focus, but you didn't think
about that ahead of time

158
00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:55.500
as a programmer, then that's
a roadblock. That's just an

159
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:57.990
unnecessary element that is sitting
there with focus. And there's

160
00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:01.310
no reason for it. Yes.
That, that that's quite right.

161
00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:04.370
Yeah. So there's a lot
of complexity about that, of

162
00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:06.380
course. But if you can
get the basic and I'm

163
00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:07.760
one of the things is
don't mess with a tab

164
00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.830
index. You can set a
tab index on everything on

165
00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:12.950
the website. The default tab
index is good. He does

166
00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:15.890
tend to flow the document
structure, follow the document structure,

167
00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:17.720
but normally that's good. If
you start messing with the

168
00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:22.070
tab index, for some particular
reason, you can really make

169
00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:25.350
the user experience horrible for
people with assisted technology. So

170
00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:29.330
Now when I use different
controls, like, you know, just

171
00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:32.690
radio buttons and regular buttons,
those are standard HTML controls,

172
00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:34.730
but you know, often I'll
have a boss who wants

173
00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:37.970
a fan fancy date, time
down. Is that a bad

174
00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:42.260
thing for accessibility? Yes and
no. If you, if you

175
00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.650
use a builtin browser controls,
if you use the controls

176
00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:49.490
in a framework which has
had accessibility baked into it,

177
00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.910
then you get all of
the accessibility in there. So

178
00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:55.940
the keyboard access will work.
It will work with touch.

179
00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:58.430
It will work with, well,
it should work with touch.

180
00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:02.240
It will work with mouse
pointers. It does depend on

181
00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.780
how much effort is being
put in in there. Microsoft

182
00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:07.820
at the moment, I'm very
impressed with their, their, their

183
00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:11.720
effort to handle multiple devices
and input modes is really

184
00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:14.330
looking very interesting at the
moment. But, but there's a,

185
00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:16.850
there's an industry interest in
this mainly because of touch

186
00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:19.970
screens. But the point is,
as soon as you start

187
00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:23.390
creating your, your, your boss
says he wants a fancy

188
00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:27.110
widget. I though say a
circular menu or something like

189
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:29.060
that. And you end up
designing that, creating it from

190
00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:31.850
lots of div tags and
bits and pieces. You're going

191
00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:34.700
to have to do all
that accessibility, work yourself. And

192
00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:38.180
there's lots of educators and
gotchas that you won't find

193
00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:41.060
until they come in as
bugs. So you really, you

194
00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:44.150
know, use the standard controllers
if you can. It doesn't

195
00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:47.540
mean you shouldn't do the
fun stuff, but, and web

196
00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:50.810
components, because as an area
where there's lots of excitements

197
00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:55.700
at the moment, they're not
really ready for production use,

198
00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:58.160
but they will come. I
think there's so much noise

199
00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.360
about them. But the point
is there is a, you

200
00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:04.970
can basically create a wizzy
widget and encapsulate it in

201
00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:10.220
a nice little piece of
functionality anyone can include. But

202
00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:12.320
of course, if there's all
these widgets out there and

203
00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:16.700
they haven't had accessibility love
put into them, then there's

204
00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:19.190
going to be an issue
for your users. So in

205
00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:21.650
the old days of when
32, I know that you

206
00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:23.840
had some wind 32 experiences
as well. So I think

207
00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:27.170
similar generation in that respect,
we would have what we

208
00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:30.320
called owner draw controls, the,
who we asked, just like,

209
00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:35.000
here's a rectangle go nuts.
Yeah. And WM pay messages

210
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.950
and all that sort of
stuff. Exactly. A similar thing

211
00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:38.720
exists on the web. Doesn't
it. If I decide to

212
00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.270
go and do something beautiful
in a canvas, what does

213
00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:44.870
that in air quotes? What
does that look like to

214
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:46.640
an accessibility? Is it just
a black hole in the

215
00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:49.220
middle of the page? That's
a really good question. If

216
00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:52.520
you go back in the
early days of accessibility, when

217
00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:55.510
every, just drew on the
screen, as it liked, there

218
00:11:55.510 --> 00:12:00.160
was no way for assisted
technology to, to say so.

219
00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:02.650
So the concept of assisted
technology, if you like, is

220
00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:05.590
it takes the user interface
you've got and modifies it

221
00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:07.540
in a way for a
user and the classic cases

222
00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:10.830
of screen reader. So it
transfers what's on the screen

223
00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:14.650
into text. As a user
moves around, that's a transformation

224
00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:17.800
on your user interface in
order to reflect, it needs

225
00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.200
to know what the, what
the user interface is like,

226
00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.360
what its structure is that
there is a button with

227
00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:24.370
some text on it so
that it can read it

228
00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:27.180
to the user. When everybody
was just writing to this

229
00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:30.340
screen, there's a bit map.
There's no way that you

230
00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:33.190
could work that out and
assist you. Technology writers have

231
00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:34.900
a hell of a job
to try. And, and they

232
00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:38.740
had tricks called virtual buffets
where they try to capture

233
00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:40.690
everything the screen was doing
and figure out what was

234
00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:43.390
going on. And it's exactly
the same with the canvas

235
00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:46.510
on the web. Now, if
you decide to write a

236
00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:50.770
text editor that does everything
in the canvas, there's no

237
00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:52.090
way you can get at
a text. Cause there's just

238
00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:55.240
a bunch of pixels on
the canvas. And they does

239
00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:58.300
have some accessibility extensors now
to add that information back

240
00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:02.050
in, but yes, a canvas
is, is sexy and you

241
00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:04.600
can do some amazing stuff,
especially if you're using ass.

242
00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:09.100
So ASM and, and the
web GL or all these

243
00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:11.410
graphics stuff. It's really like
the good old days of

244
00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:14.430
graphics on, on the screen
extend this. But I don't

245
00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:16.950
think, I think that a
blind, a blind web browser

246
00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:20.520
person can probably appreciate the
technology behind like quake in

247
00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:22.530
a browser, but they're not
as much interested in that,

248
00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:25.560
but they would like to
get their email and do

249
00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:28.740
pay, do their banking. What
kind of tooling is there

250
00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:32.790
to validate something from a
technical perspective? Okay, well, there's,

251
00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:36.360
there's, there's a whole range
of stuff. Really. I would

252
00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:39.960
say that you can't be
real user testing. Cause people

253
00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:42.660
do crazy stuff and it's,
you know, they're their use.

254
00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:45.780
If you see a screen
reader user, they, they, Oh,

255
00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:47.610
this is credible. You can't
tell what they're doing. They're

256
00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:50.790
so fast and this, so
that's the first thing to

257
00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:53.250
say, but there are stuff
to get the technical validation

258
00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:55.470
in there to make sure
that you've done all this

259
00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:59.700
stuff you can possible. There
are online validators, W3C have

260
00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:02.070
one. The new kid on
the block is tenon, which

261
00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:05.040
is a very interesting one
that's designed for modern workflows.

262
00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:07.290
So if you're using grunt
and gulp and all that

263
00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:10.050
sort of stuff to build
your, your friends and then

264
00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:14.100
it will hook in nicely
with that. There are also

265
00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:18.120
some accessibility, toolbars. There's one
from the past yellow group.

266
00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:21.960
That's a windows only one,
I think, but, but there's

267
00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:24.180
other things you can do.
And I mentioned using the

268
00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:28.500
keyboard, but most operating systems
have a built in the

269
00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:34.560
ration system. Windows has no
raters. There's voiceover on iOS

270
00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:38.640
and OSX is 10 and
Orca is the one on

271
00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.860
Linux. And you can, you
can, you don't need to

272
00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:43.020
be a major screen reader
user, but you can play

273
00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:45.060
around with those and get
an idea of what is

274
00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:49.860
like to, to, to, to
operate that way. I really

275
00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:52.910
think that people need to
do this. People need to

276
00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:55.460
actually give this a try
and, you know, I think

277
00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:56.870
you're very kind to say
we should, you know, you

278
00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:58.130
play with that with that
and get an idea of

279
00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:01.400
what it works like seriously,
turn off your monitor, pick

280
00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:04.790
up, pick a random Friday,
call it accessibility Friday, turn

281
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:06.950
off your monitor and try
to get something done for

282
00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:13.950
eight solid hours. You know
what I mean? <inaudible> your

283
00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:18.580
laptop. And just listen and
you'll watch. They will listen

284
00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:21.400
to it in their, in
a headphones. And once a

285
00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.350
week I saw a number
of people. I worked with

286
00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:27.820
the accessible, they were called
the associated blind of New York.

287
00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:29.620
They had a whole department
where they would go and

288
00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:32.890
do web testing and they
speed up the audio so

289
00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:40.390
fast that it's unintelligible. They
can understand it. Yeah, well

290
00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:42.970
that's and what's very interesting
is the very old screen

291
00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:45.850
readers that sounded very robotic
rather than these really natural

292
00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:48.220
voices, which you can get
now are preferred because you

293
00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:50.350
can speed them up. And
because it hasn't got all

294
00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:53.080
the inflections, they either work
really fast and rapidly, but

295
00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:56.230
yeah, it's amazing. Yeah. There's,
there's w we can think

296
00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:59.230
about it as something binary,
either sighted or blind, but

297
00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:02.110
there's so many things in
between. My boss is color

298
00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:04.510
blind and he'll red, green
color blind he'll have issues,

299
00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:08.140
or you might need high
contrast. So it isn't just

300
00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:10.540
a, Hey, we handled it
for the blind it's done.

301
00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:13.750
Is it Absolutely not? No.
And any interest enough, 10%

302
00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:16.870
of the male population are
colorblind red, green. So that's

303
00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:19.450
a big number really. And
yet it's so easy not

304
00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:22.900
to think about your, the
contrast or the colors that

305
00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:25.150
you use Love to put
circles that are red and

306
00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:30.280
green to yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
I always joke about red

307
00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:34.810
green refactor or gray, gray
refactor, depending on your level

308
00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:41.140
of colorblindness. So these toolbars
there for the cited though,

309
00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:45.590
to validate that something has
been been annotated correctly, They're

310
00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:49.480
a test tool. So they
allow you to browse around

311
00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:52.660
a website or indeed a
web app and, and perform

312
00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:56.140
various tests. The, the, the
one I was thinking about

313
00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:59.920
the Pestello group one was
Steve Faulkner. Who's the mighty

314
00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:01.750
state folk folk that you
always have to say the

315
00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:05.380
mighty before his name. He
does a lot of, or

316
00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:08.710
they do a lot of
web validation for customers, corporate

317
00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:10.960
customers. And obviously there's a
lot of things you do

318
00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:12.910
again and again. And so
he created the toolbar for

319
00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:15.670
his own use, but so
is it has in it

320
00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:22.840
a color contrast checker and,
and, and things like that.

321
00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:25.660
Yeah. And so the whole
bunch of tools like that,

322
00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:27.820
you can check one of
the important things to get

323
00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:29.830
the game. One of these
low hanging fruit is get

324
00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:33.190
the structure of your document
really clear by using some

325
00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:36.970
of the new HMO five
tags or there's landmarks in

326
00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:41.500
way, Aria. I want to
take a moment to thank

ebook today. So you said

336
00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:24.660
Aria, if you don't mind,
let's dig into that. Because

337
00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:26.550
when I was coming up,
there was a couple of

338
00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:29.100
attributes. There was the all
tag in the United States. There

339
00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:30.870
was a thing called section
five Oh eight. That was

340
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:34.230
a checklist, but now what
is Aria? A R I

341
00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:38.800
a? Okay. So I was
effectively extension to HTML and,

342
00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:42.440
and now it actually is
effectively part of it, which

343
00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:47.390
is good, but for accessibility
purposes, and this is sifted

344
00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:49.490
technology, as I mentioned, you
sometimes have to get a

345
00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:53.720
little bit more information so
that it can pass it

346
00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:57.140
on to users. One of
the important things for screen

347
00:18:57.140 --> 00:18:59.720
reader users is the structure
of the documents so that

348
00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:03.050
they can navigate around really
quickly, in fact, screen readers.

349
00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:05.210
And it would be really
useful for sighted users can

350
00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:06.800
give them a list of
all the headings and they

351
00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:09.260
can move from one heading
to the other. In fact,

352
00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:11.330
one web browser did do
that one. So the thing

353
00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:16.130
to remember, but so, so
there's these various, another thing

354
00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:18.080
is if something pops up
in the corner of the

355
00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:21.080
screen, if you're sighted, you
see it. Although often it

356
00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:24.650
disappears before you read it.
That's another accessibility issue, but

357
00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:29.720
if you're blind and you're
moving around the keyboard and

358
00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:32.060
it speaking what you're saying,
it won't be speaking, something

359
00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:34.670
that pops up. So you
may miss it completely. So

360
00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:38.270
there's the stuff, the extra
tags, which allow you to

361
00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:41.870
say, let the user know
about this when it, when

362
00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:44.900
I display it. So it's
really just a whole bunch

363
00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:48.620
of things that allay to
improve the accessibility, just put

364
00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:50.750
a few little tags, and
they're quite easy to apply

365
00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:53.060
That example, right there. Let's
say that you had a

366
00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:55.340
div that popped up. We
would call that a piece

367
00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:59.630
of toast, the toast somewhere
That day, just to find

368
00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:02.000
out what that meant. You
have a piece of toast

369
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.870
that pops up that maybe
goes and becomes visible. That

370
00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:09.080
is an assertion that's being
that's happening. And someone's going

371
00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:10.790
to notice that because they're
going to their eye will

372
00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:14.060
be drawn there. But if
I understand correctly in Aria,

373
00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:17.810
you would say that the
role of this div is

374
00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:20.420
one of an alert. And
then you would say that

375
00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:23.420
this is an assertive alert,
indicating that you wanted spoken

376
00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:26.240
immediately. You want to interrupt
the user and say, Hey,

377
00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:30.020
you went offline or whatever,
That's it? Yeah. There's two

378
00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:32.030
aspects. There's one is say
it isn't the alert. And

379
00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:37.190
then because the user, again,
it's a user preference, partly

380
00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:39.950
because your user can say,
I only want to hear

381
00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:43.520
really important alerts. I don't
want to be interrupted. And

382
00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:46.250
obviously it speaks absolutely everything.
It's hard for the user

383
00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:48.400
to filter it out. And
so this is a lovely

384
00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:51.790
term. You can say, it's
Aria. I can't remember the

385
00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:55.810
attribute name, but it's polite.
The alive live. Thank you.

386
00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:00.490
It, plight is one of
the values where it says,

387
00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:03.100
don't interrupt what the user's
doing, unless they're doing nothing.

388
00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:06.690
And then you can tell
them No, for the, for

389
00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:08.910
the folks that are listening,
who don't understand what we've

390
00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:12.840
just been saying. As far
as Aria it's w AI

391
00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:17.190
a R I a it's
the web accessibility initiative and

392
00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:23.370
Aria stands for what, Ah,
there, you got me accessibility.

393
00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:29.850
Rich, is it rich internet
applications? I said it was

394
00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:33.450
coming to the days where
we had dynamic HTML and

395
00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:37.470
rich and yeah. Yeah. So
it's accessible That application. So

396
00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:39.810
when we that's, when we
say Aria, we're talking about

397
00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:42.150
all of those attributes and
the, all of the specification

398
00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:45.570
around that. Now these are
almost like a sidecar to

399
00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:47.490
all the different tags that
you can have with an

400
00:21:47.490 --> 00:21:51.720
HTML five. Right? So yes,
Yes and no, except some

401
00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:54.090
of them have come in
in like, like for example,

402
00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:56.880
one of the earlier tags
was required, which allows when

403
00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:59.070
you've got a form, some
of the fields you want

404
00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:01.770
that are required, you need
to use it to fill

405
00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:05.370
them in. And there was
an REO attribute called required,

406
00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:07.560
and now that's gone into
HMO five, so you can

407
00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:11.820
move out. But, but initially,
because it was an extension,

408
00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:14.730
the way, way Aria was,
you know, extra tags that

409
00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:17.550
you could use and gradually
they they're, a lot of

410
00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:20.520
them are getting moved into
the main spec. So It

411
00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:21.720
seems like we shouldn't think
about it. This is a

412
00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:24.450
car, this is HTML five,
and it should be required

413
00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:27.840
in any, any basic document.
Yeah, I think so. And

414
00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:30.090
given that there, isn't such
a thing as HTML five,

415
00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:33.270
anyways, a mess of different
specs and technologies and API

416
00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:36.030
APIs. I think that's a
very valid way of looking

417
00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:39.570
at it. Yeah. I've found
in creating forms that just

418
00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:43.380
the least that we can
do is using described by.

419
00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:46.110
So if you have a
text box and then some

420
00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:49.230
div or label somewhere, just
to say, Hey, this text

421
00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:54.510
box has a relationship with
this div or this, this

422
00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:56.310
tech, this other piece of
text. So then when you

423
00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:59.520
click on it, you can
pop something up. That explains

424
00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:03.270
what is this thing? Yes,
there's a description tag and

425
00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:05.430
there's, there was a big
furore about that one recently,

426
00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:06.720
or a lot of, sorry,
that's a long desk and

427
00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:09.000
get assigned mixed up. But
yeah, so there's two there's

428
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.340
label buyers, one of, one
of the good ones. And

429
00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:14.250
that's, again, it's just getting
the structure of your markup.

430
00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:20.610
Good. And there's actually excited
users. If you use the

431
00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:23.610
labels properly to label your
controls, people click on the

432
00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:27.240
labels, as well as the
actual control and start interacting

433
00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:30.030
with them In this world
of like you said, DHL,

434
00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:33.180
or, you know, really, really
JavaScript rich applications. There's a

435
00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:36.420
lot of what I refer
to generally as accordions, you

436
00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:39.210
know, things that open and
close when we were, you

437
00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:40.830
know, in the early nineties,
it was like, Oh, the

438
00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:43.410
first tree control we'd ever
seen, Oh my goodness. It

439
00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:46.430
can collapse and expand, but
all sorts of dibs are

440
00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:50.300
expanding and collapsing. How do
you describe that to a

441
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:55.600
two, a two with Aria?
We've got me there, Scott,

442
00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:58.420
I guess what I'm trying
to understand is there's Aria

443
00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:02.110
expanded and Aria hidden. Oh,
so yes. Are these things

444
00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:06.370
that are, that, that the
screen reader understands and then

445
00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:10.330
expresses in some way to
the user? Yes, absolutely. I

446
00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:12.370
mean, the, the whole point
of all of the Aria

447
00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:17.020
of all the Aria tags
is, is that they pass

448
00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:19.390
information on to the screen
readers. And that has been

449
00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:22.090
the, sorry, I'm not directly
answering your question. I've gained

450
00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:24.340
a little bit. So is
that because I'm interested in

451
00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:27.310
the context, because I assume
that every screen reader has

452
00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:29.560
a, has a style of
presenting the information. There's no

453
00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:32.080
standard way. And just as
you made the really interesting

454
00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:35.020
point, which wasn't obvious to
me was that the user

455
00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:38.290
can express their level of
interest. Like maybe I only

456
00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:40.210
want alerts or maybe I
only want things. I want

457
00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:44.710
everything I want verbose. Yeah.
Yeah. There's a stack of

458
00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:48.220
technology here and making it
all work is involves collaboration.

459
00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:50.530
And we're moving to a
world now where folks say

460
00:24:50.530 --> 00:24:54.190
that open standards and open
source that's happening. Whereas the

461
00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:57.160
assisted technology makers used to
get virtually no help from

462
00:24:57.160 --> 00:25:00.340
the operating system vendors or
the browser people, you know,

463
00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:02.020
so they had to go
off and do their own

464
00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:05.470
thing. So when it comes
to something like the RA

465
00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:11.320
expanded there's, someone has to
despair is developed, or the

466
00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:13.720
spec isn't developed in isolation
in that you need to

467
00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:16.660
work with the browser developers.
And Amber Zillow has been

468
00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:18.790
one of the, one of
the good ones. And now

469
00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:23.650
we've to see Microsoft joining
and, and Google as well

470
00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:27.130
in a webcast. And often
these things get tried in

471
00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:30.700
the browsers, but also the
sister technology manufacturers need to

472
00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:32.740
be involved in this as
well. And, and it's a

473
00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:36.460
two way street cause assisted
technology manufacturers will say, Hey,

474
00:25:36.550 --> 00:25:39.250
our users really need this
feature, but we can't do

475
00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:42.610
it. So it might get
included. They hopefully they are

476
00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:46.780
involved in, in the spec
standards, bodies and the browser,

477
00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:51.520
many people also on those
working groups. So everybody needs

478
00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:54.070
to work together basis and
to get a good experience

479
00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:56.020
for the users is what
this is all about course.

480
00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:58.750
And the Aria, the thing
that I thought was most

481
00:25:58.750 --> 00:26:00.760
interesting about Aria, and it
really is actually of all

482
00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:02.470
of the different specs, one
of the easier ones to

483
00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:05.050
read, frankly, I think it's
actually quite interesting to read.

484
00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:07.420
Yeah. And there's some good,
very good support materials as

485
00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:09.580
well. That is worth saying
actually, if you go to

486
00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:12.460
the Wii landing page, which
is the place to go

487
00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:14.980
to pick up all these
specs, not only have you

488
00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:16.840
got the specs and work
egg, which is like the

489
00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:20.350
master spec telling you how
to do every WCA CAG

490
00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:24.730
yet, which stands for web
content, accessibility guidelines. There's also

491
00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:27.280
one for web authoring tools
as well, but that doesn't

492
00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:32.060
get much attention. That's a
very long detailed spec and

493
00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:34.000
they sort of something you
want for bedtime reading, but

494
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:39.430
there are, so there are
a number of techniques documents,

495
00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:41.720
which say, this is how
you apply this stuff. And

496
00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:45.870
now also the, the educational
brands, which is Shadi and

497
00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:49.050
Eric are from the W3C,
are creating a number of

498
00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:54.000
great tutorials. So there's stuff
there. There's also web team

499
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.830
or another company worth mentioning
having some very good introductory

500
00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:03.500
information. And I looked at
a lovely example from Hayden

501
00:27:04.550 --> 00:27:08.870
at Hayden works. There's practical
Aria examples. And it's basically

502
00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:12.530
like, you know, here here's
a hamburger like the, you

503
00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:15.860
know, the legendary hamburger menu.
What exactly should that look

504
00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:18.860
like marked marked up? And
here's a dropdown. And this

505
00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:22.490
got me into the, the
area spec and I was

506
00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:26.720
reading about roles. So roles
are where you say this

507
00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:29.150
div is a toolbar and
that div is an alert

508
00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:32.120
dialogue. And then that's a
little, that's the magic piece

509
00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:35.500
of context that people need.
Yes, that's right. I mean,

510
00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:38.300
there's going back to your
question about, you know, your

511
00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:41.900
boss asks you to make
something up. You, you can

512
00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:43.520
do it. You can, you
can create a menu out

513
00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:46.630
of 100 deaths, dibs. If
you want to make your

514
00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:48.620
life really hard, you'll probably
usually list the elements or

515
00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:53.060
something, but they're not conceptually,
they're not a list. There

516
00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:56.840
are menu, but the assisted
technology, the screen reader can't

517
00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:59.210
know that. And so this
is one of the key

518
00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:01.400
points of Aria is one
of the key little bits

519
00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:04.760
of extra information that it
gives the assisted technology. Is

520
00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:09.980
that what this, or what
this bouncer dibs that you,

521
00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:12.470
you know, what they are
they using? The visceral sighted

522
00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:16.660
user knows what they are
because you can Intuit it

523
00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:19.460
by this plate, interacting with
it. But the, the say

524
00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:22.280
the non-visual user won't have
using a screen reader won't

525
00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:24.200
know. Cause it would just
be there, just be told

526
00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:26.270
it's a bunch of Dave's.
So this extra little hint

527
00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:29.930
of bit of information lets
lets them interact with it.

528
00:28:30.050 --> 00:28:32.990
Let's lets a screen reader
processes and provide a good

529
00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:36.320
interaction for the user. Something
else that you were passionate

530
00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:38.090
about that I'd like you
to explain to me is

531
00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:43.280
this global public inclusive infrastructure.
Right? Okay. So this is

532
00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:45.740
so, so one of the
problems and we mentioned that

533
00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:47.630
all of these players need
to work together to get

534
00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:50.800
a good user experience for
users, but there's not, there's

535
00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:53.630
such a long way for
such a long way, shorter

536
00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:56.090
where we'd like to be.
So there's a real need

537
00:28:56.090 --> 00:28:59.420
to help everybody work together.
And that the GPI is

538
00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:04.070
this big, massive vision to
make, make accessibility work really.

539
00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:07.700
And there were three, three
areas to it. One is

540
00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:11.660
to help users who often
don't, aren't technical and don't

541
00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:13.550
have a clue about what
stuff's out there that might

542
00:29:13.550 --> 00:29:16.700
be useful for them, help
them to find stuff and

543
00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:20.630
configure it for the best
experience for them personalization. Again,

544
00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:24.710
the other stuff is to
help developers find out about

545
00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:29.540
staff, to maybe find use
of open source libraries, to

546
00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:32.630
basically implement accessibility in the
best possible ways. And the

547
00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:36.530
third way, which is really
quite exciting is an infrastructure

548
00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:40.250
for automatic personalization. The vision
is you can go to

549
00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:44.920
any computer, any kiosk, any
phone, and it would be

550
00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:47.440
matched in the best possible
way to your preferences. So

551
00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:51.670
if you want high contrast
screen, you want big text

552
00:29:51.850 --> 00:29:54.190
where every device you go
to that that will happen.

553
00:29:54.490 --> 00:30:00.220
And the idea is to
provide an infrastructure which in

554
00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:05.080
which we'll know those, your
preferences and will perform the

555
00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:08.020
best match with the device
capabilities to give you the

556
00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:11.100
best experience. I see You
carry with you, this, this

557
00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:15.120
roaming profile of your accessibility
needs and the device adapts

558
00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:17.480
as appropriate to those needs.
No, the idea is that

559
00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:19.770
it's actually stored on the
cloud and obviously there's lots

560
00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:23.160
of security, privacy issues like
that as, as always. But

561
00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:26.400
that Valley way would be
one approach is you could

562
00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:29.730
have your own device, your
own remote control, configured to

563
00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:32.310
how you like. And you
talked to the device, this

564
00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:35.280
is a different approach. This
is the approach that when

565
00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:40.590
you go to say a
ticket kiosk, you identify yourself

566
00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:43.590
to it. In some various
ways. One, the, one of

567
00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:45.450
the trial techniques we've got
is a ring with an

568
00:30:45.450 --> 00:30:48.510
RFID tagging. And you just
go and I can read

569
00:30:48.510 --> 00:30:51.660
that and it knows who
you are. It goes off

570
00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:55.080
to the cloud. You've already
spent time saying what your

571
00:30:55.380 --> 00:31:00.330
preferred configuration is. I want
a big text. And, and

572
00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:04.470
the, the cloud, the infrastructure
talks to the device you're

573
00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:08.220
on and says, what's what
capabilities have you got for

574
00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:12.360
big texts that, that set
the best possible one closest

575
00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:15.720
to this user once. So
it works that way rather

576
00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:19.320
than the way I suggested
I thing of course, that

577
00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:22.830
that beginning part really is
an implementation detail. They could

578
00:31:22.830 --> 00:31:25.590
use it in a non,
a near field communication with

579
00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:28.080
their phone, just tap their
phone to the device. Absolutely.

580
00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:30.630
And then it says, Oh,
it's this guy again. And

581
00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:32.850
it goes, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah. And it changes

582
00:31:33.390 --> 00:31:36.060
Exactly. The architects tries to
be as flexible as possible.

583
00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:39.120
So there's a concept of
a user listener, which is

584
00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:41.190
sort of a plugin approach.
If you like that sort

585
00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:43.260
of idea, there are various
listeners which will give you

586
00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:47.790
different ways. Of course, there's,
there's now biometric identification as

587
00:31:47.790 --> 00:31:49.800
well, coming along. That would
be a good one. But

588
00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:51.510
the main thing I guess,
is to avoid the, the

589
00:31:51.510 --> 00:31:54.390
horrors of having to log
in. You know, this is

590
00:31:54.390 --> 00:31:57.120
an accessibility nightmare in itself.
One of the things that

591
00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:59.640
happened to me when I
started getting into accessibility for

592
00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:03.360
banking applications, is I, in
my mind, this was before

593
00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:07.170
the word gamification became a
thing. I I'm a bit

594
00:32:07.170 --> 00:32:09.780
of a completist when I
play games, you know, I

595
00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:12.240
want to get all the
little, you know, all the

596
00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:14.700
open, all the little chests
and visits. Yeah. I never

597
00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:17.220
got anywhere with Lego star
Wars. Cause I just tried

598
00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:19.350
to do everything I could
see. Exactly. Well, the same

599
00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:21.060
thing happens. I think when
the, when people who are

600
00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:24.210
listening start getting into Aria,
they're going to say, Oh

601
00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:26.130
gosh, well, is that the
right tag for this? And

602
00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:28.170
then I properly Mark that
up and you're going to

603
00:32:28.170 --> 00:32:31.080
become a completist as well.
And you're going to want

604
00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:33.540
to make sure that all
aspects of your website are

605
00:32:33.570 --> 00:32:36.540
really accessible to everybody. And
I think that that's hopefully

606
00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:38.790
that's what will happen. We'll
gamify gamify this in some

607
00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:44.020
way for, for properly marking
up their pages. Yeah. When

608
00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:46.560
Mozilla had these open badges,
don't they? So you could

609
00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:49.000
create that. That'd be to
the idea is that you

610
00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.330
can create these little tokens
that people can gain. Anyone

611
00:32:52.330 --> 00:32:54.130
can gray once or maybe
Emma, it's a good idea.

612
00:32:54.130 --> 00:32:58.360
We should create one for
various stages of website accessibility.

613
00:32:58.450 --> 00:33:01.810
Absolutely. But the point is
there's a very valid point

614
00:33:01.810 --> 00:33:04.090
to make there. If you're
not a completist and you're

615
00:33:04.090 --> 00:33:07.960
daunted by it, don't worry.
Just any little bit helps.

616
00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:11.050
Yeah. Is that true? Really?
I mean, it's not something

617
00:33:11.050 --> 00:33:14.020
that you have to just,
you know, descend on mass

618
00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:17.140
onto your application and plug
in, you can pick, you

619
00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:19.300
know, pick a particular hotspot
and try to make it

620
00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:21.520
more accessible and, and sprinkle
it here and there and

621
00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:23.770
try to make, you know,
work from the inside out.

622
00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:26.200
Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I
guess you have to be

623
00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:30.220
pragmatic if you got a
big legacy code base, the,

624
00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:32.530
the best way of doing
accessibility is easily embedded in

625
00:33:32.530 --> 00:33:36.270
your workflows from the beginning.
Absolutely. Cause otherwise it's like

626
00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:39.910
testing. If you leave, if
you leave it to the

627
00:33:39.910 --> 00:33:42.010
end and the costs are
bigger when you, then if

628
00:33:42.010 --> 00:33:44.260
you do the testing while
you're going through the development,

629
00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:49.570
same of accessibility, but any
little, any improvement could, you

630
00:33:49.570 --> 00:33:52.330
know, can make people happy.
I mean, the people are

631
00:33:52.330 --> 00:33:54.850
still going to, if somebody
really upsets them, they're going

632
00:33:54.850 --> 00:33:56.770
to vote with their mouse
and go somewhere else. But,

633
00:33:57.610 --> 00:33:59.830
Okay. So that means that
when the, when you're initially,

634
00:33:59.830 --> 00:34:03.550
if you have a green
Greenfield project, that's a great

635
00:34:03.550 --> 00:34:06.040
time to start making your
taxonomy of here. All the

636
00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:10.780
controls here are their Aria
counterparts. They're already at annotations

637
00:34:10.810 --> 00:34:14.110
and let's ensure and write
in our tests that that's

638
00:34:14.110 --> 00:34:18.640
being done. Absolutely. Yes, definitely.
And also structures. The other

639
00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:22.660
really important one Structure is
important because you're saying, don't

640
00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:25.750
just say everything's a div
like H one H two,

641
00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:30.490
this stuff matters. Yeah. And
it's also also the higher

642
00:34:30.490 --> 00:34:33.160
level of that. Your content
structure, you know, you use

643
00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:37.690
say this is a heading
and the stuff applies, not

644
00:34:37.690 --> 00:34:40.690
just to this applies to
documents. If you're creating a

645
00:34:40.690 --> 00:34:43.720
word, I'm sorry, a word
processor document. I won't mention

646
00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:47.440
a particular technology. You can
very easily just change all

647
00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:49.420
the styles as you're going
through it. And so wherever

648
00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:50.980
you got to head in,
you save it's bold and

649
00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:53.530
it's a bigger font and
that you are different font,

650
00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:57.600
but if you styles and
apply them to each heading

651
00:34:57.610 --> 00:34:59.140
one, it's easy for you.
If you want to change

652
00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:02.320
something as a content author,
but two, it allows the

653
00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:06.280
assisted technology to pick up
what's a heading. So there's

654
00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:09.370
techniques like that, which you
really want to embed right

655
00:35:09.370 --> 00:35:13.270
at the beginning. Cause yeah,
it'd be do it. There's

656
00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:16.330
this AWD later. And it's
just so much Probably fair

657
00:35:16.330 --> 00:35:19.300
to say that if you're
doing well-structured HTML five, you're

658
00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:22.000
doing well-structured CSS, then you're
in a good position to

659
00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.140
start getting right into Aria
immediately. Yeah. If you're, if

660
00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:29.980
you're somebody and I hope
you are, who is concerned

661
00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:34.780
about the structure and, and
using the standards correctly, I

662
00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:38.850
writing good semantic as it
gets called, which is, does

663
00:35:38.850 --> 00:35:43.260
a buzzword for good structure.
Really? Then you're going to

664
00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:46.560
find you've you've, you're just
adding a few more extra

665
00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:49.490
bits into what you're doing
anyway. So, So we're going

666
00:35:49.490 --> 00:35:51.410
to get a whole pile
of links from you. And

667
00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:52.850
we're going to put those
in the show notes to

668
00:35:52.850 --> 00:35:54.410
make sure that people can
go out there and learn

669
00:35:54.410 --> 00:35:57.380
about accessibility as well as
when they go out there

670
00:35:57.380 --> 00:35:59.960
and Google or Google with
bang, they can go and

671
00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:03.350
search for not just the
word accessibility, but also a,

672
00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:07.850
the number 11. And then
Y that's the abbreviation for

673
00:36:07.850 --> 00:36:11.030
accessibility. Isn't it? It absolutely
is. And if you want

674
00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:13.430
to know why it's totally
geeky reason, it's because people

675
00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:15.680
are lazy typers and there's
11 letters in the word

676
00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:18.830
accessibility. So it's a 11
letter as well, same with

677
00:36:18.830 --> 00:36:23.930
internationalization. And it's a fantastic
hashtag it's worth mentioning that

678
00:36:23.930 --> 00:36:26.930
there's a great community of
passionate, helpful people out there.

679
00:36:27.230 --> 00:36:31.550
And if you're on Twitter,
use hashtag Allie for searches,

680
00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:34.100
you'll soon find out who
are the movers and shakers

681
00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:36.530
and the people who can,
who can help you and

682
00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:38.780
what the tools are. And
it's a great way of

683
00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:41.090
finding out more Well and
you are one of them

684
00:36:41.090 --> 00:36:44.450
and we appreciate you very
much. Thank you. All right.

685
00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:47.210
This has been another episode
of Hansel minutes and we'll

686
00:36:47.210 --> 00:36:48.470
see you again next week.
