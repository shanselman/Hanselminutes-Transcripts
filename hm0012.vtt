11
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.240
In this episode, Scott covers
the top 10 coolest windows

12
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:11.870
utilities. You don't know, you
already have Carl Franklin and you're

13
00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.660
listening to Hansel minutes. I'm
here with Scott as always,

14
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.390
but this time I'm recording
from my hotel room in

15
00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.430
Orlando, Florida, just as the
fireworks start at Epcot, right?

16
00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.650
Five miles away from here.
What do you think about

17
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.490
that? Scott? Fantastic. So what
are we talking about today?

18
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.440
Well, this is the top
10 little known windows utilities

19
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.040
slash features that you may
already have in the tradition

20
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.570
of having really long top
10 list names. Alright, full-stop

21
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.450
decided to be great. So
we're going to go in

22
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.310
increasing order to the ones
that this is actually, I'm

23
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.500
not an arbitrary order. I'm
putting the ones I think

24
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.760
are cooler towards the end.
So that way you're on

25
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.440
the hook to stay around
and find out what's going

26
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.220
on. Okay, great. Obvious and
simple. First one is, or

27
00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:04.220
number 10 rather is dragging
while all tabbing or dragging

28
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.990
to the task bar. A
lot of people don't realize

29
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.400
that when you start a
drag, you pick up a

30
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.250
file or you pick up
a folder. You can drag

31
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.950
with one hand. So you've
picked up. I'm dragging right

32
00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.440
now. I'm not letting go
of my left mouse button.

33
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.750
I can actually all tab
so I can pick a

34
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.890
file up off my desktop,
all tab, go over to

35
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.860
outlook over to an email,
go over to word and

36
00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.190
then drop the file directly
on the drop spot. Very

37
00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.410
cool. Seems like a simple
thing, but I watch a

38
00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.080
lot of people moving their
windows around, trying to get

39
00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.990
things prepared to drag. That's
right. You've already got all

40
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.910
this stuff and your task
list. You can just, you

41
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.460
can just all tab and
drag. And then I know

42
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.980
that if you have a
window in the foreground and

43
00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.660
you drag a file from
a window, that's in the

44
00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.630
background, it will stay in
the background so you can

45
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.120
drag it onto it. Yup.
Yup. You can also know

46
00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.130
you could also, I didn't
know. You could all tab

47
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.830
and you can also drag
down to the task bar.

48
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.620
Don't drop. Cause you can
make you can't drop things

49
00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.700
in the task bar, drag
to the task hold. And

50
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.800
then as you hover over
the thing on the task

51
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.750
bar, it will jump to
the front. Then you can

52
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.240
go back up and drop
directly onto it. Wow. I

53
00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.510
use that all the time.
I didn't know that I

54
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.260
did not know that that
is some wacky wacky wild

55
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.880
stuff. I understand you can
drag the task bar. Yeah,

56
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.170
very cool stuff. Number 10.
Cool. Hey number nine is

57
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.480
a little perplexing and actually
number nine was an unlist.

58
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.620
And then I was at
a Mike under Lloyd's site

59
00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.510
at <inaudible> dot com. Very
cool site. And he had

60
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.640
a link to someone called
I color folder. This is

61
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.920
a folder coloring tool at
shrinks.com/dpf. It's a whole utility

62
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.020
dedicated to the ability to
change your folders icons. Wow.

63
00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.110
Pause for effect. But this
is already built into the

64
00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.990
shell. You can right click
on any folder. You like

65
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.750
any folder, right? Clicking on
a folder on my desktop

66
00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.480
right now, hit properties, click
on the fifth tab that

67
00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.350
says customize. And there's a
section that says folder icons,

68
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.500
you can change your folders.
Now I do this. Now

69
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.870
a lot of people see
my really colorful desktop. I

70
00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.050
like to have different folders
or different colors. That mean

71
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.450
different things. Cause if you've
just got a whole desktop

72
00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.170
full of Manila, colored folders,
yellow colored folders, it doesn't

73
00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:21.040
really tell you anything. There's
like 32 times 32 pixels,

74
00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.370
completely wasted that could be
giving you some information. So

75
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.470
I'm not quite sure. And
then I realized when I

76
00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.080
read the FAQ about this
particular utility, it said, and

77
00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.060
we don't stay resident in
memory. We have a very

78
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.670
low footprint and I realized,
well, they're just writing to

79
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.610
the same file that windows
shell writes. Do the desktop

80
00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.610
dot any file. When you
make a change like this,

81
00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.120
there's a hidden file called
desktop dot any that refers

82
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.450
to the icon of your
particular folder. So this may

83
00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.690
be a shiny utility and
wonderful. I don't use it

84
00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.810
because it's built into Explorer.
So folder coloring is a

85
00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.930
really great way to get
a productivity gain. And actually

86
00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.510
I'll probably blog about this
and put up a bunch

87
00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.420
of my colored folder icon
so people can, can jump

88
00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.910
on the colored folder wagon
that the Mac users have

89
00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.550
been holding over us for
the last several years. Excellent.

90
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:13.810
Cool. Number eight. You remember
subst? Sub S T. Yeah.

91
00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:18.150
What is that? Subs is
substitute like substitute drive. That's

92
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.430
right. That was the dusk
man, right? Yeah. It's a

93
00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.910
dos command. That's still around.
Yeah. And subs lets you

94
00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:26.520
say, I want to make
this path a drive. So

95
00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.470
you could like say subst
T colon space Seabeck slash

96
00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.900
temp and then suddenly the
T drive would become your

97
00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.350
temp drive. It's all coming
back to me. Ah, yes.

98
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:41.340
I put our happened to
sepsis. No, no, no. The

99
00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.500
thing about subs that's cool
is that if you bring

100
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.530
up an Explorer window and
you've got the.net framework on

101
00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:50.520
your machine, if you go
to see backslash windows backslash

102
00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:55.170
assembly, you're going to see
the gack right. You'll see

103
00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:57.740
the global assembly cache. And
what you're going to see

104
00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.250
though is a lie. Okay?
That's not really a director.

105
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:03.920
If you look at your
columns, you're seeing a lie

106
00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:07.220
there. You're seeing assembly name,
version, public key token. So

107
00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.040
shell extension, it's a shell
extension. Exactly. But if you

108
00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.200
go out to your command
line and you type say

109
00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:19.310
subst, G colon C colon
backslash windows, backslash assembly, and

110
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:22.190
then instead of visiting, see
windows assembly, visit the G

111
00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:25.520
drive that the newly created
G drive, you will see

112
00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.880
what's really in the GAC,
the underneath of the GAC.

113
00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:31.580
They won't know enough to
give you the lie. Very

114
00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:33.920
cool. So what's cool about
this is that sometimes you

115
00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:37.340
need to debug stuff. That's
in the GAC. You've already

116
00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.530
added to the GAC, but
you're doing some development. So

117
00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:42.020
you need to add your
PDBs, right? Your program, debug

118
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:44.900
files. And they have to
be in the GAC along

119
00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.960
with the actual files so
you can debug them. So

120
00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.110
if you subs a drive
to the GAC, you can

121
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:53.780
then sneak in there, see
the real directory structure, find

122
00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:56.390
your files, put your PDBs
next to them. And you

123
00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:58.910
can debug items that are
already in the GAC. Very,

124
00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:01.610
very cool. Shiny is a
great use of that technology.

125
00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:04.700
Totally. Generally, I don't like
subs. I know a lot

126
00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:06.560
of people use it for
their build drives. They're like

127
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:08.810
everyone has to build on
the Z drive and then

128
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:12.170
one guy might have see
dev Fu and the other.

129
00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:15.290
Guy's got C projects Fu
and they all subs their

130
00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:17.660
drives to it. As a
way of finding common ground.

131
00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:21.530
Instead of using subs, I
like to use junction points

132
00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:25.190
or what's also called link
D junction points or something

133
00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:26.960
that you already have built
in. This is something that

134
00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.530
NTFS always supported except there
was never a utility to

135
00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:34.190
get to it. The, the
windows NT four resource kit

136
00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:37.100
and the windows 2000 resource
kit included a command line

137
00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.890
utility called link D. But
the best one is a

138
00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:42.860
thing called junction that you
can get from sysinternals. Everyone

139
00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:46.820
loves sysinternals and then awhile
back, my buddy, Travis, Illig

140
00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:50.510
made a, an icon that
would show up in Explorer

141
00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:53.540
so that these junction points,
these folders, that point to

142
00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:56.350
other folders would have a
little chain indicating that there

143
00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:59.480
a junction, but he talked
to a guy named Herrmann

144
00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:04.040
Schlegel Schnoodle S C H
I N a G L

145
00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:06.440
as a I'm a good
German with a nag last

146
00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:08.090
name Hanselman, but I don't
know how to pronounce this

147
00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:12.590
gentleman's name. I'm not sure
Herman created a great thing

148
00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:19.190
at shrinks.com/dpg and actually incorporated
Travis's suggestions and created what

149
00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:22.940
he calls the hard link
shell extension. This is a

150
00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:26.330
utility that lets you actually
write drag from one folder

151
00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:29.180
to another. And then when
you write drag and let

152
00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:31.490
go, he'll pop up an
option to say, make a

153
00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:34.850
junction here. So this allows
you to write your build

154
00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:37.430
files, your batch files, your
Emma's builds all your different

155
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:41.690
builds, relative paths. So like
for example, we've got an

156
00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:44.960
SDK that we use and
everyone's got it installed somewhere

157
00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.660
different, right? So with our
builds, I like to make

158
00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:51.200
a folder called SDK and
then the person who's doing

159
00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.420
the bill, no matter where
they've got the SDK installed,

160
00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:56.430
they just make a pointer
to it, a junction to

161
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:58.890
it. This is something that's
built into the file system.

162
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:03.090
Very cool. Yeah, it is.
Which actually brings me smoothly

163
00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:06.980
into number six Before we
get there, before we get

164
00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:08.810
there, I w I want
to ask you, you've done

165
00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:12.380
some shelf extension programming yourself,
right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I

166
00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:14.630
was, I was just thinking
that might make a really

167
00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:18.620
good a DNR TV. It
would, you know, shell extensions

168
00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:21.200
are really powerful, but there's
one thing that I think

169
00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.470
Microsoft and that everyone is
really punting on right now

170
00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:27.140
is that you can only
have one version of the.net

171
00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:31.040
framework loaded into a process
at a time. So what

172
00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:33.500
happens if I write a
shell extension and.net one and

173
00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:35.180
you write it and Dutton
at two, and we try

174
00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:38.360
to live together nine times
out of 10, it works

175
00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:41.780
just fine. But every once
in a while, probably my

176
00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:44.170
shell extension, the one Ochella
extension of the one, one,

177
00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:49.340
one won't work if two
O gets in first. So

178
00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.290
there's some really cool stuff
going on right now about

179
00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:53.960
shell extensions as a company
that made a, a shell

180
00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:58.460
extension maker that literally made
it integrated individual studio release,

181
00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:01.460
go file new shell extension.
But I think that people

182
00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:03.920
are kind of missing the
point that there's three versions

183
00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:05.900
of the.net framework out there.
And you really just don't

184
00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:09.620
know which one's going to
get in memory At 1.1,

185
00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:12.410
you're probably pretty safe, right?
For the most part, as

186
00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:16.130
long as your shell extension
doesn't do any remoting outside.

187
00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.340
I've worked with Michelle extension
from logic tech that did

188
00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:23.240
some remoting and there's there's
problems remoting between one, one

189
00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.760
and two. Oh, you'll get
this really obscure error that

190
00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:29.630
says date time, men ticks
something. Something is not compatible.

191
00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:32.540
It's kind of like the
classic sort of loading error.

192
00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:35.930
That's showing that there's a
compatibility problem, but yeah, for

193
00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:37.490
the most part it'll work.
But I just wanted to

194
00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:40.400
warn people that when you're
making any kind of extension,

195
00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:43.820
whether it be inside of
like MMC or it's explore,

196
00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:47.000
if you don't own the
executable, then you can't count

197
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.520
on the right version of
the dotnet frame. Let's just

198
00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.410
get right Aside for another
day. And we could do

199
00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:54.740
a DNR TV on shell
extensions. Would ya? Totally cool.

200
00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:59.930
Totally. So the fact that
Hermanns Michelle extension uses right,

201
00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:03.230
dragging that means dragging with
the right mouse button and

202
00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:06.050
then letting go, it gets
me into a cool little

203
00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:09.740
known feature, number six, which
is right dragging there's so

204
00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:13.190
many places where you can
drag something and drop with

205
00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:16.670
a right mouse button and
get a different feature. I

206
00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:18.680
mean, the obvious one is,
of course it's explore. If

207
00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:21.620
you pick anything up and
explore and right drag it

208
00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:24.830
you'll get move, copy, create
shortcut. But a lot of

209
00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:27.770
people don't realize that this
works in outlook and word.

210
00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:29.690
You can like go into
word type a bunch of

211
00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:34.310
words, select one, and then
write drag it. And you'll

212
00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:38.030
actually get a context menu
about moving, copying, or linking

213
00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:41.210
to that word. Wow. A
lot easier than the whole

214
00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:44.810
cut copy paste, paste, special
thing, and a really right

215
00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:47.360
clicking and right. Dragging will
set you free no matter

216
00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.570
what you're doing. That's cool.
You don't really think of

217
00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:53.470
that much. I know for
new you new windows, it

218
00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:55.030
takes them a long Time
to get conditioned to the

219
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:57.940
right mouse button, you know,
get used to it because

220
00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:01.020
it's not discovered I'm talking
mere mortals here. Yeah. But

221
00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:02.640
it's, I mean, it's not,
it's, it's reasonable though, because

222
00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:05.250
it's not discoverable. Right. Why
was the start menu added

223
00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:08.730
to windows 95? It's because
our monkey will never double

224
00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:12.120
click. Right? If you go
into like pro you know,

225
00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:15.120
program manager and windows three,
one, it's just, there's not

226
00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.700
discoverable. Oh, DoubleClick. Oh, that's
so obvious. Triple click. You

227
00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:19.840
know, it's not obvious. Like
if you go into word

228
00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:23.910
right. DoubleClick, we'll select a
word. Right. You know that

229
00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:26.130
you can go and double
click, get a word. If

230
00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:29.590
you triple click in Microsoft
word, what happens? Select the

231
00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:33.180
whole paragraph, right? Yeah. Yeah.
Totally discoverable. Right. Completely obvious.

232
00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:37.200
But quadruple, he doesn't do
anything. So these kinds of

233
00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:39.600
UI things are not particularly
discoverable, but once you do

234
00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.510
find them, it's very hard.
Yep. So the next one

235
00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:46.650
is number five windows hotkeys.
And I mean specifically hotkeys

236
00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:52.020
that use the windows key.
Yeah. Jeff Atwood windows. He

237
00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:56.070
brings up Explorer. For example,
exactly. Jeff Atwood actually listed

238
00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:59.430
them all out at shrinks.com/d
P H at his very,

239
00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:03.430
very good coding horror site.
And he's got a list

240
00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:09.120
bar coding. R H O
R R O R. Okay.

241
00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:13.290
Just checking. Yeah. Shrinks your.com.
Not coding whore. Thank you

242
00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:15.540
for taking it there. Okay.
What's she going to say

243
00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:19.440
that I just, I took
it there, then got shrinks.

244
00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:23.820
your.com/dph. Jeff. That was a
fantastic writer. And his, his,

245
00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:25.980
his site is a gym.
I read it every day

246
00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:28.620
and he's got a whole
list of them up there.

247
00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:31.680
And he points out that
where those keys and like

248
00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:35.340
window E for Explorer and
window M for minimize when

249
00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:40.320
key, which is a utility
that is specializes in making

250
00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:44.580
the windows key, bind, double
to other things, right. Is

251
00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:46.980
a great thing. It turns
out that the company that

252
00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:50.610
makes Winky is no longer
distributing it, but I found

253
00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:55.740
a download@shrinks.com slash DPI. So
grab yourself a copy of

254
00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:58.560
wind key and know that
it's no longer supported, but

255
00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:01.410
it's rock and sweet and
a squirrel it away. Because

256
00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:02.730
one day you won't be
able to find a copy

257
00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:05.070
anywhere online. It turns out
the company found it too

258
00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:07.740
much of a support burden.
So they decided to move

259
00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:12.270
on to other things. Wow.
Great tip. Yeah. Okay. Number

260
00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:17.550
four is command lines other
than command. Right now, we

261
00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:22.890
talked about monad in our
last, so monads an obvious

262
00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:26.910
example, but it turns out
there are other shells command

263
00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:31.710
line utilities within windows that
exist already. The first one

264
00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:34.290
is a thing called w
M I C. So if

265
00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:35.760
you go out to the
command line, you got to

266
00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:40.170
CMD dot exe and you
type in WMI C you'll

267
00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:44.820
get a windows management instrumentation
shell. This is a shell

268
00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:48.390
that just does WMI. Cool.
So you can go out

269
00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:50.730
there and type queries and
things that you would be

270
00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:53.450
ordinarily to write a WMI
program to do. Like you

271
00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:58.460
could say, process where description
equals explored at exe. And

272
00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:00.350
you can get information about
the Explorer that he actually

273
00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:05.000
process. You can poke around
all throughout the WMI namespaces

274
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.670
and see all the information
that's there. It lets you

275
00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:11.120
browse schemas query all the
different classes you can work

276
00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:14.930
with. Remote computers, make aliases,
you can write specific scripts

277
00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:19.850
for a, an administrator of
a large network. It's just

278
00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:22.070
one more thing. One more
quick, you know, arrow in

279
00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:24.830
your quiver. That, and I
was totally surprised. It's like,

280
00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:27.080
whenever you type something at
the command line and you

281
00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:30.770
see a result that you've
never seen before, and you

282
00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:33.350
didn't realize it was installed
that all the while. It's

283
00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:37.250
pretty cool. It's like discovering,
you know, discovering gold. Absolutely.

284
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:43.910
That's w mic that's a
trickster.com/dpj. Okay. I had never

285
00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:46.300
seen that one before today.
Did you? No, I never

286
00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:50.800
heard of it. A net
net. S H this is

287
00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:52.570
a good one. I'd actually
use this one, but not

288
00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:54.910
to the depths of what
it can do. Net S

289
00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:59.590
H a shrinker.com/dpk. This is
a tool that lets you

290
00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:01.870
do all the kinds of
things you would do from

291
00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:06.880
the network interface properties window
from the command line. So

292
00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:09.220
you can go type net
sh you could say add

293
00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:13.450
server and then add a
DHCP server. You can go

294
00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:17.020
if you want it to
like uninstalling IPV six, sometimes

295
00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:20.590
that can screw up people's
machines. I've got information up@shrinksor.com

296
00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:25.570
slash DPL. You can type
net sh interface, IPV six

297
00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:28.330
uninstalled. But the most useful
thing I found that you

298
00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:30.310
can do with Nettis H
is I actually got my

299
00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:33.400
system into such a boogered
up way that when I

300
00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:36.700
ran IP config from the
command line, it did nothing.

301
00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:39.910
Hey, here's a nice little
tip for you with IP

302
00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:44.470
config is that, you know,
sometimes you'll have a bad

303
00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:49.000
DNS entry because you're working
on sites and editing DNS

304
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.570
entries, and you go in
there, something gets in there,

305
00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:53.530
that's wrong. You go and
change it. And the DNS

306
00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:57.310
server, and it doesn't change
in your, on your client

307
00:16:57.310 --> 00:16:59.860
because of the time to
live and all that stuff.

308
00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:04.600
So there's a local DNS
cache associated with your connection.

309
00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:09.670
If you type IP config
slash flush DNS, it'll remove

310
00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:11.980
it from the cash. That's
kind of the control F

311
00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:16.390
five equivalent site bus through
that. Don't trust me. I

312
00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:20.230
want fresh DNS. Absolutely. Right?
Absolutely. And I'd like to

313
00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:22.960
remind everybody that Hansel minutes
is made possible this week

314
00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:27.100
by exceeds zip for.net, which
lets you handle zip tar

315
00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:31.030
and G zip files on
FTP servers in streams, in

316
00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:45.220
memory and more online@shrinksor.com slash
D T two Net sh

317
00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:49.260
will let you reset your
entire stack. So you can

318
00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:54.990
say net sh interface, IP
reset. And this has saved

319
00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:56.550
me two or three different
times when I got my

320
00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:59.880
system into all sorts of
weird States by basically rebuilding

321
00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:02.990
my whole little IP stack
under windows XP. I could

322
00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:05.960
have used that tonight. My
connections weren't working at all

323
00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:08.330
and rather than having to
log off and log back

324
00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:10.580
on and that kind of
stuff. Yeah, totally. And you

325
00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:14.540
can read Scott's post about
that. It shrinks for.com/d T

326
00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:18.470
one. So what's next. Moving
on, we're getting into the

327
00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:22.850
top three here from the
command line. Are you familiar

328
00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:27.140
with push D and pop
D no. So go out

329
00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:30.110
to the command line and
just what directory do you

330
00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:34.940
drop into? Probably documented settings
and settings. Yeah. Okay. So

331
00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:39.350
go and say like push
D all one word space

332
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:42.740
and then a period and
then CD off into like

333
00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:46.700
the windows directory, right. CD
slash windows. Okay. So then

334
00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:48.410
you're kind of off doing
some stuff and then you

335
00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:51.050
go and say, pop D
just pop D and then

336
00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:55.610
hit enter. Cool. There's actually
a stack of directories where

337
00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:57.560
you've been. So you know
how a lot of people

338
00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:59.810
write batch files that keep
track of where they are

339
00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:02.960
and you have to go
CD dot, dot cd.dot slash.dot.

340
00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:05.570
And you do all this
dancing with pushy and pop

341
00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:07.520
D sometimes you just want
to go back to where

342
00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:10.940
you were. Great. Now the
cool tip on top of

343
00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:15.200
that is setting your command
prompt differently. And Craig and

344
00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:16.880
Dara turned me on to
this and I've got this

345
00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:22.250
up at shrinker.com/dpn. You know
how people used to customize

346
00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:25.160
their command prompts and the
dos days and still do

347
00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:31.280
it. Now, if you say
set prompt equals slash P

348
00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:35.300
slash P excuse me, set
prompt equals dollar sign P

349
00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:39.860
where P is path a
dollar sign underscore were underscored

350
00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:44.900
means new line dollar sign
plus sign. Plus sign is

351
00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:46.490
going to tell you the
depth you are within the

352
00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:50.030
stack and then dollar sign
G again, all of this

353
00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:54.920
up at shrinks.com/dpn. You type
this prompt. You'll actually get

354
00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:58.250
a plus sign right before
the greater than that. You're

355
00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:00.050
used to seeing that we'll
show you how deep in

356
00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:03.110
the push D stack you
are. No kidding. So then

357
00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:05.210
you can see push D
you'll see a plus push

358
00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:08.270
the, again, you'll see a
second. Plus, this lets you

359
00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:11.660
write very robust batch files
where you can get right

360
00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:13.370
back to where you were
before and not have any

361
00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:16.340
trouble because you CD dot
dotted one too many times.

362
00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:19.820
Dude. That is sweet. Yeah.
So big. Thanks to Craig

363
00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:24.320
Adair for that tip shrinking.com/dp.
That's awesome. I'm going to

364
00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:27.440
use that tomorrow. RFC. This
is, this is, this is

365
00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:29.540
what the minutes is for
man. I'm going to use

366
00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:31.820
that tomorrow. If I can
help, if I can change

367
00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:34.100
the life of just one
child here on the moon,

368
00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:39.140
Teach a man to fish.
Yeah, dude. Totally. And then

369
00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:41.810
within number three, cause we're
talking about moving around with

370
00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:43.940
directories and stuff, you know,
you just can't say enough

371
00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:47.860
nice things about tab completion,
right? Okay. So like we're

372
00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:49.660
down here at the command
prompt and we're doing push

373
00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:52.150
D and pop D and
one of the things that

374
00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:55.390
just cannot help you too
much is the tab completion

375
00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:58.750
stuff, right? We've all remembered
early versions of windows 2000

376
00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:00.640
where we'd go into the
registry and set the tab

377
00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:05.860
completion character ourselves, right? Patrick Caldwell
reminded me today that how

378
00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:09.700
many things the tab completion
can do for you. You

379
00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:12.100
give it just the slightest,
hint that what you want

380
00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:14.170
to do and you hit
tab and they'll help you

381
00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:17.770
out. You type CD, you
know, doc and you hit

382
00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:20.710
tab. It automatically puts in
SQL and backslash documents and

383
00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:24.100
settings all in quotes, correct
for you. And then of

384
00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:27.220
course, shift tab gets you
to the other options tab

385
00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:29.110
and shift at school. A
lot of people think it's

386
00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:32.800
just a simple step forward,
give you some auto-completion, but

387
00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:36.820
it's so much more also
the depth of wildcards that

388
00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:40.720
it'll take. You can say
star food star and you

389
00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:43.420
can find a directories or
files where Fu is in

390
00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:46.480
the middle. Ah, you know,
sometimes you don't have full

391
00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:49.690
wildcard support, but the stuff
at the command line is

392
00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:53.540
just very well enabled for
command lands, where anything DIR

393
00:21:53.610 --> 00:21:57.460
understands. It will understand. Cool.
So yeah, if, you know,

394
00:21:57.460 --> 00:21:59.890
if you, if you use
tab completion, but you don't

395
00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:02.680
think you really use it
to the fullest that alongside

396
00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:05.230
push D pop D and
a customized prompt can really

397
00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:09.040
make you a Ninja at
the command line. Absolutely cool.

398
00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:12.490
Number two, people may not
think this is an appropriate

399
00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:14.410
number two, but I think
it is cause I'm all

400
00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:18.010
about the big fonts, right?
Changing your console font, you

401
00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:20.470
know how you can bring
up a command line and

402
00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:22.360
you go and click in
the upper left hand corner

403
00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:24.850
there and say properties, you
get a choice. You get

404
00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:28.480
this really lame choice between
Lucetta console and then some

405
00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:33.430
bitmap fonts from 1985, you
can control what goes in

406
00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:36.940
that font window. If you've
got another Manoa type font

407
00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:39.640
that you really like, maybe
the font that you use

408
00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:43.930
for programming with you can
modify the registry and get

409
00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:46.870
your own fonts in there.
And I've got details at

410
00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:52.330
<inaudible> dot com slash DPO
and George Riley actually expanded on

411
00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:54.220
that and made a registry
key that makes it even

412
00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:58.240
easier registry a registry file
that you can run at

413
00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:02.920
trickster.com/dpp. So a lot of
people have been stealing like

414
00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:06.190
the consolers font from the
Longhorn disks or from office

415
00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:09.130
12 there's if you search
for program or font on

416
00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:12.100
Google, there's a million different
monospace fonts. You know, you're

417
00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:15.730
not relegated just to Curry,
you're new. So I would

418
00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:18.670
encourage people to check out
in, you know, customizing their

419
00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:21.160
environment. I like to make
my font. I use console

420
00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:24.670
us. I go black background
on a green screen. I

421
00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:27.550
use a 24 point font
because I want those dots

422
00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:32.340
to work for me, man,
high DPI, shiny, very And

423
00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:35.250
the number one, cool utility
and or cool thing about

424
00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:40.050
windows this week. Who's all
the million other command line

425
00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:43.470
utilities that you already have,
but don't know about, wow.

426
00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:46.070
I was writing up a
list of these myself and

427
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:48.740
I went up to a
Google to check on one

428
00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:53.630
of them and discovered shrink,
stir.com/dpq, which is a list

429
00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:56.390
of all the crazy utilities
you've never heard of that

430
00:23:56.600 --> 00:24:01.130
exists already on your system,
including ones that aren't documented.

431
00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:04.210
Now, these aren't things that
you have to download. These

432
00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:06.910
are awesome Already on your
system. You have these now.

433
00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:08.020
So why don't you go
out to a command line?

434
00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:10.510
We'll do them together here.
Excellent. So the first one

435
00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:15.790
is FSU tail file system
util all sorts of things

436
00:24:15.790 --> 00:24:21.580
about managing the volumes, managing
your disks file specific commands

437
00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:25.360
file system information. And these
are, these are guaranteed to

438
00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:31.450
exist on what On windows
XP in 2003. Okay. Yeah.

439
00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:33.040
So like for example, I
mean it might be something

440
00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:38.200
as simple as FSU till
space Fs InfoSpace drives gives

441
00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:41.200
you a list of all
of your current drives. That's

442
00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:44.320
pretty simple, but there's lots
of different other things like

443
00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:48.880
FSU, tail Fs info, volume
info, you get details about

444
00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:52.360
all of your different drives,
whether or not they support

445
00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:54.880
case sensitivity, whether or not
support Unicode in their file

446
00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:57.880
names, whether or not they
support Ackles, whether they support

447
00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:01.720
compression, it's a capability querier
of your file system, FSU

448
00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:03.970
tail. These are all things
you could put into your

449
00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:07.810
batch files and your various
utilities. Cause you can count

450
00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:10.780
on these being there all
the time. So here's another

451
00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:12.400
crazy one. If you go
to your command line and

452
00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:17.680
you type you DC edit,
this is a thing called

453
00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:21.610
the private character editor, EDU
D C edit the sexy,

454
00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:23.740
a weird, I had no
idea this was on my

455
00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:25.660
system. This is a utility
that you could actually build

456
00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:29.600
your own font from. It's
a private character editor. So

457
00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:32.530
I'm not really sure quite
why or why it's useful

458
00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:35.140
or interesting. There's lots of
other font building tools, but

459
00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:38.800
I always find it creepy
to know my machine completely

460
00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:42.160
and then discover an application
that I had no idea

461
00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:45.640
existed. And this one has
a full UI for editing

462
00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:50.920
fonts. It's crazy. Wow. Yeah,
totally. Some useful stuff that

463
00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:52.810
you can use on like
your mom's machine or a

464
00:25:52.810 --> 00:25:54.760
machine you come upon that
maybe boogered up is you

465
00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:58.030
can type S F C
it's the system file checker.

466
00:25:58.360 --> 00:25:59.920
This is the thing that
will go through all of

467
00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:05.800
your windows protected system files.
And it will basically overwrite

468
00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:09.400
and replace the quote unquote
incorrect versions with Microsoft versions.

469
00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:10.810
So if you think that
you've got a machine that's

470
00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:14.830
been compromised or has got
an, an invalid driver on

471
00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:19.570
it, or somehow has become
corrupted, SFC is a tool

472
00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:22.270
you can use to scan
your system either on boot

473
00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:25.390
or scan immediately and potentially
bring it back from the,

474
00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:28.390
from the brink. Wow. And
then within the context of

475
00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:31.870
drivers, if you type driver
query just one word driver

476
00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:34.240
query from the command line,
you'll get a complete list

477
00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:36.220
of all of the drivers
that are running on your

478
00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:39.040
system. And there's all sorts
of things. If you type

479
00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:42.340
driver query slash question Mark,
that lets you basically enumerate

480
00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:46.080
and list all the different
installed device drivers and their

481
00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:49.920
properties, and even out put
them as a, a CSB

482
00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:54.240
file. Couple of other quick
utilities, disk part is a

483
00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:57.690
disc partitioning tool. Another kind
of hidden command line that

484
00:26:57.690 --> 00:27:02.010
you can use very dangerous.
Don't hurt yourself. Yup. Yup.

485
00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:05.370
Open files. Apparently we'll let
you see all of the

486
00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:08.070
different files that are open
on your, on your shares

487
00:27:08.770 --> 00:27:12.270
and also enable your local
file tracking. So you can

488
00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:15.990
see all the open files
in your system currently. Awesome.

489
00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:20.790
Yep. S C service control
is like a net stop

490
00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:24.720
or net start on steroids.
It lets you manage services

491
00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:27.420
and control services from the
command line. And then the

492
00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:28.980
last one, which I thought
was kind of cool is

493
00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:33.150
get Mac G T Mac
lets you basically get the

494
00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:36.090
Mac addresses. You know, I
always do IP config slash

495
00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:38.220
all, but now get Mac
just does it and tells

496
00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:41.820
you the status of those
particular interfaces. Pretty cool stuff.

497
00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:44.610
That is sweet. That's our,
that's our number one thing,

498
00:27:44.610 --> 00:27:46.980
a million other command line
utilities that you already have.

499
00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:50.760
Very cool. Scott, anything else?
Yeah. So I wanted to

500
00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:53.400
give a shout out. I
saw a pretty interesting site

501
00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:56.340
that Jonathan Goodyear's company is
putting up called email and

502
00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:59.730
the number two face. So
it's email to face.com and

503
00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:01.290
this is a pretty clever
idea. I'm not sure how

504
00:28:01.290 --> 00:28:03.450
they're going to get everyone
in the entire universe to

505
00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:05.850
put their email addresses and
faces up there. But they're

506
00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:09.060
basically storing a mapping between
your email address and your

507
00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:11.460
face. So you can go
up there and you add

508
00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:13.620
a small icon of your
face, maybe the one you

509
00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:16.200
use for your instant messenger.
And I think that they

510
00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:18.450
could probably come up with
some cool and creative ways

511
00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:22.350
to integrate this with outlook
or different messaging tools. When

512
00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:24.240
you have an email address
and you just want to

513
00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:27.510
see that person's face, you
know how outlooks contacts form

514
00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:30.480
lets you put their face
in, right? It'd be pretty

515
00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:32.880
slick to have like a
web services interface or maybe

516
00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:35.700
like just a simple HTP
get where I could get

517
00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:38.880
someone's face from their email
address. So check out email

518
00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:42.140
to face A real security
risk because it's not so

519
00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:45.620
high resolution that it's any
sort of Yeah. It's not

520
00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:48.650
like it's not email to
headshot. Yeah. It's not email

521
00:28:48.650 --> 00:28:52.250
to high res retinal scan.
Exactly. Email, email to fingerprint.

522
00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:57.380
Although I've got that idea
patented right now, Patent pending

523
00:28:57.890 --> 00:28:59.990
Scott, this has been a
fabulous show. Thank you so

524
00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:03.560
much. Great stuff as always.
And it makes me wonder

525
00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:05.360
how many more of these
shows you got. I mean

526
00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:07.940
there's a finite number of
cool things in the world

527
00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:12.500
is there we'll have to
wait and see who hurts

528
00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:17.660
you Carl Franklin who hurts you?
I think I've got a

529
00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:20.480
few more in me. All
right. Until next week. This

530
00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:25.010
is Carl Franklin Scott Hanselman saying
thanks for listening and have

531
00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:25.490
a great week.
