their inside perspective on outsourcing
Scott Hanselman. And this is

11
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.280
another episode of Hansel minutes,
and I'm sitting here at

12
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.630
mix Oh eight, and we're
going to be talking about

13
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.460
outsourcing. I've got Venkat from
Chennai and Vinod from Delhi

14
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.540
and these gentlemen, both own
companies that do work overseas.

15
00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.350
And they're based in these
respective cities. And we were

16
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.280
talking in the hallway a
moment ago about outsourcing and

17
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.930
as someone who's an American,
I have a lot of

18
00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.480
interest in this because certainly
I want my country to

19
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.800
do well, but at the
same time I want the

20
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.860
world to do well. And
I thought it was interesting

21
00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.990
that I had read somewhere
that getting a condo in

22
00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.120
downtown Bangalore was about $250,000
and it's U S dollars.

23
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.200
And I could go and
buy a condo, maybe even

24
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.460
two condos in my hometown
for that much money. Why

25
00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.950
would I outsource if the
cost overseas is so much

26
00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.410
more now? Yeah, it's true.
The cost is increasingly India.

27
00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.290
That's one of the challenges.
Both of us ran small

28
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.380
outfits in India and the
biggest cost for us as

29
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.030
the rising salary cost. But
I think over the years

30
00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.540
as the industry is maturing,
what lapping is, it's the

31
00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.660
niche players who will survive.
So it is not for

32
00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.510
the cost reasons you outsource
to India, but you will

33
00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.230
outsource for the speciality, the
niche. And then at the

34
00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.780
other end of the spectrum,
you'll outsource for the scale.

35
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.050
The big Indian companies today
can give you these scales,

36
00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.350
which are not possible, which
are only possible probably by

37
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.890
the big names like Accentures
and the ABMS. So you

38
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.020
want scale. You want like
500 people to be put

39
00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.240
on a project, then you
will go to India to

40
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.200
outsource. So the game will
change from cost to niche

41
00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.360
speciality and to scale. Now
it seems, it seems to

42
00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.820
me though, and forgive me
if you find this to

43
00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.280
be a, I don't mean
to insult, but I find

44
00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.300
that Americans are, and I'm
making a broad statement here

45
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.240
sometimes more creative, but less
raw horsepower analytical than, than,

46
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.010
than people from overseas is
that as a result of

47
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.790
education, I know that America
values into independent thinking. And

48
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.120
you know, you're a unique
snowflake, maybe a little bit

49
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.990
more than the raw analytical
horsepower that other country's educational

50
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.060
systems. Yep. There's nothing of
course insulting about this because

51
00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.010
it's more a fact and
different cultures work differently. My

52
00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.590
observation purely is the amount
of risk taking and the

53
00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.710
encouragement, the society, the family
friends gives an America has

54
00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.610
lot more than in India.
I can talk about our

55
00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.080
personal experiences. When I started
my company, many people looked

56
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.700
at me, why are you
starting this? Why can't you

57
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.700
just go to a job?
And today jobs in India,

58
00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.920
we might be very handsome.
I had $50,000, $200,000 a

59
00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.950
year. Our jobs you can
easily get in India. It's

60
00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.440
not unheard of five years
before it would have been

61
00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.550
crazy. And last week I
was in my college where

62
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.090
I did my engineering and
the college principal was saying,

63
00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.820
one of the biggest problems
they are facing is like

64
00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.880
the third year, it's a
four year course. Third year,

65
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.340
the people are getting their
campus interviews done and they

66
00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.650
are getting a job. So
they are losing interest from

67
00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.080
the actual education because he
has actually got a job

68
00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.110
much before he finishes it.
So the principal says that

69
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.720
the third year he hasn't
even graduated is going to

70
00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.130
earn much more than me.
So that's the challenge. So

71
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.310
coming back to your question,
the way our education system

72
00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.570
has been structured traditionally is
been valuing on the actual

73
00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.680
memory and reciting it correctly.
That's the way I think,

74
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.590
slowly it's changing and kind
of taking the best of

75
00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.350
both worlds, taking that. And
the American way of education

76
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.590
is also slowly coming in
and more people. Now we

77
00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.440
see a lot of people
coming back from us back

78
00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.500
to India. They are bringing
in that creative thinking also.

79
00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.800
So no more, you're not
look crazy if you start

80
00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.950
a company in India anymore.
So things are changing, but

81
00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:08.340
traditionally it's been value is
given more for the art

82
00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:13.440
core memory and doing tightens
the <inaudible>, Dan creativity, Dan

83
00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.530
experimenting. Yeah. Yeah. In fact,
one of the things that

84
00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.050
I'd like to add on
to that is that yes,

85
00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.260
creativity is something that I
think we are a little

86
00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:26.580
behind America. We are great
implementers. So if, if Americans

87
00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.570
give us the creative idea,
I think Indians implement implemented

88
00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:34.560
very, very well, but out
of the box coming and

89
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.400
thinking and coming up with
ideas, not, not very good.

90
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.500
And I, as, as when
could very rightly put it,

91
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.530
I think a part of
it, a blame, or if

92
00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:45.660
you want to call it
is the education system. It's

93
00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.750
good in some ways, because
we are very good engineers.

94
00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:52.290
We are very good, you
know, implementers, but in terms

95
00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:54.360
of thinking out of the
box, that's not really stressed

96
00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.590
upon in our education system
when industrially certainly there Indians

97
00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:00.020
and People, you know, I'm
not saying that America has

98
00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.300
it all locked up when
it comes to creativity, but

99
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.290
it definitely seems like you're
not encouraged from an educational

100
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:08.270
perspective. I mean, I went
to the, I went to

101
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:12.170
a public school in the
U S and there was

102
00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:17.150
always this notion of a
few expressing yourself creatively. And

103
00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.040
I think in high school,
we only went up as

104
00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.680
far as precalculus. So when
we came out as an

105
00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.480
18 or 19 year old,
we had done just the

106
00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.330
basics of pre-calculus. Now there
are what are called AP

107
00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:31.850
courses or advanced placement where
kids that showed a, a

108
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.880
propensity towards math could have
potentially gone and started doing

109
00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.910
college courses in when they
were 18. So you could

110
00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:40.820
potentially come out of a
Fort, you know, of a

111
00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:44.600
four year high school degree
at, at 18 with some

112
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.480
understanding of calculus. And at
what level, or do you

113
00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.890
learn these things in an
Indian school system? I, our

114
00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:53.650
high schools, I think when
we come out of school,

115
00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:57.820
we we're experts in it
calculus. Otherwise we don't pass

116
00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:01.090
it of school, especially if
taking the science courses really.

117
00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:03.490
So if you've taken sciences
and even if you're doing

118
00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:06.700
something like biology, which has
probably very little to do

119
00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:09.550
with maths, you still do
a lot of calculus in

120
00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:12.460
that. So we have taken
computers. You, you better be

121
00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:15.940
a rocket scientist. So Now
is it still based on

122
00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:19.420
the old levels, a levels
system, like the British colonial

123
00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:21.850
system of education, or is
that changed? That option? Yeah,

124
00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:25.210
It's still there, but we
have our own central board

125
00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:27.820
of secondary education, a couple
of other boards as well,

126
00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:31.750
but this, this option is
still there. How do you

127
00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:36.130
gentlemen think that the, the
echoes of colonialism are affecting

128
00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:39.520
both the, the political structure
and kind of like, you

129
00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.530
know, the societal structure, but
also the, the way people

130
00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:43.870
feel about themselves. I mean,
has India come into its

131
00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:47.110
own and finally pushed the
shackles off? Well, the youth,

132
00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:50.410
I mean, you know, our
generation would probably be the

133
00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:55.330
last ones to have that
colonial. I don't know the

134
00:07:55.330 --> 00:08:00.100
throwback. Yeah. That's probably my
mindset because of our parents,

135
00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:02.440
because they have seen that
and, you know, pass that

136
00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.390
on. But since we haven't
seen it, we only have

137
00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:09.190
a second hand, you know,
second hand interaction with this

138
00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:12.010
colonial thing. So our kids
will probably not have that

139
00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:14.590
at all. The youth does
not have that at all

140
00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:19.120
these days. Yep. I think
that that is very little

141
00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:23.290
leftovers of the colonialism. It's
been like more than 60

142
00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:27.730
years now, but you still
find it. And the way

143
00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:31.480
the government functions and levy
the education system over our

144
00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:35.440
lists. But I think India's,
India's very good at adapting.

145
00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:39.460
Anything more than any in
any of the occupiers you've

146
00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:41.470
even if you see the
more girls who came down

147
00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:45.160
and started going to India,
they became more Indianized. So

148
00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.770
even if Baeza comes to
India, does he need East?

149
00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:52.540
So it's the people earlier
about 10, 15 years back

150
00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:55.950
when globalization came to India,
they were worried that globalization

151
00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:59.460
will take or will corrupt
India. But I think it's

152
00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:02.250
more the globalization that is
getting, if you want to

153
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:06.300
use corruption by India, it's
getting influenced. I would say

154
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:09.090
definitely, by the way, India,
you are celebrating the Valley

155
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.510
and having Curry in the
British parliament. That's how the

156
00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:18.150
influences is going. And I
think it's everything is India.

157
00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:20.790
Not only takes it up
and makes its own. So

158
00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:23.370
I think you, even, if
you say the garment parliament

159
00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:27.600
system is British, I think
the vein Spiderman system is

160
00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:31.320
like, excellent. So one of
the things I keep jokingly

161
00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:35.040
telling my friends or us
should be outsourcing its elections

162
00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:37.350
to India because we run
it for a billion people

163
00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:40.230
and we don't have a
problem of people not knowing.

164
00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:43.140
And these are illiterate people
like 40 to 50% of

165
00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:45.450
those wards Put a picture
of who's on the ballot

166
00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:50.270
symbol For each candidate, the
party that he represents that

167
00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:52.730
will be elephants. That will
be boxers. That will be

168
00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:55.460
kite pin X. See, we
would have two pieces of

169
00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:57.200
paper, one with a picture
of an elephant moment, picture

170
00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:01.730
of a donkey. Yes. Even
in bibs. So people correctly

171
00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:04.550
would, so you go to
an illiterate person and you

172
00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:06.680
say, Oh, you ordered four.
He says, exactly this the

173
00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:09.200
party I wanted to vote.
This is the symbol I

174
00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:12.620
ordered for them. And last,
I think last 10 or

175
00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:15.110
12 years, we are only
doing electronic voting. And in

176
00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:17.630
few hours we get the
results. And remember, we are

177
00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:20.780
talking about an election where
700 million people more than the

178
00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:27.680
U S population. Yeah. And
it's amazing. Hi, this is

179
00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:31.190
Carl Franklin, the producer of Hansel
minutes with a message from

180
00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:35.150
Tellerik. Do you know how
to build web 2.08 Jack's

181
00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:41.090
applications with web 1.0 components,
right? You just can't in

182
00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:43.550
order to have next generation
web apps, you need next

183
00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:47.210
generation components. And that's exactly
what our friends at Tellerik

184
00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:50.630
have for you. Their upcoming
product code name, rad controls

185
00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:54.650
Prometheus's is a huge pack
of web controls built on

186
00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:58.310
top of Microsoft ASP, net,
Ajax, which will add previously

187
00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:02.720
impossible performance in interactivity to
your next project. Just listen

188
00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.870
to this. The new controls
mirror, the ASP net Ajax

189
00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:11.090
API. So development is straight
forward. Client scripts are shared.

190
00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:14.060
So loading time is pretty
much instant. And if you

191
00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:15.800
just set a couple of
properties, you'll be able to

192
00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:19.820
automatically bind to web services
for even more efficient operation.

193
00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:22.940
After all the facts speak
for themselves, the new rad

194
00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:26.270
editor for ASP net Ajax
loads up to four times

195
00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:30.680
faster than before. Similarly, rad
grid handles thousands of records

196
00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:33.950
in mere milliseconds. But again,
it's best to try for

197
00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:40.010
yourself visit tellerik.com/asp net Ajax,
and download a trial. And

198
00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:44.000
don't forget to thank them
for supporting Hansel minutes. No,

199
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.890
you bring up an interesting
point though. We've, we've spoken

200
00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:49.020
about people making $50,000, a
hundred thousand dollars in, in

201
00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:53.530
India, living in quarter of
a million dollar condos, but

202
00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:56.890
then you just spoke of
illiterate. People do there, there

203
00:11:56.890 --> 00:12:00.220
is a societal cast system,
the classic kind of, you

204
00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:03.490
know, Brahm and through untouchable
system in India that is

205
00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:07.420
still applied. Whether people acknowledge
it or not, it's still

206
00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:09.700
exists. But now don't you
think that there is a

207
00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:12.670
parallel economic system? I mean,
we're talking about people living

208
00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:15.250
on a dollar a month
and people living on a

209
00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:18.640
hundred thousand dollars. Don't you
think that there's going to

210
00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:21.850
be a pretty significant more
than in any other countries

211
00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:25.170
schism between the haves and
the have nots. Let's see,

212
00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:29.370
one of the difference between
probably about between China and

213
00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:33.330
India yet is the value.
The economy actually drills down

214
00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:36.270
a lot more in India.
That's my personal opinion Because

215
00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:40.050
you mean it drills down,
trickled It trickle down. So

216
00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:43.530
if somebody is earning 10,000,
$20,000 a year, he gets

217
00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:46.140
a driver. See, one of
the most difficult people to

218
00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:48.990
recruit in India in the
urban cities is a driver

219
00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:53.160
is a child chattier to
drive you and chauffeur Chaffer

220
00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:56.370
to drive you. And they
are very expensive. Their salaries

221
00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:58.680
are like doubled or tripled
in the last few years.

222
00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:02.220
And you have maids. You
have people who help you

223
00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:06.510
and the ecosystem, the money
actually drills down, trickle down.

224
00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:10.410
You're a Reagan economic you're
you believe in Reaganomics, Ronald Reagan

225
00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:12.030
believed in this notion of
trickle down kind of, but

226
00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:14.700
not, you know, when the
success at one level trickles

227
00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:17.760
down to the entire system
and everyone wins, It definitely

228
00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:21.060
happens. And there's also a
cultural difference in India. People

229
00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:24.240
don't like to show off
the belt in general, even

230
00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:27.930
if you're wealthy, you don't
show off that Except when

231
00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:32.460
you get married. Yes. Because
I think that people who

232
00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:35.070
make a dollar a month
don't rent an elephant. Yes.

233
00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:38.820
Okay. So that trickle effect
is happening. And one of

234
00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:41.220
the biggest challenges is how
do you help the rural

235
00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:47.010
economy recently? In one of
the DBS, I read like

236
00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:50.520
60% of Indian population resides
in the rural, but then

237
00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:54.660
only 38% of them actually
are into agriculture. So you

238
00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:59.220
have like 72% or 62%
of people who are in

239
00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:02.970
rural city, rural area, but
are not doing agriculture. How

240
00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:05.220
do you keep them employed?
That's the biggest challenge in

241
00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:07.140
front of the government? Two
thirds of people who live

242
00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:11.630
in rural areas are not
actively farming. Yes. What are

243
00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:17.040
they doing? Well, they do
a lot of other activities.

244
00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:21.240
In fact, we were involved
in government of India program,

245
00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:24.750
which right now has run
into a controversy for other

246
00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:30.240
reasons, which was meant to
give employment to a lot

247
00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:33.510
of people, employment for things
like building roads are, you

248
00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:37.350
know, creating canals. So the
government was supposed to do

249
00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:41.250
this and it went on
for quite awhile. But recently,

250
00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:43.350
very recently, in fact, as
recently as last week, there

251
00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:49.410
was some controversy about irregularities
in that system. But a

252
00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:51.470
lot of people are sitting
in an employed. A lot

253
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:55.880
of people Are doing a
daily wages work in that.

254
00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:59.030
So in fact, when you
talk about this large chasm

255
00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:02.900
between the haves and the
have nots, it's mostly in

256
00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:06.950
the metropolitan areas. I think
the six 66 big cities

257
00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:09.890
in India, the rest of
India is still in that.

258
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.200
Well, not rural, but semi-urban
to rural just outside of

259
00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:21.140
town. Right? Exactly. Exactly. Yeah.
Interestingly again, one of the

260
00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:24.140
biggest phenomenon in India, which
is happening is the retail

261
00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:28.790
retail, boom. Walmart decided with
a local partner in India

262
00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:32.000
to do retails. And initially,
even as recently as three,

263
00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:35.330
four years, we ourselves were,
well, we were skeptical about

264
00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:38.720
our retail will work. There's
political backlash saying that retail

265
00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:42.350
is an MNC, an organized
thing, taking over the smaller

266
00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:45.470
mom and pop shops, which
actually gives about 80, 90%

267
00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:49.030
of the people in rural
urban areas. Everyone in India

268
00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:51.190
owns a mom and pop
shop. Yeah, Yes. Kind of.

269
00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:53.950
And they're pretty successful in
that. And so there was

270
00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:57.340
a huge dark on that
political backlash, but one of

271
00:15:57.340 --> 00:16:00.520
the things that are now
emerging is the rural people

272
00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:05.470
are also adapting. They have
this need for organized retail.

273
00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:08.650
So a popular chain in
India is called pantaloons. They

274
00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:11.950
are part of a future
group. One of the, in

275
00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:14.740
the Kesha Biani is their
CEO. He talks about in

276
00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:19.570
his book saying the retail
outlets in ruler actually do

277
00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:23.260
much more turnovers than some
of their urban outlet turnover

278
00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:26.350
of product. They move more
product. Yes. And they say,

279
00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:28.630
and he says, it's not
the same package stuff that

280
00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:31.330
excelled there, but I sell
oil and loose. Meaning you

281
00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:34.090
can bring a bottle by
oil, they will just measure

282
00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:35.740
it and pour it down.
So it's not in the

283
00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:38.830
packet. It's not about hygiene.
Hygiene is important. You're saying

284
00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:41.440
that they provide services that
a large place just can't

285
00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:43.900
effectively provide. Correct. So what
he says is we are

286
00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:47.140
organized, but we have to
be tailored, right? What's happening.

287
00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:49.540
That's what's happening to retail
in the U S that

288
00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:52.600
when a retailer comes in
and they commoditize something, then

289
00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:55.900
a small amount and pop
shop provides a specialty, provide

290
00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:58.990
special service or attentiveness. They
say that we'll we'll, we

291
00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:01.180
answer the phone when you
call us as opposed to

292
00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:04.240
you getting a recording. And
then of course there's a

293
00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:06.310
back and forth as retail
tries to make that happen.

294
00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:10.360
Sure. In fact, one of
the cultures that have very

295
00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:11.860
recently come up, I think
in the, probably in the

296
00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:14.800
last two years is the
model culture. Something that's been

297
00:17:14.830 --> 00:17:18.250
around in us for awhile.
And in the last two

298
00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:21.730
years, if you see India
has had so many models

299
00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:23.800
come up, my city that
I live in Gorgon, which

300
00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:27.790
is a suburb of Delhi
has already something like 17

301
00:17:28.090 --> 00:17:31.660
huge models. And, and well,
it's a suburb of Delhi,

302
00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:34.960
but you go to almost
any semi urban city. Now

303
00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:38.710
it has a large mall
with probably all the international

304
00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:41.590
brands that you can think
of Nike and Adidas and

305
00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:46.510
Reebok. And everybody's there McDonald's.
So you get French fries,

306
00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:50.790
even in a small little
tiny city. So that's, you

307
00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:53.520
know, that that globalization culture
has already come in and

308
00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:57.080
everybody is aware of it.
And everybody is Taking part

309
00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:00.670
in that as, as, as,
as citizens of your, of

310
00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:03.320
your nation. What do you,
do you feel that the,

311
00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:07.520
the kind of the Metta
virus of America's Mehta culture

312
00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:11.420
has infected your culture? I
mean, do you really think

313
00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:14.690
that once every single square
inch of this planet is

314
00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:17.540
covered in malls and I
can buy a coach bag

315
00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:19.790
in any city in the
world? That that's a good

316
00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:23.840
thing. I mean, I mean,
malls are opening and closing

317
00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:26.840
retails, like retail space in
America right now is, is

318
00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:29.210
that the inventory is at
an all time high. And

319
00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:32.000
it's something like 25% of
retail spaces, wide open there's

320
00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:35.450
buildings going up. And then
they'll sit there for months

321
00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:38.570
with a, for lease sign,
because we got a little

322
00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:41.330
ahead of ourselves. It seems
to me like, this is

323
00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:45.920
not a sustainable system, and
now we're exporting it to

324
00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:48.650
you guys. It makes me
sad if you're telling me

325
00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:52.520
the small town you live
in is a yes, Absolutely.

326
00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:55.340
I mean, what you said
is absolutely right. I mean,

327
00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:57.890
we, as I said again,
17 miles and you know,

328
00:18:57.890 --> 00:19:01.640
probably a 20 square kilometer,
A city, how many people

329
00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:06.590
in your city In, in
Google? Probably about few million.

330
00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:09.950
We've gotten a million in
Portland where I live and

331
00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:14.840
we've got maybe four good
malls, but there's at least

332
00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:17.120
30, 40 miles between each
one. I mean, they're really

333
00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:19.820
spread out. Yeah. And inside
those malls, there's a lot

334
00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:23.150
of places going out of
business, Right. This is a

335
00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:27.260
20 square kilometer in a
suburb of new Delhi and

336
00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:31.040
17 miles. Many of them
are sitting MTM as a,

337
00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:33.680
you know, as, as you
rightly put it. But to

338
00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:35.780
answer the second part of
your question, whether I think

339
00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:40.490
that it's getting infected well,
infection is too strong a

340
00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:44.810
word, but yes, there are.
I think, I think, Well,

341
00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:46.790
it's a bit of a
rash more than that infection,

342
00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:49.100
but it's a big it's
spreading. Yeah. It is spreading.

343
00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:52.370
Some things are good because
hopefully what we can do

344
00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:55.730
is pick up the good
parts of it. We have

345
00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:58.520
done that before, as, as
vinca mentioned, right. From McGill

346
00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:03.110
times and recently up to
the masala pizzas that we

347
00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:07.370
have. So, you know, we
do adapt and we do

348
00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:11.360
pick up the good things
from, from, you know, whoever

349
00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:14.720
invades us in different ways,
But you're picking up consumerism.

350
00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:16.970
Yes. Then that's different. I
mean, you can pick up,

351
00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:19.310
you can, you can make
a Curry pizza and you

352
00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:22.460
can take the sacred cows
out of the hamburger. But

353
00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:27.650
ultimately though you are now
consuming and throwing away. I

354
00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:30.290
think it's, it's more a
short term thing that these

355
00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:32.450
mile models are coming up
in India. But over a

356
00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:36.290
period it'll stabilize that is
a huge need for 20,

357
00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:38.720
30 years. People didn't have
this, so they wanted all

358
00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:41.180
this. They didn't have it.
So everybody's just rushing to

359
00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:44.900
it. And the matter shall
kind of equally equal itself

360
00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:50.340
to want is a very,
very Strong. Yes. And, but

361
00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:53.370
I think a consumerism, you
pointed out that brings in

362
00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:55.740
a very interesting thing. Every
time when I come to

363
00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:57.420
the U S one of
the things that it's me

364
00:20:57.420 --> 00:21:00.510
is the amount of food
that you get everywhere. And

365
00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:03.240
the amount of food you're
waste because in my culture,

366
00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:06.210
right, from my school days,
my mother will kill me.

367
00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:08.640
Even if I waste something
in the dinner or in

368
00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:11.310
the lunch we had, we
were made to value each

369
00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:14.250
and every race piece that
we get in the table,

370
00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:16.770
but yet in the U
S that's, that's something that

371
00:21:16.770 --> 00:21:19.350
really scares me, worries me
when I have to eat

372
00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:22.350
something and throw away the
rest 50%, that really troubled.

373
00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:25.200
So the reason I'm saying
that, so even if miles

374
00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:28.110
come to India, they will
be over a period adapted

375
00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:32.940
to the Indian way of
doing things. Interesting. Interesting. How

376
00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:36.300
do you feel from, from
your country looking into ours,

377
00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:39.630
do you feel sympathetic when
you see on the news

378
00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:43.110
that Americans feel that, that
you're taking jobs and do

379
00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:46.770
you feel that we're taking
jobs from you? I don't

380
00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:50.700
think so. Because in a
globalized world, these things will

381
00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:52.380
happen at over a period.
I think it is for

382
00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:55.830
the good. So overall, I
think even if you look

383
00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:58.080
at the U S economy
with the oil prices, going

384
00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:02.100
with VOD, everything, the still
the economy is growing or

385
00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:03.810
what all the world is
alts while the economy is

386
00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:08.340
also growing. So globalization definitely
works in the short terms.

387
00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:10.200
We have to give some
price, but I think that's

388
00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:12.930
where the local governments can
control and save God the

389
00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:16.860
people's short term interest or
the long term. So it

390
00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:18.990
kind of from India, looking
at the U S it's

391
00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:23.250
more neutral because as it
sets out 70%, 80% of

392
00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:26.370
the people don't even have
an impact on us or

393
00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:31.020
what happening that, but the
knew about us. So it's

394
00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:33.630
definitely that opinion will be
not neutral because they are

395
00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:37.080
not affected by any of
the things that happen. Well,

396
00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:38.790
I really appreciate you guys
taking a moment to sit

397
00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:40.950
down with me today. I
appreciate both of your perspectives,

398
00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:44.040
and this has been another
episode of Hanselminutes and we'll

399
00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:46.590
see you again next week.
Thank you. Thank you.
