<inaudible>. Hi, this is Scott

8
00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.960
Hanselman. This is another episode
of Hansel minutes. And today

9
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.590
I'm talking with Pam and
Cine from open collective and

10
00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.260
democracy earth. How are you?
Good, Scott, how are you?

11
00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.050
I'm great. I'm very excited
to talk to you today

12
00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.710
because I'm hearing more and
more from my friends, from

13
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.120
my community about OpenCollective and
how exciting it is for

14
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.900
people doing open source projects.
So I started digging around

15
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.770
and trying to learn more
about you, your background and

16
00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.230
the kinds of things that
you've been involved in. And

17
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.440
it sounds like you have
a very deep interest in

18
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.330
democracy as a concept Indeed.
And most of my career

19
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:29.090
has been revolved around democracy
and politics. So that's my

20
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.700
background. That's where I come
from. And that's certainly where

21
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.700
my interest lies. Where did
that start? Have you, were

22
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.490
you a, like a child
always interested in 10 years

23
00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.640
old in democracy or when
did this That's excellent. That

24
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.580
is actually true. I've always
been interested in politics. Like

25
00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.510
my house was how's where
we would fight for over

26
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.910
them. The newspaper in the
mornings and, and politics was

27
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.970
always part of the conversation.
So I was always interested

28
00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.990
in democracy and institutions in
general and how they affect

29
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:06.110
us. And I worked in
politics most of my life

30
00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.070
from sort of every aspect
of it from think-tanks to

31
00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:16.250
campaigning, to running for office,
myself, to working for government.

32
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.110
So it's been, it's been
quite a challenging ride. Did

33
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.930
you always agree with your
parents and your family as

34
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.880
you argued? Or did you,
how did you develop your

35
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.790
own perspective or did you
adopt theirs? Well, my family

36
00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:38.240
has like a very political
history from very different ideological

37
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.670
viewpoints. So it's, it's hard
to agree with. It was

38
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.190
always hard to agree with
everyone and to fight with

39
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.980
everyone. So I think that
I've been kind of molded

40
00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:58.300
in a way by, by
those conversations, but definitely well,

41
00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.820
depends on the period of
my life. I was more

42
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.460
combative if you want. In
my teenage years, I definitely

43
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.650
wouldn't see eye to eye
with my father in most

44
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.690
of the conversations, but I
dunno it sometimes it's hard

45
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.600
to pick what's ideology and
what's just growing up, right?

46
00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:24.780
What is liquid democracy? So
liquid democracy is it's an

47
00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:31.350
understanding of democracy that kind
of removes the territorial basis

48
00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.490
for legitimacy and power. Essentially,
the way our institutions are

49
00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.450
structured, our political system is
structured today, revolves around the

50
00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:45.600
territory. And we are represented
by people, professional citizens that

51
00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.520
we called politicians or representatives.
And we are represented because

52
00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.350
of the place that we
happen to be living at

53
00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.680
or worse where we were
born in. And it would

54
00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.780
democracy proposes to flip that
equation and say that we

55
00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.930
can actually be represented by
anyone. There's no reason why

56
00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.550
I can only be represented
by Argentina or Argentinian representatives.

57
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.690
I'd rather be maybe represented
by, I don't know, say

58
00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.190
on climate change by <inaudible>
or a group of likeminded

59
00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.080
individuals or a city that
is extremely progressive in their

60
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.030
energy policies, but we are
kind of stuck to the

61
00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.960
territorial basis for political organizations
because that's what we've inherited

62
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.470
because of the time that
our political institutions were designed,

63
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.790
the best communication technology at
the time was, was the

64
00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:44.220
post the mail. And so
there wasn't really a lot

65
00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.230
more that they could design,
but that obviously the internet

66
00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.010
changed that and our political
institutions did not change with

67
00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.390
times. And so what we
propose is a system that

68
00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:04.950
where we can allocate our
power, our decision to different

69
00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:09.690
people for different topics, regardless
of where we're living or

70
00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.000
where we were born. So
as a concept of liquid

71
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.260
democracy, but we flipped the
idea of representation from a

72
00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:20.910
vertical territorial notion of representation,
where we essentially outsource our

73
00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.190
decision making to a group
of people for four years

74
00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.920
or two years or six
years. But for very long

75
00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.710
period of time that they
decide on our behalf on

76
00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.160
all topics, which in my
mind is just, it really

77
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.970
blows my mind. And the
idea of liquid democracy is

78
00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:40.410
that we can, everyone, anyone
can be a representative, so

79
00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.050
we can allocate that we
can trust different people for

80
00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.170
different topics. So they have
different expertise or different experiences

81
00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:52.500
regardless of, of where they
are. That's really interesting the

82
00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.300
way that you, the way
that you phrase it kind

83
00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.160
of does make it a
little bit disturbing that we

84
00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.480
would pick one individual or
two individuals from our state

85
00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.440
and then give them authority
over all topics, even if

86
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.540
they have zero expertise in
that topic. Right. Right. Which

87
00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:12.130
is essentially what we do.
And I think that what

88
00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:17.470
we're seeing today in terms
of kind of the turmoil

89
00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:21.400
that we're seeing in many
democracies has to do a

90
00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.620
little bit with this has
to do with that a

91
00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:27.820
model that is not able
to respond to the preferences

92
00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.970
of citizens that have preferences
that go beyond the territory.

93
00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:34.000
And at the same time,
it's not able to update

94
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:40.330
itself. And so there's this,
at least in my mind,

95
00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:43.870
I'm seeing this kind of
situation where our government is

96
00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.540
very out of sync with
who we are and how

97
00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:50.920
we act. And so we
are stuck with these institutions

98
00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:56.770
that we inherited, but my
argument is that, or is

99
00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:59.650
that we're not bound to
them. We own them. And

100
00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:02.920
so we can, and I
think it's our responsibility. Not

101
00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:06.790
only that we can, I
think we should redesign them

102
00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:12.130
and rethink them with the
current technology that we have.

103
00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:17.140
And with the current set
of values and beliefs and

104
00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:24.940
uneconomic settings that we have
today, like institutions are not

105
00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:28.720
created in a void. They
respond to a certain period,

106
00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:35.500
asserting education, certain economic model,
a certain technology existing at

107
00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:38.410
one point in time. And
when all of that changes,

108
00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:43.960
we must update our institutions.
It seems like it's the

109
00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:49.480
updating of institutions or the
stopping the inertia of, of

110
00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:54.010
any number of historical documents
that I think at least

111
00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:55.780
folks in America. Cause I
can only speak as an

112
00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:59.770
American get uncomfortable with whether
it be something that was

113
00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:03.070
a, you know, stone tablets
that were several thousand years

114
00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:06.340
ago or whether they were
a piece of parchment from

115
00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:08.950
a couple of hundred years
ago, they feel that certain

116
00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:12.940
things should be sacrosanct and
permanent. So the idea of

117
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.230
updating something, whether it be
because the internet or whatever

118
00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:22.810
scares people. Yeah. And look,
it makes sense. And I

119
00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:24.880
think it's not a process
that we should take lightly,

120
00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:30.100
but I think that it's
innovation needs to take place

121
00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:34.630
in this, in these spaces.
And it's very difficult for

122
00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:40.240
the start of school to
innovate because it's against their

123
00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:44.470
nature, right? Like power is
conservative by nature. It wants

124
00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:48.910
just power. So expecting the
center, expecting the status quo,

125
00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:54.360
the establishment to innovate it's
it's few child because it's

126
00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:59.220
simply not their interest. Their
preference is history. It's always

127
00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:01.230
going to be to hold
onto power. That's how the

128
00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:04.710
system is designed. So I
think that there's, you know,

129
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:09.690
what's interesting about exploring these
options in, in, in the

130
00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:12.510
fringes is that innovation is
less expensive in the fringes.

131
00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:18.120
And so it's easier to
propose kind of radical ideas

132
00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:22.500
and start testing them in
kind of sun boxes. Right.

133
00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:28.320
And then, and, and then
eventually those sandboxes are gonna

134
00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.060
get bigger or those ideas
are going to get more

135
00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:33.330
mainstream and it's, you know,
eventually we're going to end

136
00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:36.810
up updating our political system.
I mean, I I'm, I'm

137
00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:39.690
an optimist that might be
ever to aura or a

138
00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:42.840
flaw, but I am, I
am an optimist. And I,

139
00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:47.340
and I think that if
we want to kind of

140
00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:50.820
push the boundaries of, of
what it's doable, we need

141
00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:53.670
to start sort of building
alternative models and we start,

142
00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:57.480
we need to start sort
of moving them the perception

143
00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:02.810
of what is doable. So
you talk about sandboxes. So

144
00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:05.240
people who are listening to
this podcast might wonder how

145
00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:08.150
we started the first few
sentences about open source. And

146
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:12.440
then suddenly we're off talking
politics. Perhaps someone is nine

147
00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:16.580
minutes into this podcast and
they're already going to, to

148
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:19.640
stop listening because we've said
something that they don't agree

149
00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:22.460
with, but you make a
really interesting point on the

150
00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:27.200
website, democracy.earth.earth is the top
level domain. You say we

151
00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:31.280
are 21st century citizens interacting
with 19th century institutions based

152
00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:36.470
on 15th century information technology.
What is democracy earth? And

153
00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:38.810
talk to me about sandboxes
rather than from a country

154
00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:42.380
perspective, but from a small
or medium size organizational perspective.

155
00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:47.150
All right. So I mean,
democracy earth, what it tries

156
00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:50.720
to do is to see
the internet as a political

157
00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:57.350
jurisdiction and think about how
we can leverage existing technologies

158
00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:05.210
like blockchain, for example, to,
to distribute votes among different

159
00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:08.210
people. So, one, one concrete
example that we did one

160
00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:13.700
sandbox is when the, the
referendum for peace in Colombia

161
00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:18.290
took place, you could only
vote. So a couple of

162
00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:21.500
things happened. The first one
is that referendums, what they

163
00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:26.330
do is they, they turn
complex issues into a binary

164
00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:31.700
decision. Right? And so what
happened with the reference? I

165
00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:35.870
mean, Columbia is that they
got very complex and, and

166
00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:40.340
comprehensive agreement got boiled down
to, do you want, do

167
00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:42.710
you want the FARCs that
that's there? So if the

168
00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:46.250
guerrilla forces to have a
role in the Colombian political

169
00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:48.980
life yes or no, that
was pretty much eat. Right.

170
00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:54.160
And so the consequence of
doing that was that that

171
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.890
was the issue that the
whole piece sort of hanged

172
00:11:56.890 --> 00:12:00.170
on. And so it got
it wasn't approved, right? The,

173
00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:03.700
the, the, the peace agreement
was revoked by the referendum.

174
00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:08.230
So what we set out
to do before all of

175
00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:14.890
this happened was open up
a space where we could

176
00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:19.950
vote not in a single
issue, but we could, what

177
00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:22.210
we did was we sort
of divided the referendum into

178
00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:26.110
different classes, and we invited
people to vote on those

179
00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:30.010
different classes. And from all
of the classes, the first

180
00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:33.970
five got approved by a
landslide. And just the one

181
00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:37.540
from the FARC got rejected
by a landslide. So that

182
00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:39.880
was clearly the issue, right.
But almost all of the

183
00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:43.900
agreement could have passed if
we would have done something

184
00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:48.250
where, you know, a much
more comprehensive voting scenario. And

185
00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:50.350
the second thing that happened
in Columbia was that the

186
00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:55.630
diaspora wasn't allowed to vote.
Only the people in Columbia

187
00:12:55.630 --> 00:13:00.640
could vote. And we found
that very unfair. Why, you

188
00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:03.580
know, why do we expect
still in the 21st century

189
00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:07.060
for citizens to physically go
to a place, you know,

190
00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:11.920
to give them a voice
in the world. So we

191
00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.950
wanted to give us space
for the diaspora to vote.

192
00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:18.040
So this is a kind
of sandbox projects that I'm

193
00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:24.640
talking about getting, driving issues
that where we could start

194
00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:29.860
experimenting and piloting with this
kind of liquid democracy arrangements.

195
00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:35.170
It was obviously as with
any innovation we need to

196
00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:38.860
test and experiment. We don't
have the institutions that we

197
00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:41.170
have because they were built
in a day. Like we

198
00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:44.920
grew to have them here
and they developed into what

199
00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:48.010
they are now. And so
every time we talk about

200
00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.980
updating our institutions, I have
the feeling that there's this

201
00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:53.410
expectation of, well, what are
you going to bring up

202
00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:57.340
tomorrow? That's going to be
great. Right? And so our

203
00:13:57.550 --> 00:13:59.830
sort of more humble path
is like, we're going to

204
00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:02.530
be experimenting with these institutions
because the only way to

205
00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:08.890
learn is to do is
by doing. And so, yeah,

206
00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:11.470
that's sort of one example,
another example of sandboxes is

207
00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:14.020
with climate change, for example,
climate change is an issue

208
00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:15.850
that it's very clear that
it doesn't have to be

209
00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:20.870
territorial. It doesn't make sense
that only nation States invite

210
00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:25.300
invited to the table. So
that's the kind of experiments

211
00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:27.540
that we're doing. Yeah. Yeah.
And I think that from

212
00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:29.850
a technology perspective, the parts
that I think are very

213
00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:35.460
interesting are the use of
the blockchain as an accounting

214
00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:40.560
system to be incorruptible. So
that transactions cannot be removed.

215
00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:43.140
You know, it's a kind
of right. Only an append

216
00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:46.530
only. And then another one
that is interesting around liquid

217
00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:50.520
democracy is the idea of
this binary vote. Like you

218
00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:53.810
say, is simplistic. Why not
make it more like, for

219
00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:57.170
lack of a better word,
user voice, where someone gets

220
00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:59.300
a hundred votes and then
they can vote on different

221
00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:03.230
pieces depending on how strongly
they feel about something. But

222
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:05.300
when they've done that, they've
then removed their votes from

223
00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:07.850
something else. So if I
am a, a single issue

224
00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:12.140
voter, that's fine, but then
I can't, I get less

225
00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:14.660
of an opinion on another
issue that maybe I have

226
00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:17.650
less interest in. So we
can make sort of much

227
00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:23.110
more sophisticated arrangements today using
technology. And as you say,

228
00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:25.330
look, I come from a
country I'm from Argentina. And

229
00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:28.420
I come from a country
where ballot boxes are still

230
00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:33.220
stolen. I'm burns after elections.
And so having something like

231
00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:37.000
the blockchain that as you
say, it's an incorruptible ledger.

232
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.250
I think that's the most
attractive thing. So having storing

233
00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:47.320
votes and decisions on, on
a tool like that, it's

234
00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:52.510
extremely powerful, especially from someone
coming from, you know, Latin

235
00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:56.020
America or countries where, you
know, the sanctity of the

236
00:15:56.020 --> 00:16:01.240
vote is not exactly respected.
So this software is open

237
00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:04.630
source and it is a
nonprofit, people can donate. People

238
00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:09.070
can learn about a democracy
earth. How does it relate

239
00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:12.250
to open collective? Are they
different sides of the same

240
00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:14.350
coin? Are they in a
vector? How do those two

241
00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:17.590
organizations relate to each other?
Well, I'm kind of the

242
00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:20.680
connector at the moment. So
I was one of the

243
00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:25.000
founders of democracy, earth and
democracy earth is like an

244
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:31.030
evolution of many years of
doing politics in Argentina. And,

245
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.990
and when we started, we
built a political party called

246
00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:38.620
the net party and to
run for elections for Congress.

247
00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:42.610
And with this idea that
we would only vote according

248
00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:46.240
to what citizens decided on
a platform that was at

249
00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:50.350
the time called democracy that
is still exists. And so

250
00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:53.320
the idea was to, again,
flip that mandate and say,

251
00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:57.370
what we're doing is bringing
into Congress, the voices of

252
00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:00.880
thousands of citizens called one
to participate. But because the

253
00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:03.700
way the seat, the system
is designed, they're sort of

254
00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:06.940
left. You know, they're reduced
to being recipients of a

255
00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:09.760
monologue, being able to cast
a vote every couple of

256
00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:11.620
years. And that's about all
the input that the system

257
00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:16.300
accepts from them. When we
did the, the net party,

258
00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:19.180
it took us such a
long time to have our

259
00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:22.330
political party approved. Because again,
it was like asking permission

260
00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:26.350
for the status quo to
disrupt the status quo. So

261
00:17:26.350 --> 00:17:29.020
government needed to approve our
political party in order for

262
00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:34.090
us to receive donations, sort
of campaign contributions. And it

263
00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:35.980
took a very long time
for them to do it.

264
00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:42.640
Like it was insane. And
so when my business partner

265
00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:46.930
and, and old friends, the
man who's the former founder

266
00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:51.780
of Storify, you know, he
called me a couple of

267
00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:53.580
years ago and like, Oh,
I have this project that

268
00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:57.240
I've been thinking about scallop
and collective. And I'd like

269
00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:59.010
you to come on board
as a cofounder. For me,

270
00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:03.210
it was a no brainer
because that was essentially, he

271
00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:06.090
was talking to me specifically
about the problem that we

272
00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:08.850
were suffering, that we had
suffered, you know, gentiana without

273
00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:12.060
political party. That is like,
you know, the amount of

274
00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:14.970
red tape that is expected
from organizations in order to

275
00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:20.220
start operating. It's a blocker
for most of these organizations,

276
00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:23.970
it's a blocker for so
many amazing ideas to thrive

277
00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:28.680
and experiment and build those
sandboxes. And so I just,

278
00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:31.080
you know, I, I will
say that I was pregnant

279
00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:34.110
nine months pregnant, so it
was good timing from him,

280
00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:38.880
but I just jumped at
the opportunity of, of helping

281
00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:44.160
create the organizations that I
thought would use liquid democracy

282
00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:50.370
in the future because our,
our, the system is understands

283
00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:55.140
corporations, either profit or nonprofit,
but understands corporations as the

284
00:18:55.590 --> 00:19:01.170
political, economic and human unit,
or just the individual kind

285
00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:04.800
of freelancer or atomized. But
there's something that sits in

286
00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:10.110
between. It's a community, the
collective networks, mission-driven groups of

287
00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:13.800
people that have amazing ideas.
They want to carry them

288
00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:15.990
out. They want to test
them. They want to start

289
00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:19.710
building support from them, but
in order to do it,

290
00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:21.990
they need to have a
legal entity somewhere in the

291
00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:26.670
world. And think about open
source projects, think about any

292
00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:31.160
open source project that more
often than not just developers

293
00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:37.280
that are come together online,
they create great technology together,

294
00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:41.690
but they're from many different
countries. And that idea for

295
00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:45.830
them building out an LLC,
five, a one C three,

296
00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:49.580
a corporation where in the
United States, in Europe, in India,

297
00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:54.560
right. In order to receive
contributions for their work on

298
00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:58.850
starter. So that's where we
sort of come in with

299
00:19:58.850 --> 00:20:04.610
open collective, you know, creating
these virtual associations and sharing

300
00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:11.210
mutualizing resources among different collectives
and communities of people to

301
00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:13.820
just help them focus on
what they do best it's

302
00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:17.450
their work. Instead of having
to worry about legal entities

303
00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:22.790
and accountants and lawyers and
equity, or cause a prescient

304
00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:27.440
or an organization. I always
say that expecting an open

305
00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:31.400
source project, a collective, a
mission driven network, a global

306
00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:36.230
social movement to have a
command and control structure and

307
00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:38.090
to have a precedent it's
like asking call that, of

308
00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:42.170
course the prescient of the
internet is equally ridiculous, right?

309
00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:47.030
Because it's just so far
away from how we operate,

310
00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:51.370
how we are and how
we structure ourselves studies almost

311
00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:55.210
impossible for us to fit
into these kind of squares

312
00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:58.510
that government expects us to
fit. So OpenCollective what tries

313
00:20:58.510 --> 00:21:01.780
to do is to enable
anyone to have a virtual

314
00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:05.440
association and start raising some
funds and spend them in

315
00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:10.540
full transparency without needing a
legal entity. And if any

316
00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:13.390
of them, that's what they
want to do then that's

317
00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:17.760
great. But you know, it's
like having one Negal entity

318
00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:22.090
or collectivistic having one server
per content, you have a

319
00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:25.920
nine it's simply, it doesn't
make sense. So just let

320
00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:28.740
me help, help me understand
just in, in, in very

321
00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:32.160
clear terms I could make,
I could, I have a

322
00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:34.680
number of open source projects,
but it's just me. I

323
00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:36.960
could go off and hire
lawyers if I were rich

324
00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:41.370
and make a nonprofit, make
a five Oh one C,

325
00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:45.510
but with open collective, I
can sign up. Is there

326
00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:48.000
a <inaudible> or are we
saying that this is a,

327
00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:50.850
a construct that does not
require one in this context?

328
00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:53.430
No, there is. And there's
a host and we call

329
00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:58.230
them host organizations. So essentially
they OpenCollective platform. What it

330
00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:01.920
has underneath is a network
of host organizations that are

331
00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:05.790
organizations that what they do
is they virtualize their entities

332
00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:09.180
and host these collectives. They
act as a service. They

333
00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:15.750
receive the funds for these
collectives. They oversee their expenses

334
00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:18.840
and then they reimburse them
or pay for their invoices

335
00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:21.840
and because everything is done
through the platform and everything's

336
00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:25.440
done in full transparency, it's
quite safe for these host

337
00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:29.400
organizations to, to act as
hosts. So Alma collective, for

338
00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:31.770
example, is the host organization
for all the open source

339
00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:36.270
projects it's called, I'm sorry,
the open source collective. And

340
00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:38.490
we filed already for a
five Oh one six, six

341
00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:45.090
that we're waiting for approval.
And so if you go

342
00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:51.720
online and create a collective
in opencollective.com/create or opensource slash

343
00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:54.660
create that connects you directly
to get hub, then we

344
00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:58.950
would be receiving those fundings,
those funds for you. And

345
00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:01.620
whenever you want to spend
them, you need to submit

346
00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:04.710
an invoice or a receipt
to be reimbursed to your

347
00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:09.660
collective. And then we, we
cover that. Ah, interesting. So

348
00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:14.430
for example, I've gone up
here to opencollective.com/webpack. Webpack is

349
00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:18.630
a popular JavaScript tool. And
you know, I'm not logged

350
00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:22.050
in, I'm just an anonymous
viewer. I can see here

351
00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:25.200
that they have approximately a
hundred thousand dollar annual budget.

352
00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:28.530
I can scroll down. I
can see someone just made

353
00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:32.130
a $5 monthly donation. I
can click on, see all

354
00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:37.110
expenses and I can look
down here and see someone

355
00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:42.060
just took out $300 for
documentation. So I'm literally an

356
00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:46.190
anonymous person and I'm looking
at their expenses. I can

357
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:49.100
even see here that one
of the organizers, Sean took

358
00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:53.420
a Lyft ride and took
$51 and 29 cents out. So

359
00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:57.620
there's no way to hide
or smuggle or launder money

360
00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:02.080
in this process. It's completely
transparent. It's exactly. It's that

361
00:24:02.170 --> 00:24:04.330
it's transparent. Like there's no
way you can get money

362
00:24:04.330 --> 00:24:08.530
out of a platform if
it's not yeah. Expense that

363
00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:11.620
is going to be public.
As far as the associations

364
00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:16.270
of, of this generation are
transparent. Every system that we've

365
00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:20.080
incorporated is, is designed for
corporations that compete in a

366
00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:24.010
scarcity driven economy. I think
that our generation is different.

367
00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:26.980
We want to collaborate. We
want to help one another.

368
00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:29.530
We share information with one
another. We live and breathe

369
00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:34.700
open source. And so like
our financial contributions for our,

370
00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:38.020
our collectives and the way
we spend that money, they

371
00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:40.960
should also be transpired. And
so what we set out

372
00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:46.420
to do was like transparent
ledger, a financial ledger that

373
00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:51.130
is transparent by design. Interesting.
Do you think, what would,

374
00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:53.290
let me ask you, this
is the growth such that

375
00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:55.240
this has hit a nerve.
This is more, it's not

376
00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:57.790
a, go-fund me, it's more
of a Patrion for open

377
00:24:57.790 --> 00:25:02.320
source. Is the growth of
your organization such that the

378
00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:04.990
internet has accepted this and
says, yes, this was what

379
00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:07.720
we were missing all the
time, For sure. In open

380
00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:11.680
source that has been ours.
So we are not just

381
00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:15.910
an open source. So we
are an open source platform,

382
00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:18.790
but our collectives are not
only from the open source

383
00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:23.050
community. We also have collectives
from like democracy earth. It's

384
00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:26.050
a collective and we have
a collective for the city

385
00:25:26.050 --> 00:25:30.070
of Brussels, for example. So
yeah, it's a city. So

386
00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:34.840
any initiative citizen initiative in
Brussels, it's part of the

387
00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:37.870
Brussels together collective. And so
what we do is which

388
00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:40.690
has helped them mutualize all
of these resources. So instead

389
00:25:40.690 --> 00:25:45.220
of every initiative, having their
own legal entity and accounting

390
00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:48.700
fees, and again, lawyers, we
just share that amongst all

391
00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:51.040
the initiatives on the network.
So it's much more efficient

392
00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:53.050
and you can be up
and running in one day.

393
00:25:53.770 --> 00:25:56.050
Okay. So this means that
when we go to the

394
00:25:56.050 --> 00:25:58.360
homepage or when we hear
about open collective in the

395
00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:01.030
news, because open source is
such an important part of

396
00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:03.130
the internet, we hear about
it more, but if I

397
00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:05.350
want to create a collective,
it could be a parent

398
00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:09.370
teacher association or a robotics
club for kids, or any

399
00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:13.240
a co op for gardening.
Absolutely. We have clubs, we

400
00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:17.020
have political parties, we have
social movements and we have

401
00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:20.980
a lot of open source
projects. I think that we've

402
00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:23.170
had a lot of pull
from the open source community

403
00:26:23.170 --> 00:26:25.900
that I think that you're
right in asking that question.

404
00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:30.880
It really hit a nerve
there. I think that in

405
00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:33.910
the opensource world, we still
need to shift gears on

406
00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:38.320
the sponsor side of things.
So there's clearly a need

407
00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:42.580
for open source projects to
have some sort of level

408
00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:47.280
of, and just receive funding
and to receive it transparently.

409
00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:52.020
But so what, what we
need to work more and

410
00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:55.440
push more is so the
other side of the equation,

411
00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:59.010
who's making those contributions and
those donations, and obviously a

412
00:26:59.010 --> 00:27:01.860
Webpack is I expect heading
a lot of, of these

413
00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:06.390
in terms of the funding
that they're getting and how

414
00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:09.090
they are. So what we
are enabling them with open

415
00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:13.410
collective is to sell office
hours to sub support, to

416
00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:20.760
companies that are making contributions,
for example. So I company

417
00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:24.570
makes her $10,000 contribution per
month. And it has, it

418
00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:27.810
has access to 10 hours
of support from the Webpack

419
00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:30.480
core team for that month.
And all of that would

420
00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:34.580
be tracked on of that
strict. Absolutely. Yeah. That would

421
00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:37.970
be amazing because I could
definitely see a company saying,

422
00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:39.710
well, I love Webpack. I
want to give a thousand

423
00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:42.740
dollars a month and I
want to have that kind

424
00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:46.460
of, I want to have
them on retainer. For example,

425
00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:49.700
I have legal insurance through
a company called prepaid legal.

426
00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.730
I've never actually used it,
but it's nice to know

427
00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:55.090
that it's available if I
need their support for someone.

428
00:27:55.850 --> 00:27:58.490
Yeah. So what they do
also is like they do

429
00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:02.510
one day workshops inside of
the companies as well for

430
00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:09.470
like subscriptions where testing now
I knew, and I think

431
00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:12.140
this is super interesting. Like
there's a lot of people

432
00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:15.800
who have very popular websites
and that they want to

433
00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:19.010
also give back to the
open source community, but they

434
00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:23.330
don't necessarily have funding right
themselves. And so something that

435
00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:28.220
we are that we're testing
now is having using an

436
00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:33.650
ad network called carbon ads
and to place ads in

437
00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:38.030
those websites. And then all
revenue goes straight to an

438
00:28:38.030 --> 00:28:41.060
OpenGov active, so to Webpack
or to the open source

439
00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:45.080
collective. So it's a way
for online publishers that have

440
00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:48.860
popular networks, it popular websites
to be able to contribute

441
00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:52.220
back to open source as
well. So those kinds of

442
00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:55.790
experiments are the kind of
things that we do everyday,

443
00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:58.850
like would rack our brains,
trying to think of ways

444
00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:01.880
where we help in how
we going to help open

445
00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:09.260
source projects find a path
towards sustainability. Hmm. So what

446
00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:11.450
would you say to the
listeners, what that date, what

447
00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:13.940
they can do, can they
contribute? Should they just go

448
00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:18.330
and try to find their,
their favorite organization and, and,

449
00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:23.330
and become a sponsor? Can
they sponsor OpenCollective directly So

450
00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:26.030
they can do one of
those things. They can sponsor

451
00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:29.450
the open source collective directly.
This that would go to

452
00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:33.170
the umbrella organization. It would
help us fund the fiber

453
00:29:33.170 --> 00:29:36.320
one to six that we've
created and we're waiting for

454
00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:40.250
approval, or they can find
their, you know, open source

455
00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:44.380
project that they, and give
them something, anything, $2 a

456
00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:47.920
month, whatever, or just a
one time, $25 donation, whatever

457
00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:53.890
anyone can afford, everything helps.
And also we are open

458
00:29:53.890 --> 00:29:56.920
source. So if someone out
there has a, an idea

459
00:29:57.040 --> 00:30:01.480
of how we can help
or electives get revenue, you

460
00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:05.890
know, like this ad project
that I was mentioning, or

461
00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:09.370
we, for example, we integrate
it, but we, you know,

462
00:30:09.370 --> 00:30:11.680
with Threadless. So if you
have a collective, you can

463
00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:14.800
sell swag on line now
and all the earnings go

464
00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:19.630
to your collective. So anything
like that, you know, we're

465
00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:24.040
always looking for creative ways
of helping our collectives get

466
00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:28.170
more funding and structure their
organizations better. This is a,

467
00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:30.810
it's definitely a very new,
interesting way of thinking about

468
00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:33.780
governance. How do you make
sure that the people who

469
00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:37.200
are involved are really the
people. If someone decided that

470
00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:40.470
if I decided to hijack
a organization and declare that

471
00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:42.540
I was in charge and
take the money, how would

472
00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:47.280
that be possible? It wouldn't
sell at first because the

473
00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:49.710
only way of creating an
open source collective is through

474
00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:54.420
GitHub. You actually need to
be a contributor to that

475
00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:57.510
gig. He'd have repo. If
not, it just won't show

476
00:30:57.510 --> 00:31:00.180
up. You can say, I
have what I can not

477
00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:03.450
be a contributor to Webpack.
So that's one, one thing.

478
00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:07.410
And then the other one
is every time someone submits

479
00:31:07.410 --> 00:31:10.290
an expense, the community instruct
prove it. And then the

480
00:31:10.290 --> 00:31:12.690
host organization that in this
case, it's the open source

481
00:31:12.690 --> 00:31:16.620
collective pays for it. So
the open source collective doesn't

482
00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:20.820
pay for any pending expenses.
So it has like sort

483
00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:24.330
of seal of approval from
the core team of that

484
00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:29.790
collective before the host even
thinks about paying it. That's

485
00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:32.040
really smart. It just, it
does, it does seem like

486
00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:34.080
this will scale. And it
sounds like as you move

487
00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:39.060
into new kinds of organizations,
that this could become the

488
00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:42.420
way that people support any
kind of collective on the

489
00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:46.230
internet. Oh no. So far
it's super useful for organizations

490
00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:49.950
that have multiple local chapters
that are growing Cory Santelli.

491
00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:54.480
So one, for example, now
is operation code. They are

492
00:31:54.510 --> 00:31:59.400
teaching veterans how to code
and help them get jobs

493
00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:03.660
in the tech sector. And
so they have their <inaudible>

494
00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:07.380
already. And what they do
is they're the host of

495
00:32:07.470 --> 00:32:09.720
all of their ecosystem. So
if you want to start

496
00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:13.800
an operation code in Seattle
or in, I don't know,

497
00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:17.190
San Francisco, wherever you are,
they can host you. There

498
00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:19.890
acts as your host. So
you have their sort of

499
00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:23.790
umbrella organization. And again, you
can start operating that very

500
00:32:23.790 --> 00:32:27.330
day and start raising funds,
locally, manage your budget transparently.

501
00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:30.420
They take a fee for
their strategic costs that they

502
00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:34.830
incur. And then you are
up and running with operation

503
00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:37.620
code, same way, women who
code, for example, women who

504
00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:40.820
code is a host and
open, and they have 72

505
00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:45.490
cities around the world hosted
on their own five one,

506
00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:49.030
two, three. Fantastic. I noticed
that because I mean, I'm

507
00:32:49.030 --> 00:32:51.490
in Portland, Oregon and women
who code Portland uses it

508
00:32:51.490 --> 00:32:56.140
extensively. Yep. Yep. So women
who code Portland, they don't

509
00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:58.660
have a favorite one C
three, they're just a virtual

510
00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:02.800
association hosted in women who
code. Right. Right. And I've

511
00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:05.950
actually done volunteer work with
them and I can submit

512
00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:08.020
an expense. For example, if
I were going to take

513
00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:11.650
an Uber to go and
give a talk there. Absolutely.

514
00:33:12.610 --> 00:33:16.270
So for example, another really
cool example that we did

515
00:33:16.270 --> 00:33:22.180
was during the no Muslim
ban campaign last year, not

516
00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:27.670
sorry, early this year, we
created a no Muslim ban

517
00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:32.350
collective. And we started paying
for the Lyft rides, pizza,

518
00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:36.070
water photocopies for all the
lawyers that were in San

519
00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:40.750
Francisco airport, working for free
to help people that were

520
00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:46.060
stuck behind the, as a
consequence of the ban. And,

521
00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:49.360
and so we could have
that up and running in

522
00:33:49.630 --> 00:33:55.420
two seconds. And the funding,
the funds went to <inaudible>,

523
00:33:55.450 --> 00:34:00.280
that's a political organization called
engine and advocacy organization. And

524
00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:05.650
then we've been reimbursing lawyers
for like the whole week.

525
00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:10.510
So lawyers, if you were
working pro bono, helping people

526
00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:13.240
that were stuck in the
airport, we would, you would

527
00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:15.100
just submit your Lyft, right.
And we would pay for

528
00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:20.590
it or the, you know,
or whatever you had to

529
00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:25.780
eat or the parking fees
or whatever. Very cool. So

530
00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:34.150
people can learn about opencollective@opencollectivedotcomandtheycanseedemocracyearthatdemocracy.earth
and they can find you

531
00:34:34.150 --> 00:34:39.250
on Twitter as well. Yeah,
I'm, <inaudible> on Twitter and

532
00:34:39.370 --> 00:34:43.540
at open collect, it's our
Twitter handle for open collective.

533
00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:46.360
Fantastic. Thank you so much
for chatting with me today.

534
00:34:46.810 --> 00:34:49.720
Thank you, Scott, for having
me. This has been another

535
00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:52.390
episode of Hansel minutes and
we'll see you again next

536
00:34:52.390 --> 00:34:52.570
week.
