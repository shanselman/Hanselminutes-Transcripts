Fromm Hansel minutes.com. It's Hansel
minutes, weekly discussion with web

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.260
developer and technologists. Scott Hanselman
hosted by Carl Franklin. This is

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.220
launch Ryan announcing show number
50 recorded Wednesday, February seven,

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.140
2007. Support for Hanselman it's
just provided by Dunkin developer's

www dot <inaudible> dot com.
In this episode, Scott and

7
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.490
Carl, talk about the Microsoft
open ID collaboration. Hi, this

8
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.130
is Carl Franklin. You're listening to
the Hansel minutes from Hansel

9
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.360
minutes.com. Hope you're having a
good week, Scott, how are

10
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.310
you? Oh, I'm doing okay.
We, we haven't really announced

11
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.460
on the show, but we're
moving the, the publication date

12
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.200
of the shows to Thursday.
And we're just a day

13
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.990
late today. No, sure. No
big deal. You know, this

14
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.900
is our 50th show. It
is, huh? Yeah. Wow. 50

15
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.050
Hanselman. It shows. Yeah. And
hopefully we haven't run out

16
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.780
of anything to say, I
mean, one day we'll start

17
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.800
talking about our pets, but
until then, no, we won't.

18
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.220
Of course we don't want
to waste people's time. And

19
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.000
I think we've spent just
about enough time on the

20
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.250
whole idea of that being
the 50th show. So what's

21
00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.610
the topic today, Scott? Well,
I think that we should

22
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.280
talk about open ID. We've
talked a little bit about

23
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.100
a card space in the
past. We've talked about the

24
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.180
general concept of identity on
a show recently, but given

25
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.960
the big announcement yesterday between
Microsoft and a whole pile

26
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.470
of web 2.0 companies, I
think it's worth talking about

27
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.880
what open ideas and why
our users should care. Our

28
00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.550
readers or listeners should care.
So why don't you start

29
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.000
out by just telling us
what open ideas? Okay. So

30
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.890
we know what card space
is, right? So to put

31
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.380
it in the context of
card space card space is

32
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.920
Microsoft's 2.0 attempt at solving
a lot of the problems

33
00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.770
around identity. And they're trying
to do it in a

34
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.090
very, very open way. So
they're using the Ws star

35
00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.430
protocol, trying to solve the
whole idea of, of identity

36
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.030
across the network, across the
internet for everybody, not just

37
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.040
for Microsoft users, right? Except
the, the thing that you

38
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.200
use to log in the
thing that you use to

39
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.240
express who you are and
what you know, and all

40
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.820
the different things about identity
in the card space and

41
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.840
Vista world is a Microsoft
thing. It's called an identity

42
00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.680
selector. So the, you know,
the big curtain of gray

43
00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.630
that comes over the screen
as it pops up and

44
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.320
says, give me your card
space card. That's a Microsoft

45
00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.420
thing. Now there are, as
we talked about in a

46
00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.890
previous show identity selectors for
other platforms, there's a Java

47
00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.160
based one, a Firefox three
has announced in their functional

48
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.270
requirements document that they're going
to have an identity selector

49
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.600
of their own. Now this
is all good and wonderful,

50
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.660
but kind of simultaneously going
on in the background, there

51
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.420
are lots of other people
concerned about the, the problem

52
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.290
of identity, the problem of
fishing, problem of fishing, where

53
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.120
you don't know where you're
going, you don't know where

54
00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.870
you're visiting. And then the
problem of farming, P H

55
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.500
a R M farming, which
is where user sensitive information

56
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.900
is being logged. This is
like having a key logger

57
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.640
on your machine and you
don't know your passwords being

58
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.020
typed. I forget email spam,
which is all related to

59
00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.890
identity. Absolutely. And cause some
of the things that are

60
00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.530
important about identity, what they
call the laws of identity

61
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.980
are things like user control
and consent, right? You only

62
00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.460
want to reveal information with
the user's consent, right? You

63
00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.180
want to disclose the least
possible amount of information that

64
00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.810
you need. And people need
to have a, what's called

65
00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.630
a justifiable party. You need
to make sure that the

66
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.810
disclosure of information is really
limited to those parties that

67
00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.840
are justifiable that really have
a need to know justifiable

68
00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.640
parties is the third law.
It could be called the

69
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.890
need to know law, a
need to talk about directed

70
00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.270
identity about private entities and
public entities and things like

71
00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:19.410
that. And we need to
make sure we have a

72
00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:24.660
consistent experience for, for everyone.
Kim Cameron is one of

73
00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.410
the guys at Microsoft who's
really blazed the trail for

74
00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.640
identity for, especially for card
space. Yeah, definitely. On the

75
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.620
Microsoft side, he is, he
is the man. He's the

76
00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.910
face of identity at Microsoft.
So open ID is a,

77
00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.290
is a, is an open
framework as well decentralized. And

78
00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.930
it basically introduces the idea
of a, of a U

79
00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.030
R I, which is an
old idea, right? And not

80
00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.690
a URL, but a URL
URI just to is a

81
00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.130
uniform resource identifier, which is
what a URL is. So

82
00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.770
URL is a subset of
a URI URI as the

83
00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.190
general idea of having a
protocol and a colon and,

84
00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.730
and what else, but you
know, a URL is an

85
00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:11.880
HDDP construct. Exactly, exactly. So
typically when you log in

86
00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.180
somewhere, of course you use
your username and your password.

87
00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.210
And unfortunately, a lot of
people have the same password

88
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.020
duplicated everywhere. So if someone
got ahold of one of

89
00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.390
my passwords now, you know,
personally, I use a different

90
00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.820
password for every site, but
I've got a tool that

91
00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.610
helps make that possible. But
if I was using foo

92
00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.860
for my password everywhere, and
someone found that out, they

93
00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.050
could log in to Amazon
and use my password. They

94
00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.540
could log into new egg
and use my password. And

95
00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.790
I couldn't change it in
a, in a, in one

96
00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:44.550
location. Now passport was the
Microsoft, Hey, handle your identity

97
00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:48.690
through us. We'll handle it
for you. Open ID. You

98
00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:53.250
could almost be called a
open and decentralized passport in

99
00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:57.890
that no one can necessarily
control this. You, you take

100
00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.830
control of your own identity.
And what they do is

101
00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.980
they take the concept of
a URI and they expand

102
00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:08.530
it to a user centric,
identity or identity. So in

103
00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:12.790
other words, your username is
a URI, right? And what's

104
00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:15.130
the most common URI that
people have. They have their

105
00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:20.830
website, right? So your website
address like hanselman.com can then

106
00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.680
become your URI because that's
something that you have, you

107
00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.260
actually own that. Okay. That's
a really important thing to

108
00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:30.400
just double mention because when
I think of a URI

109
00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.250
being an identity, I think
of like, you know, the,

110
00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.520
the addresses and identifiers we
used to use for remoting

111
00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.460
and for, you know, calm
and, and all sorts of

112
00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:43.870
crazy long URLs that are
cryptic, but you're right. I

113
00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:47.680
mean, your blog, your website,
any, because you own it

114
00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:52.750
that represents you. And it's
also very easy to when

115
00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:54.880
it is your website to
go there and make sure

116
00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:59.650
that it is you, If
you want to, to use

117
00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:01.540
your blog, like I'm sure
many of our listeners either

118
00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.580
have a blog or have
a, a website that they

119
00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:05.770
control. Maybe it's somewhere that
they put their family pictures

120
00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:08.380
and they want to use
that domain as their open

121
00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:12.700
ID. It's, it's pretty straightforward.
Actually. You can just go

122
00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:16.690
to hanselman.com and do a
view source and look right

123
00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:20.290
in the meta-tags there for
two different links. You'll see

124
00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:23.800
links that point to an
open ID server because my,

125
00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:30.220
my system isn't necessarily an
open ID Provider. Yeah. I

126
00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:32.650
want to use the URI.
I want to use my

127
00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:35.890
URI hanselman.com. So what I
do is I put links

128
00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:41.920
in my blogs, HTML that
point to who's handling who

129
00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:45.070
I'm delegating this work to.
So what you do is

130
00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:47.800
you go to my open
id.com and you sign up

131
00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.470
for an open ID. So
I did that because open

132
00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:55.540
idea.com is a, an open
ID provider. And then I

133
00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:58.930
just point from the source
code of the HTML of

134
00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:00.820
my website. And this is
really easy. Even if you

135
00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:03.700
have a blog address and
you don't necessarily control the

136
00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:06.490
domain, you can add this
to your blogs template. It

137
00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:09.370
doesn't show up. It's not
seen by anyone. And then

138
00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:12.730
this is the way of
saying, Oh, here's his provider

139
00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:15.820
in the duty to use
the passport and metaphor. If

140
00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:19.210
there was more than one
passport.com out there, I would

141
00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:22.120
be able to possibly use
my website address as my

142
00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:25.030
passport and passport would just
be kind of a party

143
00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:27.970
that I relaying party. Let's
get back to this whole

144
00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:31.420
idea of the provider is
the provider, the thing that

145
00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:35.680
verifies and validates your identity.
Good point. Okay, let's get

146
00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:37.360
back to that. So if
you're going to log in

147
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.570
to an open ID enabled
website, a website, that's gone

148
00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:43.780
to the effort of doing
this, this integration, which isn't

149
00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:46.900
very complicated, you would then
type in your open ID

150
00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:50.140
URI. So I could go
to a blog. Like I

151
00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:53.050
think that Simon, Simon Wilson
is a guy who's got

152
00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:54.970
a blog and I think
we've got a, a shrink,

153
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.230
a URI for him. So
I could go to his

154
00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:03.750
blog@ashrinkstir.com slash L U four.
And he explains how open

155
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:06.030
ID works. And I could
leave a comment. They are

156
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:09.030
logged into his blog and
there's a spot for entering

157
00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:11.880
in my open ID. So
this is my, my username.

158
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:13.590
Now, even though he may
not have ever heard of

159
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:17.280
me before, right? I'm not
necessarily making an account on

160
00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:21.840
his system, in the classic
username and password sense. A

161
00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.020
lot of times we want
to enable a S a

162
00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:28.000
server or an application for
something like identity. So he,

163
00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:30.920
his website is going to
go to where your website

164
00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:34.400
tells him to validate, and
that'll give him a yes

165
00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.100
or no that No. So
I enter in my open

166
00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:42.770
ID URI, and then his
website redirects me to the

167
00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:47.630
open ID provider that is
let is listed. So he

168
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:51.590
goes, and he says his,
his, his library, his open

169
00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:56.450
ID library, fetches my website
finds that link at the

170
00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:59.270
top and looks at it
and then says, ah, I

171
00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:02.000
see, we're going to parse
this HTML content, see the

172
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.310
tag for open ID server.
And then it's going to

173
00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:07.220
communicate with that server because
I've just redirected him to,

174
00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:10.940
in this case, the, my
open ID website, I'm going

175
00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:14.120
to then log in to
that website. This is why

176
00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:15.770
I use the kind of
the passport metaphor, but I

177
00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:17.330
don't want anyone to think
that this is the next

178
00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:20.150
version of passport. It was
just an example, but I'm

179
00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:23.660
giving my secret, right? My
past my password at this

180
00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:27.860
point to the centralized open
ID provider. So the provider

181
00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:30.080
is the guy who keeps
your password. Is there a

182
00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:33.020
password involved? Yeah. The past,
well, this is the trick.

183
00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:34.970
So there's nothing about open
ID that says there has

184
00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:38.360
to be a password. Certainly
this is part of what,

185
00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:39.470
and we'll get to this.
When we talk about how

186
00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:42.260
they integrated with card space,
because I'll be able to

187
00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.390
log into an open ID
provider and give them a

188
00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:47.750
card at some point, or
I could give them a,

189
00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:49.130
you know, there's nothing about
open ID that says I

190
00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:52.130
couldn't use a smart card
or some other secret, but

191
00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:56.030
I basically, I have been
redirected to the open ID

192
00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:58.370
server. And it is to
them that I need to

193
00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:00.830
prove that it's me. Right.
I have an account with

194
00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:02.480
those guys in this case.
I'll give them my name

195
00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:04.460
and my password. I don't
need to give them my

196
00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:08.060
name actually, because the consumer
let them know that, okay,

197
00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:11.630
now the, the server and
the con and the person

198
00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:15.860
who wants my information have
negotiated a, a onetime shared

199
00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:20.090
secret. And then I get
logged in and I actually

200
00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:23.960
get a, get a warning
from the open ID provider

201
00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:27.110
that says such and such
a website. You know, Simon

202
00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:31.740
Simon's website is requesting your
information. He wants your, your

203
00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:35.270
email address or whatever. Let's
say I get this warning.

204
00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:37.580
Who's me. Who's I, and
how does it come to

205
00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:40.010
you? Okay. I'm sorry. Okay.
So I'm a guy who

206
00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:42.290
wants to log into a
website. I go to an

207
00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:44.810
open ID, enabled website, like
Simon's blog. I put in

208
00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:47.930
my open ID in the
background, his blog parses that

209
00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:50.960
HTML figures out who the
server is, gets a shared

210
00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:55.330
secret temporarily with that server.
Then his, he actually redirection

211
00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:57.940
the browser. So I've actually
redirected to another website in

212
00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:01.540
the browser. That is my
open ID provider. Okay. I

213
00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:05.320
log into my open ID
provider and because enough context

214
00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:07.480
has been sent over to
that provider, he can then

215
00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:09.970
go, all right. I see
that. It's you, here's someone

216
00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:14.470
who's requesting information from you.
Is this okay? So you

217
00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:17.920
can allow Watson the browser.
I get just a webpage

218
00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:20.950
in the browser. This is
all done in HTML. There's

219
00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:25.120
nothing about open ID that
requires JavaScript. Okay. So then

220
00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.790
I'm being told by the,
this particular implementation of the

221
00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:30.370
open ID server, do you
want to allow this once

222
00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:32.860
or allow it forever? Right.
Allow it forever would be

223
00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:35.290
the way of saying, I
want to auto log into

224
00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:38.080
this guy's website just by
giving him my name, if

225
00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:39.550
I'm logged in. And I
want to be, you know,

226
00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:42.430
I want to remember my
password. Okay. Then, then the

227
00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:46.900
consumer gets redirected to the
server so that the server

228
00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:50.860
redirects back, and then it
checks to see what did

229
00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:53.740
anyone tamper with things are
there that, that shared secret?

230
00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:57.550
Is that still legit? So
there is some backwards chatter

231
00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:00.310
going on in the background.
It's not an entirely client

232
00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:03.880
side. Cause the client can
store state. You can store

233
00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:06.730
things like cookies. Now there
is an alternative state called

234
00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:10.080
the dumb mode Too ahead
of yourself. I just want

235
00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:12.420
to make sure I want
to get the consumer experience

236
00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:15.720
from this. So basically what
I'm going to do is

237
00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:17.610
when I go to login
to somebody's web log, I

238
00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:20.940
have to paste in my
URL. So it should be

239
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.730
pretty short, right? Well, short
type in your URL or

240
00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:25.830
whatever your URL type it
in and you paste it

241
00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:27.660
in or you, whatever you
do, you type it in.

242
00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:32.550
So then you're redirected to
another website that says, Hey,

243
00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:34.680
this website wants to do
such and such. And so,

244
00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:37.320
and so will you allow
them yes or no? You

245
00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:40.740
go, yes. And then you're
effectively rate rerouted back or

246
00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:43.650
redirected back to the place
that you wanted to log

247
00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:47.430
into. So that is, is
it that seamless? It really

248
00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:48.870
is. Like if I go
to right, like you can

249
00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:50.340
try this and follow with
me, even though you don't

250
00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:53.400
have an open ID, we'll
go to <inaudible> dot com.

251
00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:56.370
<inaudible> with a Y and
a, it says a little

252
00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:59.370
web 2.0 kind of cutesy
and my hot or not

253
00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:02.160
type site. It's a little
social site. And the upper

254
00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.560
corner, it says sign in
with open ID. So I

255
00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:08.460
click on that and notice
the big text box has

256
00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:11.100
a, an open ID icon
in it. It's kind of

257
00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:13.740
a orange and gray icon.
That's the kind of the

258
00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:16.080
standard way. It's a little
overlay that lives in the

259
00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:18.900
text box, a standard way
of saying I support open

260
00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:20.850
ID. Okay. You can go
ahead and try this. Carl,

261
00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:23.100
I'm going to type in
hanselman.com and my open ID.

262
00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:25.260
You go ahead and do
the same thing WVU. I'm

263
00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:28.050
actually not at a computer,
so, Oh, okay. So I'm

264
00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:31.830
doing that. I hit sign
in and I'm now in

265
00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:35.220
the back. I just now
just been redirected to my

266
00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:37.110
open ID and I look
in my Earl and there's

267
00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:39.800
a shared secret. It's a
big, long, complicated thing. And

268
00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:43.140
it looks like a typical,
typical, you know, passport or

269
00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:46.260
Google accounts, kind of really
complicated URL thing that's been

270
00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.590
passed in. And it says
you must log in to

271
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:53.000
authenticate as Scott Hanselman. So
my open ID, this free

272
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.130
open ID server, you can
go and get one of

273
00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:59.800
these yourself. So yeah, that's
the missing thing is somewhere

274
00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:02.740
you have to put in
a password, right? So now

275
00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:05.620
if you look at my
URL, I'm on a secure

276
00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:09.820
site for open ID on
my open id.com. And again,

277
00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:11.890
there will be many, and
there are many open ID

278
00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:14.710
servers. My open ID is
just the one that everyone's

279
00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:16.870
using right now. So I
logged in and says, all

280
00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:22.450
right, it says the site
identifying itself as giant.com has

281
00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:25.600
asked us for confirmation that
this is your identity. Earl.

282
00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:27.610
I have the choice. And
this is actually just in

283
00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:32.320
HTML on the, my open
ID site allow forever allow

284
00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:35.410
once or deny. Okay. I'm
just going to say, allow,

285
00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:38.590
once now I'm looking at
now, I've been redirected back

286
00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:40.900
to jet.com and they've negotiated
back and forth. And it

287
00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:45.520
says, hello, hanselman.com. Cause that's
all it knows about me,

288
00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:49.210
But, and this is a
good segue to this. Obviously

289
00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:52.390
you can store more than
just your identity, your password.

290
00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:55.060
You can store pieces that
you're addressing your, all that

291
00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:57.190
other stuff that you like
to fill in. When you

292
00:15:57.190 --> 00:16:00.670
order stuff from Amazon, Does
he have what's called personas?

293
00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:02.050
And this is one of
the neat thing. You can

294
00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:04.690
have multiple personas. And this
is really up to the

295
00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:07.720
implementation of the open ID
server. So on the, my

296
00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:09.370
open ID side, I can
go in and I can

297
00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:12.820
say, here's my default persona.
And then I could say,

298
00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:16.660
but this is different from
my public persona, right? I

299
00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:18.190
might want to, I mean,
if I'm a person, if

300
00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:20.200
you, maybe you just want
to be Carl F and

301
00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:22.660
you don't want to spread
yourself around as Carl Franklin, you

302
00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:25.510
could do that. You could
have, you could basically have

303
00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:28.360
multiple personalities and sign in
for some things as one

304
00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:31.150
person and other things as
another. And then you can

305
00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:33.970
go back to the open
ID site and see I'm

306
00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:36.760
clicking on sites. And I
can see the 12 open

307
00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:41.230
ID sites that I have
trusted. I can see how

308
00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:44.800
many times that I've approved
that site and I can

309
00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:47.980
also deny them. So I
could actually go back and

310
00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:50.770
say, well, I'm not going
to allow giant.com. I'm going

311
00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:54.220
to remove that from the
list now. So I have

312
00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:56.680
a complete list. And then
it says, if I want

313
00:16:56.680 --> 00:17:01.360
to allow them explicitly, they
actually won't prompt me if

314
00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:03.460
I'm already logged in. And
they won't, they'll automatically send

315
00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:06.580
confirmation of my identity to
these sites. So it really

316
00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:11.050
puts you into control. It's
a lot like what, what

317
00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:13.720
card space intended to do
in tends to do, but

318
00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:15.940
it's all done in the
browser. It doesn't have anything

319
00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:21.700
to do with any kind
of client side stuff. So

320
00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:25.090
of course, as such and
not requiring any JavaScript or

321
00:17:25.090 --> 00:17:27.400
anything, it's very friendly. If
someone wanted to do Ajax

322
00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:30.490
implementations of signing and stuff,
it's really, it doesn't care.

323
00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:32.680
It's very open in the
way that it does things.

324
00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:36.100
Yeah. And I, you know,
I can't help, but my

325
00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:39.490
mind is wondering too, you
know, how can this work

326
00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:42.820
for not just a web
identity, but for, you know,

327
00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:45.670
spam and phishing and all
of those other kinds of

328
00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:49.860
things. How, how does it
apply to those problems? Okay,

329
00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:54.630
well, Spam is a larger,
a larger problem, but there's

330
00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:57.360
a thing called an XR
eye, which is a new

331
00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:01.590
kind of internet identifier. And
XRY as an extensible resource

332
00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:06.690
identifier and UN UN UN
I name an I name

333
00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:08.910
is something that is a,
is a kind of a,

334
00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:11.340
an Sri, like if you
go to my blog and

335
00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:14.160
you underneath my face, it
says, contact me. And it

336
00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:20.190
says equals Scott dot Hanselman.
So equals Scott Hanselman is

337
00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:25.410
my name. It's a unique
identifier that represents me. And

338
00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:28.380
in the next unique to
what the world in unique

339
00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:32.480
to the universe. Exactly. Okay.
You think you're the only

340
00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:35.540
Scott Hanselman in the world?
No, no, there are I

341
00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:38.630
names and then there are
there are I number? So

342
00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:41.330
my guess my, my flip
question there gets to the

343
00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:44.300
question, the real question is,
you know, who, how do

344
00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:47.270
you pick one without making
sure, you know, while making

345
00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:50.480
sure it's unique? Well, they
handle the uniqueness, but I

346
00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:52.700
mean, a good question is,
am I the only person

347
00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:55.610
that has hanselman.com? Yes, yes.
Does that suck for the

348
00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:58.340
other Hanselman's in the world?
Yes, it does. You know,

349
00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:02.000
I give them email if
they want, Did something validate

350
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.300
the fact that, that it
was available In this case,

351
00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:08.360
the, the, the people at
the I name provider in

352
00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:10.370
this case, just like, just
like when you decide to

353
00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:14.120
get a, you there's a
directory, right. Does your username

354
00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:17.750
on a particular site? Okay,
I get it. Okay. So

355
00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:23.450
That these, in this case,
<inaudible> are also backward compatible

356
00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:28.130
with IP addresses and DNS,
DNS addressing rather. So you

357
00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:31.160
could actually use your IP
address as your I name,

358
00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:33.200
I don't need. So what
I'm saying, so if you,

359
00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:35.240
if you don't want to,
I could just use hanselman.com

360
00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:38.390
and that could be my,
my XRY as well. Now

361
00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:41.030
you can use your, I
name as an open ID

362
00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:44.840
identifier, and then they'll automatically
do, do re resolution of

363
00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:46.990
that. This is going to
be an open ID version

364
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.850
too. Although there are a
few implementations of one, one

365
00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:52.010
that'll do this. So this
will mean that if I'm

366
00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:55.920
not necessarily an individual who
wants to have a, a,

367
00:19:56.210 --> 00:19:58.250
a website, or I don't
want to use my website

368
00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:01.850
as my, my identifier, for
some reason, I could use

369
00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:06.980
an XR. I, now I
got my, my name from

370
00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:12.410
a company called two IDI
to IDI the number two

371
00:20:12.410 --> 00:20:16.790
idi.com. And I use this
to prevent spam because it

372
00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:19.550
basically gives me a form
that people can have to

373
00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:23.090
fill out rather than emailing
me. And it proves that

374
00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:25.040
they are a person by
doing the whole, send them

375
00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:26.540
an email, and then they
have to click on a

376
00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:29.990
link. And it identifies their,
at least if they're not,

377
00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:31.820
if they are a bot,
there are clever enough bot

378
00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:33.830
that could actually do all
that work for me. I

379
00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:37.100
haven't gotten any spam through
it, through it yet. So

380
00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:39.260
the point is though that
they're trying to have ways

381
00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:42.890
for people to have these
unique identifiers. And yes, there

382
00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:44.810
are more than one Scott
Hanselman. So there's no PR

383
00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:49.150
no way to solve that
problem. But, you know, I

384
00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:51.400
am the only in this
case person with hanselman.com and

385
00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.560
the only person with that
equals Scott that Hanford. So

386
00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:57.010
those can be used as
my identifiers so that I

387
00:20:57.010 --> 00:20:59.100
don't have to go and
pick a username and all

388
00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:03.040
these different places, you know,
theoretically ever again. Right. Okay.

389
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.700
Now on the, on the,
how do I identify myself

390
00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:10.870
back to the, the open
ID server? That's really up

391
00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:13.420
to that implementation of the
server. And again, the open

392
00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:15.640
ID spec doesn't necessarily say
that it has to be

393
00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:21.640
a password. So what they've
announced is a cooperation between

394
00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:25.510
the card space team and
the open ID kind of

395
00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:27.970
group of people. Cause it's
many, many people working on

396
00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:29.930
this kind of thing I
was going to say, Yeah,

397
00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:32.730
I mean, card space overlaps
a little bit in, in

398
00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:36.060
car, in, in open ID,
does it not? Yeah, there

399
00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:38.940
I been cards open ID
could sit by itself, but

400
00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:40.650
there are some concern that
you could do a fishing

401
00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:47.550
attack by faking out a,
an open ID provider. So

402
00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:50.070
they could redirect me to
a bad guy. And then

403
00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:54.300
I might type my password
in right integrating card space.

404
00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:57.450
With open ID gives you
kind of the best of

405
00:21:57.450 --> 00:22:00.090
both worlds. You get the,
you get the card space,

406
00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:03.210
UI, the flexibility of, of
being able to export your

407
00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:07.500
cards. It's more cryptographically significant
on the client side. Future

408
00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:10.290
versions of card space will
include things like smart cards

409
00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:16.500
and, you know, rotating tokens
and stuff. But open ID

410
00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:18.690
is flexible enough that people
will be able to use

411
00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:21.240
it. And then won't may
not necessarily have card space

412
00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:26.100
on their system. So by
them collaborating, it allows identity

413
00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:30.900
kind of identity 2.0 to
happen, regardless. Yes, card space

414
00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:33.930
is a brilliant idea, but
to be clear, card space

415
00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:38.790
is just an implementation of
this concept called information cards.

416
00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:42.690
And they're, you know, there
will be many implementations card

417
00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:44.640
space will just be the
one that's the most ubiquitous.

418
00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:47.250
So tell us a little
bit about, again, about this

419
00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:50.450
announcement that bill Gates made
at the RSA conference about

420
00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:55.830
supporting open ID, Right? So
it's a big conference that's

421
00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:57.840
going on actually right now,
I think it will be

422
00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:01.410
done Friday in San Francisco.
And we've actually got some

423
00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:04.560
people down there working in
the Microsoft booth. Stuart Solera

424
00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:07.740
is down there given demos
on how to do card

425
00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:09.900
space banking integration, which is
something that we do with

426
00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:14.550
Kirlian. I was about 15,000
people down there and they

427
00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:19.560
basically announced a partnership between
Microsoft companies like Jan rain,

428
00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:23.610
skip and Verisign to integrate
an op inter-operate between card

429
00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:27.720
space and open ID. Okay.
Wow. That's huge. It is

430
00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:29.880
huge. And it's, it's huge
because it shows that this

431
00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:31.680
is such a big problem.
There's really not as much

432
00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:34.410
time for bickering as there
was in the past. And

433
00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:37.350
I think that Microsoft is
starting to recognize when a

434
00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:41.400
good idea happens and it's
not Microsoft's idea that they

435
00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:43.590
should still get excited about
it and get behind it.

436
00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:46.970
And when it is a
good idea. Yeah. So Microsoft

437
00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:51.290
obviously recognizes that open ID
is going to be huge.

438
00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:53.960
And Kim Cameron is very
pragmatic, right? He's the chief

439
00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:57.260
architect of identity, right? So
they're going to work with

440
00:23:57.260 --> 00:24:01.610
the community and integrate open
ID support in, in any

441
00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:04.550
of the Microsoft identity server
products. And they're going to

442
00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:06.950
make it a, make a,
what's called an information using

443
00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:11.360
information cards with open ID
profile. So if I wanted

444
00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:13.760
to make a website, I
really want it to support,

445
00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:16.430
you know, either of these
options. I want someone to

446
00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:17.930
come to my site and
be able to log in

447
00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:21.350
with an open ID with
an X, with a, an

448
00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:23.300
Sri, with a card space.
I want it to just,

449
00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:26.480
I want it to just
work. Yeah. I don't want

450
00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:28.250
to go and how, I
don't want to store passwords

451
00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:30.200
on my, on my site.
I mean, imagine, think about

452
00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:31.610
that. You want to sit
down tomorrow and make a

453
00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:35.180
site to log in first,
the okay. Username, password, these

454
00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:36.980
aren't things that we really
want to be in the

455
00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:39.830
business of doing right. I
want to store a unique

456
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:42.740
identifier for this individual. I
might want to ask him

457
00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:46.400
for information about himself, like
his name and his, his

458
00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:49.160
first name, his last name
and his email address. And

459
00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:51.830
I want to be able
to retrieve that in such

460
00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:54.560
a way that it is
secure and I'm not gonna

461
00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:57.110
necessarily store his secrets. Now
it's a couple of different

462
00:24:57.110 --> 00:25:00.830
things there. Each time he
logs in, I can retrieve

463
00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:03.230
those claims, those bits of
information, like his, his first

464
00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:06.050
name and his last name
from the identity provider. So

465
00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:08.180
I don't even technically have
to store his first name

466
00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:10.250
and last name if I
don't want to. Right. Cause

467
00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:12.890
that's, that's a claim about
who he is. Right. I

468
00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:15.760
can store this unique identifier
at all. It takes the

469
00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:18.550
heat off of you as
a, as a website owner.

470
00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:23.890
You know who, who right
now currently is storing personal

471
00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:28.300
information and your database, you
know, you're, you're liable for

472
00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:32.710
that information if it gets
out Right. Exactly. Now of

473
00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:35.020
course, having it centralized like
this, of course, there's all

474
00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:37.360
sorts of anti-phishing things that
they can go on. They

475
00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:39.310
can go and add like
this, you know, safe sign

476
00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:41.650
in where you could have
them show a picture picture

477
00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:44.890
of yourself. So if you
visited a site and somehow

478
00:25:44.890 --> 00:25:46.840
you got fished and you
didn't see that picture of

479
00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:49.990
yourself, and you might say,
Oh wow, I'm possibly getting

480
00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:53.230
phished. People are also talking
about creating a white list.

481
00:25:53.710 --> 00:25:56.110
So I could go. And
rather than if someone stole

482
00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:59.200
some information and somehow was
able to start pretending to

483
00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:01.900
be me, I could go
and say, I'm only going

484
00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:06.310
to share my information with
these sites, blacklist everybody else.

485
00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:09.700
Well, don't you do That
every time, anytime you log

486
00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:12.960
in don't don't you don't
you do that. I mean,

487
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.370
the provider should have a
list of the sites that

488
00:26:15.370 --> 00:26:17.740
you've logged into. Yeah. They
do have a site, but

489
00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:21.160
right now they'll, they'll prompt
you. If you want to,

490
00:26:22.030 --> 00:26:24.580
they'll say this new site
is designed to ask you

491
00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:27.130
about, about something about yourself.
Do you want to allow

492
00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:29.530
that? And you can allow
or disallow w with a

493
00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:33.160
white list. You'd actually just
automatically disallow. I see. Now

494
00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:35.860
there's also some cool stuff
going on. All the different

495
00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:38.710
web 2.0 companies are getting
behind this. Like, have you

496
00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:42.940
ever done claiming your blog
on Technorati? You know, I,

497
00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:45.780
at that, and it Looked
a little bit complex and

498
00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:50.000
I just said, nah, Yeah.
So you're also claiming, claiming

499
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.280
your blog Technorati is a,
is a website that keeps

500
00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:54.530
track of all the technical
folks that are blogging. And

501
00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:57.170
it's like a Google search
for blogs. Yeah. And it

502
00:26:57.170 --> 00:26:59.690
also keeps track of the
interrelationships between those things. Right.

503
00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:02.480
And when you make a
profile on Technorati, you have

504
00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:05.720
to claim your blog. Basically,
they, they need you to

505
00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:09.140
put a little bit of
HTML in your blog, so

506
00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:12.140
then they can visit it
and prove that you are

507
00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:14.380
the guy who really owns
that Earl. Right. So, so

508
00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:17.540
I, so someone else can't
go on claim, hanselman.com, they're

509
00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:21.560
integrating open ID services. So
you'll be able to claim

510
00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:24.080
your blog by giving your
open ID. Cause if you

511
00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:26.810
could log in, then obviously
you own that. You own

512
00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:29.570
that, or what Benefit. And
it's a side tangent. I

513
00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:31.850
know, but what's the benefit
of claiming your blog for

514
00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:35.420
Technorati. Oh, that's yeah. That's
totally a tangent. It just

515
00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:38.000
allows you to put picture,
you know, put a picture

516
00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.430
up and say that this
is my blog, go in

517
00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:43.840
and manage your ranking and
different stuff like that. I

518
00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:46.370
don't pay any attention to
that to Technorati. But my

519
00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:48.230
point was that this is
an example of a web

520
00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:52.400
2.0 company who had an
existing concept of identity. And

521
00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:56.630
they, they, they wanted to
prove that someone owned something

522
00:27:57.170 --> 00:27:59.240
and raw and they invented
a way to do it.

523
00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:01.640
I hear it puts some
HTML on your blog and

524
00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:03.620
we'll trust that it's really,
you like go make a

525
00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:06.350
post, put the word poop
in it, and then, Hey,

526
00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:08.030
look, he posted, so you
must own the blog, right?

527
00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:10.670
That was a weird little
dance that you had to

528
00:28:10.670 --> 00:28:13.490
do with this particular web
2.0 company. But with open

529
00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:16.550
ID that had an identity
solution, that was just obvious.

530
00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:18.440
So it makes a lot
of sense that they would

531
00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:21.350
just say, Oh, we'll, we'll
use open ID. That's, that's

532
00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:25.100
exactly the problem that we're
trying to solve. So there's

533
00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:27.380
a really great screencast. I
know this is a really

534
00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:30.050
not a very easy thing
to talk about when you're

535
00:28:30.050 --> 00:28:33.680
doing it over audio. Like
we are Simon will, Wilson

536
00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:37.220
has got a, a great
screencast that is up at

537
00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:40.700
shrink stir slash L U
three. If you look at

538
00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:43.580
one link and this whole
show, just go to shrink,

539
00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:47.120
stir slash L U three,
because it explains to you

540
00:28:47.270 --> 00:28:50.150
how to use open ID.
And then he has a

541
00:28:50.150 --> 00:28:52.550
link there called how to
turn your blog into an

542
00:28:52.550 --> 00:28:54.800
open ID. So I think
that the kind of the

543
00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:57.710
call to action for everyone
is to go add these

544
00:28:57.710 --> 00:29:00.440
two lines of code to
your blog, sign up with

545
00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:04.250
a, my open id.com and
then turn your blog into

546
00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:05.810
an open idea and then
kind of take a look

547
00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:10.220
around practice logging in, and
then we'll maybe we'll do

548
00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:12.950
a show about how to
actually integrate with open ID.

549
00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:15.110
Cause there's a lot of
really interesting things going on

550
00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:18.890
around that. For example, a
company has, has made a

551
00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:22.730
plugin to a patchy that
basically it's like, you know

552
00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:28.280
how in, in IIS, we've
got forms, authentication and basic

553
00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:30.830
auth and windows integrated off.
Yeah. They made a module

554
00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:34.130
for Apache that just boom,
poof, it's automatically open ID.

555
00:29:35.450 --> 00:29:38.900
So I might, I, I
always do this. I think

556
00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:40.340
that I'll go, I'll get
the time to do that.

557
00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:42.850
I'll write an HTTP module,
a forms, auth module for

558
00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:46.690
open ID. Yeah. So I'll
declare here that I'll try.

559
00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:49.180
And then probably two days
from now someone smarter than

560
00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:51.270
me will have already pulled
it up. That's the way

561
00:29:51.270 --> 00:29:53.880
it goes though, You know,
creating something like that, like

562
00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:57.450
an authentication module for, for
open ID would pretty be

563
00:29:57.450 --> 00:30:00.000
pretty awesome. And that's the
kind of, of integration I

564
00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.580
think we're going to see.
So the Apache guys have

565
00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:05.520
already got that plugable auth
module. It makes it really,

566
00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:09.900
really easy. We've we're adding
it to DAS blog. I

567
00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:12.150
talked to a couple of
guys that have said, yeah,

568
00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:13.710
when I get time, I'll
get around to doing it.

569
00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:17.580
You know, Kevin Hammond already did
the integration with, with card

570
00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:20.730
space for DAS blog. So
I think more and more,

571
00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:22.590
you're going to see at
the very least in the,

572
00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:24.000
in the short term, this
will be a great way

573
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.620
to, to associate your identity
with an open ID for

574
00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:31.110
the purpose of leading a
blog comment. Right. That's the

575
00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:33.600
obvious thing, right? Yeah. Have
you ever gone to a

576
00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:36.300
blog and wanted to leave
a comment? And then they

577
00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:39.300
said, Oh, go ahead and
log in. No, I'll go

578
00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:42.450
ahead and make a new
trend. Make a new ID.

579
00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:47.070
No, like Rory, his blog
did this. No, I don't

580
00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:50.040
remember that. No, I know
that they use the chop

581
00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:53.820
scar or whatever the heck
gets called capture capture. Yeah.

582
00:30:53.910 --> 00:30:56.010
Yeah. There's been a couple
of times in the last

583
00:30:56.010 --> 00:30:58.530
week where I've really wanted
to leave a comment somewhere

584
00:30:59.310 --> 00:31:02.970
and gadget is another example
and gadgets blog, and then

585
00:31:02.970 --> 00:31:04.920
they want me, they want
me to create a profile.

586
00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:07.140
I'm not going to, you
know, there's, there's a limit

587
00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:08.640
to the kind of site
that I'm going to go

588
00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:11.010
and create a profile on.
And I'm certainly not going

589
00:31:11.010 --> 00:31:14.610
to Some of those bigger,
bigger sites I've I've had

590
00:31:14.730 --> 00:31:16.920
that experience. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
So like for example, I

591
00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:20.520
just I'm logging into a
WordPress blog. WordPress is a

592
00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:23.250
real popular blog system and
it says, well, you can

593
00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:25.800
log in as a WordPress
user with your username or

594
00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:29.940
password or your open ID
identity. So then I'm getting

595
00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:33.210
to my open ID side
again, and it actually says

596
00:31:33.210 --> 00:31:36.180
select a persona. And then
it's saying they would like

597
00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:39.330
to know my nickname and
my full name and my

598
00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:44.400
email address. At this point,
I could just decide to

599
00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:45.840
deny and say, I'm not
going to give them this

600
00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:49.140
access, but they've actually said,
well, your nickname we'd like

601
00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:52.350
that, but your full name
is optional. It's like, well,

602
00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:54.060
that's cool. So I don't
know. I'm only going to

603
00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:55.770
give them my email address
and I'm only going to

604
00:31:55.770 --> 00:31:58.980
allow it once. And now
I'm logged into this WordPress

605
00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:02.010
blog and really puts people
in control of their stuff.

606
00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:05.130
Control of their identity. It's
actually makes me want to

607
00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:07.200
run around to a bunch
of different websites and just

608
00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:11.550
delete my information. Yeah. I
mean, start, start cleaning up

609
00:32:11.550 --> 00:32:14.760
your, your, your identity online.
Cause you know, I've got

610
00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:18.540
so many different accounts, probably
50 or 60. I mean

611
00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:20.550
just of all the different
places that you've ever visited.

612
00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:23.910
There is a benefit to
having all those accounts and

613
00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:27.090
all those passwords in that
is if one of them

614
00:32:27.090 --> 00:32:31.500
gets compromised, the rest don't
get compromised. Yeah. Having, having

615
00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:36.120
anything in one place is
that that much more has

616
00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:39.030
to be that much more
secure in order for the

617
00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:42.140
not to fall on Your
head. Well, there's a lot

618
00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:44.960
of really good resources out
there. Just search for open

619
00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:48.260
ID on Google with, with
one word, open ideas, one

620
00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:50.660
word we've put a collection
of links up on the

621
00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:55.490
site. There's some really good
PHP libraries for open ID.

622
00:32:55.670 --> 00:32:59.540
Open id.net, I believe is
the one of the home

623
00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:04.340
bases for open ID. And
there's a couple of.net libraries

624
00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:07.940
as well. I haven't personally
looked, looked at them. Although

625
00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:11.750
one person has created a,
a guy named Andrew are

626
00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:14.510
not, I didn't put this
link up, has created an

627
00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:18.200
open ID control. So it's
just a drop the control

628
00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:20.900
on the page. And it
enables that for open ID.

629
00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:24.530
Oh wow. So I haven't
looked at that control personally.

630
00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:27.440
There's Ruby implementations of this.
We'll add a link to

631
00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:31.220
it anyway. Yeah. We'll add
a link. So there's, there's

632
00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:32.900
lots of different ways to
get involved in this. And

633
00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:34.400
I think that we're going
to see it becoming easier

634
00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:38.330
and easier. Now a control
on informing asp.net perspective is

635
00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:41.030
definitely maybe a little different
than I would. I do

636
00:33:41.030 --> 00:33:43.880
things I may might want
an HTTP module, but if

637
00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:48.080
you go up to open
ID enabled.com, that is kind

638
00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:51.860
of the, all things open
ID. You can get python.net

639
00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:56.780
libraries. the.net version is just
a port of the, of

640
00:33:56.780 --> 00:33:59.510
the open ID stuff. All
right, Scott. Well, that's a

641
00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:02.390
show. It's been a good
one. I can't wait to

642
00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:04.760
dive into open ID a
little bit more. Thanks for

643
00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:07.910
wedding our appetite as always.
Thank you. All right. We'll

644
00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:09.620
see you next week on
handsome.
