8
00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.630
It's Hansel minutes, all weekly
discussion with web developer and

9
00:00:53.630 --> 00:01:00.020
technologist Scott Hanselman. This is
Lawrence Ryan announcing show number 529.

10
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.980
In this episode, Scott talks
with tinsel, founder and CEO,

11
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:12.320
Nia Williams about bootstrapping a
hardware startup. Hi, this is

12
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.290
Scott Hanselman. This is another
episode of Hansel minutes today.

13
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.690
We're talking with Neil Williams,
who is the founder and

14
00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.880
CEO of tinsel. And you've
got a successful hardware startup.

15
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.260
Yes. Well, it's funny to
say the word successful. I

16
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.340
will I'll call it successful.
Let's see. Once we start

17
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.310
shipping product, then I will
say it's successful. That's a

18
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.010
good point. Yeah, there's a
lot of, there's a lot

19
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.800
of press when, when cool
heart part where things come

20
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.260
out. So when you see
someone's face in the news,

21
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.320
you think, Oh, they're so
successful, but you're right until

22
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.960
all the customers are happy.
That's when success really starts.

23
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.370
Doesn't it? Exactly. So at
this point, you're estimating it.

24
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.340
You're going to deliver somewhere
in a, in the middle

25
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.610
of the year here. Yeah.
At this point it's looking

26
00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.490
like potentially may June, we
just got an update from

27
00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.810
the factory yesterday and we're
having some, some fun times

28
00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.820
with lading where we are.
We're trying to really nail

29
00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.580
the color, finishes the way
that we want them to

30
00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.900
be. And so there's some
fun things that have happened

31
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.470
where we got them pretty
solid when we did the

32
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.390
prototyping, but the material composition
was a little different because

33
00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.120
the process that they make
the prototypes with is different

34
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.370
than they do when they're
making it at scale. And

35
00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.370
so now we have to
kind of, kind of realign

36
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.670
the coloring with the new
ones. So that's, that's a

37
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.300
fun, a fun one. Okay.
Very cool. So let's back

38
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.030
up and let's talk about
what the vision is and

39
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.300
what the product is. What
did you create? Yeah. Yes.

40
00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.770
So Tencel, our first product
that we're we're bringing to

41
00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.310
market is an audio necklace
as we like to call

42
00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.750
it, which is a necklace
that has the functionality of

43
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.440
headphones built into it. So
all of the details of

44
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.160
the electronics are embedded within
the details of the jewelry.

45
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.440
Hmm. So that seems like
something that people would have

46
00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.110
done before, but I can't
think of anywhere I've seen

47
00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.580
this before. Well, it's funny
because when, when the whole

48
00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.940
thing started, it really was
this, this pain point that

49
00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.180
I had, I used my
headphones every day, but they're

50
00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.510
buried at the bottom of
a bag. They get broken,

51
00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.630
they get lost. My husband
takes them. It's, it's a

52
00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.590
vicious cycle. So I figured
that this had to have

53
00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.110
been a solved problem that,
you know, I wanted to

54
00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.360
be able to wear them
on my body to avoid

55
00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.440
some of these issues, but
you know, not having them

56
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.190
look like headphones. And so
I was looking all over

57
00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.670
for this product that I
felt had to exist somewhere.

58
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.450
And, and it didn't. So
then eventually I kind of

59
00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.400
got this bug thinking that
maybe I could be the

60
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.520
person to make this product.
And that's, that's how it

61
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.760
all started the Genesis. That's
funny how that works on

62
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.620
the internet. You know, you
think to yourself, it's so

63
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.870
big and there's so many
people out there, it must

64
00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.380
already exist. And when it
doesn't exist, you still can't

65
00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:18.720
believe it. Exactly. It's, it's
amazing. So this is a

66
00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.870
piece of jewelry that it
goes around your neck and

67
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.980
it is indistinguishable from any
other piece of attractive well-made

68
00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.610
jewelry. Right. It doesn't look
like headphones. Exactly. It looks

69
00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.790
like a necklace. And then
when you were ready to

70
00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.690
use it as headphones, you
basically can transform it into,

71
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.230
into your headphones while still
wearing it. And you said

72
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.130
that there's electronics involved. How
much, how much smarts to

73
00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.370
this does this headphone have?
Yeah. So I guess if,

74
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.480
depending on how you qualify
something as, as being smart,

75
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.680
it's actually quite dumb in
the sense that there's no,

76
00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.480
there's no chips in it,
actually. That's not totally true.

77
00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.300
There's, there's a remote part
that's in there so that

78
00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.200
it can control the yeah,
exactly. But in the sense

79
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.960
of, you know, something that
needs to be charged, it's

80
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.960
not, and that was very
much intentional on our part.

81
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.100
So just as you think
of the headphones that most

82
00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.180
people have are wired headphones
that you just plug into

83
00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.860
that, that 3.5 millimeter plug
on your phone. This is

84
00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:30.060
how tensile works as well.
So smart in terms of

85
00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.240
the innovative design, but we
really tried to keep it

86
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.680
as simple as possible from
a technology standpoint, because it

87
00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.400
allowed us to, you know,
execute more quickly, but also

88
00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.450
avoid some of the issues
that other wearable devices have

89
00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:50.010
with, with power and charging.
Hm. And when you decided

90
00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.140
to do this, did you
think it would be something

91
00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.480
that would be straightforward or
did it feel to you

92
00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.860
like this was a, a
big task, like when I

93
00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.230
think of like prototyping and
manufacturing, I don't have any

94
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:02.420
sense of what scope is.
I don't know if it's

95
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.850
a company or if it's
a hobby or if it's

96
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:07.340
a lifestyle brand. I mean,
how do you size something

97
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:11.530
like that? Yeah. That is
a really great question. Cause

98
00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:14.770
it makes me think that
like when I first started,

99
00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:18.190
I didn't even know if
it was possible to make

100
00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:22.450
this, like, if it was
actually possible, because like I

101
00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:25.360
said, I thought it was
obvious someone would have solved

102
00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.700
this problem. And then when
I realized that no one

103
00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.940
had, then I started to
think before I thought, Oh,

104
00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.370
this is a great opportunity.
I was thinking like, is

105
00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:36.550
it possible? Like maybe this
hasn't been done because it's

106
00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:40.510
not possible. And then, you
know, we were fortunate to

107
00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:43.570
get connected with the team
that we're working with on

108
00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:48.880
the product. Linda Rose who's led
our product development has, you

109
00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.420
know, over a decade of
experience making consumer electronics. And

110
00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:56.230
so if it weren't for
her, that could kind of

111
00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:59.890
help us figure out, okay,
we will connect you to

112
00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:03.970
the factories that make these
kinds of products. And none

113
00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:06.250
of them have ever made
this before. So it's been

114
00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:10.360
a journey, not only for
me who was new to

115
00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.570
the world of manufacturing, but
even for people who have

116
00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:17.770
been veterans in this space
and manufacture goods, we all

117
00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:20.830
have been, you know, troubleshooting
and figuring out the answers

118
00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:23.920
to these as we go
along, which is exciting. But

119
00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:26.380
also, you know, when you
hit a snag, there's really

120
00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:33.400
no conventional answer to that
problem. Right. Right. And when

121
00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.940
you're making something that is
both a piece of electronics

122
00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:39.820
and a piece of jewelry,
I would say with the

123
00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:43.100
advent of the iPhone, there's
been an expectation of, of

124
00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:46.570
heft and quality and people
pick an item up an

125
00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:48.760
object, and now you've got
one that has to be

126
00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:52.390
both, both things and good
at both things. And people

127
00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:55.120
expect, it needs to feel,
you know, like feel like

128
00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:58.750
quality or they'll dismiss it.
Yes. There's, there's a lot

129
00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:02.620
of blood, sweat and tears
that goes into a well

130
00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:09.130
designed well functioning product. And
we have done a lot

131
00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:12.430
of work on this and,
you know, even, even now

132
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:16.660
testing it and doing all
of those things, we still

133
00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:18.970
have so many assumptions. There's
so much that you just

134
00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:21.490
really won't know until it's
out in the wild. Right.

135
00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:25.930
And so that, that all
terrifies me. It just a

136
00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:28.390
little bit, but, you know,
I just keep trying to

137
00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:32.350
think of every possible use
case and, and how we

138
00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:36.550
can try to try to
do that. So anyway, I,

139
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.360
I think that the, the
design aspects of it and

140
00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:44.020
kind of how that comes
together with the technology and,

141
00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:47.500
you know, the, the facets
of what you can and

142
00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:51.910
can't do with manufacturing are
constantly being navigated and kind

143
00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:56.340
of, what's the word like
in balance, like you're constantly

144
00:08:56.340 --> 00:09:01.370
trying to balance those things.
And what is your background?

145
00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:04.550
One in, in creation of,
of technical pieces of hardware?

146
00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:10.580
No, actually it's not, but
I, what I like to

147
00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:13.580
say is that I am
a creator. I love to

148
00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:17.030
create things. I love to,
you know, make things from

149
00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:20.510
scratch. I have a lot
of hobbies and I just

150
00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:24.560
really have always gotten a
lot of gratification out of

151
00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:27.560
being able to build things,
physical things, but also, you

152
00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:30.620
know, in, from like more
of a concept type of

153
00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:33.470
view, just getting in there
and figuring out the answers

154
00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:35.990
to problems and being able
to create a solution for

155
00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:40.580
that. And so, but in
terms of where the expertise

156
00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:44.120
comes in on the manufacturing
and technical side, that is

157
00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:48.290
absolutely the team that we
are working with. Hmm. So

158
00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:50.000
would you say that when
people are, if people are

159
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.180
listening and they have an
idea and maybe they haven't

160
00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:55.520
gone out and made that
a reality because they thought,

161
00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:57.470
well, I don't know anything
about hardware. I don't know

162
00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:00.590
anything about software or whatever.
If they have that DNA,

163
00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:04.280
like you just described that
maker DNA, then there's no

164
00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:06.140
reason that they shouldn't go
in and make their vision

165
00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:09.590
a reality. Yeah. I think
that it's very possible. It

166
00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:12.230
really is because the thing
is, is none, none of

167
00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:18.380
these things can be adequately
built or created by just

168
00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:21.470
one person. Right. Even if
you did have the expertise

169
00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:24.530
and you knew everything that
you needed to do, actually,

170
00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:27.500
here's, here's an example because
this is like one facet

171
00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:31.910
of my business that, that
we worry about when you

172
00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:35.900
think about marketing. And I
have experience in marketing, I

173
00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:39.560
know a slew of things
that we should and need

174
00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:42.560
to be doing on the
marketing side, but I can't

175
00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:45.470
do them because I have
all of these other things

176
00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:48.440
that I have to do.
And like that take precedent

177
00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.900
are our priority over that.
And so, you know, we

178
00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:53.030
end up bringing on people
to kind of help with

179
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:56.330
that. Right. And you have
to, you know, vet them

180
00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:58.130
and hope that they have
the right experience and the

181
00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:01.730
right instinct really, to do,
to do well and to

182
00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:04.580
do the right things. But
again, so like, I would

183
00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:06.950
say that the it's the
collective team, like it all

184
00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:10.370
boils down to teams. For
sure. I think that there

185
00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:16.130
is a, there's a mythology
around creation of, of things.

186
00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:19.460
And people think that like,
you know, Steve jobs single-handedly

187
00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:22.520
put together your iPhone in
his garage, you realized there

188
00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:26.410
was no one else was
involved of course, but you,

189
00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:28.220
you really do need a
team. So this is, it

190
00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:32.510
sounds like an exercise in
delegation and oversight. Yes, yes,

191
00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:37.880
absolutely. That, and even in,
in delegation, but I would

192
00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:42.050
say like, probably, probably not
even to say in delegation

193
00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:44.180
for the most part, because
so much of it, like

194
00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:47.750
we rely on people to
just, like I said, kind

195
00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:49.940
of have the right instincts
and knowing that they have

196
00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:52.940
the experience to trust them,
that they can make the

197
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:57.160
decisions. I think that, you
know, we absolutely have conversations

198
00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:00.970
and meetings where we're regrouping
and going over the list

199
00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:03.100
of things that need to
be discussed and then figuring

200
00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:06.400
out what the next steps
are. But having a person

201
00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:09.880
who even can take all
of the issues and distill

202
00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:12.310
it into something that the
team can understand to make

203
00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:15.580
an informed decision that's important,
right. To even be able

204
00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:18.130
to do that. That's like
the basic thing you have

205
00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:20.850
to be able to have.
There's two things that I

206
00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:23.100
want to understand. Let's break
them down one at a

207
00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:25.620
time. First is how does
one put together the money

208
00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:27.900
for something like this? And
then this team that you're

209
00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:31.380
talking about, how do you,
how do you find them?

210
00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:35.550
So let's talk about, about
money. I see lots of

211
00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:39.720
people on Indiegogo and on
Kickstarter. And they pull down

212
00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:41.940
what appears to be large
amounts of money. And you

213
00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:45.420
think to yourself, wow, they
made $50,000. Like they're just

214
00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:48.330
rolling in the cash. Now
they're gonna make an amazing

215
00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:52.440
product. You had a successful
Indiegogo, but it's pretty clear

216
00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:54.840
from looking at your site
that that is not the

217
00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:59.430
backbone of what, what was
Right. No, that's, that's absolutely

218
00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:03.990
true. So there was money
that was involved that even

219
00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:08.490
needed to get us to
the Indiegogo campaign. And that

220
00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:13.410
was, you know, a couple
hundred thousand dollars to get

221
00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:18.720
from ideation to something that
was what you see when

222
00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:22.650
you look at our Indiegogo
campaign page and that's in,

223
00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:25.290
you know, the majority of
that going to product development.

224
00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:30.630
So, you know, manufacturing is
definitely an expensive proposition, like

225
00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:35.550
making a physical thing and
it's in part due to

226
00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:39.240
the cost of developing, you
know, a good product. But

227
00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:42.510
even when you're developing something
that is fairly low cost,

228
00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:45.240
which our product is not.
So you can kind of

229
00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:49.410
add maybe five or seven
times what the normal costs

230
00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:51.330
are for something. If you're
just making like, Oh, it's

231
00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:55.140
just a little plastic cup,
right? Like those things can

232
00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:58.560
even be something that can
be an expensive proposition because

233
00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:02.040
when you're not making something
to scale, you're basically paying

234
00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:06.480
upfront for the cost of
the time and using, you

235
00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:10.860
know, very heavy resources to
do a very small quantity

236
00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:14.900
or even just one of
a thing. And that is,

237
00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:19.290
is expensive. But then like
the other, the other alternative

238
00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:21.030
in terms of, and this
is kind of where we

239
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:23.010
sort of veered a little
bit off the course of

240
00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:27.240
what some hardware companies in
our position do is that

241
00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:29.520
you might, you know, build
the prototype in your home

242
00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:31.950
or in your garage or
what have you. And then

243
00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:34.500
once you get that nail,
do you take that to

244
00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:37.860
a manufacturer so that they
can produce that? But then

245
00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:41.070
one of the issues that
these companies frequently run into

246
00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:43.170
is that they find that
the thing they have is

247
00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:47.730
not manufacturable because it wasn't
made with the kinds of

248
00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:49.830
tools that are going to
be made when you're using

249
00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:52.490
and making it to scale.
But so, so either way

250
00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:55.310
it can become a inexpensive
proposition either on the front

251
00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:58.340
end or on the backend,
but to even get to

252
00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:02.060
the Indiegogo campaign or the
Kickstarter takes an investment of

253
00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:05.090
money. And then the money
that you raise, you're hoping

254
00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:06.980
is going to be the
money that will kind of

255
00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:09.170
help you cross the finish
line. But for us, you

256
00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:12.380
know, the goal was let's,
there were two, there were

257
00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:14.960
a couple goals, but one
of the goals was to,

258
00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:17.450
you know, get out there
and raise the funds that

259
00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:20.150
we needed to pay for
the tooling, because that was

260
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:23.480
one of the sort of
largest big chunk kind of

261
00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:26.690
costs that we had was,
you know, up until then

262
00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:30.380
we had been making these
prototypes with our factory partner,

263
00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:34.220
but those are largely made
by hand. And in order

264
00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:37.820
to make the pieces that,
you know, make this product

265
00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:41.480
at scale, you essentially need
to make those tools and

266
00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:45.020
those tools cost money to
make. So that was what

267
00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:46.760
we needed to make sure
we had the money to

268
00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:49.100
do, to even allow us
to be able to make

269
00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:51.680
large quantities of these instead
of making them one at

270
00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:55.490
a time. Right. And so
that was, that was what

271
00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:57.940
we were able to raise
with our Indiegogo. And then

272
00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:00.680
in addition to that, you
know, we wanted to get

273
00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:03.890
the feedback of, of the
world. This was kind of

274
00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:06.770
really our first foray out
there and sort of seeing,

275
00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:10.700
is there people that this
resonates with? I mean, we

276
00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:13.970
had felt so passionate. We
still feel so passionate about

277
00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:18.650
the fact that we need
to change this, this idea

278
00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:21.920
that, you know, making something
pink is what women want.

279
00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:25.310
And that's the version that,
that we need for consumer

280
00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:27.950
electronics. Like there's so much
more we can be doing

281
00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:32.450
to really have beautiful design
that people love and embrace

282
00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:35.570
because technology is everywhere. Now.
It's not just something that

283
00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:39.350
sits on the fringe of
society, where it's just, you

284
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:43.160
know, nerds and geeks that
care about that. It's everybody

285
00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:47.830
cares about technology now, Hey,
this is Scott. I wanted

286
00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:51.850
to tell you about LLB
Elgen pro the leading entity

287
00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:56.020
modeling designer for your favorite.net.
Oh, our mapping framework version

288
00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:58.990
five was just released with
some exciting new features like

289
00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:03.970
derived models, support for DTL
class models, document databases, real

290
00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:08.770
time validation, one-click relational model
synchronization, and much, much more.

291
00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:12.580
You can read all about
it. LL B L G

292
00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:17.440
E n.com. That's LLB elgin.com.
It's a fantastic product it's

293
00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:19.180
been around for years. And
you should check it out.

294
00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:23.770
L L B L Jen.
Yeah, it does seem like

295
00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:26.770
there is a certain kind
of inclusivity in technology right

296
00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:28.660
now. And I think kind
of it started with tablets

297
00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:31.210
and the idea that everyone
can be a nerd and

298
00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:32.530
it doesn't have to be
a nerd. Doesn't have to

299
00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:35.800
be a thing that excludes
it can be an inclusive,

300
00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:40.510
you know, enthusiasts are nerds,
nears are people who like

301
00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:46.090
nice things at work. Absolutely.
I think people embrace nerdiness

302
00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:49.590
a lot more now than,
you know, than we were

303
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:53.360
coming up in the world.
Yeah, definitely. One of the

304
00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:57.200
things that's really impressed me
about the whole, your whole,

305
00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:59.960
your whole kind of a
lifestyle brand here is that

306
00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:03.050
you're, you're so open about
the process on, on the

307
00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:05.420
tinsel blog at T I
N S E L dot

308
00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:08.870
M E you've got not
just, you know, a, Hey,

309
00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:11.030
here's the status of the
project, kind of a blog

310
00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:15.500
post, but it's like, here
are precise measurements of how

311
00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:17.630
it looked before and what
we changed and how it

312
00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:19.820
improved. And it was great.
You thought it was great

313
00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:23.570
before, but now it's 40%
thinner, you know, it's, it's

314
00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:27.800
really very transparent. You're giving
the right amount of detail

315
00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:31.790
that makes the customer feel
confident that things are moving

316
00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:36.620
forward. Yeah, it's really important
to, to me and to

317
00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:39.620
the rest of the team
that we try to share

318
00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:42.500
as much of the journey
as possible. And I don't

319
00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:44.780
know, I think it probably
stems from the fact that,

320
00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:46.940
you know, we kind of
feel like we're sort of

321
00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:50.720
the, the rag tag version
of, of a team that's

322
00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:53.750
bringing a product to life
like this. And, and to

323
00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:56.960
me, it's, it's a dream
to even be able to

324
00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:59.780
have the opportunity to work
on this and be doing

325
00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:02.810
this, and the fact that
we have done as much

326
00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:05.090
as we have, and sort
of, I guess, almost a

327
00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:08.060
year and a half that
I've been working on Tencel

328
00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:12.200
is incredible. And I really
want to, if nothing else

329
00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:15.020
sort of bring to light
to people that like, it's

330
00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:18.440
just a series of steps,
right. That get you from

331
00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:20.540
point a to point B,
not to say that any

332
00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:24.410
of those steps are easy,
but like you can, if

333
00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:26.510
you can put one foot
in front of the other,

334
00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:29.540
so to speak, then like
you can kind of try

335
00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:32.630
to build your dream. Right.
It's very much, like I

336
00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:35.480
said, dependent on having the
right people to help you

337
00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:38.060
do it. And that, you
know, in itself, we, we

338
00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:40.520
could unpack a little bit
more, I guess, but like,

339
00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:45.410
you know, somebody like me
who doesn't have experience in

340
00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:50.810
manufacturing or developing a tangible
good can, you know, go

341
00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:54.050
one day into a store
and see my product on

342
00:19:54.050 --> 00:19:56.450
the shelf. Like it's amazing.
And honestly, like the thing

343
00:19:56.450 --> 00:20:00.020
that is also interesting that
I think we overlook is

344
00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:02.300
that, you know, people do
this all the time, right?

345
00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:04.820
Like there's so many, I
mean, there's, there's, it tends

346
00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:07.580
to be in a different
kind of channel and universe.

347
00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:10.220
But if you think of
some of those things that

348
00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:12.620
come on at three o'clock
in the morning, these like

349
00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:16.460
as seen on TV, like,
Oh, you know, it'll like

350
00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:19.580
poach your eggs and also
make you waffles. Right. Like

351
00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:24.980
Somebody Funny, like me basically
kind of had a similar

352
00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:28.250
journey, right? Like it's not
like the, the, that person

353
00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:31.250
was just like, you know,
going to school and studying,

354
00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:33.890
you know, egg, poaching and
waffle making. But like they

355
00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:36.410
had an idea and they
were able to pull together

356
00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:38.960
the right resources to make
it happen. So I don't

357
00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:41.870
know. I want to try
to like, make it so

358
00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:44.150
that people understand that it's,
if you want to do

359
00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:46.190
this, there's a way you
can try to find a

360
00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:49.420
way to do this. Yeah.
It's too. It seems to

361
00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:52.600
me like, I'm hearing you
say that there's something to

362
00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:55.960
be said for simply not
stopping, like forward motion. Even

363
00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:58.960
the tiniest little iterations is
forward motion. And, and the

364
00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.360
difference between you and someone
who might be listening, who

365
00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:03.760
hasn't done, this is that
you simply have not given

366
00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:07.200
up and have no intention
of giving up. Yeah. And

367
00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:11.700
I will absolutely say that
it's not easy. You know,

368
00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:15.150
some of the challenges that,
that come your way, but

369
00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:17.820
I think that, you know,
the, the not giving up

370
00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:21.510
thing is critical. And, and
to, to say like, Oh,

371
00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:23.310
you don't give up, like,
I don't even want to

372
00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:25.710
play that down. Like, it's
like something that you just

373
00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:28.950
like, nothing gets to you,
or you never feel like

374
00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:33.030
down about how things are
going that day. I think

375
00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:36.810
that, you know, behind that
statement is a lot of,

376
00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:39.930
you know, things to take
your mind off of it.

377
00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:43.290
Being able to kind of
walk away from it, having

378
00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:46.740
some friends and hobbies and
things that you can kind

379
00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:50.010
of like, you know, resync
yourself and sort of recenter

380
00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:51.750
yourself because there's going to
be a lot of that

381
00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:54.510
needed when you hit a
wall. Cause you're going to

382
00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:56.310
hit lots of walls. It's
just like, are you going

383
00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:57.660
to let that stop you?
You're going to try to

384
00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:00.540
climb over it, you know?
Oh really? So you don't

385
00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:04.740
just float out of bed
on a rainbow. Oh, if

386
00:22:05.150 --> 00:22:09.540
only, you know, it's interesting
because from the outside, you

387
00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:13.410
know, we see successful Indiegogo.
We see successful Kickstarter. We,

388
00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:15.030
we, we go about our
lives and then a year

389
00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:17.760
later a product pops out
and notice. I remember I

390
00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:22.290
used, I saw the, the
bee sweet lemonade girl on

391
00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:24.870
TV and she gets $60,000.
I'm like, that's amazing. And

392
00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:27.030
then I go about my
business. And then a year

393
00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:29.490
later she's got a million
dollar deal with whole foods.

394
00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:33.180
And of course my mind
draws a line between point

395
00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:36.090
a, which was shark tank
and point B, which is

396
00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:39.300
million dollar deal. And now
she's like 11 and I'm

397
00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:43.500
completely yada, yada, yada, over
all of the actual hard

398
00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:45.450
work. You know, I have
no doubt that there's like

399
00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:47.550
a whole team there working
with her to make sure

400
00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:50.340
that that's successful now, but
it's so easy to downplay

401
00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:54.060
that hard work. Yeah. Yeah.
It's the, the highlights are

402
00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:58.530
very easy to highlight, but
it's, I think that most

403
00:22:58.530 --> 00:23:01.590
of the real work is
what happens in between those

404
00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:07.620
high points. So there's the
raising of the money, which

405
00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:12.270
is done in a varying
ways, Indiegogo or Kickstarter only

406
00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:13.980
being one of those. But
the other one that is

407
00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:17.910
interesting is, is access, access
to the right people. It

408
00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:20.820
sounds like you really cannot
sing the praises of your

409
00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:24.210
team enough for you you've
assembled a team, but you

410
00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:27.000
also somehow had access to
those people. How did that

411
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.790
come down? Yeah. So in
this, I feel like I

412
00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:35.130
will always be so incredibly
grateful for knowing the person

413
00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:37.500
who, without this, I feel
like I wouldn't have been

414
00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:39.630
able to start this. It
would have just been one

415
00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:42.150
of those. Yeah. That's a
cool idea. And then I

416
00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:44.760
would have like gone and,
you know, worked a regular

417
00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:46.700
job one day. Maybe I
would see it and be

418
00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:49.610
like, I had that idea.
Right. Like that happens to

419
00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:52.850
all of us. I think
the thing that, that made

420
00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:56.660
the difference was, was knowing
the right person. So it,

421
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:59.150
it started off like when
I first had the idea,

422
00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:01.850
the first thing that I
did was just try to

423
00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:04.220
thinking like, okay, I need
a designer who can help

424
00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:06.080
me, like take this out
of my head and like

425
00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:09.290
make it something visual. And
so I started contacting a

426
00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:13.190
bunch of designers that I
know, and then realizing that

427
00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:16.190
I needed an industrial designer
because like not all designers

428
00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:19.100
can design physical things. Like
that was the first thing,

429
00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:23.560
like first lesson. And then
like what happened was I

430
00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:27.100
ended up asking around if
people knew industrial designers. And

431
00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:30.430
one of the people that
I asked was Tom, Tom

432
00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:33.910
Cadas, who was the he's
the chairman of Voxer at

433
00:24:33.910 --> 00:24:35.730
the time, he was also
the CEO, but this is

434
00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:39.760
it's his company. He founded
it. And, you know, he

435
00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:43.600
had had some success before
starting that company, but I

436
00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:46.450
worked there for a few
years. And so Tom had

437
00:24:46.450 --> 00:24:49.180
gotten to know me really
well. We got to know

438
00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:51.760
each other really well. And
so, you know, I'm like,

439
00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:54.220
Tom knows people, let me
ask him if he knows

440
00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:58.000
any designers. And so that
was really the impetus really

441
00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:03.700
of, of everything because he
knew the person who's now

442
00:25:03.730 --> 00:25:06.850
our advisor, his name's ed
Kilduff and he is an

443
00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:09.280
industrial designer. That's done, you
know, a whole slew of

444
00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:13.630
things. But like, it seemed
like, okay, this, like, let

445
00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:15.700
me talk to this guy.
Cause he, he knows stuff.

446
00:25:15.730 --> 00:25:17.920
So then I talked to
ed, ed kind of gives

447
00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:20.920
me the rundown of like
all of the different things

448
00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:23.050
that I need to consider.
If we're going to, if

449
00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:26.140
I'm going to manufacture a
thing like the real scary,

450
00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:29.260
are you sure you're like
cut to do this kind

451
00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:33.700
of like conversation. It just
got me really jazzed. And

452
00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:37.300
then, you know, the first
thing that he said that

453
00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:39.280
like, well, not the first
thing, but maybe one of

454
00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:41.080
the ending things after I
said, yeah, I want to

455
00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:43.420
do this was, he was
like, you need money. If

456
00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:46.030
you're going to do this,
you need money. And like

457
00:25:46.090 --> 00:25:49.030
the first person you should
go ask is Tom, like

458
00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:51.880
go back to him and
have that conversation. And so,

459
00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:55.360
and so I did and
Tom, you know, over the

460
00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:58.330
series of a couple of
conversations and me kind of

461
00:25:58.330 --> 00:26:02.410
explaining where I wanted to
take this, supported me and

462
00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:04.570
gave me what I needed
to to see if it

463
00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:08.050
had legs. And that was,
you know, a very rare

464
00:26:08.050 --> 00:26:12.220
thing like a that I,
I knew someone who, you

465
00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:14.890
know, was, was going to
believe in me enough to

466
00:26:14.890 --> 00:26:17.800
put, put money toward it,
but also had the money

467
00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:19.840
to put toward it that,
that I could kind of

468
00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:23.530
start building this thing. And
so like from there, it

469
00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:26.800
really just kind of spread.
So then, you know, between

470
00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:30.190
Tom and ed helping make
introductions for me and then

471
00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:32.410
me reaching out to just
every other person I could

472
00:26:32.410 --> 00:26:36.220
think of that had some
relation to the things that

473
00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:38.710
I knew I needed to
know or figure out. I

474
00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:41.770
just started having a bunch
of coffees and lunches and

475
00:26:41.770 --> 00:26:46.020
dinners with people and just
trying to assemble the, all

476
00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:48.270
the pieces of how this
was going to come together.

477
00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:52.560
But like the, the real
key piece was an introduction

478
00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:54.690
that came from ed. So
again, the talk about sort

479
00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:58.410
of the access and network
thing, he introduced me to

480
00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:03.540
Linda who leads our product
development. And Linda basically, you

481
00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:07.200
know, came in with the,
the, the know at all

482
00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:08.940
in terms of like, okay,
this is what we need

483
00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:10.980
to do. Here's who we
need to contact. This is

484
00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:13.800
how we get started. And
then everything was ready to,

485
00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:16.260
you know, that's when it,
that's when it actually began

486
00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:21.410
that the making of the
product. So yeah, The, is

487
00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:24.080
there not to put too
fine a point on it,

488
00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:28.250
but if you hadn't that
moment taking the opportunity with

489
00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:30.380
that, that moment of access
to say, do you know

490
00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:35.990
anybody? It would have just
not happened. Yeah, totally. It's

491
00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:38.480
funny when you put it
like that, then that's totally

492
00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:43.010
true. So what is the,
this is a tough one

493
00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:46.130
tough way to ask this,
but I meet lots of

494
00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:48.890
people at conferences. You meet
people at Starbucks, you meet

495
00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:52.310
people in the produce aisle.
And what is the difference

496
00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:57.770
between what you did and
those people who are constantly

497
00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:01.420
trying to use one for
access, you know what I'm

498
00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:04.100
saying? I've always have people
asking me for help, but

499
00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:06.200
there's a moment there where
you make a judgment call

500
00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:08.840
where you say, this is
a really good idea, or

501
00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:11.690
this, this person isn't slimy,
you know, this person isn't

502
00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:14.450
trying to use me in
a, in a weird way.

503
00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:17.030
Is it because you'd already
built up relationships or is

504
00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:18.650
it because of the strength
of the idea? Because I

505
00:28:18.650 --> 00:28:21.290
know that I make a
judgment call all the time

506
00:28:21.290 --> 00:28:23.780
when someone sends me something
interesting and I'll say, yeah,

507
00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:25.970
yeah. And then I'll, you
know, I'll, I'll put a

508
00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:27.680
shoulder into it as I
like to say, and I'll

509
00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:30.170
help knock that door down.
And then, then they go

510
00:28:30.170 --> 00:28:31.970
running down the hall when
all I did was really

511
00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:34.760
just push on the door,
but other people will go,

512
00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:37.550
yeah, I think you're trying
to work the system here.

513
00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:40.910
Yeah. I think it's probably
a little bit of both

514
00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:44.000
like idea and relationship, but
I would say it's more

515
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.160
heavily weighted in relationship because
I like, and I said

516
00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:53.810
this to, to someone recently
that I think that, you

517
00:28:53.810 --> 00:28:58.490
know, more than money itself,
that relationships are the most

518
00:28:58.490 --> 00:29:01.250
valuable currency that you can
have when trying to do

519
00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:05.570
something like this. Because getting
people's help is, is the

520
00:29:05.570 --> 00:29:08.000
only way that you're going
to be able to pull

521
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.630
these things together, being able
to get in the room

522
00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:14.570
with the right people that
make things happen, or even

523
00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:17.330
have conversations where they actually
are going to try to

524
00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:20.420
consider and try to see
the vision that you have

525
00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:24.230
and do what they can
to help. So relationships are

526
00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:27.350
absolutely everything. So it's not
just a matter of, you

527
00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:29.510
know, like show for instance,
to take it back to

528
00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:32.000
that Tom example. It's not
just that I knew Tom,

529
00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:34.760
but that he and I
had a strong relationship. He

530
00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:37.460
had seen the kind of
things I could do after

531
00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:39.500
being at his company. When
I started at the company,

532
00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:43.060
I, I started time as
an office manager. I had

533
00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:45.580
just moved from the East
coast and didn't know anyone,

534
00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:47.710
but I was interested in
kind of getting in the

535
00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:51.670
tech industry and also meeting
some new people. And so,

536
00:29:52.330 --> 00:29:55.180
you know, I started there
kind of, you know, ordering

537
00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:57.910
office supplies. Like I was
like way over qualified for

538
00:29:57.910 --> 00:29:59.350
the job, but I was
like, this is going to

539
00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:01.690
be fun. And I want
to meet people. And this

540
00:30:01.690 --> 00:30:05.830
company is really cool. And,
and over time, like by

541
00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:08.260
the time I had that
conversation with Tom, like three

542
00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:10.660
and a half years later,
I was like running the

543
00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:13.900
marketing team. I was on
the executive team. And so

544
00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:17.650
like to see, you know,
Tom be able to observe

545
00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:20.590
and watch and be a
part of me coming through

546
00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:22.900
that organization and all of
the things that sort of

547
00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:26.110
played into that. Tom had
an idea of like, okay,

548
00:30:26.170 --> 00:30:28.150
she's a person that can
make something happen. I don't

549
00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:30.550
know if this is possible.
Even she doesn't know if

550
00:30:30.550 --> 00:30:32.740
this is possible even, but
if there's a person who

551
00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:36.780
can try to do that,
it's probably her, Right. You

552
00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:40.080
know, there's that famous quote
that says luck is what

553
00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:44.790
happens when preparation meets opportunity.
And I don't think that

554
00:30:44.790 --> 00:30:48.240
we dig into that preparation
part enough because preparation, isn't

555
00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:51.750
just, you know, a person
alone in their garage prepping

556
00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:54.210
and then waiting for, you
know, opportunity. And then calling

557
00:30:54.210 --> 00:30:57.540
the whole thing. Luck preparation
is spending 10 years building,

558
00:30:57.690 --> 00:31:02.880
building relationships, you know, building
a, building a tribe, building

559
00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:07.080
a network, going out into
the world and spreading positivity.

560
00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:10.110
And then there's a moment
when all of those things

561
00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:13.320
come together and someone says,
yeah, a beer, here you

562
00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:18.060
go. And again, it's not
that they did any work

563
00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:20.460
for you. They simply unlocked
a door. Or as I

564
00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:22.370
like to say, showed you
a window, you didn't realize

565
00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:25.110
was open. And then, you
know, he jumped through it

566
00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:28.770
and then there you go.
Yeah, no, that's, that's totally

567
00:31:28.770 --> 00:31:31.920
a thing. In fact, I
would even press that even

568
00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:35.520
more and say, in terms
of preparation, when I think

569
00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:37.770
of just the way that
I grew up, I grew

570
00:31:37.770 --> 00:31:43.620
up in a family business
and my, my family, particularly

571
00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:48.480
my grandmother, my father's mother,
she spent so much time

572
00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:52.620
with me and my cousins
as we were growing up

573
00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:56.850
as kids cultivating us to
have the skills that we

574
00:31:56.850 --> 00:32:01.740
needed to be good workers
in the world. And, and

575
00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:04.260
to be able to do
things and accomplish things and

576
00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:07.800
figure things out. I mean,
like, you know, when I

577
00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:11.220
was, I don't know, maybe
around like 10 or so

578
00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:13.320
years old, she had me
kind of working in the

579
00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:18.240
hair salon, making appointments for
people and, you know, on,

580
00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:23.610
on a computer learning sort
of Mavis beacon typing software.

581
00:32:23.610 --> 00:32:25.470
So I knew like all
of these kinds of things,

582
00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:28.590
like showing me how to
like launch a program from

583
00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:32.070
like dos and, and like
figure, you know, like how

584
00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:34.380
to be comfortable at a
computer and how to use

585
00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:36.870
it. And, you know, like
I was using windows when

586
00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:38.340
I was a kid and
it was like, it was

587
00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:41.000
a thing. And that was
because she felt like, you

588
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.370
know, those, those facets of
being able to work in

589
00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:45.890
an office and knowing how
things worked in business were

590
00:32:45.890 --> 00:32:49.530
really important. So some of
those things I think are

591
00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:51.590
just kind of ingrained in
me that a lot of

592
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:54.770
people don't learn until much
later in their lives. So

593
00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:58.060
preparation is key there too.
I'd say We spend so

594
00:32:58.060 --> 00:33:00.040
much time trying to teach
people to code. And I

595
00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:01.660
think we forget how to
teach people how to just

596
00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:03.880
shake hands and be humans
and talk to each other.

597
00:33:04.090 --> 00:33:06.550
Yeah, that was, I will
have to put that one

598
00:33:06.550 --> 00:33:09.130
on my dad. He's like
the most social. He will

599
00:33:09.130 --> 00:33:11.830
make friends with anybody in
a room and he used

600
00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:13.780
to do this thing to
me where we would go

601
00:33:14.170 --> 00:33:16.540
and be at like, you
know, social events. And he

602
00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:18.400
would just like, you know,
push me out there and

603
00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:20.920
tell me, you're going to
introduce yourself to three people

604
00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:23.830
in this room. Like before
we leave, like you're going

605
00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:25.840
to go and you're going
to get that person's card.

606
00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:29.860
Like that was, that's like
the thing, you know, so

607
00:33:29.890 --> 00:33:32.350
now I feel like I
can definitely hold my own

608
00:33:32.350 --> 00:33:34.030
in a room and I'm
not afraid to go out

609
00:33:34.030 --> 00:33:36.580
and introduce myself to someone,
but that's not a thing

610
00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:38.950
that a lot of people
kind of grow up with

611
00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:46.000
with that kind of pressure.
Go introduce yourself. Very cool.

612
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.640
Well, people can go to
tinsel. T I N S

613
00:33:48.670 --> 00:33:51.940
E L dot M E.
And you can actually reserve

614
00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:55.150
your, your dipper audio necklace
right now. Can't you? That's

615
00:33:55.150 --> 00:33:58.930
right. Shipping spring of 2016.
Thanks so much for chatting

616
00:33:58.930 --> 00:34:01.990
with me today. Thank you
for having me. This has

617
00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:04.480
been another episode of Hanselminutes
and we'll see you again

618
00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:05.110
next week.
