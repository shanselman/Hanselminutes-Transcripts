This is Lawrence Ryan announcing show
number 533. In this episode,

10
00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.260
Scott talks with Carolino Stewart
about building remote first teams.

11
00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.830
Hi, this is Scott Hanselman.
This is another episode of

12
00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.270
Hansel minutes today. I'm talking
with Carolina store. He's calling

13
00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.750
in from Australia. How are
you? Hey, I'm good. I'm

14
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.960
very happy to talk to
you because I'm a remote

15
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.390
worker, as people who listened
to the show know I've

16
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.940
been a remote worker now
for gosh, almost nine years,

17
00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.600
and you wrote this wonderful
medium post that kind of

18
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.850
went viral on building remote
first teams. It's quite extensive

19
00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.090
with this post. Yeah, actually
I was giving a talk

20
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.720
at a company that I'm
working at about remote culture.

21
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.280
So I'm working at an
Nevato, which isn't a remote

22
00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.450
first company, but a remote
friendly company. And there are

23
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.630
a lot of people who
are really interested in remote

24
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.770
way of working, but because
it's a free hundred plus

25
00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.550
company, it's quite hard to
implement that. Not, you know,

26
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.970
not from very beginning, so
it's quite challenging. So I

27
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.160
thought it would be beneficial
to start talking about it

28
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.460
more openly, have more workshops
about that and just the

29
00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.790
general knowledge and are doing
pretty well right now in

30
00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.120
terms of implementing flexible schedules
and what not. And I

31
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.160
started writing this talk. It
was supposed to be a

32
00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.520
20 minute talk and it
just grew into like 50

33
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.990
minute narrative and then like
another Friday minute discussion. So

34
00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.750
I decided, Hmm, maybe it
wouldn't be beneficial to actually

35
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.210
share that with the world.
And then actually when I

36
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.850
finished the pose, it was
so long, I started thinking

37
00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.820
about writing a book because
it was so ridiculously long.

38
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.870
Yeah. Medium has this feature
where they tell you how

39
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.900
many minutes it will take
to read. And it says

40
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.680
15 minutes, which on the
internet is like an hour,

41
00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.830
you know? Yeah, no one
read that. But the, the

42
00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.690
thing that was interesting, I
thought was that the title

43
00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.310
hits you right off the
bat. It says building first.

44
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.660
And it's that kind of
like a controversial statement, you

45
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.580
know, that got people thinking
when you say things like

46
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.340
building websites and mobile first
and people like, no, that's

47
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.820
insane. And then of course
they do that. What do

48
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.110
you mean by remote first?
So I think it's really

49
00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.270
important to differentiate in between
remote friendly and remote first.

50
00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.380
And it actually is something
that I was very frustrated

51
00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.300
about when I started working
here in Australia. So as

52
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.630
a person moving from Europe
to Australia, like that's quite

53
00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.920
a significant flight, 40 hours,
like it's just very far.

54
00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.670
So I'm even thinking about
taking time off to visit

55
00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.610
your family. Like it's a
very big deal. So if

56
00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.820
you're a, not at a
remote first company, that might

57
00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.880
be problematic because you just
have to, you cannot work

58
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.890
at cross so many times
that is because it's like

59
00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.880
nine hour difference. It's really
difficult to sync with teammates.

60
00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.420
You basically can't do that
unless you're working hilariously late

61
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.740
or really early in the
morning. So it becomes problematic.

62
00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.950
So kind of out of,
out of that frustration, I

63
00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.970
really started thinking about what's
the difference in between remote

64
00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.430
first and remote friendly? Because
a lot of people say

65
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.400
like, Oh yeah, it's totally
fun if you work from

66
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.180
home two days per week,
but like, that's not really

67
00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.820
rebel if you know what
I mean, because when you're

68
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.930
remote first that basically says
that you can work from

69
00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:33.780
literally anywhere in the world
at any time. So that's

70
00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.950
what remote first means to
me, I've found in, in

71
00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.490
working at, at Microsoft remotely,
that everyone has an excuse

72
00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.540
about like why remoteness is
bad. What are, what are

73
00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.120
some of the excuses that
companies use to say that

74
00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.350
we shouldn't have remote workers?
I think it's mostly meetings

75
00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.440
trying to coordinate meetings and
trying to have that face

76
00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.970
to face time that you're
lacking when you're remote. And

77
00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.900
honestly, now that I'm working
in a much bigger organization

78
00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.450
that I used to work
at in the past, I

79
00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:09.750
actually find that problem being
quite true. Like sometimes you

80
00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.500
just can't, you know, move
things forward without like kind

81
00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.930
of having a face to
face or voice to voice

82
00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:22.020
meeting. So I can definitely
understand that excuse, although like

83
00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.620
really trying to force fully
have a meeting with all

84
00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.370
the people at cross a
big team at once. I

85
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.820
don't know if that's hugely
beneficial, but I definitely understand

86
00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.980
excuse of like trying to
be on the same page

87
00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:38.190
because otherwise in some scenarios
and sometimes in some companies,

88
00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:43.680
the communication channels aren't too
great and collaboration isn't very

89
00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.560
strong. So it takes a
long time to discuss something

90
00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.110
even in person. So if
you think about putting that

91
00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.100
communication on email or Slack
or wherever else, it will

92
00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:56.550
be like just terribly inefficient.
So I can definitely understand

93
00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:01.300
that concern. Like the remote
worker is always the one

94
00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.900
that has to change their
behavior or change their situation.

95
00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.410
Or, you know, we say
fall on their sword. Like

96
00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:12.130
I currently have three people
who work for me and

97
00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:15.610
I'm in Portland, which is
GMT minus eight, they're GMT

98
00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:17.710
minus five, but I've also
got one person who's in

99
00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.890
Ireland, which I think isn't
GMT. And it always seems

100
00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:22.750
like the Irish guy is
the one who has to

101
00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.750
stay up late or get
up early, you know? And

102
00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.300
he does it calmly and
quietly. And doesn't, doesn't say

103
00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.870
anything, but I'm trying to
realize that he hurts more

104
00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:35.740
as a remote and almost
hides his remoteness by working

105
00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:40.480
later or putting up with
our weirdly houred meetings. Does

106
00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.310
it always have to be
that the remote person hurts

107
00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:46.390
the most? That's definitely something
I've thought about a lot.

108
00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:49.240
And that's something that has
been happening to me in

109
00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.720
the past when I was
working remotely, mostly from Europe,

110
00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:55.900
for us based companies, because
that was always a six

111
00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:59.470
or nine hour difference. And
I always stayed up late

112
00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:04.180
to have meetings or calls
and whatnot. And I did

113
00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:07.900
it without being negative about
it because I just always

114
00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.690
thought, well, this is the
price that you pay for

115
00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:15.070
ultimate flexibility of working wherever.
And whenever you want to,

116
00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:18.730
which is a great flexibility,
especially if you're a person

117
00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:21.700
who like really likes, I
dunno, like to exercise or

118
00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:26.110
like have 100% freedom, like
it's bright, but I don't

119
00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:28.390
know. I just kinda always
fought that it was the

120
00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:32.470
price to pay. So I
shouldn't complain about it. But

121
00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:35.770
on the other hand, it
kinda, it kinda weirds me

122
00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:38.890
out. Especially if you have
a partially remote company and

123
00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:43.180
you have a headquarters somewhere
in one place, usually in

124
00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:45.100
the U S and then
you have a bunch of

125
00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:47.470
people who are scattered all
over the world and they

126
00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:50.470
have to comply with the
HQ who sets the meetings.

127
00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:53.380
That kind of feels awkward.
Maybe you could rotate the

128
00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:58.420
meetings to like, make it
equally uncomfortable for all the

129
00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:00.760
people. I don't know if
that would be really feasible.

130
00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:05.440
You, you say in your,
in your post that an

131
00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:08.830
excuse is I can't get
this ASAP as soon as

132
00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:12.100
possible. And that in, in
that idea that it has

133
00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:15.640
to happen immediately. We stop
valuing each other's time and

134
00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:19.480
attention. And to our point
just now we may be

135
00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:23.110
valuing the remote workers time
less, just because they're remote.

136
00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:28.030
Yeah. Maybe because again, you
have to somehow have meetings.

137
00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:32.110
So someone will have a
meeting either really early or

138
00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:35.350
really late. So it will
be a nuisance to someone,

139
00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:40.510
for sure. I don't know
if that's necessarily something disrespectful,

140
00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:43.300
but I think there would
be ways to kind of

141
00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:47.860
mitigate how uncomfortable that makes
you feel. Because like, not

142
00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:50.380
like I hate meetings in
the afternoons, like I never

143
00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:52.660
scheduled them. And if someone
really wants to talk to

144
00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:54.940
me in the afternoon, I'm
like, Hmm, can't really do

145
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:57.270
like, that's my time off.
And I do whatever I

146
00:08:57.270 --> 00:09:01.710
want. So I remember being
slightly annoyed by that when

147
00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:06.300
I was working remotely with
us, which basically meant meetings

148
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:08.970
in the evening or at
like meetings in my pajamas,

149
00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:13.920
which isn't like the best
thing to do. So, yeah.

150
00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:17.390
So you said that you
like your afternoon is your

151
00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:19.880
time. Everyone has their time.
That they're the most productive

152
00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:22.250
or the time when they're
expected to work. And they

153
00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:24.410
try to, you know, we
spend our whole lives trying

154
00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:28.490
to balance time off with
time at work. Do, do

155
00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:33.620
you think sometimes that the
bosses and HQ think that

156
00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:36.290
we, the remote workers are
just hanging out just going

157
00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:38.750
to the zoo every day
and just, you know, not

158
00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:41.210
working, are they, is there,
is there always that stigma

159
00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:44.510
that the remote worker isn't
working? Hmm. I don't know.

160
00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:48.050
I personally never felt that,
but I was quite lucky

161
00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:52.010
to work at some really
good companies who really knew

162
00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:54.410
how to work remotely. And
they're really good in terms

163
00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:57.440
of company culture as well
and collaboration. So I personally

164
00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:00.650
never felt that, but I
can definitely see that happening

165
00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:03.530
because it's easy to think
like, well, they have no

166
00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:06.530
overlap of the HQ, so
they could be doing anything

167
00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:10.250
like just slacking instead of
working. And then you kind

168
00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:12.650
of get into deadlines. So
if I've trying to control

169
00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:15.980
and trying to figure out
is that enough contributions per

170
00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:19.130
day. And I just think
that's a very toxic environment

171
00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:21.890
to be in. Like, I,
I would personally hate that.

172
00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:27.650
Do you think that It
gets overwhelming the downsides? Like

173
00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:30.350
I find that it's quite
lonely to be remote and

174
00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:35.120
leaders that get it are
not very common. Do you

175
00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:38.240
ever just say, well, it's
just not worth it? Hmm.

176
00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:41.360
I don't know. I D
I definitely get frustrated with

177
00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:43.880
it. And even when I
was writing that article, thinking

178
00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:47.150
about the downsides, I was
like, Oh, it actually gets

179
00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:51.650
really hard sometimes. But honestly,
especially now in my current

180
00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:54.860
situation where I live in
Australia and all of my

181
00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:57.620
friends basically, and all of
my family is back in

182
00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:01.190
Europe. I really value remote
because if I had full

183
00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:03.860
flexibility to like travel and
see my friends travel and

184
00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:06.560
see my family that's really
important to me. So I

185
00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:12.770
can tackle the downsides with
easiness or with difficulty, but

186
00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:16.640
for that price, definitely. But
I can see it being

187
00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:20.420
very, very lonely, especially again,
if you have like leadership

188
00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:26.480
oriented leadership, look at it
somewhere else, you just feel

189
00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.580
like you don't have any
impact. Do you feel like

190
00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:31.880
you don't have any, you
know, a connection to the

191
00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:34.820
company? Like I can, I
can definitely see that being

192
00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:38.570
failing only in small or
big teams. It doesn't really

193
00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:42.960
matter to be honest, When
I go up to the

194
00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:46.610
main office, there's this kind
of energy and we spend

195
00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:49.160
a lot more time, time
standing and meetings, and there's

196
00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.020
like, there there's a, you
know, an energy is an

197
00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:54.400
intensity of being like on
or at the home office.

198
00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:58.210
And, and then I, I
think to myself, well, maybe

199
00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:00.760
I should move here, but
then I come back home

200
00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:04.210
and then, you know, it's,
there's an extremist. There's like,

201
00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.030
there's, there's the extreme intensity
of being there. And there's

202
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:09.790
kind of the downside of
coming, coming back. It seems

203
00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:13.260
hard to find balance, you
know? Yeah. It's definitely either

204
00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:16.890
like really intense human interaction,
which for me as a

205
00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:20.370
person is a little bit
too much or you go

206
00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:24.210
home and you're completely alone.
But what I found when

207
00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:27.390
I'm working remotely, and sometimes
I'm working for like a

208
00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:31.860
little kind of friend coworking
space, super small for 10

209
00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:34.800
people, and sometimes I'm working
from home alone. So it's

210
00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:37.470
just me and my cat
sometimes more partnered as well.

211
00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.230
But sometimes I go to
the office when I'm like,

212
00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.090
Oh, I have a lot
of meetings. I should just

213
00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:43.980
go to the office and
do that in person. It

214
00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:47.910
will be easier. But yeah,
it does get really lonely,

215
00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:51.990
which is why I try
to compensate that work loneliness

216
00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:56.100
with like socializing with my
friends, which actually has a

217
00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:59.580
really good effect on mental
health. Because if you really

218
00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:02.400
make conscious effort to spend
time with your friends after

219
00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:05.850
work, like it's a good
pastime. You don't spend time

220
00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:09.090
overworking, which is really easy
for remote people because again,

221
00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:12.960
time zones and you kind
of compensate for the lack

222
00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:17.610
of face to face interaction
at work. Yeah. We've tried

223
00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:22.410
to do open Skype calls.
So we'll dedicate a monitor

224
00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:24.990
to just an open Skype.
And even though you don't

225
00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:27.450
have a meeting, maybe you'll
put the person off to

226
00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:29.730
the corner. It's almost like
having a cubicle mate that

227
00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:33.000
sits next to you, and
then we'll position the camera

228
00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:35.790
rather than pointing at your
face, pointing to your side

229
00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:38.550
of your face. So this
way you're not staring at

230
00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:42.480
some, you know, someone's random
face during a code, but

231
00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:44.190
the idea that you can
turn your head to one

232
00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:47.130
side and there's your, your
cubicle buddy, and we'll just

233
00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:49.230
keep a call open for,
you know, an hour, hour

234
00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:50.970
and a half, and we'll
kind of quietly work and

235
00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:53.520
do our thing, but there's
just at least that sense

236
00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:56.220
that your coworker is there
we'll have remote two remote

237
00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:58.560
people do that, like a
portal that's open to the

238
00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.900
other side. Yeah. I think,
I think I've seen that

239
00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:03.660
before. I think there's even
a product that does that.

240
00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:07.320
Just people hanging out together,
not necessarily for proposal meeting.

241
00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:12.840
I think that that can
definitely help with the illness,

242
00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:15.570
although I can kind of
imagine it being slightly creepy,

243
00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:17.190
like when you're at home
and you're like, Oh, I'm

244
00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:20.490
wearing jumpsuits and, or like
your cat jumps at your

245
00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:23.730
face or something that I
always like that happens. Right.

246
00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:26.940
Sure. I think it's all
about balance, right? For me

247
00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:29.280
sometimes I get frustrated because
I'm either at home and

248
00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:32.460
it's quiet or I'm at
a cafe and it's too

249
00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:35.940
much, or the internet sucks.
I've really struggled with, I

250
00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:39.180
want the people around me,
but I need decent internet

251
00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:41.850
to have a video call.
So I don't know about

252
00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:43.410
how it works there, but
I, if I, even if

253
00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:47.400
I go to like a
cafe or somewhere to sit

254
00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:51.590
and have coffee, there's not
quality enough internet as good

255
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:53.990
as my house for me
to really interact with people.

256
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:58.670
So I interact with other
people at home using video.

257
00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:02.590
Yeah. I tend to do
that as well. Although Australia

258
00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:07.750
has really well known problems
with internet connection and at

259
00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:11.770
home, I have DSL, which
is the equivalent of maybe

260
00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:16.270
12 megabytes down, which is
hilariously bad. Even in comparison

261
00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:21.380
to internet ahead in the
suburbs in Poland, This just

262
00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:24.880
like a, it's like your
phone It's Oh, no, Ellen.

263
00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:28.420
If we tethered our phones,
we would have like 80

264
00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:31.530
men a mix down. So
it's really bad. Like it's,

265
00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:35.740
it's disappointing really bad. Although
that depends on the area

266
00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:37.660
of the city where like,
which city do you live

267
00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:40.420
in which area of the
city? Because there is a

268
00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:44.350
there's internet connection called NBN,
which is supposed to be

269
00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:48.220
like cable speed, very fast
internet, but not everyone can

270
00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:51.460
get it. And unfortunately we
didn't get it. So our

271
00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:56.500
connection is quite ridiculously bad.
Sometimes we just sit@homeandstareongoogle.com trying

272
00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:59.260
to load for like free
minutes. And you just want

273
00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:02.230
to give up, so going
into a cafe, if you

274
00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:05.020
know, a good place is
a really good thing, because

275
00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:08.380
usually they will have a
better connection that you do

276
00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:12.850
at home, which is quite
ridiculous. But yeah, sometimes it

277
00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:15.040
just gets too busy for
me. It's a thing of

278
00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:18.400
like determining, which are my
favorite spots. I know when

279
00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:21.430
they're busy, I know. And
they're like really good to

280
00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:24.340
sit in to like, kind
of hang out for an

281
00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:26.800
hour or two, but it's
always kind of uncomfortable for

282
00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:29.890
longer than that. So I'm
not a huge cafe worker.

283
00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:32.710
Yeah. If I only had
one that had great internet

284
00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:34.300
and I also don't like,
I don't know how it

285
00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:35.980
works there, but after a
few hours, they start to

286
00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:38.500
look at you with a
side-eye like, why are you

287
00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:41.620
here? You haven't ordered enough
to be here. As long

288
00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:44.020
as you are here, you
should go. They don't ever

289
00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:45.490
say anything. They just look
at you and make you

290
00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:47.830
feel sad. So then you
have to leave. I kind

291
00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:49.900
of experienced that when I
was traveling to U S

292
00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:53.620
multiple times, especially in New York,
San Francisco was better, but

293
00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:57.670
New York was just, they hate
it. There's no, yeah, there's

294
00:16:57.670 --> 00:17:00.550
no internet and most of
the cafes. And if you

295
00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:03.340
go and even order a
lot, because I always feel

296
00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:06.580
bad about it. They're just
like, just leave. Can you

297
00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:09.940
leave? Right. You're taking up
space that a paying customer

298
00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:12.760
as frustrate. Okay. Well, let's
think about less of it.

299
00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:15.370
Let's not think about the
negativity, but let's think about

300
00:17:15.370 --> 00:17:17.560
the positive stuff. I think
the number one thing that

301
00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:19.840
makes me happy about working
remote is that I don't

302
00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:22.450
have to commute. My wife
has a half an hour

303
00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:25.390
commute. I took my kids
to campus morning. It was

304
00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:30.550
an hour like what's the
average commute. Now I think

305
00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:34.480
it's around an hour within
the us and UK as

306
00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:37.690
well. I actually was looking
up the stats for the

307
00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:41.260
Erica because I was curious,
I live for the central

308
00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:44.500
and the office that I'm
commuting to is really central,

309
00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:48.220
but the commute is unlike
the worst tramline in Melbourne

310
00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:52.470
and always crowded. It doesn't
matter. It's always something weird

311
00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:55.410
happening on the tram and
takes like 45 minutes one

312
00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:58.080
way. And I just feel
like it's wasted time. Like

313
00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:02.280
I just it's really bad.
I just really don't enjoy

314
00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:05.100
that. I know some people
actually use their laptop on

315
00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:08.820
a tram or like read
something or listen to podcasts.

316
00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:11.430
But for me, it just
feels like you're trying to

317
00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:16.140
force me into this tram
or bus and just feels

318
00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:18.270
like a waste of time.
So I definitely think that

319
00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:21.540
not having to commute is
one of the best things.

320
00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:24.740
Yeah. I could see myself
perhaps tethering my phone and

321
00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:26.660
checking email, but you know,
there's only so much of

322
00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:30.140
that you can do. And
if email, the internet comes

323
00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:32.720
and goes, of course I
have, when I was commuting,

324
00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:34.490
I had to drive a
car and then you're just

325
00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:38.150
stuck. And I think it
increases your stress and it

326
00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:41.660
might even shorten your life.
Yeah. I read some studies

327
00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:46.550
about stress connected to commuting,
and there's basically no positivity

328
00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:48.860
in commute at all. I
mean, sure. You could maybe

329
00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:52.250
cycle in some cities with
good weather and whatnot and

330
00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:56.960
backtracks. But other than that,
I can't see any positive

331
00:18:56.990 --> 00:19:00.560
outcomes of that. Could it
be argued then that remote

332
00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:03.470
workers could be more productive
because we have that extra

333
00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:06.500
hour or hour and a
half a day. And plus

334
00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:08.780
I feel like remote workers,
because we feel a little

335
00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:11.450
bit guilty about being remote.
We also tend to work

336
00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:14.480
more hours at night. Oh
yeah. I feel like remote

337
00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:18.440
workers definitely try to overcompensate
because like, they feel like

338
00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:21.950
they have so many distractions
at their homes. You need

339
00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:25.160
to make up for that.
And also you have to

340
00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:28.460
show more output because well,
no one sees you at

341
00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:31.310
the office. So how would
they know how good you

342
00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:33.950
are? Right. Which is kind
of toxic as well. Like

343
00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:37.640
it has a downside, but
to me the time just

344
00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:40.820
commute time, that's not wasted
as just more time to

345
00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:44.090
myself. I'm usually up quite
early. So I can even

346
00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:46.880
start work at seven and
I'm done by free. And

347
00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:49.430
I have so much time
to myself, which is great.

348
00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:54.530
Doesn't that mean that you
are a person who sprints,

349
00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:57.740
like you don't sit down
and check Reddit from seven

350
00:19:57.740 --> 00:19:59.900
to three, you are sitting
down and you work and

351
00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:01.850
when you are done, then
you are done. It sounds

352
00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:04.900
like you've compartmentalized your work
quite, quite nicely. That, that,

353
00:20:04.910 --> 00:20:08.870
that takes some willpower. I
would think I actually struggle

354
00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:12.590
with destructions. Sometimes I get
stuck on Twitter or I

355
00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:15.980
start reading some medium articles,
but it's not too bad.

356
00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:20.120
Or the eternal problem of
too many Slack channels for

357
00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:24.740
every existing and our current
state of, of technology. But

358
00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:27.410
yeah, it's, it's not too
bad. I must say, I

359
00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:29.990
just prefer to be productive
and do whatever I plan

360
00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:32.240
to do for a day
and then work on my

361
00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:34.820
side projects or just go
out or do whatever else

362
00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:41.240
I plan to do. Yeah.
I feel like I, I,

363
00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:44.240
distraction is a big problem
and I, I'm always working

364
00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:46.400
at different times. I talk
a lot about work life

365
00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:50.080
balance, but I'm trying to
make up for things like

366
00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:53.290
today. Mike pick my kids
up at camp at four.

367
00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:55.630
So I'm very aware of
the fact that there was

368
00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:58.150
a 60 minute period in
the middle of the day

369
00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:00.790
where I was gone. I
was not working. I was

370
00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:03.730
with my kids. So when
I put them to sleep

371
00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:06.640
tonight, I will try to
make up that hour. I

372
00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:10.990
wish I could be more
focused and just compartmentalize my

373
00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:15.090
work. I've kind of learned
to accept that, especially in

374
00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:18.810
like deeply technical work or
even design work, you just

375
00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:20.940
can't do more than six
hours per day. Like it's

376
00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:23.820
just impossible. I don't know
how many people have the

377
00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:26.550
mental capacity to be highly
productive for more than six

378
00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:29.100
hours. I definitely can't. So
I have just embraced that.

379
00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:33.180
And besides when sure. Remote
workers are trying to overcompensate,

380
00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:35.940
so work longer hours, and
they're very conscious of the

381
00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:38.760
distractions, like going through a
gym, going out for lunch

382
00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:41.850
or whatever else they do.
But if you think critically

383
00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:45.690
about people at offices, they
procrastinate all the time. Like

384
00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:49.920
it's not really a problem.
That's really a remote person

385
00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:52.980
problem. Like it happens in
offices all the time. People

386
00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:56.130
go play ping pong, people
chat for like 40 minutes

387
00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:59.610
by the elevator or elsewhere.
So I don't know. I

388
00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:03.240
just don't try not to
get myself that I was

389
00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:06.090
away for Fredman is because
like my cat was annoying

390
00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:09.450
or something else. Like, I
didn't know. I tried to

391
00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:12.390
reach my goals for the
day every single day and

392
00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:14.880
try to be as productive
as possible, but not trying

393
00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:18.330
to get myself, which is
a problem for remote workers.

394
00:22:18.330 --> 00:22:22.800
Like it's quite obvious that
they got themselves into working

395
00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:25.860
more because of that overcompensation
of like lack of your

396
00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:30.390
physical presence in the office.
So you, so you're arguing

397
00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:34.080
for not just self care,
but also for forgiving oneself

398
00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:35.580
and saying, listen, you're only
going to get so many

399
00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:42.870
hours of work done. You're
really not going to you.

400
00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:44.730
Shouldn't fool yourself into thinking
that you're going to get

401
00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:47.580
12 productive hours a day.
And there's no reason to

402
00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:51.150
feel bad about that. The
reality is people work a

403
00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:52.620
little bit and then they
take a break and then

404
00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:55.110
they work a little bit.
Yeah, definitely. I mean, I

405
00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:57.810
say that, but I struggle
with that mindset all the

406
00:22:57.810 --> 00:23:00.510
time. And I was even
thinking about that lately, how

407
00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:03.570
we perceive people on the
web, like people who work

408
00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:05.730
in the industry and how
much they output and were

409
00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:09.480
so output oriented and think
that artists achieve so much

410
00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:13.440
and we achieve so little
as individuals. It's a problem.

411
00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:16.320
Like we, we have to
kind of cut ourselves a

412
00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:18.870
little bit of Slack and
realize, okay, this is the

413
00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:21.480
amount of time I probably
will be productive today because

414
00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:23.880
that's my mental capacity. And
also you have to take

415
00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:27.270
breaks, but you know, it's
reasonable to set up small

416
00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:30.840
goals and just push forward.
And, and if you, if

417
00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:34.140
you have progress each day,
that's good. Like that's what

418
00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:36.330
you have to count on
because you can't just set

419
00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:40.620
unreasonable, unreasonable goals and sacrifice
your own personal time just

420
00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:43.230
to be like, Oh, I
clock nine hours. Yes. That

421
00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:45.740
was really great because I
don't think anyone thinks that

422
00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:50.260
after like nine hours of
work, Now you had mentioned

423
00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:53.200
slacking off, which remind me
of Slack, which everyone seems

424
00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:55.840
to think is the, you
know, the second coming of

425
00:23:56.170 --> 00:23:59.530
the great productivity tool that,
you know, Moses himself brought

426
00:23:59.530 --> 00:24:02.110
down the 10 commandments and
they went back up and

427
00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:06.280
brought us Slack. I personally
find Slack to be extremely

428
00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:09.370
distracting. And I'm now in
seven different slacks and there's

429
00:24:09.370 --> 00:24:11.680
no easy way to sign
into the mall. I'm constantly

430
00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:15.760
switching around. It's almost like
having seven Slack channels is

431
00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:19.810
like opening up seven tabs
in your browser that are

432
00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:22.330
all refreshing with new information
that you're not sure if

433
00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:25.000
you need or not. So
you just panic and run

434
00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.370
around checking stuff. And none
of it is any value.

435
00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:30.580
I am surprised. I love
my friends at Slack and

436
00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:33.880
I originally liked Slack, but
if you don't have one

437
00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:36.970
Slack channel, I don't know
how people survive. Like I

438
00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:38.410
don't know what you can
do with more than one.

439
00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:43.600
Yeah. I definitely, I love
their design and I love

440
00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:46.720
the execution. I'm a fan
of slag, but yeah, I'm

441
00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:49.330
in several slacks. I think
five at this point, I

442
00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:52.090
think I left four of
them because I just couldn't

443
00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:54.190
read them. And I was
like, I just can't bear

444
00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:58.000
the stress of just having
those unread notifications. So many

445
00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.750
of them, I have to
look at it during the

446
00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:05.380
work hours. Definitely because there's
just so many notifications from

447
00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:09.430
like the pulleys or bugs
stuff that I have to

448
00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:12.250
react to. So I definitely
have to check that. And

449
00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:15.520
there are some questions that
I just ask synchronously to

450
00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:17.940
be able, that I work
with. So that's good. But

451
00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:21.130
other than that, I've experimented
with do not disturb. I

452
00:25:21.130 --> 00:25:25.600
experimented with hiding old the
channels and the, that don't

453
00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:31.990
have unreads, which is actually
quite calming. I found quite

454
00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:35.110
a good feature, but definitely
I think second gen and

455
00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:38.140
people really love it, but
I think it's really dangerous

456
00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:41.590
for productivity. I definitely my
best work happens when I

457
00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:44.230
turn it off. Like, but
that's work outside of work

458
00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:46.930
actually, because during work times
again, like I have to

459
00:25:47.050 --> 00:25:49.720
have it all Right. Would
it not be fair to

460
00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:52.630
say then that your feelings
about email are probably similar?

461
00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:56.920
Like email is just Slack
with a crappy interface and

462
00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:59.470
a little bit more asynchronous.
You do your best work

463
00:25:59.470 --> 00:26:02.380
when it's closed. Yeah. I
only opened email like twice

464
00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:08.260
per day. Maybe In my
productivity talks, I challenge people

465
00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:09.970
and I would challenge the
people who are listening right

466
00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:13.300
now to not check email
in the morning. If you

467
00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:15.340
check email first thing in
the morning, it's a really

468
00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:20.440
easy way to time travel
to after lunch. Yeah. Yeah,

469
00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:22.960
definitely. I mean, it always
depends on the person how

470
00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:26.200
much email they get. I
never got a lot of

471
00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:29.950
emails because I'm very clear
on my expectations. I don't

472
00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:32.050
sign up for a lot
of things. I'm very picky.

473
00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:34.960
I'm quite efficient with the
conversations that I have. So

474
00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:37.240
it's not too bad for
me, but I definitely can

475
00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:39.700
see that happening. And I
think it's super refreshing to

476
00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:41.860
just keep it to once
or twice per day. Like

477
00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:45.330
it's meant to be a,
so Don expect that someone

478
00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:49.490
will reply to you in
15 minutes. So when thinking

479
00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:52.880
about hiring, what do you
do if a company isn't

480
00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:54.620
like, what if you're the
first remote? Or what if

481
00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:57.710
you're just trying to get
hired somewhere? Like people won't

482
00:26:57.710 --> 00:27:01.490
hire you unless there's already
remote that. Right. Usually, yes.

483
00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:04.970
I actually, when I was
looking for a new gig

484
00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:08.000
last year in November, I
talked to a lot of

485
00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.470
companies and a lot of
them claimed that they were

486
00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:13.820
remit and they were in,
there are a lot of

487
00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:16.820
companies who are US-based and
say like, yeah, we are

488
00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:19.250
remote. And then when you
say I'm from Europe or

489
00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:21.950
from Australia and they're like,
no, we don't do that.

490
00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:25.490
So that's again, circling back
to remote first and remote

491
00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:30.080
friendly. Like again, that's, that's
just saying that. Sure. Like

492
00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:32.420
you can work outside of
an office, but within a

493
00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:37.070
country. So to me, this
kind of faking remoteness, so

494
00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:40.140
definitely it's better to go
into a company that has

495
00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:42.830
been already doing a remote
because they probably have some

496
00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:47.120
tools in place. They have
some experience. Otherwise it's quite

497
00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:50.990
scary, depending on which scale,
if it's a small startup,

498
00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:54.140
then I guess you have
more control over the process.

499
00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:57.680
You can kind of implement
changes quickly. So that would

500
00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:00.770
work better. But in a
bigger companies, just transferring, you

501
00:28:00.770 --> 00:28:05.120
know, like changing from completely
onsite company to remote company

502
00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:08.300
can oftentimes be a disaster
because they just don't have

503
00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:11.210
the tools or the experience.
So I think if you're

504
00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:14.510
trying to build a remote
culture, definitely you have to

505
00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:17.480
hire people who have experienced
that and have knowledge to

506
00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:23.030
share in that topic. And
when you, when you finally

507
00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:27.020
have hired someone, do you
think it's important to match

508
00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:31.220
the job perks? Cause it
seems like onsite people get

509
00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:34.310
parties and perks and different
things that are available or

510
00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:36.230
they might get different health
care while you're in another

511
00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:37.940
country and you might get
different healthcare. How do you

512
00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:42.350
match the perks of remotes
and onsite employees? So that's

513
00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:44.660
a thing that might be
quite problematic, but I still

514
00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:46.820
think it's an issue that
can be solved. I was

515
00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:50.270
always very frustrated because I
never got any perks. And

516
00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:54.080
also you're always, and most
scenarios, a consultant from overseas.

517
00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:56.450
So you pay your own
tax, you do your own

518
00:28:56.450 --> 00:28:58.790
accounting, you did this and
that. So there are a

519
00:28:58.790 --> 00:29:00.680
lot of, there's a lot
of overhead for you as

520
00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:02.630
a person. And there are
no parks. Like you don't

521
00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:04.700
get a free phone or
like sometimes they didn't even

522
00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:06.650
get a free laptop. You
don't, you don't get then

523
00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:09.980
thing. And I'm like, well,
I'm the same? Like, I'm

524
00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:13.490
the same quality of an
employee, right? You hired me

525
00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:15.830
full time to work at
a company. So there's no

526
00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:17.930
difference in between me and
a person who is like

527
00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:21.920
in country X working in
an office. So I think

528
00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:24.500
indefinitely, like order equipment and
send it to them. Like,

529
00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:27.200
that's not a problem. You
can match health insurance. You

530
00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:29.090
can say like, okay, what's
the cost of a health

531
00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:31.190
insurance in our country. I'm
going to pay that on

532
00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:33.740
top of your salary or
your career plan. Like you

533
00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:36.680
can, you can fix that.
So that's just kind of

534
00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:39.380
up to the company to
make that work. And I

535
00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:41.800
think there are companies that
do that, like buffer or,

536
00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:44.730
or help scout. Do you
think that there's just a

537
00:29:44.730 --> 00:29:47.340
list, like I see at
the end of your post,

538
00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:49.860
you list out some of
the companies that we all

539
00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:53.190
know are good at remote
stuff, but I mean, surely

540
00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:55.020
there must be a better
way to find folks than

541
00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:58.080
just to pick the top
12 companies. Yeah. There is,

542
00:29:58.110 --> 00:30:02.820
there is a good hub
repository that Jessica from Jessica

543
00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:05.310
card from, from get hub
was working on and people

544
00:30:05.310 --> 00:30:09.420
contribute to it for like
the last couple months. But

545
00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:13.730
again, they have, all of
them have different understandings of

546
00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:16.110
remit and a lot of
them are U S only,

547
00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:20.880
which again, enters that gray
area of, is it really

548
00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:24.920
remote or is it not?
So yeah, I actually found

549
00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:27.690
it really problematic. It's a
really hyped topic to talk

550
00:30:27.690 --> 00:30:30.720
about remote. Everyone is like,
we love remote. There are

551
00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:33.690
so many remote jobs, but
if you start looking for

552
00:30:33.690 --> 00:30:36.660
them, there isn't many, I
feel like remote is still

553
00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:40.140
the thing that is very,
very viable in the U

554
00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:42.630
S but if you are
from Europe or if we

555
00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:46.020
are from Asia or Australia,
that just becomes such a

556
00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:49.050
novelty and such a thing
that's difficult to do that.

557
00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:51.750
You have to overcome a
lot to make that work.

558
00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:55.680
I think that it's very
it's for lack of a

559
00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:59.310
better word it's foreign, right?
We don't know what's involved

560
00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:03.390
tax wise or monetary wise.
It's just, it's it's the

561
00:31:03.390 --> 00:31:06.540
unknown, isn't it? Yeah. There
are definitely a lot of

562
00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:09.540
costs involved, but also a
lot of gains because sometimes

563
00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:12.540
you don't have an HQ.
Sometimes it's just cheaper to

564
00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:17.190
hire elsewhere. There are just
many, many aspects of understanding

565
00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:22.440
what remote really entails. How
important is it that people,

566
00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:27.690
you know, either speak or
write extremely, you know, excellent

567
00:31:27.690 --> 00:31:30.090
English that they're will well
spoken and well, easy to

568
00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:34.800
communicate with? Hmm. I wouldn't
say I worked with, well,

569
00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:39.990
English is not my primary
language obviously, but I was

570
00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:43.290
working with people who had,
I would say intermediate English,

571
00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:46.110
and I was able to
communicate with them quite effectively.

572
00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:51.000
So I wouldn't discourage hiring
people who don't have perfect

573
00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.380
English. And, but I think
that communication skills are absolutely

574
00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:58.530
necessary and it's crucial that
they are really good and

575
00:31:58.530 --> 00:32:01.290
it doesn't really rely on
whether you're from us or

576
00:32:01.290 --> 00:32:05.580
English speaking country, because I,
I worked with some people

577
00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:08.460
who, you know, were native
and English and direct, terrible

578
00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:12.720
communicators. So I wouldn't say
like, that's, that's a definite

579
00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:15.630
if you're a, not from
that country, but it is

580
00:32:15.630 --> 00:32:19.890
definitely a super important, So
folks can find your medium
