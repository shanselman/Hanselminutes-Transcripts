sponsors, pay friends. This is
Scott Hanselman. This is another

13
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.340
episode of Hansel minutes. And
today I'm talking with Christine

14
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.420
Spang, she's the co founder
and CTO of Nylas and

15
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.610
a very long time, Debbie
and contributor. How are you?

16
00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.310
I'm doing great. I'm looking
at your LinkedIn and I'm

17
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.330
just blown away. You've been
doing a Debbie and for

18
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.150
now what? 11 years. Yeah,
it's a bit of an

19
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.170
interesting story. Debbie is kind
of a, it was instrumental

20
00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.980
in like how I got
into computing actually and how

21
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.620
I decided that I wanted
to be a software engineer.

22
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.240
The story kind of goes
a little bit before I

23
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.600
actually started using Devin. So
the reason that I ended

24
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.240
up using Debbie and in
the first place was when

25
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.870
I was in high school,
I got really into computer

26
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.910
gaming and I was really
interested in trying to find

27
00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.270
like the games that had
the fewest rules for like,

28
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.500
like stories that you had
to follow as possible. Because

29
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.100
I guess I kind of
wanted like to live in

30
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.250
another world and kind of
like explore, but I didn't

31
00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.040
want to have to like,
you know, do exactly what

32
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.970
the game creators told me
to. So that eventually led

33
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.240
me to playing these online
games that are multiplayer games

34
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:26.210
and they were text-based called
muds. Hmm. And how this

35
00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.510
ended up with me getting
into Debbie Lynn was after

36
00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.880
playing one of these muds
for a while. It was

37
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.090
actually a Lord of the
rings themed mud. I started

38
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.470
actually helping out run it
because they had basically administrators

39
00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.980
that helps kind of run
plots. And like this mud

40
00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.490
was very roleplaying focused. So
everyone had to spend a

41
00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.040
lot of time creating a
character or writing their description

42
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.040
and figuring out what their
backstory was and their personality.

43
00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.310
And then the admins would
have to like go through

44
00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.710
the use and approve the
characters before they went into

45
00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.340
the game to make that
it was, you know, a

46
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.150
kind of rich in theme
world. So I eventually became

47
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.290
one of these like roleplaying
administrators and those people would

48
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.320
like build areas of the
world and they would like

49
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.380
run storylines and parts of
the world and just kind

50
00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.410
of like make the world
come alive. But if you

51
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.500
were just a roleplaying administrator,
you were limited to kind

52
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.720
of using the tools that
existed in the game world

53
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.660
to create new things. Whereas
I kind of viewed that

54
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.320
there were lot basically like
two people on the administration

55
00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.730
team at this mud that
knew how to code. And

56
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.090
I pretty much viewed them
as having super powers because

57
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.990
they could actually change how
the game world worked and

58
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.790
like create entirely new things
that no one else had

59
00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.240
imagined before. So I really
wanted to learn to program

60
00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.450
in order to be able
to contribute to this game

61
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.890
world in a way that
I couldn't. So for one,

62
00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.730
the games code base only
ran a Linux. And so

63
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.980
my uncle used Linux and
he ran Debby in and

64
00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.790
he got my twin brother
into a running. And so

65
00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.770
I had my twin brother
helped me install Debbie in

66
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.100
on this, like, you know,
with those like tower computers

67
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.430
that people had back in
the day, Was it that

68
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.410
the white or the beige
one, the big giant one

69
00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.830
Mine was actually kind of
like dark gray. And I

70
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.290
think it was from like
comp USA or one of

71
00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:32.070
those like big box stores
that no longer exists anymore.

72
00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.360
So back in the day,
it was kind of a

73
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.550
feat to manage, to install
in alongside windows and not

74
00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:47.460
accidentally break your windows installation
because like the partition editor

75
00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.910
was like kind of like
no guardrails in some ways.

76
00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.950
So we were really excited
to have managed to install

77
00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:00.510
Debbie and on this machine
without breaking windows, because I

78
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.520
didn't know if I might
still need it. I might

79
00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.780
need to like do my
homework or something. You know,

80
00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.570
I was in, I was
in high school at the

81
00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.690
time. So it was a
little too risky to just

82
00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.960
kind of wholesale replace it.
Yeah. But you haven't needed

83
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.090
windows for 11 years, so
you probably can delete that

84
00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:20.100
partition. Yeah. In fact, on
my latest laptop, I, every

85
00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.110
time I buy a new
laptop these days, I just

86
00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.560
completely wipe it away though
with this recent one, I

87
00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.350
kind of a couple days
after doing that, I considered

88
00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.900
whether maybe I should have
kept it this time because,

89
00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:32.670
and I think we might,
it might be good to

90
00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:35.010
talk about a bit more
about this later. But as

91
00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.530
a CTO at a company,
I spent a lot more

92
00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:40.710
time talking to and working
with people who like are

93
00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.340
not programmers. And I worry
that maybe there is something

94
00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.160
that I might need windows
for to like, you know,

95
00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.090
deal with some obscure Microsoft
tools or something. But I

96
00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:55.050
just borrow someone's laptop when
that happens. Yeah. That's a

97
00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.130
good system. The thing you
didn't tell me though, is

98
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.980
that this is when you're
what, 14, 15, this is

99
00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.820
all happening. Yeah. I was,
I was like 15, 16

100
00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:09.880
at this time. So I
installed Linux and I started

101
00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.840
trying to teach myself C
because the mud server was

102
00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:18.460
written in C and a
C is really not the

103
00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:21.370
best language to learn as
your first language. I would

104
00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:25.960
not recommend it because, you
know, it's, it's really a

105
00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.520
pretty low level language. And
I remember, so I, I

106
00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.920
bought the like classic C
book, which is like the

107
00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:36.280
current again and Richie K
and book. And I remember

108
00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:42.370
reading it and there's this
chapter on pointers and I'm

109
00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:46.720
pretty sure I read that
chapter like three times because

110
00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.090
I just, I just couldn't
wrap my head around the

111
00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:53.080
idea of what a pointer
was. And eventually like, after

112
00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.260
spending enough time with it,
it sort of clicked, but

113
00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:00.100
I have very vivid memories
of it being very difficult.

114
00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:04.840
I have the same experience.
That's just pointers, pointers, pointers.

115
00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:06.490
And then at some point
it clicks and then it's

116
00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:12.100
like, Oh, okay, Mind mindblowing
as like not having background

117
00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:14.620
with a lot when it
comes to computing, just like

118
00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:17.650
having that be your intro
and being like, what's a

119
00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:23.650
memory address. Well, this is
pretty crazy Question aside kind

120
00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:25.840
of a sidebar question about
this, because this is interesting.

121
00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.540
So, so you and I
have very similar histories in

122
00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:31.240
that we were thinking about
memory and pointers and instruction.

123
00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:34.540
You know, that level, this
is what Maria on my

124
00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:40.540
team calls learning from the
metal up, but she says,

125
00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.580
and she's a little bit
younger than I am that

126
00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:47.500
she learns from the glass
of the monitor back, meaning

127
00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:49.780
she wants to go into
the browser and hit F

128
00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:53.260
12. And at some point
she just accepts that the

129
00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.410
abstraction is the abstraction. And
for her maybe JavaScript is

130
00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:59.050
the metal or maybe go
is the metal or Python

131
00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:02.470
is the metal. Do you
think that we come built

132
00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:06.310
in as a top down
or bottom up learner? Good

133
00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:09.760
question. I Like, do you
drive a stick shift? You

134
00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.980
know what I mean? No,
that was good. I don't

135
00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:14.050
drive a stick shift, but
I do know how to

136
00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:15.970
drive a stick shift. There
you go. And say, that's

137
00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:19.930
the thing, right? Yeah. Early
thought of that before. I'm

138
00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:23.470
not really convinced that like
either one of them is

139
00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:26.560
like the one true way.
Yeah. I'm one of those

140
00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.650
people who like knows how
to low level program, but

141
00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:33.640
have like the utmost respect
for high level programming, because

142
00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:38.050
it's not less complicated. It's
just complicated in different ways.

143
00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:41.710
So Yeah, someone told me
once that success is a

144
00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:45.190
pretty good metric. So if,
you know, if you don't

145
00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:48.250
know assembler, but you launched
Twitter, well, success is a

146
00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:52.090
pretty good metric, so, Yup.
Yup. I feel like it

147
00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:55.030
kind of like computing lore,
there's this like, and just

148
00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:58.740
the culture and what kind
of we value, like, there's

149
00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:03.120
this meet those in like
kind of low level, like

150
00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:06.900
close to the machine programming
and I'm a little skeptical

151
00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:10.860
of it as like a
measure of like how great

152
00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:13.820
a program are you are.
Yeah. Well, I don't think

153
00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:16.310
being a, this isn't about,
for me, it's not about

154
00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:19.040
being a great programmer. Like,
you know, everyone is, is

155
00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:21.950
different. It's more about what
is the best way to

156
00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:26.450
effectively get computing information into
a team and to a

157
00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:29.300
person. And the problem is
everyone's a different kind of

158
00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:35.390
learner, you know, here, audio,
audible learners, visual learners, people

159
00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:38.660
who read kinesthetic learners, you
know, not everyone wants to

160
00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:42.800
say, Hey, let's talk about
double pointers. Yeah. I guess

161
00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:44.780
I would kind of agree
that I like to kind

162
00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:47.660
of know the details and
abstract from there rather than

163
00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:51.080
the other way around though.
It's definitely the case that

164
00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:54.170
sometimes when you're like learning
a new thing, that's like

165
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:57.980
a new programming language or
a new framework. Like at

166
00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:00.920
some point you're going to
be in a situation where

167
00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:04.700
you almost have to like
deal with the fact that

168
00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:08.210
you don't understand what's going
on and like roll with

169
00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:12.650
it for a little while.
Well, and then at some

170
00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:14.750
point you have to decide,
okay, this car is not

171
00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:17.540
starting. Am I going to
open the hood? Or am

172
00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:19.760
I going to hire someone
to open the hood? Now

173
00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:23.270
you went to MIT after
this and then went on

174
00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:26.600
and worked on Colonel patching
at, at case splice, which

175
00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:30.440
is basically doing Linux security
fixes without rebooting. So what

176
00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:32.360
is that changing the engine
on the car while it's

177
00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:37.070
driving on the freeway? Yeah,
pretty much. Yeah. That's, that's

178
00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:39.380
definitely opening the hood and
then flipping the car over.

179
00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:43.850
Yep. Yeah. At MIT, my,
my favorite class was actually

180
00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:47.990
the operating systems class because
it just kind of made

181
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:52.370
me feel like a wizard,
like to like actually access

182
00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:56.210
the low level hardware. And
if you mess up your

183
00:10:56.210 --> 00:11:01.160
entire computer can crash. And
I don't know, I just,

184
00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:03.350
I just thought it was
the funnest thing to like,

185
00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:06.860
you know, inspect network packets,
like at the kind of

186
00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:10.160
packet level and kind of
make them go and like,

187
00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:13.340
think about the fact that
like data is moving through

188
00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:19.130
the hardware of, of this
machine. That's really exciting. Hi,

189
00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:21.170

Have you ever seen Julia Evans?

205
00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:28.020
So you want to be
a wizard programmers, EAN. I

206
00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:31.140
totally have. I, in fact,
I know Julia and she's

207
00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:34.500
amazing. She is amazing. And,
and the way that, that

208
00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:37.170
way of presenting information is
this, this is like a

209
00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:40.620
fun, cool. You know, you
have power, you are empowered,

210
00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:43.470
you are in control. It's
such a fun way to

211
00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:47.490
get people excited about computers.
Yeah. I mean, computing in

212
00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:51.270
general is just like kind
of an incredible feat of

213
00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:56.130
human ingenuity going from like
this abstraction. That's like high

214
00:12:56.130 --> 00:13:00.660
voltage and low voltage. And
somehow ending up with like

215
00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:06.900
these crazy information machines that
now allow us to automate

216
00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:13.830
things and like aggregate large
amounts of information, Not to

217
00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:17.130
mention that it's all so
broken and it still works.

218
00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:22.440
Yeah. I, I agree with
that. Having been for awhile,

219
00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:25.260
it's amazing that any of
this stuff works. Oh yeah.

220
00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:27.150
And, and I'm on a,
I mean, you know, I'm

221
00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:29.910
on an Intel machine running
windows and I haven't rebooted

222
00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:33.120
in, in 24 days and
maybe you're on Debby and

223
00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:34.980
on an AMD and you
haven't rebooted and I dunno,

224
00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:40.710
20 years, however long I,
yeah, I did actually log

225
00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:43.410
into my server the other
day and realized that I

226
00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:49.710
was two major releases of
Debby and behind. And if

227
00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:51.780
you know, Debbie and, you
know, they don't release very

228
00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:55.110
often. So it's like, it's
like a stable release every

229
00:13:55.110 --> 00:14:00.060
two years. So rarely updated
that server in about five

230
00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:03.900
years. So fast forward a
little bit, and you've gone

231
00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:08.010
from mud to hot patching
the Colonel, and then you,

232
00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:11.400
you decided to start a
company. And right now you're

233
00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:16.140
the CTO at Nylas that's
N Y L I s.com

234
00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:20.850
and I'm CTO. That's like
the sea level, that's the

235
00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:22.350
seat with this, where they
call that the C suite.

236
00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:26.880
Yeah, yep. Is kind of
a big deal, right? That's

237
00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:30.400
the year like on the
stock filings or whatever, but

238
00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:32.520
that, that doesn't sound like
the person who's patching the

239
00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:36.720
kernels. That sounds like a
business person. Yeah. CTO is

240
00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:40.080
interesting. I think it would
be useful to kind of

241
00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:42.390
give a little backstory as
to how I kind of

242
00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:46.980
ended up in this position
please. So even before I

243
00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:49.470
started the company, so I
was at, at this company

244
00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:53.450
case place doing like Colonel
and the founders of that

245
00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:55.910
company, or some people that
I met at MIT through

246
00:14:55.910 --> 00:15:00.950
the MIT computer club. And
after about a year of

247
00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:03.740
being at that company, the
founders sold the company to

248
00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:07.570
Oracle, says at Oracle for
a little bit. And it

249
00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:10.270
was like through that expense
that I pretty much came

250
00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:12.940
to the conclusion. This is
my first time ever working

251
00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:17.350
for a really large company.
And I didn't like it.

252
00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:20.230
And so I had been
thinking about like, what was

253
00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:22.630
going to be my next
step during my time at

254
00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:28.360
Oracle and ended up starting
this company with a friend

255
00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:32.140
of mine from college and
in the beginning, that's the

256
00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:34.480
split between me and my
cofounder. Michael was pretty much

257
00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:37.690
that like the product idea
was completely him. It was

258
00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:39.700
like based on something that
he had worked on as

259
00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:43.510
like his undergraduate thesis, he
basically been trying to build

260
00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:47.020
some stuff with email and
it was like, wow, this

261
00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:50.770
is a really difficult to
actually even access the data.

262
00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:54.520
Maybe this is why people
haven't been building new, innovative

263
00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:57.940
things that kind of work
with this core technology that

264
00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:01.960
like everyone uses, but no
one really loves. So he

265
00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:05.050
was always kind of the
initial product visionary in terms

266
00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:08.650
of like what problem we
were trying to solve. And

267
00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:11.860
I really joined as kind
of the like implementation chops

268
00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:15.820
where, you know, I was
doing like backend engineering and,

269
00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:18.970
you know, at case place
we had this huge VM

270
00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:22.210
farm because part of the
way the technology worked was

271
00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:25.180
that every time you were
like converting a source code

272
00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:29.650
patch to binary patch, you
actually had to compile the

273
00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:33.520
patch against every single old
version of the kernel that

274
00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:37.030
you were trying to update,
which was basically like every

275
00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:39.760
single kernel that had been
released by every single Linux

276
00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:43.150
Cicero out there. And that
meant there was basically like

277
00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:45.310
hundreds of builds that we
had to do for every

278
00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:47.950
single patch we were updating.
So we had this like

279
00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:52.990
pretty complex VM infrastructure that
automated kind of parallel building

280
00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:55.060
of all of these kernels
as fast as we could.

281
00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:58.480
And so it was a
really different front kind of

282
00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:02.050
product space for me to
like switch to like working

283
00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:05.350
on email. But I came
from like a backend engineering

284
00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:07.600
background. So it made a
lot of sense for me

285
00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:11.230
to kind of start building
out the sync engine that

286
00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:16.090
we use to sync data
with email servers and Michael

287
00:17:16.090 --> 00:17:17.890
pretty much like figured out,
like what was kind of

288
00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:22.720
the design of a kind
of the API and worked

289
00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:24.610
with some other folks that
were early on the team

290
00:17:24.610 --> 00:17:26.890
to do that. And I
was focused on kind of

291
00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:31.510
like the lower level infrastructure
and data storage and figured

292
00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:34.150
out kind of how we
were going to make it

293
00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:36.640
much easier for clients to
be able to kind of

294
00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:40.930
sync and brought all of
our kind of first infrastructure

295
00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:45.130
up and stuff like that.
So was definitely super, super

296
00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:50.220
hands on in the beginning.
And we really have titles

297
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:52.020
at the early days of
the company, you know, when

298
00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:55.290
you're, you know, like six
people in like a tiny

299
00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:57.780
office and you're all just
kind of working on building

300
00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:00.900
the product. It's not really
useful. I think of titles

301
00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:04.350
as being mostly useful for
like people outside of a

302
00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:07.020
company actually. And once you
get a company to a

303
00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:10.860
big enough size, it becomes
useful internally because people like

304
00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:13.620
don't know everyone super well
and they need to know

305
00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:16.710
what you do. And it
was, I think it was

306
00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:20.280
about like two years into
the company. Like people on

307
00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:22.890
the team just actually just
started referring to me as

308
00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:26.940
the CTO, which wasn't really
something that I had pushed,

309
00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:29.610
but I just kind of
rolled with it because I

310
00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:32.640
was kind of like acting
as like the lead architect

311
00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:37.800
for kind of the backend
and the term CTO can

312
00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:41.070
mean a lot of different
things I've found and like

313
00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:44.760
what that person does differs
a lot from company to

314
00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:48.330
company. And it's not that
weird for, at an, a

315
00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:51.630
very small, early stage startup
for the CTO to actually

316
00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:55.350
be kind of like very,
very highly technical and like

317
00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:59.760
doing some sort of like
architectural work on the actual

318
00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:03.330
product. So I think it
wasn't appropriate title for me

319
00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:08.040
at that point in the
company. And since then, I

320
00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:10.290
feel like I've kind of
grown more into the mantle

321
00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:13.440
of like what a CTO
does at a larger company.

322
00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:18.720
And that, that has been
actually like really good for

323
00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:22.110
me in terms of like
growth. I still consider myself

324
00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:25.710
to be highly technical and
people on the team actually

325
00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:27.930
like still send me code
reviews and stuff like that.

326
00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:31.320
So the company right now
is it's about 25 people

327
00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:36.510
and about half of that
is engineering, but my role

328
00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:39.900
has definitely changed a lot.
I'm not like writing code

329
00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:42.390
all day every day. And
I keep myself out of

330
00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:46.530
the critical path for kind
of shipping new features or

331
00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:49.440
like doing major projects. And
what I mean by critical

332
00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:53.700
path is that my work
on a project should not

333
00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:58.760
be a blocker to shipping
it. Yeah. Sometimes we talk

334
00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:01.160
about the bus factor of
a person. Have you heard

335
00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:04.400
that? Yeah. Right. Do you
get, what if Christine gets

336
00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:07.580
hit by a bus? Can
we still ship? Yeah. Even

337
00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:11.210
beyond the bus factor, like
bus factor can be like

338
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:13.580
does more than one person
know how this system even

339
00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:16.160
works. And there were definitely
points in the history of

340
00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:18.950
the company where I would've
been, it would've been really

341
00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:22.730
bad if something had happened
to me because there were

342
00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:25.010
things that like nobody else
understood. And there were other

343
00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:28.250
people in the company that
were experts on certain things

344
00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:31.790
and no one else really
understood and kind of as

345
00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:34.040
the person who's been there
from the beginning, and this

346
00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.560
is kind of like being
in charge of like the

347
00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:39.860
health of the backends. Like
I've been the one who

348
00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:43.460
has also like when people
have come and gone, made

349
00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:46.610
sure that like, we understood
how the code that they

350
00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:49.240
wrote and the other people
could, could work on it,

351
00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:54.310
but more so today than
like being not like critical

352
00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:56.980
to shipping your project, I
want to not be a

353
00:20:56.980 --> 00:21:01.210
blocker. And these days at
kind of, as the company

354
00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:03.790
has grown a lot, I
have a lot more meetings

355
00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:08.050
in my calendar then I
used to. And it's, they're

356
00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:11.020
kind of like these two
different modes of operating a

357
00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:15.400
if you've ever heard of,
I think Paul Graham wrote an

358
00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:18.220
essay about this it's like
maker mode and a manager

359
00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:21.850
mode where like, when you're
in like maker mode, you

360
00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:24.010
need like long stretches of
time. So you can get

361
00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:28.270
into flow. And you're like
working on building something, whereas

362
00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:31.120
like manager mode is like,
Oh, I'm like kind of

363
00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:34.330
like pulling myself out of
the details. And I might

364
00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:37.060
be like, kind of monitoring
how various different things are

365
00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:39.880
going. I'm like talking to
a lots of people. I'm

366
00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:43.750
communicating a lot. I might
be meeting with external people

367
00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:47.470
who are not kind of
actually employees at the company.

368
00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:51.190
And it's kind of hard
to switch back and forth

369
00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:55.480
between those two modes. And
if you're trying to do

370
00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:59.710
that, it makes the project
work those slower. And so

371
00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:04.120
it's also, I find it's
very enticing and that if

372
00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:08.560
I let myself do too
much technical work these days,

373
00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:12.430
I will neglect other things
that are very important. And

374
00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:15.550
I won't respond to emails
for a long time and

375
00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:19.500
as bad Are you concerned
that you would lose your

376
00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:22.560
technical ability after so many
years of being so technical?

377
00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:25.890
I definitely think about that
sometimes. Yeah. I'm kind of

378
00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:28.200
in this, in this point
where I would say that

379
00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:30.210
like most of my time
on a week to week

380
00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:35.040
basis is not like writing
code, but I still understand

381
00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:38.430
how all of our systems
work, my kind of help

382
00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:43.260
guide architecture. I'm like talking
one-on-one with the senior engineers

383
00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:45.840
on our team on a
regular basis helping kind of

384
00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:49.350
figure out what direction we
want to go in. And

385
00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:53.130
I also am still a
part of our rotation for

386
00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:57.000
like dealing with customer bugs.
So that kind of allows

387
00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.640
me to get my fix
of writing a little bit

388
00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:02.940
of code sometimes, and also
just kind of stay in

389
00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:06.900
touch with like, what are
the things that go wrong?

390
00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:11.580
And like, what are our
actual like customers experiencing? And

391
00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:15.810
so I'm able to like,
you know, write patches that

392
00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:18.480
fix things for that. But
I do find that like

393
00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:21.300
when I am the person
who's in that rotation, what

394
00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:23.970
it takes me like longer
to ramp up than it

395
00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:28.200
used to. And also because
there are some meetings that

396
00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:31.260
I like can't really like
put off or like not

397
00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:34.830
go to during the week.
I'm like not as effective

398
00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:38.580
as like a full time
engineer on that rotation. And

399
00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:40.770
it's something that like, I've
keeping an eye on at

400
00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:45.770
this point. But for me,
like, I've always about my

401
00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:48.920
role at the company as
like, what does the company

402
00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:51.530
need most from me right
now? And what's kind of

403
00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:54.740
the highest leverage thing for
me to be doing. And

404
00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:59.390
like, as a founder at
a company, you almost occupy

405
00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:02.150
a little bit of like
a, kind of like a

406
00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:08.270
spiritual symbolic role where I
actually, it was really important

407
00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:11.750
to me when we started
the company to focus a

408
00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:15.920
lot on the culture, because
doing a startup is one

409
00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:18.500
of the few chances that
you get to actually kind

410
00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:22.880
of start from scratch when
building how an organization works.

411
00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:27.260
And as a person who's
been here from the beginning,

412
00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:29.420
I view it as my
responsibility to kind of be

413
00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:32.690
the steward of that culture.
And as the company gets

414
00:24:32.690 --> 00:24:35.780
bigger, there's like more work
to be done with that.

415
00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:39.650
For example, we've been doing
this thing where we have

416
00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:42.890
basically like every six months,
we'll have a whole company

417
00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:47.270
offsite and talk about kind
of like high level strategy

418
00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:51.500
and like our company's values
and like the mission of

419
00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:54.050
what we're doing and trying
to accomplish and going after.

420
00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:57.110
And like for the last
one, I spent a fair

421
00:24:57.110 --> 00:25:00.410
amount of time preparing beforehand.
I use that as an

422
00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:03.260
opportunity to get feedback from
the team about what we

423
00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:06.590
like. And don't like, and
we have a open source

424
00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:09.380
handbook that we've published on
GitHub with kind of like

425
00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:13.010
our values and company policies.
And it's like a way

426
00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:15.830
to communicate both internally to
people who are joining the

427
00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:19.940
team and also to external
people who might be wanting

428
00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:22.400
to know more about us,
or even like other, other

429
00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:25.880
people who just like want
to get a great like

430
00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:30.890
parental leave policy and, and
just like, copy it. And

431
00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:33.470
so kind of revising that
and keeping it up to

432
00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:37.760
date something that's really important
to me because as you

433
00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:40.340
add a lot of more
people to a team, like

434
00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:43.490
they only know what you
tell them about how the

435
00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:48.680
company operates and what they
see. So like this communication

436
00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:52.040
of what's important to us
is like vital to kind

437
00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:55.930
of keeping the culture going
as the company grows. Well,

438
00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:59.170
you've kind of outlined the
D like there's, you've mentioned

439
00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:04.040
like lead developer than chief
architect or lead architect, and

440
00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:07.000
then CTO. And as you
Uplevel, I'm hearing you say,

441
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.630
as you Uplevel those things,
you're going from being the

442
00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:12.790
smartest person in the room
or being the technical one,

443
00:26:12.790 --> 00:26:16.690
or being the kernel patcher
to being the, the, the

444
00:26:16.690 --> 00:26:19.720
big picture person to being
the bridge between the business

445
00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:22.810
and the technology to being
a culture setter for the

446
00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:27.100
technology division of your company.
Yeah. And there's a few

447
00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:30.160
more things to it too.
Like for example, there was

448
00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:32.680
a point during the history
of the company that I

449
00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:37.630
actually managed every, every person
on the engineering team. And

450
00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:41.020
I had done a tiny
little bit of management before

451
00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:44.250
at Oracle though. I only
had two people who reported

452
00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:46.950
to me there. So it
wasn't really kind of a

453
00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:50.610
full, full management load, but
I at least got to

454
00:26:50.610 --> 00:26:56.040
practice a little bit. And
I would say that kind

455
00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:58.620
of like listening and empathy
is one of my strong

456
00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:03.420
points. And I really enjoyed
having an opportunity to kind

457
00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:09.060
of exercise that ability. And
I've found management is also

458
00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:11.760
like it's a different mode
of operating. And I think

459
00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:15.030
that, like I would say
that you have to think

460
00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:17.790
about it a little bit
differently to find it satisfying,

461
00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:21.360
but I found over time
that it has grown to

462
00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:25.230
be a thing that is
exciting to me. So the

463
00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:28.230
thing that I find exciting
about like building technology is

464
00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:31.590
like, kind of figuring out
all the details of like

465
00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:35.160
all the components and making
something that works, that allows

466
00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:37.980
you to do something that
you couldn't do before. And

467
00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:41.190
you can almost think about
building an organization in kind

468
00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:44.010
of the same way where
you have slightly different components.

469
00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:46.920
The components are people, but
more and more over time,

470
00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:49.560
I've like, I feel like
I've developed this ability to

471
00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:54.750
get excited about accomplishing things
like through other people, rather

472
00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:58.650
than like doing everything myself.
And it's also exciting to

473
00:27:58.650 --> 00:28:01.530
see like how much more
you can get done by

474
00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:05.940
kind of harnessing other people
and like creating like an

475
00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:10.680
organizational machine that is empowering.
And that makes it easy

476
00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:13.380
for people to like collaborate
together and do great things.

477
00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:16.710
So it's definitely been a
bit of a journey, but

478
00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:19.950
I'm excited about kind of
the organizational side of things

479
00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:22.740
too. And I think that
it's not like the natural

480
00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:26.040
path for everyone, but I
feel like it's working for

481
00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:29.130
me and that there's not
really anyone else at the

482
00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:31.980
company who could like occupy
this role in quite the

483
00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:35.430
same way. So I think
it's really important for kind

484
00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:38.120
of me to stick to
it. Oh, how often do

485
00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:40.940
you have to, or do
you have to posture a

486
00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:43.130
little bit and remind yourself,
maybe if you're talking to

487
00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:46.100
an investor or a business
person, like, how often are

488
00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:49.190
they going to say, Oh,
she's the CTO? Like, how

489
00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:52.100
often does that happen? You
know, I've never had anyone

490
00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:54.890
say that to my face
or like, Well, yeah, of

491
00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:56.750
course. I assume that it
would never, hopefully would not

492
00:28:56.750 --> 00:29:00.320
happen to your face Actively
like disconcerted, but I do,

493
00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:03.290
I do think about, I
come kind of a little

494
00:29:03.290 --> 00:29:06.050
bit delighted about the fact
that probably what I work

495
00:29:06.050 --> 00:29:08.330
at, walk into the room.
Sometimes it's like a little

496
00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:10.970
bit, a little bit shocking
to people and they're like,

497
00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.050
what you revel in that
a little bit. Yeah. Yeah.

498
00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:19.640
I mean, as like a
female founder and also like

499
00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:22.640
female, like CTO at a
company, there's a certain extent

500
00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:27.350
as to which just, just
existing is like changing the

501
00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:31.340
status quo a bit and
kind of like making tech

502
00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:35.270
more inclusive is also really
important to me. And I've

503
00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:37.820
definitely been in places where
I've like beat myself up

504
00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:39.920
a little bit, because I
feel like I'm not doing

505
00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:43.360
enough, but I just have
to kind of remind myself

506
00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:47.500
over time that like just
existing and like succeeding in

507
00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:52.110
this role is contributing in
a way. I think that's,

508
00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:54.330
that's a good way to
put it. I mean, you,

509
00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:57.180
you can talk about what
you're doing and you can

510
00:29:57.180 --> 00:29:58.920
spend all of your time
doing that, or you can

511
00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:01.920
do the thing you're doing.
And simply by being visible

512
00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:06.240
and bike kicking butt, people
will see that and, and

513
00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:09.600
people can go up to
nylon.com and Y L a

514
00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:12.690
S and I was able
to go, just scroll down

515
00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:14.520
a little bit where it
says developers first cause I'm

516
00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:16.710
a developer. And I was
able to try a live

517
00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:19.830
example of how the API
works and my terminal run,

518
00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:23.670
curl, and, and look at
messages just right there with,

519
00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:26.220
with curl or HTTP I
E or w get it's

520
00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:30.210
pretty slick. Yeah. Definitely check
it out. Yeah. Thank you

521
00:30:30.210 --> 00:30:32.820
so much for chatting with
me today. Sure. It's been

522
00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:35.220
really great. I really enjoyed
getting to know you a

523
00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:38.880
bit Scott and having this
conversation. Cool. We appreciate you.

524
00:30:39.210 --> 00:30:42.450

of Hanselminutes and we'll see
