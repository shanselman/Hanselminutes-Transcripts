and a front end developer.
How are you? Hi, I

16
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.310
guess, how are you? I
am very well and I'm

17
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.740
happy to be chatting with
you from so far away.

18
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.830
Thanks for coming on the
show. I'm checking out the

19
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:27.560
website for CSS comp ar.com.
This was the event that

20
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.290
you organized in August of
last year. How did it

21
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:36.260
go? It went great. We
have almost 400 attendees. It

22
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.410
was an amazing event. A
lot of people coming from

23
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.730
Africa, even from different countries
in Latin America. So it

24
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.820
was really nice. Yeah. And
when you put on an

25
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.550
event like this, you're doing
it as a nonprofit, but

26
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.970
I think sometimes what does
the, what does the customer

27
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.980
think or what does the
user think? Does the community

28
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.070
think that you're going to
get rich and famous because

29
00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.510
you made a conference? Well,
probably yes, you have not

30
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.160
many people would think that
way. Since at least we

31
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.090
don't have many of these
events. It's really difficult to

32
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.330
explain to the people what
goes behind doors when we

33
00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.470
make it sometimes, yeah, people
may think that we want

34
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.220
to make money out of
it. And especially since we

35
00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.610
actually charge a ticket because
that's what we need to

36
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.630
actually run it. So there
is kind of a misconception

37
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.770
sometimes about making number of
conferences and how you kind

38
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.510
of prove that it is
actually nonprofit. So you have

39
00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.880
to prove that it's nonprofit
and I've noticed that some

40
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.720
conferences do a better job
than others, about letting the

41
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.710
community know when a conferences
by the community and for

42
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.850
the community. You actually published
a by the numbers post

43
00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.810
where you explained everything from
how many tickets you sold,

44
00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.490
how many tickets you gave
away and even some context

45
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:05.340
about Argentina's economy. Yes, we
felt like there was a

46
00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.540
need for us to publish
that because it's a second

47
00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.870
time we make CSS scarf.
We didn't do that in

48
00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.250
the forestation because we were
like overwhelmed for like how

49
00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.210
much work we have when
we start planning. The second

50
00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.780
edition that just at the
very beginning, we actually said

51
00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.740
to ourselves, okay, we should
release the numbers because after

52
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.500
all we have nothing to
hide. And it will also

53
00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.730
explain the, the value of
the ticket for the people

54
00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.890
who are from winter Cyrus
and also from the people

55
00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.610
who are from United States or
Europe, where you have a

56
00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.620
very different price. So it's
really good to be able

57
00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.680
to explain for all those
numbers, what is going on

58
00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.710
in, in some economy, in
some country, how you can

59
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:57.210
make a great event with
the priorities, right? Like better

60
00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:04.080
city community without like expending
a lot, any script that

61
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.690
we can actually show it
to the people on people

62
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.000
really appreciate it. I wonderful
feedback. And this was nine

63
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.300
months worth of planning. So
you started planning in December

64
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.650
of 2017 and the conference
took place in August. And

65
00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.450
there's a couple of things
that are worth pointing out

66
00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.800
there. You make the comment
that the monthly salary of

67
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:31.710
a web developer in Argentina
might be $1,000. Yes. Usually

68
00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.660
they, the employees don't really
pay the ticket for, I

69
00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.250
mean, the employers don't really
buy the ticket fund for

70
00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.280
you. So it's out of
the money of the people

71
00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.280
to attend. We don't really
sell tickets to companies. We

72
00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.040
sell tickets to people. So
I sat with them from

73
00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.660
pockets and economy situation in
the country is pretty bad.

74
00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:59.970
There's the last year, the
worst 50% inflation's so planning

75
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.330
ahead and actually saving money
for an event is really

76
00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.560
complicated for the people in
an everyday basis. And you

77
00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.900
also pointed out something really
interesting, which I did not

78
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.990
even consider was that the
U S dollar at the

79
00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.890
beginning of your planning was
one us dollar was about

80
00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.790
19 Argentinian pesos. And then
just nine months later, it

81
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:23.850
was basically doubled that, which
must make it very hard

82
00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.660
to budget for an event.
Yes. And in fact, we,

83
00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.100
we are used to dollar
going up. We we've even

84
00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.740
plan for dollar going up
a little bit in December.

85
00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.710
We within a half that
in mind. So it was

86
00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.840
really huge amounts of inflation
last year. And it was

87
00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.050
so hard because we actually
made a mistake of saving

88
00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.980
the money from the ticket
sales in vessels. You don't

89
00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.080
do that. The nursing team,
you can say money in

90
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.690
festivals because then you will
lose a lot. So we

91
00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:57.520
have an issue with, with
the conference that lose a

92
00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:01.360
lot of money in the
middle because of that. Oh,

93
00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.580
you mean you put them
like in the bank, in

94
00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.790
the wrong currency so that
when the currency fluctuated, you

95
00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:10.270
had less money the next
day. Exactly. Yes. That was

96
00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:14.800
an issue. Yes. After all,
all the, the expenses, the

97
00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:19.570
flights, the hotel reservations, they
are all actually in dollars.

98
00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:23.860
That's a good point. Now
all the while you're also

99
00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:27.730
trying to get sponsors. So
you had Mozilla and Google

100
00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:32.770
and data art, all helping
you sponsor flights, hotel nights,

101
00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:35.350
and you had a clever
idea that maybe they would

102
00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:39.370
not give you the money
directly. Yes. And that was

103
00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:43.150
really great because we didn't
want to go through the

104
00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:48.250
hassle of like taxis and
all that. And after all

105
00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:51.790
the way we wanted with
money from a sponsors to

106
00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:54.730
be able to make the
event. So we proposed to

107
00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:58.660
the sponsors, Hey, can, can
you cover this flight? And

108
00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.270
they were glad to do
that. They were really excited

109
00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:05.260
that we were able to
provide the transparency in that

110
00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:09.580
way as well. Not them
giving us money, but partially

111
00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:13.390
them paying for the expenses
itself. So it was really

112
00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:16.150
good. And we had really
good feedback from a sponsors

113
00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.670
as well. That's a really
smart thing to do. And

114
00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:20.950
I was really impressed about
the level of transparency. I

115
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:23.620
feel like every conference should
do this. People I'll put

116
00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:25.780
this a link in the
show notes, but people can

117
00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:29.110
go and see exactly what
you paid for the venue,

118
00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:31.690
how much you paid for
it. You know, communication and

119
00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:36.190
talking to the, the people
who came paying for speakers

120
00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:39.100
to come and, you know,
paying for everything like you

121
00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:41.770
even put in like their
hotel, how much breakfast who

122
00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:45.340
was business class. He even
bought them Argentinian chocolates. And

123
00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.770
you kept track of all
of these costs. And it

124
00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:50.620
was really cool that you
put that on the thing.

125
00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:53.800
And then you said that
we have about $331 left,

126
00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:59.890
which is not exact, but
close. It took a lot

127
00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:03.460
of time, but I think
I really hope more conferences

128
00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:07.690
will actually work towards that.
Well, that's openness. I'm trying

129
00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:10.420
to spend a little bit
of time for making those

130
00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:13.570
two things open to the
community. So it's easier to

131
00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:17.920
understand the effort that goes
behind that. So it sounds

132
00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:20.560
like it was a great
conference, but it's a huge

133
00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:23.290
amount of work and it's
still a nonprofit. So will

134
00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:27.280
you do it again this
year? No, we need to

135
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:30.820
take some time. We need
to sleep that next year

136
00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:35.950
in 2020, we plan to
be back. Yeah, that's great.

137
00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:39.520
Yeah. I think that when
we, the public or the

138
00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:43.510
community attends a conference, we
appreciate all of your work,

139
00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:45.730
but I don't think we
really understand the amount of

140
00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:48.070
effort that's put into something
you could spend all year

141
00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:51.760
organizing a conference. It's exhausting.
Yes. And it's also really

142
00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:57.930
stressful. I mean, I saw
you have a product at

143
00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:03.810
$20,000 on your shoulders and
it's so much work and

144
00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:06.510
there are so many people
involved and it has to

145
00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:11.090
go, right. It doesn't have
to go wrong. Yeah. That's

146
00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:14.630
extremely stressful. So not only
do you organize the conference

147
00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:16.880
like this, but you also
are a professor at the

148
00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:22.270
national technological university in Argentina.
Yes. Yes. I haven't done

149
00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.680
that for a couple of
years. And what are you

150
00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:28.730
teaching? We are a teacher
frontend developer, and a little

151
00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:34.040
bit of backend right now.
So it's really nice. How

152
00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:36.770
much challenge do you have
when you're teaching web development

153
00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:40.730
to students that may have
different levels of English proficiency?

154
00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:46.730
A lot of challenge, because
on one hand and you

155
00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:49.820
have to suppose that, okay,
this is people who are

156
00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:54.350
writing in university. So you
have like this kind of

157
00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:57.530
supposition in your head that
they will have a good

158
00:09:57.530 --> 00:10:00.800
level of English because they
reach university. But the truth

159
00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:06.260
is that it doesn't happen
everywhere. Our languages Spanish at

160
00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:10.250
the same time, if you
go to public television, you

161
00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:13.280
turn on the television or
you even go to public

162
00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:17.120
channels and you put a
movie that will be in

163
00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:21.920
Spanish, you actually end up
like even watching friends, TV

164
00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:25.940
show in a Spanish. So
if someone gets to university,

165
00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:27.890
that doesn't really mean they
have a good level of

166
00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:32.900
English. And the harder thing
is that you have such

167
00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:38.030
a different buyer of levels
of English in upwards of

168
00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:42.500
2030 people. That is really,
really hard to know how

169
00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:46.100
much resources in English. You
can actually give them without

170
00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:50.450
being unfair to a lot
of them. How do you

171
00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:55.040
deal with that? Because someone's
skill level or someone's, let's

172
00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:58.670
just say their talent, their
ability, their inherent ability to

173
00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:01.970
be good at web development.
It doesn't necessarily need to

174
00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:05.600
be attached to their English
ability. There's lots of developers

175
00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:09.020
that are amazing developers, but
they don't have fluent English.

176
00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:14.000
Yes. It should never be
a barrier, but it is

177
00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:20.840
mainly because the majority of
intermediate to advanced content of

178
00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:23.810
what the abandonment and teaching
at the question on the

179
00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:27.230
staff is in English. It's
not in Spanish, it's not

180
00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:31.280
in Portuguese, in English. So
that is a big issue.

181
00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:34.580
What I usually try to
do, but it's not the

182
00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:38.870
solution, sadly, is to try
to give them something from

183
00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:43.130
perhaps MDM, Mozilla developer network,
because they have, I got

184
00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:48.740
a lot of good articles
with good translation. And even

185
00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:51.650
though sometimes the Spanish version
is a little out of

186
00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:55.070
date, but at you can
show them, okay. If you

187
00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:57.070
don't get everything that is
going to know, you also

188
00:11:57.070 --> 00:11:59.590
have this website that will
be able to help you.

189
00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:03.750
So do you think that
the, the right thing for

190
00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:06.060
people who are listening, like
we have, are people who

191
00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:08.940
are listening to this podcast?
My Spanish is not very

192
00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:12.180
good. Therefore, this podcast is
in English. What do you

193
00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:15.630
tell the listener? Should they
all go and make advanced

194
00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:19.620
technical content in their local,
late native language to help

195
00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:23.280
people? Or should we have
everyone learn English and improve

196
00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:27.300
their English? What's the solution.
I think that language is

197
00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:31.080
shouldn't be a barrier. And
I think that it shouldn't

198
00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:35.370
be a barrier for getting
a rice at your shop.

199
00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:39.540
So I feel like that's
on one side, we really

200
00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:45.960
need content in, in around
languages because of trying to

201
00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:48.990
bring out that career. But
at the same time, we

202
00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:53.290
also need content in our
own languages, simply because it's

203
00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:56.190
a culture and thing as
well. I mean, waking and

204
00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:59.880
showing within books in Spanish,
I enjoy it just because,

205
00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:01.920
you know, that's my language.
And I get along with

206
00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:06.690
really well, my chokes are
way better in Spanish, where

207
00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:10.200
they are in English. So
I guess it's also about

208
00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:13.680
spreading our culture and being
proud of the languages we

209
00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:17.160
speak. Yeah. I think that's
a good point. I think

210
00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:21.000
that, you know, there's the
joke about, I'd be, perhaps

211
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.540
you've heard this, right? If
you are trilingual, then you

212
00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:27.300
might be a European. Or
if you're bilingual, you speak

213
00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:32.310
two languages. If you're monolingual,
you're American, you know, I

214
00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:35.010
think we, we just assume
that everyone should learn English.

215
00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:39.360
And then we think that
maybe a computer translation is

216
00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.270
an okay solution. But I
think if it's not a

217
00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:45.360
good school, No. And I
have a really solid story

218
00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:50.370
about computers on installation. So
I was teaching gate one

219
00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:54.210
day at university and I
have to students who have

220
00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:59.010
good translate the extension in
the browser installed. So he

221
00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:03.510
went into the com and
he click on the translate

222
00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:07.050
bottom. So all the website
and that in Spanish and

223
00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:11.730
funny enough, not only the
website got translated, but also

224
00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:17.100
the code symbols. So suddenly
that poor student felt that

225
00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:21.990
get's ad was actually get
good. And he ended up

226
00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:26.160
writing it Spanish version in
the console, and that didn't

227
00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:29.760
work. I'm keeping a list
of why. So yeah. Automatic

228
00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:33.930
translation. No, no, it doesn't
really matter. Oh, that's awful.

229
00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:37.440
Yeah. I mean, if you're
mixing code and you're mixing

230
00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:40.770
pros, those things are going
to get translated. You're going

231
00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:44.250
to lose keywords. You're going
to lose context. And even

232
00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:47.580
if we think we're being
helpful by doing automatic translations,

233
00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:50.550
often, we're just going to
confuse the issue for people.

234
00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:53.720
You have to be really
careful And try to test

235
00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:57.370
it and be really sure
that it actually works. You're

236
00:14:57.370 --> 00:15:01.150
a very good developer, probably
regardless. You do write bugs.

237
00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:04.240
That's unavoidable. What is affordable
is wasting time trying to

238
00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:08.470
track down the cause of
those bugs century.io provides full

239
00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:12.010
stack error tracking, but lets
you monitor and fix problems.

240
00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:14.110
In real time, you can
see the severity and the

241
00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:17.140
scope of the error get
immediate access to the stack,

242
00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:19.810
trace, connect the problem to
the commit that caused it

243
00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:23.170
and fix it without delay
century. It's a name so

244
00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:25.420
common that they have to
include the top level domain

245
00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:29.410
in their advertising to make
sure you remember it. century.io,

246
00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:34.870
that's century.io, open source, full
stack, web apps, native apps,

247
00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:37.750
mobile games, smart oven mitts.
If you can program it,

248
00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:40.840
they can make it far
easier to fix any errors

249
00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:43.960
you encounter with it. Your
code may be broken. Let's

250
00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:48.820
fix it together. Visit century.io.
Now you can give and

251
00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:51.760
talks in multiple languages all
over South America, all over

252
00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:55.750
the world. You've switched kind
of smoothly between languages. Do

253
00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:59.470
you try to give advanced
talks to him to make

254
00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:02.590
sure that there's more advanced
content or are you focused

255
00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:05.440
more on beginner talks to
get more people involved in

256
00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:09.370
web development? No, it, it
also been sewn on the

257
00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:13.150
target on the audience and
where I am speaking. If

258
00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:16.930
I'm speaking at a conference
or a meetup, I usually

259
00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:21.520
give up advanced content because
the audience won't understand that.

260
00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:24.610
But if I'm teaching, I
just begin with a basic

261
00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:28.930
level because that's where my
students will understand. So it's

262
00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:34.960
a mix. Really? Do you,
your English is fantastic. So

263
00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:38.380
compliments on that. I I'm
curious though, what do you

264
00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:40.360
think about the fact that
there's probably a lot of

265
00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:43.870
people out there who have
great information, but because they

266
00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:47.710
don't have fluent English that
they are afraid to present,

267
00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.350
how do we get people
to present in their native

268
00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:53.290
language? Do videos do workshops
because I want to get

269
00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:56.320
that information outside into the
world, you know, put that

270
00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:58.300
good information out. So other
people can learn from them.

271
00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:03.160
That's something so important. And
I heard it a lot.

272
00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:06.130
Like people are kind of
ashamed of the way they

273
00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:09.370
speak or maybe of their
ask them and they, they

274
00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:12.790
know, want to, they are
afraid. People will make fun

275
00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:16.690
of them. And honestly, no
way. I mean, yes, big

276
00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:19.180
more than one language. You
should be proud of yourself.

277
00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:20.830
It doesn't about it. If
you have a little bit

278
00:17:20.830 --> 00:17:25.600
of facet and it's that
real thing, people have actually

279
00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:28.240
talked to me about that.
They told me no, I

280
00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:32.530
don't really feel like giving
a talk in international conference

281
00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:35.890
because my English is not
good enough. So you also

282
00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:38.530
have a focus on accessibility
and I know we've talked

283
00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:40.780
a little bit about language
and how language is a

284
00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:44.980
thing that keeps, keeps the
web from being accessible to

285
00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:46.780
people. But what are some
other things that you're excited

286
00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:49.740
about on front end development
to make the web accessible?

287
00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:54.090
Well, accessibility to something that
I began working on like

288
00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:58.440
three years ago where we
kind of recently, I think

289
00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:00.750
they go side by side
because it's, it's a way

290
00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:05.370
of opening up the <inaudible>
of the web of the

291
00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:10.230
internet to more people. They
shouldn't be it's another battery

292
00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:14.490
or that we should just
put down, help people actually

293
00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:20.030
get the information without any
issues You gave a talk

294
00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:22.490
and I'll put a link
in the show notes called

295
00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:25.100
the C is for accessibility.
What is the C what

296
00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:27.080
do you mean by that?
The C is for accessibility.

297
00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:31.100
That's really about choke. We
make him people who like

298
00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:34.610
CFS. We usually begin sentences
say in the C is

299
00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:38.150
for SK the style sheets,
but we totally change that.

300
00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:41.330
And the C is for
cats. So this is where

301
00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:47.240
accessibility is really, really bad
joke about it's all of

302
00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:52.790
how CSS impacts accessibility. It
does because people have so

303
00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:55.160
much power in their CSS.
It's one of the main

304
00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:57.530
tools that they have available.
But a lot of people

305
00:18:57.530 --> 00:19:01.910
don't realize how CSS can
impact contrast and visibility and

306
00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:05.810
pseudo elements. Indeed. People usually
think that CFS is the

307
00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:10.910
last thing on accessibility, that
everything is about HTML and

308
00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:14.180
Java script. And it is
about that, but also at

309
00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:17.180
display known when make a
disaster, if you've gone through

310
00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:22.040
it right in accessibility. And
you're talking your talk on

311
00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:27.170
accessibility about hiding about visually
hidden and semantically hidden. Maybe

312
00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:30.440
you can explain the difference
between those things. Yes. Well,

313
00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:35.420
when you initially heard something,
you are actually high, they

314
00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:38.770
need to only from what
we can consider the site

315
00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:42.290
as user, but you are
actually providing that content to

316
00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:47.870
the screen reader user, for
example, they skip navigation links.

317
00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:50.240
It's given them vacation links
or something that you put

318
00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:53.390
at the top of your
website. So they use about

319
00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:56.720
easy give or navigation. That's
I have to go through

320
00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:58.940
all the menu if they
want to get to the

321
00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:02.180
content. So they just click
on the, skip the vacation

322
00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:08.840
and jump into the main
content. That's great for non-sighted

323
00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:12.800
users, but also for people
who prefer cable navigation. So

324
00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:17.180
you can visually hide it
from common users and activate

325
00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:21.320
it and make it visible
for Coupa navigation and focus.

326
00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:24.650
So that would be an
use case of racial healing

327
00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:31.850
semantical here then will be
something like perhaps hiding the

328
00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:39.020
content from the user who
is not cited, showing it

329
00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:44.180
for the user who can
actually see that let's say

330
00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:47.410
an use case for that
would be maybe, and this

331
00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:49.780
is going to be a
really silly use case. But

332
00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:52.840
if you have an image
that the machine is not

333
00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:56.890
really important, so you just
hide it from the non

334
00:20:56.890 --> 00:21:00.490
side, the user, so they
don't waste their time on

335
00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:03.690
you show it to the
other kind of user. It

336
00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:05.700
makes sense. I actually, like
I have had times where

337
00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:07.590
I've put an image in,
but it might not be

338
00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:11.220
an image that is really
deserves an alt tag. It

339
00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:15.360
doesn't add any semantic value.
So I might want to,

340
00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:17.190
like, I don't want to
hide information, but at the

341
00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:19.200
same time, I don't want
to waste their time. Yeah.

342
00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:23.610
Yeah. Interesting. And a lot
of those things are, again,

343
00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:27.090
coming down to empathy, you
have to remember that people

344
00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:32.760
view or see the web
differently as a sighted user.

345
00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:36.120
I don't think I've ever
seen skip to main content,

346
00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:40.740
but a non-sighted user sees
that all the time every

347
00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:44.600
day. Yeah. And it's something
so important because when you

348
00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:47.790
start like practicing with a
screen reader or some with

349
00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:52.710
key for navigation, you're suddenly
began to realize how I

350
00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:55.830
know, and it can be
to browser web without a

351
00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:58.740
skip to navigation links, because
he has just got to

352
00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:01.590
go through each one of
the links in the navigation

353
00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:04.140
with your task giver. And
you're going to spend like

354
00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:06.630
half an hour pressing time
until you finally get to

355
00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:10.740
the content. You also point
out that the visual presentation

356
00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:12.900
or the order, the way
that we see the order

357
00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:15.510
of something sometimes because of
the way we've coded the

358
00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:18.750
website, isn't the necessarily the
Dom order. And that can

359
00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:21.600
be confusing to a screen
reader. Yes. Because you can

360
00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:25.620
actually change the order of
elements with if they sold

361
00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:29.250
their property in CSS. And
that will alter only the

362
00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:32.910
visual part, but it will
alternate the order. So if

363
00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:36.450
you tougher it, perhaps if
you are a sighted user

364
00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:39.930
for cannot use your hands
really well, and you say

365
00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:44.070
giver, then the navigation will
go perhaps the other way

366
00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:49.620
around. It's not necessarily wrong,
but it is confusing. Hmm.

367
00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:51.510
And I think that if
you had a form that

368
00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:55.260
had that problem, I know
that a non-sighted user would

369
00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:58.680
use their keyboard and they
could find themselves bouncing around

370
00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:01.200
the form and not understanding
what's going on because the

371
00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:04.080
order is not the same.
Yes. So is this something

372
00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:06.630
that this seems overwhelming as
a person who is a

373
00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:09.330
kind of a full stack
developer, it seems like you

374
00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:12.060
would really need a dedicated
team or a dedicated person

375
00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:14.940
to keep track of all
these different things. I know

376
00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:17.220
I'm going to get it
wrong if I, if I

377
00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:19.920
don't have a dedicated team
for accessible. Yeah. I mean,

378
00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:25.650
it makes companies, I think
it's almost compulsory if we

379
00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:28.500
can. I mean, if you
can afford an attraction half

380
00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:30.420
of, then they tried to
team, and if you are

381
00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:34.530
in a small company, hopefully
you will hire a front

382
00:23:34.530 --> 00:23:37.800
end developer for that small
to only do like Preact,

383
00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:41.130
but also accessibility. Do you
find that this is something

384
00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:43.980
that you focus on, like
exclusively or are you just

385
00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:47.120
have a list of stuff
that you have to get

386
00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:48.530
done on the front end
and you do the best

387
00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:52.870
you can and just continuous
improvement. I do try to

388
00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:55.630
do the best that I
can in everything that I'm

389
00:23:55.810 --> 00:24:00.220
thrown out, but I do
focus on accessibility and I

390
00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:05.310
also try to do educate
my, my team work in

391
00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:08.670
the company. I work on
accessibility. So in the end,

392
00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:10.780
I, I try not to
be the only person who

393
00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:14.800
can solve accessibility issues. One
of the things that I

394
00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:17.290
like about your talks and
the things that I think

395
00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:19.630
make your talk special and
we'll have links, of course,

396
00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:21.550
to the videos of your
talks in both English and

397
00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:24.070
Spanish, is that not only
do you do live coding,

398
00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:25.750
which I love to do,
I do a live coding

399
00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:27.970
in my talks, but I
think that you also put

400
00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:32.740
things in context, in historical
context, how important is it

401
00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:35.710
for new developers and the
developers that you teach at

402
00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:39.220
the university that they understand
the history of? Why something

403
00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:44.080
is a certain way? Oh,
well, I show it to

404
00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:48.460
know why things are the
way they are. So I

405
00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:51.340
think it comes like natural
that I actually tried to

406
00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:54.940
explain the history of why
this is happened. Is this

407
00:24:55.090 --> 00:25:00.570
thing happening? I do the
same when I teach. I

408
00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:03.790
think there's really a reason
more than I like to

409
00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:06.400
do that. I, I like
to know why this is

410
00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:10.180
happening. So I like to
explain it. I, I just

411
00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:13.240
call people with show the
history of, of things as

412
00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:16.540
much as I do. There's
just an overwhelming amount of

413
00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:19.690
things to know. If you
think about like someone starting

414
00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:23.890
today, if someone this morning,
anywhere in the world, maybe

415
00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:26.110
in Latin America, maybe somewhere.
So I'm going to be

416
00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:28.960
a web developer. There's so
much to know there's the

417
00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:31.660
history there's maybe they need
to know. And a certain

418
00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:34.870
amount of English, where do
you send people? How do

419
00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:38.110
you even start on day
one of class one? Wow.

420
00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:45.430
It's like an overwhelming experience.
Let's see. When we go

421
00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:48.280
to dress one in, in
the course that I teach

422
00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:53.710
at university, it's actually a
completely theoretical and not practical

423
00:25:53.710 --> 00:25:57.910
class because I just began
talking about the history of

424
00:25:58.030 --> 00:26:04.990
interrupts. How, how, for example,
speed connection, sexually improve websites.

425
00:26:06.550 --> 00:26:09.310
I think that's the way
of begin and is trying

426
00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:12.490
to understand how we got
here in kind of mess.

427
00:26:12.550 --> 00:26:16.030
We have right now with
so many technologies. And at

428
00:26:16.030 --> 00:26:18.820
the same time, it's just
straight to really teach good

429
00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:23.260
basis and then give good
resources to the students. And

430
00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:26.260
they can keep on researching
after the course, if they

431
00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:30.520
want to. And they can
actually make themselves experts in

432
00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:35.260
a certain area In your
blog posts. And in your

433
00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:38.890
demos, you use a lot
of code pen. You like

434
00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:42.970
have nice clean HTML and
nice clean CSS. And when

435
00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:47.070
I learned, and when I
was teaching at university many

436
00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:50.580
years ago, view source was
a big part of my

437
00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:53.940
life. And sometimes I see
something amazing and I do

438
00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:57.750
a view source and I'm
sad that it's a mess.

439
00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:02.210
Yeah. I, with you, I
think that, you know, performance

440
00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:04.760
is good, but if we
are taking it too far,

441
00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:09.920
I really began, like I
began like expect elements and

442
00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:13.280
view source and try to
understand how something is made.

443
00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:16.100
And it's really sad when
you cannot do this anymore,

444
00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:19.340
because everything is kind of
compressed in the cycle of

445
00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:27.080
maybe quite kilobytes of coal.
So I really like that.

446
00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:31.010
Yeah. It's extremely frustrating. Even
when I'm doing an inspect

447
00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:33.770
element, I feel like I'm
digging through a bunch of

448
00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:36.560
dibs, get things out of
the way. Cause I really

449
00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:39.260
want to see how they
built this. I'm the web

450
00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:43.590
somehow became a thing that
we decompiler and compile and

451
00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:49.280
as opposed to learn from,
yeah, that's overwhelming. Another thing

452
00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:51.260
to point out that last
year, you put out an

453
00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:56.210
SVG animation with JavaScript class
at Pluralsight. How have you

454
00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:59.400
found learning and how people
learn as, because you, you

455
00:27:59.450 --> 00:28:01.490
would do videos, you speak
at a conference, you do

456
00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:05.060
a Pluralsight, and then you
also do university classes. Which

457
00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:08.000
of those has you found
the most effective way for

458
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.990
someone to learn web development?
I, I am a strong

459
00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:17.720
believer of people having different
ways of learning. Like I

460
00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:21.380
can learn. I learn a
lot with someone teaching me,

461
00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:25.760
like in person, maybe I
don't learn anything. If I

462
00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:28.520
want to read a book
of programming, I don't really

463
00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:31.910
get anything I'm really bad
at reading books. So I

464
00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:35.600
believe that the best way
for me is having someone

465
00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:38.270
to teach me in front
of me, but it differs

466
00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:41.030
a lot. And depending on
the person, and I guess

467
00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:43.820
that's, that's the most important
thing, because if you can

468
00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:48.380
provide content on learning tools
in those different ways, then

469
00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:51.110
you can get more people
to learn more like silly,

470
00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:54.410
like, okay, you feel, you
feel learn better by reading

471
00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:57.770
them. This is a book.
If you learn better by

472
00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:01.430
press in a class with
a person in front of

473
00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:03.650
you, you can do that
as well. Yeah. You've got

474
00:29:03.650 --> 00:29:05.900
a great blog post on
your kind of tips and

475
00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:08.960
tricks clues on how to
teach and learn web design.

476
00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:11.630
And the first thing that
you say is don't say

477
00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:15.320
something is obvious because it's
really only obvious to you.

478
00:29:15.530 --> 00:29:21.290
Yes. That's, that's something really
hard. I mean, sometimes in,

479
00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:25.250
in their name, because we
are really used to like

480
00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:28.430
writing code and it works
on the set, but for

481
00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:32.480
someone who has factually beginner
and it can be so

482
00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:37.550
overwhelming, so many tools, so
many codes and perhaps not

483
00:29:37.550 --> 00:29:40.910
even the coding, the language.
So you have to be

484
00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:47.020
ready comfort with Your language,
20 worse in each situation

485
00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:50.230
to about making someone feel
like they are stupid. One

486
00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:53.930
day they are just learning.
Yeah. And when, and when

487
00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:56.230
you pick that correct word,
I assume that you are,

488
00:29:56.290 --> 00:30:00.070
you're teaching in Spanish at
the university in Argentina, but

489
00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:03.520
you're bouncing back and forth
between English and Spanish. How

490
00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:06.180
much time do you spend
defining English words or giving

491
00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:08.530
or, you know, how do
you know which word is

492
00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:10.900
the correct word to use
as you are really being

493
00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:15.070
bilingual? Because you're teaching them
another language, CSS or HTML.

494
00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:18.460
I don't think there's a
right answer to that. That's

495
00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:22.450
probably the answer, his question,
try to do my best.

496
00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:26.230
And I find myself many,
many times saying that we're

497
00:30:26.290 --> 00:30:30.910
in the wrong language, like
an embarrassingly amount of time.

498
00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:34.060
Well, I'm certainly not wanting
to speak because I gave

499
00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:36.130
this, I did this whole
interview with you in a,

500
00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:40.690
in a, in English solos.
Well, thank you so much

501
00:30:40.690 --> 00:30:43.000
for chatting with me today.
Thank you for having me.

502
00:30:43.390 --> 00:30:45.130
I'm going to put links
to all the show notes

503
00:30:45.130 --> 00:30:47.410
so you can go and
see Eva's website. She, the

504
00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:49.690
videos and the slides of
the different talks that chief's

505
00:30:49.690 --> 00:30:52.690
given. And you can certainly
follow her on Twitter. This

506
00:30:52.690 --> 00:30:55.570
has been another episode of
Hansel minutes and we'll see

507
00:30:55.570 --> 00:31:16.650
you again. <inaudible>.
