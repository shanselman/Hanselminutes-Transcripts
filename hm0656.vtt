Hi, this is Scott Hanselman.
This is another episode of

16
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.510
Hansel minutes. And today I'm
talking with Jenny Shen and

17
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.060
she's calling from a you
in Holland right now. Yes,

18
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.340
I am in Holland. And
you live there right now.

19
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.440
I live in Amsterdam. How
long have you been in

20
00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.310
Europe? I have lived in
Amsterdam for about three years

21
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.850
now. Huh? And when I
look on your website, it

22
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.400
says that you are an
independent UX and product designer,

23
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.480
but you're Canadian and you've
worked in many different countries.

24
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.490
You've traveled all over the
globe. You're almost like a

25
00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.410
digital nomad. Exactly. That's how
I tell other people. I'm

26
00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.920
a digital nomad. Did you
decide that one day you

27
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.300
said I'm going to have
a business. I'm going to

28
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.060
be an independent and I
will use my business to

29
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.600
travel the world Actually, it's
more like it was a

30
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.630
dream and it was a
goal cause I've met what

31
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.820
wide I was in the
intern. I met other people

32
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.070
who do that and I
just thought it was such

33
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.080
a cool career. And I
want to do that in

34
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.240
the future. So I kind
of actively work towards getting

35
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.330
to that goal. And here
I am, that's fine. Fantastic.

36
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.850
I'm looking at your about
page and it's just full

37
00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.060
of international speaking and you're
all over Europe and you're

38
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.090
doing workshops. You're you seem
like you're not just a

39
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.240
UX and product person, but
you are a global one.

40
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.810
You focus on design for
everybody. And I think that

41
00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.850
a lot of us really
just designed for our local,

42
00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.350
our local audience. Yeah, I
think I am very, I'm

43
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.860
lucky to have the opportunity
to be able to move

44
00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.340
several countries and also have
server client trust me to

45
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.260
design for Jews more than
their local country. So I

46
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.870
really love what I do.
I've looking at an arm

47
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.050
at our talk that you
gave about building bridges, not

48
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.810
walls and designing for users
across cultures. It says that

49
00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.280
you've traveled to nearly 50
countries, lived in six and

50
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.530
work with users from, from
27. That's basically everyone. That's

51
00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:00.280
almost everyone. Yeah. Yeah. So
it's, it's just kind of

52
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.860
like what I've been doing
for the past few years

53
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.270
and I'm lucky to be
in this niche and I

54
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:12.370
find it so interesting to
design for international users, localization

55
00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.350
like these, this kind of
cross cultural experiences, user experiences

56
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.830
really fascinates me. Now I've
done basic internationalization. That's when

57
00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.190
you see like I, the
number 18 and N which

58
00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.550
is, you know, like remembering
that German words are longer.

59
00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.750
So making room for them
and you know, Chinese and

60
00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.860
Japanese, you know, Kanji as
smaller things will shape and

61
00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.070
layout differently. But when you're
talking about UX design across

62
00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.370
different cultures, it's not just
changing strings right now. It's

63
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.540
not, it's more like be
aware of the, not just

64
00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.370
the character Lang the more
about how does culture actually

65
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.430
affect the user experiences. And
in my talk, I give

66
00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.020
examples about how an interface
for the Netherlands and the

67
00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.710
neighbor germy can actually have
a difference and then also

68
00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.190
interface in Japan or China,
how does that different from

69
00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.970
the interface of the West?
So those kinds of examples

70
00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.570
where people don't really research
or think about, and I

71
00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:19.650
just talk about that in
my talk. Yeah. I understand

72
00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.240
that you referenced Yaakov Nielsen's
book international user interfaces, and

73
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.840
there's a great quote that
says it's not simply enough

74
00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.960
to offer a product translated
to 10 or 20 languages.

75
00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.950
Users want a product that
acknowledges their cultural characteristics and

76
00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.370
business practices. I think I've
just been changing strings in

77
00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.030
a text file all this
time. I guess it would

78
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.150
be to be fair people
don't really know. There's not

79
00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.990
really like official courses that
teach people how culture affects

80
00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.440
user experiences. I also didn't.
I also didn't learn that

81
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.190
when I studied interaction design,
it was more like when

82
00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.340
I travel and when I
design for the local audience

83
00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.460
and I realized, Hey, there's
actually a big difference. So

84
00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.600
I wanted to reference that
a book, which is a

85
00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.310
by like authors that most
people in UX know about

86
00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.370
to say that, Hey, this
is something that's very important.

87
00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:20.580
That's kind of bring more
awareness into that. Yeah. In

88
00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.730
a number of your, your
blog posts and blog posts

89
00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:28.140
that you've pointed to you
reference actual studies. Like these

90
00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:32.160
aren't necessarily opinions as they
are like practical scientific studies

91
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.700
or formal studies. For example,
one professor said that there's

92
00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:41.730
six aspects for cultural differences,
power, distance, Power, distance mass,

93
00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:46.500
you get a lot of
the amenity individualism and There

94
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:53.010
was uncertainty, avoidance, verbal orientation
and indulgence and call out

95
00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:56.900
one really interesting comparing Kaiwan
with the U S yeah.

96
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.720
Yeah. So In, in that,
in that chart, you can

97
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:05.060
actually see how in host
data, Pollock dimension dice, the

98
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.390
cultural dimensions, how the U
S is different from Taiwan,

99
00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:11.470
which is actually the country
that I'm born in. Hmm.

100
00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.650
And it says here that
in the U S individualism

101
00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:19.540
is very important while in
Taiwan, longterm orientation is important.

102
00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:23.920
What is longterm orientation? So
longterm orientation is how the

103
00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:29.050
user kind of perceive or
changes the action in order

104
00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:33.100
to do stuff in, in
order to do stuff that's

105
00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:38.470
more for longterm purposes. And
you usually link that to

106
00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:43.360
saving or, or instead of
making sure 10 decisions, people

107
00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.690
make longterm decisions. So that
how I, how that can

108
00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:53.980
affect the user interface might
be that price sensitivity or

109
00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:58.270
any sort of decisions related
to shorten and longterm and

110
00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:01.870
Taiwanese users are more likely
to choose it for the

111
00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:05.980
longterm benefits instead of short
term, like instead of instant

112
00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:12.910
gratification users where countries have
high longterm orientation scores tend

113
00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:16.360
to choose it for the
longterm benefits. Interesting. So like

114
00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.520
I literally, you know, a
couple of hours ago was

115
00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:22.630
looking at my banking on
a, on like mint.com, which

116
00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:25.210
is like an Intuit product.
And it's very much like

117
00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:28.440
my budget and my financial
future. And my like, it's,

118
00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:32.050
it's, it is very individual
focused, but it's also trying

119
00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:34.300
to get me through budgeting
for the next month. There's

120
00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.940
not a lot of how
will my family be in

121
00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:40.690
10 years type of planning.
It seems to line up

122
00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:43.000
exactly with what you were
saying it's designed for a

123
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.850
United States person. Yeah. So I
don't design that much in

124
00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:52.090
FinTech, but I assume this
is kind of my assumption

125
00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:55.840
that perhaps in Asia, the
banking will kind of give

126
00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:59.290
a user the yearly overview.
Maybe they will be more

127
00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:04.030
services towards saving for their
children, saving for their grandchildren.

128
00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:06.430
And more like a long
term investment plan. This is

129
00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:09.460
just a guess, but I'm
trying to make, make this

130
00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:13.000
make sense for the listeners
who are trying to understand

131
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.530
what's a difference of longterm
and short term orientation. Right.

132
00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:19.120
Right. I think that the
point is that it's an

133
00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:22.930
educated guess to say that
these are in fact how

134
00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:27.220
different cultures, you know, juxtapose
how they're different. It's, it's

135
00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:29.440
clear that Taiwan is different
from the U S and

136
00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:33.220
how people, you know, go
about and move about their

137
00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:36.430
lives. And then if you
compare Taiwan with another country

138
00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:37.900
or the U S with
another country, you would see

139
00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:40.990
different axes. So it sounds
like sometimes you would have

140
00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:44.230
to create an almost entirely
different UX depending on what

141
00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:51.880
your, your market Exactly. Yeah.
About a, a map from

142
00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:57.240
Erin Meyer that talks about
the axes emotionally expressive versus

143
00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:02.480
unimpressive and confrontational versus avoiding
confrontation. Yup. So Aaron, a

144
00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:05.060
culture map is it's a
great book and it talks

145
00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:10.910
more about, we'll talk more
about how culture affects international

146
00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:15.560
teams, more in a sense
of teamwork and management instead

147
00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:18.890
of how to affects the
interface. Oh, interesting. So you

148
00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:22.790
are applying these workings, not
just to the actual UX

149
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:26.090
and the UI user interface,
but also to the teams

150
00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:28.040
that you work with as
you travel around the world.

151
00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:32.980
Exactly. So recently I work
with international teams and there

152
00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:36.080
are distributed teams where there's
members from the U S

153
00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:39.470
from Hong Kong, from Poland, from
UK. And I have to

154
00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:43.850
pay attention to the subtle
called the subtle deed where

155
00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:47.780
members of the UK are
more, a little bit more

156
00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:50.540
indirect. So I have to
be more careful when giving

157
00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:55.070
feedback to the designers in
UK and versus who my

158
00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:58.280
main clients in a U
S. And they actually prefer

159
00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:01.280
if I just talk about
the design points, but a

160
00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:03.980
more of a quote unquote
American way, like, you know,

161
00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:07.130
the sandwich way of giving
feedback, it's like, good, not

162
00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:09.320
so good and good. So
I kind of have to

163
00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:12.950
pay attention to the person's
culture and then how I

164
00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:16.640
could work with them more
effectively. How does one, when

165
00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.860
doing this kind of research
or reading about this kind

166
00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:22.250
of research, make sure that
they're not picking a stereotype,

167
00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:25.310
like how can one make
a generalization and say, yeah,

168
00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:28.670
that's generally true. For example,
this says that I'm just

169
00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:31.910
going to pick a country
that people in Spain are

170
00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:35.660
more confrontational and more emotionally
expressive than people from the

171
00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:39.560
U S that doesn't feel
like it's a bad thing.

172
00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:43.550
It's simply a statement of
a generalized perspective, but if

173
00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:46.370
it goes too far, then
it's a stereotype. Of course,

174
00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:48.620
yeah. That's a really good
questions. And I think that's

175
00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:51.500
something to be aware of.
And even, I sometimes make

176
00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:56.540
mistakes in making stereotypes instead
of more understanding about culture.

177
00:10:57.050 --> 00:11:01.160
So my understanding of how
to not make stereotypes is

178
00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:05.300
to be aware of, for
example, in the culture, Mavs,

179
00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:10.370
like Spanish could be more
emotionally expressive, but doesn't mean

180
00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:13.490
that they are emotional. Does
that mean that they are,

181
00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:18.050
for example, linked to more
negative adjective, then that is

182
00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:22.850
more towards stereotype. And for
example, it's assuming that Spanish

183
00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:26.330
users will then do about
this. Then that could be

184
00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:30.650
a stereotype, but to use
a more general statement that

185
00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:35.150
according to this data, according
to Erin mayor's chart and

186
00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:40.250
research, because planners users are
emotionally expressive. So we should

187
00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:43.880
allow a way for Spanish
user to express themselves, instead

188
00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:46.910
of trying to not let
them come back to each

189
00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:51.050
other, is this, it doesn't
make sense. Do you see

190
00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:54.370
there's a difference, right? It
sounds like, you know, culture

191
00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:57.580
Affects how you feel about
something like an error message

192
00:11:57.580 --> 00:11:59.500
about how you feel about
an avatar, how you feel

193
00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:02.320
about the way a company
talks to you. Like you

194
00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:05.380
gave an example of a
project you work on that

195
00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:09.550
was for a Dutch company
called travel bird, where you

196
00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:13.450
change the layout of a
form because of the Dutches

197
00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:17.700
kind of pragmatic nature. Exactly.
Yeah. So that was a,

198
00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:21.870
the example that I give
for Netherlands versus Germany. So

199
00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:26.220
that's last actually, how being
pragmatic and having high scores

200
00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:30.750
in longterm orientation can actually
affect the interface. I assume

201
00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:32.970
that you can measure this,
right? Like, like someone might

202
00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:36.150
be listening and feeling uncomfortable
if they're American or Dutch

203
00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:39.420
or Spanish, but at the
same time you can AB

204
00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:43.230
test these things, can't you?
Yeah. So a lot of

205
00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:47.190
these changes are actually based
on research. So we're not

206
00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:51.480
saying that every single Dutch
user loves discounts or every

207
00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:56.910
single German user needs details.
Of course, sometimes culture is

208
00:12:56.910 --> 00:13:02.670
very broad and, and there's
also cases where people like

209
00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:05.730
me, like, can I be
categorized as Taiwanese? Can I

210
00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:08.910
be categorized as Canadian? Not
exactly because I have kind

211
00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:12.060
of multiple backgrounds. So there
are cases where user does

212
00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:15.480
not identify with a culture
and that's okay. We're just

213
00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:18.570
saying that when we AB
test, when we have qualitative

214
00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:21.990
and quantitative data, the results
that we see is that

215
00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:26.010
this kind of pattern works
better for people in this

216
00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:29.370
country or people off this
culture, but not necessarily everyone.

217
00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:33.810
Okay. So again, when you're
designing, you recognize that these

218
00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:38.070
are generalizations, but every culture
is different and people cross

219
00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:40.980
multiple cultures. So you have
to be prepared to, to

220
00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:46.200
AB test and maybe be
surprised. Exactly. Exactly. Okay. So

221
00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:48.060
then if you are a
surprise with that, I assume

222
00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:50.190
that you need to, you
know, measure and be prepared

223
00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:53.340
to change quickly and don't
want to make assumptions. Yeah.

224
00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:55.740
So that's kind of what
I advocating the talk is

225
00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:58.980
that be prepared that a
users may not react well

226
00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:02.280
to a UI UX pattern
that they've been using for

227
00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:06.180
several years and be prepared
to AB tested and also

228
00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:11.160
research what works better for
their users. A big thank

k.com/hanselman. I mean, if someone's

245
00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:13.310
listening and saying, wow, you
know, I do business in

246
00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:16.130
five, six countries. I'm not
going to make a custom

247
00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:19.820
site just for the Germans.
Is it more about looking

248
00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:22.940
at specific touch points within
their UX and modifying just

249
00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:28.720
those? So the difference of
internationalization. So what you just

250
00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:33.940
described earlier I 18 N
versus localization, L 10 N

251
00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:39.550
is that internationalization kind of
takes account of all of

252
00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:43.700
the differences within the demographics
started deer going to, to

253
00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:47.110
target like Germany and, you
know, multiple countries in Europe

254
00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:51.280
and coming out with a
system that kind of is

255
00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:55.600
able to, is able to
satisfy it and all, and,

256
00:15:56.380 --> 00:16:00.940
and like, for example, having
good name fields and whatnot,

257
00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:07.870
but localization is specifically making
a custom design for that

258
00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:11.440
particular country in order to
achieve the best effect. So

259
00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:15.670
whether to go with internationalization
and localization is a business

260
00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:19.330
decision like Facebook, for example,
they are in Dropbox, they

261
00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:22.660
are going after internationalization because
they know they want to

262
00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:25.840
target. They want to serve
all of the users in

263
00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:28.180
this world, but they are
not going to make a

264
00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:32.860
custom designs for users around
the world. But for us

265
00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:37.540
above, for other companies, they
choose localization because they actually

266
00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:41.170
really want to target us
booth a few specific market,

267
00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:46.060
and they want to maximize
return on investment in those

268
00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:48.940
markets. Okay. So let me
see if I understand that.

269
00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:55.240
So internationalization is a, you
know, removing barriers to international

270
00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:59.320
deployment, making sure that the,
the text is all local,

271
00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:03.910
but localization is more adapting
the product to the local

272
00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:07.720
target market. It's more specific
than just swapping out the

273
00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:14.140
text. Yeah. So I cannot
speak more about internationalization because

274
00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:17.290
I don't study in that
area before, from what I

275
00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:21.940
understand, it's about knowing, knowing,
and studying, for example, all

276
00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:25.180
of the addresses in the
world and kind of coming

277
00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:29.260
up with a general address
form that will suit every

278
00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:33.220
type of possible address. For
example, it could have two

279
00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:37.120
address lines instead of zip
code, equal use postal code

280
00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:41.290
slash zip code slash whatever
term that they research and

281
00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:44.530
makes sense for a lot
of users across the world.

282
00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:48.940
To me, that is internationalization,
but localization is like the

283
00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:52.380
in Indonesia is like this.
So when the user is

284
00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:56.700
coming from Indonesia, we use
Indonesian address format, but when

285
00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:00.810
a user is American and
we use a American address

286
00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:03.950
format. Okay. That makes sense.
So localization, like if we

287
00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:07.460
look at the <inaudible> dot
org, the W3C, they say

288
00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:12.140
that localization is that real
comprehensive thinking of the way

289
00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:14.720
that you do things being
really focused on a given

290
00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:17.300
locale. So I like that.
Yeah. You could just make

291
00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:19.610
a double text box and
say, yeah, type your address.

292
00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:21.470
It's fine. We'll just put
it in a free text

293
00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:24.020
box, but localizing is going
to require a lot more

294
00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:27.350
work, but it might also
make a happier user. Yeah,

295
00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:30.740
Yeah. To me, I feel
like that's where I want

296
00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:33.140
to focus my effort. I
want to contribute to the

297
00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:35.990
happiness of the user, filling
out the form because of

298
00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:39.020
forums have been localized. Right.
Well, and you pointed out

299
00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:42.710
something else that I found.
Absolutely fascinating. I assumed that

300
00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:46.790
I cannot gruffy and emojis
were somehow becoming a standard,

301
00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:49.970
like for example, the hamburger
menu, like I figured, you

302
00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:52.280
know, I talked to my
spouse and my children, they

303
00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:54.440
don't know it's called the
hamburger menu and they just,

304
00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:56.810
they, they know that if
you click three lines, something

305
00:18:56.810 --> 00:19:01.070
happens. But did you point
out that there's different icons

306
00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:03.380
in different countries? Like they're,
they don't use the hamburger

307
00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:05.630
menu as much in China,
they use a different icon.

308
00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:10.610
Exactly. So while the hamburger
menu makes sense to us,

309
00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:14.330
that working and does those,
that kind of live in

310
00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:16.850
a Western society. So in
that, in my talk, I

311
00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:20.870
point out that in China,
what's more common is a

312
00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:26.750
discover icon with, with a
compass image where it users

313
00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:29.120
learn to click on it
or tap on it, to

314
00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:34.220
discover more options. And that's
more appropriate for the context

315
00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:38.060
of an Asian society because
people don't make the association

316
00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:41.480
where three lines equals hamburger,
but of course they might

317
00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:44.480
be users in Asia who
are using a lot of

318
00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:47.570
Western apps. And then they,
they actually know the three

319
00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:51.290
limes equal to more options
or the menu, but sale

320
00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:56.750
in China specifically, they don't
use that interface pattern. And

321
00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:59.140
you also point out kind
of as a general, a

322
00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:03.710
generalization that typing Chinese takes
a long time. So finding

323
00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:06.530
the perfect word or precise
word isn't as easy as,

324
00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:10.760
as browsing to the right
location. Yeah. So that's something

325
00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:14.770
where a design strategist at
Mozilla has discover and as

326
00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:19.910
actually his own assumption on
coding, his assumption. Yeah. That

327
00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:26.480
was from his research into
why do the Mozilla Firefox

328
00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:29.570
on page look different for
the U S and the

329
00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:33.650
China and China, where they
use a more newspaper style

330
00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:38.030
dashboard looking a homepage portal
design compared to the U

331
00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:41.660
S where it's very minimal,
very sleek. There's only one

332
00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:47.800
call to action. So his
assumption was that perhaps because

333
00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:50.410
typing Chinese, we need to
find a precise word. And

334
00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:54.190
there's literally like thousands of
word for just one pronunciation.

335
00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:57.430
It's could be easier if
we just allow the user

336
00:20:57.430 --> 00:21:01.150
to choose and click whatever
they see interesting, instead of

337
00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:04.300
asking the user to type
in what they are looking

338
00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:07.000
for. And I also feel
like it might be related

339
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.980
to the individualism cultural dimension,
because this is my assumption.

340
00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:15.610
Perhaps the Western user wants
to determine they want to

341
00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:18.760
choose for themselves. What is
it that are searching? What

342
00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:21.400
is it that they are
doing? But the Asian users,

343
00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:24.820
perhaps they are okay to
be guided with options so

344
00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:27.430
that they can just click
and browse instead of deciding

345
00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:29.890
for themselves, what is it
that they want to search

346
00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:32.700
and not saying that Asian
users don't search by, and

347
00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:36.600
this is just kind of
my educated guess, But it's

348
00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:39.900
also something that you can
potentially back up with anecdotes

349
00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:43.920
and experience, like, for example,
your point that like Americans

350
00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:47.250
or Western society likes a
lot of white space and

351
00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:50.100
a big text box that
kind of Google empty page,

352
00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:52.800
or being empty page with
a picture. While if you

353
00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:56.040
go to like Taobao, it's
quite busy. It's almost like

354
00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:59.220
Yahoo 10 years ago with
a lot of texts. And

355
00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:02.340
a lot of, like, it
seems like a fair statement

356
00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:05.400
that the Chinese seem to
appear to like a lot

357
00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:08.040
more texts, a lot more
information on the page as

358
00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:11.610
a design style. Yeah, exactly.
And when I point out

359
00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:15.180
the two differences and people
are actually a bit shocked

360
00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:18.900
that how is it that
a lot of interface in

361
00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:24.510
Asian society looks so to
us cluttered busy, overwhelming that's

362
00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:28.050
somebody's opinion, mostly from the
Western society, but to the

363
00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:32.220
Asian user, they actually comfortable
with it because some people

364
00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:35.640
could think, well, if today
I see a blank page,

365
00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:38.070
how do I know where
to start? Like, how do

366
00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:41.370
I know what to type?
Like I rather just let

367
00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:44.100
you give me the options
and I can just determine,

368
00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:46.800
I can just know what
are the top five news

369
00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:49.500
I must read today? What
are the top five people

370
00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:52.410
I must follow so on
and so forth. That's really

371
00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:55.410
interesting because it's funny that
we all think of the

372
00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:57.810
internet as being this global
thing and everything should be

373
00:22:57.810 --> 00:23:01.140
the same everywhere, but I'm
sure that you shop at

374
00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:03.060
a Dutch furniture store. And
I would shop at an

375
00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:06.090
American furniture store and we
eat at different places. The

376
00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:10.290
S the, the, the aesthetic
of a Scandinavian furniture or

377
00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:12.960
interior designer is going to
be fundamentally different from an

378
00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:16.230
American, from a Japanese or
Chinese. Why would they all

379
00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:20.070
want the same design on
a website? Yeah, exactly. That's

380
00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:23.160
a really good point. No,
I'm realizing though that it

381
00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:25.170
would also be very challenging
for Facebook to have an

382
00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:27.780
entirely different design, but at
the same time, now I'm

383
00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:31.320
realizing I'm quite surprised that
a Chinese, you know, Facebook

384
00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:34.080
was in China. It should
be quite a bit busier

385
00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:35.970
if it was going to
cater to their audience, if

386
00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:39.540
it was going to be
localized versus what you pointed

387
00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:44.580
out is that it's really
just internationalized. Yeah, exactly. So

388
00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:48.080
it sounds like should research
those Local UI patterns and

389
00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:51.050
apply those, and you've put
together a whole ton of

390
00:23:51.050 --> 00:23:54.620
information on, on your different
medium posts. And we'll make

391
00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:57.320
sure that we link all
of this in the, in

392
00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:59.690
the show notes. You also
point out that when you're

393
00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:03.140
doing this research that creating
a persona to describe who

394
00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:06.620
that local user that has
value to like invent kind

395
00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:09.430
of a person and talk
about what they expect. Well,

396
00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:14.050
technically a persona. It is
when somebody is inventing a

397
00:24:14.050 --> 00:24:18.640
persona, it's a portal persona,
but in a ideal UX

398
00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:23.200
process, the persona should actually
be researched and validated because

399
00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:27.040
we could imagine what a
South African user will do

400
00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:30.130
and feel, and what's their
goals and frustrations and needs,

401
00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:35.320
but without actually validating these,
these is just, I'm kind

402
00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:40.180
of imaginary persona. That's probably
going to steer us more

403
00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:44.860
towards designing for stereotypes. So
while personas is a valuable

404
00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:49.090
tool in a UX process,
like I will advocate for

405
00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:52.180
validating and actually talking to
these user to make sure

406
00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:56.470
that one's assumptions and guesses
are correct. Okay. So, so

407
00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:59.620
make an assumption, but do
it with research back it,

408
00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:03.250
up with research and thought
as opposed to being lazy

409
00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:06.070
and coming up with just
a stereotype, and then assuming

410
00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:08.650
that that's how a, a
Dutch person or Spanish person

411
00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:13.390
behaves online. That's right. Interesting.
And you're almost like creating

412
00:25:13.390 --> 00:25:16.600
a characteristics card, like a,
like a Dungeons and dragons

413
00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:19.570
where it's like this person
values easy and fast and

414
00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:21.550
cheap, and this person values
this, this and the other

415
00:25:21.550 --> 00:25:25.180
thing. Yeah. So it's funny
now that you mentioned it

416
00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:30.070
in some personas, I do
use sort of a, those

417
00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:33.790
kind of matrix. Do they
value, like, do they value,

418
00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:36.670
speed? Do they value like
ease? Do they value like

419
00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:39.550
whatnot? And now that you
mention it, I think it's

420
00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:43.420
interesting if we could put
cultural dimensions on it, for

421
00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:46.420
example, like, do they value
longterm decision? Do they value

422
00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:52.630
like family? Do they value
the collectivist societies input that

423
00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:56.560
could actually affect the personas
a lot. Yeah. And you

424
00:25:56.560 --> 00:26:01.570
also point out the importance
of using diversity and inclusion

425
00:26:01.570 --> 00:26:04.540
in even your creating of
these persona faces. You know,

426
00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:07.570
it's really easy to go
and search for a generic

427
00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:13.270
face and end up with
quote unquote with default. Yeah.

428
00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:17.230
So it's something that I
encourage everyone to do. Encourage

429
00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:21.430
all of the designers is
to, is to look up

430
00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:26.350
multiple cultural faces and like
diverse users. If today one

431
00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:30.730
is designing international product, then
make sure that the avatars

432
00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:33.880
are not just people of
that demographic and not people

433
00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:36.880
of the same gender, because
I see actually a lot.

434
00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:39.280
I mean, it's a simple
idea. It's a simple thing

435
00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:41.440
to do, but when I
go on dribble or when

436
00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:44.940
I check someone else portfolio,
I see all the avatars

437
00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:48.180
are just people of the
same race, people that look

438
00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:51.540
like they know each other.
So something that people who

439
00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:55.110
design international product have to
be aware when we put

440
00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:59.340
diverse avatars, diverse faces in
our product, it's more easier

441
00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:04.950
to imagine these users are
using our product. So therefore

442
00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:07.380
we kind of are a
little bit more aware of

443
00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:10.620
their needs compared to if
we just use avatars of

444
00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:14.630
the saying, I'm saying races,
say nationalities. Yeah. And I

445
00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:17.630
think that those things seem
kind of obvious, you know,

446
00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:19.190
to, to a certain kind
of person, but at the

447
00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:22.160
same time, if you don't
see your face represented, you

448
00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:26.300
can feel excluded something I
noticed today, actually my 13

449
00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:29.840
year old just got his
first phone and he's just

450
00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:31.700
begun to learn how to
use the phone and text

451
00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:35.150
his friends. And I asked
him in text, how do

452
00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:37.940
you like the phone? And
he texted me an emoji

453
00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:41.870
thumbs up. And I, and
it was Brown because my

454
00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:44.450
children are, my children are
black. And I said, Oh,

455
00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:47.720
your, your thumbs up is
a Brown finger. I said,

456
00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:49.340
how did you figure that
out? He says, Oh, well,

457
00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:53.000
it's my finger. Right? So
you didn't want it to

458
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.060
be just a peach colored
finger or a yellow finger,

459
00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:59.210
like the Simpsons. And he,
he did it entirely on

460
00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:00.980
his own. And I thought
that was cool. So he's

461
00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:03.650
quietly and on his own
without even thinking about it

462
00:28:03.650 --> 00:28:05.810
without, you know, he's a
little kid, he's not thinking

463
00:28:05.810 --> 00:28:08.570
about diversity and inclusion. He
just wanted the thumbs up

464
00:28:09.050 --> 00:28:11.360
to look like his thumb,
which I thought was pretty

465
00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:14.930
cool. Yeah. Yeah. That's, that's
thank you for sharing that.

466
00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:17.850
That's a really interesting, like
how to them is the

467
00:28:17.850 --> 00:28:20.990
default. It's not just like
an extra option, but when

468
00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:23.900
we think about other products,
like there are so many

469
00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:28.430
that don't kind of cater
to international audiences and we

470
00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:32.060
are experienced the frustration where
they don't see their default.

471
00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:36.140
They don't see their finger
color in there. Hmm. Yeah.

472
00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:38.690
I think that, you know,
someone who is maybe not,

473
00:28:39.670 --> 00:28:42.110
it doesn't appreciate inclusivity or
diversity in, they say, I

474
00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:43.410
don't worry about it. It's
just a finger. Right. It's

475
00:28:43.410 --> 00:28:45.320
just a bit pick, pick
the one that looks like

476
00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:52.340
the Simpsons may not realize
that without any coaching, both

477
00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:56.090
my, my wife and my
sons have just picked the

478
00:28:56.090 --> 00:28:59.090
one that looked like them,
which I thought was interesting.

479
00:28:59.090 --> 00:29:01.910
Cause I never taught them
that, which, which kind of

480
00:29:01.910 --> 00:29:03.800
made me happy because now
he's going to grow up

481
00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:05.690
in a world where, you
know, he can't pick the

482
00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:09.770
avatar or the video game
character that that looks like

483
00:29:09.770 --> 00:29:13.640
him. Yeah. That's great. Well,
you've put together a whole

484
00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:16.730
series of links to all
sorts of research and I'm

485
00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:19.550
going to include links to
your medium posts in the

486
00:29:19.550 --> 00:29:21.980
show notes. And I appreciate
that in all of your

487
00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:25.220
writing, you include a lot
of links out. It sounds

488
00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:26.780
like people have a lot
of research that they need

489
00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:29.360
to do to learn about
this stuff. Yeah. Yeah. I

490
00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:34.520
think the research there's really
a lot to do because

491
00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:37.550
I mean, I just designed
for users of over 25

492
00:29:37.550 --> 00:29:41.500
countries, but they're actually like
something like one 69 countries

493
00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:43.450
in the world. And I
think I'm not even doing

494
00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:46.210
enough. I'm not designing a
lot of users in certain

495
00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:49.870
regions on, because I'm mostly
approached by clients from certain

496
00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:54.730
countries. You can imagine. So
definitely it errors. There's a

497
00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:57.430
lot for us to do
a lot to learn, but

498
00:29:57.430 --> 00:30:00.550
then the resources in my
talks and in my medium

499
00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:04.320
posts are, it's a start.
And I understand that you

500
00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:08.280
also do do mentorship, but
of course, as you are

501
00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:11.550
a, an independent right now,
you do charge a little

502
00:30:11.550 --> 00:30:16.230
bit for your mentoring, your
mentoring services. Yeah, I do.

503
00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:19.590
So I'd be mentoring kind
of part time for more

504
00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:22.350
than a year now. And
it's being really great to

505
00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:26.490
see how my mentees have
grown to learn, to improve

506
00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:29.700
their portfolio, get more confident
in the job search and

507
00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:33.360
even moving abroad to do
what I have done before.

508
00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:37.650
And yeah, it's been, it's
been really great to, to

509
00:30:37.650 --> 00:30:40.200
be a mentor actually. So
that's great. You're not just

510
00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:43.980
mentoring on product design and
UX, but also on how

511
00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:47.580
to potentially be a digital
nomad. And it appears also

512
00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:50.820
that your mentorship is quite
formal. You can set, you

513
00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:53.790
know, for six months plan
there's homework, that's tailored to

514
00:30:53.790 --> 00:30:57.030
their growth. It really inspires
me to maybe make my

515
00:30:57.030 --> 00:31:02.070
mentorship experiences more formal. I
guess it's up to the

516
00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:05.300
mentor because each person have
a different teaching style. He

517
00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:08.180
used to be less formal
than that. But then, then

518
00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:11.880
later I realized like after
a year I was looking

519
00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:15.870
at their goals and I
have, I help have I

520
00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:19.890
contributed to their successes. And
I realized that for me,

521
00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:22.470
like my teaching style, it
will help if I would

522
00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:24.960
actually talk to them about
their goals and then formulate

523
00:31:24.990 --> 00:31:27.570
a plan for them instead
of they are the one

524
00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:30.000
to be proactive and asked
me questions that they think

525
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.350
about because the, the risk
is that they don't know

526
00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:36.570
what I don't know. And
if they don't know what

527
00:31:36.570 --> 00:31:38.580
they don't know that I
am, I should be, the

528
00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:40.950
mentor should be to want
to actually teach them the

529
00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:44.550
mentees, what they actually should
know. So that's, that's kind

530
00:31:44.550 --> 00:31:49.530
of why I personally have
this more formal structure, two

531
00:31:49.530 --> 00:31:53.280
approaches mentorship. Fantastic. Well, thank
you so much for chatting
