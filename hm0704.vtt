Sick of waiting for your
CIA test to pass or

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.660
having to manage different CII

to 1500 engineers while keeping
their build times under five

12
00:00:40.650 --> 00:01:01.130
minutes, that's built kite.com/hanselman. Hi,
this is Scott Hanselman, Hansel

13
00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.610
minutes today. I'm speaking with
Dylan Bennett, also known as M

14
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.550
often on the internet. He's
an educator and the author

15
00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.950
of game development with the
Pico eight. How are you,

16
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.860
sir? I'm doing well. How
are you? I am very

17
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.840
well. I have been learning
all about the Pico eight

18
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.940
and the folks who are
listening to this episode might

19
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.470
want to go back in
time and listen to the

20
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.800
episode we did with Joseph White
on the Pico eight fantasy

21
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.070
console. They can learn even
more, but as I started

22
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.040
learning about game development, I'm
just finding you all over

23
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.640
the place, the Portland indie
game squad and on a

24
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.530
website called itch.io. What does
itch.io? It started out as

25
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.460
a publishing site for independent
game. Developers makes it really

26
00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.870
easy for pretty much anyone
to publish is whatever they

27
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.560
want. And without having to
get in the way with,

28
00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.420
you know, things like getting
approval by steam and, you

29
00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.340
know, go through a lot
of hoops and you can

30
00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.120
fully adjust, you know, how
much, what percentage goes to

31
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.270
itch versus what percentage goes
to the developer. Things like

32
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.300
that. That is very clever.
So it's not steam, it's

33
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.960
an open marketplace and it's
really for independent creators with

34
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.450
the focus of course, on
an independent games. That's right.

35
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.580
So you can, anyone can
sell anything up there. It's

36
00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.400
almost like Etsy for video
games. Yeah. And you can

37
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.140
set it up to be
a pay what you want.

38
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.680
You can hook it up
to Patrion for example, and

39
00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.360
make certain things, you know,
open to patrons or the

40
00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.960
general public. And w I
talked about Pico eight, this

41
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.360
fantasy console that did, you
know, it doesn't exist. You

42
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.300
physically can't touch it unless
you build your own. Why

43
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.900
is, why do Pico eight
game makers find themselves so

44
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.900
often on edge that, Oh,
I think it's because it's

45
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.320
just so easy. It's you
can go right from making

46
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.190
a game and minutes later,
you have it published up

47
00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.290
on a page that has,
you know, it's basically its

48
00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.430
own storefront for that game
really in minutes. That's amazing.

49
00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.710
And you also have your
game development with Pico eight

50
00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.640
stored up as well. So
people can go and buy

51
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.110
this a 72 page book
effectively. You call it Azine

52
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.540
about doing game development. And
then you can, like you

53
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.610
say, you can pick your
price. You recommend, you know,

54
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.320
I don't know. I think
you would recommend, I think

55
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.120
I paid you 15 bucks,
but you can also pick

56
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.670
nothing if you are a,
a, a student or someone

57
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.780
who can't a candidate. Yeah.
I put it up there

58
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.660
because I want to make
it accessible to anyone. If

59
00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.350
they would like to contribute,
then they're absolutely welcome to,

60
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.560
I appreciate your contribution, but
I want to make it

61
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.050
available for anyone who just
wants us. You know, I

62
00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:32.760
want to learn how to
make games and this will

63
00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.280
get you started When, when
I go and search for

64
00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.010
game development and I've done
this with my sons and

65
00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.980
other young people, I often
find myself in places like

66
00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.580
unity and, you know, I
love unity and I've even

67
00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.400
had folks from like mano
on my show, but it

68
00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.850
seemed frankly a little bit
overwhelming. Like, it doesn't feel

69
00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.330
like there's an easy hello
world. I totally agree. That's

70
00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.360
one of the things that
spurred me to make this,

71
00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.620
or in make educational tools
for game development using Pico

72
00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.580
weight was because there's very
little setup and ramp up.

73
00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.220
It's, you know, you get
a blank canvas and you

74
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.250
can just start typing things
in and run it and

75
00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.350
immediately see something and get
something back. There's, you know,

76
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.230
there's not a big framework
to learn. There's not a

77
00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.530
lot of, you know, language
constructions that you have to

78
00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.110
learn. You just can kind
of sit down and just

79
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.910
get started. It feels though,
like, as I'm exploring Pico

80
00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.570
eight, that a lot of
people who may be more

81
00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.350
advanced, more advanced than my
11 year old, like to

82
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.440
fit things in like a
tweet and it comes off

83
00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:47.850
looking like almost like minified
code. Yeah, yeah, No, absolutely

84
00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.760
not. I mean, that's kind
of, one of the things

85
00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.790
about constraints is people like
to push a constraint as

86
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.700
far as they can. So,
you know, when you add

87
00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.190
Pico eight, which has its
own constraints, you know, like

88
00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:03.210
128 pixels by Hernan 28
pixels, certain number of, you

89
00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.190
know, colors, things like that.
And then you add on

90
00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.680
the further constraint of now
it has to fit in

91
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.420
a tweet. People will really
do some amazing things to

92
00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.870
pack as much as they
possibly can into that tiny

93
00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.410
amount of code space. Okay.
So if I'm getting used

94
00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.960
to this, or this has
been my introduction and maybe

95
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.230
copy pasting from a tweet
into the Pico eight editor

96
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.510
is my first introduction to
game development. I shouldn't let

97
00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.480
that slow me down. Oh
yeah, definitely not. That's these

98
00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.780
are almost pieces of art
in themselves in terms of

99
00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.570
coding to pack in as
much as they can. It's

100
00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:38.670
kind of similar to the
demo scene that was around

101
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.270
for quite a long time
in our early days. Okay.

102
00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.520
A lot of kids right
now are learning JavaScript and

103
00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.430
learning Python. That seems to
be, those are the two

104
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.340
languages that people jump into
when they're in their tweens

105
00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.850
or in their teens. Do
you prefer Pico eight as

106
00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:55.500
a place for a new
person to start learning to

107
00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.940
program as an introduction, let's
learn to program step one,

108
00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:03.220
Pico wait. Yes. And no.
It's uses a language called

109
00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:07.480
Lua, which is, it's a
great language and it's relatively

110
00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:11.170
easy to learn and understand
what's happening with it. It's

111
00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:14.710
not as widely used as
a Python or JavaScript or

112
00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.450
other languages like that, but
it does allow you to

113
00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:24.250
learn the basic fundamentals of
what makes programming work. And

114
00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.790
that I feel is more
important than the language itself.

115
00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:32.200
Is it full Lua or
is it just the basics?

116
00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:35.440
Because when I see games
in, in Pico eight, and

117
00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.990
as I looked through your
Xen, it's pretty much like

118
00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:42.940
variables and tables, which appear
to be like late bound

119
00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:45.550
objects or late bound hash
tables of some kind. And

120
00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:48.910
that's basically it loops and
ifs and it could be

121
00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:52.000
any language. Yeah, it's, it
is a subset of lieu.

122
00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.670
It's not the full Lua
language. And it also has

123
00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:59.320
a little bit of extras
added in by Joseph in

124
00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:02.410
terms of making it more
functional for making games and

125
00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:06.040
specifically for Pico eight. So
it isn't the full Lula

126
00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.860
language, but I've had quite
a few students who have

127
00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:13.030
started off knowing absolutely nothing
about programming and ended up

128
00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:16.840
loving the subject and going
on to new, do many,

129
00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.780
many more things just because
they were able to get

130
00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:24.100
their head around how programming
works using this simple system.

131
00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:28.720
Hmm. I like that your
tutorial. And again, this tutorial

132
00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.330
is available up at <inaudible>
Datto and I'll make sure

133
00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:33.820
that we have links in
the show notes in just

134
00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:37.090
72 pages. You can walk
through it in an afternoon

135
00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:39.550
on a Saturday or Sunday
and just have a real

136
00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:43.720
thing running at the end.
It builds so quickly though,

137
00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:46.870
you start with, you know,
effectively hello world. And by

138
00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:50.230
the end, you're moving stuff
around. When does it really

139
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:52.690
like make the big move?
Like when does it, like,

140
00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:56.740
when does the, the hockey
stick begin? Because you know

141
00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:59.740
what I'm saying? Yeah. Well,
that's something that I've found

142
00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:03.670
is a tough thing. Just
in terms of teaching coding

143
00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:07.510
in general, there's so many
fantastic resources for, you know,

144
00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:11.620
beginning learning coding, and, you
know, they have this really

145
00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:15.400
nice, easy, shallow ramp up
to learning coding. And some

146
00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:19.150
of those materials are absolutely
fantastic. Like the hour of

147
00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:23.170
code materials that many, many
people have put out, but

148
00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.630
they kind of leave you
at the end of, okay,

149
00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:28.690
now what you know, and
let's say, okay, let's say

150
00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:31.420
you have a, you know,
someone who really enjoyed what

151
00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:34.810
they did, you know, with
those materials, like learning, scratch,

152
00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:37.330
or, you know, other hour
of code materials that are

153
00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:39.250
out there. And then now
they want to really get

154
00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:42.550
into actually making something, you
know, in the real world,

155
00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:46.810
where does non-trivial begin. Yeah.
And what I found is

156
00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:49.600
a lot of times, there's
just this cliff drop off

157
00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:52.750
of, you know, okay, now
here in the deep end

158
00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:57.030
go, you know, so what
I was trying to do

159
00:08:57.030 --> 00:09:01.020
with my tutorial was just
trying to give them a

160
00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:05.760
little bit of a more
realistic intro to what the

161
00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.100
coding is actually going to
be like for making a

162
00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:11.940
game. And I found that
when I was learning coding

163
00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:15.000
years and years ago, I
learned by, you know, typing

164
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.990
code. And that was in
these magazines. You know, that,

165
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:22.350
you know, you'd have the
three, two, one contact magazines

166
00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:24.480
would have these programs in
the back that you could

167
00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.760
type in. And then you,
you know, you type it

168
00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.500
all in and then you'd
run it and maybe something

169
00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:29.760
would be wrong. You go
back and fix it and

170
00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.500
then you've run it. And
it does this cool thing.

171
00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.690
And now you have this
program typed in, you can

172
00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:35.680
go and tweak it and
change it. And I found

173
00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:38.610
that was actually more effective
for learning how to program

174
00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:43.830
than really like learning like
step by step individual things

175
00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:47.490
about programming. It was, you
know, actually just typing in

176
00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:50.460
a bunch of code and
then making tweaks and changes

177
00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:53.100
and then continuing to make
tweaks and changes until you

178
00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:55.230
really start to get your
head around, Oh, this is

179
00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:58.880
how this works Indeed. In
your tutorial. One of the

180
00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:01.310
things that I appreciate that
you've done is that from

181
00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:04.550
around nine page 28 or
page 30, there's like a

182
00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:06.950
wall of code. And you
say, just type this in,

183
00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:08.930
you know, like just type
it in, trust me, it'll

184
00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:11.990
be fine. But honestly, other
than having a funky font,

185
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:13.490
because if you take a
look at Pico aid, it

186
00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:16.220
has a very unusual kind
of all caps font that

187
00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:19.040
can make your eyes blur
a little bit. I think

188
00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:23.960
it's only like 25 lines.
It's not pages and pages.

189
00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:26.780
And I remember in the
back of compute magazine, you

190
00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:29.310
know, writing three or four
pages and there's not even

191
00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:31.850
so much as an explanation,
No, it's just straight up.

192
00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:35.030
Yeah. So that was intentional.
I didn't want each step

193
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:37.130
to contain more than, you
know, a certain amount of

194
00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:39.680
code to type in because
I've, I've taught a lot

195
00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:42.560
of students and writing a
lot of code can, you

196
00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:46.520
know, derail a lot of
times, but there is something

197
00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:51.950
educational about just typing in
code and not just copying

198
00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:54.620
and pasting it from one
thing from know you tutorial,

199
00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:58.040
text and pasting it into
the editor. There's something actually

200
00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:01.790
educational about typing it in
yourself and doing that a

201
00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:04.670
lot. But I did want
to keep it limited. So

202
00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:07.250
you're not just typing in
pages and pages. It's a

203
00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:08.780
really good point. I do
think that a lot of

204
00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:11.300
tutorials do propose that we
copy paste from here to

205
00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:13.910
there. But you're basically saying
the same thing that people

206
00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:16.580
say when you take notes
during a lecture, even if

207
00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:18.910
you never read the notes
again, the act of, of,

208
00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:21.710
you know, the kinesthetic act
of having it go into

209
00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:23.930
your brain, out into your
hands, onto a piece of

210
00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:26.120
paper, and then back into
your eyes, even if it

211
00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:29.090
never does that, again has
value. Yeah. It really does.

212
00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:31.370
You, you start to, as
you type it in, you

213
00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:34.160
start to feel the flow
of, you know, Oh, this

214
00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:37.910
is how, you know, functions
are constructed and you you've,

215
00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:39.950
you've typed it in enough
times. You start to, Oh

216
00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:41.630
yeah, they're always going to
start with this. Oh yeah.

217
00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:43.130
Or you always have to
make sure you put this

218
00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:45.290
at the end, you know,
things like that. And you

219
00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:48.110
start to develop that, you
know, almost like muscle memory

220
00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:51.170
about typing code, but also
you just start to feel

221
00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:57.360
how it all fits together.
Hi, friends as a programmer,

222
00:11:57.390 --> 00:12:00.750
you think an object's with
Mongo DB. So does your

223
00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:05.160
database, Mongo DB is the
most popular document based database

224
00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:09.150
built for modern application developers
on the cloud era, millions

225
00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:12.570
of developers use Mongo DB
to power. The world's most

226
00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:17.670
innovative products and services from
cryptocurrency to online gaming IOT

227
00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:22.020
and more, you can try
Mongo DB today with Atlas,

228
00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:26.400
the global cloud database service
that runs on AWS Azure

229
00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:30.540
and Google cloud configure, deploy
and connect to your database

230
00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:33.570
in just a few minutes,
check it out at Mongo

231
00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:42.660
db.com/atlas. That's M O N
G O D b.com/atlas. One

232
00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:44.160
of the other things that
was interesting to me about

233
00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:45.960
Pico eight and why it
was an interesting thing to

234
00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:50.190
be chosen is that it
feels ancient in that you're

235
00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:52.860
writing code in the eighties.
And it feels very, you

236
00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:55.650
know, very basic. It feels
very much kind of like

237
00:12:55.650 --> 00:13:00.060
the metal in that you're
writing what feels like low-level

238
00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:02.310
code, right? But you also
have the power of a

239
00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:05.970
modern machine, 30 frames a
second, or maybe 60, if

240
00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:09.930
you, if you insist on
it, which then isn't the

241
00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:12.360
metal and it isn't ancient,
it's incredibly modern. You can

242
00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:14.730
do a huge amount of
stuff in 60 frames a

243
00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:17.970
second. Okay. Yeah. That's actually
one of the things I

244
00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:21.120
really like about it, especially
for teaching is because you're

245
00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:24.360
kind of like, as you
said, you know, down to

246
00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:28.170
the metal of it, you,
you have this fast feedback

247
00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:31.140
loop where you type in
some code and you immediately

248
00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:34.140
see what that code does.
You know, you can type

249
00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:36.030
in a few lines of
code and then run it

250
00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:39.240
and right there, you see
it. And that was something

251
00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:41.280
that I've, I felt has
been lost a bit, you

252
00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:45.000
know, basic was fantastic for
that, where you could just

253
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.130
type in a few lines
of code and see what

254
00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:49.440
it does. And I don't
know if you remember a

255
00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:54.510
gorilla Dodd basic from years
ago, but I learned so

256
00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:58.140
much code from just typing
in little pieces and making

257
00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:00.720
little tweaks and changes to
that basic code and then

258
00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:03.090
running it, and then immediately
seeing like, Oh, wow, all

259
00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:05.250
right, this changes the size
of the explosions. And then

260
00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:08.130
going and finding other things
that this changes, how fast

261
00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:11.850
the banana moves, you know,
things like that At my

262
00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:15.900
company, we call that the
developers inner loop, right? We

263
00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:18.420
wrote four loops and stuff.
The inner loop is the,

264
00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:20.970
make a change, press a
button, see the change. And

265
00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:23.370
if you can make the
inner loop as little as

266
00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:26.370
possible, where, you know, 50
years ago the inner loop

267
00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:31.090
was make a change. Right.
Right. Yeah. Back at the

268
00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:33.510
inner loop in game development
should be as fast as

269
00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:36.690
possible. And even ideally if
one could be making the

270
00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:39.510
change and having it, having
the game never stop running.

271
00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:42.420
Right. It would be idealized.
Yeah. I do remember someone

272
00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:45.870
actually did create something like
that, but the, but the

273
00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:48.450
Interloop in Pico weight is
very short and I feel

274
00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:51.410
that's important for people who
are learning programming because you

275
00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:54.110
can, you can see what
each change does and you

276
00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:57.620
can, you can feel how
it, how it developed as

277
00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:00.790
you build it. Yeah. Especially
since there's a lot of,

278
00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:03.670
of kind of like low
key math involved in this

279
00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:05.740
case, it's kind of basic
algebra. So if I'm going

280
00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:08.350
through creating the moon land
or get the cave diver

281
00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:12.010
game in your Azine, I'm
changing X and Ys and

282
00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:14.770
sprites and thrusts and kind
of physics, physics, and whatnot.

283
00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:16.480
I want to be able
to save and run, save

284
00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:19.060
and run. And, you know,
I think I made a

285
00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:21.820
couple of typos and it
was pretty clear, you know,

286
00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:23.980
when the Lander goes flying
off into the corner, that,

287
00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:25.900
that, that was my bad,
not your bed. Yeah. Yeah.

288
00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:28.570
Now there's two things that
are not realistic about the

289
00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:32.110
tutorial that I wrote I'm
in or the tutorials that

290
00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:37.870
are in those scenes. One
they're, they don't go concept

291
00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:40.960
by concept explaining. And so
you like your, it doesn't

292
00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:43.360
give you an explanation in
an under a full understanding

293
00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:46.540
of each concept as it
goes, really the, the goal

294
00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:49.930
of those tutorials is to
harken back to those days

295
00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:51.280
where you just type in
a bunch of code and

296
00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:53.380
run it and see what
happens and then go tweak

297
00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:56.950
stuff. And those, you know,
as you mentioned, there'd be

298
00:15:56.950 --> 00:15:59.260
pages and pages of code
and you wouldn't know what

299
00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:00.910
it does. You just type
it in and see what

300
00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:04.630
happens. And there is some
value to that. So I

301
00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:08.530
wanted the tutorials in that
scene to reflect that where

302
00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:10.090
you just type in a
bunch of code and then

303
00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:12.700
run it and see what
happens. But there's also an,

304
00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:15.850
another aspect to it. That's
a bit artificial, which is

305
00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:20.530
each step of those tutorials
does not go and change

306
00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:25.510
previous code. You're just building
on what code you've already

307
00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:28.930
written. And the original versions
of the tutorials that I

308
00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:31.960
had tested out with a
number of students actually had

309
00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:34.180
to go back and change
code, because that's often what

310
00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:36.640
you actually do when you're
really writing code is you,

311
00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:38.950
you write something and you'll
go back and change it.

312
00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:43.660
Seven, eight, nine, 20, 30
times before you're done. And

313
00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:47.290
this one, because it's, as
a tutorial, I found that

314
00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:50.860
when students had to go
back and change something, that's

315
00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:53.590
almost one for one where
they went off the rails

316
00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:56.320
and got lost, or, you
know, didn't understand what was

317
00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:59.530
happening. And so I built
this one where you only

318
00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:02.140
are adding on to the
code that you've already written

319
00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:06.460
and those difficulties cleared right
up. But again, that's not

320
00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:09.760
a, that's not a, you
know, a realistic way that

321
00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:14.620
you write code. Sure. But
as an OnRamp though, always

322
00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:18.310
moving forward. Right. Makes sense.
Like, if there's a really

323
00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:21.190
great device that I recommend
to folks that are teaching

324
00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:24.790
kids to code called the
Piper, and it's a little

325
00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:27.400
raspberry PI based machine and
you build it out of

326
00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:30.430
wood, so they send you
the pie or the screen.

327
00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:32.770
And then when you assemble
a laptop, particularly, right. Yeah.

328
00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:38.350
And the game uses a
custom Minecraft engine. I remember

329
00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:42.790
that. Yeah. Yeah. It has
no keyboard. And you actually

330
00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:45.910
can do the whole first
tutorial using just the mouse

331
00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:49.180
because you're basically helping a
little robot learn to walk.

332
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:52.890
And during that, you actually
get, you get a breadboard

333
00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:55.260
and you wire up a
button and the first button

334
00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:58.770
is to move forward. Huh.
Literally it can't move left

335
00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:01.830
or right. It can only
move forward. Yeah. And then

336
00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:05.280
in the moving forward, you
can then get the ability

337
00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:07.770
to turn left, to turn.
Right. It's a similar kind

338
00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:10.440
of an idea where there's
no modifications. There is it's

339
00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:14.220
right. Only as you March
forward. And you've designed your

340
00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:17.310
Xen where you have basically
the text grayed out that

341
00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:19.350
you've already written. Right. And
all they have to do

342
00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:22.680
is insert. So it's insert
only, it's a very clever

343
00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:25.650
way to teach. And it
prevents a lot of potential

344
00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:28.200
mistakes and whether it's realistic
or not, doesn't matter, it

345
00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:31.520
sets the kids up for
success. Yeah. And you know,

346
00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:34.280
it, it's very helpful for
them to have that feeling

347
00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:37.370
of like, Oh, I'm like
continuing, you know, to add

348
00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:40.250
things and move forward. And
then it also just makes

349
00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:42.860
it easier to, they're already
learning so many other things

350
00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:46.040
at the same time, you
know, to then muddle up

351
00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:47.540
by having to go back
and change something that you

352
00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:50.780
already created can make it
something. And by kids, I

353
00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:54.050
mean, full grown adults, like
my, exactly. I enjoyed who

354
00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:57.110
enjoyed doing this kind of
stuff. Yeah. The other thing

355
00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:59.540
that I think is interesting
about picking this way to

356
00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:03.110
teach people, things is with
Pico eight, of course, the

357
00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:06.680
sprites and the sound effects
are built in and at

358
00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:10.340
no time does the, does
the, the, the learner have

359
00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:13.910
to maintain a file, right?
I've been having this issue

360
00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:16.910
with teaching young people C
sharp, they'll save the file

361
00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:19.620
and lose it. Like I
saved it on my desktop,

362
00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:21.290
or I saved it in
my documents, or it ended

363
00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:25.130
up in pictures while dealing
with sprites and stuff is

364
00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:28.880
all kind of integrated. It's
a complete IDE for lack

365
00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:31.340
of a better word for
making games. Yeah. I like

366
00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:33.950
that's another reason I really
enjoyed is because it is

367
00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:37.520
all self contained. So you're
just working in one environment.

368
00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:41.120
Everything's all in one, When
you plan your games and

369
00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:43.280
you've made a number of
games and you've done kind

370
00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:45.920
of a top down, you
have a larger, top-down how

371
00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:48.740
to make a top down
game. Do you plan out

372
00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:50.870
the sprites ahead of time?
Do you plan, how do

373
00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:52.430
you, where do you start?
If I was going to

374
00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:55.370
sit down and I've finished
your tutorials, and now I

375
00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:57.950
want to make a game,
what do I start at

376
00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:02.390
Last way that I suggest
is to figure out what

377
00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:04.250
are the systems you want
in your game and by

378
00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:08.120
systems? I mean, what are
the, the very tight pieces

379
00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:10.550
of functionality? Like for instance,
do you want the player

380
00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:14.090
to move up down left?
Right? Do you want the,

381
00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:17.420
do you want enemies to
move around on their own?

382
00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:20.180
Do you want them to
just move on a track,

383
00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:23.660
basically? You know, do you
want to have a scoring

384
00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:26.630
system, things like that? You
like just decide those simple

385
00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:29.780
systems that go into your
game and it can take

386
00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:32.750
some time to figure out
what those are, but once

387
00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:36.680
you have those, then you
can start to code those

388
00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:40.220
individual systems. Like, for example,
okay, you want your player

389
00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:43.700
to move? All right. Well,
let's you okay. Code how

390
00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:46.040
you want them to move,
you know? And then right

391
00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:48.610
now I want the enemy
to move. Okay, good. Let's,

392
00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:51.280
you know, code that in.
And I found that breaking

393
00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:54.160
it down into the systems
first really helps you because

394
00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:57.730
then you, you know what
your game is actually composed

395
00:20:57.730 --> 00:21:00.790
of also figuring out what's
called the game loop, which

396
00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:03.550
is what's the flow of
the game. You know, there's

397
00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:05.920
a lot of games that
feel really complex, but when

398
00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:09.280
you break them down, they're
actually fairly simple. You know,

399
00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:12.130
you're like, for instance, there's
lots of arcade games where,

400
00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:16.420
you know, the, the game
loop is, you know, destroy

401
00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:20.740
enemies, collect pickups, get stronger,
defeat a boss. And then

402
00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:23.770
that loops around destroy enemy.
You know, it's like, yeah.

403
00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:26.530
And it just, it's a,
it's a tight loop that

404
00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:28.930
just consistently it can get
harder and harder and have

405
00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:31.420
more types of enemies and
more types of pickups and

406
00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:34.240
more types of upgrades and
bigger and better bosses. But

407
00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:37.210
that game loop, you know,
is pretty much the same

408
00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:39.610
thing the whole time. And
if you can figure out

409
00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:42.070
what that game loop is,
that goes a long way

410
00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:43.900
to being able to figure
out, okay, how do I

411
00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:47.500
want to plan my game
and also understand how much

412
00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:49.780
of my game have I
done? You know, that's a

413
00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:52.950
really good Way to teach
kids systems thinking. I did

414
00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:55.860
a great podcast on not
teaching kids, how to code,

415
00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:59.580
but teaching people how to
think. Yes. And, and, you

416
00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:01.680
know, like I said, I'm
grown, but you're making me

417
00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:03.810
go back and think about,
like, for example, a game

418
00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:07.770
that I made, I played
rather yesterday called control. That

419
00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:11.220
just came out where you
play a Scarlet, Johanson looking

420
00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:14.460
red head, who is a
secret agent who is also

421
00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:17.940
telekinetic. And it's like, it's
the new hot AAA game

422
00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:21.840
of the summer. Right. But
ultimately picking up stuff and

423
00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:25.080
throwing it at stuff with
your mind, the things up

424
00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:28.680
and make explosions is awesome.
And it will sustain you

425
00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:31.050
for 15 to 20 hours.
You know, that's very true.

426
00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:33.990
It's like, it's a whole
thing. And there's, you know,

427
00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:37.260
famous actors and great voiceover
work and a huge plot,

428
00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:39.540
but ultimately it's picking stuff
up in your mind and

429
00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:41.990
blowing things up. Right. Yeah.
And you know, that's an

430
00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.240
effective game loop. Yeah. Or
Zelda. Yeah. You could go

431
00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:47.430
and break it all down
and Zelda and games, like

432
00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:50.670
it also have sub system
within it that are also

433
00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:53.910
fun. Like, like cooking. Yeah,
totally. Yeah. And he, and

434
00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:56.280
each of those have their
own game loop and it

435
00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:59.880
actually that translates really well
into how you're, how you

436
00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:02.610
create the games in terms
of the code to, you

437
00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:04.410
know, it makes it easy
to know like, Hey, what,

438
00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:07.170
what does this code do?
Oh, this is to handle

439
00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:10.560
this part of the game
loop. Interesting. And then once

440
00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:13.410
you figured that out, it's
ultimately, I assume it's just

441
00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:15.600
like the 80 20 rule.
Right. It's easy to get

442
00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:18.210
80% of it working in
20% of the time. And

443
00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:19.590
then you just tweak the
heck out of it until

444
00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:22.440
it's truly enjoyable down to
the pixel. Yeah. It really

445
00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:26.250
is true. Interesting. One of
the things that I found

446
00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:29.700
a little bit confusing is
this concept of tables in

447
00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:32.310
Pico eight, because it seems
to be the one and

448
00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:36.120
only in primary data structure.
I'm curious when you're teaching

449
00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:39.660
that to people, how do
you explain it? Tables are

450
00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:42.210
kind of unique. That was
actually something I was struggling

451
00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:44.790
with when trying to determine
would Pico eight, be a

452
00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:47.600
good tool for teaching students
to learn how to code

453
00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:50.600
is, how do I, how
do I deal with tables?

454
00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:53.480
Because tables can act like
a raise where you have

455
00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:55.730
like a numbered list of
things or they can act

456
00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:59.030
like, you know, or like
a table where you were

457
00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:02.990
each item has like its
own name. And really, I,

458
00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:06.050
I realized it's, it comes
down to the concept of

459
00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:09.950
it's a collection of things
and that's the simplicity of

460
00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:12.230
it. It's a collection of
things. And that collection can

461
00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:15.470
sometimes be ordered by number
or each item in the

462
00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:19.240
collection has its own number,
you know, and, you know,

463
00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:21.290
as, as we all know
it as an index, you

464
00:24:21.290 --> 00:24:24.770
know, or it can be
a name, you know, you

465
00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:28.130
can have player dot X,
player dot Y player dot

466
00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:31.490
speed player.health, you know, but
it could have, you know,

467
00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:33.980
it could just be a
list of enemies. And it's,

468
00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:36.260
you know, the first enemy,
the second enemy, the third

469
00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:38.570
enemy fourth, or it doesn't,
they don't really need identity,

470
00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:43.490
you know? So that's how
I've effectively, you know, dealt

471
00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:48.790
with tables is their collections,
collections of variables, Rather than

472
00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:52.330
making folks go through data
structures, class and learning that

473
00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:55.420
it's an array and it's
a hash table. It's a

474
00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:57.820
list of generic objects. And
it's a, and it's a,

475
00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:00.160
Because those are, you know,
just different types of collections,

476
00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:03.520
maybe more, more structured, or
have more rules about how

477
00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:07.450
that collection works. But essentially
they're just collections. That's very

478
00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:10.750
interesting. And do you think
that people should go from

479
00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:13.600
making a game like this
into something larger? Like, could

480
00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:16.510
you learn this small and
then go and jump into

481
00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:19.240
unity? Would it sets you
up for success? I found

482
00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:23.080
that if you are learning
how to create these systems

483
00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:27.340
and learning how that game
loop works and you know,

484
00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:29.680
you're actually, you've got some
practice under your belt of

485
00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:33.910
making con you know, consistently
making smaller games with these

486
00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:36.130
different game loops. It helps
quite a bit when you

487
00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:38.890
jump into something like unity,
which has a lot more,

488
00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:41.770
you know, meat and weight
behind it. And there's lots

489
00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:43.720
more things you have to
learn and have to have

490
00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:47.830
set up, but it can
orient you and keep you

491
00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:52.360
grounded into Oh, okay. For
unity. I need to all

492
00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:54.460
these things so that I
can do this game loop,

493
00:25:54.790 --> 00:25:57.310
you know, and there is
still the concept of a

494
00:25:57.310 --> 00:25:59.410
game loop in Pico it
as well. You have, you

495
00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:02.650
know, a start function and
update function, you know, things

496
00:26:02.650 --> 00:26:05.020
like that, but all are
happening as part of the

497
00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:08.590
game loop that you're there
directly translatable from things you

498
00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:11.140
learned in Pico eight. So
this might be an ignorant

499
00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:14.170
question, but you know, you
refer to the game loop,

500
00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:18.940
you know, like init update,
draw, repeat. Yeah. Would a

501
00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:22.120
triple a game somewhere it's.
I mean, it does, I

502
00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:23.980
guess it has to have
a main, and it has

503
00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:26.710
to have a game loop
somewhere. Yeah. Well, unity, how

504
00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:31.390
it works. Unity games are
built on these fundamental things

505
00:26:31.390 --> 00:26:35.080
called game objects and game
objects have a lifecycle that

506
00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:37.750
very clearly, like when you
open a brand new game

507
00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:41.140
objects code, the first thing
they drop right in without

508
00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:43.770
you having to type anything
is a and an update,

509
00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:47.610
you know, and the draws
kind of implied in unity

510
00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:51.000
will handle the draw apart
for you. But the start

511
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.460
in update are right there.
Start happens once when the

512
00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:56.310
game objects begins and update
happens every time it draws

513
00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:59.460
to the screen, you know,
and that's just, you know,

514
00:26:59.610 --> 00:27:02.700
that's how it's doing it.
And almost every game I

515
00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:06.330
know has that concept built
into it, like a initialized

516
00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:09.780
initialization, a start, and then
some thing that kind of

517
00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:14.600
moves the game forward. So
in Portland where you and

518
00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:18.470
I are, yeah, there's the
Portland indie game squad or

519
00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:22.880
pig squad.com, right? You're a
nonprofit that supports game development.

520
00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:26.270
What does that mean? Indie
game, indie game or any

521
00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:28.760
game enthusiasm? What makes us
Indy that we don't have

522
00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:31.100
a giant corporation telling us
what to do? Yeah. Or,

523
00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:33.650
you know, you don't have
a huge, you know, corporate

524
00:27:33.650 --> 00:27:38.570
structure to support you or
to, you know, dictate, you

525
00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:42.710
know, what direction something's going.
It's, it's usually smaller groups

526
00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:45.140
of people. I mean, some
of it's just a single

527
00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:47.510
person. Some of it is,
you know, a small studio

528
00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:51.560
of people. And the main
thing is that they have

529
00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:54.470
their own direction, that they
can take things and without

530
00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:58.760
having to, you know, deal
with anything else that goes

531
00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:01.760
with having a larger structure
or a larger corporation with

532
00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:04.100
it. And when I go
up and I look at

533
00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:06.290
the picture of the, of
the, of using the indie

534
00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:08.570
game squad, as an example,
you know, I see folks

535
00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:11.330
of all kinds of people
from all kinds of backgrounds,

536
00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:13.850
are these all gamers that
are supporting themselves with indie

537
00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:16.100
games or do they all
have day jobs? And that

538
00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:18.650
this is how this is
their hobby and their joy

539
00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:21.170
on the side, It's all
over the spectrum. We have

540
00:28:21.170 --> 00:28:23.420
people who do this as
a hobby. We have people

541
00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:26.870
who do this, this they've
created studios and are doing

542
00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:29.000
it as a studio. We
do have some people that

543
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.190
are part of the AAA
community that just kind of

544
00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:34.250
want to be able to
do their own thing as

545
00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:39.560
well. But a lot of
times it's just, it's, it's,

546
00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:42.650
you know, it's a mix,
it's a good mix. And

547
00:28:42.650 --> 00:28:44.510
is this something that's unique
to Portland? Or might there

548
00:28:44.510 --> 00:28:47.000
be an indie game squad
or something like this in

549
00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.850
the town or city that
the folks who are listening

550
00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:54.560
live in There are other
groups that do similar things

551
00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:58.520
to pig squad. Although from
my experience, pig squad does

552
00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:02.300
seem to be unique in
the size at which we

553
00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:05.810
do it. And the effectiveness
of which we have created

554
00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:10.310
a really inclusive community for
people at all levels of

555
00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:13.340
the game development field. Whether
they're just, again, whether they're

556
00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:16.730
just doing it as a
hobby or, or whether they're

557
00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:19.220
actually doing it as a
full studio. I also noticed

558
00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:23.450
that we, we do have,
in terms of inclusivity, we

559
00:29:23.450 --> 00:29:26.660
have people who do all
aspects of game development. A

560
00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:28.940
lot of people think of
game developer development. They think

561
00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:32.510
of programmers, but really that's
just one aspect of, you

562
00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:36.410
know, dozens of different specializations
needed to make a game.

563
00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:39.440
It's a really good point.
Like if my son was

564
00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:42.790
talking about, he wants to
put an E a, he

565
00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:45.490
called it an E sports
league thinks that this is

566
00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:47.710
going to be something he
could do at his school.

567
00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:50.440
But instead I'm thinking about
a way that would bring

568
00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:53.950
everyone in his school together,
artists and musicians, you know,

569
00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:56.260
putting together his own indie
game squad at his middle

570
00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:58.750
school or his high school.
Yeah. Might be a way

571
00:29:58.750 --> 00:30:03.010
because you're right. I'm pretty
decent programmer, but the sprites

572
00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:06.010
that I've been making in
trash, let's just be real,

573
00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:08.950
you know, so I, I'm
not a Swiss army knife.

574
00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:12.160
I'm just really a lousy
pair of scissors. Yeah. For

575
00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:14.410
one thing, having a really
good code of conduct that

576
00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:17.140
really defines, you know, how
we expect people to interact

577
00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:21.490
with each other is really
important. But presenting ourselves as

578
00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:26.050
very welcoming to anyone who's
interested in games, whether it's

579
00:30:26.050 --> 00:30:28.630
playing games or just making
them. And we found that

580
00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:33.010
we ended up creating a
community of people that are

581
00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:34.960
really willing to go out
of their way to help

582
00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:38.380
other people and include other
people who might be kind

583
00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:41.920
of shy about, you know,
diving in or not really.

584
00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:45.400
There's a lot of imposter
syndrome that happens in the

585
00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:48.160
field of game development. And
that's a very real thing

586
00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:51.760
that people have to deal
with. And we try to

587
00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:54.520
make it as easy as
possible for people to break

588
00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:56.320
out of that and get
passed on. That's a great

589
00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:59.140
point. Someone might be a
business analyst or an admin

590
00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:00.910
in their day job, but
they've got a great idea

591
00:31:00.910 --> 00:31:03.250
for a game system. They
could team up with a

592
00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:05.980
programmer who doesn't have any
ideas and make it pretty

593
00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:08.200
amazing game as a team.
Yeah. I mean, I've seen

594
00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:11.590
people who their full time
job was writing code for

595
00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:16.240
an insurance companies, and now
they work with a independent

596
00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:18.580
game studio and that's their
full time job is making

597
00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:22.330
games. Wow. That's fantastic. So
the easy on ramp could

598
00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:26.530
be PicoWay it could be
unity, but this absolutely happens.

599
00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:30.250
I, I, when I spoke
with Joseph White, the game Celeste,

600
00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:34.450
which is an indie game,
darling yeah. Literally started out

601
00:31:34.450 --> 00:31:37.180
as a prototype on PicoWay.
Yeah. Push the limits. And,

602
00:31:37.570 --> 00:31:38.940
and now as a real
thing, I can buy on

603
00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:41.380
my Nintendo switch or my
Xbox. Yeah. And you can

604
00:31:41.530 --> 00:31:43.960
play the original <inaudible> as
an Easter egg in the

605
00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:46.480
full game. It's really great.
It's embedded in the actual

606
00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:48.310
game. There's a little room
you can find, and there's

607
00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:50.020
a little computer and if
you boot it up, you

608
00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:53.470
can play the original Pico
weight version of Celeste inside

609
00:31:53.530 --> 00:31:57.160
the now full, you know,
full title of Celeste say,

610
00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:59.140
that's so cool. I love
that. It's a wonderful that

611
00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:02.620
they did that. Yeah. Fantastic.
So people can find you

612
00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:05.680
by searching for M boffin
B O F F I

613
00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:09.070
N a and check out
the Pico magazine, the pig

614
00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:11.230
squad, a lot of the
great stuff that you've done

615
00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:14.620
up on itch.io. I'm gonna
make sure to include links

616
00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:17.260
to all of this stuff
in the show notes. What

617
00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:20.110
a great way to have
a nice gentle on-ramp into

618
00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:22.780
game development. Thanks so much
for chatting with me today.

619
00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:25.360
Yeah. I'm happy to be
here. This has been another

620
00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:48.450
episode of Hanselminutes and we'll
see you again. <inaudible>.
