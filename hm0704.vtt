You can a guest instructor

12
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.600
at MIT and has done.
Master trainer program. How are

13
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.700
you? Good. Thanks for having
me Scott. Yeah, I always

14
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.200
love talking to people who
are excited as I am

15
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.700
to teach kids how to
code and when I was

16
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.400
reading first time coders that
folks can go ahead and

17
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.900
check out in the show
notes and you can buy

18
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.900
it at bookstores and online
everywhere. You call out a

19
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.000
number of things like there's
the fact that everyone wants

20
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.600
their kids to code. But
you also talked about we

21
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.100
have digital devices in every
Every kid's hands we worry

22
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.200
about screen time and you're
thinking maybe maybe we can

23
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.000
turn that around and screen
time isn't such a bad

24
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.200
thing. Definitely. Yeah, when we
look at the kids these

25
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.800
days that their childhood is
really surrounded by digital devices

26
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.500
be it the iPad or
tablet or smart phones and

27
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.400
a lot of times they
interact with it when they

28
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.300
see their parents using it
or their sibling using it

29
00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.700
and they turn them into
game. Devices is very easy

30
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.100
for them to download or
play with games that are

31
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.500
already loaded on the phone
or use it to watch

32
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.300
videos on YouTube or other
video platforms and it became

33
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.200
an entertainment place for them
to go to whereas for

34
00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.900
children. They are full of
creativity and they always want

35
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.600
to Tinker with things and
draw things or built things

36
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.700
using very hands on. On
experience and the good news.

37
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.000
Is that the past few
years. There are so many

38
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.200
tools out there that is
turning coding into such a

39
00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.000
accessible thing for even a
child as young as four

40
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.100
years old can start to
learn how to code and

41
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:55.400
so by introducing them simple
coding Concepts. We are essentially

42
00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:01.100
giving them back that creative
power onto. When they interact

43
00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.000
with the digital devices interesting,
so you call out a

44
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.300
couple of interesting examples in
the book. You mentioned like

45
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.300
Bill Gates, you know, many
years ago and his kids

46
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.700
were younger had very strict
limits Steve Jobs kids didn't

47
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.500
let them have an iPad
when it came out but

48
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.900
you're saying that rather than
turning them into kind of

49
00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.500
mindless consumers. We turn them
into creators by being more

50
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.500
flexible about screen time, but
we make them we allow

51
00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.100
them rather to create and
code using those devices. Yeah,

52
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.600
definitely. And the main thing
that I think is important

53
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.400
when handling screen time with
young children is really to

54
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.500
differentiate their time spent in
front of the screen into

55
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.900
creative and passive uses. So
passive uses. It's like, okay

56
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.300
like looking at the screen
and playing playing yet another

57
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:57.500
round of games for the
10th or 20th time or

58
00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.500
watching videos that are just
Funny or kind of like

59
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.600
entertainment uses. Whereas creative use
could be you know coding

60
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.100
is one of them and
the other one could be,

61
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:14.500
you know, simply editing videos
or editing photos something or

62
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:21.700
even creating illustration on the
iPad. So all these things

63
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:26.400
are like the creative use
is very beneficial for a

64
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.700
young young child's development. Whereas
the passive Use is purely

65
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:37.500
entertainment you so by teaching
them this differentiation. I believe

66
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.600
is more empowering than you
know, strictly saying. Oh well,

67
00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.300
you know no screen time
and then, you know, once

68
00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.000
they grew up to a
certain age and the floodgates

69
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.700
open and they certainly can
use the computer then they

70
00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.400
they wouldn't know what to
do with it and they

71
00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.400
would need to learn that
eventually as well now, I

72
00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.400
think that's an interesting point.
Well, I don't think we

73
00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.200
We don't technically or often
think of like making music

74
00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.300
with GarageBand or playing with
iMovie as being coating. It

75
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.300
is structured system, you know
systemic thinking, you know it

76
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.300
again it is initially coding
but if you start making

77
00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.800
really complicated videos or content,
you're doing quite a bit

78
00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.900
of work to do that
and that is using the

79
00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.200
brain probably the same part
of the brain as one

80
00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:27.700
would use if you were
actually writing code. Yeah, so

81
00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.800
that active engagement we know
that is is is a

82
00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.600
reasonable thing, but it's worth
pointing out and you call

83
00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:34.900
this out in the book
that you know, a lot

84
00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.100
of parents they feel guilty
because they're using it as

85
00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.600
a babysitter. There's a lot
of anxiety about it and

86
00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.000
we're all making this up
as we go along right

87
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.900
like we're good to let
our kids watch Sesame Street,

88
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.900
but I don't know what
they're doing on the on

89
00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.000
the iPad and I don't
want to be lazy. I

90
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
don't want to catch myself
into letting the kids beyond

91
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.100
that for hours just because
I need a break and

92
00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.400
it's really I see that
as like every generation. There's

93
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.600
like a new tool that's
out there. Or I think

94
00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.500
when the television first came
out like those all these

95
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.200
paranoia about like, okay whether
this is something we should

96
00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.600
bring into the house and
so technology is really like

97
00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:13.500
a tool that we can
use it for our benefit

98
00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:17.900
or detriment and so it's
it's really about knowing what

99
00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.300
we want to get out
of it. And there's you

100
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.400
know, sometimes there's nothing wrong
with enjoying a video, you

101
00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:28.700
know to relax and I
think teaching our children to

102
00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:34.700
be Mindfully consuming or mindfully
spending time with technology is

103
00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:39.300
it's very crucial. You also
call out and I think

104
00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.400
it's really cool that you
bring this up is that

105
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:46.400
kids move through different developmental
stages. And if you try

106
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.600
to teach a four-year-old python
that four-year-olds probably going to

107
00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.300
just hate computers and think
oh computer suck on and

108
00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:53.500
then there you're going to
turn them off on the

109
00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.900
entire topic, right? So you
do point that out. Yeah.

110
00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:01.400
Yeah and and coding is
a challenging. Subject for a

111
00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:06.600
lot of parents to approach
for their their children because

112
00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:10.000
you know, not a lot
of parents know how to

113
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.100
code and if you didn't
learn it, even if some

114
00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:16.400
of some of us learned
it in University like the

115
00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.900
language is so different, you
know in there in this

116
00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:24.700
generation and probably evolved a
lot as well. So so

117
00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:27.400
it is it is different
from subjects like math or

118
00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:31.100
English or you know some
Objects that we learned and

119
00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:34.800
probably like the math and
English haven't been updated like

120
00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.900
the rules in the languages
and map hasn't been updated

121
00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:44.300
for four decades. So so
for coding sometimes we see

122
00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:48.000
parents come to us and
say well, you know python

123
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.100
is used by all these
big companies like Facebook and

124
00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:54.700
Google and so I want
my child to start learning

125
00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:58.900
python as soon as possible
and I think the essential

126
00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:04.000
things Remember here is that
coding is like there's so

127
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.300
many different languages and the
languages are always evolving and

128
00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:15.100
always there's always new languages
being developed and released and

129
00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:18.700
so for four year old
that started learning coding today

130
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.700
when they graduated from University
and going into the workforce.

131
00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:29.600
They're probably using very different
languages already for a computer.

132
00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:35.000
Programming languages. So the lesson
of the story here is

133
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:41.000
that instead of fixating into
one particular language choosing an

134
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.100
age appropriate language is really
important because it teaches the

135
00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:51.600
foundation the fundamentals of what
programming means and the concepts

136
00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:55.300
that are the computer science
Concepts that are pretty much

137
00:08:55.300 --> 00:09:00.600
very Universal across different languages.
So What we see is

138
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.600
that for children that have
a good foundation of their

139
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.800
first language. They go on
and pick up the second

140
00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:10.200
and the third language much
faster and also they can

141
00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:15.500
grab the new languages much
more solidly interesting that that

142
00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.300
I feel like and I've
talked about this before and

143
00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:19.700
I'm curious what you think
that there is a direct

144
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:23.300
parallel between learning a computer
language and learning a language

145
00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:25.800
to speak and you just
gave the example where a

146
00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:29.300
parent maybe even a non-technical
parent might say well pythons

147
00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:32.600
popular. We should learn python
just like I'm sure thousands

148
00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:35.200
of American parents are saying
well Chinese is useful or

149
00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.200
Spanish is useful. Our kids
should learn that therefore they

150
00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:42.200
will be more marketable. I
guess that we ought to

151
00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:45.200
get a job, but the
same thing applies in programming

152
00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.200
that there's always going to
be new languages and you

153
00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.300
know, it was Japanese in
the 80s and it's Chinese

154
00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:52.300
today at Spanish tomorrow. Maybe
we need to teach them

155
00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:56.300
how to learn languages how
to decompose problems. You know,

156
00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:59.100
I can't let you talk
about computational thinking that's more

157
00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:03.500
important than And just memorizing
syntax. Definitely. Yeah, I think

158
00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:07.800
coding is the greatest one
of the greatest way to

159
00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:13.200
counter the rote learning and
the you know, simply remember

160
00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:19.800
Rising type of learning process
that is quite common in

161
00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:25.500
in the previous generation of
learning and you know, I

162
00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:30.200
think schools and educators are
you know now ting to

163
00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:34.400
think about ways to teach
children in more problem solving

164
00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:40.700
ways and to break down
problems and apply their creative

165
00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:45.400
thinking to generate Solutions and
coding Falls right into this

166
00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:50.500
category where you know, if
anyone who has learned certain

167
00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:54.200
code certain amount of coding
before knows that there's very

168
00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:59.600
little amount of memorization that
is needed because the syntax

169
00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:05.300
Or the even the library
documentation is all online and

170
00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:10.000
you know, sometimes we we
tell them the students that

171
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.300
you know, a big part
of knowing how to code

172
00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:16.800
is also knowing what to
search on Google. So so

173
00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:21.200
knowing where to find the
knowledge and knowing how to

174
00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:25.600
bridge your the Gap in
the coding knowledge is really

175
00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:30.200
key and on and and
together with that. That is

176
00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:33.600
that you know, when it
comes to coding what we're

177
00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:38.300
really hoping for students to
learn is really how to

178
00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:43.500
think like a computer scientist.
So computational thinking which is

179
00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:47.700
really like a fancy word
for problem solving and so

180
00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:52.300
there's four key elements in
computational thinking first is the

181
00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:57.200
decomposition so breaking down the
problem and the second one

182
00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:02.400
is pattern recognition. So look,
At how similar or whether

183
00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:07.600
there's any patterns in the
problem and then abstracting. So

184
00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:10.900
abstraction is the third step
which is to start thinking

185
00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:15.100
about OK. How do I
formulate a solution that could

186
00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:21.000
be applied to more different
similar problems in the future

187
00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:26.100
and then generate an algorithm
to to to solve the

188
00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:31.600
problem. So so this is
this this computational thinking process

189
00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:39.300
is applicable regardless of any
what language what computation programming

190
00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:45.600
language someone is using and
and actually more more broadly.

191
00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:49.500
It can be applied to
even non-programmers right like so

192
00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:55.300
if someone is designing in
an organization in in a

193
00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:59.200
fast growing company, they might
need to look at you

194
00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:04.600
know. Using computational thinking to
break down that decomposing the

195
00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:08.100
problem that in front of
them and then psycho through

196
00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:11.800
the four steps and eventually
come up with solution. So

197
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.100
we see that coding, you
know, certainly there's a lot

198
00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:19.800
of interest in the technology
space now and a lot

199
00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:23.400
of parents now want their
like Aspire for their children

200
00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:27.900
to become the next maybe
Mark Zuckerberg or or Steve

201
00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:32.400
Jobs and to be the
tech entrepreneur becoming a very

202
00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:38.200
common aspiration for young children
nowadays, but at the same

203
00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:41.200
time I think coding is
really much more than that.

204
00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:45.200
It's like a way to
teach students how to think

205
00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:49.300
and how to solve problems.
So even if their career

206
00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:52.600
in the future doesn't lead
to you know, they probably

207
00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:57.800
maybe they never code anymore
the thinking process they learn

208
00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.500
from being a coder. From
building things using software and

209
00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:08.800
writing programs. It's still a
healthful thinking process that they

210
00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:12.700
learn and they can apply
to various jobs. Yeah, one

211
00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:14.200
of the examples that I
try to explain to my

212
00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:17.000
kids is that when you
know, they can get around

213
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.100
with Uber or Lyft today,
but I still want them

214
00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:22.000
to know how to change
the oil and change a

215
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.300
tire but the fact is
I haven't personally changed a

216
00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:30.300
tire and 15 years, but
the the skill was was

217
00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:33.600
fundamental to understanding how cars
move and everyone should change

218
00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:35.600
a tire once even if
you ride the bus the

219
00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:39.300
rest of your life totally.
Yeah, that's a great example.

220
00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:43.200
And I think that also
is about, you know, having

221
00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:48.400
that Curiosity and have like
understanding how things work around

222
00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:54.200
around us and technology is
such an intertwined aspect of

223
00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:57.900
Our Lives now right is
where we cannot shut it

224
00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:02.800
down and and I think
eventually you know, there's like

225
00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:05.800
I think there's no certain.
There's no best time to

226
00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:09.000
say. Okay. This is the
time age where it's good

227
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.600
to start looking at screens
or start introducing coding at

228
00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:16.600
the same time. Like, you
know, I think coding once

229
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.700
is a helpful tool to
help children in this generation

230
00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:26.000
to see the world in
a more informed way to

231
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.300
understand. Oh, you know, like
I've built you know, A

232
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.400
Maps like, you know a
travel app for my for

233
00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:39.200
my friends in this coding
class and and then when

234
00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:42.600
they download an app that
is related to that and

235
00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:46.600
they kind of see in
a more creators mindset and

236
00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:50.600
rather than just a user
at the at the other

237
00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:55.000
end. So I think that
part is also very powerful.

238
00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:59.600
Yeah. Hey friends. Let's thank
our new sponsor. Have you?

239
00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:03.400
The Uno platform yet Uno
platform is the open source

240
00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:08.500
platform for building native Mobile
Windows and webassembly apps it's

241
00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:12.300
tested on over 200 real-life
projects. You can build performance

242
00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:16.500
single code base cross-platform line
of business apps today. Now,

243
00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:18.700
I realize it sounds unbelievable.
So I'll say it again

244
00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:23.400
single codebase native mobile desktop
or web apps and you're

245
00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:27.500
using only xaml and c-sharp.
Nothing else is needed. There's

246
00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:32.100
Visual Studio support a Vibrant
Community using she sharpens Mo

247
00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:36.400
gives you skill and tooling
reuse check it out at

248
00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:41.500
platform dot U, n-- Oh
that's platform dot. You know,

249
00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:45.400
I also think that the
point you make about willingness

250
00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:51.200
to learn like jumping into
programming can be very intimidating

251
00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:55.400
and if we can get
kids early to believe that

252
00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:58.200
they can do something that
sense of power is important.

253
00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:02.200
Otherwise We will end up
self-selecting and ending up with

254
00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:05.500
just a certain kind of
personality in programming, you know,

255
00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:07.200
you don't want to teach
a four-year-old at math is

256
00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:09.000
hard and get that tape
in the back of their

257
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.600
head. Like oh math is
hard math isn't for me.

258
00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:14.200
We certainly don't want people
to be thinking computers aren't

259
00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:18.200
for me. Yeah, exactly. It's
such a big it's almost

260
00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:23.000
like that's like everything that's
around our lives. And you

261
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.700
know, our smartphone is just
a small computer on our

262
00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:30.100
hands. And so and I
think that really Brings back

263
00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:34.400
the the importance of choosing
something choosing tools that are

264
00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:39.200
age-appropriate and and stick with
it for perhaps a little

265
00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:44.000
bit longer than an like
a kid or even the

266
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.000
parent think is is feels
like it and so one

267
00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.900
example would be for Scratch,
which is a tool that

268
00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:56.700
we introduced for the six
to eight years old. We

269
00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:00.300
recommend that for students that
age group and You know,

270
00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:04.100
we have we have two
we usually see students that

271
00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:08.100
go through the entire Academic
Year, you know once a

272
00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:11.700
week type of thing and
to go through the same

273
00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:15.900
tool like scratch all over
and and it's very easy

274
00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:19.800
to say. Oh, well, you
know, they've done once one

275
00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:23.900
semester or scratch like what
about you know pythonic so

276
00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:28.200
there's always python the thing
about jumping from one language

277
00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:32.300
to the other is that
We always say that is

278
00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:36.900
you rather go deep in
one language and really understand

279
00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:40.200
like it's so powerful like
each language. You can create

280
00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:44.500
so many different projects. There's
so much fun that you

281
00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:47.400
know, not just kids but
even adults can can have

282
00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:52.400
fun on these Platforms in
so many different ways. So

283
00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:57.300
so sometimes one of the
key things that we see

284
00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:03.800
that prevents a student from
learning fully the language is

285
00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:07.800
to move on too quickly
and to feel the urge

286
00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:13.100
to almost like collect collection
of language that they know

287
00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:16.300
and each of them maybe
know a little bit but

288
00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:20.500
not too much. So we
see much more positive results

289
00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:25.000
when a student learn something
learn one language really well

290
00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:30.000
and create, you know, maybe
30 different. X and and

291
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.700
then they are very capable
and very confident about picking

292
00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:39.900
up the second language. Now
one of the things that

293
00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:42.100
I really appreciated about your
book is that you call

294
00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:45.300
out that no one language
is superior to another, you

295
00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:46.800
know, a lot of books
like this could make a

296
00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:50.300
big declaration and they would
say You Must Learn Python.

297
00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:53.100
That's the language that your
kids need and and you

298
00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:56.200
call out pick a language.
Here's you know, here's five

299
00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:59.100
or six. Here's what they're
good for. But when you

300
00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:01.600
do pick one stick with
it, right don't bounce the

301
00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:03.900
kids around a different languages
just pick one get good

302
00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:06.700
at it and then learn
as many as you can

303
00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:10.600
as many as make you
happy. Yep. Definitely. Yeah, these

304
00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:12.600
things are really important and
I appreciate it all so

305
00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:15.600
that I may be you
plan this did you write

306
00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:18.300
your book in such a
way that you weren't writing

307
00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:22.200
it for parents that are
programmers. This seems like a

308
00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.400
book that I could recommend
to someone who is a

309
00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:27.000
parent but isn't a programmer.
This is for regular people.

310
00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:32.700
Yeah. Yeah. Definitely. I think
you know, the one of

311
00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:37.000
the things I've noticed when
it comes to learn teaching

312
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.600
kids to code is that
it's so challenging for parents

313
00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:45.600
who haven't had that exposure
before and didn't know how

314
00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:49.100
to code and it's almost
that they are also curious

315
00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:52.600
themselves and they believe that
it's an important thing with

316
00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:55.800
for their children to learn
at the same time. It's

317
00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:59.200
not like math or English
or any other subject or

318
00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:04.200
even like Like science that
they've kind of learned in

319
00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:08.700
school, even though maybe they
don't use in at work

320
00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:11.600
anymore. Like they kind of
remember certain things here and

321
00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:15.100
there with coding is really
like almost a black hole

322
00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:18.200
where they're like, well, I
have no idea what coding

323
00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:22.700
is. So so part of
the one of the goals

324
00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:28.800
for this book is to
really did mystify coding learning

325
00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:33.800
for young children. To the
parents that don't necessarily know

326
00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:38.000
what coding is and hopefully,
you know, the way that

327
00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:41.400
the book is written it
because it makes coding as

328
00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:46.500
a subject much more approachable
for parents and and you

329
00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:50.300
know some of the projects
on for the different age

330
00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:54.000
groups. We hope that the
parents even even for the

331
00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:56.900
those who don't know how
to code can can read

332
00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:59.700
through it and can follow
it and work on it

333
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.500
next to their kids. It's
maybe it's just for for

334
00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:09.100
our family evening or weekend
activity and we've done similar

335
00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:13.700
workshops for like in-person workshops
for parents and their child

336
00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:16.500
as well. And it's it's
very engaging. It's actually a

337
00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:23.100
very fun bonding experience because
I think sometimes computers or

338
00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:29.900
digital devices are more of
a separating energy in the

339
00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:34.700
household. Let's say after dinner.
You know, let's say Mom

340
00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:37.500
and Dad might be, you
know, both on their phones

341
00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:40.100
on the couch or something
and then the kid is

342
00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:43.400
playing on the iPad. And
so everyone is like in

343
00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:47.700
their own worlds. And and
so that's one case and

344
00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:51.100
the other case sometimes would
be when sometimes that happens

345
00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:54.500
for children that are slightly
older when they start to

346
00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:58.500
use the computer to do
homework or they have they

347
00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:01.400
have you know, the one
laptop policy. A kid at

348
00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:04.700
school and they kind of
start to have this tension

349
00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:08.600
in the home. That's that's
like for example dad might

350
00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:11.000
say oh, why are you
on the computer again? Like

351
00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.300
are you playing games that
is you know, you have

352
00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:19.600
screen time limits, right? And
so sometimes we see that

353
00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:24.100
technology in the household becomes
such a tension or or

354
00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:29.300
at least like making family
members not as communicative and

355
00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:33.600
so hopefully for this book,
It can serve as an

356
00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:40.000
activity idea for families to
to to use technology as

357
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.600
well together and and parents
can learn something new. And

358
00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:47.700
of course, I hopefully the
child also can can pick

359
00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:51.000
up something as well through
some of the exercises in

360
00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.100
the book. Right? But you're
explicitly calling out the idea

361
00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:56.400
that we can choose to
let this thing be a

362
00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:59.200
thing that we control and
that rips us apart and

363
00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:02.400
it keeps us separate or
we can be intentional about

364
00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:05.900
how we use technology try
to make our kids creators

365
00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:09.100
not consumers or at least
not passive consumers and in

366
00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:11.800
doing so bring the family
together rather than taking it

367
00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:14.800
apart. Yeah, and it's such
a fun thing to do

368
00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.400
that. You know, I think
for the students for students

369
00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:21.000
that have been learning for
a little longer and they

370
00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.600
start to learn, you know,
building apps or building websites

371
00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:28.500
and really starting to build
things with JavaScript or Python

372
00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:32.300
and they can start to
really build Oceans for the

373
00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:35.600
family right? So one of
the examples I quoted in

374
00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:39.600
the book is one of
our students there who has

375
00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:44.200
three she has four siblings.
So if a big family

376
00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:50.300
and one of her end-of-year
project was to build a

377
00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:54.200
family calendar app for her
mom or well for her

378
00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:58.400
family because her mom has
been using a giant sheet

379
00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:00.600
of paper that is stuck
on the wall of the

380
00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:05.000
kitchen. Kitchen to keep track
of every single person's schedule

381
00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:08.700
and every week she would
drop something like a new

382
00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:12.700
piece of paper and manually
write down on the wall.

383
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.800
And so her a bit
became something that really is

384
00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:21.700
very personal right like probably
she can put it on

385
00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:25.900
the App Store and for
other, you know, seven seven

386
00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:30.700
people family to download, but
it's really intended for there.

387
00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:34.600
Her her own family. And
and I think that is

388
00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:39.200
usually one of the best
starting point for students that

389
00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:43.700
are starting to be able
to create websites or apps

390
00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:47.800
which is to solve solve
a problem. That is so

391
00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:51.200
close to them. You know,
it is their personal problem

392
00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:56.000
something that can help their
family their friends themselves and

393
00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.300
making that really make technology
much more of a a

394
00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:07.100
daily thing that and it
is very empowering to for

395
00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:10.600
for students to see that
while I can create something

396
00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:15.400
that makes my life better.
My family's life better in

397
00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:18.700
the even like a very
small way and it's fun

398
00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:21.800
to do that. Exactly and
I appreciate that because I

399
00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:24.300
think what you're saying is
that we need to have

400
00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:27.300
the kids only be intentional
but be problem solvers right?

401
00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:29.000
You are more powerful when
you can look at your

402
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.600
world and say hook mom
has it. Problem or Mom

403
00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:33.500
can say I've got a
problem maybe the kids can

404
00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:35.700
can solve that. They can
write an app or something

405
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.600
and in part 2 of
your book you actually specifically

406
00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:41.900
call out different age groups
and I like the way

407
00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:44.600
you made a taxonomy around
this when they're four or

408
00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:47.700
five they play when they're
six to eight. They Tinker

409
00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:51.200
tweens nine ten, eleven love
their games, but then 12

410
00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.300
and up, you know, you
can really start thinking about

411
00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:58.900
apps you can start solving
real problems. Yeah, and that

412
00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:03.200
really brings back the The
idea of seeing the world

413
00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:06.600
in a different light where
I think you know, there's

414
00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:10.900
one way to experience the
world would be like, okay.

415
00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:14.200
Well all these infrastructures built
for us, like for example,

416
00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:17.100
you mentioned like uber and
Lyft like, okay. Well great

417
00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:21.300
like so convenient for for
us to get around the

418
00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:25.700
city and you know, that
is something that and knowing

419
00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:28.800
how to code and having
the experience of building things

420
00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:33.300
really bring into Different perspective
of while you know, somebody

421
00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:37.900
built this and you know,
that's that's amazing. And also,

422
00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:41.300
you know, what are the
complexity that goes behind that

423
00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:45.700
and having that Curiosity to
ask these questions, right? And

424
00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:48.700
when you say you see
an application and you say

425
00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:51.100
somebody built this I think
the next question that I

426
00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:54.500
want my kid to say
is why wasn't it me

427
00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:58.700
like why not me please?
Yeah, that's that sense of

428
00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:01.900
power that we want folks
to have. So first time

429
00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:04.600
coders folks can go and
find it. They can look

430
00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:06.600
in the show notes. I'll
make sure we have links

431
00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:08.800
to Goodreads and all over
the place. It's from line

432
00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:14.200
Crest publishing. But you also
have an organization that teaches

433
00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:18.800
kids in person. Is that
correct? Yes. Yeah. So first

434
00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:22.000
code academy and I started
the company six years ago

435
00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:26.800
and back in 2013. And
yeah, so that is really

436
00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:31.400
the inspiration behind the book
where you know through With

437
00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:35.400
probably tens of thousands of
Barons over the years. We

438
00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:39.800
just like I just see
so many of these questions

439
00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:43.600
come up from you know,
very keen parents that want

440
00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:49.400
to bring bring their kids
to learn this important topic

441
00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:54.500
of coding and technology and
and and hopefully this book

442
00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:58.300
can can address some of
these questions and make it

443
00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:02.100
fun for both the the
Aaron and the parents in

444
00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:05.600
the process of learning to
code. Hmm. And first code

445
00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:08.700
academy is right now in
Hong Kong Singapore Taiwan and

446
00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:10.700
Macau. Are you moving that
to the West as well?

447
00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:14.900
Yeah, so we're starting to
offer online classes as well.

448
00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:19.100
And so yeah stay tuned
for that. Very cool. Well,

449
00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:21.300
thanks so much Michelle son
for chatting with me today

450
00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:24.500
about your book first time
coders. Thank you so much

451
00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:28.300
Scott. This has been another
episode of handsome minutes, and

452
00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:30.000
we'll see you again next
week.
