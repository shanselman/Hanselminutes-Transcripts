00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:51.110
web matrix with Rob Connery.
This is Scott Hanselman. This

8
00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.980
is another episode of Hansel
minutes and it's Microsoft shill

9
00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.440
week here on, on the
Hansel minutes. How's it going?

10
00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.450
I've got Rob Connery with
me today. How are you,

11
00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.610
Rob? Good. How are you
doing? I'm good. So you're

12
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.440
a reform shell. You used
to work for the man

13
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.210
and now you don't work
for the man. I do.

14
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.400
And you just actually work
for me. I did. I

15
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.250
did for a, yeah, for
a short time, unfortunately, but

16
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.420
that was fine. Yeah. Short
fund time. So I was

17
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.580
joking there. I said it's
Microsoft show week, but you

18
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.060
know, significant thing happened today.
We're recording on the 13th.

19
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.390
And that significant thing was
that a bunch of stuff

20
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.640
was released today. asp.net, MVC
three and web matrix and

21
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.470
orchard, and just a bunch
of stuff going on today.

22
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.380
But I wanted to talk
to you about web matrix

23
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.890
because this is not a
product that I would really

24
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.830
think you would have been
interested in. Yeah. And well,

25
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.740
to be honest, it wasn't
a product I was interested

26
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.080
in the first time I
heard about it was actually

27
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.290
when I still worked at
Microsoft. And when it was

28
00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.020
back when it was called
plan nine, and I remember

29
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.900
just thinking, well, that's a
bold name for a project,

30
00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.140
you know, and you heard
about what it was supposed

31
00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.860
to be and do. And
I thought, well, this'll be

32
00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.640
interesting. And then, you know,
razor comes out and these

33
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.950
things start happening and you
hear about the angle that

34
00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.090
it's going for and you
think what is going on

35
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.990
over there. And yeah. And
so you kind of instantly

36
00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.900
dismiss it and I'm not
sure, I'm not sure why

37
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.760
I did that. And I
sort of actually feel bad

38
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.650
about it. What do you
think? Why do you feel

39
00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.820
bad? Well, you know, I
remember, I think it was

40
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.850
David Fowler wrote a post about
is I think it's the

41
00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.600
microsoft.data DLL. It's the, it's
the web matrix data access.

42
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.440
Yeah. Okay. Is that right?
No, I think it was

43
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.780
a way of doing data
access, but yeah, he did

44
00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.940
a post. Yeah. Well, okay.
So it was just a

45
00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.290
thing and it looked like
this was going to be

46
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.690
the way to do data
access in web matrix. And

47
00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.130
I was just stunned looking
at this, just thinking really,

48
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.060
you know, I mean, we've
passed so many milestones in

49
00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.910
the dotnet realm and one
of those being data access

50
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.450
and understanding about SQL injection,
no one likes to use

51
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.880
sequel on and on and
on. There's a lot of

52
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.110
really high ended abstraction tools
that Microsoft has. What are

53
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.260
we doing here with, you
know, inline sequel. And I,

54
00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.410
I remember I tweeted this,
I said, data access is

55
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.590
hard. Let's go shopping. And
I linked to David Fowler's

56
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.510
post. And of course, you
know, I got a lot

57
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.560
of snide and snarky and
funny responses, but now after

58
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.320
having used it, I'm completely
hat in hand, a handover

59
00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.770
heart, the other hand, over
heart thinking I was wrong.

60
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:34.980
Alright, let me, let me
ask you this. One of

61
00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.920
my favorite quotes and you
know, how quotes are on

62
00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.450
the internet. They go from
person to person and who

63
00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.630
knows who originally said it,
but I think Jeff Atwood

64
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.200
was quoting someone, some physicist
or something about strong opinions,

65
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.980
weakly held. I always think
of you like that. Like

66
00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.800
strong opinions, weakly held to
me is like, you know,

67
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.590
arguing with you in a
bar in Vegas about something.

68
00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.620
And you're just like, you're
an idiot. This is ridiculous.

69
00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.350
Like, how do you you're
so intellectually dishonest. I mean,

70
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.120
I can't believe that you
would even, and then you

71
00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.890
realize somewhere in the middle
that you're wrong and you

72
00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.280
go, Oh, Oh, okay, cool.
Two things I think about

73
00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.850
that. I remember Jeff Atwood
using that phrase, and I

74
00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.820
remember thinking it's typical Jeff
Atwood, and I know that's

75
00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.500
going to sell made of
me, but that phrase is

76
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.590
an oxymoron. It doesn't make
any sense. I mean, I

77
00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.740
know typical about Jeff. Well,
it's true. I mean, with

78
00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.320
all respect and love to
Jeff halo, I hate when

79
00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.150
people say that to me
with all due respect anyway.

80
00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.250
Yeah. With respect to here's
something mean I'm going to

81
00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.440
say, I think, you know,
a strong opinion is a

82
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.800
strong opinion because someone believes
that deeply by definition, that's

83
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.140
not a weakly held opinion.
So, but I know what

84
00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.510
Jeff meant. You, Jeff man,
you can talk me out

85
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.990
of my position and I'm
definitely that way, you know?

86
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.980
And I, and I don't
think anyone can learn if,

87
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.370
if they're, you know, really
stuck in their own belief

88
00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.520
systems. And, but you know,
I do have my opinions,

89
00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.240
but those opinions I like
to think are founded on

90
00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.020
research and understanding. So if
you and I got in

91
00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.510
a discussion in Las Vegas,
right. I would like to

92
00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.940
think I have facts at
hand. And I've always said,

93
00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.820
you're one person I don't
want to argue with ever.

94
00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.910
Cause you like rally out
facts as if I don't

95
00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:14.220
know you have them in
your pocket. Like there's Scott

96
00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.300
Hanselman's geek Almanac. Tell it
to my wife. Right. Most

97
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.550
of my facts are called
into question. Right. Well, anyway,

98
00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.770
to your point, yeah, I
do have strong opinions, but

99
00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.750
the thing that drives me
nuts a lot of times

100
00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.720
is when people just wave
their arms and cite someone

101
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.270
else, you know, said and
so on. But in this

102
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.690
case we sat down, you
and I, we cracked out

103
00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.300
a live site and it
was enjoyable. So let's talk

104
00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.790
about that. Let's talk about
that because I, you know,

105
00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:40.500
I mean, I worked for
the group that made web

106
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.530
matrix, but I, I, I
said to myself that, you

107
00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:46.230
know, do we, do we
need this toy IDE you

108
00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.870
know, I do everything I
need in visual studio. I

109
00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.640
don't want to, I mean,
you know, I have lightweight,

110
00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:54.060
lightweight for me is asp.net
MVC. I've got a lot

111
00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.030
of choices, a lot of
flexibility. Although I always feel

112
00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:58.960
guilty. Of course, when I
write an MVC application and

113
00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.880
I don't have like robust
unit tests and stuff, you

114
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.450
know, I just do, I
really want a little cheesy

115
00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.150
kind of a thing to
write my, my, my sights.

116
00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:11.060
And then you, you and
I have this other podcast,

117
00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:14.570
right? There's this developer's lifestyle
con and you had written

118
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:19.430
that in kind of custom
Rob Connery, Ruby Sinatra thing.

119
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.320
Right. That was that, that
was our initial thing. Cause

120
00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.350
what happened was we were
on Tumblr and Tumblr went

121
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:26.720
down to the point where
it was down more than

122
00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.510
it was up. And you
said, this sucks. So then

123
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:32.120
you switch it over to
your kind of, you know,

124
00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.610
it was half static files,
half Sinatra if I remember

125
00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:37.480
correctly, Just so in case
people are wondering, it's a

126
00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:41.170
CMS called Nesta Nesta, CMS.
Yup. Next to CMS, a

127
00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:44.260
Ruby rails space. Right. Or
is it only Sinatra, Sinatra,

128
00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:48.010
Sinatra, pastes, excuse me, CMS.
And I wanted to get

129
00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:50.170
involved in that too, but
you know, it was, there

130
00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:51.790
were, I was thinking, Oh,
I will, I'll install Ruby.

131
00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:55.200
And I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll
maintain the website, but it

132
00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:57.220
still seemed a little more
complicated maybe than it needed

133
00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:59.710
to be. And then you
just said, Hey, let's use

134
00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:04.450
web matrix. And I was
like, Oh, okay. Yeah. Well,

135
00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.450
you know, I know it
sounds strange, but I had

136
00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:09.490
toyed around with web matrix
a little bit. And I

137
00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:12.190
think it was when Eric
Hexter came to us with

138
00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:17.590
MVC comp at tech pub
and, and he had said,

139
00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:19.660
wow, this web matrix thing
is rad. He made the

140
00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:22.000
site in web matrix. So
I kicked it up and

141
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.850
tried it out. Sure enough.
I was really impressed. And

142
00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:27.010
so I was thinking at
the time it would probably

143
00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:29.770
take me more time to
get you set up on

144
00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:31.840
a VM and not to
get you set up, you

145
00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:34.060
know, a bunch of you
don't Linux, you know, but

146
00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:36.640
to, to walk you through
here's RVM and set up

147
00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:40.420
all these things, you know,
you know, Ruby, you know,

148
00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:43.660
these things, but it would
just take time. Yeah. 34

149
00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:46.270
to six hours of messing
around just to get everything

150
00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:48.580
right. So we could, we
could deploy in one click.

151
00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:52.360
And for me, the chance
to learn something is, is

152
00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:55.780
intoxicating. It's like you can't
dangle a fatter carrot in

153
00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:58.870
front of me. Yes. And
so I just was like,

154
00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:01.090
Hey man, beta three, we
got the release coming around

155
00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:04.240
the corner. We're kicking up
a, in the next month,

156
00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:05.770
we're going to do a,
what matrix series, a tech

157
00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:08.290
pub, Hey, let's just get
started and deploy a site.

158
00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:10.900
This would be fun. Okay.
So you went and did

159
00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:12.790
that and then you called
me, I think, you know,

160
00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:15.370
halfway through yesterday, it was
funny. Cause you got it

161
00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:17.470
up to a point where
you're like, I'm done, I've

162
00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:19.900
learned what I need to
learn. You go and you

163
00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:23.230
throw it in Dropbox. And
we have a shared Dropbox

164
00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:25.630
for the show and you
said, all right, I don't

165
00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:27.610
want to play anymore. You
figure the rest of it

166
00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:29.830
out. And here's all the
problems. And we basically did

167
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:31.330
a little bit of pair
programming as you got me

168
00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:34.870
up to speed paraprogramming over
Dropbox is hilarious. By the

169
00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:37.510
way, he has web matrix
open. I have it open.

170
00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:39.940
I hit save. He goes,
ah, darn it. And it

171
00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:44.260
says, reload file has changed.
Yup. No get no source

172
00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:48.760
control. Just, you know, we
were, we were just working

173
00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:51.730
on the same shared files,
basically ridiculous seat of the

174
00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:54.880
pants. So you do the
pants, total slop, and then

175
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:57.030
you said, all right, I'm
done. I gotta go. And

176
00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:59.400
then I spent the next
four hours kind of refactoring

177
00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:03.270
and tidying up and learning
and learning and learning. And

178
00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:05.880
you know, I think we,
we probably spent more time

179
00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:07.920
getting deployment to work than
we did actually writing the

180
00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:11.550
thing. Oh absolutely. We were
into it for about six,

181
00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:13.880
seven hours. And that was
about it. It's really easy.

182
00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:17.360
Well, that's the thing that's
really compelling to me about

183
00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:20.720
what matrix is as I
was learning it, it was

184
00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:24.200
an, I call this process
like a zero to 60,

185
00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:26.210
or I guess you can
think of it as like

186
00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:30.830
trying to get through the
learning curve, into solving a

187
00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:35.840
business problem directly, right. With,
with tools like rails a

188
00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:38.630
Sinatra. I mean, it kind
of just scoots you along

189
00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.900
and you go at a
pace and Sinatra is so

190
00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:44.330
bleedingly simple. You can Google,
if you get a problem,

191
00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:45.860
how do I do this?
And the solution is right

192
00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:47.660
there. Oh, okay. And then
you learn it as you

193
00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:51.740
go. And I always had
issues with when I was

194
00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:55.400
learning asp.net and MBC as
well, mostly because this stuff

195
00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:57.200
just isn't out there or
it's hard to find, or,

196
00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:00.710
you know, nowadays it's probably
simpler, but with web matrix,

197
00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:02.870
how do I like, how
do I do this with

198
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:05.090
a helper, boom there's blog
posts. And most of the

199
00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:08.450
time I was on your
blog and I was, Are

200
00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:11.120
you saying that this reminds
you of the same style

201
00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.650
of Sinatra as far as
the same style of how

202
00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:15.890
you learn It's that light?
It is that light. It

203
00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:17.810
gets the abstraction right out
of your way. Here's an

204
00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:21.350
example. I remember I was
fretting over how do I

205
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:24.830
deal with our URLs? Cause
Tumblr uses a strange URL

206
00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:26.330
scheme and they appended a
number and so on and

207
00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:28.430
so forth. And I thought,
well, I'll just mirror the

208
00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:31.100
directory structure. Like not sloppy.
There's gotta be a better.

209
00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:32.580
Let me just, let me
pause you for a second,

210
00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:34.850
just to make sure people
understand. We had an existing

211
00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:37.970
site at this developer's life.com
that was run on tumbler.

212
00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:41.270
And they had specific URLs
with like slash a funny

213
00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:43.940
number slash the title that
dah, dah, dah, we don't

214
00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:45.740
want to break our URLs
when we switch over to

215
00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:49.850
our new CMS. Right. And
I was just thinking, well,

216
00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:52.070
I could mirror the directory.
I could literally put in

217
00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:54.410
the directory, like one, two,
three, four, whatever it was.

218
00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:57.140
Right. And I'm like, that's
sloppy. And so I thought,

219
00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:58.790
well, okay, I know there's
a way around this. How

220
00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:01.460
do I do your writing?
And I found a couple

221
00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:04.310
of posts and I realized,
Oh, jeez, duh, it's your

222
00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:07.250
URL rewrite. That's a hard
word to say. And you

223
00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:09.770
just plug it into web
config. And within two minutes

224
00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:11.830
I was done and move
on. Right. It's built in,

225
00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:13.930
actually I'm looking at it
right now. It's a systems,

226
00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:15.980
our web server rewrite. And
then there's one rule you

227
00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:18.800
have, it's basically like three
lines. Yeah. And the thing

228
00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.320
that I like about it
is there's no massive abstraction

229
00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:24.440
that you need to understand,
which is like Sinatra with

230
00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:26.840
Sinatra, you say get, and
this is the URL you're

231
00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:28.670
going to respond to. And
here's the code that's going

232
00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:31.370
to respond to that URL.
And I loved it. I

233
00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:33.860
just sat there thinking, Whoa,
I don't need to understand

234
00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:36.590
some deep abstraction, some object
graph let's just get to

235
00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:39.830
work. And it was a
really good feeling. The us

236
00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:43.700
I've been playing around with
this, I'm trying to, I

237
00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:45.830
talked to Damien Edwards and
I was showing him some

238
00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:48.710
of the code. And he
said something really, really interesting.

239
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:51.200
I wanted to share with
you. He said, you're thinking

240
00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:54.130
too much like a programmer
because I was trying to

241
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:58.270
solve a problem. And I
was focusing on a bunch

242
00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:00.400
of different things, about a
perception of what I thought

243
00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:04.000
elegant looked like. And he
basically said, stop thinking like

244
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.860
a programmer. He said, the
only thing from a programmer

245
00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:08.290
perspective you should be thinking
about is if you're repeating

246
00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:12.620
yourself, other than that, any,
if anything goes and, and,

247
00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:15.490
and that was very interesting.
I mean, like I'm looking

248
00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:18.400
for example, at our default
dot CSS HTML file here,

249
00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:22.510
it's effectively a four loop.
We say like VAR shows

250
00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:26.080
equals shows dot reason for
each show and shows. And

251
00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:30.190
then it's mostly HTML. There's
actually more HTML in this

252
00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:35.520
app than there is a
code. Yeah. And Damien makes

253
00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:37.860
a very interesting comment. And
it's something that I've felt

254
00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:42.000
a lot working in the
Ruby realm is, you know

255
00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:46.590
what you're building is an
interaction with a user. And

256
00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:49.710
really what you're trying to
do is structure HTML. Then

257
00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:52.230
it's going to represent your
application. That's where your head

258
00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:54.930
should be now. Does that
mean in a sense, there's

259
00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:56.070
going to be a lot
of people listening to this

260
00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:58.590
show, reacting strongly. Oh great.
We're all going to be

261
00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:01.680
cavemen again. Not at all.
So what you just said

262
00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:05.160
was actually something interesting. We
centralize our logic. So our

263
00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.850
data call is centralized and
we don't repeat it. Why

264
00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:11.430
you just said was really
important. There is more HTML

265
00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:13.350
on this page and there
is code, which of course

266
00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:16.110
there should be, but it's
full of one liners. It's

267
00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:17.970
all it is, is one
liner calls to help us

268
00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:20.850
in everything. I love it.
It's a scripted approach. That's

269
00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:24.150
for sure. It's not a,
what I refer to as

270
00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:29.460
ivory tower. Component-based, let's overthink
this, you know, when really

271
00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:32.250
all we're trying to do
is structure HTML. It's scripted

272
00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:36.600
now you're using C sharp,
but it doesn't quite feel

273
00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:39.090
like C sharp. I mean,
like for example, in our,

274
00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:43.770
in our little show database,
we're returning a dynamic, we

275
00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:47.400
have like public static dynamic
find. And you basically like

276
00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:50.220
you go find a show
and return it dynamic. And

277
00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:55.980
there's no IntelliSense cause it's
totally dynamic. And that took

278
00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:57.930
a while to get you
to get used to, it's

279
00:13:57.930 --> 00:14:00.540
almost like the, the fact
that there's no IntelliSense for

280
00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:03.390
the code. There is for
the HTML and stuff, but

281
00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:05.670
not for the, not for
the, the, the co what

282
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:08.250
little code do you do.
Right. It didn't really matter

283
00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:11.610
because everything you're returning around
as a dynamic anyway, and

284
00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:15.540
the database, you basically say,
say database.open, and then the

285
00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:18.690
object pops out of it
with all the properties just

286
00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:21.240
sitting there. It's it's. Yeah,
that was one of the

287
00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:23.490
parts when I was putting
this together, that knocked me

288
00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:27.120
off my chair because they
started building out a, an

289
00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:30.330
object model, you know, you
know, articles and shows and

290
00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:34.290
whatever. And, you know, I
want a first time I

291
00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:37.530
ran a query. I remember
thinking, what is this doing?

292
00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:39.360
What's it returning? And in
my head, I was thinking

293
00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:42.780
that's going to return some
obtuse queryable of something, something,

294
00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:46.290
and know what I got
back was I innumerable dynamic.

295
00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:50.040
And I just thought, good
grief. That is a bold

296
00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:53.690
step right there. That unbelievable.
And for listeners out there

297
00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:58.490
that don't understand dynamic, it's
spinning up an object based

298
00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:01.430
on the names of the
fields in your database. So

299
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:04.280
we have a database called
a, what is it called?

300
00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:06.790
It's called shows. I think,
I can't remember, but yeah.

301
00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:10.340
Inside of shows. Yeah. And
inside of it, there's columns

302
00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:13.790
called title and slug and
description and so on. So

303
00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:15.590
to access that you access
it as if it's a

304
00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:18.680
property. And I just thought
that is incredible. I mean,

305
00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:21.220
there's no, you know, there's
no, I think there's that

306
00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:24.700
kind of active record, active
record line A little bit,

307
00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:26.830
you know, active record adds
an abstraction in for the

308
00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:29.110
query itself. So you're not
writing raw SQL and it

309
00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:30.910
structures the query for you,
which in some ways is

310
00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:34.030
good. And a lot of
ways it's bad. For instance,

311
00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:37.180
I was answering questions on
stack overflow today. Someone had

312
00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:39.130
a minute and minute join
and they're trying to do

313
00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:42.070
an all in one query
so they can get everything

314
00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:44.410
back. Oh boy, it's not
so easy, but you have

315
00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:47.260
to figure it out with
active record with SQL, you

316
00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.690
know? Yeah. That's easy. That's
a quick Google search. How

317
00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:51.400
do I join these? Do
we enter joins on all

318
00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:54.760
these records and off you
go, but People look at

319
00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:56.500
that inline SQL and they
say, Oh no, you know,

320
00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:58.900
now we're back to the
past. We've just made classic

321
00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:01.900
ASP and we're going to
have injection attacks and all

322
00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:03.490
that kind of stuff. Have
you found that to be

323
00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:07.180
the case? Well, I was
actually writing a post on

324
00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:09.700
web matrix right now. And
you know, one of the

325
00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:12.550
things that I observe in
the community is those people

326
00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:14.410
tend to be the same
people who don't want their

327
00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:18.340
HTML extracted, you know, or
abstracted. They just, they want

328
00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:19.840
to write their own. So
I said, just think of

329
00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:23.680
sequels, HTML for data, really.
You know what I mean?

330
00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:27.250
If you can master your
sequel, you can master so

331
00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:30.220
much with your site now,
does that mean everyone should

332
00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:32.770
be riding in line sequel?
Of course not. And I

333
00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:35.590
think if you're a more
seasoned developer, you're probably a

334
00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:38.170
lot more comfortable getting in
there with web matrix and

335
00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:40.600
doing it. And a lot
of ways I keep thinking

336
00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:43.420
this is a, maybe a
better tool for a more

337
00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:46.540
seasoned person. If, if a
junior person is coming in

338
00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:49.870
and learning by this tool,
they would probably need someone

339
00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:52.900
who's been working for years
in web development to sorta

340
00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:54.400
hold their hand through them.
Oh no, no, you don't

341
00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:57.280
want to do that. That's
a pitfall, you know, like,

342
00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:58.930
you know, you don't want
to append in that value

343
00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:01.480
that you've read off the
form coming in. That's bad,

344
00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:04.990
you know, that kind of
stuff. Hi, this is Scott

345
00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:07.390
coming to you from another
place in time. Are you

346
00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:10.780
using agile practices to manage
your software development? There's lots

347
00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:12.640
of tools in the market
that manage the steps of

348
00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:15.160
a project, but most of
them focus on individual roles.

349
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.100
Get ready for a solution
that caters for the success

350
00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:21.130
of the whole team. Guys
at Tellerik introduced team pulse.

351
00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:24.400
It's an agile project management
tool. That'll help you gather

352
00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:29.200
ideas, estimate plan, track progress
in a common workspace. Finally

353
00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:31.480
companies, regardless of their size
can use a lightweight and

354
00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:33.580
convenient tool. It makes all
the stakeholders work as a

355
00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:37.960
United team, even if they're
in different countries by combining

356
00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:40.900
intuitive user interface and the
power server light team poles

357
00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:43.840
removes the roadblocks that you
typically face and applying agile

358
00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:46.840
in an effective manner, no
more lost data, no disparate

359
00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:51.180
systems, no lack of critical
regarding the health and philosophy

360
00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:54.300
project. See if yourself, you
get a free copy for

361
00:17:54.300 --> 00:18:00.450
five users and one project
at tellerik.com/team poles. And please

362
00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:03.690
do thank tolerant for supporting
Hanselman it's on their Facebook

363

fan page, facebook.com/t L E
R I K coloring. We

364
00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:12.090
do appreciate it. There wouldn't
be a Hansel minutes. If

365
00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:15.170
there wasn't, Tellerik helping us,
you know, that they have

366
00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:17.820
that term, you hear around
Microsoft sometimes about falling into

367
00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:20.550
the pit of success, right?
The idea that you could

368
00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:22.590
goof up and still do
the right thing. Did you

369
00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:24.270
find that to be the
case and working with us?

370
00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:26.210
I did. It's funny. I
feel like you're reading my

371
00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:28.820
blog posts. I haven't published
it yet, but I'm one

372
00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:30.920
of the points that I
also made in there was

373
00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:34.910
I was putting together a
link. I forgot to what,

374
00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:37.190
but I needed to append
in an extension. It was

375
00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:39.950
a link off to our
MP3s. And so I was

376
00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:41.990
just trying to build it,
using some convention, putting the

377
00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:44.690
slug together and then appending
dot MP3 to the end.

378
00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:46.370
So I was just going
to like, hurry up and

379
00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:48.170
do that in the code.
Well, it didn't work the

380
00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:50.480
parcel. Didn't like seeing the
dot there next to the,

381
00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:53.750
to the value I couldn't
do. Concatenation it, it wouldn't

382
00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:56.450
work. And at first they
started cursing with, I thought,

383
00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:59.690
ah, ha let's just use
a helper. And that's precisely

384
00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:01.340
what I did. And then
I thought, well, I'll just

385
00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:04.910
use a helper for the
whole music link altogether, tightened

386
00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:07.700
up the code. Right. And,
and tightened up the UI

387
00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:09.200
to have a one liner
in it. And I thought

388
00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:13.010
that just pushed me to
do the right thing. Congratulations.

389
00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:15.440
That's just radical. I mean,
just think that's wonderful. I

390
00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:18.950
mean, I can't expound enough
on how refreshing that is

391
00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:22.610
to have an IDE and
a, you know, and language

392
00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:26.300
set like razor push you
to do dry or code.

393
00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:30.440
I think that's great. But
aren't you The, not the

394
00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:33.680
target audience for this? I
mean, we're, we're, we're here

395
00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:37.310
having a podcast about this
IDE that if you ask

396
00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:39.440
a Microsoft salesman, he's going
to say it's for the

397
00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:41.630
breadth developer it's for the
college student. It's for the

398
00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:45.890
person that wants to the
simplest thing possible. Well, this

399
00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:48.380
is why we're professional developers.
I mean, is it okay

400
00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:50.660
for us to want the
simplest thing possible? I think

401
00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:52.910
so. I mean, I could
be mean and say that,

402
00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:55.850
you know, perhaps the people
that are framing the marketing

403
00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:58.640
for this completely misunderstand the
development community, but I don't

404
00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:01.820
think that's actually true. I,
I see what they're trying

405
00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:05.210
to do. And I think
this will appeal to, let's

406
00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:08.690
just say a person coming
out of college. However, I

407
00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:12.740
think there is a growing
amount of people in the.net

408
00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:14.960
realm. That's another Java around
to the people that have

409
00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:19.610
learned web programming through these
high end structured languages that

410
00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:22.730
don't want to do it
anymore because it's complicated, right?

411
00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:26.060
And a tool like this
that does everything you need.

412
00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:30.770
That's not complicated. It actually
appeals to the seasoned developer.

413
00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:34.790
I would say more so
because it covers the scabs

414
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.910
for lack of better words.
Like for instance, a lot

415
00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:40.820
of people might say, well,
I've got this intense, like

416
00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:43.760
adventure work style database. I
need to mask it and

417
00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:46.610
abstract it through and hibernate
and map it. So I

418
00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:49.600
have usable on and on
right now, you really don't

419
00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:51.370
need to, you shouldn't put
a website on top of

420
00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:55.330
AdventureWorks. Anyway, what you could
do is use web matrix,

421
00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:58.180
make it simple, have some
sort of replication or other

422
00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:00.490
other kind of scheme in
the background. There's a lot

423
00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:01.960
of better ways to do
it. And I think once

424
00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:05.140
you get to a certain
level in your web development

425
00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:08.470
career, you start to see
that there's easier ways to

426
00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:11.710
do things rather than hitting
your domain model over the

427
00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:15.630
head with an irony. I
mean, do you, do you

428
00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:18.360
miss? I mean, do, do
you miss testing? Like don't

429
00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:19.740
you want don't you want
this to be, this is

430
00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:22.620
pretty fast and loose. I
mean, to be clear, yes.

431
00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:25.500
Our little site, I mean,
one could argue, right? Why

432
00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:27.750
didn't you just put it
up in Tumblr? Of course

433
00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:32.340
we did because, but, but
it wouldn't stay up that's

434
00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:34.170
Tumblr's fault. I mean, we
could have used postures or

435
00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:36.960
WordPress or whatever. Why did
we write a little CMS

436
00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:39.450
rather than using one of
the many cloud based services?

437
00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:44.760
Well, you know, we, we
talked about going that route

438
00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:47.580
a number of times and
you know, we're thinking maybe

439
00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:50.370
WordPress, maybe whatever, but I
think what you and I

440
00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:53.070
both found is we wanted
to diddle around with the

441
00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:56.670
HTML pretty extensively, another word
you found a really cool

442
00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:59.850
format that you liked. And
we also wanted to stick

443
00:21:59.850 --> 00:22:01.740
in a tweet button in
there and like a Facebook

444
00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:04.050
button. And some of those
things are, are simple to

445
00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:06.750
do tumbler, let us do
that. But other other places

446
00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:08.940
like WordPress and so on,
won't allow you to embed

447
00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:11.790
script tags for obvious reasons,
right? They don't want you

448
00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:16.350
to hijack such. And so,
you know, there's, there's restrictions

449
00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:18.150
out there and I think
you and I are hands

450
00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:21.000
on control freaks, right? So
having our own deal, we

451
00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:24.510
both have servers we have
access to. So the, this

452
00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:27.600
is just too compelling. I
mean, when you agree, It

453
00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:30.150
sure seemed interesting. Really simple
to me. I mean, I

454
00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:32.820
realized we could have picked
a number of places, but

455
00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:35.940
like I said, we have
total control. It's one click

456
00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:39.660
to publish it's it's lightweight.
It was fun. That's one

457
00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:41.080
of the things, I mean,
it's, it's silly again. You,

458
00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:44.040
you, you, you have to
try it yourself. I think.

459
00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:46.800
Well, one of the moments
for me that I thought

460
00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:50.280
was insanely compelling was last
night, right? When we pushed

461
00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:53.730
the site, we're trying to
tweak some CSS specifically with

462
00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:58.140
a mobile theme. And I
was holding my iPhone up

463
00:22:58.170 --> 00:23:02.430
to the video camera through
Skype while you're changing files

464
00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:06.000
through Dropbox and web matrix.
It's just that mix of

465
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.350
technology that was going together
seamlessly, quickly deployment. I was

466
00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:12.480
just literally that moment for
me was one of the

467
00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:15.540
funnest moments I've had programming
in the last six months.

468
00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:17.250
I mean, that says something
about what it is. We're

469
00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:19.050
doing the fact that we
could grease the wheels that

470
00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:22.650
quickly to get HTML up
so I can hit refresh

471
00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:24.600
on my iPhone. Yeah. It
was pretty funny. We were

472
00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:26.940
in Dropbox, I would type
a bunch of stuff in

473
00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:31.740
the mobile view, hit publish.
He would see Dropbox say

474
00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:34.950
reload at the same time
it's being updated in, on

475
00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:37.230
your site. And then you
hit refresh on your iPhone

476
00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:38.700
so that I can see
it from, yeah. It was

477
00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:41.280
pretty silly Fun thing about
that. Scott is something I

478
00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:44.220
was saying earlier, we're addressing
a business problem. We're not

479
00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:47.540
worrying about the technology, right.
We are right on the

480
00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:50.660
problem. How does our mobile
outlook right on it? Right.

481
00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:52.910
And we weren't thinking about
the code underneath it, but

482
00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:55.040
something else I wanted to
touch on really quickly is,

483
00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:59.180
you know, we talked about
the complex application and you

484
00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:01.040
know sure. Of course writing
a little CMS, like we

485
00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:03.920
did. It's not even really
a CMS, but that's easy,

486
00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:06.650
you know, would I write
tech pub on it? Somebody

487
00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:08.330
asked me, I think James,
would you write tech pub

488
00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:11.660
using web matrix? And sure,
I would, but you know,

489
00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:14.000
tech, but we actually have
some pretty deep technology that,

490
00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:16.670
you know, we have to
marry things up with Amazon

491
00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:20.060
subscriptions and so on, you
know, for that stuff, Hey,

492
00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:23.450
you know, kick up visual
studio. You, you write your

493
00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:25.490
logic in your domain model.
If you like put your

494
00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:28.760
decisions in there, but you
drop your, your DLL right.

495
00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:30.320
In the bin folder, just
like you would any other

496
00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:34.220
way. So you still have
your logic, but it's now

497
00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:37.040
encapsulated where it should be.
And you know, you can

498
00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:40.730
still develop it using visual
studio with web matrix just

499
00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:42.980
simply pays attention to the
front end. That's the way

500
00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:46.660
I like to look at
it at least. Do, Do

501
00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:48.760
you let's think about the
people who are listening to

502
00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:50.860
this that are like, Oh,
there go Scott and Rob

503
00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:52.600
with their new shiny toys,
you know, but I'm off,

504
00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:55.780
I'm off getting work done,
you know, you know. Yay.

505
00:24:55.810 --> 00:24:58.420
Good. Good for you guys.
What do you think that

506
00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:01.800
professional developer should know about
this thing? I mean, I,

507
00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:03.250
I'm gonna, like, I got
a buddy of mine. We

508
00:25:03.250 --> 00:25:04.870
do a little work on
the side occasionally and I'm

509
00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:08.530
going to show him this
and on I'll say, Hey,

510
00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:10.690
you know, this could be
for small sites. We want

511
00:25:10.690 --> 00:25:12.640
to put together. This can
be pretty, pretty easy, pretty

512
00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:15.970
lightweight, pretty fun. Are you
talking about expired foods.com? Yeah.

513
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.240
Maybe expired foods.com. That would
be good. That's a great

514
00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:21.580
business idea. We should quit
our jobs and we should

515
00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:24.340
do that right now. And,
and, and, but then he

516
00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:28.570
could actually give this web
matrix IDE potentially to the

517
00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:32.680
slightly technical, small business owner,
you know, all configured and

518
00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:36.160
set up and it runs
on XP and that person

519
00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:39.520
could kind of manage their
own little site. Sure. And

520
00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:42.430
just hit, publish. Yeah. I
mean, there's no reason you

521
00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:46.570
can't have, there's no reason
you can't have a complex

522
00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:51.310
domain model or whatever you
want in the backend. Heck

523
00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:53.460
there's no reason you can't
plumb in and hibernate or

524
00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:56.410
ETF if you needed to.
And then just have everything

525
00:25:56.410 --> 00:26:01.600
expressed visually through web matrix.
I think honestly, people's reactions

526
00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:03.580
are going to go along
a very typical route. We

527
00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:06.130
saw today on Twitter, or
I did at least with

528
00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:10.270
respect to code mash, some
pretty intensely negative reactions. You

529
00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:12.970
know, people are gonna look
at this as a validation

530
00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:16.840
or invalidation of themselves as
a programmer. Right. Why, why,

531
00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:18.970
why, why do you think?
Because like people are saying,

532
00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.400
Oh, we're going backwards now.
You know, shouldn't we be

533
00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:24.790
going forwards into the future
with shiny new things, right.

534
00:26:24.790 --> 00:26:28.000
We're going sideways. We'll, we're
going wherever. W we're actually

535
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.240
getting closer to the technology
that we should understand. I

536
00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:33.940
think if people can like,
cause I had this reaction

537
00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:36.880
to, and I'm, as you
know, I'm completely saying Mia

538
00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:39.850
culpa, I should have given
web matrix a little bit

539
00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:44.130
more of a nod comes
out. I say, okay, well

540
00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:47.130
I'll just try it. And
within five minutes I was,

541
00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:51.660
I was blissfully and happily
hooked. And I think most

542
00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:53.880
developers out there, if they're
willing to just give it

543
00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:55.560
a try, and this is
where I get my shill

544
00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:57.810
hat and put it on
my head. If they're willing

545
00:26:57.810 --> 00:27:02.950
to give it a try,
it's absolutely intoxicating. And I,

546
00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:04.740
I pretty much think they're
going to not want to

547
00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:07.890
go back. And this is
why I get to take

548
00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:10.470
my shell hat off and
say any alternative visual studio

549
00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:15.170
is good. Well, you, you,
you still do work on

550
00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:17.280
the side. You do work
on the side as you're

551
00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:19.450
going as a consultant. When
you're not doing tech pups

552
00:27:19.450 --> 00:27:22.160
stuff, you do Ruby and
you do.net for money. Are

553
00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:23.660
you going to charge, you're
going to charge people for

554
00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:27.470
web matrix work? Well, you
know, it's funny. I, I,

555
00:27:27.530 --> 00:27:30.290
that's, all I do contract
work is, is.net stuff. So

556
00:27:30.290 --> 00:27:32.210
when I'm not doing tech
pub and other things, and

557
00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:36.410
that's all I do. And
my client, one of my

558
00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:38.630
clients called me the other
day and asked about this

559
00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:43.640
project. They're thinking of doing,
and he's actually, they're a

560
00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:45.710
big enterprise. And they use
VB. He asked me to

561
00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:48.320
do it in VB. And
I, I said, I don't

562
00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:50.840
know, VB, well enough, I
can show you C-sharp. And

563
00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:52.370
we kind of had that
debate, which I'm sure a

564
00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:54.860
lot of consultants out there
are used to. I said,

565
00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:56.960
well, you know, actually a
really cool alternative is web

566
00:27:56.960 --> 00:28:01.010
matrix. Really the only code
you need to understand is

567
00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:04.700
razor. There's some light see
sharpness to it, but you

568
00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:07.730
really don't need to get
too deep into what it

569
00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:10.070
is you're doing. And you
know, we haven't even touched

570
00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:13.010
on the package stuff that's
available, you know, like the

571
00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:15.470
quick edit. Yeah, Yeah, yeah.
But actually let's, let's let's

572
00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:17.000
back up. Cause I think
you just said something very,

573
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.420
very important that what, what
matrix is the IDE right.

574
00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:22.700
And the web pages, I
guess, is what they're calling

575
00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:24.470
it, you know, dot net
web pages. But on that

576
00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:28.130
web pages, it's effectively raiser.
Right? It's all, it's kind

577
00:28:28.130 --> 00:28:31.340
of, it's all MVC underneath
this thing, right? It's just

578
00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:35.180
a way to express that
it's basically views. It's only

579
00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:39.350
views, right? It's not MVC.
It's just V yeah. But

580
00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:41.300
it's the same razor syntax
that you might already know

581
00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:44.300
if you've been playing with
asp.net MVC three and since

582
00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:48.410
razor, this is the funny
thing about razor actually internally,

583
00:28:48.410 --> 00:28:50.960
while they were arguing about
what the syntax should be.

584
00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:53.810
There was all the design
decisions and people trying to

585
00:28:53.810 --> 00:28:55.760
figure out what the simplest
way. And it was all

586
00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:58.250
optimized to have the fewest
number of characters, you know,

587
00:28:58.250 --> 00:29:03.020
to say something, I kept
getting my eyes blur and

588
00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:04.880
kind of go cross side.
When I was trying to

589
00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:08.840
figure out what the syntax
rules were for razor and

590
00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:11.360
tell, someone said, stop thinking
about it, just type an

591
00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:14.270
add sign and start writing
code. And then I realized

592
00:29:14.410 --> 00:29:16.610
that there really is no
razor. You know what I

593
00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:20.030
mean? It's like, it's just,
it's just the same stuff.

594
00:29:20.030 --> 00:29:21.650
It's the same code as
I've been writing all the

595
00:29:21.650 --> 00:29:24.920
time. Well, it's kind of
funny. Yeah. Yesterday when you

596
00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:27.320
and I were coding, like
the helper syntax is to

597
00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:32.210
me, I found to be
really scripty and actually jarring.

598
00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:34.970
It reminded me of writing
include functions in ASP classic.

599
00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:39.110
And you, you know, you,
you kick out these helpers

600
00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:42.010
and when you were writing
the methods, you kept return,

601
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:44.890
you know, like return. That's
true. Yeah, dude, it's a

602
00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:47.770
helper. What does that mean?
Well, it's just, it's text

603
00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:49.870
right there. There's a void.
It just depends in the

604
00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:53.410
response. You know? And, and
it's kind of funny cause

605
00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:56.080
you do have to wind
your brain back into scripting

606
00:29:56.110 --> 00:29:58.990
thinking. Hmm. It is still
C sharp. But the interesting

607
00:29:58.990 --> 00:30:01.570
thing about it is it's
sort of C sharp light,

608
00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:04.360
which is interesting to me
because it's full use of

609
00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:08.800
dynamic. And I actually had
this discussion with John Galloway six

610
00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:11.310
months ago and I said,
wouldn't it be funny that

611
00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:12.970
YouTube, as a matter of
fact, I wouldn't have actually

612
00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:16.660
thought about writing this, but
doing an entire asp.net MVC

613
00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:20.170
project with nothing but dynamic
the model, everything would be

614
00:30:20.170 --> 00:30:22.990
dynamic. Everything sent to the
page that it is. And

615
00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:25.240
lo and behold, that's what
we matrix is. Right. It's

616
00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:28.710
really funny. So I mean,
it's four, It is certainly

617
00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:31.200
appropriate for the people that
they're kind of quote unquote

618
00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:33.900
selling it to it's free,
but they're the college students,

619
00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:36.090
the lightweight scripters folks that
want to get stuff done.

620
00:30:36.450 --> 00:30:39.990
But you're saying for the
advanced developer who wishes, things

621
00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:43.710
were more dynamic were more
loose, were more flexible. You

622
00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:45.210
know, what are the, you
know, the guys that are

623
00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:49.380
like looking over the fence
at Ruby wishing, you know,

624
00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:52.800
or, or feeling like Whoa,
rails is so similar, Sinatra's

625
00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:56.160
so compelling. Hey, I think
there's, there's a lot to

626
00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:58.650
be said about this web
matrix experience. I mean, I

627
00:30:58.650 --> 00:31:01.440
will say that I don't
think C-sharp is a very

628
00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:06.540
compelling web development language. However,
C sharp for, with dynamic

629
00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:10.650
is, is pretty neat. It's
pretty interesting. It, I was

630
00:31:10.650 --> 00:31:12.960
trying to explain it to
somebody that if you like

631
00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:16.680
dynamic programming, like if you'd
like Ruby and Python, you

632
00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:21.420
can quite easily find yourself
coding you C sharp in

633
00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:24.480
that same way. Like duct
typing. Well, Actually, you know,

634
00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:26.160
one thing that was funny
was that when you handed

635
00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:30.420
me the code, you were
doing two things I think

636
00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:32.490
are interesting. That might be
interesting to the listener. First

637
00:31:32.490 --> 00:31:36.930
thing under posts, we basically
have the, HTMA have a

638
00:31:36.930 --> 00:31:39.450
folder called post and we
have the HTML for each

639
00:31:39.450 --> 00:31:41.940
of our shows. So the,
if you hit, you know,

640
00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:44.010
this developer's life and you
click on a show like

641
00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:47.850
I'm getting fired. Our first
show, that's actually a file

642
00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:51.130
on disc. That's like one
Oh one getting fired dot

643
00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:55.620
CSS, HTML. And in that
file, you had basically two

644
00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:57.870
lines. You would set the
layout and then you would

645
00:31:57.870 --> 00:31:59.820
go and you'd get the
show out of the database.

646
00:32:00.210 --> 00:32:02.430
And you put it into
something that was called page

647
00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:05.340
data. And you basically put
it in there so that

648
00:32:05.370 --> 00:32:08.160
other pages and other helpers
and other things could pull

649
00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:11.400
that bit of context out.
You, you did a very

650
00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:15.900
dot Nettie thing. You said,
page data, square bracket. And

651
00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:18.300
then you went in, you
know, an indexer and you

652
00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:20.730
put the data in there
payday to quote some stuff.

653
00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:24.840
But then I was talking
to Damien, he said, Hey,

654
00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:26.310
why are you doing that?
Sorry, I don't know. I

655
00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:28.080
mean, isn't that what you
put stuff? It's like session

656
00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:31.650
quote or cash quote. He
says, no. Well, the page

657
00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:36.330
object is that dynamic page
dot, whatever. So I just

658
00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:40.910
said really? I said, okay,
page show equals shows dot

659
00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:46.460
find. And then the line
where we were a passing

660
00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:49.520
in the slug, I just
said, request a URL. And

661
00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:54.890
then another, another brain, what's
the word, like a shift

662
00:32:54.890 --> 00:32:58.370
in my thinking, I was
looking in the help for

663
00:32:58.370 --> 00:33:00.800
how to get the last
bit of a URL segment.

664
00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:05.450
Right? It's an array request
dot URL dot segments. And

665
00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:08.480
I'm like thinking old school,
right? I'm thinking old school.

666
00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:11.420
C-sharp, I'm messing around and
like, okay, length dot, you

667
00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:16.070
know, Earl dot segments at
URL dot segments dot length

668
00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:20.330
minus once that, and then
again reminded by a smarter

669
00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:23.600
people than I, this is
a C-sharp foreign link. And

670
00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:26.390
I can just say dot
last. So those little bit

671
00:33:26.390 --> 00:33:29.780
of syntactic sugar that I
always am jealous about when

672
00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:33.470
I talked to rubious is
slowly, slowly making its way

673
00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:36.110
into the end of the
language. So then suddenly I

674
00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:38.030
didn't have to hard code
the URL. I pulled it

675
00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:40.010
right out of the segments,
segments dot last. I mean,

676
00:33:40.010 --> 00:33:42.650
that's just, that was fun
actually. And then once we

677
00:33:42.650 --> 00:33:46.520
put that in, once we
realized page was dynamic, then

678
00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:48.530
we went back and started
deleting stuff. You know, things

679
00:33:48.530 --> 00:33:52.090
just got simpler. It was
a Very, yeah. And I

680
00:33:52.090 --> 00:33:54.400
think you went through, I
remember, you know, you were

681
00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:58.090
telling me afterwards, you were
just like, this is horrid

682
00:33:58.270 --> 00:34:00.100
you're or I forgot exactly
what you were like, this

683
00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:03.550
is just get it done.
Throw stuff against the wall.

684
00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:05.200
You know, like Scott man,
come on, we got a

685
00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:08.050
good site and it works.
And you're deleting code. That's

686
00:34:08.050 --> 00:34:10.360
the way it should be.
But yet you felt uncomfortable.

687
00:34:10.930 --> 00:34:13.090
I think a lot, a
lot of developers are gonna

688
00:34:13.090 --> 00:34:15.130
feel that way. I felt
weird When you gave it

689
00:34:15.130 --> 00:34:18.130
to me first, because it
seemed, I kept thinking I

690
00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:19.210
could have done it this
way. I couldn't have done

691
00:34:19.210 --> 00:34:21.490
it that way. But then
I remembered, like you said,

692
00:34:21.490 --> 00:34:24.160
the business problem for us,
which was we need a

693
00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:27.280
way to easily publish shows.
It can't be a complicated

694
00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:30.820
thing. We need kind of
infinite flexibility in the way

695
00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:34.180
that we do our page
layout. And we want a

696
00:34:34.180 --> 00:34:36.340
tiny database, but we don't
want to pay for SQL

697
00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:39.790
server. So we use SQL
compact. We want it to

698
00:34:39.790 --> 00:34:43.180
cash and we've got, and
again, it's all on asp.net.

699
00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:45.220
And that's the other thing
like, remember yesterday when you

700
00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:47.410
handed it to me, it,
you just went to the

701
00:34:47.410 --> 00:34:49.840
database directly. We were trying
to figure out, well, what's

702
00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:52.210
it going to take to,
to do caching and stuff?

703
00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:55.240
Well, there's a helper called
web cache and it was

704
00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:58.060
like web cash dot get,
if it came back, no,

705
00:34:58.060 --> 00:34:59.950
go to the database. I
mean, we added caching, I

706
00:34:59.950 --> 00:35:05.740
think in like two minutes
and it's done, it just

707
00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:09.970
worked. You know, this whole
experience reminds me of a,

708
00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:13.000
an interesting debate. My wife
and I had when we

709
00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.670
were on the big Island
over the holidays, we went

710
00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:17.500
over there. My wife wanted
to go running, but she

711
00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:20.980
had forgotten her, her running
shoes. And I said, well,

712
00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:24.010
you know, just go barefoot.
And she laughed at me

713
00:35:24.010 --> 00:35:27.850
and I said, you know,
seriously, the human body is

714
00:35:27.850 --> 00:35:31.360
built to run. Probably not
long distances, but you know

715
00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:33.340
what they always say. If
you look at a cat's

716
00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:37.800
leg, it's got three joints
on it. Really the leg,

717
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:40.590
the thing they run on
is actually their toes and

718
00:35:40.590 --> 00:35:42.480
most animals are built that
way. And he said, just

719
00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:44.850
run on your toes. And
we got into this argument

720
00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:47.880
in science and biology. My
wife is a, she studies

721
00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:50.460
medicine and so on. So
she of course felt violated

722
00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:53.040
with his story. And he
said, no, come on. So

723
00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:55.470
she wouldn't do it. So
I go to the running

724
00:35:55.470 --> 00:35:57.210
shoe store, cause I'm going
to buy her some nice,

725
00:35:57.210 --> 00:36:00.260
expensive running shoes. And we
get there. And the guy

726
00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:05.130
says, have you seen these
new Vibram fingers, five fingers?

727
00:36:05.130 --> 00:36:07.620
Right? And I said, well,
yeah, those are pretty cool.

728
00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:10.230
They're for hiking. He's like,
no, they're running. And, and

729
00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:12.510
I said, you're kidding me.
And they have running toe

730
00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:15.420
shoes. And the guy said
at the, at the Honolulu

731
00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:18.720
marathon this year over a
third of the runners are,

732
00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:24.380
are wearing these shoes. $50
toe shoes. And Clear are

733
00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:27.320
like, literally they look like
slippers and they have toes.

734
00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:28.970
So there's like a slot
for each of your toes.

735
00:36:28.970 --> 00:36:30.950
It's not a shoe as
it is a, a rough

736
00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:34.820
sock with a sole. Yeah.
And the guy, the guy

737
00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:36.830
said to me, something that
I just loved, he said,

738
00:36:37.370 --> 00:36:41.060
your body is built to
do these things. This just

739
00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:43.130
protects the bottom of your
foot. Your body does the

740
00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:45.350
rest. You don't need these
running shoes. And if you

741
00:36:45.350 --> 00:36:47.420
think about it, tying it
back into what we're doing.

742
00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:50.180
I mean, running shoes are
an abstraction. And what they

743
00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:53.180
actually ended up doing is
making you run wrong because

744
00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:54.830
you land on your heel,
you end up injuring your

745
00:36:54.830 --> 00:36:57.320
knees and your legs. And
pretty soon your body just,

746
00:36:57.590 --> 00:37:00.800
just, just implodes. Whereas, you
know, the things that we've

747
00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:04.460
been talking about today, HTML,
sequel, I mean, ACDP right.

748
00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:09.380
Understanding these things, embracing them.
I mean, you know, the

749
00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:12.020
web is built to run,
right? These things are built

750
00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:15.200
to do what they do
and perhaps removing the running

751
00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:17.660
shoes. It really is a
good feeling. And I'll tell

752
00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:19.130
you what, when I put
those shoes on, I bought

753
00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:21.800
a pair for myself and
I ran around. I felt

754
00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:24.770
like a little kid. It
was wonderful. End of story.

755
00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:27.920
All right. Let me ask
you this in closing then

756
00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:31.010
if you're out there and
you're using web forms now,

757
00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:35.510
and you're looking at NVC
and now we've introduced yet

758
00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:39.050
another thing, right? Remember my
whole car versus motorcycle analogy,

759
00:37:39.050 --> 00:37:42.740
right? There are there's room
for different kinds of vehicles

760
00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:45.260
out there, right? If, if
web forms is a, is

761
00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:49.760
a car and MVC is
a motorcycle, maybe web matrix

762
00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:54.440
is a little hybrid scooter.
Do you know? This could

763
00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:56.510
confuse a lot of people
that really just want to

764
00:37:56.510 --> 00:37:59.240
go from place to place.
Should web forms. People be

765
00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:02.030
freaking out like, you know,
this new thing is out

766
00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:04.010
there or is this just
like more tools for the

767
00:38:04.010 --> 00:38:08.240
toolbox? You know, it's, it's
interesting. Have you, you have

768
00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:12.380
a bike, right? A bicycle.
Yeah. Have you ever sat

769
00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:14.810
on one of those high
end road bikes? You sat

770
00:38:14.810 --> 00:38:17.030
on the seat. I have,
my brother has one of

771
00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:19.070
those. He has, his bicycle
is worth more than his

772
00:38:19.070 --> 00:38:21.530
car, right? So if you
look at the seats, they're

773
00:38:21.530 --> 00:38:24.050
like a little piece of
wood. I mean, they really

774
00:38:24.050 --> 00:38:26.960
it's just so uncomfortable, but
it's not made to be

775
00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:29.450
sat in. You're made to
feel the road. There's no

776
00:38:29.450 --> 00:38:32.450
shock absorbers. There's no, nothing.
My point here is that

777
00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:36.280
the first thing to overcome,
if you're about changing off

778
00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:39.460
of web forms, let's use
that specifically just to overcome

779
00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:42.400
the fear of change and
to understand, to be willing,

780
00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:45.730
to learn what it means.
You know, what, what it

781
00:38:45.730 --> 00:38:48.850
is that web forums has
been abstracting. And then once

782
00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:51.370
you kind of say, okay,
see how it matrix is,

783
00:38:51.370 --> 00:38:55.690
embracing it again. Don't stop
there. Keep going to other

784
00:38:55.690 --> 00:38:59.680
technologies and learn, just learn,
learn what's out there. See,

785
00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:01.630
this is why I get
to stop being a shelter.

786
00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.940
All right. Well, you're obviously
religiously excited about this and

787
00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:08.610
I think that your excitement
is infectious. You've got me,

788
00:39:08.610 --> 00:39:10.980
at least making, I've made
now one site with you,

789
00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:13.530
I'm going to start playing
more with a web matrix.

790
00:39:13.530 --> 00:39:14.610
And I guess you're going
to blog about it a

791
00:39:14.610 --> 00:39:16.770
little bit more, not blog
about some of the code

792
00:39:16.770 --> 00:39:20.700
that we wrote and we'll
all continue to learn. Yay

793
00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:22.980
and kudos to Microsoft for
going in this direction. I've

794
00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:26.520
really, really am amazed. Very
cool. Alright. Thank you so

795
00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:29.280
much. My good friend, Rob,
and this has been another

796
00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:32.160
episode of Hanselminutes and we'll
put in a plug for

797
00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:36.780
our other podcast. Check out
this developer's life.com. See you

798
00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:39.600
next week. Hey, I have
a question before we go.

799
00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:42.540
Have I been on this
podcast more than Rory black?

800
00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:45.570
Yeah, No. Yeah. You've been
on more than Rory at

801
00:39:45.570 --> 00:39:48.480
