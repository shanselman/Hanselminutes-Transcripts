developer and technologist Scott Hanselman.
This is Lawrence Ryan And announcing

10
00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.150
show number 525. In this
episode, Scott talks with Nadia

11
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:09.710
egg ball about how open
source software gets funded. Hi,

12
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.780
this is Scott Hanselman. This
is another episode of Hansel

13
00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.600
minutes today. We're talking about
funding open source and how

14
00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.390
open source gets funded with
Nadia Eric Ball. How are you?

15
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.170
I'm good. So you're an
independent researcher and right now

16
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.860
you're, you're founded by the
Ford foundation. How long have

17
00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.430
you been exploring how, how
people and how projects get

18
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.760
funding Long time, I guess
over the course of a

19
00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:37.340
lot of different jobs and
career trajectories, this most recent

20
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.730
exploration has been going on
various forums since last summer.

21
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.960
And I've really dived into
open source specifically, I'd say

22
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.700
since the last fall or
so, But you've done business

23
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.640
analysis, you've done product strategy.
And you were yourself a

24
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.030
cofounder when you were co
founding your own company. Did

25
00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.180
you go looking for money?
Yeah, we did. We did.

26
00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.280
And we participated in an
accelerator called 500 startups. Were

27
00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.730
you using open source as
part of your company? Definitely.

28
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.910
I think that was my
first introduction to it was

29
00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.090
using all these different open
source libraries and frameworks and

30
00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.300
languages to build our products
and just being like, wow,

31
00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.340
this is great. We can
build a whole business using

32
00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.370
all these tools that are
at, at our disposal. And

33
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.830
from there starting to wonder
how does this, all this

34
00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.830
stuff get supported and where
does it come from? Was

35
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.690
that, was that challenging? I
mean, I understand that sometimes

36
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.120
people think of licensing as
being challenging, but was, was

37
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.550
it hard to put all
of those Lego pieces together

38
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.330
as well? I think it
was actually pretty easy, cause

39
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.270
I was, I mean, I
wouldn't call myself a highly

40
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.870
skilled developer as a starter
calling things along as we

41
00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.170
went. And so having a
bunch of things that I

42
00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.150
could already use instead of
having to figure it all

43
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.600
out on my own, having
to build less stuff on

44
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.430
my own, just made it
a lot easier to get

45
00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.220
up and going. But what
about, you know, plugging things

46
00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.020
in technology technologically is different
than playing them in license

47
00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.970
wide. Like, you know, we
might say this is a

48
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.350
great piece of software and
this is a great piece

49
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.600
of software, but this one's
GPL and we're not going

50
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.390
to use that in our
startup or, Yeah, I don't

51
00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.870
think we even thought about
licenses back then. And I

52
00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.460
think a lot of people,
it's sort of like a

53
00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.250
thing I've noticed with a
lot of developers now that

54
00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.440
I've talked to is a
lot of people aren't as

55
00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.920
concerned about licenses or aren't
even really familiar with what

56
00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.750
all the different ones are.
And they just think, well,

57
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.670
if it's on GitHub, it
must be opensource, which is

58
00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.730
not true. But I think
it sort of reflects that

59
00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.480
attitude that we have now
in terms of using open

60
00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.450
source technology, where it's just,
you see it as something

61
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.150
that's free and available and
you can kind of pick

62
00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.250
it up and use it.
And so there's a little

63
00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.450
bit of a tension now,
I think, between what licenses

64
00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.860
meant for open source and
free software, you know, back

65
00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.190
in the eighties or, and,
and now it's sort of

66
00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.010
like the default rate, But
isn't that kind of a

67
00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.100
problem. I mean, we can't
just slap stuff together. It's

68
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.440
really kind of exciting slash
scary that you said that

69
00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.660
the folks that you talked
to you don't give that

70
00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.790
much thought. Yeah. I mean,
it's something like, I think

71
00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.200
15% of GitHub repos have
a license on them, which

72
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.030
is not that much. And
I know there are a

73
00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.370
lot of personal projects on
GitHub and you know, not

74
00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.120
everything needs a license either,
I guess, but yeah, I

75
00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.120
think it just, it reflects
his attitude of, you know,

76
00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.000
I'm going to default to
giving something away and not

77
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.390
think of it as a
special circumstance. And so, yeah.

78
00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.100
I mean, it's, I guess
it's an interesting tension in

79
00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:34.200
that. It's cool to see
that culturally it's we're, you

80
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.260
know, we're seeing open source
is the norm, right. But

81
00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.840
in the end you still
have the law and you

82
00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.020
still have to answer to
somebody. And so you seem,

83
00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.390
I think like get hub
is probably trying to figure

84
00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:48.960
out how to address that
and stack overflow right now.

85
00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.900
I don't know if you
follow their license thing. They

86
00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.510
use creative commons. Yeah. They
use creative comments and they're

87
00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.970
trying to switch to, I
think at MIT license last,

88
00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.120
I was following it, but
trying to grapple with that

89
00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.180
because yeah. Code that's licensed
under creative comments is sort

90
00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.140
of, I guess, just like
not really used, it's sort

91
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.900
of a weird license. Yeah.
Creative commons doesn't really lend

92
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.610
it to you. It thinks
about pros, I think more

93
00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.680
than Yeah. And there was
sort of like requirements of

94
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.060
attribution and things like that,
but it's yeah, it's sort

95
00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.860
of funny, I guess. Cause
they could go, they could

96
00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.530
have gone a really long
time and not really thought

97
00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.330
about or address the license
issue. And I think it's

98
00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.070
gotten to the point where
so many people are using

99
00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.560
these things. It's like, yeah.
How do we deal with

100
00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.410
this legally? What does it
mean? And I think there

101
00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:33.960
was like, I haven't followed
what happened with Sacra flow

102
00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.820
recently, but I know that
they were trying to figure

103
00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.990
out like what happens to
code that was under the

104
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.620
creative commons license before they
can't like retroactively apply a

105
00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.130
license. So do you have
like two different licenses on

106
00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:48.990
the site and how do
people know? Which is which,

107
00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.110
and it just gets very
complicated quickly. No one really

108
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.560
likes thinking about legal stuff,
but it's, you know, we're

109
00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.890
all kind of subject to
the law, right? Yeah. Yeah.

110
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.760
I think what happened was
the stack overflow decided that

111
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.570
not public domain was an
explicit thing. People were just

112
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:09.350
assuming I found it and
that's okay. As I understand

113
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.760
it, attribution is required when
you use code at stack

114
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.760
overflow. So if you, even
if there's no clear license,

115
00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.110
if you go and use
it, you copy paste that

116
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:19.640
you have to say, I
got this from stack overflow,

117
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:22.580
which that really right away
changes people copy pasting code.

118
00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:28.150
And that went into, into
effect on the 1st of March. Yeah.

119
00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:29.740
I think that's the last
time, the last thing that

120
00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.690
I saw from it. And
it's interesting to think about

121
00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:34.600
with like companies and stuff
and companies are trying to

122
00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:38.560
mirror opensource practices even internally.
And so if you're a

123
00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.840
developer and you're just used
to using stack overflow in

124
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:42.910
your own projects and then
suddenly it's like, well at

125
00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:45.400
work, we can't do this
or now, you know, it's

126
00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.910
like requiring attribution in company
code is sort of weird

127
00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:51.700
and how do you deal
with all of them? So

128
00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:53.890
people, if you look at
the stack overflow question, people

129
00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:57.730
are going insane and it's
been downloaded to oblivion and

130
00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.280
it seems totally reasonable that
like attribution in all things,

131
00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.260
even if I try to
tweet something, I, if there's,

132
00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:03.850
you know, if there's ever
a room, I try to

133
00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:07.420
attribute. Yeah. I think it's
just, I think that that

134
00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:10.000
sort of highlights that awkward
tension right now. Right. Where

135
00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:15.010
from the developer's perspective, it's
sorta like, you know, code

136
00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:17.290
belongs to everybody and why
should we have to think

137
00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:19.720
about who to attribute things
to or not. And then

138
00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.300
from the legal perspective, of
course it makes sense that

139
00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.120
stack overflow or anyone else
in that position would, you

140
00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:29.710
know, want to cover all
their bases and everything. And

141
00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:30.700
so, yeah. I mean, it's
just sort of like a

142
00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.890
really weird time and I
think it's, it's cool to

143
00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:34.780
look at it cause it's
like we're in this cultural

144
00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:37.150
inflection point, right? We're the
stuff has to get sorted

145
00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:40.810
out somehow. Yeah, totally. I
think that they're probably covering

146
00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:45.070
their own butts too, because
someone could conceivably, I'm just

147
00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.130
thinking about an overzealous lawyer,
Sue stack overflow, because something

148
00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:50.560
bad happened, even though they
were just the holder of

149
00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:52.540
the code. One thing I
wanted to mention is that

150
00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:56.290
you talked about how 15%
of GitHub repos or thereabouts

151
00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:59.860
have licenses. There's a lovely
website. They put up called

152
00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:03.310
choose a licensed.com. Yep. And
he did it, I think,

153
00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:06.220
partially in response to that
study, I think it was

154
00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:10.690
SFLC that did that study
that said it was like

155
00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:13.960
15% of reposts have a
license and then 2013, I

156
00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.450
think. And then it was
sort of like in response

157
00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:19.720
to that, that get home,
put up that microsite. And

158
00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.120
then they started offering, I
think when you create a

159
00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.610
new repo, now they suggest
a license and just try

160
00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:27.520
to be a little bit
more encouraging to help people

161
00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:30.610
think it through. And yeah,
it shouldn't be the scary,

162
00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:33.220
you know, there's like only
a couple of licenses that

163
00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:35.710
are really commonly used. And
I think that site does

164
00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:38.020
a great job breaking down
the pros and cons very

165
00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:42.070
easily. Definitely. It's not exactly
a flow chart and certainly

166
00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:44.770
talk to a lawyer. But
if you've got a bunch

167
00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:46.660
of little small samples that
you wrote in a couple

168
00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:49.480
of hours or a little
minor things and licensed them.

169
00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:54.460
Yeah. So those things, those
little pieces of code that

170
00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:57.570
may necessarily be the essence
of our software, but they

171
00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:01.470
might be the software around
our software. You could call

172
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:04.710
that open source infrastructure and
you wrote a wonderful post

173
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:07.110
about that. Could you explain
what open source infrastructure is?

174
00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:11.450
Yeah. I think to preface
that we're still all trying

175
00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:14.060
to figure out what the
right vocabulary is. And so

176
00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:16.760
I've, I've ended up settling
on the term open source

177
00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:19.490
infrastructure for now, but I
think has sort of this

178
00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:22.880
collaborative process where no one
really knows what the final

179
00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:27.350
vocabulary will be, but I've
tacked on the term infrastructure

180
00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:30.830
to distinguish from every other
kind of open source project.

181
00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:33.440
Just to kind of point
to the way I define

182
00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.990
it as projects that are
being used to build other

183
00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:39.590
software. So that kind of
like all the components that

184
00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:42.410
you need to build software
like languages or frameworks or

185
00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:46.550
databases or libraries and things
like that, which is different

186
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:50.510
from say an consumer facing
app that happens to also

187
00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:53.750
be open source. And so
it's interesting because there are

188
00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:57.680
changes that are affecting everybody
in open source where the

189
00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.320
definition of open source itself
is changing. I think a

190
00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.390
lot of people are using
the term open source to

191
00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:05.930
refer to anything that's open
or anything that's published, whether

192
00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:08.030
it's, you could open source
of book or something. Right.

193
00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:12.860
And that, I think, I
think there's just sort of

194
00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:15.830
like a lot of confusion
right now. What is opensource

195
00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:19.910
and, and maybe that's partially
why licenses, the license question

196
00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:22.850
is getting sort of like
pushed out a little bit.

197
00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:26.810
Cause people just think open
source equals open. Right. And

198
00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:28.880
there's still people who believe
that who not believe, but

199
00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:33.810
there's also the differentiation between
OSS and floss, you know?

200
00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:37.070
Totally. Yeah. And the term
that you use really matters.

201
00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:41.120
Right. So yeah, there's lots
of different terms floating around.

202
00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:44.480
And so I'm, I'm particularly
interested in infrastructure as a

203
00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:49.910
subset of opensource because I
think right now people are

204
00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.930
maybe sort of like comfortable
about open source in the

205
00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:56.270
sense of thinking, you know,
we, we, we like to

206
00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:57.950
see the best of open
source, right? Like we like

207
00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:01.970
seeing that it's a volunteer
based effort and people are

208
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.950
kind of like giving of
their own accord. It's a

209
00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:07.280
place where creativity thrives and
it's sort of like this

210
00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:12.050
self-supporting anarchic looking system from
the outside. And so there,

211
00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:15.050
isn't a lot of motivation
I guess, to look deeper

212
00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:18.470
and say, well, is it
really being well supported? It's

213
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:23.660
worked really well for the
past three, four decades, but

214
00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:25.820
things are changing right now
too. And there's so much

215
00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:31.400
more demand and pressure on
infrastructure to support like everything

216
00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:34.370
else in software, because open
source is being used everywhere.

217
00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:38.390
And you know, is that
infrastructure, is it, is it

218
00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:41.480
reasonable to expect that it
infrastructure gets supported by volunteers

219
00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:43.790
or has the time kind
of come to start thinking

220
00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:45.770
about how we can support
it a little bit more

221
00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:50.870
institutionally? Yeah. Yeah. You mentioned
when you were asking yourself

222
00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:53.590
the question, well is an
opensource fine. Like there's no

223
00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:56.830
surely there's no health problem
in open source. It's well-funded.

224
00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.300
Yeah. And I think it's,
it's a nice image to

225
00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:02.520
think about if you're not
super familiar with open source,

226
00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:04.710
it's just like, Oh, I
know it's this warm and

227
00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:07.500
fuzzy thing where people will
make stuff and they put

228
00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:09.630
it out there and we
can use it. And you

229
00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:12.510
don't really think about or
hear about the maintenance and

230
00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:15.390
the hard work that goes
into it. There's I think

231
00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:17.790
a little bit more of
like a user mindset now

232
00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:21.930
than a community contributor mindset
where, and I felt this

233
00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:25.560
like as a new developer
myself, whereas just like, you're

234
00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:27.720
learning how to code and
someone tells you to download

235
00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.490
this library or put it
in your app and you're

236
00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:31.500
just like, great. I do
this thing and I can

237
00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:33.510
keep building what it was.
I was trying to build

238
00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:37.050
the first place. And you
don't always think about, well,

239
00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:38.730
there's a real human being
on the other side of

240
00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:42.630
that project. Who's, you know,
trying to keep up with

241
00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:46.950
the demand. And sometimes it's
just one person. Sometimes it's

242
00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:49.980
10 people, sometimes it's the
whole community, but there's there's

243
00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:53.460
lot going on under the
hood. I'm finding also that

244
00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:56.250
the long tail of open
source is very long. And

245
00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:59.700
by that, I mean, there's
a popular, open source project

246
00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:02.460
that we want to use
at Microsoft. And we want

247
00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:05.160
people to use. And they
were at, at its peak

248
00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:08.700
40 humans working on this
thing and it was very

249
00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:12.510
stable. And then now it's
time to update it for,

250
00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:14.760
you know, the new for
the new stuff. And it

251
00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:16.890
turns out there's only one
person left and he's not

252
00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:19.500
really interested in working on
it because he's got other

253
00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:22.470
things to do. Like why
is the person who created

254
00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:24.630
it two years ago? The
person who should be maintaining

255
00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:28.890
it today? And gosh, that's
a, that's a, an anchor

256
00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:32.910
around that person's leg. And
at the same time there's

257
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.690
emotions, if we go and
fork thing, right, right. Then

258
00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:38.880
we've taken over their space.
So like for example, I've

259
00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:41.940
got a video game for
babies. It's called baby smash

260
00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:43.440
and it's for little kids.
I made it for my

261
00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:47.520
son while my son is
10. Now, do I just

262
00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:49.740
abandon it? Do I let
it go? Do I let

263
00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:52.200
someone fork it? Well, I
really like having ownership over

264
00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:55.440
it. You know, all of
these issues multiplied many times,

265
00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:58.470
especially when thinking about real
software that makes real businesses

266
00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:03.660
run is really overwhelming, Fascinating
tension that we're seeing now.

267
00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:06.330
And we're kind of in
the age of the individual

268
00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:11.070
and the individual creator where
I think like people feel

269
00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:14.670
empowered to express themselves creatively,
to build up their own

270
00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:18.360
brands. You know, you have
like YouTube creators, YouTube brands,

271
00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:21.750
whatever. And you're kind of
like, you're an artist, right?

272
00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:24.240
And I think a lot
of people associate opensource work

273
00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:28.230
with that sense of artistry.
And so there's a part

274
00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:29.850
of me that's, you know,
really wants to uphold that

275
00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:31.890
idea of what we should
be supporting individuals. And we

276
00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:34.350
should, you know, if it's
someone's project, if it someone's

277
00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:37.620
baby, like, you know, you
can't mess with that. And

278
00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:40.350
then on the other hand,
what's I guess, awkward about

279
00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:43.830
open source infrastructure or I
guess a lot of open

280
00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:48.420
source projects that differs from
say visual art is people

281
00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:51.170
are using and relying on
that stuff. It's not like

282
00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:52.730
you look at a painting
and you appreciate it and

283
00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:55.070
you walk away, but, or
you listen to a song

284
00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:58.850
and, and you know, it's
a recording, but if you're

285
00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:00.860
using that stuff in your
software and you're trying to

286
00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:03.080
make sure things don't break
and somebody has to be

287
00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:07.940
maintaining that project. And then
yeah, it's like, it's, it's

288
00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:12.630
awkward because it's personal. Right.
And if you're the author,

289
00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:16.220
maybe you feel ownership over
the thing that you, you

290
00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:20.030
know, so lovingly created. And
at the same time open

291
00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:22.520
source is sort of rooted
in this idea of community

292
00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:25.400
ownership. And there is no
one person who owns a

293
00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:27.350
project and you're kind of
putting it out there and

294
00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:30.050
people are helping you build
up. People are contributing and

295
00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:32.660
all this stuff. And so
it's hard to reconcile. I

296
00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:36.830
think that community ethos of
open source with, especially I

297
00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:39.230
think for these like smaller
and more medium sized projects,

298
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:41.030
the reality that there is
like one or two people

299
00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:43.780
that are maintaining it, That
is a really interesting point.

300
00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:47.770
And I think it was
Noah Kantrowitz from, and I

301
00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:50.380
found his post from your
post. He spoke in Portland

302
00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:53.320
at opensource bridge about how
there was a time when

303
00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:56.380
there was the commons, you
know, capital T capital, C

304
00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:59.320
dot commons. And this is,
you know, 50% put the

305
00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:02.560
work in and 50% reap
the benefits, but now it's

306
00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:05.650
not unbalanced anymore. Lots of
people are reaping the benefits

307
00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:07.930
and very few people are
doing the work. Totally. Yeah.

308
00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:11.260
That can be really overwhelming.
So then the question, the

309
00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:14.110
obvious question is why don't
we just start charging money

310
00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:17.440
for open source? Yeah. I
mean, you could, I think

311
00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:22.480
there's gonna be fancy guests.
I mean, I think there's

312
00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:25.000
going to be some pushing
of the boundaries in terms

313
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.500
of what we've traditionally thought
open source means. I guess

314
00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:35.410
I think you've seen some
people advocating for paid licenses

315
00:16:35.410 --> 00:16:39.190
or, you know, default to
paid and then you pay

316
00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:42.100
for an open source license
or whatever it is, which

317
00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:46.150
are all just, they're like
interesting creative solutions. And it's

318
00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:49.840
hard, I think because open
source is rooted in free

319
00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:53.820
software, right? That's the movement
that proceeded it and, and

320
00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:56.830
it's rooted in this feeling
of like, you know, we're

321
00:16:56.830 --> 00:17:01.390
trying to give things away
for free. And, and I

322
00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:05.020
think that it's even a
good thing, right. But like

323
00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:09.070
that software is made free
and infrastructure is free so

324
00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:10.720
that we can kind of
pick it up and use

325
00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:14.620
it in our own projects.
And that's really cool because

326
00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:16.660
it's just a tool, right.
And you can use that

327
00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:19.060
tool to experiment and build
lots of really cool things,

328
00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:21.400
but there has to be
some sort of way to

329
00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:26.260
reconcile what, you know, a
very, very large software company,

330
00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:30.550
for example, that can afford
to give back and versus

331
00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:33.880
like a hobbyist developer, who's
using it for free. I

332
00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:36.550
don't know if charging it
for directly is going to

333
00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:41.440
be the answer to everything.
I'm just sort of excited

334
00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:43.360
that a lot of people
are experimenting with different models

335
00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:44.980
right now. I just think
that there's going to be

336
00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:49.260
new support sustainability models that
we haven't seen before are

337
00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:51.990
going to be emerging right
now. And like, who really

338
00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:54.810
knows what's gonna win out.
Right. I'm sort of agnostic

339
00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:59.000
about it. But yeah, One
of my, one of my

340
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.890
favorite quotes and one of
your medium posts, and I

341
00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:03.230
would encourage people to check
you out on medium was

342
00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:06.710
you said, by not charging
for open source infrastructure, we

343
00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:09.350
protect the right of anybody
with an internet connection to

344
00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:12.080
teach themselves how to code
and build. I think that's

345
00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:14.390
really important. Like when, if
there's a barrier to entry,

346
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:18.800
even five bucks, that's enough
to stop a nonzero percentage

347
00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:21.770
of people from making. Totally.
Yeah. I mean, you think

348
00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:26.240
about like all of these
coding schools or tutorials even,

349
00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:29.720
or whatever, they're all using
free resources to teach people.

350
00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:31.790
And that's really cool. Like
I learned how to code

351
00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:36.470
for free because I could
just download Ruby right. And

352
00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:38.660
learn on my computer at
home. And that's like, we

353
00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:40.880
kind of take that for
granted that, you know, someone

354
00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.670
were to charge to use
a language which has happened

355
00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:46.580
in the past. Right. That
would completely change how many

356
00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:48.440
people would learn and, and,
and sort of like the

357
00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:51.170
boom that we're seeing right
now with tech is partially

358
00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:53.480
because we gave people all
these free tools and said,

359
00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:57.110
like, go build stuff. So,
yeah. I mean, I think,

360
00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:59.180
I think like really, there's
just going to be different

361
00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:02.870
solutions for all different sorts
of projects and people in

362
00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:05.510
different situations. And I'm not
opposed to that. I don't

363
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:08.390
think that charging can solve
all the problems, but maybe

364
00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:12.020
you can solve a couple
of people's problems, Right? You

365
00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:14.780
point out that not charging
is good, not only for

366
00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:18.320
people who are learning, but
also for startups and Mark

367
00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:21.170
Suster. The VC says that,
you know, there was a

368
00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:23.510
time when half of your
money was for infrastructure and

369
00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:25.370
half of it was for
coding and launching. And now

370
00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:29.450
basically infrastructure software is free.
I launched my own little

371
00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:32.510
startup and I just literally
an hour and a half

372
00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:36.380
ago, did my taxes with
my partner, Greg and our

373
00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:40.580
total costs last year were
about $2,000. And it was

374
00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:45.320
basically, it was basically for
the Azure cloud time, you

375
00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:47.960
know, it was like three
computers running in the cloud

376
00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:50.030
for a year in three
different data centers across the

377
00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:52.820
world, you know, et cetera,
et cetera, a couple of

378
00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:56.420
thousand dollars for a year.
But I realized that we

379
00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:58.490
didn't pay for our development
tools. We didn't pay for

380
00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:00.500
our runtime. We didn't pay,
we used a bunch of

381
00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:04.490
open source software. Here's the,
here's the rub though. If

382
00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:06.950
something big broken one of
those open source pieces of

383
00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:10.010
software, would that be enough
to destroy our little startup?

384
00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:13.220
It could be, I think
it has destroyed other people's

385
00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:16.720
startups. I just read one.
Gosh, I can't remember what

386
00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:19.850
company it was. It was
some sort of like photo

387
00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:23.120
sharing app where you take
a picture and you like

388
00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:25.400
randomly send it to someone
around the world or something

389
00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:27.710
like that. This is like
a fun app. Right. But

390
00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:29.480
there isn't a whole bunch
of people using it. And

391
00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:31.850
I was reading about it
and they said that the

392
00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:34.700
reason it shut down was
because somebody was kind of

393
00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:37.610
like hacking into it to
show them what the vulnerabilities

394
00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:42.080
were. And so there were
like a bunch of vulnerabilities

395
00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:46.130
around it and, and the
people who developed it, I

396
00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:48.730
guess from my understanding, they
just didn't have the technical

397
00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:52.420
expertise to understand how to
address those vulnerabilities because they

398
00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:55.300
were using probably just a
bunch of open source software

399
00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:59.260
and cobbling things together. And
if someone kind of points

400
00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:01.180
out these issues, you're like,
I don't know, you know,

401
00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:03.460
and they ended up shutting
down the app because they

402
00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:04.780
were sort of like, well,
we know that there are

403
00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:07.840
all these like giant scary
loopholes. We have no idea

404
00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:10.900
how to resolve them. So
we're probably not the right

405
00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:13.420
people to do a photo
app, which is kind of

406
00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:15.250
a shame. I just want
to talk. I was at

407
00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:17.890
a conference last week and
someone's going to talk about

408
00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:21.700
junior developers and security in
particular. And I think like

409
00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:24.380
the story goes so beyond
security or whatever, but it's,

410
00:21:24.610 --> 00:21:27.180
I think it's an interesting
point that so many people

411
00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:31.120
will know how to code
now that aren't don't have

412
00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:32.650
it. They don't need to
have as deep of an

413
00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:35.590
understanding of everything they're doing
because they're using other people's

414
00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:38.440
tools. Right. And within each
of those tools are tons

415
00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:40.300
of vulnerabilities or just like
tons of things that could

416
00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:42.160
break and they don't understand
how to fix them or

417
00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:47.200
whatever. And it's hard cause
like you're really reliant on

418
00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:52.630
other people's projects and expertise
and infrastructure to make your

419
00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:55.810
own stuff work. And I
think that's like, that might

420
00:21:55.810 --> 00:21:58.180
be one of the best
arguments for why we need

421
00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:01.240
to come together in the
tech industry and support open

422
00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:04.210
source infrastructure because we're all
relying on somebody else's work

423
00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:06.400
and you don't know who
that person is. You don't

424
00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:09.520
know what their situation is.
We've seen a whole bunch

425
00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:12.810
of other, you know, security,
bugs and vulnerabilities found in

426
00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:16.480
other projects that we use.
And that's kinda scary, right?

427
00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:18.400
Like it's scary that that's
not in our control and

428
00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:21.850
it's in everybody's best interest
to help support that stuff

429
00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:23.910
and make it better. You
know, I don't know if

430
00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:27.060
this analogy works, but I'm
thinking about the relative levels

431
00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:30.090
of expertise that one might
have in an industry and

432
00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:32.970
the relative levels of layers
of abstraction that we sit

433
00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:36.120
on top of, I think
about the fact that my

434
00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:39.810
ability driving a car stops
at being able to change

435
00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:43.650
my own oil and maybe
my tires. Right. But my

436
00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:48.270
parents know how to take
cars apart. So they would

437
00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:53.130
totally be into driving an
opensource car. Wow. So then

438
00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:56.550
the question is, would I
be the right audience for

439
00:22:56.550 --> 00:22:59.400
an open source car? You
know what I'm saying? So

440
00:22:59.930 --> 00:23:01.320
I don't know if that's
a perfect analogy or not.

441
00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:03.810
There is no perfect analogy,
but how far down do

442
00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:05.250
you have to go? If
you're a plumber, then you

443
00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:07.650
get to use open source
plumbing tools, but should I

444
00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:11.520
be doing that to save
money? What is the, the

445
00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:13.470
motivator? I think a lot
of people are using open

446
00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:17.520
source and copy pasting from
stack overflow. Wouldn't you say?

447
00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:19.980
It's horrible to say this,
but because they're lazy Or

448
00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:21.750
they just don't know any
better. It's, it's sort of

449
00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:23.490
magical, right? I mean, I
can say this as a

450
00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:27.330
very junior developer, it's magical
when you like create your

451
00:23:27.330 --> 00:23:28.920
own app for the first
time and you see it

452
00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:30.540
online and you're like, wow,
I just did that in

453
00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:34.620
five minutes. That's awesome. And
I think you had this

454
00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:37.200
feeling of, well, as long
as it works enough and

455
00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:39.630
people can kind of see
it and you know, that's,

456
00:23:39.650 --> 00:23:43.620
that's good enough, right. I
mean, you can, you can

457
00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:47.840
raise money with no backend
and just a really shiny

458
00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:52.630
looking front And add a
text box that says, email

459
00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:55.330
me when you go live.
Like actually right. Yeah. And

460
00:23:55.330 --> 00:23:57.850
so it's sort of like,
people are just saying, all

461
00:23:57.850 --> 00:23:59.560
right, it's good enough. And
now I can go on

462
00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:02.440
with my idea and not
really thinking about like all

463
00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:05.790
the stuff underneath and I
think it's yeah, totally. Yeah.

464
00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:07.960
I mean, hopefully it is
the best example of this.

465
00:24:09.610 --> 00:24:13.420
And I think, I think
it's unrealistic to expect that

466
00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:17.140
everyone is just going to
like, learn how to use

467
00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:19.570
your analogy. Like, you know,
how to change their oil

468
00:24:19.570 --> 00:24:22.660
or go under the hood
of a car. And it's

469
00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:24.910
some people sort of like
harken back to the good

470
00:24:24.910 --> 00:24:27.310
old days when developers understood
all these things. And like,

471
00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:29.020
wouldn't it be nice if
people understood all this stuff

472
00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:32.410
and like, they're just not
going to, but I would

473
00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:34.330
like to take the approach
of at least like mitigating

474
00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:36.460
some of that risk by
saying, all right, they might

475
00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:38.470
not do it. And yeah,
maybe it's because they're lazy.

476
00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:41.980
It's because they're inexperienced or
don't understand whatever the case,

477
00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:45.610
but we should, at least
probably that makes a pretty

478
00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:48.100
good case for us, making
sure that infrastructure is well

479
00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:50.650
supported and that the people
who are maintaining things have

480
00:24:50.650 --> 00:24:54.490
the resources they need Just
in case anyone's confused. Or

481
00:24:54.490 --> 00:24:57.850
if you're confused, I'm not
implying laziness on the, beyond

482
00:24:57.850 --> 00:25:00.520
the part of people who
are getting started, you know,

483
00:25:00.790 --> 00:25:04.370
I am a lazy programmer
and I'm also a, a

484
00:25:04.450 --> 00:25:06.250
lazy person who would very
much like to get in

485
00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:08.920
a car and drive somewhere
without having to learn how

486
00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:11.530
to be a mechanic. So
it's okay to be lazy.

487
00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:13.480
It's not meant to denigrate
anybody. Yeah. I think it's

488
00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:15.130
a good, it's a good
mindset to start from is

489
00:25:15.130 --> 00:25:17.540
like, just assume people are
lazy and it's not wrong.

490
00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:20.860
We're all just human. Right.
And so given that laziness.

491
00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:26.500
Yeah, exactly. Absolutely. So, okay.
So what are you doing

492
00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:29.620
to, to change this? You
are researching this and you're

493
00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:32.350
working for the POC being
supported by the Ford foundation.

494
00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:36.010
Sorry. Yeah, I kind of
started out, so I just

495
00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:39.220
sort of explored it for
fun without really much of

496
00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:42.700
a plan in the fall.
I just kind of had

497
00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:45.580
the time and the space
and the funding to talk

498
00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:47.080
to a lot of different
people and kind of like

499
00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:49.540
understand all these different perspectives.
And I just started writing

500
00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:53.290
about it in January to
see, you know, just to

501
00:25:53.290 --> 00:25:55.600
like let people know what
I was up to and

502
00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:58.480
see whether anybody else cared.
Cause I wasn't sure if

503
00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:01.660
anyone else cared and got
a really good response to

504
00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:04.420
it and realized that there's
just sort of, there's a

505
00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:06.850
great opportunity for, I think
a lot of people don't

506
00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:10.060
know what's going on in
the open source world. They

507
00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:12.580
don't, they they're hearing the
word open source a lot,

508
00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:16.660
but they don't actually know
what it means. And everyone's

509
00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:19.180
sorta like nodding and smiling,
but they don't actually understand

510
00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:21.820
anything that's going on and
they want to understand. So

511
00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:23.260
it was a great opportunity,
I think, just to sort

512
00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:27.610
of like bring together different
parts of different tech communities

513
00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:30.550
that maybe haven't been talking
to each other before to

514
00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:32.740
say like, Hey, what are
the risks involved and how

515
00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:34.990
do we address them and
how do we help support

516
00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:37.360
people who are doing all
this really great work that

517
00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:40.630
we all rely upon? So
yeah, the past couple months

518
00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:44.370
I've been sorta like raising
awareness around and I'm trying

519
00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:47.370
to get all the right
people in the room. And

520
00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:50.820
from that we've been sort
of developing what are some

521
00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:53.970
specific types of things we
could be doing? Cause obviously

522
00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:56.550
like some people have called
this like a funding problem.

523
00:26:56.550 --> 00:26:58.260
I don't think it's as
simple as funding. It's a

524
00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:00.750
lot, if you can't just
like hand people money and

525
00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:03.300
then, you know, they spend
the money and then where's

526
00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:06.600
the, where's the sustainable model
in that. Right. And so

527
00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:08.460
it becomes as much more
complicated question of like, how

528
00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:11.880
do you support things without
funding them directly? Or when,

529
00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:14.400
when is it appropriate to
fund things directly and how

530
00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:17.880
can you help each of
those projects find sustainability? And

531
00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:21.270
those are kind of like
any like nonprofit problem or

532
00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:24.720
any like philanthropy problems, struggles
with that. Right. Where it's

533
00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:27.090
like, ideally you're not just
like giving a grant, but

534
00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:29.070
you're trying to figure out
how to help them help

535
00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:33.890
themselves. So Right. Throwing money
at this. Right. Right. And

536
00:27:33.890 --> 00:27:35.060
I think that's kind of
actually been part of the

537
00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:39.710
problem when people talk about
funding, open sources, people are

538
00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:41.810
trying to sort of like
say, well, can we just

539
00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:43.220
like raise a whole bunch
of money and donate it

540
00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:46.640
to the projects, but some
projects don't need money. Right?

541
00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:50.450
Like every project is really,
really different. So you can't

542
00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:52.580
just like automate that. It
is really just all about

543
00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:56.120
people and some projects, even
if they had money, maybe

544
00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:57.680
it's not enough money or
they wouldn't know what to

545
00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:59.570
do with the money. So
I think the problem goes

546
00:27:59.570 --> 00:28:03.140
much deeper than that. So
we've been talking through like,

547
00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:08.150
what are some specific programs
and initiatives that we could

548
00:28:08.150 --> 00:28:13.730
at least try to see
how we can positively support

549
00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:16.010
open source. And so I've
been talking to a bunch

550
00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:21.590
of different people about that
and hopefully developing something that

551
00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:24.560
can kind of start to
move forward with beyond the

552
00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:28.070
research and the writing phase.
But yeah, There's a great

553
00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:31.010
quote from Yehuda Katz who
says, as a tech community,

554
00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:34.580
we should treat documentation and
marketing and logistics and infrastructure

555
00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:38.420
as with as much respect
as we do engineering. Absolutely.

556
00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:40.250
And I think they're in
kind of lies part of

557
00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:43.760
the problem because opensource naturally
draws people who love to

558
00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:47.150
code. Right. And so you
have a lot of developer

559
00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:51.950
talent, but I don't think
anything can fully sustain itself

560
00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:55.910
on pure code. Like no
organization or sector or industry

561
00:28:55.910 --> 00:28:59.810
can purely run on engineers.
Even if it's just a

562
00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:02.030
little bit, you need somebody
who is thinking sort of

563
00:29:02.030 --> 00:29:07.550
about like sustainability or fundraising
or community or whatever it

564
00:29:07.550 --> 00:29:10.450
is. And so what I've
been thinking about is of

565
00:29:10.450 --> 00:29:12.260
like, what are all those
other pieces that we need

566
00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:15.800
to fill in to help
take the load off of

567
00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:19.040
maintainers or just make it
easier for them to advocate

568
00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:22.430
for themselves and, you know,
find sponsors or whatever it

569
00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:26.840
is. I think like, like
one areas that a lot

570
00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:29.420
of maintainers would love to
be sponsored by companies, but

571
00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:34.040
companies aren't aware of which
projects need help and they

572
00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:35.540
don't really know how to
talk to each other. So

573
00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:39.980
like a maintainer might be
like, they might say, Hey

574
00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:42.520
company, like, why don't you,
you know, pay me X

575
00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:44.080
amount of money. And the
company is sort of like,

576
00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:47.740
is this an invoice? Is
this a marketing thing? Is

577
00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:51.040
this a donation? Like, we
don't really understand how to

578
00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:53.440
give to you. And so
it's like, and one thing

579
00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:55.120
I thought about is, you
know, how can you develop

580
00:29:55.150 --> 00:29:59.230
better contracts and support documents
to just make that automated

581
00:29:59.230 --> 00:30:03.670
and easy? And you see
some parallels in the startup

582
00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:09.220
venture role too. So for
example, this form of investing

583
00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:14.680
called using convertible notes became
popular in recent years among

584
00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:17.900
startups where it's just sorta
like, it's just a much

585
00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:21.100
like faster way to get,
to get investment and get

586
00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:25.030
money. And as convertible notes
became a popular way of

587
00:30:25.030 --> 00:30:32.110
investing Y Combinator, which is
a startup accelerator develop these

588
00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:36.130
documents called the safe documents
and they use those as

589
00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:40.120
sort of like a standard
agreement for, to make startups

590
00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:44.720
feel safe and investors feel
safe that they're using this

591
00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:48.820
like standard approved document to
negotiate an investment into a

592
00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:51.490
company. Right. And so basically
it was just sort of

593
00:30:51.490 --> 00:30:54.340
like, there's a whole bunch
of like legal confusion about,

594
00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:55.810
you know, how do you
structure a convertible note and

595
00:30:55.810 --> 00:30:57.850
whatever. And so Y Combinator
kind of stepped in and

596
00:30:57.850 --> 00:31:01.030
said, Hey, here's a document
that everybody can use that

597
00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:03.100
we developed. And, you know,
with a bunch of companies

598
00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:05.470
and investors and got a
lot of input on and

599
00:31:05.470 --> 00:31:09.130
everyone feels safe using that.
Right. So, yeah. Could you

600
00:31:09.130 --> 00:31:12.040
develop something like that for
companies and maintainers that talk

601
00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:13.870
to each other and just
make it easier on them?

602
00:31:15.390 --> 00:31:18.030
And you put together a
website called funding O S

603
00:31:18.030 --> 00:31:22.170
s.com. That's kind of a
database of who's being funded.

604
00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:25.290
Who's not, Yeah. I actually
have to give credit to

605
00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:28.260
Jake Bauer for that. I
actually just started as a

606
00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:30.990
spreadsheet because I had already
been collecting a bunch of

607
00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:32.670
projects on my own. And
I was like, I'm sure

608
00:31:32.670 --> 00:31:35.910
I'm missing a lot because
I just sort of discovered

609
00:31:35.910 --> 00:31:40.980
all those projects by talking
to people one-on-one and yeah,

610
00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:44.640
I put out like this
spreadsheet and then spreadsheets started

611
00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:47.190
getting kind of out of
hand, which I guess is

612
00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:49.530
a good problem to have.
And I woke up one

613
00:31:49.530 --> 00:31:52.680
morning and Jay had created
this website and was like,

614
00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:54.990
here you go, just made
a simple web apps to

615
00:31:54.990 --> 00:31:59.880
help just help you manage
submissions, which was awesome. Magic

616
00:32:00.030 --> 00:32:05.490
opensource. So, yeah. And it's,
yeah, it's sorta just a,

617
00:32:05.610 --> 00:32:08.130
I mean, it's really just
meant to be a place

618
00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:11.940
to share projects and needs
and I've actually been using

619
00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:14.310
it to reference. And I
talked to the people who

620
00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:15.990
say, you know, do you
know a project that fits

621
00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:18.270
X, Y, Z bill or
whatever, I've gone through that

622
00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:21.030
list and found stuff. So
yeah, if you have a

623
00:32:21.030 --> 00:32:26.550
project that needs support, whether
it's money or just like

624
00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:29.880
maintainers or contributions or whatever,
it's a great place to

625
00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:32.310
put it. Yeah. We're starting
to see lots of places

626
00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:35.070
like that. So you've got
funding, oss.com. People should check

627
00:32:35.070 --> 00:32:39.000
out. There's also up for
grabs.net, which is a up

628
00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:41.000
for grabs with hyphens in
between. That's got a couple

629
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.490
of hundred of websites and
these are places looking for

630
00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:47.360
pull requests and documentation. And
also a reminder to folks

631
00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:49.550
that, again, it's not just
for engineers, you know, you

632
00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:53.450
could be doing documentation, be
doing tests, take a look

633
00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:56.330
at first timer is only
a, we're trying to put

634
00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:58.910
together a list of open
source projects that are friendly

635
00:32:58.910 --> 00:33:01.460
to people who are doing
open source for the first
