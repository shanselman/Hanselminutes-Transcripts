rising about the agile mindset.
Hi, this is Scott Hanselman.

9
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:01.820
This is another episode of
Hansel minutes on the phone.

10
00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.270
I've got Linda rising, a
consultant, just a lot of

11
00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.850
work in the agile space.
And thanks for joining me

12
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.850
today. Thank you, Scott. It's
a pleasure to be here.

13
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.570
Oh, it's always a pleasure
to watch you present. I've

14
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.970
had the pleasure of actually
meeting you. I think on

15
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.580
more cotton, actually, all the
continents that were not the

16
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.160
U S continent. I've never
met you in North America,

17
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.470
but I've seen you around
the, around the world. You

18
00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.520
do a lot of presentations
that I think challenge people's

19
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.640
way of thinking. I do
a lot of presentations on

20
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.490
code and you do a
lot of presentations on psychology

21
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.010
and mindset. And I guess
I should apologize for that

22
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:45.230
because I'm not an expert
in psychology. My PhD is

23
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.980
in computer science and I
think for most of my

24
00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.310
life, I would have to
say I'm than a technical

25
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.350
person. So the discovery that
there are other dimensions to

26
00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.090
software came late in life
for me. And I feel

27
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.290
like I'm playing the role
of Marley in the Christmas.

28
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.950
Carol, do you remember seeing
that at Christmas or reading

29
00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.870
that book by Charles Dickens?
A Christmas Carol? Yes, because

30
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:20.660
Marley is dead and his
ghost visit Scrooge and he

31
00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.890
says, Scrooge, Scrooge, I don't
want you to make the

32
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.030
same mistakes I did. I'm
trying to save you from

33
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.770
the fate. I have any
rattles, his chains and Scrooge

34
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:39.020
becomes very fearful. And so
I'm not dead yet, but

35
00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.740
I feel like that's my
role. I don't want other

36
00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.330
technical people to make the
same mistakes I did just

37
00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.840
to believe that it's all
technical, that if we just

38
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.500
had a better programming language
or a better environment, better

39
00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:00.190
tools that somehow all those
problems that have would go

40
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:06.930
away. I think that people
who are excited about building

41
00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.600
and excited about software, I
think that all those problems

42
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.500
can be solved by their,
by their tools. And I'll

43
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.450
see people put agile into
a system and it ends

44
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.140
up being a what I
like to call Scrummerfall, they'll

45
00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.140
just take waterfall and just
patch scrum onto it. And

46
00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.870
it's just an excuse to
be sloppy, but they focus

47
00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.910
so much on the tools.
They forget that these are

48
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.860
humans that are building software.
And I think that agile

49
00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.760
has brought that to the
table. And perhaps it's a

50
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.990
combination, at least for me,
personally, of asshole and of

51
00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:47.670
course patterns. And it's, I'm
a patterns junkie that that

52
00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.850
really changed my way of
thinking. And it made it

53
00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.800
possible for me to leave
behind that very strict, very

54
00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.850
technical bias, and to look
around me for the first

55
00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:04.860
time and to see that
indeed, these are people, indeed,

56
00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.210
we have trouble with communicating.
Indeed. We don't always understand

57
00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:11.850
each other as well as
we should. When we try

58
00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:16.920
to talk about even technical
topics. And there's an enormous

59
00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:21.840
amount of research in the
areas of cognitive neuroscience and

60
00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:27.180
psychology that speaks directly to
what we are doing, we

61
00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:32.040
should pay attention. Should I
do, or a listener do

62
00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.600
as a developer to, to
avoid reading all of these

63
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.540
books on psychology, but at
the same time, be not

64
00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.050
so ignorant on these things,
you know, do I just

65
00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.110
be aware that there are
different ways of thinking about

66
00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.480
this or do I just
watch a Linda rising presentation?

67
00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.680
I think that awareness is
the first step. And I

68
00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.760
know that for me, that
was the beginning that just

69
00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.810
being aware that there are
other things besides all of

70
00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.500
the technical issues on the
table, and now it's not

71
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.130
just me, but there are
others who are trying, and

72
00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.370
it's not an easy path
trying to keep up with

73
00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.720
all the advances in neuroscience
and to do a pretty

74
00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:21.330
good job of translating what
those neuroscientists are learning about

75
00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:26.190
our brains. And to tell
everybody in the software arena,

76
00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.610
here are some very useful
things that will help us

77
00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.060
do our jobs better. So
it's not just me, but

78
00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:38.100
there are many of us
messenger translators who are trying

79
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.610
to do a good job
of keeping up who subscribes

80
00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:45.150
all the podcasts and read
all the journals and try

81
00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.440
to skim the books, looking
for little nuggets. And that

82
00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:53.190
if people are just aware
that those possibilities are out

83
00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:55.320
there and to do what
they can to pay attention,

84
00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:59.840
there's so much that is
impossible to keep up with

85
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.310
it. Well, certainly it's possible
if you're also trying to

86
00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:05.860
keep up on the latest
tool and the latest widget,

87
00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:11.020
it's pretty overwhelming. That is
the problem that we all

88
00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.080
face. I have a little
training class that I give

89
00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:18.430
on thinking and influence strategies.
And I point out that

90
00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:23.440
the last person to know
everything was John Stewart mills, who

91
00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.100
died in the late 18
hundreds. And he was able

92
00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.520
to know everything because there
wasn't that much to know

93
00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:33.640
he could be a philosopher
and a scientist and a

94
00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:38.050
theologian and an economist, and
truly know all there was

95
00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:42.370
to know about all those
fields. Whereas now we can't

96
00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:46.720
know anything. The ability to
keep up in any small

97
00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:52.360
narrow field is impossible. So
therefore it's really impossible to

98
00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:57.460
look outside your field, to
bring in information from neuroscience

99
00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:01.120
or psychology or history. We
should be looking at history,

100
00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:07.420
art music. We just, we
can't do it. But at

101
00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:10.540
the same time, there is
a, there is the ability

102
00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:13.600
to grow and you bring
up in an email as

103
00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.990
we were planning this, talk
the work by Carol Dweck,

104
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:20.680
who has a book called
mindset about the new psychology

105
00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.560
of success. And the premise
of mindset is this idea

106
00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:27.250
that people either have a
sense that they can grow

107
00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:30.370
and that their talents can
be expanded, or they have

108
00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:33.340
a fixed mindset where they
basically they're born with that

109
00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:36.610
amount of talent. They get
their attributes when they're born

110
00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:39.820
and they cannot get any
more informed. They cannot become

111
00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:43.870
better than they were born.
And I think for me,

112
00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:47.860
the work of Carol Dweck
was an eye opener. And

113
00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:53.140
again, I felt that I
had to apologize for myself

114
00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:56.920
because I wasn't aware of
it. And I felt that

115
00:07:57.010 --> 00:08:00.640
I myself had a little
bit of a fixed mindset

116
00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:04.810
in certain areas. So when
I discovered that research, I

117
00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:08.980
thought perhaps it would be
as eye opening for other

118
00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:14.230
technical people to realize that
our fixed mindsets might be

119
00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.470
holding us back. So I'd
put together a little talk

120
00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:19.390
and I gave it for
the first time as a

121
00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:25.090
keynote at the end of
agile, 2011. And that talk

122
00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:27.880
should be still out there.
I think if people just

123
00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:35.170
Google on Lynda rising agile
mindset, agile 2011, there's something

124
00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:38.560
on YouTube or something on
the agile side. And so

125
00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:42.850
everybody could hear that talk.
And it was astounding to

126
00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:46.810
me, the reception that I
got because most people were

127
00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:51.400
as overwhelmed with that information
as I had been, and

128
00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:56.790
as surprised at their own
mindsets and as amazed at

129
00:08:56.790 --> 00:09:01.320
the effect that a particular
mindset might have on their

130
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:06.090
teams, on their families, on
the lives of their friends,

131
00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:10.980
on their children. I get
enormous amounts of emails still

132
00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:14.280
about that talk. And of
course I've given other variations

133
00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:18.180
on it since. So I
think it's probably one of

134
00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:21.930
the most important things I've
ever talked about or maybe

135
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:25.820
even thought about, Wow, I
will definitely add a link

136
00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:27.290
to that, to the show
notes. So people who are

137
00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:29.150
listening can just go to
the website and the link

138
00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:32.360
to the agile mindset talk
will be right there. One

139
00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:35.300
of the things that I
have personally thought about at

140
00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:38.510
a fixed mindset versus a
growth mindset is that there's

141
00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:42.710
kind of a working theory
that people who know that

142
00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:46.820
they are talented, have a
tendency to believe that that

143
00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:50.990
is an inborn thing and
other people can not achieve

144
00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:55.070
well. People who may have
come up in a less

145
00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:58.370
than ideal circumstances or people
who have kind of literally

146
00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:02.120
pulled themselves up through their
own bootstrap. Maybe they went

147
00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:04.820
to community college and became
a developer, as opposed to

148
00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:09.320
going to a, a privileged
school might believe that a

149
00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:13.580
growth mindset is simply how
the world works. Yeah. I

150
00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:15.770
think we all do that
to a certain extent. And

151
00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:19.490
I know I challenged myself
all the time when I

152
00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:22.730
sort of go down that
path to believe that there

153
00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:26.870
is ability or natural talent
that people just have, that

154
00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:30.710
they were born with it,
that they're a tiger woods

155
00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:34.970
or a Beethoven or an
Einstein. And certainly the research

156
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.110
that Carol Dweck has done
does not say that we

157
00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:44.210
can all reach incredible Heights
of accomplishment in any area.

158
00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:48.080
We choose what the research
shows is that no matter

159
00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:51.680
where we are today, we
can all get better. And

160
00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:57.140
just having that attitude, that
mindset toward whatever it is

161
00:10:57.170 --> 00:11:01.070
we're trying to do means
a lot of things about

162
00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:04.880
how we are as people.
It means that we look

163
00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:10.010
at ourselves as growing and
that we're looking at ourselves

164
00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:15.890
as learning, improving over time.
And a magic thing happens

165
00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:19.160
as soon as we look
at ourselves that way, we

166
00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:22.730
also begin to look at
other people that way. So

167
00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:27.980
we're less likely to stereotype
to judge, to work better

168
00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:31.820
with others on our team,
because we are constantly in

169
00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:37.220
the business, 24, seven other
evaluating everybody around us saying,

170
00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:41.000
well, you have it obviously,
or she does not have

171
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.780
it. And that gets in
the way of our team

172
00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:49.880
behavior, our communication, the kinds
of products we produce. There

173
00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:55.990
are classic examples of how
managers do this managers very

174
00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:59.890
quickly, even before they know
the performance abilities of people

175
00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:03.370
they hire have already made
up their minds about who's

176
00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:06.850
going to be a stellar
performer and who is not.

177
00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:12.400
And that attitude by managers
affects the behavior of those

178
00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:17.590
people. It becomes a self
fulfilling prophecy. So the power

179
00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:21.100
that managers and not all
managers, but that we all

180
00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:25.960
have over the performance of
other people is enormous. So

181
00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:30.190
this belief that we're all
growing, we're all learning. We

182
00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:34.120
can all get better. Maybe
we won't be Beethoven or

183
00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.730
Einstein, but then we can
be better tomorrow than we

184
00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:42.480
are. Today is enormously influential.
W when I was growing

185
00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:45.120
up, they used to call
these tapes, or at least

186
00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:47.070
maybe my mom used to
call them tapes. And she

187
00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:48.750
used to say, you have
these tapes running in your

188
00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:50.910
head. That's telling you whether
or not you're good at

189
00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:54.030
something or not. And you
have the choice to change

190
00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:57.120
those tapes. And as such
change, how you look at

191
00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:59.760
the world and how the
world will then treat you.

192
00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:04.140
I think that's probably a
good metaphor because we do

193
00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:07.350
have a little voice in
our head is the conscious

194
00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:10.500
mind that starts talking to
us as soon as we

195
00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:14.790
wake up. And it may
be a combination of things

196
00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:19.560
we heard from our own
parents or an influential teacher

197
00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:23.580
or someone we respected who
told us. So think about

198
00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:28.020
ourselves. And we play that
tape and we listened to

199
00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:31.380
that voice and we believe
that. And when we get

200
00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:35.460
discouraged and we're always going
to get discouraged, we reach

201
00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:38.790
some challenge and that tape
starts running and it says,

202
00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:44.280
see, you don't have it.
You not very good at

203
00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:49.500
whatever this thing is. You'll
probably never be very good.

204
00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:55.290
And immediately we begin to
believe that, and immediately it

205
00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:59.970
becomes true. So we need
to analyze those tapes and

206
00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:03.810
awareness helps. And we should
keep going back to that

207
00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:07.740
because the research is pretty
clear that just informing people,

208
00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:11.310
that there are the two
mindsets, the belief in growth,

209
00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:16.110
or the belief in fixed
talents, but just awareness can

210
00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:21.210
help us maybe make some
adjustments in that tape. Maybe

211
00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:27.630
listen to some other voices,
maybe steer our efforts in

212
00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:31.080
a better direction. And once
we can do that for

213
00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:34.530
ourselves, we can see that
in others or in our

214
00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:40.800
children, and we can help
them as well. You, you

215
00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:44.540
talk in your presentation on
the agile mindset and you,

216
00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:48.180
you referenced some examples where
they did actual experiments. And

217
00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:50.430
a lot of people think
that some people in particularly

218
00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:53.120
engineers think psychology is just
a bunch of nonsense. And,

219
00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:55.460
you know, we're all just
kind of talking ourselves in

220
00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:59.990
circles here, but this is
real science. There is, there

221
00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:04.280
is neuroscience behind this and
behaviors change when mindsets change.

222
00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:07.850
And you give this example
where they categorized people, students

223
00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:10.940
into different groups of people
saying that this is a

224
00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:14.030
really smart, inherently smart group
of people. And these are

225
00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:18.140
the kids that put effort
into their work. And how

226
00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:21.860
did their behavior changed when
the mindset and the, the

227
00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:26.530
context for the tests was,
was changed There, there's not

228
00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:34.000
only a research around all
of this mindset, but the

229
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.900
research has been going on
for decades. One of the

230
00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:42.400
things that psychologists do is
not only experiment, but they

231
00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:48.010
repeat experiments. It has to
be something that researchers have

232
00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:52.150
uncovered and also shared with
others and then have those

233
00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:57.460
others repeat. So they validate
the results. I often get

234
00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:00.310
on a little bit of
a soap box about people

235
00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:04.210
who are in software development
saying that we are not

236
00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:09.100
scientific. Most of us who
have come to that agile

237
00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:14.230
process have done so simply
by hearing good stories, we've

238
00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:18.340
been overwhelmed by a good
story that someone else told

239
00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:22.420
us about a team that
had tremendous success, as soon

240
00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:26.950
as they became an adopter
of scrum or XP, but

241
00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:30.340
we never looked at hard
data. We never saw any

242
00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:37.690
kind of balanced, controlled, randomized,
scientific experiments in order to

243
00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:42.370
make a decision we're swayed
all the time by evidence

244
00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:47.140
that really wouldn't stand up
in any scientific arena. So

245
00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:50.860
when you look at everything
that's been done around mindset,

246
00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:55.210
the amount of research there
is overwhelming, it's been done

247
00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:58.360
with children. It's been done
with adults. It's been done

248
00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:02.680
with sports teams it's been
done in business. And what

249
00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:07.840
it shows is that with
a very, very small kind

250
00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:13.510
of a difference in mindset,
you get very different behaviors.

251
00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:18.550
People who have been encouraged
to adopt the fixed mindset,

252
00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:22.870
for instance, immediately change all
their goals so that they

253
00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:27.910
look good. They immediately look
at failure as a way

254
00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:31.660
of defining themselves. Instead of
taking it as a challenge,

255
00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:36.400
when anything goes wrong for
those children or people who

256
00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:40.030
are on the sports team,
and they look at failure,

257
00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:46.600
they immediately give up, they
become helpless and hopeless. Whereas

258
00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:50.310
in the experimental data, it's
pretty clear that those that

259
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:54.870
have been moved into an
agile mindset, suddenly embrace goals

260
00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:59.010
that are about learning. They
take on challenges. They get

261
00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:03.930
excited about hard things, where
they might not appear to

262
00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:07.260
be successful, but where they
might learn. And in the

263
00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:12.750
face of failure, they become
resilient. They become someone who,

264
00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:15.780
and this for me was
the connection with agile software

265
00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:21.390
development. They embrace failure. They
don't take it as a

266
00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:26.010
label or as a sign
that they don't have it.

267
00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:29.880
They say, this is an
opportunity for me to learn.

268
00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:35.490
The differences are so clear
and what's done to nudge

269
00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:40.200
those groups is usually just
a very small thing. As

270
00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:44.040
you said to simply say
to someone, Oh, you did

271
00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:49.020
really well here. You must
be very smart or to

272
00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:52.080
the other group. Oh, you
did really well here. You

273
00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:56.400
must have worked hard. And
that those two slightly different

274
00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:01.980
statements are enough to encourage
a different mindset, a different

275
00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:06.090
goal setting, a different way
of looking at failure. The

276
00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:10.530
results based on those little
tiny nudges are a stale

277
00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:15.440
name Yesterday. I was reading
to my five-year-old and my

278
00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:18.860
seven year old and a
seven year old has started

279
00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:20.870
reading just in the last,
I don't know, a couple

280
00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:23.120
of months his, we say
that he's gotten, he's got

281
00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:25.310
his super power. Basically he
woke up one day and

282
00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:26.570
he could, he could read.
And it was one of

283
00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:28.700
those things that happens when
kids are growing up. They,

284
00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:31.880
they, they click and reading
clicked a little while ago

285
00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:34.190
for him. The five year
old on the other hand

286
00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:39.170
is exactly two years younger,
almost to the day. And

287
00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:41.570
they were reading and the
seven year olds having a

288
00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:45.740
blast and the five-year-olds really
struggling. And I encourage the

289
00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:48.890
five-year-old to read a word
and he struggled with it.

290
00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:52.730
And the seven year old
without being malicious said, Oh,

291
00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:55.700
that's okay. He's not very
smart at this. And I

292
00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:58.850
just saw the five year
old, just kind of wince,

293
00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:02.000
and then almost fall over
with, you could see him

294
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.850
kind of wilting. And it
wasn't, it wasn't malicious. It

295
00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:08.240
was just two little boys
that I think, think that

296
00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:10.550
they are twins. You know,
they, they think of each

297
00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:13.670
other as peers and the
seven year old truly doesn't

298
00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:17.750
understand that the five-year-old is
two full years behind them,

299
00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:22.280
which is effectively a third
of his entire life. And

300
00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:24.110
I just, I worry about
that. I don't want, not

301
00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:26.960
in my mind as parent
I'm thinking, okay. And then

302
00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:29.960
it's going to be 30
and 32. And the 30

303
00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:31.700
year old is going to
think that he's not, I'm

304
00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:35.090
no good. I'm not smart
enough. How do we prevent

305
00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:39.800
these little, these little missteps
from kind of setting the

306
00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:43.310
direction for the entire life?
Well, one of the things

307
00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:46.430
you can do is make
the analogy with strength that

308
00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:52.000
probably older one is also
stronger can lift or move

309
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.290
things. And that you should
point out that while you

310
00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:59.230
can move this heavy object,
or you can pick up

311
00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:03.280
this heavy object. Yes, you're
stronger than your brother because

312
00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:07.330
you're older. He's, he's still
growing he's problem with the

313
00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:11.860
older one is also probably
taller. And, and to say,

314
00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:15.940
well, you're taller than your
brother because you're older and

315
00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:20.020
he's still growing. He'll become
taller. He'll become stronger. He'll

316
00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:23.620
become better. He'll become. And
that the idea that all

317
00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:27.130
of those abilities are exactly
the same. So the ability

318
00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:30.730
to read the ability to
solve problems, to understand, to

319
00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:35.290
speak language, all of those
mental things are exactly like

320
00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:38.920
all those physical things that
most of the time, even

321
00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:42.580
children can understand the difference
between somebody who is older,

322
00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:46.330
who was taller, who is
stronger. And if they understand

323
00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:48.940
that all of those things
that have to do with

324
00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:53.230
thinking or learning or reading
or speaking are exactly the

325
00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:58.450
same, because they are that
helps them understand that it's

326
00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:02.800
not, that the other person
is dumber or stupid, or

327
00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:08.410
they're just younger and they're
still growing. And that they,

328
00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:11.590
when they compare themselves to
someone who's older than they

329
00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:15.760
are, should also not be
discouraged. That while they're still

330
00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:19.990
growing, they're getting better. They're
getting taller, they're getting stronger,

331
00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:24.910
they're learning more. And that,
that's the lesson that we

332
00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:29.200
want as parents and grandparents
to tell our children or

333
00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:36.490
grandchildren is that, that continues
beyond childhood. When you're out

334
00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:42.400
of school, when you're older,
that you never lose that

335
00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:47.380
Habitude of growing and learning.
And that the research is

336
00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:54.070
clear, your brain continues to
develop new pathways, new capabilities

337
00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:58.530
until you die. So it
would be a totally reasonable

338
00:22:58.530 --> 00:23:00.840
thing for me to, in
the face of failure to

339
00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:08.340
tell my boss, I'm still
growing. Of course, as long

340
00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:11.730
as your boss supported that
attitude. And you know, the

341
00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:16.590
research is also clear on
organizations that there are organizations

342
00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:21.390
that have a fixed mindset.
So what would happen to

343
00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:26.010
growth people in a situation
like that? They hire for

344
00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:30.390
talent. And there's a continual
pressure on the people in

345
00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:35.670
the organization to show that
they have it. Steve jobs

346
00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:38.520
is famous for talking to
the people who were on

347
00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:42.180
the Apple Lisa team. And
he said, you guys don't

348
00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:47.360
have it. Your B players,
we don't have beat players

349
00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:51.110
around here. We only have
a players. I think maybe

350
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:55.040
you guys need to find
jobs elsewhere. He was brutal.

351
00:23:56.900 --> 00:24:00.470
He did a very good
job of labeling people and

352
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:05.810
calling them less than stellar,
if anything went wrong. And

353
00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:08.210
of course we know many
times the success of your

354
00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:11.660
project doesn't necessarily depend on
the ability of the people

355
00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:15.770
in it. It's probably much
more complicated than that, but

356
00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:19.220
he was a very good
example of somebody who had

357
00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:23.960
a fixed mindset and who
ran an organization that had

358
00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:29.900
a fixed. So the organization
itself has that mindset. And

359
00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:33.650
if it does, it encourages
behavior and the people who

360
00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:37.310
are in it as exactly
like the behavior of people

361
00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:40.070
who have a fixed mindset,
they want to look good

362
00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:44.570
in order to do that.
They might cheat. They might

363
00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:49.190
sabotage the work of others.
They'll do a lot of

364
00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:53.720
underhanded things so that they
will look better and they'll

365
00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:58.430
get the promotion or the
recognition or someone will call

366
00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:02.330
them an a player. So
there's a lot of labeling,

367
00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:07.880
a lot of negative behavior
that results in organizations, where

368
00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:11.510
the people in it and
the organization itself, if you

369
00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:14.990
can think of an organization,
all mine are very fixed

370
00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:19.190
and so different from organizations
that have an agile mindset

371
00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:23.030
where it's about learning. It's
about growing that mistakes are,

372
00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:26.120
when you learn something important,
then you should take advantage

373
00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:31.520
of that. My example is
Southwest airlines. They hire people

374
00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:36.290
for attitude. Can you learn,
are you excited about learning?

375
00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:38.990
Are you willing to try
new things? Do you do

376
00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:42.230
out of the box thinking
then they encourage that. And

377
00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:45.410
the people who work there,
I've never worked at Southwest,

378
00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:48.440
but the people I know
who do say it's exactly

379
00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:53.360
like that, it's a challenging
organization where everybody is encouraged

380
00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:56.510
to keep on growing, to
keep on learning. And that's

381
00:25:56.510 --> 00:26:03.280
where we all want to
be. That's really, that's really

382
00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:07.630
powerful. I mean, I think
it's a constant struggle as

383
00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:11.500
we have those tapes saying
I can't, and I won't,

384
00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:12.970
or I won't be able
to. And then if that

385
00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:17.530
gets supported by an organization,
like one of the things

386
00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:20.140
that we struggle with sometimes
at the, at Microsoft, where

387
00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:22.930
I work is they have
this, this program called the

388
00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:25.540
stack ranking. And I've seen
this at Intel and other

389
00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:29.590
large companies where we had
a line, everybody up by

390
00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:34.060
height, effectively, we're high visibility.
And if you get a

391
00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:38.520
label where you are, you
know, under achieved, and then

392
00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:42.850
that's it at well at
other organizations, they may give

393
00:26:42.850 --> 00:26:45.540
you moment in time. They
may measure a moment in

394
00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:48.450
time and say, well, you
know, you were a three,

395
00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:53.700
this, this period. They also
will simultaneously have a potential

396
00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:57.210
number and indicate when, when
ranking you and trying to

397
00:26:57.210 --> 00:26:58.770
give you your bonus at
the end of the year,

398
00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:02.010
that, you know, but you're
showing great potential or your

399
00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:05.400
effort as recognized, or, you
know, most improved and things

400
00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:08.580
like that. What do you
think when it comes time

401
00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:11.190
to, to find out if
the team, as it was

402
00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:15.060
an effective team and someone
is not performing well, how

403
00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:19.610
do you rank that? Well,
you know, not, not everybody

404
00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:23.150
is working up to their
full potential all the time,

405
00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:26.390
and there can be many
reasons for that. And if

406
00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:28.790
it's going to be an
effective organization, it has to

407
00:27:28.790 --> 00:27:33.020
provide opportunities for everyone up
to a certain point. And

408
00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:35.870
I think sometimes it's that
people are not happy in

409
00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:38.720
what they're doing. And if
people are not happy, then

410
00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:42.290
they should try something else.
But it shouldn't be about

411
00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:48.410
your capabilities period. It's that,
for some reason, you're, you're

412
00:27:48.410 --> 00:27:50.900
not happy here and you're
not doing as well as,

413
00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:53.900
as whatever the standard is
that we need for this

414
00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:58.010
organization. And maybe we can
find another place for you,

415
00:27:58.490 --> 00:28:03.110
but that shouldn't happen. That
severing a PI's without some

416
00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:06.680
effort on the part of
the organization, in my belief

417
00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:11.540
to see what can be
done, perhaps it's the result

418
00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:16.580
of many sorts of things,
you know, not, I don't

419
00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:20.570
think this is a clear
cut thing, but what the

420
00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:23.330
research shows pretty clearly is
that there are a lot

421
00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:27.350
of people who are labeled
early in their lives, who

422
00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:31.760
don't do well. The, all
the research now that Carol

423
00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:35.900
Dweck and her graduate students
are doing is around minority

424
00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:41.000
students and women. Why aren't
there more women in it?

425
00:28:42.050 --> 00:28:45.110
And what it shows pretty
clearly is that at some

426
00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:49.160
point they have taken on
this fixed mindset that, well,

427
00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:52.820
I can't do it. That
girls believe at a pretty

428
00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:56.240
young age that they can't
do math or science. It's

429
00:28:56.240 --> 00:29:00.830
also true for Hispanics and
blacks, that when they learn

430
00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:03.020
that the mind is a
muscle and when they're moved

431
00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:06.440
towards the agile mindset, they
all do better. But up

432
00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:11.030
until that point, they're so
way down by things they've

433
00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:14.810
been told all their lives
that they don't perform well,

434
00:29:15.530 --> 00:29:18.050
they don't do well in
math or science. And in

435
00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:23.450
fact, Hispanics and blacks typically
underperform across the board. And

436
00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:27.620
all of the experiments that
WEX research has shown is

437
00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:32.810
that just with some small
interventions, they all began to

438
00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:37.160
make enormous improvements. What are
we doing? What are we

439
00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:40.340
doing to little children? What
are we doing to people?

440
00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:45.310
And by this early labeling,
by throwing them into this

441
00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:52.510
fixed mindset, we're losing enormous
amounts of contributions, innovation ideas,

442
00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:58.120
because we believe they can't
do it. And therefore they

443
00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:03.660
believe they can't do it.
And they can. It's amazing

444
00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:06.870
how one sentence will, will
make that difference. I remember

445
00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:10.140
growing up in the seventies
that there was a, a

446
00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:13.380
Barbie doll that came out
with a string and you'd

447
00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:15.870
pull the string on her
back. And she would say

448
00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:22.770
math is hard. I think
I missed that. That's good

449
00:30:22.770 --> 00:30:26.040
though. And it was, it
was a, it was an

450
00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:29.250
outrage because that one sentence
who knows the damage that

451
00:30:29.250 --> 00:30:32.370
was done with that one
sentence. But I I've, I've

452
00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:36.420
heard in this, in these
research experiments when giving people

453
00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:40.350
a test just as you're
passing out the papers, if

454
00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:43.290
you say something like, you
know, women tend to do

455
00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:48.930
better on this test, they
will do better. Or Even

456
00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:50.940
if it's not true, they
just simply by saying that

457
00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:52.710
it sets the mindset, it
sets the tone for the

458
00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:57.240
entire test. Yes, there is.
There's also a variation that's

459
00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:01.110
been done on that at
the top. When the participant

460
00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:05.700
fills in information, name, address,
social security number. If there's

461
00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:08.190
a little box where they
have to check male or

462
00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:12.540
female on some versions of
the test, they check email

463
00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:15.750
on other versions. They don't
check email, but otherwise the

464
00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:19.470
test is exactly the same.
And in a balance controlled

465
00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:24.720
experiments, just checking that little
box can cause a significant

466
00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:30.510
decrease in the score. Even
when afterwards the participants are

467
00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:33.870
asked, did you notice there
was a little box where

468
00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:37.530
you had to check female
and most don't even remember

469
00:31:37.530 --> 00:31:42.180
it, but clearly it had
a powerful effect on how

470
00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:45.810
they did on that exam.
It started the little tape

471
00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:50.100
that said, Oh, yes, I
guess I am female. Oh

472
00:31:50.610 --> 00:31:54.810
yes. Everybody knows that females
don't do as well. We

473
00:31:54.810 --> 00:32:01.980
all know that buy into
our own stereotypes. So even

474
00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:08.130
women believe themselves that they're
not as good and therefore

475
00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:12.330
they're not. And we have
to build up that resiliency.

476
00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:16.680
So as those little tapes
are running, both cultural contextual

477
00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:20.640
team, organizational are running. As
we bump into those messages,

478
00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:24.690
we have to be resilient
against them. Yes. And we

479
00:32:24.690 --> 00:32:26.790
have to have our own
messages. We have to have

480
00:32:26.790 --> 00:32:29.160
our own messages about failure
is good. You have to

481
00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:31.920
have our own messages about
learning is good. This is

482
00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:34.740
an opportunity for me to
learn. And we have some

483
00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:39.500
mentor others instead of telling
people, Oh, you're, you're great.

484
00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:42.650
You're wonderful. Or saying that
to our children to say,

485
00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:45.500
Oh, you really worked hard.
I like the way you

486
00:32:45.890 --> 00:32:49.580
and praise what was done.
Praise the strategy, point out

487
00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:54.320
the process instead of labeling,
instead of putting people in

488
00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:59.180
boxes, instead of encouraging that
fixed mindset, we need to

489
00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:02.600
do a better job, just
not only for our own

490
00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:06.350
families, but for our own
little tapes and for the

491
00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:09.880
tapes of other people that
we care about. Some people

492
00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:12.940
have said that that's an
America kind of a uniquely

493
00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:15.880
American problem, that there was
a time in the eighties

494
00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:18.400
and nineties where every child
was told that they were

495
00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:23.680
special and not everyone can
be quote unquote special. So

496
00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:25.870
if you tell every child
that they are a unique

497
00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:29.320
snowflake, you end up with
a lot of children that

498
00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:30.820
grow up in the 20
year olds who believe that

499
00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:33.460
they are a unique snowflake
and they come out of

500
00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:35.980
college saying where's my a
hundred thousand dollars a year

501
00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:41.890
job Indeed. Awesome. Although I,
I have given this talk

502
00:33:41.890 --> 00:33:46.420
in China and I asked
along the way of the

503
00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:50.890
participants, do you know what
I'm talking about? And of

504
00:33:50.890 --> 00:33:55.630
course in China, mows one
child policy has been in

505
00:33:55.630 --> 00:33:59.560
effect now for over 30
years. And when you walk

506
00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:04.080
around in Tiananmen square on
a Sunday, and you see

507
00:34:04.090 --> 00:34:07.210
the little children there who
are all dressed up in

508
00:34:07.210 --> 00:34:11.290
their costumes, even little girls,
now I'm happy to say.

509
00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:16.690
And the expression in Chinese
is every child has six

510
00:34:16.690 --> 00:34:20.560
parents. So there are the
parents who only have one

511
00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:24.070
child, of course. And they
are the product of a

512
00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:27.220
family where there was only
one child. So here are

513
00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:31.390
the two sets of grandparents.
So here are six adults

514
00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:36.280
hovering around this one child.
Who's given all the attention,

515
00:34:36.370 --> 00:34:41.140
all the focus, all the
expectation of the whole family.

516
00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:44.260
And they're told from the
very beginning, Oh, you're the

517
00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:47.260
best. You're the smartest. You
have to work hard. The

518
00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:51.880
family depends upon you. Enormous
pressure on these little tiny

519
00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:56.650
children from the get go.
So what's coming out are,

520
00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:59.050
I don't know how to
say it in Chinese, but

521
00:34:59.050 --> 00:35:04.870
they're called little emperors or
little impresses who are just

522
00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:10.330
as fixed, just as entitled
as any of the American

523
00:35:10.330 --> 00:35:13.780
children who had been told
the same from the time

524
00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:16.600
they were born, you are
special. You get the blue

525
00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:19.930
brim and you're number one,
you should get straight A's.

526
00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:23.680
And in many classes, that's
the case. Now parents put

527
00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:27.940
pressure on teachers. My child
deserves an a can't you

528
00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:31.750
see that my child is
the best. I even heard

529
00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:35.290
from a manager just recently
who got a call from

530
00:35:35.290 --> 00:35:38.580
the mother of one of
his new hires who wanted

531
00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:42.300
to know why he wasn't
being promoted? Why wasn't he

532
00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:45.750
getting bonuses? Why wasn't he
on the fast track? Didn't

533
00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:54.530
this manager know how brilliant
her son was. Wow. Yeah.

534
00:35:54.650 --> 00:35:57.800
I really, really hope that
that never happens to me

535
00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:04.910
Indeed. Well, thank you so
much, Linda, rising for chatting

536
00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:07.940
with me in a day.
It's been my pleasure, Scott.

537
00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:11.600
Thank you for inviting me.
This has been another episode

538
00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:13.760
of Hanselminutes and we'll see
you again next week.
