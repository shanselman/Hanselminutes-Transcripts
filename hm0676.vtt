G U n.com. Hi, this

11
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.830
is Scott Hanselman. This is
another episode today. I'm talking

12
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.650
with Sean Valentine from the hidden
genius project. How are you,

13
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.280
sir? I'm doing well. Hi
Scott. How are you? Pretty

14
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.670
good. I'm just raising these
children, raising these boys, trying

15
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.760
to get them to get
their heads. Yeah, I always

16
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.190
tell you is as soon
as you're done send me

17
00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.530
the book so that I
can use that playbook to

18
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.790
increase my chances of success
as well. I'm telling you,

19
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.140
these children are driving me
nuts. They're in that tween

20
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.570
place where one's 11 and
one is 13 and they

21
00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.520
both have it all figured
out and they don't even,

22
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.700
they don't even need me.
Right? Like as if you

23
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.300
know, they're the first people
who were 12 and 13

24
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.250
years old. That's exactly. That's
perfect. That is it. It

25
00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.550
is the first time that
a 13 year old and

26
00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.790
an 11 year old have
ever existed and they came

27
00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.040
fully formed, ready to go.
He wants to get his

28
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.010
own apartment and just drive
away right now. I had

29
00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.310
a young man at 17.
Tell me recently that he's

30
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.380
living the bed. This is
the best time of his

31
00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.220
life. Like this is it.
This is yeah. Like if

32
00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.950
he doesn't take advantage of
the moment right now, then

33
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.570
everything else is over. I
almost cried. I literally just

34
00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.680
like dropped a tear right
there. That's adorable. Adorable. Isn't

35
00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.830
it. So you're dealing with
children In respect to the

36
00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.690
children. I'm sure some of
them are older all the

37
00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.330
time. Tell me about the
hidden genius project. Well, the

38
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.600
hidden genius project, trains and
mentors, black male youth in

39
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.320
technology creation and entrepreneurship and
leadership skills to transform their

40
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.760
lives and communities we've been
around since 2012. We're an

41
00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.630
Oakland based organization with a
second site in Richmond, but

42
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.610
our demographic typically, or it's
about black male youth and

43
00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.660
the ages of high school
ages, rising freshmen to rising

44
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.990
juniors. So I see a
spectrum of 13 year olds

45
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.730
to 1819 year olds. And
again, they all, most, if

46
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:49.190
not all, believe that this
is, this is it. How

47
00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:50.660
many of them come with
it? I'll figure it out.

48
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.030
And they just tolerate you
versus how many people are

49
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.820
really excited about this and
getting involved in, in both

50
00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.890
STEM and also Technology. It's
funny, we just completed our

51
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.290
seventh, seventh annual interview day
and every year the students

52
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.090
become more and more engaged
and excited about STEM related

53
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.500
topics about the space in
general. So you, you have

54
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.680
a mixed bag of folks
with generally, you know, really

55
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.620
want to get in. They
probably built their own computers

56
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.860
or, or, or wanting to,
and then you definitely have

57
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.070
some folks who are dragged
in by their moms, pulling

58
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.090
on their ear lobes and
making, forcing their, their, their

59
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.700
hand, and then shout out
to those moms because they

60
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.990
definitely have the best intentions
for those young men. Yeah.

61
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:38.910
We're trying to find that
balance and raising our young

62
00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.330
men to figure out like
pushing hard enough that they

63
00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.840
know there's pressure to, to
achieve, but also finding that

64
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.230
internal, that internal pressure, that
internal thing that tells you

65
00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.610
that you need to wake
up and make it happen

66
00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.540
today. And we're fighting with
right now, it's it's social

67
00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.090
media, it's tech it's video
games. It's these, the various

68
00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.420
screens that I think will
be their bridge to achievement

69
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.080
is the screen that is
holding them back. Exactly. Exactly.

70
00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.970
I also believe that just,
just seeing where, where we

71
00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.180
are in terms of an
as a, as a, as

72
00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.660
a mentor at the hidden
genius project, we have this

73
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.930
unique view of get this
viewpoint of this from the

74
00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.890
students who they are, who
they want to be, who

75
00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.710
they, who do they think
they are and, and the

76
00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.540
relationship between them and their
parents, you spoke on things

77
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.200
such as, you know, video
games and social media. And

78
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.900
that, that, that screen is,
you know, stopping the thing

79
00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.690
that should propel them and
stopping them. But I think

80
00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.840
that one thing that's where
it should start is just

81
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:49.020
the engagement piece with parents,
whether it's healthy conversations, you

82
00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.320
know, or I find that
some parents are afraid of

83
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.650
technology and because it's not
a part of their generation,

84
00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.560
they just shun everything that
has to do with technology.

85
00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.480
And so I always want
to say that it's a

86
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.980
50, 50, you know, street
where we, we, as parents

87
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.480
may have to work towards
meeting this students or, or

88
00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.060
the teens halfway just to
kind of get a better

89
00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.190
understanding of where they are.
And so we can help

90
00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.310
them navigate those spaces. Like
we said earlier in the

91
00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.040
conversation, they believe that this
is the first time that

92
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.420
life has happened when they,
you know, became 12 and

93
00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:27.090
they believe that, you know,
there's no connection point between

94
00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.580
the adults and where they
are. It's like, you didn't

95
00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.070
have internet when you, when
you were a child. So

96
00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:35.880
you don't, you can't possibly
know anything, right? Like Google

97
00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.450
is really God. And, and
as long as you just

98
00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:42.480
met Google then, and you
don't have a relationship with

99
00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:46.050
Google and then, you know,
your word isn't anything. And

100
00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.040
so taking a, a step
toward those young, those young

101
00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.880
people can kind of, I
think it should be the

102
00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.470
best start for us as
parents and, and meeting those,

103
00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.370
those, those young people halfway
because they cause honestly they

104
00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:04.750
do not know any better.
I think the challenging part

105
00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.660
is that social media is
happening so fast that for

106
00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.550
us as adults to say
that we have it all

107
00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:11.350
figured out and that they
should listen to us is

108
00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:14.470
challenging, right? Like we do,
we know best. I think

109
00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:18.220
we know best. We definitely
have learned that fast. I,

110
00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:22.330
I, I'm confident in that
part. I, and that's again,

111
00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:25.450
you know, going back to
Fe showing up where this,

112
00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:28.510
where we're, where the kids
are and learning as much

113
00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:30.820
as possible, because then you
can kind of see through

114
00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:33.550
the information that they're receiving
and kind of help them

115
00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.360
vet out what's real information
and what's healthy to pick

116
00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.910
up and, you know, not
so healthy and that should

117
00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:43.270
be put down. And how
do they decide that, like,

118
00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:46.330
if it's, is this an
all things in moderation type

119
00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:48.340
of a situation like there's
so many times we tell

120
00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.610
kids no. And that that's
got a, it's got a

121
00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.260
great on them. It's got
to wear on them to

122
00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:57.340
be told no so often.
Totally. And then sometimes it

123
00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:00.220
I'd have to admit it
can be, you know, our

124
00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:04.510
inability to, you know, hold
some energy left at the

125
00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:07.510
end of the day and
give enough to fully explain,

126
00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:12.400
explain the know, you know,
students and youth are sponges

127
00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.070
and they're excited about learning
and they want to learn

128
00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:18.250
everything. And, and, and who
are we to set limitations

129
00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:24.700
on their ability to grasp
information? Right. Always, I always

130
00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:29.080
like to bring up this
experience for a young teacher.

131
00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:32.260
I believe it was Alabama
and no, it was new

132
00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.230
Orleans and she taught a
class and they told her

133
00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:37.720
that, you know, the class
was reading at this certain

134
00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:41.260
level and she mixed up
their reading level with it.

135
00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:47.860
I, I Q scores and,
and taught the students at

136
00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:51.160
like, you know, at a
high level, you know, maybe

137
00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.640
two or three levels above
what they were scheduled to

138
00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:58.450
know and that's scheduled, but,
you know, appropriated this appropriate

139
00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:01.990
learning level. And the teacher
ended up teaching them two

140
00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:04.780
or three levels above that
and have no idea that,

141
00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:07.510
you know, some of the
students were told that, you

142
00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:10.510
know, they had maybe a
disability here or a challenge

143
00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:13.840
there and ended up the
students were, you know, took

144
00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:16.870
onto that level and ran
with it. And so with

145
00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:19.930
that being said, like, you
know, sometimes we set limitations

146
00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:23.380
on, you know, how far
that our kids can go

147
00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.600
and we need to kind
of break out of those

148
00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:29.780
restrictions to, to, to not
challenge them, but to, to,

149
00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:32.680
to uplift them and bring
them up so that they

150
00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:35.710
are confident with asking us
questions to your point about

151
00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:39.130
the nose everyone gets tired
of. No. And so you

152
00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:41.470
do definitely want to always
encourage them to be able

153
00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:43.240
to come to you and
not just to hear to

154
00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:46.270
know, but to learn from
you and know that you're

155
00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:48.760
a resource. Well, and then
also that we're all just

156
00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:52.120
figuring this out as a
group, Right. Let's learn together.

157
00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:55.150
Right. And that is a
challenging part though, because there's,

158
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:58.440
there's the strategy of, I'm
trying to be your friend,

159
00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:02.460
which is usually my parenting
strategy. And then there's my

160
00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:05.730
wife who explicitly starts almost
every day with, I am

161
00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:10.160
not your friend. So We're,
you know what I mean?

162
00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.550
Like these you've probably experienced
both of these styles of

163
00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:15.560
parenting, you know what I
mean? Hey buddy, I'm your

164
00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:17.540
buddy, I'm your friend. Tell
me about, How's it going?

165
00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:23.510
It's only the para who
says, mom said, no, you

166
00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:25.370
know, if it was for
me, but it's not up

167
00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:27.650
to me, mom says, no,
it's going to be no.

168
00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:31.480
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I definitely
in moderation and, and, and

169
00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:36.320
setting the expectations. Right. So
it's not that, you know,

170
00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:40.280
there won't be negative outcomes.
It's, let's explore. Let's talk

171
00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:44.570
about why. And let's, let's
let the, let everyone walk

172
00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:47.420
away with an, a great,
a good rationale for the

173
00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:50.450
decision that we made. I
assume that they have logic,

174
00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:54.320
can they process And that
high level. And I think

175
00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:58.430
that at, with certain conversations,
it's just takes us to

176
00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:01.250
be more patient as parents
and, and, and a lot

177
00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:04.060
of the work life balance.
Again, for us, it could

178
00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.560
be a lot of different
things, but like, if we

179
00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:10.520
start with patients, they want
to understand, right. Some things

180
00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:14.180
will be beyond them, but
there is, there are analogies.

181
00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:18.050
There's a lot of Harry Potter
metaphors and things that we

182
00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:21.680
can come up with to
bring them up to speed.

183
00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:24.380
You know, I have this
joke where I asked my

184
00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:26.090
kids to listen a little
quicker, so I don't have

185
00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:28.310
to slow down and then
that they can catch up.

186
00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:33.530
But honestly, honestly, right. You
know, but again, finding that

187
00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:37.340
healthy space, there will always
be competing interests, right? Because

188
00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:40.280
as a parent, we, we,
we believe that we know

189
00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:43.130
what's best for the students
or our students or our

190
00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:47.750
children. And, and they believe
that there are other avenues

191
00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:51.380
and options that parents haven't
even, you know, grasp hold

192
00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:53.960
of yet. Because a lot
of this in like, like

193
00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:56.600
you said, the social media
is so innovating, it's so

194
00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:59.000
changing and it's moving, it's
going in so many different,

195
00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.240
right. Different directions at one
time, it's, it's hard to

196
00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:06.680
keep up with. But again,
establishing healthy relationships with our

197
00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:09.920
students and our children would
be the best way forward.

198
00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:12.890
Yeah. I'm trying to get
them to understand the number.

199
00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:14.930
One thing that comes up
with my sons is the,

200
00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:17.060
like, I know you don't
like this, but I am

201
00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:19.490
on your side. Like, if
you could just take every

202
00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:22.190
decision that I offer you
with a little grain of

203
00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:24.920
salt and remind yourself that
my dad is not trying

204
00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:27.560
to like hurt me. I'm
not trying to cause any

205
00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:30.710
trouble here. I'm just trying
to keep you alive for

206
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:32.750
as long as possible until
you get out the door

207
00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:35.240
and then you can get
your own place. Right. I

208
00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:37.520
want you to be happy
and healthy. That is always

209
00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.230
the goal. Like, you know,
but I'm still at that

210
00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:43.460
tween phase where it's like,
you're ruining everything. You know,

211
00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.140
whatever decision I made was
the wrong one. But as

212
00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:47.930
like you guys, can I
get a little benefit of

213
00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:52.010
the doubt, Right? Like playing
video games for eight hours

214
00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:55.330
straight. It's just not, it's
just not healthy. Like I

215
00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:58.030
understand you're trying to get
your feet, your coins up.

216
00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:01.480
Here's a here. This is,
this is real life. This

217
00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:04.360
is my point. This is
real life. I went and

218
00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:09.400
bought a game console and
sports game. Recently years ago,

219
00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:11.560
I played the game and
I was able to play

220
00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:13.990
it enough to where I
was able to earn enough

221
00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:17.320
to buy what I needed.
Now you have to spend,

222
00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:19.600
it has to be four
to eight hours a day

223
00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:22.780
on a game just to
compete, right. Just, and get

224
00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:25.570
your coins up. And so
that you can have all

225
00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:27.700
of these different things. It
was, it used to be

226
00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:30.790
that the student, the children
want it, you know, you

227
00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:34.750
know, the Jordan's on their
own feet, right. Or, or,

228
00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:36.670
or, you know, you have
a 15 year old trying

229
00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:39.100
to get a tattoo. But
now on a video game,

230
00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:41.530
I have to give you
some money so that you

231
00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:46.060
could buy things on the
game. And by the time

232
00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:49.230
Virtual Jordans, right. If I
have, I want real kicks

233
00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:53.730
and virtual kicks, Several peers,
Sarah cares who needs several

234
00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:56.880
outfits in skins on a
game. This is a credible,

235
00:12:57.090 --> 00:12:59.760
this is a credible, but
dad, I won't be cool.

236
00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:02.610
And it's, and you know,
after opening the game up,

237
00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:05.970
I have students all the
time and they're engaging. And

238
00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:09.480
I had to open it
up to understand what was

239
00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:12.270
at stake here because years
ago, all I had to

240
00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:14.790
do was be cool at
school. Right. I just had

241
00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:17.470
to make it through school,
but now it's, it's it's,

242
00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:19.890
I need to be cool
on my social media. I

243
00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:22.470
need to be cool at
school and in this virtual

244
00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:25.620
space on the game as
well, and not just one

245
00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:28.500
game, but all of the
game, the trendy games right

246
00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:32.490
now. So I that's, that's,
that's, that's a, that's an

247
00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:35.250
issue. That's a true, truly
an issue. And you know,

248
00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:40.280
you and I have talked
about addictions prior, but you

249
00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:43.860
can see where these things
are, setting our children up

250
00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:46.920
for tough issues that can
come up later on in

251
00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:49.320
life. One of the things
that I've been trying to

252
00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:53.520
do is use these experiences
when they explore something online,

253
00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:56.940
to pivot to a larger
discussion about like economics. So

254
00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:59.160
like for example, my 11
year old yesterday came to

255
00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:03.570
me because he felt pressured
to buy some coins in

256
00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:06.900
this game today. And I
was like, why is said,

257
00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:08.850
because it's two for one.
So he gets two for

258
00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:11.460
one, or it's 30% off,
right? It's like, it's going

259
00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:14.700
to, it's going to cost
30% more tomorrow. And it

260
00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:17.490
took about an hour of
chatting with him before he

261
00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:20.880
figured out that, you know,
that they can just arbitrarily

262
00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:24.480
raised the prices 30% and
then give you a 30%

263
00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:27.240
coupon. So you feel special.
So we had all these

264
00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:29.340
examples, we started figuring this
out, like, you know, the

265
00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:32.550
bed bath and beyond coupon
for 20%. So I was

266
00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:34.830
like, you know, everything, there
is 20% more expensive than

267
00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:37.260
it needs to be. And
his brain just went like,

268
00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:40.140
Oh, like, they can just
do that. I'm like, yeah,

269
00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:42.060
why not? I can just
make a big Mac and

270
00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:43.470
be twice as much. And
then they give you a

271
00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:45.780
50% off coupon. And then
suddenly you feel special. So

272
00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:48.990
we had the larger conversation
about economics, unfortunately, at the

273
00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:54.800
very end, he said, but
I want the coins, The

274
00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:58.130
fallacy of thrift. If I
remember any fallacy from my

275
00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:01.970
economics class in undergrad, the
fallacy of thrift stands out,

276
00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:05.000
stood out to me. The,
the idea that, you know,

277
00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:07.580
give you all of these
sales. You come in believing

278
00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:10.490
that you're going to Costco.
It's exact one. You go

279
00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:12.890
to Costco, you have your
items that you think you're

280
00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:14.330
going to buy and you
come out and you spent

281
00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:17.900
way more than you actually
thought or intended. And that's

282
00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:21.260
it acting in Zen database
is the best in class,

283
00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:25.400
single secure, scalable architecture for
edge data management. It's the

284
00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:29.030
perfect solution for software developers
who want dedicated application data

285
00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:33.020

287
00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:43.490
compatibility, minimal memory requirements and
exceptionally low support requirements and

288
00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:46.820
better performance than most alternatives
like SQL Lite all means

289
00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:49.880
that you can deliver applications
to customers at scale, across

290
00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:53.360
a wide range of platforms
with direct access from C

291
00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:57.230
plus plus Python and other
popular languages. Zen simple set

292
00:15:57.230 --> 00:16:01.010
of API significantly expands the
pools of developers capable of

293
00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:05.150
building their next business, critical
application on acting Zen. Try

294
00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:09.200
it today at <inaudible> dot
com slash Zen that's act

295
00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:14.830
I a n.com/zen. So here's
a funny thing. We are

296
00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:19.660
back. This is the first
Hanselman it's in 700 episodes

297
00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:22.150
where we each had to
go in to stuff with

298
00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:24.130
our kids and come back
and do the second part,

299
00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:28.270
Which is beautiful. We're talking
about kids and raising kids.

300
00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:30.280
So I lo I went
to Duke TaeKwonDo. What did

301
00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:32.800
you do? We had it.
We had a split. My

302
00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:35.710
daughter did. It does track
and my son plays AAU

303
00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:43.690
basketball. Fantastic. So we're back
like seven hours later. How'd

304
00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:47.260
it go? It went okay.
I'm I'm having a situation

305
00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.900
where the 11 year old
loves TaeKwonDo and the S

306
00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:52.660
the three, 13 year old
was like, If I chew

307
00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:54.640
off one of my fingers,
do I still have to

308
00:16:54.640 --> 00:17:00.520
do TaeKwonDo? That's a little
aggressive man. Like yes. Is

309
00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.950
the answer to that. And
I would rather that you

310
00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:05.380
not chew off your finger.
I don't know where he

311
00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:07.930
had that in his head,
Rather than I'd rather you

312
00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:10.180
not do that. Cause there's
some other things that we

313
00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:14.380
might need that finger for
it. Besides, besides TaeKwonDo. I'm

314
00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:17.830
pretty sure they really, really
are. Yes. We had to

315
00:17:17.830 --> 00:17:21.430
split my daughter. She tried
to do bat. She tried

316
00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:27.750
basketball. She tried ballet. She
tried hip hop dance. She,

317
00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:30.250
she did it a few
things. Lisa, she's only six.

318
00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:35.470
Oh, she's always active at
six. That's great. But now

319
00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:38.380
she's, she's running track. She's
doing the 400 in the

320
00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:41.950
long jump. And we're really
excited for know, she ran

321
00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:48.220
a six, six 33 today
and that's a four eight,

322
00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:52.110
I think that's hundred, 1200.
She ran a mile. She

323
00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:56.190
ran a mile today. So
it's a six year old

324
00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:58.710
running a mile. That's amazing.
I couldn't run an errand

325
00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:05.480
right now. I'm doing TaeKwonDo
and all these, I forgive

326
00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:08.060
me if anyone who's listening
does TaeKwonDo or whatever, but

327
00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:12.650
I have not stretched Kali
in the last 20 years.

328
00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:14.480
And you know, they're trying
to get me to kick

329
00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:16.100
and I'm like, yeah, you
know, kick my hand. And

330
00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:17.540
they hold their hand, six
feet up in the air.

331
00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:19.040
And I'm like, I don't
think that's going to happen.

332
00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:23.960
I'm more of a slap.
Tell me more, You know,

333
00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:26.060
like, like stop with the
kicking and then just like,

334
00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:31.700
move my hands really fast.
You know what I mean?

335
00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:33.950
Like, if there's a problem,
like, I don't know where

336
00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:36.020
I'm gonna have a problem.
I mean, I'm grown, but

337
00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:38.660
if there's a problem, you
know, at the club, wherever

338
00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:43.280
I'm at You and I
will run, I'm gonna give

339
00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:45.380
you all these labs. You
go and get them fast

340
00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:49.010
and fast laps. Right? Like
Bruce Lee speed, slap and then

341
00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:51.590
run. And you're going to
remember the, the back of

342
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:54.050
my head because, cause that's
all you're going to see

343
00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:57.800
all your, so is this
a balance for me? It's

344
00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:01.160
a balance. I know we
work in a tech space

345
00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:05.120
and we have kids and,
and, and I love the

346
00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:09.590
balance. I want them to
feel the realities of life

347
00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:13.280
and I get caught up
in, in the virtual space.

348
00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:15.890
Is it, do you find,
I know I find the

349
00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:18.500
need. Is it, is it,
is it helpful to create

350
00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:21.650
the balance by taking them
out, getting your hands dirty?

351
00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:24.230
I think it's more than
helpful. I think it's absolutely

352
00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:26.930
essential. I mean, I actually
felt pretty good after the

353
00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:30.230
TaeKwonDo today because I'm the
only dad, like not to

354
00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:32.690
put too fine a point
on it, but there's all

355
00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:35.390
the dads and moms are
lined up on these chairs

356
00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:37.670
on the side. And I'm
the, I'm the only one

357
00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:40.160
who's, it's literally like a
bunch of six year olds,

358
00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:42.680
a bunch of 15 year
olds and me and my

359
00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:45.710
sons and I'm the, I'm
the adult and the three

360
00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:48.140
black belt teachers were like
pulled me aside. And they

361
00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:49.460
were like, I think it's
great. You're doing this with

362
00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:51.620
your kids. I just didn't
want to sit there and

363
00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:53.180
check my phone for an
hour. It just didn't seem

364
00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:55.100
like the right thing to
do. So I'm getting exercise.

365
00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.700
Right. I see, I see
I'm this, I am the

366
00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:02.600
same where I'm almost, I'm
almost worse because I'm too

367
00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:06.050
involved. Like I'm at the
practice I'm telling the coach

368
00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:10.160
what play to run. I'm
horrible, horrible. So now I

369
00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:13.130
just stand outside the door
and, and, and watch. But

370
00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:15.470
I, but I understand I've
seen him a whisper the

371
00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:18.660
plays under your, under your
voice. Yes. You know, and

372
00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:20.930
he and my son he's
like ducking me through that

373
00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:23.960
little small slither window. Like
my dad is out there.

374
00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:29.060
No, but the balance is
it's certainly a balance. And,

375
00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:31.740
and as we were talking
about earlier, right. Meeting our,

376
00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:35.330
our hardship, our children, where
they are, right. Where they're,

377
00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:39.890
where they're showing the excitement
and then the balance I

378
00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:44.390
know, and I hate to
chime away at work, but

379
00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:48.400
at the hidden genius project,
we have a partner team.

380
00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:52.690
And, and through that partnership,
we're able to teach sports

381
00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:57.820
coding, and it's remarkable to
take the passions of sports

382
00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:01.660
right. And match it with
the intersectionality between that and

383
00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:06.450
technology, Right. Coding does not
have to be a lonely

384
00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:09.060
thing. It can be a
team thing. Pair programming, mob

385
00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:11.310
programming, have the whole group
work on it as a

386
00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:14.130
team. It's, you know, it
could be competitive team programming.

387
00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:16.650
It can be a joyous
thing, just like anything Team

388
00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:19.560
sport. And, you know, we,
we were talking, we talk

389
00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:22.020
about that. And we talk
about like school and how

390
00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:25.980
students learn. It's funny, the
first PI con I attended

391
00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:30.690
our students were asked, how
did they feel about, you

392
00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:35.490
know, coding in these, in
silos or something to that

393
00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:39.420
effect that had the connotation
where, you know, the students

394
00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:44.070
were confused because the question
meant that coding meant working

395
00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:49.320
by yourself and, Oh, no.
Right. And so they were

396
00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:51.330
like, no, that's not what
we do. We work in

397
00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:55.560
teams. We've learned in teams,
we failed in teams. And,

398
00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:59.970
and, and this is what
the coding is, the community.

399
00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:02.730
And then in, in that
Python, that was, that was,

400
00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:07.350
that was like a resounding
a buzz that the community

401
00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:09.780
of it, everybody can come
in and plug in and,

402
00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:11.790
and be w w what
you want it to be

403
00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:13.830
and who you want it
to be, as long as

404
00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:16.830
you were sharing it and
open to, to the space

405
00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:19.500
and, and open to sharing
ideas. And it was like

406
00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:22.740
the magic and my students,
our students bought into that

407
00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:26.130
magic. And it's funny because
school right, is so like,

408
00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:30.090
you know, great schools are
doing it well, are showing

409
00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:33.660
how working in community and
in groups, how, how, how

410
00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:37.980
much more productive and engaging
and, and, and, and the

411
00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:41.530
learning outcomes around it are,
are that much higher when,

412
00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:44.670
when you promote that. And
so, you know, we're going

413
00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:47.190
back to the TaeKwonDo. You
go back to the community

414
00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:49.370
that even though, you know,
the parents are in the

415
00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:52.200
outside, you know, there's a,
there's still this sense of

416
00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:54.750
community. And this is why
we bring our kids to

417
00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:59.340
these, to these extracurricular activities,
not only, you know, exercise

418
00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:01.080
and quick way to put
them to bed once we

419
00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:04.980
get home. Right. But outside
of that, like, you're building

420
00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:09.870
this community. You're, you're, you're,
you're, you're being diligent. You

421
00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:12.450
have to overcome a lot
of things, even, you know,

422
00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:15.030
our inability to reach our
toes, but we're going to

423
00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:19.680
work at Scott. Right. And,
and showing our kids that,

424
00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:22.440
that, you know, you can
be resilient and not, and

425
00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:24.600
the other part is being
able to fail in front

426
00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:26.760
of them. Right. Cause you're
not going to be able

427
00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:28.920
to do that move that
the black belt does, but,

428
00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:31.500
you know, showing them that
we can work hard to

429
00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:35.040
and accomplish our goals and
setting those examples. Do you

430
00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:37.290
hear that right there? I
heard that. What was that?

431
00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:43.500
Because my son's upstairs beating
on each other. No, that's

432
00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:47.660
not being there practicing. I
hope it's practicing. I'm hearing.

433
00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:50.450
No, one's no, one's yelling.
You're certainly getting your money's

434
00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:54.100
worth. I'm I don't know.
I do think about the

435
00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:56.290
foundation of the house at
some point, Like there will

436
00:23:56.290 --> 00:24:00.940
be some kind of depreciation
narratives Often. What is the

437
00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:02.860
damage that is being done
to my house right now?

438
00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:05.280
You know, one of the
things that I was thinking,

439
00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:09.340
Thinking about the way that
you're teaching technology to the

440
00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:11.650
young man at the, at
the hidden genius project. I

441
00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:14.440
wonder what, you know, in
10 years, when maybe the

442
00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:16.780
16 year olds are 26
and they're doing their first

443
00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:19.600
startup and they're making their
next Facebook, or the next

444
00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:22.990
Snapchat, will they be a
different kind of developer? They

445
00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:26.110
won't be necessarily the same
kind of the, the myth

446
00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:30.250
of the, the, the singular
developer that John Carmack or

447
00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:34.630
the, the Zuckerberg, you know,
all alone in a room

448
00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:37.270
coding. Maybe you're going to
create a new generation of

449
00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:40.210
people who work as a
team where communication is as

450
00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:44.200
important as this myth of
being a genius, hiding out

451
00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:46.360
in a closet with a
pizza coding, the next great

452
00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:50.230
thing. And it's, it's so
part of the culture we

453
00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:53.740
talk about, you know, being
culturally responsive and you're raising

454
00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:57.130
two, two young black male
boys as well. And so

455
00:24:57.370 --> 00:25:00.260
you see that there's a
lot of things missing and

456
00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:04.090
certain aspects of these children's
lives. And, and within the

457
00:25:04.090 --> 00:25:07.510
black community, it's strong, the
culture piece and the community

458
00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:10.600
piece is strong and has
been missing for so long

459
00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:14.470
and not, not missing, just
not highlighted and brought to

460
00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:17.740
a focal point as a
value add to folks lives.

461
00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:22.050
And so this idea of
creating a coding community is,

462
00:25:22.050 --> 00:25:25.090
is so natural. It's so
much more natural for these

463
00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:29.170
young men and for the
community itself, but in particular,

464
00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:31.690
these young men, and they
can build these strong bonds.

465
00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:34.570
And that's what you'll see
within w w we'll see

466
00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:36.910
in the next 10 years,
because we're already seeing it.

467
00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:41.110
Now, we're seeing geniuses out
and that are in colleges.

468
00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:45.640
I'm in Louisiana, we got
to Xavier for instance, and

469
00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:48.370
they're reaching out to geniuses
up in New Hampshire at Dartmouth,

470
00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:52.260
right? And to work and
collaborate on projects together. And

471
00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:55.270
when you build from the
foundation, you build the students

472
00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:57.850
up like this, they'll tend
to do business like this,

473
00:25:57.850 --> 00:26:00.400
and it'll spill over in
their lives. And our mission,

474
00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:05.110
our mission statement includes not
only to change themselves, but

475
00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:09.400
change their communities and we're,
and we're working diligently to,

476
00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:13.150
again, to create this foundational
piece where they're, where everything

477
00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:16.930
they're doing is within community.
They start today, they end,

478
00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:19.720
they eat in community. They
end the day in community,

479
00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:22.480
and we keep them engaged
in that way. So that

480
00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:26.200
it's a healthy habit that
when they create these businesses,

481
00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:30.310
these businesses will be created
with these similar foundations and,

482
00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:33.460
and, and healthy habits. And
one of the things that

483
00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:35.770
I appreciate that about that
is that when I was

484
00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:37.870
coming up, whether it be
in high school or then

485
00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:40.150
in university, no one ever
sat down and talked to

486
00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:43.590
me about personal networking. They
never talked about personal networking

487
00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:48.390
in the context Of building
one's own community. They talked

488
00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:50.940
about it in a more
kind of, for lack of

489
00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:53.880
a better word, kind of
a slimy Glen Gary, Glen

490
00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:56.340
Ross, kind of 1980s, you
know, build your network. So

491
00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:58.080
you can be a better
sales person type of a

492
00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:00.750
thing. And I recently saw
this video from a gentleman

493
00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:04.140
named Watson, who put together
a YouTube, and I'll put

494
00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:07.620
it in the show notes
called building your personal ecosystem,

495
00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:10.860
right? When you build a
community, you're building an ecosystem

496
00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:13.770
of people that you can
call upon for support, for

497
00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:16.710
forwarding that next resume, or
for plugging you in with

498
00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:18.090
the next person, who's going
to move you to the

499
00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:20.730
next rung in the ladder
of your life. And that's

500
00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:23.400
such a more positive way
of thinking about things rather

501
00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:26.990
than teaching people how to
network. And it's so important

502
00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:30.170
that earlier you build that
network and that community, the

503
00:27:30.170 --> 00:27:34.850
better we were talking or
designing a product for our,

504
00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:38.390
our geniuses now, the, you
know, to help them build

505
00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:42.230
their academic networks. And so
there's a lot of noise

506
00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:47.180
on today's social media tools
that like the I'll name

507
00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:49.610
them, the Snapchats and the
Instagrams, where, you know, there's

508
00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:52.850
a lot more entertainment and
a student's ability to kind

509
00:27:52.850 --> 00:27:54.560
of filter out and get
to the meat of it

510
00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:57.620
would be so difficult. So
how can we bring, how

511
00:27:57.620 --> 00:28:01.520
can we bring them together
using technology in a space

512
00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:04.430
that's healthy? And so we
thought to create our own.

513
00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:07.370
And so we started building
our own platform so that

514
00:28:07.370 --> 00:28:10.520
the geniuses can communicate with
each other and call on

515
00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:13.310
each other for academic support.
If I wanted to get

516
00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:16.160
some, you know, some hacks
on one of the new

517
00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:19.010
games, like I know that
I can call, I can

518
00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:22.010
call on this network of
folks, but if it's about

519
00:28:22.010 --> 00:28:25.160
that calculus homework as well,
I can call on a

520
00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:27.410
network of people that can
support. They're all going to

521
00:28:27.410 --> 00:28:31.910
take these classes, right? Similar
classes from high school, through,

522
00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:35.720
through postman, secondary matriculation, they're
going to be similarities. You're

523
00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:37.520
going to be same classes.
There's going to be the

524
00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:40.640
same homework. There's going to
be the same hurdles. And

525
00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:45.260
again, creating that network, that
academic network early, that strong

526
00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:49.460
and encouraging them to, to
utilize, utilize that network has

527
00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:52.910
been like one of the
strongest calling cards of the

528
00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:57.320
year for us. And building
upon that, it's going to

529
00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:59.510
be interesting to see how
this, how this tool turns

530
00:28:59.510 --> 00:29:03.440
out and how they use
it. It really is. I

531
00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:05.870
would say it has just
been in the last year

532
00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:08.900
or two of my life
and my career, which is

533
00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:11.030
longer than the age of
a lot of these young

534
00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:14.390
men that I realized that
having that community to call

535
00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:19.010
upon for, for mental health,
for wellness, for just understanding,

536
00:29:19.010 --> 00:29:21.110
to be able to say,
you know, I have an

537
00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:23.690
issue, like you said, whether
it was calculus or whether

538
00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:25.880
it's a thing at work,
or whether it's just bouncing

539
00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:29.360
an idea off somebody. And
if you don't have that,

540
00:29:29.390 --> 00:29:31.490
that network, you're not going
to have the ability to

541
00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:34.460
manage stress. And you're going
to feel all alone. And

542
00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:37.310
especially if you're entering something
like technology, it can be

543
00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:40.040
a very isolating experience already.
So we don't want young

544
00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:42.430
people to feel alone. And
we need To make sure

545
00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:45.400
that we, as the kind
of the old heads in

546
00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:47.500
the, in the technology industry,
make them feel welcome when

547
00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:50.500
they do show up. Yeah.
And it, and it's all,

548
00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:53.080
it's all around. It's, it's
a balance, right? And it

549
00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:55.600
goes back to you getting,
getting in there and taking

550
00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:59.170
on that class too, right.
Where they are. Right. So

551
00:29:59.170 --> 00:30:02.080
you can understand and not
afraid to, to walk through

552
00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:06.400
those issues as well. So,
you know, as, as parents,

553
00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:10.420
and I definitely encourage, you
know, we, we do these

554
00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:15.580
play dates, right. But we
can, we can help out

555
00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:19.600
and promote these healthy habits
and set, set the, set

556
00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:23.050
these, these teens or any
of these young people up

557
00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:27.190
for success as quickly as
we can. And just understanding

558
00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:31.660
that even it's funny, we're
talking about, you know, what,

559
00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:35.380
what our bad, our bad
experience in life. And we

560
00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:38.530
were always, a lot of
people are always promoting the,

561
00:30:39.010 --> 00:30:42.640
their, their, their trophies or
the awards that have happened.

562
00:30:42.670 --> 00:30:45.610
The accolades, the things that,
you know, folks have celebrated

563
00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:48.160
about a person, but a
lot of times your mistakes

564
00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:51.040
can be supportive as well.
You know, it's a way

565
00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:53.950
to, to navigate through like
what not to do. And

566
00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:56.860
so if, like you said,
it's, if you've just been

567
00:30:56.950 --> 00:31:01.000
taking advantage of your network
as of recently, then, you

568
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.420
know, it's very, it would
be very common upon you

569
00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:07.450
to go ahead and promote
your, your child to, to

570
00:31:07.450 --> 00:31:11.620
build and, and utilize and
get good at following up

571
00:31:11.650 --> 00:31:14.800
with their networking is keeping
your network strong because it's

572
00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:20.580
ultimately, what's going to be
the, in your success. And

573
00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:23.580
I've talked to actually someone
in my life recently encouraged

574
00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:25.980
me to think about the
difference between being a networker

575
00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:28.230
or someone who kind of
like tends to their own

576
00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:32.280
garden, their personal ecosystem versus
being a transactional networker, which

577
00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:34.950
I think is really easy
to get into the bad

578
00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:37.500
habit of just calling on
people when you need them,

579
00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:40.230
as opposed to being genuine
and checking in on people.

580
00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:41.730
When you, when you know
you haven't talked to. So

581
00:31:41.730 --> 00:31:43.440
and so in a while,
I want to actually check

582
00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:44.910
on them and see how
they're doing and see if

583
00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:47.670
I can lift them up
in some positive way without

584
00:31:47.850 --> 00:31:50.580
actually having anything underneath that.
Not this is, this is

585
00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:53.580
true. This is true. This
is very true. I, one

586
00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:56.850
of our first field trips
at, in the program has

587
00:31:56.850 --> 00:31:59.460
been one of my favorite
and we have one of

588
00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:01.860
our, our corporate partner, Google,
and I have a great

589
00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:07.590
friend over there who puts
on this workshop on networking,

590
00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:11.670
resume building, and, you know,
just a followup and the

591
00:32:11.670 --> 00:32:15.060
power of the followup and
the, and the personal note

592
00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:18.480
in that personal note, not,
not, not an email is

593
00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:21.720
great, but if you've ever
sent a card, have you

594
00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:26.160
ever like, when's the last
time you were hard? This

595
00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:27.900
is the thing where my
wife makes me a better

596
00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:30.540
person. She is all about
the personal note. I'm sure

597
00:32:30.570 --> 00:32:33.210
she's probably writing four or
five handwritten, thank you notes

598
00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:36.210
a week. And she's got
me in that same habit,

599
00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:39.650
just some personal emails, great.
Even a text, but personalized

600
00:32:39.650 --> 00:32:41.540
text. You know what that
just write that just an

601
00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:44.780
imperfect animated GIF or that
handwritten note, or that I

602
00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:49.340
appreciate you. It goes so
far. And not just because

603
00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:52.040
we're trying to work the
network, but because we genuinely

604
00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:56.510
care about other humans because
you genuinely care so far,

605
00:32:56.510 --> 00:32:59.720
but we've gotten so far
away from it that it's

606
00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:03.470
become this thing that folks
have used as a transactional

607
00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:07.340
type. Ironically, if we give
back to, you know, making

608
00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:11.510
it something, that's regular, something
that's part of like habitual,

609
00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:14.630
then it can be utilized
for its true value. Again,

610
00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:18.500
again, all things to support
like our trunk, trying to

611
00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:22.520
figure out how to give
everything to these young people

612
00:33:22.910 --> 00:33:25.940
as quickly as possible so
that they can, you know,

613
00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:28.220
start on that path. But
you know, some things will

614
00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:31.820
stick and praying and again,
I'll keep waiting for your

615
00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:35.060
book to come out so
that I can, yeah, I

616
00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:39.230
will eventually get shamed into
writing my book. You know,

617
00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:41.660
one of the things also
that I appreciate about what

618
00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:45.530
you're trying to do is
set people up for success.

619
00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:48.200
You're doing it in a
positive way. You've served over

620
00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:52.610
3,500 students since 2012 giving
almost a hundred thousand hours

621
00:33:52.610 --> 00:33:58.160
of training. People can check
it out@hiddengeniusproject.org. They can donate.

622
00:33:58.610 --> 00:34:00.290
If they're in, in and
around the Bay, they can

623
00:34:00.290 --> 00:34:03.290
get involved. They can send
geniuses your way. They can

624
00:34:03.290 --> 00:34:06.830
become a partner. They can
volunteer, they can check it

625
00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:10.850
all out@hiddengeniusproject.org. And then you
can also hit us on

626
00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:17.540
social media and genius pro
hidden genius pro. Fantastic. Well,

627
00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:22.580
thanks a lot, Shawn Valentine
for this fantastic two-part Hansel

628
00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:25.250
minutes. I appreciate the work
that you're doing. And thanks

629
00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:27.380
for hanging out with me
today. Thank you so much

630
00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:30.290
guys, but I'm blessed. This
