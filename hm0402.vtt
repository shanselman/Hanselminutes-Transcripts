school. Bob Conner, you with
another episode of Connery minutes

11
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.090
today, my guest is Scott
Hanselman. Yay. Hi Scott. How

12
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.350
are you? Hi, you are
recording, right? Yes. You did

13
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.740
push record before you said
that. Yes. Did you like

14
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.140
that? I have been practicing
that intro for a while

15
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.950
now. Yeah, I thought that
was lovely. Okay. Well, I

16
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.480
wanted to talk to you
about a post. You wrote

17
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.210
recently about the programmer coder,
hacker and developer, walking into

18
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.660
a bar, computer scientist, getting
into a, they walked into

19
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.030
a Venn diagram. Yes and
no one got mine. No

20
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.540
one got my humor. It's
actually an oiler diagram, which

21
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.790
cause it's not a real
event. A real Venn diagram

22
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.580
has to have every combination
of set intersect. But some

23
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.070
of these, like, right, if
you look at the diagram,

24
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.890
it's right now, it's on
my blog, like roots phone

25
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.070
that doesn't have a scenario
where roots phone and talks,

26
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.060
human intersect. Only you sir
have been spending too much

27
00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.910
time on hacker news. So
the point is though I

28
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.800
put in two jokes and
no one got any of

29
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.480
it. First I put in
the actual oiler theory as

30
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.030
the equation. And then I
put in a thing that

31
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.920
said that the, you know,
one of the Venn diagram,

32
00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.770
segments is a guy who
thinks a Venn diagram was

33
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.400
the best idea for this.
And every comment was that

34
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.290
that's not a Venn diagram.
It's not actually going into

35
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.270
your answer. You guys you're
missing the point. No one

36
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.250
gets my subtle human. Well,
it says right here in

37
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.840
the comment at the very
bottom, but it should be

38
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.070
shockingly pink and blinking says,
yes, it's really, you know,

39
00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.160
God pedant, you know what
I mean? It's really very

40
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.020
frustrating. Hey, that's what we
get when we write these

41
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.750
posts. Right? Well, well, and
then they were saying it

42
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.760
was an art post about
programmers. So I should have

43
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.010
been more detail oriented because
my original post did not

44
00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.010
compile well, I found this
post interesting because over the

45
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.010
holidays I was talking to
my nephew who is trying

46
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.870
to complete a computer science
degree in Colorado and he's

47
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.870
taking some time off and
he is bartending. And so

48
00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.790
we had a great conversation,
you know, just talking about

49
00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.920
the industry and whatnot. And
he says, it's, I'm finding

50
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.890
it Really hard to leave
bartending. Cause I'm making 700

51
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.080
to $800 a night in
tips alone. Let me, let

52
00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.540
me do the math here.
How many nice does week

53
00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.350
does he bartend? I think
three or four. Okay. So

54
00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.170
Four nights a week, times
four that's shoot. That's like

55
00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.720
a hundred grand a year.
Right? And it's cash. So,

56
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.000
you know, I mean a
hundred grand a year under

57
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.070
the table. Pretty much. Yeah.
I mean he declares a

58
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.190
few, some of it I'm
sure. But so I'm trying

59
00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.670
to talk to him about
starting a career. What do

60
00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.340
you do? And he's telling
me about getting in fist

61
00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.610
fights with certain people who
don't want to leave. And

62
00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.310
I'm thinking, yeah, that pretty
much is like life on

63
00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.170
hacker news and Twitter when
she get involved in the

64
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.170
community. But then I read
your article, which I thought

65
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.020
was fascinating because you're trying
to give advice to a

66
00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.670
friend of yours and how
to get started as a

67
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.660
coder. And you aren't, she's
actually a doctor. That's crazy

68
00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.230
Like an actual, like she's
a psychiatrist and she has

69
00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.100
a practice. Yeah. That, and
there's a lot of people

70
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.520
that are making their way
into the industry. You, however,

71
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.690
instead of going the academic
route layout code Academy, Khan

72
00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:12.000
Academy, code.org and all these
online resources, I find that

73
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.800
interesting. Why are you saying
anything about academics here? Or

74
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.340
are you, are you just
simply suggesting this is a

75
00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.350
way to learn code or
what are you suggesting? I

76
00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.450
like the diagram by the
way. Thank you very much.

77
00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.960
I worked very hard on
that. Well, so if you,

78
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.980
at the beginning of the
post though, I say a

79
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.220
lot, A lot of people
in the conversation started talking

80
00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:36.870
about, well, you could go
here and you could go

81
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.350
there. So if you ask
general people, if you just

82
00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.500
say, Hey, what should I
do? They will give you

83
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.840
code Academy. Like that's the
first one. That's the one

84
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.980
that people will give you.
But I think, And I

85
00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.930
don't actually say it in
the, in the thing here,

86
00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.940
but I think there's got
to be some formalization to

87
00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.740
it. You know what I
mean? Like if I wanted

88
00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.060
to become an electrician, I
couldn't just fall into electrician.

89
00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.950
I have to become an
apprentice and then I need

90
00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.140
to work my way up
and there's unions to join

91
00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.530
and there's there's guidance and
I have to learn the,

92
00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:09.570
the rules. You know what
I'm saying? You can't just

93
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.160
roll into, I don't know,
bootleg, electrician. I don't think

94
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.870
you can. I'm pretty sure
you can't. I don't know

95
00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.280
what I mean. It's just
like, you can't just fall

96
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.090
into brain surgery, but for
some reason, if you imply

97
00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.190
to a software engineer that
they ought to think about

98
00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:27.030
a formal internship, the idea
is like, well, you know,

99
00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.430
you know what, you're insulting
my intelligence. You don't think

100
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.170
I can do it like,
well, no. I just think

101
00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:35.460
that there's value in going
to school. So I actually

102
00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.740
do believe kind of the
opposite of that. Like if

103
00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.320
you want to goof around
and hack stuff together. Sure.

104
00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.530
But what I'm trying to
say, and apparently I said

105
00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:45.780
it in successfully that a
developer is a much larger,

106
00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.380
more well rounded person than
a hacker or a coder

107
00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:51.840
or whatever. You know what
I mean? It's a good

108
00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.810
question. How much of a
foundation do you need in

109
00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.890
order to jump in and
start hacking and, and coding

110
00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:02.240
and whatnot. And does, does
the current academic climate get

111
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.830
you ready for this? I'm
a, I'm a wrong one

112
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.430
to ask. I was a
geologist, right? Well, but so

113
00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:08.260
I would take your sentence.
You just started and you

114
00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.780
went a different direction. You
said, you know what kind

115
00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:12.250
of a background you need
to jump in and start

116
00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:16.540
hacking zero. You need zero.
That's totally cool. But what

117
00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:20.230
kind of a background you
need to join a team

118
00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:23.020
at Goldman Sachs to work
on their next level trading

119
00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.590
platform. You see what I'm
saying? I think that you

120
00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:28.630
need a different set of
skills to do something like

121
00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:31.450
that. Now I'm not necessarily
saying enterprise software, I'm saying

122
00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:33.550
large team software. And I
think that there's a difference

123
00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.940
between the kind of like
it's a startup with four

124
00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:39.460
or five people and we're
making the Nino, we're making

125
00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:43.210
an app versus the I'm
going to go work at

126
00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:47.200
Aflac insurance and, and, and
make the system that runs

127
00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:50.530
$20 billion worth of insurance processing.
You know what I'm saying?

128
00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:55.390
Those are very different skills.
Do you think that a

129
00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:57.520
geologist could do that? Yes.
If they have five or

130
00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.790
10 years experience in software
development, Sometimes I wonder about

131
00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:06.460
that when you're talking about
large institutionalized development, that is

132
00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:09.790
really rigorous and I've been
in those situations many times,

133
00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:13.840
you're, you're, you're writing things
to a spec that is

134
00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:17.860
so clearly defined upfront usually,
right? Sometimes it's a little

135
00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:21.280
bit more iterative these days,
but given that it's so

136
00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:25.090
controlled, I w I might
suggest that it's maybe even

137
00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:28.690
a more comfortable environment for
someone to learn. You know,

138
00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:32.500
that doesn't maybe not doesn't
know everything about computer science.

139
00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.090
What do you think? Yeah,
I think it's a different

140
00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:36.700
kind of structure. I know
that I know that we

141
00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:40.060
have some interns at, at
Microsoft now in the signal,

142
00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:43.510
our team that are probably
20, like 19 years old

143
00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:46.450
or 20, you know, and
they're, they're getting a very

144
00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:51.130
different perspective. Cause they're thinking
about, you know, global security

145
00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:54.070
checks and what's called poly
check, you know, looking for

146
00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.860
that will, this offend people
in a foreign language, if

147
00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:59.290
you name a, an API
this way and like all

148
00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:01.570
these kinds of things that
only the Oracles and the

149
00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:05.110
Googles and the Microsofts think
about that's very different than

150
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:07.810
if they were 19. And
they went to work at

151
00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:11.920
Facebook five years ago. You
know what I mean? Do

152
00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.500
I find it an interesting,
I find it an interesting

153
00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:20.470
thing from my perspective, because
I was self-taught and I

154
00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:23.020
found myself in some really
interesting positions over the years

155
00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:25.630
where I had to make
up my own mind about

156
00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:28.510
a lot of things. And
that was during the first.com

157
00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:30.700
bubble, a lot of startups
trying to make their way

158
00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:34.210
using some upstart technology, which
at the time was ASP

159
00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:37.930
classic. Right. Whereas, you know,
you, you, you work with

160
00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:41.530
the old guard that was
at the time doing Java.

161
00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:44.860
And I remember giggling because
I could move so much

162
00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:47.590
faster, but then again, I
would make all the classic

163
00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:49.630
mistakes that they weren't making.
Do you see where I'm

164
00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:53.200
going with this? So left
alone in a startup world

165
00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.590
where I think people might
think, Oh, you could together

166
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:59.940
some things and, and make
your way. I don't know

167
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:02.460
if that's the best environment
for someone to come along

168
00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:04.800
and try and get a
job. Sometimes I think a

169
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:09.510
more structured environment would be
the best way regardless of

170
00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:11.190
your background. So do you
know what I'm trying to

171
00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:16.650
get out here? No, sorry.
That was a long winding.

172
00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:18.870
That was a long winding
it's. That's why I take

173
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:21.000
over your show to show
people how good you are

174
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.240
being a host. As soon
as my point being is,

175
00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:25.860
let's say I come out
of school, I'm a geologist

176
00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.470
and I've learned some code
I've gone to code Academy

177
00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.840
and I want to do
something I'm arguing that I

178
00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.910
think maybe a better place
for that for me to

179
00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:36.780
go would be large trading
platform. And I can learn

180
00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:38.700
the rigors of day in
and day out. And let's

181
00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:42.270
learn this right. As opposed
to some startup where they're

182
00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:43.710
going to throw some code
at you and say, just

183
00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:45.060
do it. I don't have
time to explain what it

184
00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:48.200
has to happen. Right, right,
right. Yeah. Okay. I mean,

185
00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.940
I appreciate that. You're basically
saying that, you know, there's

186
00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:53.150
different layers, different kinds of
structure imposed by different kinds

187
00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:56.270
of programming languages, different kinds
of environments. If you've got,

188
00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:59.270
you know, four or five,
20 year olds and you

189
00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:01.340
send one to Microsoft and
one to Google and one

190
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:04.100
to do a startup and
one to a research facility

191
00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:08.270
and one to a cancer
research facility versus a computer

192
00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:10.580
science research facility, they're going
to have different levels of

193
00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:13.100
rigor in the code. They're
going to have different levels

194
00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:15.920
of rigor in the development
process. And in the corporate

195
00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.530
culture, I know that we
know when I was doing

196
00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:21.260
like Goldman Sachs type work
on the East coast, even

197
00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.600
though you were a coder,
you were still wearing a

198
00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:26.750
suit to work, you know?
So you'd go in with

199
00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:28.340
your suit. I don't know
how it is now. This

200
00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:29.960
is years ago, but you'd
go in, in your suit

201
00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:34.190
and tie and then you'd
have, you could, you could

202
00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:37.100
loosen your tie when you,
once you were seen, you

203
00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:39.920
know what I mean? Like
you could go in, be

204
00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.600
seen in your suit and
tie, then you could take

205
00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.160
off the suit and tie,
but you still were in

206
00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.850
slacks and dress shoes. That's
very different like that. Wouldn't

207
00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:48.260
I can't even think of
somewhere that would happen on

208
00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.900
the West coast. But what,
you know, I've seen startups

209
00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:52.790
where people just come in
in a hoodie and even

210
00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:57.830
Zuckerberg wears a hoodie, still
that's cult culture, company, culture,

211
00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:00.560
level of rigor. But then
you've got a, I've been

212
00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:03.140
to small startups that are
doing agile the right way.

213
00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:07.370
And they have extremely hardcore
coding gateway. What do you

214
00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:13.830
call that gateways? But what's
it called when you, you

215
00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:15.740
can't check something in because
it doesn't meet a certain

216
00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:20.600
level of quality. I forget
the word for that. I'm

217
00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.460
going to I'll remember it
in a second, but the

218
00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:24.440
idea that, you know, if
you don't meet, meet this

219
00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:26.900
level, then that goes on
getting checked in. You know

220
00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:29.330
what I mean? And it
doesn't matter what you wear,

221
00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:33.950
the rigor that they apply,
isn't societal or isn't, you

222
00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:37.100
know, your, what you decide
to put on, but your

223
00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:39.860
behavior, you know what I
mean? And then I know

224
00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:42.800
other places that, that don't
even think about testing and

225
00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.090
stuff like that. And it's
pretty much like, well, if

226
00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:46.490
Twitter says that our site's
down, then we should probably

227
00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:49.730
do something about it. I'm
not familiar with that. I'm

228
00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:52.280
very familiar with that. Yeah.
Yeah. Like, like they, there

229
00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:54.640
are sites that have said
that like, Oh yeah. If,

230
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.190
if Twitter complaints they're the
best people to tell us

231
00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:59.290
our sites, don't like, they'll
tell us before Pingdom will

232
00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:04.050
tell us. So it's a
small segue. You're turning 40

233
00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:08.160
next week. And that is
quite the, you like that.

234
00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:10.710
Well, I'm reflecting on, we
have to have a get

235
00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:13.320
off the lawn moment whenever
we do Connery minutes. Right.

236
00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:16.470
That's because you're so old.
Yes. I am much older

237
00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:18.810
than you. I keep thinking
that you might catch up,

238
00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:20.670
but it's just doesn't seem
to work out. It's funny.

239
00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:22.890
Yeah. I'm actually not going
to catch up, turns out.

240
00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:28.650
So yeah. Imagine you're talking
to two developers, right? One

241
00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:30.930
of them, they're both very
smart people and one of

242
00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:33.150
them is going to get
a job at GitHub and

243
00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:35.310
the other one's going to
go get a job at

244
00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:41.280
IBM. Let's just say, what
would you tell them? What

245
00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:45.660
would be handsome and Sage
advice IBM versus where a

246
00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:50.160
get hub, let's say, Oh
gosh, First. Yes. I would

247
00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.130
want to know how long
they would be there. You

248
00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:56.970
know what I mean? Like
I've always, I don't, I

249
00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:59.040
don't personally, and this is
just my opinion. I don't

250
00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:02.820
personally like seeing resumes where
someone has eight to nine

251
00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:06.480
months jobs, like 18 months
over and over and over

252
00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.790
and over again. You know
what I mean? I find

253
00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:11.280
that kind of just kind
of, I dunno, I just

254
00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:15.090
find it cheesy if you've
got 10 years of experience,

255
00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:19.590
but you've only ever been
anywhere eight months. That seems

256
00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.630
weird to me. So if
I were going to go

257
00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:25.200
work at either of those
companies, I would definitely mentally

258
00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:28.020
commit to myself. I'm going
to be here for two

259
00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:30.060
to four years. You know
what I mean? I pick

260
00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:31.560
a number cause I could
put up with anything I

261
00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:34.710
could hook up for a
miserable, horrible job, as long

262
00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:37.470
as it's, you know, I
it's, as long as it's,

263
00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:39.810
I'm learning something, but I
think it would be worse

264
00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:42.240
to leave a job after
five months and say, Oh

265
00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:44.100
yeah, I worked at IBM.
We have it for five

266
00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:47.000
months. I mean, seriously, is
that IBM's problem or is

267
00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:50.100
it your problem? Does that
mean It does. I think

268
00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:52.230
the reason I asked the
question is where we started

269
00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:56.190
the conversation before, which is
what's a good place to

270
00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:59.670
learn. Right. And I think
for me, you know, talking

271
00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:01.620
to I've talked to a
number of developers will not

272
00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:04.110
a number of few. Let's
put it that way. Whose

273
00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:07.530
first job was a GitHub
style. And I use GitHub

274
00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:10.860
because it's, it's kind of
this really cool place to

275
00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:13.500
work, you know? And everyone
loves working there and you

276
00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:15.390
work there and you say,
I work at kid hub,

277
00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:18.840
right. It's a really neat
place to work. And I

278
00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:22.200
think that if you start
off there, sometimes the rest

279
00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:24.930
of everything you do is
going to suck. You know

280
00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:27.240
what I mean? So, so
that's like our home run

281
00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:30.270
show that we did on
this developer's life. Yeah. Where

282
00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:32.400
you hit a home run,
like you made Ruby on

283
00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:35.850
rails and unless you make
the next Ruby on rails,

284
00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.200
like what are you going
to do next? Know what

285
00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:42.240
if you're, what if your
first job is the best

286
00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:45.930
job you'll ever, I guess
it's a little depressing, isn't

287
00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:48.240
it? So you think the
best job you could ever

288
00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:50.550
have would be IBM or
get hub? No, I dunno.

289
00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:53.090
I was just using as
a, as a structured argument.

290
00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:55.370
So, you know, you go
to these large structured places

291
00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:57.470
where you sit in a
cubicle, you're handed your requirements

292
00:14:57.470 --> 00:15:00.140
specs, and you have your
code policies that you need

293
00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:02.270
to follow. And you just
sit there and write code

294
00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:04.700
and drag in your designer
stuff. And off you go.

295
00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:08.210
Right. And I'm wondering, you
know, that the people that

296
00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:11.240
move around sometimes I think
this, that the people that

297
00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:14.540
move from job to job
and develop this passion is

298
00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:17.420
because they come from a
place where they just felt

299
00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:20.150
squeezed and they weren't being
fulfilled. And then they have

300
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:22.430
this drive that starts to
build. And then they, boom,

301
00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:26.330
turn into a, I don't
know, passionate developer that blogs

302
00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:28.880
a lot and says, this
is what I've found. You

303
00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:31.370
know, whereas people that I
think are just really happy

304
00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:33.800
straight off from the get
go, I know, I wonder

305
00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:36.320
how passionate they could be.
Do you know what I

306
00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:42.250
mean? Yeah. But I don't
think that you're saying that

307
00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:44.080
you don't think that you
could be a super passionate

308
00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:46.990
developer who works in an
enterprise. Oh, I'm sure you

309
00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:50.230
can. I'm I'm not suggesting
that. I'm just wondering if

310
00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:54.130
there's different levels of fire.
Let's say between someone who,

311
00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:58.330
Jason, where you work Super
satisfied with everything that's going

312
00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:00.790
on and you, you know,
you're like, I need another

313
00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:04.750
job. This is perfect. You
know, how, how fired up

314
00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:06.730
are you to go learn
something new and to try

315
00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:10.930
something different is I guess
what I'm saying, Based on

316
00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:14.200
where you're deciding to go
work. Yeah, exactly. I don't

317
00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.930
know. You know, I've heard
jokes about stuff like that,

318
00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:19.330
where I've heard people say
that like, like we used

319
00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:22.840
to pick on little Debbie
snack cakes, little Debbie snack

320
00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:26.620
cakes. Yeah. We used to
talk about little Debbie snack

321
00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:29.170
cakes, and then it turns
out that we should use

322
00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:30.730
them as a, as a,
as a, what do you

323
00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:34.030
call an archetype? Right. So
we'd say to ourselves, but

324
00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:35.830
what about the guys that
little Debbie? You know what

325
00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:39.310
I mean? Because, and there
was an implication there, a

326
00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:42.850
rude implication that somehow those
guys were not awesome because

327
00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:45.820
they work at little Debbie.
But if you dig into

328
00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:48.340
those things and this is
my opinion again, but if

329
00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:50.230
you dig into the kinds
of problems that they have,

330
00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:52.480
you say, well, gosh, they
actually have some really interesting

331
00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:55.690
problems, a little Debbie, you
know, they have some potentially

332
00:16:55.690 --> 00:17:01.120
interesting issues around supply chain
management, supply chain, chain management

333
00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:03.370
around the life of the
product and making sure that

334
00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:05.950
things get on the right
trucks. I mean, there's, you

335
00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:09.670
can take any problem even
in the most supposedly dull

336
00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:13.450
instances. And it becomes a
really interesting thing. I actually

337
00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:20.590
did some consulting@acompanythatdoeseffectivelymatch.com for truckers,
but not so truckers can

338
00:17:20.590 --> 00:17:23.770
meet each other, but so
the trucks can meet each

339
00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:26.410
other. Ah, see what I'm
saying? You driven a truck

340
00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:30.460
from Portland to Arkansas. You
also gotta drive back. You

341
00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:32.200
have a truck of a
certain size with certain size

342
00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:35.260
wheels, certain sized bed can
hold certain size stuff. And

343
00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.930
you can say, I'm going
back to Portland and they

344
00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:40.240
say, Hey, can you take
this through Denver? And you

345
00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:43.330
say, boom. Right. And that
was just not possible. So

346
00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:47.440
now do that by, you
know, 5 million trucks or 10 million

347
00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:50.310
trucks or whatever every day.
And suddenly things become a

348
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:55.620
really interesting problem. So on
its surface, you might say,

349
00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:57.510
wow, that's a boring job.
You know what I mean?

350
00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:58.910
No, 20 year olds are
going to go, won't want

351
00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:01.800
to work for there. But
at the same time, someone's

352
00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:04.380
going to say, gosh, that
is a really interesting problem.

353
00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:07.050
And I want to work
on interesting problems. So I

354
00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:09.480
don't think you can say
IBM or get hub or

355
00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:13.890
whatever, or Aflac or little
Debbie and then glean someone's

356
00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:16.520
passion or not passion for
the industry. Yeah, I think

357
00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:18.980
you're right. I mean, I'm
not necessarily trying to state

358
00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:21.950
a position. I sometimes just
am curious about it because

359
00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:24.410
I'm naturally, I'm a naturally
curious person. I try and

360
00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:28.580
I try out everything that's
brand new. And I remember

361
00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:31.190
I was talking to somebody
who is a Microsoft developer

362
00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:33.650
and I was trying to
explain why I liked rails

363
00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:35.360
and why I liked Ruby
and why I was learning

364
00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:37.900
it. And they said, I
just have no desire to

365
00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:41.060
do that. And I said,
why is that? And they

366
00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:45.350
said, well, because you know,
asp.net and so on that,

367
00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:47.080
it just does what I
needed to do. And I'm

368
00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:50.290
fine. I'm fine with that.
Which of course is, is,

369
00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:53.810
is that's great. But at
the same time I found

370
00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:56.690
myself thinking, is this a
function? Is their lack of

371
00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:00.950
curiosity, a function of the
comfort level they have? Or

372
00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:04.040
is it just, maybe they're
not an Explorer type? Do

373
00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:06.860
you know what I mean?
Yeah, I suppose. I mean,

374
00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:08.810
there, there is a certain
amount of comfort. I remember

375
00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:11.690
that when, you know, if
you're buying a house, you're

376
00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:13.250
going to think about the
job that you decide to

377
00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:16.970
take and you might take
a safer job, but at

378
00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:20.420
the same time using you
as an example, I'll put

379
00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:22.940
you on the spot. You
know, you quit a perfectly

380
00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:26.060
good job at Microsoft because
there were things that you

381
00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:28.700
just didn't like about it,
the job wasn't working for

382
00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:34.760
you. Right. And one could
argue one, one could argue,

383
00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:36.650
I don't, I'm not necessarily
arguing that this, but one

384
00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:40.340
could argue. That was a
mistake. If the goal was

385
00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:42.290
make as much money as
possible in the shortest time

386
00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:45.020
as possible, you know what
I mean? So you went

387
00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:48.020
and instead went to work
for yourself. So a person

388
00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:51.020
who has safety first would
say, gosh, quit a great

389
00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:56.420
corporate job that ruined your
soul. And you know what

390
00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:58.640
I mean? And went to
work for yourself. You're insane.

391
00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:01.640
Right? You're just, you're just
stupid. But then of course

392
00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:03.830
you build up your company
over the last three years

393
00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:05.810
and then turn around and
sell it to Pluralsight. So,

394
00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:10.910
you know, neener, neener, you
see, when would you have

395
00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:13.400
known that going in? No.
So you basically took a

396
00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:18.050
big bet and you won,
but on its, on its,

397
00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:21.290
on its surface, one could
say, gosh, is that the

398
00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:24.410
right kind of priority? Is
Rob? Well, a lot of

399
00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:27.020
people have questioned me on
that. That's for sure. And

400
00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:29.510
you know, all you can
do is to say, I'm

401
00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:32.300
doing what I do. 300,
you just throw a hundred

402
00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:33.710
dollar bills at them. Or
how does that I do

403
00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:39.730
here at catch Katari makes
it rain. You know, the

404
00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:41.780
interesting thing you're making me
think by putting me on

405
00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:43.790
the spot. Cause I was,
I was sitting here. I

406
00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:45.800
had an idea for this
application I wanted to make,

407
00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:48.730
so I started to prototype
it and I found myself

408
00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:53.140
really missing working in dotnet
and C-sharp, and, and there's

409
00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:55.120
a bunch of things that
it did that would make

410
00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:58.150
what I wanted to do
really easy. Yeah. And I

411
00:20:58.150 --> 00:21:00.370
thought, Oh, I think I'll
do it. I think I'll

412
00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:02.800
do it. And Danette, I
started to do it and

413
00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:06.250
that it was actually too
easy and I stopped. I

414
00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:08.710
stopped. Okay. And you're gonna,
you're going to laugh at

415
00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:09.880
me. And you're probably going
to tell me, this is

416
00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:15.720
very telling I wanted it
to hurt More. Really? Yeah.

417
00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:19.560
And I realized that if
I was to write code

418
00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:22.590
that didn't hurt a little
bit, then maybe I would

419
00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:25.080
stop paying attention. Is that
warped? Or what am I?

420
00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:31.320
You had emotional feelings about
your relationship with Microsoft as

421
00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:36.370
a company. So, you know,
whenever anyone's moving jobs, you're,

422
00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:37.650
you're gonna sit there and
you're gonna say, well, what

423
00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:39.030
are the things I need
to do? You know, I

424
00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:43.590
have to balance my personal
ethics, my personal growth. I

425
00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:46.650
have to balance the pan
pan, the rent, you know,

426
00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:48.290
it's one of those things.
So no, I mean, I

427
00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:50.580
don't think that's weird. I
think you just, you might've

428
00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:54.570
weighed things differently than Yeah.
It was interesting. You know,

429
00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:56.610
I tried to explain to
someone why I like node

430
00:21:56.610 --> 00:22:00.180
so much to now and
it's cause it's so JavaScript

431
00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:01.950
is so messed up, that
it makes you write a

432
00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:05.760
zillion tests and you know,
and I'm afraid. And it's

433
00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:07.470
weird. I tried to explain
to somebody when I write

434
00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:10.650
node stuff, I am afraid.
And I, and I said,

435
00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:14.490
I think that actually makes
my code better. So yeah.

436
00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:17.670
Pain and fear. That's what
motivates me as a developer.

437
00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:21.440
Well, I've talked about fear
before, you know, I've had,

438
00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:23.820
I've had these, we've had
these conversations, I'm totally motivated

439
00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:25.920
by fear. And you want,
I think I talked to

440
00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:29.190
you about this in minutes.
One when I said, I'm

441
00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:32.330
always thinking about, am I
going to get fired? And

442
00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:34.110
I got an email from
someone who was just like,

443
00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:37.050
you know, Oh, you're Scott
Hanselman. You'll never get fired.

444
00:22:37.050 --> 00:22:38.430
You know? And it would
be, you know, you can

445
00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:40.200
always get a job. I
was like, well, yeah, I

446
00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:43.050
know I could find a
job. That doesn't mean I

447
00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:45.060
won't find a job that
I like, you know what

448
00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:47.970
I mean? Like I could
always manage Jack in the

449
00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:50.340
box. I could be a
really great fast food manager.

450
00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:53.430
I'm pretty calm. I could
sell cars. You could sell

451
00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:55.800
little Debbie snack cakes. So
I could totally work at

452
00:22:55.800 --> 00:23:01.590
little Debbie, I think like
a diabetic. Right. You know

453
00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:06.840
what I mean? So, but
that doesn't mean there's not

454
00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:08.790
some fear. I mean, one
is, you know, fear of

455
00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:12.570
not growing fear of not
succeeding, fear of embarrassing oneself.

456
00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:18.150
Those things are our motivators.
Not necessarily primary motivators, but

457
00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:30.030
still motivators. Hmm. Yeah. You
know? Yeah. It's interesting. I

458
00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:31.990
had something I was thinking
about. And it's funny cause

459
00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:34.530
I've been sitting here trying
to diverge the topics enough

460
00:23:34.530 --> 00:23:36.810
that you lose your train
of thought. And then Why

461
00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:40.230
would I, because my mission
would be Completed here because

462
00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:43.650
you want to go to
completely destroy the show. No,

463
00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:45.680
that's when I that's the
whole goal of Connery Munis

464
00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:48.860
is to destroy The show
and I managed to completely

465
00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:50.600
destroy my own train of
thought. Well actually, you know

466
00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:52.490
what threw me? You do
have a train of thought

467
00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:57.700
problem. That's probably why we
can do Oh no. I'm

468
00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:00.130
Joe. No, actually I keep
thinking, you're going to sit

469
00:24:00.130 --> 00:24:01.780
here and offer me that
job again. Cause you know,

470
00:24:01.810 --> 00:24:04.360
I I'm out of work
not after, after this Performance,

471
00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:09.490
If this is the interview.
No, you're not getting that

472
00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:13.840
job. I'm horrible at interviews.
I am the worst. So

473
00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:15.490
tell me, let's take it
all the way back to

474
00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:17.050
the beginning. Let's take it
all the way back to

475
00:24:17.050 --> 00:24:21.340
the beginning. You are looking
at my nephew, right? Oh,

476
00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:25.570
the bartender, the bartender. Yes.
He's got a choice to

477
00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:28.900
go to. He's got a
choice. Three, three choices to

478
00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:31.570
make one. Do, does he
finish his degree or keep

479
00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:34.150
making good money? Right? How
far into it is he?

480
00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:37.630
He's I think almost on
his last year. So this

481
00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:40.270
is a big, so he's
got that choice. Does he

482
00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:42.130
finish his degree and then
go off and try and

483
00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:44.560
find a job too? Yeah.
Should he just stop going

484
00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:47.140
to college altogether and get
a job? Cause he's got

485
00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:50.680
almost a CS degree. And
how old is he? I

486
00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:57.280
think he's 22. Okay. Yeah.
And then the third choice

487
00:24:57.340 --> 00:25:00.880
is to quit his job
and go, so yeah, quit

488
00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:03.010
his job and go work
for like a startup like

489
00:25:03.010 --> 00:25:05.770
GitHub hopper, quit his job,
go to work for Microsoft

490
00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:09.550
or stay a bartender. What
would you tell him? I

491
00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:13.990
feel very strongly about, about
staying in school. I think

492
00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:15.850
I, you know, I've talked
about this before that it

493
00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:20.440
took me 11 years to
do my four year degree.

494
00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:24.580
A lot of people don't
realize that I graduated my,

495
00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:33.280
my bachelor's in software engineering
and 2003. So I've been

496
00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:36.190
in the industry 20 years,
but 21 years. But I've

497
00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:38.770
been in, I have had
a degree for only 10

498
00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:42.550
and I stuck with it.
I stuck with it. I

499
00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:44.650
went to school at night.
I went to school. I

500
00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:46.090
mean, I went to school
online. I went to school

501
00:25:46.090 --> 00:25:49.390
anywhere that would have me.
I made deals with, you

502
00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:52.420
know, with the Dean to
make sure my credit didn't

503
00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:55.240
expire. Like there was a
lot of work because I

504
00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:57.610
started it and I really
believe it's important to finish

505
00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:00.400
what you start. I think
that it's really, really sad

506
00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:01.930
that the saddest thing for
me is when you meet

507
00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:04.150
someone who has a PhD,
but are what they call

508
00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:08.590
ABD all but dissertation, the
dissertation. Yep. Oh man. I

509
00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:10.630
mean, that's just sad, but
in our car, I'm going

510
00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:12.910
to jump in because in
our conversation with my nephew,

511
00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:16.090
I found myself saying for
the first time, I don't

512
00:26:16.090 --> 00:26:18.520
even know if it matters
if you finish anymore, no

513
00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:22.480
nonsense kittens, but to you
that he'll know that he

514
00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:25.330
didn't finish he'll know in
his heart of hearts. And

515
00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:29.050
if the goal is to
just get money then yeah,

516
00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:31.480
sure. Okay, fine. Get money.
You know what I mean?

517
00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:35.350
Okay. Whatever, get money. But
he's 22 and he's not,

518
00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:38.260
I don't think he's thinking
about the long con you

519
00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:40.210
know what I mean? And
if the long con, and

520
00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:42.280
again, this is about priorities,
right? If it's about being

521
00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:46.290
happy and kind of Matthew
McConaughey, You know, do that,

522
00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:49.830
you know, move to Hawaii
and hang out and surf.

523
00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:56.040
But if, if the goal
is to acquire enough money

524
00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:58.830
and equity that you control
your own destiny and you

525
00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:02.250
know, are not the Holden
to your corporate overlords, you

526
00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:04.530
know, you're going to have
to think about your, the

527
00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:09.300
way that you're going to
manage things. Does that make

528
00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:11.370
sense? I mean, I guess
I'm rambling. You've got me

529
00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:15.390
rambling, but the point I'm
making is that I don't

530
00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:17.190
think that he's 22. He's
not really thinking about it

531
00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:19.530
for me. There is a
game in America and that

532
00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:21.990
game is to, you know,
get enough money in, in,

533
00:27:22.050 --> 00:27:23.790
into a pile somewhere that
you can kind of do

534
00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:26.640
your own thing. Other people
argue that you can do

535
00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:29.880
your own thing. If you
just don't have a, a

536
00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:32.400
net at all. You know
what I told them to

537
00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:37.430
do what I need to
call this guy. I told

538
00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:40.400
him to go buy some
books on Python. Okay. Learn

539
00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:45.410
it. Stay bartender, get a
job at a startup. So

540
00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:47.630
I told him, But why
wouldn't he just finish? You

541
00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:49.190
said he's right at the
end. I mean, it's not

542
00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:52.630
like he's a freshman. I
think it's because, I mean,

543
00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:55.220
you know, it costs a
lot of money to keep

544
00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:58.610
going through school. Almost done.
He's burned up. He's taking

545
00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:01.040
time off. He didn't even,
he didn't, he couldn't even

546
00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:05.690
Time off because he's an
entitled. No, no, no. He's,

547
00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:08.720
he's paying he, I know
he is not. He is

548
00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:10.820
one of the nicest kids.
No. I mean, I don't

549
00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:12.560
know the guy from Adam.
I'm just saying like, you

550
00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:14.090
know, is he like, Oh,
I mean, I'm burned out.

551
00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:16.280
I need to find me.
No, I think he's go.

552
00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:18.010
He goes through what you
and I went through. Right.

553
00:28:18.010 --> 00:28:20.810
Why you delayed your degree?
I delayed mine and My

554
00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:24.410
degree because, well, for other
reasons, but okay. Okay. Well,

555
00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:26.840
either way. Alright, I delayed
it because I was wandering

556
00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:28.310
around and I just thought,
well, I'm going to go

557
00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:30.950
travel the world, Trying to
find yourself. Right, exactly. Just

558
00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:32.870
trying to grow up. I
didn't know I was lost

559
00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:37.760
and now you're found that's
fine. Anyway. So I told

560
00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:41.090
him, yeah, go buy Python
books and learn it. And

561
00:28:41.290 --> 00:28:45.500
why Python It's. I mean,
it's pretty accessible and flexible

562
00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:49.460
language. Worried about rotting, his
brain Wanting his brain with

563
00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:52.520
other languages. Pretty much. I'm
not saying Python's perfect. But

564
00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:54.620
if you compare it, if
you compare the complaints that

565
00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:57.140
you see that people have,
right. Between Python and Ruby

566
00:28:57.140 --> 00:29:00.740
and JavaScript and blah, blah,
blah. Yeah. Python to me,

567
00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:03.470
they seem to be, seem
to be something that was

568
00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:06.170
reasonable. I'm not saying it's
perfect, but you know, mm

569
00:29:06.770 --> 00:29:10.460
how's that statement, I'm going
to get emailed out. I

570
00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:12.800
think, Go ahead. Python's a
good language. It works on,

571
00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:15.050
you know, it works on
a raspberry PI. You can

572
00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:17.090
talk to hardware with it
as easily as you can

573
00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:18.890
write a web server. You
know what I mean? It's

574
00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:21.710
a nice, it's a wrist
friendly language and it teaches

575
00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:26.630
kids about what's the word.
It teaches kids about significant

576
00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:28.630
white space, which I think
everyone should learn about. Yeah.

577
00:29:28.670 --> 00:29:31.160
Formatting's built into it. So
your eye gets attuned to

578
00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:33.200
it. I think it's nice.
It's a nice language for

579
00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:36.920
learning. I love C sharp.
It's like, I've told you

580
00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:40.550
this before. It's too much
emotional baggage. It's a first

581
00:29:40.610 --> 00:29:43.330
as a first to go
and learn C-sharp if there

582
00:29:43.330 --> 00:29:46.660
was no non-emotional, you know,
you have lots of emotional

583
00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:51.400
baggage. I'm talking about C-sharp
the problem with C-sharp I

584
00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:55.150
think right now, and with
most languages, is that separating

585
00:29:55.150 --> 00:29:57.310
the language from the libraries.
You know what I mean?

586
00:29:57.790 --> 00:29:59.620
Like I was talking about
this when I talk about

587
00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:03.940
node, right? Like there's JavaScript,
which is half of node.

588
00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:07.480
And then there's the node
base class libraries. And the

589
00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:10.150
funny thing about them is
that there aren't any, you

590
00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:12.160
know, you just have to
go and put them together.

591
00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:13.420
You have to go and
say, Oh, I need something

592
00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:16.090
to help me format dates.
Like, you know, and I've

593
00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:18.610
got to go and find
moment dot JS or this

594
00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:21.520
and that dot JS. And
you end up with 60

595
00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:24.160
different libraries. You know what
I mean? While with the.net

596
00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:26.860
framework, there's this base class
library, which comes with it

597
00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:28.750
and you just have to
learn that, you know what

598
00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:31.690
I'm saying? I do. There
are that's a lot. And

599
00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:32.980
the problem is that you
can put all of your

600
00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:36.340
knowledge into your, you waste
all these brain cells with

601
00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:38.800
information about frameworks. When you
really need to be thinking

602
00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:42.390
about the language constructs. Well,
there are five or six

603
00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:45.960
core modules that are, you
know what I'm saying? I

604
00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:47.610
do know what you're saying,
but just in case people

605
00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:49.770
out there are going to
be confused. I had to

606
00:30:49.770 --> 00:30:52.410
be pedantic for a second.
Sorry. It's my hacker news

607
00:30:52.410 --> 00:30:55.980
moment. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know what I'm saying

608
00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:58.530
though? Yeah. I like, I
like languages that have a

609
00:30:58.530 --> 00:31:04.650
lot of different choices for
the under underlying frame. Absolutely.

610
00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:07.620
I would, I would have
suggested C-sharp cause I do,

611
00:31:07.650 --> 00:31:10.290
I am coming around to
love this language. It is

612
00:31:10.290 --> 00:31:13.740
so capable and I would
have suggested it, but then

613
00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:16.470
you start thinking about link
and you start thinking about,

614
00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:19.320
Oh, how many different ways
do you have to represent

615
00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:22.440
a collection versus a list
or an array? You know,

616
00:31:23.010 --> 00:31:24.690
it's this a lot of
stuff in there. And so

617
00:31:24.690 --> 00:31:27.270
I felt like, well, it's
a good step to language,

618
00:31:27.330 --> 00:31:29.850
you know, once you're done
with Python and you're thinking,

619
00:31:29.850 --> 00:31:31.860
okay, now I want to
build, you know, little Debbie

620
00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:35.100
snack, cakes.com. Well, maybe we
could do C sharp. Yeah.

621
00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:37.050
But the problem that I
have with that suggestion that

622
00:31:37.050 --> 00:31:41.340
you gave him is that
it doesn't, it doesn't deal

623
00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:44.670
with the underlying issue of
like, he's obviously staying in

624
00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:49.110
bartending for the money. And
he obviously doesn't feel that

625
00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:53.610
he wants to finish his
degree or he would just

626
00:31:53.610 --> 00:31:57.630
finish his degree. So there's
some root issues there that

627
00:31:57.630 --> 00:32:00.780
aren't being dealt with. That's,
you know, I think this

628
00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:02.850
is more than a personal
issue and this is why

629
00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:06.420
I just read a Quicksilver,
Neil Stevenson. Have you read

630
00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:09.720
that? And there's a line
in it where one of

631
00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:13.230
the main characters is talking
about why he founded MIT.

632
00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:16.260
And he said, I wanted
to show, and I'm going

633
00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:18.000
to butcher this. I don't
know the exact quote, but

634
00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.640
I want it to show,
I wanted to educate people

635
00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:24.020
with real science instead of
all that other philosophical nincompoops

636
00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:29.880
Marie <inaudible>. I loved it.
It was such a good

637
00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:32.590
word. And I always thinking
that it really is sort

638
00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:35.580
of problem with college these
days, some of the thinking

639
00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:37.140
and some of the teaching
and some of the things

640
00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:42.290
you face are just really
do. They apply in this

641
00:32:42.290 --> 00:32:45.650
world today. You know, you
find classes that people take

642
00:32:45.650 --> 00:32:48.530
that are just, just trying
to get credits to get

643
00:32:48.530 --> 00:32:52.760
through, which really you're trying
to expand your brain and

644
00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:56.090
understand more about the world,
but it's become this system

645
00:32:56.090 --> 00:32:59.000
that you're trying to hack
and get yourself through. And

646
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.310
then you dump a couple
hundred grand along the way,

647
00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:02.720
depending on where you go
to school. You know what

648
00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:05.450
I mean? I guess I'm
a little bit jaded on

649
00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:08.310
at all. Yeah. I think
that the whole third, I

650
00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:10.270
do have to agree and
we should probably end on

651
00:33:10.270 --> 00:33:13.810
that though. The idea of
30 grand a year or

652
00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:15.610
so you can owe a
lot of money is a

653
00:33:15.610 --> 00:33:17.470
problem. You know what I
mean? I do think though

654
00:33:17.470 --> 00:33:19.690
that was software. You can
get a degree and pay

655
00:33:19.690 --> 00:33:23.890
off the degree more reliably
more quickly than if you

656
00:33:23.890 --> 00:33:27.070
got a degree in, I
don't know, social work or

657
00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:29.080
something, you know, it's like,
it's almost like the more

658
00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:32.320
noble the degree, the less
likely you are to be

659
00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:36.460
able to pay it off.
That's true. Well, as I

660
00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:38.800
told my nephew, he could
go get a job at

661
00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:40.840
a startup. See what it
feels like, make some money

662
00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:43.750
and leave and maybe he'll
be really fired up to

663
00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:46.570
go finish his degree later
on. I don't know. Yeah.

664
00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:49.180
Like I think the other
final final question is that,

665
00:33:49.510 --> 00:33:55.390
does this, does this nephew
of yours, like building right

666
00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:57.310
there. That's really what it
comes down to. If he

667
00:33:57.310 --> 00:34:00.160
likes building, then, you know,
let him let him build.

668
00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:02.470
But obviously he doesn't like
building as much as he

669
00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:07.480
likes making $700 a day.
Yup. Well, Scott, thank you

670
00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:09.430
for letting me come on
your show and utterly destroy

671
00:34:09.430 --> 00:34:12.550
it. I hope people are
finding just how good of

672
00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:16.030
a host you are. It's
it's, it's lovely. It's content

673
00:34:16.030 --> 00:34:18.850
free every time you're on.
Exactly. This has been another

674
00:34:18.850 --> 00:34:20.890
episode of Connery minutes. Thank
you so much for listening.
