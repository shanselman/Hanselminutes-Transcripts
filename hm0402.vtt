this is Scott Hanselman. This

10
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.480
is another episode of Hansel
minutes, and I'm here in

11
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.180
Australia, actually at the Yale
conference in Sydney at the

12
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.210
university of new South Wales.
And I'm sitting with a

13
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.460
hotter Hillary, how are you?
I'm good. Thanks for calling.

14
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.740
How are you doing? Pretty
good. Doing pretty good. You

15
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.780
gave your talk earlier today
and I hear that it

16
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.240
went very well and that's
exciting. Yeah. Yeah, it was

17
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.170
good. That's good. Good, good.
And we're both gonna go

18
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.500
home soon. I know we
were definitely looking for after

19
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.750
two weeks being out here.
It's so fun to go

20
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.670
home. I'm ready to go.
Now, you and I were

21
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.700
talking yesterday and you had
some, some ideas that you

22
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.990
seem really excited about and
I said, well, we need

23
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.380
to stop talking and start
recording. Yeah. So now we're

24
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.530
here. Yeah. What do you
got? So, yeah, I mean,

25
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.080
this is, this is it's,
it's something that I've been

26
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.340
thinking about for a while,
right? I was, I mean,

27
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.080
I'll give you a little
bit of a background. I

28
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.170
did. I gave a talk
in DDD, Brisbane that we're

29
00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.540
here now, you know, when
we're in Brisbane and the,

30
00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.560
the title of the talk
was developing in a decade

31
00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.120
and the talk came out
of a couple of months

32
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.480
ago. They, they ping me
from a conference in Norway,

33
00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.100
Trondheim develop conference to give
a keynote there. And they

34
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.470
said, you know, talk about
the trends in 2018. And,

35
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.920
you know, I started to
think like, I mean, I've

36
00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.930
been having this thoughts in
the back of my mind

37
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.640
about where we're heading as
an industry. And I kind

38
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.970
of focus the, talk more
around my, my thoughts around

39
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.220
where we're heading as an
industry, as opposed to where

40
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.810
we're heading from a technical
perspective. Right. And it was,

41
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.690
it was around the idea
of, you know, what are

42
00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.820
we doing us as developers
in, in, in ways of

43
00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.940
improving the world? You know?
I mean, you hear day

44
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.410
and night that the startup
culture and the startups, and,

45
00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.410
you know, in the Valley
and everything, they're like getting

46
00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.810
these venture capitalism and venture
capital money and investments to

47
00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.900
invent ways to, for people
to communicate and to do

48
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.210
great things. I mean, you
hear about Instagram, you hear

49
00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.400
about all of these things,
right. And you start to

50
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.680
think like, okay, how exactly,
you know, are these companies

51
00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.520
Well, I mean, they're just
making it easier for teenagers

52
00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.000
to share pictures, I guess.
Yeah. So, you know, and,

53
00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.220
but it's become like, you
look at like, you know,

54
00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.600
Apple or Steve jobs. Right.
You know, with the iPhone.

55
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.330
Yeah. He absolutely did change
the world. Oh yeah, he

56
00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.560
did. But my, what, what
I started to say, ask

57
00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.280
myself is the, the why,
right. Because you think of

58
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.680
the, the watt, you know,
we know how to do

59
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.380
things. You think of the,
how, you know, what to

60
00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.810
do things, you know, how
to do things, but you,

61
00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.450
I think we've forgotten the
why. Like, why is it

62
00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.240
that we're doing some things
that we're doing? And then

63
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.050
these kinds of thoughts were
combined with, you know, over

64
00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.080
the last decade or so,
I mean, remember how we

65
00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.690
had the industrial revolution. Right.
And they said, well, you're

66
00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.930
going to increase productivity. Right.
So, you know, people are

67
00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.110
going to spend less time
doing repetitive work. And the,

68
00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.940
the industry is going to,
you know, industrial revolution promoted

69
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.150
the, you know, working faster
and better, more efficiently, and

70
00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.030
it would create more jobs.
And lately I'm thinking like,

71
00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.250
are we creating more jobs
with our industry or are

72
00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.650
we destroying jobs at a
faster rate than we are

73
00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.290
creating? And it still seems
like in some, even in

74
00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.500
the glamorous world of software
engineering, there's a whole class

75
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.650
of developer. That's really just
doing repetitive work. Yeah. Just

76
00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.090
snapping things together. Yeah, yeah.
Yeah. So, you know, combining

77
00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.240
that, combining, you know, that
idea of are we actually

78
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.240
creating more jobs, combining the
idea of, you know, now

79
00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.240
with all of the things
that are going on with

80
00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.170
the internet and, you know,
the whole spying and keeping

81
00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:51.000
an eye on us and
stuff like that. And I

82
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.130
just started to wonder like,
where, where the hell are

83
00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.050
we heading? You know, just
where are we heading? Well,

84
00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.180
it does make one wonder
if we've kind of lost

85
00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.920
our way, like as a,
as a culture when, I

86
00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.010
mean culture, I mean, humankind.
Yeah. What exactly are we

87
00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.140
trying to accomplish here? It
seems like, you know, there's

88
00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.780
Western culture, which is really
much trying to worry about

89
00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.140
oneself and one's family. So
there's kind of these circles

90
00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.140
of influence there's myself. There's
my family is my extended

91
00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.200
family and this my neighborhood,
we always talk about it

92
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.700
in the States, at least
about how we don't know

93
00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.100
our neighbors anymore. Yeah. I
think about all of the

94
00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.100
things that are happening in
America that are enabling me

95
00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.410
to have a better life,
but I don't really think

96
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.810
about whether, what my actions
or the things that I

97
00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.060
work on, make my life
better for my neighbors, my

98
00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.520
community, things like that. Yeah.
And then you hear about

99
00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.280
places, like, is it, was
it Tibet? Who, who what's

100
00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.250
the place with the national
happiness index? Like the present?

101
00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.530
Oh, it was Macedonia. I
think it was like, really,

102
00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.000
I'm not like Nepal or
to pet it, but you

103
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.560
know what I'm saying? That
was someone who has a

104
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.110
national happiness index. And they
like at the highest levels

105
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.500
of government, they're like, are
we happy as a country?

106
00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.570
You know what I mean?
Oh, then it wasn't mine.

107
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.030
No. I saw a recent
poll that Macedonia was like

108
00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:57.830
the, the friendliest, nicest place
in the world live really.

109
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.050
Yeah. And then they, so
they do, they clearly must

110
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.260
be doing something. Right. Yeah.
And they're focusing on doing

111
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.970
the right thing. It also
makes one think about all

112
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.210
of all the people in
the Bay that are doing,

113
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:10.760
like I said, photo sharing
and things like that. But

114
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:15.740
then the platforms that we've
forgotten about, like, there's, <inaudible>,

115
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.800
I think it's a, it's
a platform for sharing information

116
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.560
in Africa for getting information
about getting out the vote,

117
00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.490
getting out information about, you
know, how to connect people

118
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.550
who have low bandwidth and
all those kinds of things.

119
00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:34.400
Those are small projects with
small budgets, even tiny Instagram

120
00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.090
is a billion dollars and
projects like shoddy, or like

121
00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:40.070
there's a, there's a really
great project run by Martin

122
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:43.880
Benjamin. That's setting up a,
a universal African language dictionary

123
00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.790
so that people can translate
with SMS. They have a

124
00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:49.100
question about a dictionary word
and they can translate between

125
00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.790
Swahili and Zulu or English
and whatever their budgets are

126
00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:57.550
measuring the thousands of dollars.
But, and that's, that's, that's

127
00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:59.620
where I started to look
at. Right. Because I started

128
00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:03.520
to think, okay, we have,
I mean, you know, this,

129
00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:06.070
it was like a whole
combination of things that were

130
00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:09.580
coming in at the same
time for me. Right. Thinking

131
00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.100
about what it is that
we're doing. I mean, you

132
00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.170
know, I got into this
and I seen them into

133
00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:16.450
the vast majority of people
got into this and into,

134
00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:19.960
you know, computers because I
started to love solving problems.

135
00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:21.820
And then when I started
to see how, the way

136
00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:25.570
I was solving problems was
actually helping people get their

137
00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:28.510
job done faster. Okay. Quite
superficial or whatever you have.

138
00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:30.610
But I started to say,
this is cool. I can

139
00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:33.250
actually sense a little bit
of like, you know, happiness

140
00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:35.500
in someone, because what I've
done is kind of helped

141
00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:40.690
them. Right. So this combined
with, you know, where are

142
00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:42.490
we heading? I mean, I'm,
you know, I, you know,

143
00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:44.730
me, I live in Spain
and Spain right now, the

144
00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:49.390
econ, the financial crisis has
really taken a battering. And,

145
00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:51.700
you know, there's, I see
so many homeless. I see

146
00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:54.310
so many people in it
with, with, with problems and,

147
00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:58.150
and that, and it's just
all started to come together.

148
00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:00.190
And then there was, there
was this other factor, which

149
00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:03.940
was the internet of the
social networks and so much

150
00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:07.060
information, you know, we are,
we are being bombarded by

151
00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:11.110
information. Right. And I recently
read a book, which was,

152
00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:14.170
it was called amusing ourselves
to death. Right. Which is

153
00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:17.410
by Neil postman. And this
was back in 1994. And

154
00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:20.560
he was saying basically how,
I mean, you've all heard.

155
00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:22.570
We've all heard of, He
wrote it in 84 and

156
00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:24.690
84. Okay. I don't, I
I'm interested to hear what

157
00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:26.860
this is about, but even
the title is quite prescient.

158
00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:29.350
Yeah. You know what I
mean? And by the way,

159
00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:33.010
before I forget exactly OSHA
Hedy is that the open

160
00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:35.470
source system in Africa, I
was thinking about, so Neil

161
00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:38.350
postman wrote this book, Call
them using ourselves to death.

162
00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:40.330
And the idea will behind
it, he was, he was

163
00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:44.350
attacking the, the, like the
TV basically. Right. And he

164
00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:49.060
was saying, how in, in
particular American society as has

165
00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:53.410
been promoting this entertainment or
infotainment as you will on

166
00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:56.370
TV, you know what I
mean, basically what he said

167
00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:59.880
with the Telegraph, you started
to become aware of things

168
00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:03.750
that had absolutely no relevance
for you. You know, somewhere

169
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:07.200
across the other side of
America, something had happened. And

170
00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:10.140
it started to come out
in like news daily news,

171
00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.320
you know? And, and he,
you, you look at the

172
00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.270
news today and they say,
you know, that the, the

173
00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:18.780
reporter, the journalists are like,
know, 7,000 people have died

174
00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:21.810
in a flood in, in
Africa and now for something

175
00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:25.820
completely In other news, no
Americans were killed. Yeah. And

176
00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:28.820
you know, Justin, Bieber's coming
to town, You know, one

177
00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:31.010
of the most dramatic. And
again, I'm speaking from an

178
00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:32.900
American perspective and you're speaking
from someone who lives in

179
00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:35.660
Spain, but one of the
most dramatic things I think

180
00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:38.240
that American should look at
is the international covers of

181
00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.850
time magazine. This has done
on a regular basis. Time

182
00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:44.540
magazine is published all over
Newsweek, things like that. If

183
00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:48.530
you look at the covers
when the tsunami, the tsunami,

184
00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:51.140
but the typhoon happened in
the Philippines. Yeah. There was

185
00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:54.680
like nine international additions of
the magazine. Eight of them

186
00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:59.030
had the exact same cover,
concerned about the typhoon. And

187
00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:02.660
the American one mentioned nothing
about the typhoon and it

188
00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:05.480
had a completely different cover.
And the argument is, well,

189
00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:08.900
it wouldn't sell if it
was focused on, on, you

190
00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:11.990
know, important news, arguably. Yeah.
But I mean, it's not

191
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:14.420
only America. I mean, you
get this everywhere. Right. And

192
00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:17.390
so anyway, he wrote this
book about, you know, how

193
00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:20.240
we are like degrading as
a culture, right. And how

194
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:23.360
do we are lost in
a sea of information. Right.

195
00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:27.260
And he was quoting a
guy that you probably know

196
00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:31.220
this was in 1932 Aldous
Huxley wrote a book called

197
00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:34.280
brave new world, where basically
he, there was this dry

198
00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:37.700
called Soma. And people were
created in test tubes while

199
00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:40.310
artificially created, who would have
thought back in 32, who

200
00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:42.770
would think this, and there
would give them different levels

201
00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:45.710
of intelligence so that, you
know, they wouldn't complain. And

202
00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:49.550
people were constantly in orgy
porgies and having like sex

203
00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:53.240
every day from, from small
age and taking this drug.

204
00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:56.870
But everyone was happy. No
one needed books. Everyone was

205
00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:59.570
happy. Right. Nobody looked outside
of the box. Everyone was

206
00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:02.840
continuously, But is it, is
it some larger system that's

207
00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:04.850
causing people to do that?
Like, are they being controlled?

208
00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:08.390
They were being controlled. Population
was being controlled right there.

209
00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:10.700
They were controlling the population
because they were worried about

210
00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:14.840
overpopulation. And they were just,
you know, society was controlled

211
00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:17.840
and their will. And the
powers that be, it was

212
00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:23.330
called the fourteens, or basically
making sure that people wouldn't

213
00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:27.860
step outside of, of this,
of this continuous entertainment. So

214
00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:31.130
what Neil postman was saying
is whether, you know, we

215
00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:34.880
will so worried about Orwell
and this control in this

216
00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:39.080
brother, brother, you know, that
they would ban books, whether

217
00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:42.650
that was really our concern
versus more of a Huxley

218
00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:45.470
society, whether or not when
nobody even cares about books,

219
00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:48.050
you know, That makes me
think of two different images.

220
00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:51.020
The first one being the
movie Idiocracy, if you've ever

221
00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:55.210
seen that, basically the is
to put it into an,

222
00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:57.460
into a really simple example
of one of the opening

223
00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:00.220
scenes. There's a person in
a, like a lounge chair

224
00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:02.650
and he's leaned back and
he's got a giant, full

225
00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:06.820
screen TV in front of
him, giant television, maybe multiple

226
00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:11.350
meters long. Yeah. Except it's
entirely covered in advertising. And

227
00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:14.400
the full, the actual screen
size is quite small. It's,

228
00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:17.290
it's framed almost as if
it is advertised and it's

229
00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:20.140
just reality TV, 24 hours
a day. And the person

230
00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:22.870
has become so immensely fat
that it can't move basically.

231
00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:27.460
And he's just drinking Coke
and watching his ads. And

232
00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:30.220
then that makes you think
about, was it the movie?

233
00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:33.310
Was it Wally? Yeah. I
remember on all of the

234
00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:36.190
people that they discovered where
it was, it was a

235
00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:38.500
Wally, it was one of
those movies where basically everyone

236
00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:40.870
had forgotten how to walk.
They were all hovering around,

237
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:43.960
like in segways because they
were just continuing to entertain

238
00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:48.520
continuously fed had absolutely no
purpose other than to just

239
00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:51.330
simply be. Yeah. And, and
this is Britain back in

240
00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:55.170
1932. Right. And so, so
you take his thoughts of

241
00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:57.840
TV, and then now you
think about like, you know

242
00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:00.210
what? We have net today.
We have Facebook, we have

243
00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:02.430
Twitter. We have, well, there's
a couple of people on

244
00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:05.730
Google plus, you know, it's
like, yeah, there's so much

245
00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:08.940
information coming. And you know,
there was recently a blog

246
00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:12.060
post, which was the 29
steps of a Twitter storm,

247
00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:15.300
which is basically someone does
something wrong. Someone says, Oh,

248
00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:17.460
this is bad. Someone else
retweets, it, someone gets angry

249
00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:21.660
at famous people, hooks onto
it. The politicians get wind.

250
00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:25.530
And this whole, you know,
storm goes on and the

251
00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:29.820
next day something absolutely new
comes once we got it.

252
00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:32.880
And someone invented a hashtag,
you know, and that's it.

253
00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:35.370
And you know, No actual
action as a curtain, nothing

254
00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:38.070
is fixed. There's been a
couple of petitions, but nobody

255
00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:40.170
follows up with the petitions.
You know what I'm saying?

256
00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:42.690
And that's, that's kind of
like what, we're, where we've,

257
00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:45.420
we, we're kind of heading,
which is, it's just like,

258
00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:48.870
you know, everything's becoming relevant
to us. You know what

259
00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:51.290
I'm saying? What do we
do to fix that? A

260
00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:54.540
buddy of mine saw someone
sitting in a, a line

261
00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:57.390
in a queue and he
said he didn't have his

262
00:13:57.390 --> 00:14:02.940
phone out. I hope he's
okay. So I've actually been

263
00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:05.820
consciously, it's a tiny thing,
but I've been consciously trying

264
00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:08.250
when waiting in line in
the queue to put my

265
00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:09.720
phone in my pocket and
just sit there and just

266
00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:13.230
be like, we were five
years ago before the iPhone

267
00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:15.990
was invented. We've forgotten how
to do that. So how

268
00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:17.940
do we fix it? Well,
I mean, there's, you know,

269
00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:22.020
I'm, I'm trying to take
those little steps myself, right.

270
00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:24.960
And they're little steps, but
what I'm, what I'm trying

271
00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:27.450
to think is, you know,
with all this information that

272
00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:29.670
we have and with what
we're seeing in the world,

273
00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:34.860
how can we actually try
and do good right. Use

274
00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:37.710
this information, use this, you
know, the next big thing

275
00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:40.500
is big data, right? Use
this for, Are you thinking

276
00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:46.020
in the context of charitable,
Not, not only charitable works,

277
00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:49.080
I'm trying to figure out
how us, so here's the,

278
00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:50.910
here's the thing. I mean,
to boil this down, what

279
00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:52.580
the does this got to
do with all of us?

280
00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:55.820
I feel that as developers,
we have had quite a

281
00:14:55.820 --> 00:15:01.550
good, you know, a good
position and are quite responsible

282
00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:04.340
for a lot of the
innovation that's happened. Right. Because

283
00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:06.410
a lot of the hardware
innovation has been accompanied by

284
00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:09.830
software innovation. So we are,
you know, we are at

285
00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:13.280
a very good position right
now, right. In society to

286
00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:16.940
influence society, to influence. And
what I want to know

287
00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:19.430
is, what I feel is
that I think that we're

288
00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:24.770
partially also responsible in shaping
society. Okay. Software engineers, software

289
00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:28.310
engineers. Right. So what I'm
starting to question is why

290
00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:30.470
are we doing some things
and how can we do

291
00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:32.630
some things? And instead of
just saying the model of

292
00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:35.140
change, the world actually help
the world. Okay. So what

293
00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:36.670
are some things that you
think we're doing that unhealthy?

294
00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:38.890
You said like just making
random photo sharing and like

295
00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:42.910
social apps, like chasing the
dollar, The dollar. Right. Ultimately

296
00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:45.430
it comes down to if,
if, if our model has

297
00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:48.100
become, you know, all I
want to do is, you

298
00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:50.740
know, come up with an
idea, get a million people

299
00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:55.090
signed up and sell it
off to some VC. I

300
00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:57.730
mean, what have I done?
Right. What have I, You

301
00:15:57.730 --> 00:16:00.010
looked out for yourself, you've
a million books. Yeah. But,

302
00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:03.250
you know, and that's very
respectable. I I've got a

303
00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:04.780
family, you've got a family
and we all got to

304
00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:06.910
take care of our family.
Right. Take care of our

305
00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:10.330
own. But you know, I
want to start to look

306
00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:15.010
beyond that. Right. And so,
but the problem here is

307
00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:17.320
that you say, well, you
can't stifle innovation. You can't

308
00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:21.430
stifle the, you know, someone
wanting to progress and, you

309
00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:24.970
know, be an entrepreneur. And
I started to look on

310
00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:27.730
the internet of, if there
is a possibility to try

311
00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:30.160
and combine these things, you
know what I'm saying? If

312
00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:33.880
there's a possibility to innovate,
to, to be, to be

313
00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:36.010
everything you can, but at
the same time, trying to

314
00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:38.530
help people, Wouldn't that be
something like, if I wanted

315
00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:39.760
to do that, let's say
you and I have decided

316
00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:41.050
to quit our jobs and
we're going to do that.

317
00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:42.850
I would think that I
would go to work for

318
00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:45.640
like the Gates foundation or
Warren buffet, or one of

319
00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:49.600
these kinds of like massive
billionaire philanthropists and try to

320
00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:52.720
make some fundamental change. Yeah.
But I don't think you

321
00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:55.150
necessarily have to do that.
I think that each of

322
00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:58.090
us can take little steps
to help. Right. I don't

323
00:16:58.090 --> 00:16:59.980
think that I have to
come on, quit my job

324
00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:01.660
and go and do something
else because it would be

325
00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:03.940
very preaching and hypocritical than
me to sit here and

326
00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:06.520
say, okay, well, but wait,
you're working for JetBrains selling

327
00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:09.760
tools. And, and you're telling
us that, you know, we

328
00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:13.480
should do something more valuable,
but I think that each

329
00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:17.980
of us as an individual,
we should help at least,

330
00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:20.260
at least start to think
about this. Right. Let's boil

331
00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.990
it down into something actionable.
So I started to look

332
00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:24.850
on the internet and I
started to see some of

333
00:17:24.850 --> 00:17:27.820
these things. Like, for example,
you mentioned that that project,

334
00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:31.120
and I started to find
entrepreneurs that had, for example,

335
00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:34.660
there was, there's a there's
this organization in Africa that

336
00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:38.830
has, there were two guys
seeing that people that had

337
00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:42.820
AIDS and diseases right. Were
waiting months to get any

338
00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:47.110
kind of medication because of
the bureaucracy. So they put

339
00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:49.800
their knowledge to use. They
made a system that allowed

340
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:53.670
the government to process data
faster so that these people

341
00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:57.810
can get their medicine faster.
There's another guy that I

342
00:17:57.810 --> 00:18:01.110
met recently that has set
up a company in, in

343
00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:04.980
India that she's using the
simple concept of text messages

344
00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:07.650
because in India, you know,
it's hard for people to

345
00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:10.110
buy fresh fruit. It's expensive.
So what they do is

346
00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:12.780
they coordinate via text messages.
When they get enough people

347
00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:14.910
to want to buy fresh
fruit, the supplier comes in,

348
00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:17.670
sells and fresh fruit at
a lower rate. They get

349
00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:21.000
fresh food at a fraction
of the price, right? And

350
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.400
these are ways that, you
know, we can actually use

351
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:27.000
this vast infrastructure that we
have. There's so much information

352
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.520
that we have to try
and improve the lives of

353
00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:32.640
those that really need it.
You know, I mean, recently

354
00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:35.550
you saw Twitter had like,
you know, sulfide on a

355
00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:38.010
wall, whatever it's been valued
at whatever. I mean the

356
00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:40.800
IPO of Twitter and you
go to, sorry, not solid.

357
00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:43.710
The IPO has gone public
and you've been San Francisco.

358
00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:46.710
You walk down market street.
Twitter is, you walk down

359
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:51.270
two blocks. It's almost people
it's homeless people. It's drug

360
00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:54.630
addicts. It's, it's, it's just
like, you know, that, that

361
00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:58.830
whole concept of, you know,
entrepreneurs create money that trickles

362
00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:02.040
down and gives investment to
the, to the, to others.

363
00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:04.250
Right. It doesn't, it doesn't
work in the San Francisco

364
00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:07.010
that I've seen in indeed.
San Francisco is one of

365
00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:11.240
the most dramatic examples of,
of, of literally seeing, you

366
00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:13.490
know, billionaires stepping over the
homeless as they kind of

367
00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:14.960
on their way to work.
And it's been, it is

368
00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:18.410
difficult to see. So, you
know, I don't, I don't

369
00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:20.330
know. I mean, I don't
have the answers of saying,

370
00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:22.490
you know, what is the
next immediate action that we

371
00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:24.890
can take? I I'm, I'm
starting to, you know, I've,

372
00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:29.750
I've been doing a couple
of things myself in the

373
00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:34.610
ways I can help, but
I'm not saying that we

374
00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:37.670
should stop what we're doing.
What I'm starting to, what

375
00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:39.770
I'm saying is that we
should start to ask why,

376
00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:42.560
why are we doing it?
And how, instead of just

377
00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:45.290
saying, I'm changing the world,
I'm making the next startup

378
00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:47.270
to change the world is
how can I actually help

379
00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:49.850
those that Now, do you
think this is work that

380
00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:51.560
we're supposed to do on
the side? Like you work

381
00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:53.300
for JetBrains. I work for
Microsoft. Do we do that?

382
00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:56.660
Like now I do open
source on the side. Maybe

383
00:19:56.660 --> 00:20:00.020
I should be talking to
charities, helping them data. Mine

384
00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:03.230
do open source. That is
in a, in a directed

385
00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:06.110
way, I think. Yeah. I
think that this is something

386
00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:09.200
that I'm personally doing on
the side. And, you know,

387
00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:11.900
if I, if I can
do more, I can do

388
00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:14.750
more. If, if one day
I get to do more,

389
00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:18.440
that I can impact more
people's lives. I'll be happy

390
00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:20.780
because ultimately that, I think
that that's one of the

391
00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:23.570
biggest fulfillment someone can have
is how you impact other

392
00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:25.640
people's lives. So when you
put this into the context

393
00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:27.740
of what we originally talked
about, which was the idea

394
00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:29.390
of what our software engineers
are gonna be doing in

395
00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:31.580
the next five years, 10
years, I keep hearing you

396
00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:34.580
come back to the idea
of data and helping those

397
00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:38.900
that are underprivileged, get information
and access to services that

398
00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:41.810
maybe they didn't already have.
It seems to me like,

399
00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:46.400
like connecting people is one
aspect of this, you know,

400
00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:49.720
like whether it be messages
or low bandwidth or enabling

401
00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:52.000
older devices to do things
that don't mean they couldn't

402
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.680
do before. And then there's
also providing context to people

403
00:20:56.860 --> 00:21:00.820
that, that is trapped in
some database somewhere, you know,

404
00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:04.720
connecting, whether it be marketplaces
like a fruit vendor in

405
00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:07.090
one country with a fruit
vendor in the next city

406
00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:10.690
over, or whether it be
just fixing, fixing a broken

407
00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:12.940
bureaucracy so that someone could
get in line, of course,

408
00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:16.500
healthcare.gov.gov is not a good
example of that. But there's

409
00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:19.020
more examples. I mean, there's,
there's another site that basically

410
00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:22.470
connects fortune 500 companies with
skilled workers that are out

411
00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:25.080
of a job right. In
the U S right. And

412
00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:26.790
you sign up, you say,
I've got this skill and

413
00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:30.090
the fortune 500 company that
avoiding gooses, everything goes directly

414
00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:32.550
to you and says, okay,
here, I've got this job

415
00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:36.330
for you. I want it
this right. Whatever dumb. Right.

416
00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:38.160
There's, there's so many ways
I'm just saying we should

417
00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:40.860
start to think a little
bit. And you know, and

418
00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:45.150
the other day, you know,
this is again, combined with

419
00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:47.820
the fact that all we're
doing is innovating, innovating, innovating,

420
00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:50.760
innovating, and wondering, where is
this going? Right. Because like

421
00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:53.610
I was in Minneapolis recently
on a stopover, I step

422
00:21:53.610 --> 00:21:56.550
out of the airport and
I see the restaurants in

423
00:21:56.550 --> 00:22:00.330
the terminal, everyone with us,
every table with twine, iPads,

424
00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:03.630
right. Two iPads. And I'm
like, okay, these people like

425
00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:06.840
to surf. Like I looked
it up every restaurant there

426
00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:10.080
actually, as I walked, had
iPads, Is this a thing

427
00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:13.170
that the airport does for
their restaurants? Or, Well, turns

428
00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:16.080
out that basically what they've
done is they've put iPads

429
00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:18.660
there. Not only for people
to serve, but to make

430
00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:20.520
orders. So you sit at
the table, you make your

431
00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:22.860
order, and then you go,
you collect your food or

432
00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:25.920
whatever, and you can serve
and you pay that. How

433
00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:28.200
many waiters do we just
put out of a job?

434
00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:29.730
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah. I don't know if

435
00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:32.490
that's innovation, that's just kind
of rearranging deck chairs on

436
00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:37.560
the Titanic, but yeah. That
does have an impact on

437
00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:40.110
people. Yeah. That's a funny
one. I think that I

438
00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:42.090
could see, I could see
arguments both ways, like when

439
00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:43.980
someone goes and does something
like that and you say,

440
00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:47.520
Hey, look, it's innovation. Well,
you know, how many, how

441
00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:51.090
much, how many tons of
Silicon silicone, a Silicon rather

442
00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:53.820
we're pulled out of the
earth to make an iPad

443
00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:56.250
and then, you know, put,
put 20 of them there.

444
00:22:56.250 --> 00:22:59.460
So that one person doesn't
have to be a service

445
00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:02.550
worker. Yeah. I don't know
if that's innovation. What I

446
00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:04.800
would like to see as
far as innovation is little

447
00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:07.860
stuff. Like I'd like to
see us look us, the

448
00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:10.080
people from the U S
look overseas. Like one of

449
00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:12.270
the things that I love
when I'm overseas going to

450
00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:16.020
movies is assigned seating to
a movie. You know what

451
00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:17.970
I mean? In the States,
it's every man for himself

452
00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:23.220
and that's not a technical
innovation. That's just a one

453
00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:24.870
country does it. And it
works. And we don't, we

454
00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:28.260
don't do it. I'm surprised
that we aren't looking to

455
00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:31.140
other countries for whether it
be, how does Denmark do

456
00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:36.630
transportation or how does this
country do, how they're service

457
00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:38.730
workers, things like that, and
then change the system for

458
00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:40.140
the better, like, why don't
we look to all the

459
00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:42.960
different countries that have things
that work and then bring

460
00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:46.520
them over here? You know,
you, you see That from

461
00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:48.260
an American perspective and yeah.
And a lot of things

462
00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:50.540
you're right. But I live
in Spain and I see

463
00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:52.940
a lot of things like,
why don't we do, you

464
00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:54.560
know, like this is a
solved problem in the U

465
00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:56.290
S so this is all
funded. I travel a lot

466
00:23:56.290 --> 00:23:58.720
other things that you can
bring to Spain to change

467
00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:01.210
how things work there. Oh
yeah. There's, there's quite a

468
00:24:01.210 --> 00:24:05.980
few beginning with, I would
say, you know, and you

469
00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:09.070
know, my, my, my, your
Spanish audience and, you know,

470
00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:11.170
I've been living there 30
years. So to all practical

471
00:24:11.170 --> 00:24:14.590
effects, I consider myself Spanish.
Right. But, you know, I

472
00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:17.080
think that as a tourist
country, that you know, is

473
00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:20.980
primary thing is, is tourism
industry is tourism. We should

474
00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:26.440
have a better idea of
what service is. So just

475
00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:29.440
starting by that, Do you
think that's something that's how

476
00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:31.420
that might sound like the
podcast is taking a bit

477
00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:33.040
of a turn, but wouldn't
you say though, that if,

478
00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:37.240
if somehow service, you know,
quality service, culture and pride

479
00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:41.110
in work at was ingrained
in all of the different

480
00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:43.960
service workers of Spain, then
over a course of years,

481
00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:45.820
people would get the attitude.
Like, man, Spain is so

482
00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:47.800
friendly and everyone is so
nice. And so kind, and

483
00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:50.950
then that all adds up
to a better economy. It's

484
00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:53.410
not that, no. I mean,
don't get me wrong. Spanners

485
00:24:53.410 --> 00:24:56.050
on unfriendly, Spanish, some of
the friendliest people on world

486
00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:59.230
in the world. And they're
very caring. I, but I've

487
00:24:59.230 --> 00:25:02.440
been there 30 years and
I've seen the service in

488
00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:07.210
terms of customer service go
from absolutely rubbish to, okay.

489
00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:10.000
We're eventually starting to get
somewhere. You know what I

490
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.100
mean? Until 10 years ago
he wanted to go return

491
00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:15.250
something. They're like, what do
you mean return it? I've

492
00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:17.140
got the rest. I don't
care. You got the receipt,

493
00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:19.540
you bought it, you left
the shop it's over. So

494
00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:22.880
I think every country can
learn from any other country.

495
00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:25.480
Really. I don't, you know,
I don't want to say

496
00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:28.360
that this is a problem
that is unique to, to

497
00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:30.970
a specific country. Yeah. Well,
we're just using the examples

498
00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:35.440
cause that's what we know.
Yeah. So, so I mean

499
00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:38.770
to say basically what I'm
just thinking is how I

500
00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:40.480
want to think about why.
And I want to think

501
00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:46.990
about how I can improve,
help people that are not

502
00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:49.420
having a great time right
now. Well, the things that

503
00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:50.980
I try to do and
I keep coming back cause

504
00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:52.990
I have young kids. And
as I keep coming back

505
00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:57.910
to education and opportunity, I
want as many kids or,

506
00:25:57.970 --> 00:26:00.760
and, and, or adults, people
to have an opportunity to

507
00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:03.430
find out what it feels
like to build, to make.

508
00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:07.360
I think we should have
more makers and fewer consumers.

509
00:26:07.450 --> 00:26:09.460
I mean, consuming is fun.
I love TV. I watch

510
00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:13.870
a lot of TV, but
I'm a competent creator. And

511
00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:17.350
I think that right now,
the ratio of creators to

512
00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:21.790
consumers is a little bit
skewed. And I like the

513
00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:24.850
idea of taking someone who
has absolutely no context about

514
00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:27.370
what a software engineer does
and say, let's try to

515
00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:29.380
code something for an hour
and then see if they

516
00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:31.870
get the bug. I'm not
thinking that we're going to

517
00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:34.780
suddenly convert millions and millions
of people, but from an

518
00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:37.750
opportunity perspective, you could take
a, an eight year old

519
00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:40.060
girl and she could go,
I never thought about it

520
00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:42.400
this way. And then boom,
you've just created a software

521
00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:45.210
engineer or it could be
a 65 year old retired

522
00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:49.290
auto worker. And for some
fraction of people it's going

523
00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:52.470
to click and they're going
to go, Whoa, I just

524
00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:54.510
found a new, I just
discovered a new thing. I

525
00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:57.030
discovered that coding and creation
is what I want to

526
00:26:57.030 --> 00:26:59.600
do. Yeah, yeah, yeah. From
a creative point of view.

527
00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:03.440
I think that that's a,
that's, that's, that's a noble

528
00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:06.560
cause to do, but I'm
personally, you know, while I

529
00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:09.950
think that learning how to
program and that is fantastic

530
00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:11.420
and I love it and
I wish that my kids

531
00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:14.540
would program, you know, I
think all of us as

532
00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:16.580
fathers dream that our kids
come and say, Oh, look

533
00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:19.400
that I just wrote this
in JavaScript, JavaScript when I

534
00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:22.370
just wrote this. But I
don't think it's realistic to

535
00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:26.240
want every kid to program
either. Yeah. It's about, it's

536
00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:29.150
about opportunity. Like for example,
growing up, and this is

537
00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:31.070
going a little silly, but
growing up, I never tried

538
00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:34.640
ballet. I don't know if
I'm an expert ballerina. That's

539
00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:36.440
a silly thing to say.
Right. But the point would

540
00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:37.760
be that you want your
kids to have as many

541
00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:40.550
opportunities as possible to try
something. And I was talking

542
00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:43.520
to a gentleman in Australia
here, big kind of rugby

543
00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:46.550
looking guy, Australian football rules
type person. And he said

544
00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:50.540
that his son is going
to be a professional ballerina.

545
00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:52.820
And I chucked the heck
out of me. And he

546
00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:55.160
said, well, yeah, he just,
one day he saw it

547
00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:56.570
on TV. And he says,
I want to try that.

548
00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:59.330
We signed him up at
the local thing four years

549
00:27:59.330 --> 00:28:02.450
later. He's like in Canada
and he's learning at one

550
00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:06.110
of the greatest ballet videos.
And it's just one of

551
00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:08.390
those things like you just
never would have known. And

552
00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:11.030
there's some parallel universe out
there where this individual, this

553
00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:14.510
little boy never had that
opportunity. And whether it be

554
00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:19.580
ballet or baseball or coding,
I, again, I don't think

555
00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:21.830
you're going to create a
nation of coders. Yeah. We

556
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:24.440
don't need a nation of
Cocos Island. I definitely think

557
00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:26.450
that we need a nation
of thinkers. Yeah. And I

558
00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:29.960
think coding is a great
on ramp to, to thinking

559
00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:34.100
and then bringing it around,
arguably a great on ramp

560
00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:37.850
to social change, into improving
lives for people everywhere. Yeah.

561
00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:41.330
Kind of things like Khan
Academy and Coursera and the,

562
00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:44.330
these are doing like again,
helping people that, you know,

563
00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:46.040
there are how many people
in the U S right

564
00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:48.350
now have debts because of
what they had to pay

565
00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:51.560
for college education. It's a
huge number. It's huge number.

566
00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:55.070
And if we're helping people
get educated for free or

567
00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:57.800
a very minimum cost, that
again is helping those that

568
00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:00.620
are really in need. So
I'm just saying that a

569
00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:03.020
software developers, I think it's
time for us to little

570
00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:05.630
bit, think a little bit
deeper about why we're doing

571
00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:09.410
certain things and how we
can improve things for, I

572
00:29:09.410 --> 00:29:10.610
think I want to go,
I think I'll look on,

573
00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:14.180
look online. There surely must
be a marketplace that connects

574
00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:19.370
charities who need help with
coders to do it. They've

575
00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:21.260
got the, you know, the,
what do they call it?

576
00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:23.960
These code camps, not, not
the code camps, the gift

577
00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:28.490
camps. Yes, exactly. Let's give
camp, but I, I think

578
00:29:28.490 --> 00:29:31.160
there are a couple, there
there's actually, it was some

579
00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:34.280
of the dotnet folks that
did this site where you

580
00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:38.300
could contribute to certain projects
that were helping people in

581
00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:41.470
Africa and third world countries.
So there are there be,

582
00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:43.870
I mean, that's The thing
I found so many, so

583
00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:46.510
many people doing things that
help, but they don't get

584
00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:49.150
the coverage on tech crunch
and on Reddit and things.

585
00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:51.100
Yeah. It isn't, it is
a shame. Someone gets a

586
00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:54.100
new, a round of funding
from a VC all over

587
00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:56.110
the place. And I think
that there are, you know,

588
00:29:56.110 --> 00:29:58.480
there are people who are,
who are doing good work.

589
00:29:58.480 --> 00:29:59.980
And I had a couple
of folks on the show

590
00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:03.860
that I'll put in the
show links that are, are

591
00:30:03.910 --> 00:30:06.790
doing work and getting paid
pennies for it, but it's

592
00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:10.000
moving society forward and they're
using code and we should

593
00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.700
give them more coverage. We
absolutely should. Yeah. Thanks so

594
00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:14.770
much, Heidi, for chatting with
me today. Thank you so

595
00:30:14.770 --> 00:30:17.470
much. This has been another
episode of Hanselminutes and we'll

596
00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:18.480
see you again next week.
