Today's episode is sponsored by
Datadog a modern full stack

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.180
monitoring platform for cloud infrastructure,
applications, and logs metrics, all

3
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.420
in one place from their
recent report on serverless, adoption

4
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.200
and trends. Datadog found half
their customer base using <inaudible>

5
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.580
have now adopted AWS Lambda.
They've examined real world serverless

6
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.700
usage by thousands of companies
running on millions of distinct

7
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.060
serverless functions. And they found
that half of the Lambda

8
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.540
invocations run for less than
800 milliseconds, you can easily

9
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.870
monitor all your serverless functions
in one place and generate

10
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.500
serverless metrics straight from Datadog.

That's datadog.com/hansel minutes show to

14
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.070
Scott Hanselman, this Hansel minutes
today. I'm here with Chris

15
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.250
Conner coming up with season
two of altered carbon. How

16
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.730
are you, sir? And yourself?
I am living the dream

17
00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.360
right now and I'm very,
very happy to be chatting

18
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.810
with you. My, my wife
and I, you know how,

19
00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.450
when you love a show
so much that it's like,

20
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.910
do I binge it? And
then I've done this to

21
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.550
myself, then the show, isn't
the thing you've absorbed. It's

22
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.920
a thing you've done to
yourself. And you're like, Oh,

23
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.140
what have I done to
myself? But you love it

24
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.800
so much. You also want
to watch other people watch

25
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.350
the show. So I want
to put an ad on

26
00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.470
Craigslist or something, right. Come
and watch this show so

27
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.800
I can watch you watch
the show. There's nothing creepy

28
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.560
about no it's because I
want them to go. Oh,

29
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.700
and then turn. And I'll
be like, yeah. Yeah. It's

30
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.070
interesting that we haven't come
up with like Skype parties

31
00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.830
for watching shows yet. Why
can't I just call someone

32
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.020
say, let's push them one,
two, three, hit the clapper

33
00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.980
and we synchronize our show
so we can have reactions

34
00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.600
to each other about why
the show is so great.

35
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.520
That's a great idea. I'm
just saying we could go

36
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.730
and patent that right now.
Okay. So a ultra carbon,

37
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.170
I read the books. I've
watched the show and you

38
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.180
play. And for the context
for the folks that are

39
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.400
listening, who may not have
watched the show, I would

40
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.290
encourage you to pause right
now and run off and

41
00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.090
see that I can't guarantee
there won't be any spoilers,

42
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.450
but they'll certainly be thematic
spoilers. But if I may

43
00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.100
and you can correct me
if I'm wrong, the general

44
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.800
structure of this is that
in the future, there are

45
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.130
these things called stacks, which
are effectively USB keys for

46
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.400
people that hold DHF, digital
human freight and digital human

47
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.790
freight is you in a
thing that goes into the

48
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.380
back of the neck. And
it allows us to do

49
00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.660
things like what's called narrow
cast needle cast, needle cast.

50
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.970
You can go and basically
beam yourself to another planet

51
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.070
because it's too tedious to
get on a ship and

52
00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.590
fly there. We'll just upload
you to the other planet.

53
00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.580
Of course, you'd have to
yourself on ice so that

54
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.090
your sleeve, your body is
not double sleeve. You don't

55
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.990
want to have Chris in
two planets at once. And

56
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.220
then it will certainly, if
you apply capitalism that then

57
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.340
really rich people will have
the very best backups. Yep.

58
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.340
Everyone's in the cloud and
then you'll never die. Exactly.

59
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.830
So then people, people who
don't ever die are called

60
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.340
myths, which is like Methuselah
and the Bible. Exactly. Okay.

61
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.690
But you don't play any
of those people? No, no.

62
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.930
I'm an artificial intelligent life
form that has taken the

63
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:39.600
existence form of Edgar. Allen
Poe Is the identity of

64
00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.280
the artificial intelligence that you
play intrinsically attached to ed

65
00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.170
ground pole. Did he exist
in a void and then

66
00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.950
decided this? Did he pick
his sleeve? Yes. In for

67
00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.860
all intents and purposes, the
artificial intelligent life form, I

68
00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:59.820
play has gone through many
different versions. When people watch

69
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.530
the show, they'll see the
floor of the hotel, Raven,

70
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.380
which I am the hotel.
The hotel is me in

71
00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.260
artificial intelligent life form that
is serving humans as a

72
00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.600
hotel. That floor looks like
an MC Escher piece of

73
00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:20.640
art. At some point, my
artificial intelligent life form toyed

74
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.350
with being Essure in the
books. Richard Morgan wrote the hotel

75
00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.890
as the Hendrix based on
Jimmy Hendrix. Fortunately for me,

76
00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.010
they couldn't get the rights
from the Hendrix estate. So

77
00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.100
they ended up settling on
PO for the television show.

78
00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.460
And, and it's been a
joy to be able to

79
00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.690
play someone with such depth
and romanticism and darkness. And

80
00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.300
the fact that there is
that backstory, I think actually

81
00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.240
expands. It makes it even
more interesting because Hendrix was

82
00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.010
certainly complicated, but PO is
well of background information. Yeah.

83
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.030
Yeah. You know, when we
started it, it all the

84
00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.390
process was very quick. When
we began, I got cast

85
00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:04.050
and I was pretty much
shipped off to Canada. We

86
00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:09.840
shot in Vancouver, BC, and
immediately diving into all of

87
00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:17.760
post-work. I knew quite a
bit from college and growing

88
00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.670
up reading a little bit
of Pope, but to actually

89
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.400
delve into his letters, his
life, it really started to

90
00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.210
flesh out the idea of
what the character and the

91
00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.990
true wants of this character
are in our world. As

92
00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.080
far as the television show
goes, Poe in his life

93
00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:39.240
was a profoundly prolific, but
also an incredibly sad individual.

94
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:43.140
Like he couldn't catch a
break, utter object failure. He

95
00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:48.750
distanced himself from most members
of the artistic community by

96
00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:53.730
being a bit of an
ass and had many enemies

97
00:05:53.790 --> 00:06:00.200
and almost every in his
life tragically died. And then

98
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.570
of course he tragically died
and we're still not sure

99
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:05.630
how the circumstances of his
death, but he was beaten

100
00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:09.860
to death and found in
another man's clothes on the

101
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:15.230
streets in Baltimore, incredibly drunk
on laudanum. So it's a

102
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.920
tragic end. He, you mentioned
that he had issues with

103
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:23.360
the women in his life.
His mom, he is, is

104
00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:27.470
his wife in any relationship
with his women was bad

105
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:30.230
or they died? His mom
died right at the very

106
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:33.260
beginning of his life. She
was an actress. Ironically. Then

107
00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.740
he was adopted that woman
who adopted him, who for

108
00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.170
all intensive purposes was probably
the most stable woman in

109
00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:43.940
his life. She died. He
ends up marrying his cousin

110
00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:47.120
who happens to be 14
at the time, years later,

111
00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.180
she does. You could say
the guy just couldn't catch

112
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.760
a break, but he didn't
necessarily put himself in the

113
00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:56.120
best position because he was
a heavy substance abuser. Yeah.

114
00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.240
Yeah. He did not make
good decisions. There's a depth

115
00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:01.820
to the AI of PO
in the, in the show,

116
00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:05.510
but you didn't bring, I
felt the, the pain, I

117
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:07.970
didn't feel like there was
a pain in the AI

118
00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:10.910
APOE. There was a longing,
well, I think that's, if

119
00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:13.520
you go back and read
all of PO's work, that

120
00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:17.600
was the thing that I,
I gleaned specifically, was this

121
00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:20.780
longing, this romanticism, even in
the mask of red death,

122
00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:23.960
which is such a beautiful
story at the very end

123
00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:28.040
it's, it's this almost tranquil
calming, I guess that's not

124
00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:32.750
necessarily a good reference in
these times of calm. Yeah.

125
00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:38.990
But you really see this,
this there's a, there's almost

126
00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:42.380
a sweetness to it. And
I think he, he distills

127
00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:47.000
that in his poetry, probably
better than any American Reiner.

128
00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:48.860
I, I liked that. You
said that there's almost a

129
00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:52.790
sweetness to it because there's
a lot of relationships that

130
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:56.690
poll the AI in altered
carbon has primarily with women

131
00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:02.930
that are incredibly sweet. And
I kept waiting because I

132
00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:05.840
guess I watched too much
TV and I'm just assuming

133
00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:10.190
something bad is gonna happen
for some lurid, some gays,

134
00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:13.280
something literate or in an
uncomfortable, and it never came.

135
00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:16.310
Yeah. Which made me feel
that pose as an AI

136
00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:20.000
was relationships with other AIS
and with people was chased

137
00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:23.420
and kind, but there's still
a longing, but he doesn't

138
00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:27.200
know what he longs for.
Yeah. The, the, the searching

139
00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:30.200
for what the human existence
is, is probably the biggest

140
00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:34.490
quest for Poe's life and
the television show. And within

141
00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:37.820
that, he ends up having
a young ward that he

142
00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:42.140
needs to rehabilitate named Lizzie.
And when we started to

143
00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:46.400
play with that character in
the first season, it was

144
00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:50.180
my job not to make
it lurid. And you want

145
00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:52.220
to be able to root
for this character. And as

146
00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:59.280
soon as something as disgusting
is that comes through like

147
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:06.360
this male gaze, that's not,
that's utterly horrifying towards a

148
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:09.150
young woman. You want to
try to push against that

149
00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:12.780
and make sure it's really
almost a father daughter relationship.

150
00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:15.780
Yeah. And I cheat to
your credit. And I really

151
00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:21.870
appreciate how kind and nurturing
father like uncle, like, but,

152
00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:25.020
but there was also a,
there's a peer relationship there

153
00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:28.830
because it isn't, it's simply,
I am a, a parental

154
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:31.110
figure in your life because
there's a time where that

155
00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:35.430
switches and miss Elizabeth is
really leading you Poe through

156
00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:39.090
an adventure. Yeah, exactly. I
mean, it's almost more sophisticated,

157
00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:42.330
more emotionally, whole than, you
know, in her journey. Totally,

158
00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:45.120
totally. When she flees at
the end of season one,

159
00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:48.930
spoiler, when I cast her
upon the array, it is

160
00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:51.210
a huge jump for her.
It's that it's the big

161
00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:53.490
life decision that, that then
propels the rest of the

162
00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:56.910
story and the ending of
season one. Yeah. It's, it's

163
00:09:56.910 --> 00:10:00.660
a beautiful little storyline between
two characters that could get

164
00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:02.340
very complex. But I think
at the end of the

165
00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:06.090
day is as a story
about love. And she is

166
00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:09.060
a person who is uploaded
into, into the machine and

167
00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:12.000
she has for awhile, no
physical body. And then she

168
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.960
eventually can move around into
synthetic sleeves. We have since

169
00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.390
two, which is a whole
other different part of altered

170
00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:21.360
carbon, which is really exciting.
And if we do get

171
00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.040
a season three, that would
be really fun to play

172
00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.560
with. Yeah. It would be
interesting to understand now your

173
00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:28.410
character is an AI, but
you're not that kind of

174
00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:32.070
typical AI, that's like a
red dot on the, on

175
00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:35.280
the, you know, it's like,
you're not letting disembodied AI

176
00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:38.730
like travelers or something. Yeah.
You're not how you have

177
00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:42.390
a body, but it's a
nano swarm of stuff. Yeah.

178
00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:45.330
Yeah. We played with the
idea of in season two,

179
00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:48.060
we definitely play with the
idea of a hologram form

180
00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:52.500
and then actual nano swarm
form. So a tangible things

181
00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:58.770
like my shotgun are achievable
in the nano swarm forum.

182
00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:02.280
And then in holographic form,
we can play with the

183
00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:06.570
idea of being present intellectually,
but not being there physically.

184
00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:08.610
Which what does that do
to our main character Takeshi

185
00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:12.180
COVID shoe I'm in service,
right? And then COVID eventually

186
00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:14.940
starts carrying you around or
a projector that enables him

187
00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:17.160
to quote unquote, carry around.
So then those times you

188
00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.100
are a projection. Yeah. But
when you are the hotel,

189
00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:22.560
the hotel is you, you
can be in an analyst

190
00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:24.030
warm, you can physically pick
things up and hand it

191
00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:27.960
to people. Yes. And, and
that, that changes throughout the

192
00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:30.300
season, which is really fascinating.
And to see what we

193
00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:32.760
could do with that technology
in the third season would

194
00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:36.150
be really fun. The idea
that you're playing in AI

195
00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:39.390
though, but there's, there's 30,
40 years of AIS in

196
00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:41.910
film. How do you make
sure that you don't fall

197
00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:44.910
into a trope, an AI
trope and obvious easy trope?

198
00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:47.490
That's such a good question.
I was such a huge

199
00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:49.830
fan of so many of
those people who played AIS,

200
00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:54.430
Bret Spiner, who played data.
I think hung with me

201
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:57.850
when I was a child.
And I loved the next

202
00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:01.630
generation as when I was
young, watching him play a

203
00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:06.280
character that was never going
to be a human. And

204
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:10.030
this idea, this trope, I
mean, dates back to Pinocchio,

205
00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:14.290
really where we're talking about
something that is longing to

206
00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:17.560
join a world, that it
can only exist in with

207
00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:20.110
rules that were set by
the people who get to

208
00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:23.170
live in that world. And
how we push against that

209
00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:28.240
is having an artificial intelligent
life form that at times

210
00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:32.590
seems more human than the
people living in this dystopian

211
00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:35.020
society that have been so
cut off from themselves by

212
00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:37.720
technology. That is the trope
that I think we do

213
00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:40.510
appreciate though, the idea that
the AI is the most

214
00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:43.360
human of us. All right,
right. But the other thing

215
00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:44.980
though, is that in the
example of data and other

216
00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:48.130
AI's, they're always struggling to
become human, but they didn't

217
00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:51.760
fall into the easy trap
of trying to give PO

218
00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:54.820
a body and let him
long to be human. He

219
00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:57.790
just longed for connection and
in the connection would find

220
00:12:57.790 --> 00:13:02.800
humanity. Yeah, exactly. I am.
It's really a relationship based

221
00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.170
story. It's about intimacy at
the end of the day.

222
00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:09.070
There's a great quote. I
think it's Juno Diaz, the

223
00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:13.840
author who says real love
or intimacy and paraphrasing intimacy

224
00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:16.780
is letting someone else find
out who you really are.

225
00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:19.810
And there's, that's an idea
that we played with a

226
00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:22.870
lot at the beginning of
season one. And for me,

227
00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:26.680
it related directly to Falstaff's
relationship with Henry or how,

228
00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:30.730
and Henry parts, one Henry Ford
parts one and two, and

229
00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:37.090
in Henry five, that Falstaff
is, I'm a failure as

230
00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:40.360
a human, but how loves
him anyway? Because he sees

231
00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:45.520
all of his failures is
really what drives him to

232
00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:49.840
be the individual that he
is PO in the, in

233
00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:52.300
the, in the, in the
show feels like he is

234
00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:55.930
introspective. He is thinking about
himself. He's, he's keeping a

235
00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:58.690
stock of where he is
in his, how he feels

236
00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:01.210
and how he, you know,
how he is, his journey

237
00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:04.960
goes. Yeah. But to Kashi
his, his, you know, the

238
00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:11.110
Ronin that he follows is
utterly unapologetic, almost has doesn't

239
00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:15.370
care about anything and tolerate
PO yeah. There's kind of

240
00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:17.500
a laptop thing there, but
I'm not comfortable with the

241
00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:21.310
dog or the pet metaphor.
Right. Right. Squire is a

242
00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:22.930
bit of a square. There's
a bit of a Batman

243
00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:26.170
and Robin thing. I think
in the, in the minds

244
00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:28.600
of some of the audience
members I've been told that,

245
00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:32.680
or the one that's been
circulating since season two dropped

246
00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:36.340
was, I'm a bit of
the Tardis and, and to

247
00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:40.030
Kashi is the doctor who,
but I think at the

248
00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:41.950
end of the day, it's,
it goes back to intimacy

249
00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:45.670
between these two characters in
the same way that Poe

250
00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:49.330
is trying to find himself
through, whether it be Lizzie,

251
00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:52.340
his ward at one point,
or whether it be dig

252
00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:54.710
through a one who shows
up in a season to

253
00:14:54.950 --> 00:15:00.140
another AI, into Kashi, he,
he sees a, a friend

254
00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:05.600
and, and to Kashi at
some point, realizes that they

255
00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:09.620
have an intimate connection. It's
season two feels a little

256
00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:12.290
bit like a marriage that's
been around for a long

257
00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:14.420
time. You know, it's 30
years after season one. And

258
00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:19.550
these two entities have been
traveling the galaxy, looking for

259
00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:22.160
something and not finding it.
And it's a bit like

260
00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:25.780
a husband or wife, you
know, stuck at Disneyland. But

261
00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:28.630
at the same time, there
are things happening. The relationship

262
00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:30.760
with miss Elizabeth, their relationship,
like you just said with

263
00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:33.160
dig three Oh one paid
by Tina show hobby, a

264
00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:38.230
very excellently, everyone pole gets
to interact with people with,

265
00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:42.550
with entities across the spectrum
of what is available in

266
00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:45.100
this universe. He gets to
interact with humans. He gets

267
00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:47.890
to interact with synth people
in synthetics leaves, and he

268
00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:51.430
has to have his own
entire emotional relationship with another

269
00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:55.780
AI, with no humans around
what does dig three Oh

270
00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:57.850
one, one, does this show
us that all the AI's

271
00:15:57.850 --> 00:16:01.510
want human interaction in the
season in season one, we

272
00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:06.370
definitely saw that a lot
of the AIS are, have

273
00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:09.550
no use for humans anymore.
They're quite disaffected and, and

274
00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:17.500
malicious. There's a reason why
those sex clubs or some

275
00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:22.420
of the houses of ill
repute are run specifically by

276
00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:26.350
AIS. They are, it requires
an emotional detachment and are

277
00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:30.700
tools of maths who are,
you know, keeping the 99%

278
00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:33.910
down dig three Oh one
was looking for a purpose.

279
00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:37.180
And it's exactly what she
says, a dig without a

280
00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:41.710
dig, because she's actually an
excavator and a anthropologist as

281
00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:44.620
an artificial intelligent life form.
And she uses looking for

282
00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:50.110
something to, to research or
fix, or, and she finds

283
00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:53.230
that, wow, exactly. She, she
finds it as a plot

284
00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:55.300
device in like the plot
and the things that everyone

285
00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:56.890
else is trying to excavate,
but it is in fact

286
00:16:56.890 --> 00:17:00.100
Poe and his pain that
she's trying to go and

287
00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:03.780
excavate and dig into. Yeah.
Yeah. It's very specific to,

288
00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:07.600
that's a Testament to good
writing considering that we've, we

289
00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:10.420
jumped so far away from
the source material, which I

290
00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:13.540
think you have to do
for a television or film.

291
00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:18.100
It's, it's a lovely thing
to see and to get

292
00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:22.510
to act such good storytelling.
And we were lucky to

293
00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:25.420
have Alison chapter as our
showrunner this year, helping us

294
00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:28.600
along the journey. When you
need to focus on building,

295
00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:30.670
do you want to get
bogged down by your database?

296
00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:34.210
Mongo DB is an intuitive,
flexible document database that lets

297
00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:37.360
you get to building Mongo.
DBS document model is a

298
00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:39.790
natural way to represent data
so you can focus on

299
00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:43.090
what matters. Mongo DB Atlas
is the best way to

300
00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:46.630
use Mongo DB. It's a
global cloud database service that

301
00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:49.150
gives you all of the
developer productivity of Mongo DB.

302
00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:53.010
Plus the added simplicity of
a fully managed database service.

303
00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:59.600
You can get started free
with DB atlas@mongodb.com slash mm.

304
00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:03.350
So speaking about the acting
aspect of it specifically, how

305
00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:05.810
do you know when you're
doing this? That it works?

306
00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:07.460
I mean, I'm sure that
there's table reads, but how

307
00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:09.440
did you know it would
work? Yeah, I don't, I,

308
00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:12.920
I never know. I'm terrified.
And I would come home

309
00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:15.080
to my wife every night
and say, this is I'm

310
00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:17.120
going to get laughed at,
this is the worst acting

311
00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:19.100
I've ever done in my
life. It's a leap of

312
00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:21.920
faith, a lot of ways.
I'm a theater actor. So

313
00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:24.800
the suspending disbelief is pretty
easy for me or at

314
00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:27.140
least that's the thing I
have the most joy in

315
00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:29.180
doing. So I have a
good time with it. And

316
00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:33.860
it's a Shakespearian story. It's
larger than life. Hopefully that

317
00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:36.530
we don't turn into such
a dystopian society such as

318
00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:42.170
this. And you, you step
out on the stage or

319
00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:45.500
in this case, in front
of a camera and hope

320
00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:50.480
that someone understands your struggle
and your wants as a

321
00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:52.820
character when they watch the
show. And you hope that

322
00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:54.800
you get to tell a
story like we did in

323
00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:58.820
season two of a character,
struggling with mental instability. Now

324
00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:01.940
you are a guest teaching
artists and you've taught Shakespeare.

325
00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:04.820
You've said you're a stage
actor. What is the difference

326
00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:09.230
between presenting and projecting out
to a room of a,

327
00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:12.680
of a hundred or 300
where you've got about 50

328
00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:18.170
feet of emotional radius? Yeah.
Well art over carbon, tens

329
00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:19.700
of millions of people that
are watching it right now.

330
00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:22.190
Are you acting for those
tens of millions of people?

331
00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:25.940
Are you acting for the
people on set is the

332
00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:28.910
set of stage. Yeah. Sometimes
I, I, we had such

333
00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:31.640
a great crew and they
respond so well as audience

334
00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:33.660
members that it really does
help you as an actor.

335
00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:38.480
I Canadian crews in general,
in Vancouver, British Columbia have

336
00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:41.210
been stellar. And not just
because they laugh at your

337
00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:47.330
jokes, but they are responsive
and, and are nurturing and

338
00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:49.790
helping you as a, as
a performer. I think the

339
00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:53.330
difference between being on a,
a stage that is in

340
00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:56.840
front of 1400 live people,
and the difference between being

341
00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:59.150
in front of a camera,
it's just that it's a

342
00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:03.110
camera is basically an intimate
one person. It doesn't mean

343
00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:07.280
that the size of the
performance changes sometimes because if

344
00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:10.280
you watch some of my
favorite actors, Phillip Seymour Hoffman

345
00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:14.930
comes to mind right away.
Joaquin comes to mind. All

346
00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:20.510
of these guys sometimes are
enormous with their performance, but

347
00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:22.910
because they're so grounded in
front of the camera, it

348
00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:27.920
reads and comes across as
being captivating and really propelling.

349
00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:31.160
As far as telling the
story goes, there were moments,

350
00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:35.180
there are appropriate pauses. There
are seconds that, that extend.

351
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:37.010
They feel like a second
is a minute. There are

352
00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:39.950
moments where you're using your
face. You're twitching, you're moving

353
00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:41.930
in some way. How do
you know that the show

354
00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:43.520
runner, the director, the editor
is going to give you

355
00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:47.350
that space to emote. They
seem to give you of

356
00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:49.300
space. And that's why I
think people are connecting with

357
00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:54.700
Poe. Yeah. The gift of
having bosses and collaborators that

358
00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:57.790
have faith in you as
an artist is it sounds

359
00:20:57.790 --> 00:21:02.290
so pretentious, but it's true
that they give you that

360
00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:06.580
space is it's so far
and few between as far

361
00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:10.360
as being a working actor
to get it. And that's

362
00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:13.570
the joy of streaming services.
Now you don't have as

363
00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:17.440
many suits on set saying
what the audience needs, because

364
00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:22.540
there, while there are still
notes that they're not focus

365
00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:26.590
groups, they're not playing to
some common denominator. That seems

366
00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:30.400
to be what would sell
soap at the end of

367
00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:33.010
the day. Right? That's what
number television really is. So

368
00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:35.140
you've been a working actor
for, for many, many years.

369
00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:38.200
Have there, there have been
suits on set versus this

370
00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:40.510
concept of a showrunner. I've
only heard that word show

371
00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:43.180
runner in the last, like
since the wire, right? Yeah.

372
00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:46.600
David Simon really did a break
out as the show runner.

373
00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:51.250
And now there's so many
people who have a distinct

374
00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:54.220
vision for their show. And
it did usher in the

375
00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:57.640
era of the golden age
of television. Some people call

376
00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:00.550
it the wire being one
of the best examples or

377
00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:03.640
the Sopranos or there's there's.
But if you go back

378
00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:05.890
and you saw what Alan
Alda did with mass, she

379
00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:09.910
really was a show runner
back then the television shows

380
00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:12.670
that are procedurals that at
wild, I still have a

381
00:22:12.670 --> 00:22:16.300
show runner running them. They
are exactly that. They are

382
00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:19.570
a system of numbers that
you put together and you

383
00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:22.840
make something that is more
like a, you know, instant

384
00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:28.030
baked brownies, as opposed to
from scratch and showrunners provide

385
00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:33.040
a, a common thread and
vision that gives everybody the

386
00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:36.400
basis of how to tell
the story, the best to

387
00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:39.580
serve the artistic vision of
what the showrunner wants. Right.

388
00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:41.500
And it also allows, and
this is a wonderful thing.

389
00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:44.800
It allows a diversity of
directors to come in and

390
00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:46.780
you might watch 10 episodes
of something. And you go

391
00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:48.700
out of season seven, had
a flavor to it. What

392
00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:52.180
was that? Oh, that was
guest director who the showrunner

393
00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:55.180
then gave their break. And
they were as opposed to

394
00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:58.060
having the same director for
an entire season or having

395
00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:01.060
a different director. Every episode,
we had the gift of

396
00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:04.810
doing a block shooting and
each director for the second

397
00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:06.490
season and the first season
for the most part, got

398
00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:09.160
two episodes. So you really
build a rapport cause you

399
00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:12.160
really making a two hour
movie with these people and

400
00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:16.450
like MJ, Bassett directed three
and four of season two.

401
00:23:16.690 --> 00:23:21.190
And she's a powerhouse as
far as vision and energy

402
00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:24.130
and pushing a story along
and challenging you as an

403
00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:27.160
actor, asking more of you
than you thought you were

404
00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:31.840
willing to be able to
do in that gift of

405
00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:36.970
having a director who is
I've asking for better storytelling

406
00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:41.710
continually on a daily basis,
only happens now for me,

407
00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:45.440
at least on streaming service
television. When we, as people

408
00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:47.660
who basically see the behind
the scenes stuff at the

409
00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:49.910
end of the DVD, and
we see whatever the YouTube

410
00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:53.000
behind the scenes is, we
see only the thing that

411
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.240
you put on, on film.
And then we see a

412
00:23:56.240 --> 00:24:00.050
still of you standing with
a director, presumably they're giving

413
00:24:00.050 --> 00:24:02.990
you notes, right. That can't
be the complete extent of

414
00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:04.760
that. I mean, he does.
It's like you, you, you

415
00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:06.380
kill it. You do a
whole great scene and they

416
00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:07.340
go, well, let me give
you a couple of notes

417
00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:09.860
and then do it all
over again. Yeah. Are there

418
00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:11.750
one of the times that
they give you that, do

419
00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:14.150
you dress up as PO
and sit at a conference

420
00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:16.640
table and try to like,
this is who I'm thinking

421
00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:20.270
I'm going to be today.
That's funny. Well, close to

422
00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:23.180
it. I mean, you do
you do the, the, the

423
00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:27.620
table read usually, but it,
it, it starts early in

424
00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:31.940
the morning script in hand
walking through the scene on

425
00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:37.700
a set. I come to
the set with my own

426
00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:43.340
idea of what I want
to do. I luckily was

427
00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:48.080
gifted with directors who were
willing to listen to me

428
00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:52.820
and my ideas. And sometimes,
and I've worked with directors

429
00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:56.180
in the past who just
throw out everything the actor

430
00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:58.850
wants and they come up
with what they want and

431
00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:02.000
it ends up being stilted.
It ends up being a

432
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.750
little fragmented and I can
see it in performances. When

433
00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:10.160
you, when I watch it,
the notes as part of,

434
00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:14.900
part of the process during
the day, once you build

435
00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:24.380
a language with a director
like Kieran, who directed one

436
00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:30.080
and two of episode of
season two, he's an Irishman

437
00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:33.830
with a brilliant sense of
humor and could just take

438
00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:37.340
the piss out of me.
And then immediately I would

439
00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:40.400
understand, okay, I need to
lighten this up, brighten it

440
00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:44.090
a little bit. And it's
also, it's a relationship of

441
00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:47.510
trust. It's the same thing
of like you project managing

442
00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:50.720
your own team or having
a, a relationship at work

443
00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:53.930
with people who you expect
them to show up on

444
00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:56.180
time and do what they're
asked to do. It's the

445
00:25:56.180 --> 00:26:00.220
same. There were a number
of, I wouldn't say Easter

446
00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:02.230
eggs, but there were a
little bit of subtle sprinkles

447
00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:04.750
and flavor in, in, in,
in the hotel, in the

448
00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:07.210
background, there were moments that
you needed to pause and

449
00:26:07.210 --> 00:26:08.890
go look at that. There's
one, just put that on

450
00:26:08.890 --> 00:26:12.760
a shelf. Or, and you
also did other things. And

451
00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:15.550
the, for example, the eye
Twitch, was that real? Or

452
00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:19.210
was that an effect or
I'm doing it right now.

453
00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:21.280
She's doing it right now.
What's weird about this is

454
00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:24.250
that I tried this this
morning in my research. I'm

455
00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:28.150
like, can I move one
eye without even a hint

456
00:26:28.210 --> 00:26:30.730
of squinting on the other
eye? And it's fricking heart

457
00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:32.320
of those things. You're not
supposed to be able to

458
00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:34.930
do you remove a couple
of frames? And that's a

459
00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:37.910
really interesting effect to show
a glitch. Yeah. Yeah. Well,

460
00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:40.240
in the first season we
came up with the idea

461
00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:43.320
actually was on the fly.
Well, not on the, for

462
00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:47.190
me. I had, I rehearse
everything beforehand before I get

463
00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:49.350
to work. And so I
had come up with this

464
00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:52.680
idea of downloading data and
having some way of showing

465
00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:57.780
it, right. And then we
got to season two when

466
00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:01.650
the deterioration of posts, mental
state is happening and how

467
00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:04.140
you illustrate that while the
watch helps a lot, the

468
00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:08.490
ticking sound and then the
idea of, Oh, there's a

469
00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:11.550
problem with the connection synapses,
aren't firing in the same

470
00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:14.700
way just to make it
tangible, to, to humans. And

471
00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:18.510
it was me watching a
documentary. I think it's called

472
00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:21.750
me and my mum or
my mum. I'm not sure

473
00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:24.990
which, but it's about a
woman and her mother and

474
00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:28.410
their relationship with her. Mother's
Alzheimer's and it's a British

475
00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:31.260
documentary. It's on YouTube actually.
And I suggest everybody watching

476
00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:36.360
it, but this woman, this
woman's mother laughed and hysterically.

477
00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:39.510
And it's, I think it's
a Samuel Beckett quote, laughing

478
00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:43.350
wild, like it's severest. Whoa.
And it's this beautiful moment

479
00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:46.770
of, of trying to figure
out how you deal with

480
00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:52.170
losing your faculties. And the
Twitch was part of that

481
00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:55.320
on the outside, but the
laughing part and trying to

482
00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:57.900
find some joy in, it
was something that we tried

483
00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:00.090
to instill in season two.
And hopefully we did. Yeah.

484
00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:02.010
There was a, I'm not
sure the right way to

485
00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:04.470
pronounce it. The PA path,
most of there was, yeah,

486
00:28:04.530 --> 00:28:08.190
there was a pain in
the, I'm an, I'm a

487
00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:11.640
freaking AI. This is the
value I provide. I am

488
00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:13.740
this hotel, but honestly, I,
if I am, I am

489
00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:16.770
only my mind and now
I can't even have that.

490
00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:20.340
Yeah. And then the thing
that he needed to, to

491
00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:22.590
hold on to was his
memories of his friends and

492
00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:26.250
particularly miss Elizabeth and to,
to reboot would have been

493
00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:28.710
a death. And now popping
all the way off the

494
00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:30.870
stack to the beginning of
the original conversation. This is

495
00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:35.330
a show where everyone lives
forever, where real death is,

496
00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:37.950
is a rare thing. It
is a dangerous thing. And

497
00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:40.920
Poe is the thing that
should live forever of all

498
00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:43.590
the things that should live
forever of all the useless

499
00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:47.400
myths that have no value,
they should not live forever

500
00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:52.170
pose should. And then he
has to die multiple times

501
00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:55.560
and lose himself. Yeah. Was
a really the moral core

502
00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:59.880
of the entire entire thing.
That's interesting. Yeah. I think

503
00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:02.550
a season two is definitely
a love story and it's

504
00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:06.600
a love story. Not only
for Takeshi and Cal the

505
00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:08.430
main, the, a story you
wouldn't want to call it

506
00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:12.090
of the, of the show,
but for, for PO and

507
00:29:12.090 --> 00:29:14.820
what it means to have
a love of your past

508
00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:16.980
love of your memories, which
is something we all deal

509
00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:19.800
with every day. Well, because
the memories that he was

510
00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:22.650
building were the emotional baggage
that he was packing. His

511
00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:25.080
whole life was figuring out
this puzzle. And I think

512
00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:27.090
it was not just that
he wanted, he didn't put,

513
00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:28.980
did not want to lose
his memories, but he didn't

514
00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:32.100
want to lose the learnings
of the human connection. He'd

515
00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:34.440
have to start all over
again. Yeah. Yeah. I had

516
00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:38.760
this college professor, Brian Johnston, a
brilliant man. He was like

517
00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:42.760
the world's foremost scholar on
Ipsen. Talk about an obscure

518
00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:49.810
specific endeavor, but he always
had this wonderful way of

519
00:29:50.530 --> 00:29:53.530
losing his train of thought
and then getting it back

520
00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:57.700
because it was a bit
of a reminiscence of, of,

521
00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:03.520
of, I am. I am
a brilliant capable man, but

522
00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:06.700
really at the end of
the day, I'm a sack

523
00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:10.690
full of memories that hopefully
someone at some point will

524
00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:15.460
go back and remember it's,
it's, it's, it's tragic. And,

525
00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:18.400
and we deal with it,
especially now is watching the

526
00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:23.470
baby boomers age, watching our
parents fade. Yeah. I have

527
00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:28.030
gone into done recordings of
grandparents and my parents just

528
00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:30.760
doing this, but like just,
you know, if ever there

529
00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:32.770
was a person that you
could record without their consent,

530
00:30:32.770 --> 00:30:34.420
it would be like, you're
your dad. And you just

531
00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:36.130
gotta like, push the record
on the iPhone. I'm like,

532
00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:38.050
how's it going, dad? What's
going on? How did you

533
00:30:38.050 --> 00:30:40.870
meet mom again? And then
she just, you want to

534
00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:44.290
capture those things? Yeah, yeah,
yeah. It's it's, and it's

535
00:30:44.290 --> 00:30:48.940
vital for us to, as
people who want richer and

536
00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:52.360
deeper lives, you know, that
you need to seek the,

537
00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:56.470
not only the comfort of
memory, but that pathos, as

538
00:30:56.470 --> 00:30:59.950
you said earlier, and it's
all a learning experience. Hopefully.

539
00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:03.190
So as we, as we
close our show here, what

540
00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:06.370
do you do with this
character that you love, where

541
00:31:06.610 --> 00:31:09.460
we don't know if season
three or four, 10 is

542
00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:13.720
a thing. There are shows
on television and on streaming

543
00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:15.850
services that have 11 seasons
that we didn't ask for.

544
00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:20.050
I guess you, one of
my favorite tweets that is

545
00:31:20.050 --> 00:31:23.580
a compliment to you was
that you, you called the,

546
00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:26.180
the Kel and Takeshi the
AA story. But someone said,

547
00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:28.900
well, you know, the whole
Takeshi thing, like the whole

548
00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:32.200
main character is really just
a MacGuffin to move the,

549
00:31:32.210 --> 00:31:36.190
the, the emotional story that
is PO forward. That's funny.

550
00:31:37.210 --> 00:31:40.150
I think that, yeah, it's,
it's kind that someone said

551
00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:46.330
that, but I think if
season three does happen, maybe

552
00:31:46.330 --> 00:31:50.650
getting back to more of
a Sherlockian detective story and

553
00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:54.280
Watson and Holmes, and I
would get back alongside the

554
00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:56.500
Kashi would be really fun
to play the buddy, the

555
00:31:56.500 --> 00:32:00.730
buddy movie. Yeah. Yeah. I
mean, I, I miss that

556
00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:03.130
relationship a lot. We did,
we touch on it a

557
00:32:03.130 --> 00:32:06.070
little bit in season two,
but it would be really

558
00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:09.100
fun to get back in
and solve a crime. Absolutely.

559
00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:11.320
Thank you so much, Chris
Connor for taking the time

560
00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:12.760
to chat with me today.
Oh, it was my pleasure.

561
00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:15.910
Anytime. This has been another
episode of Hansel minutes and

562
00:32:15.910 --> 00:32:29.430
we will see you again.
Next time. <inaudible>.
