And I'll remind you that

7
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:47.150
when you support our sponsors,
you support this show. Scott

8
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.370
Hanselman. This is another episode
of Hansel minutes today. I'm

9
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.990
talking with Courtney Nash, holloway.com.
How are you, Scott? How

10
00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.370
are you? Very well. I
am working remotely, certainly, but

11
00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.320
I've been doing that for
13 years, but somehow the

12
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.890
current situation as we record
this in March of 2020,

13
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.470
I just feel somehow more
remote. I feel farther away

14
00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.560
from people than usual. I
think we all feel, I

15
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.660
think it's a weird mix
for me. I feel I've

16
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.110
been working remotely myself for
over about 11 years now,

17
00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.760
and I feel more remote
in some ways and almost

18
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.350
weirdly more connected or maybe
just attached to my phone.

19
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.220
Twitter. Maybe it's not the
same thing I suppose, but

20
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.080
more people are caring about
and interested in how everyone's

21
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.260
going to handle this. And
so I feel less alone

22
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.440
being a remote worker than
I did before. So it's,

23
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.300
it's a weird mix for
me. I'd have to say,

24
00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.520
I'm hoping that the, the
empathy of the remote experience

25
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.640
increases. And then when everyone
goes back, it won't be,

26
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.440
they won't forget. You know,
because we are w I

27
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.260
I've said this before, and
I think I say it

28
00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.580
with love and people who
are differently abled will understand

29
00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.190
the metaphor, but when you
are remote or the only

30
00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.430
remote in a entirely, let's
all go to the office

31
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.790
and sit together team, you
are differently abled, and they

32
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.210
can leave the room and
you'll be like, Hey, anybody

33
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.370
you go, Oh, I guess
you all left. And they

34
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.100
just leave you there. You
can't move. They can't see,

35
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.720
you can't see them if
they don't turn their cameras

36
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.580
on. So you can't see
if they're rolling their eyes

37
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.600
at you. You lose a
lot. Maybe now they will

38
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:29.030
appreciate us. I certainly hope
so. I've, I've always worked

39
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.750
at hybrid remote kinds of
organizations. I've never been the

40
00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.990
sole remote person though, but
I, I have a great

41
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.410
deal of empathy for how
much harder. That must be

42
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.320
more so than even at
least, if you have a

43
00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.470
band of other remote people
and hopefully, maybe a company

44
00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.880
that is aware of what
that separation is like, then

45
00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.160
it's a bit better. But
yeah, the, the, I think

46
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.320
there's no there's far fewer,
still remote people out there

47
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.860
anymore after what's happened recently.
And I agree that empathy,

48
00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.580
I don't think it's something
people forget after this, especially

49
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:01.930
I, the thing I want
to point out though, is

50
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.850
this is not normal remote.
I saw someone say someone

51
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.460
wrote something the other day
that was folks were not

52
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.390
working from home. This isn't
w you know, FH, this

53
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.780
is w DP it's working
during a pandemic. Yeah, it

54
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.420
is definitely not the same
you're being forced to and

55
00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.370
having, you know, and choosing
to are very, very different

56
00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.560
things. Yeah. But I think
that the benefit of all

57
00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.480
of this, as we said,
is that empathy will be

58
00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.940
increased. People will start checking
on each other and then

59
00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.390
normalizing little kids wandering in
a meeting sometimes. And also

60
00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.900
appreciating that while sometimes I
felt in the past, people

61
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.910
look at me working remotely,
Oh man, you got a

62
00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.340
sweet deal. I answer when,
I mean, you pick kids

63
00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.960
up at school, you do
this, you can do that.

64
00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.120
And it's like, well, yeah,
that is part of it.

65
00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.250
But then I also have
that, maybe you've had this

66
00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.740
feeling, this remote worker, low
self esteem where it's like,

67
00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.660
they can't see me. So
they don't really know that

68
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.760
I'm doing anything. So I'll
work extra hard to make

69
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.700
sure that I produce. And
I ended up working more

70
00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.070
at night and more hours
than I did when I

71
00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.220
was in the office. There's
and there's data on that

72
00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.420
out there. There's research on
that. You know, there's a

73
00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.810
lot of anecdotal information. There's
a lot of surveys of

74
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.390
companies, you know, by companies
who are remote and, and

75
00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:17.040
a lot of them have
people report that phenomenon. But

76
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.790
my favorite example of this
is as I was working

77
00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.100
on researching this, the guide
to remote work that we

78
00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.550
put out, there's too often
cited studies that talk about

79
00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.120
the increased productivity of remote
workers that are the closest

80
00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.750
thing to actual controlled study,
not just surveys or, you

81
00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.830
know, sort of self reported,
anecdotal measures. One is a

82
00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.970
Chinese travel agency that sends
half their workforce home to

83
00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.430
do book travel bookings. And
another one is the us

84
00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.270
patent office. And so it's
patent officers who, again, same

85
00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.460
thing. They sort of did
a controlled study of patent

86
00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.100
officers working from home and
approving patents and folks doing

87
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.040
that in the office. And
both of them reported in

88
00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.100
some cases sort of magical,
you know, productivity numbers, 20%

89
00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.950
more productivity from the folks
at home. But the bit

90
00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:03.720
that got me when I
really dug in and read

91
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.190
the Chinese travel agency study
is the quote unquote productivity

92
00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.800
numbers was just that they
were actually spending almost an

93
00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.760
entire day more working collectively
aggregated over the week. They

94
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.440
weren't getting more done in
the same amount of time.

95
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.900
They were just working more
cause they Right. And that's

96
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.180
the trick. So when I
went 13 years ago to

97
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.190
work remotely, I thought, Oh,
you know, I'm going to,

98
00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:24.960
I'm going to go home.
I'm going to work maybe

99
00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.740
what, 30 hours, and then
hang out. And that's not

100
00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.230
what happens. You don't, you
could do that, but you

101
00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:34.500
always seem to find yourself
working differently like that. And,

102
00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.600
and I end up being,
I feel more productive because

103
00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.240
people aren't wandering into my
office. I'm not getting interrupted

104
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:43.470
or I'm getting interrupted differently.
And there's, there's, I, I

105
00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.380
missed the chatter. I missed
the, the water cooler. And

106
00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.090
I think that that re
know that adds me a

107
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.100
half an hour, an hour
a day. And then I

108
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.110
think another bad thing about
remote workers at home is

109
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.260
we tend not to, you
know, we eat lunch at

110
00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.470
our desks a lot. There's
not a lot of out

111
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.340
for lunch with the team,
which can burn 90 minutes

112
00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:03.790
Of the sort of care
things that are built into

113
00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:07.030
an in person, environment. You
know, so much of remote

114
00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.160
work is intense. It has
to become so much more

115
00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.740
intentional, not just how do
you communicate with people or

116
00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.170
how do you write things
down or when, and how

117
00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:16.750
do you meet? But you
have to be intentional then

118
00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:19.390
about all this. You know,
once I saw something, somebody

119
00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:22.420
was mentioning where, you know,
people are now doing something

120
00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:25.390
that staffs were doing for
them. If they went into

121
00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:28.930
an office, right office managers
and, you know, heads of

122
00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:32.200
people or culture, people, or
folks who made sure they're

123
00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.020
always snacks or whatever in
your office, you're now the

124
00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:39.850
COO of your home office.
And if you're not thinking

125
00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:44.200
about what your quote unquote
employee health is like, then,

126
00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:47.290
well, no one else is
doing it. And I had

127
00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:51.190
to get very intentional about
that myself as well. And

128
00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:53.800
I mean, I finally ended
up getting onto a really

129
00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:56.890
specific gym schedule that worked
with me and my family,

130
00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:58.420
but I would also make
sure that I would always

131
00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:00.640
carve out time to sit
at my table and eat

132
00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.310
lunch and not do any
work, take the dog for

133
00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:04.690
a walk. And I would
have to, I put these

134
00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:06.640
things on my calendar. I
mean, I scheduled a man

135
00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:09.940
and my whole team can
see what I'm doing. And

136
00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:12.760
I think that that self
care aspect is something that's

137
00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:16.720
even more important right now.
And even harder to do

138
00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:20.740
in this environment. You can
go to the gym. Some

139
00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:24.010
people can't even go outside.
And so I think those

140
00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:27.430
challenges are really exacerbated right
now. So you work for

141
00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:30.280
Holloway, it's H O L
L O w a Y.

142
00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:33.580
And this is a company
that publishes comprehensive guides, right?

143
00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:35.320
It's a world out there
where everybody can take their

144
00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.390
blog and I could take
my blog and I could

145
00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:40.030
throw it into a remote
guide for, you know, whatever

146
00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:41.680
I can make a PDF
and a couple of days.

147
00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:44.590
And that would be Scott's
guide to remote work. But

148
00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:52.030
Holloway is not that I
am looking right now@thehollowayguidetoremoteworkthatyoucanpickupatholloway.com. You've

149
00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:56.770
got a huge amount of
reviewers contributors, contributing authors. This

150
00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:59.290
looks, this is not a
blog. There's not a medium

151
00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:04.000
post. This is a 300
page research book with editorial

152
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.690
and a, an appendix. It
almost feels somewhere like close

153
00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:10.600
to the level of effort
that gets put into a,

154
00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:14.770
a Forester report. This is
you put some work into

155
00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:18.790
this. I was in links.
It did. I think the

156
00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:21.970
challenge right now about talking
to people about this guide

157
00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:23.710
is people in our, like,
yeah. Okay, I got it.

158
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:25.060
You got a guide to
remote work. That's great. I

159
00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:27.910
mean, it's the environment it's
in the tech universe at

160
00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:33.070
least, and is saturated with
discussions and material about remote

161
00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:37.060
work. But we started on
this last fall. So we

162
00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:39.640
had published some other guides
in, you know, sort of

163
00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:42.850
adjacent areas around startups and
high growth companies, things around

164
00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:47.300
venture capital or hiring and
scaling software teams. And I

165
00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:49.540
had had this, I'd had,
we had lots of topics

166
00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:50.980
we want to work on.
And I basically said, we

167
00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:55.180
should do this last, like
September, October, full gut instinct

168
00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:59.850
kind of decisions. And, and
so, yeah, we've, we've, these

169
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:02.130
things take a huge amount
of time and effort to

170
00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:03.960
do. And when we started
on this, of course, we

171
00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:07.500
had no idea what was
going to happen now, but

172
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:10.860
the goal with these guides
that we produce ourselves versus

173
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.140
other things, we are starting
to publish other people on

174
00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:15.240
our platform, but we started
with our own work. It's

175
00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.340
kind of like a reverse
Netflix. Like we did the

176
00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:19.620
fancy high end stuff first,
and then we're gonna open

177
00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:22.410
it up to everyone else.
But the premise of the

178
00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:24.720
initial premise at Holloway was
so much, there's so much

179
00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.010
knowledge in the world. And
so much of it as

180
00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:28.230
sort of locked away and
the internet doesn't really help

181
00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:31.050
you get to it. It's
either in books, which are

182
00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:36.900
largely controlled by Amazon now,
like so many things, and

183
00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:39.330
it's not easy to discover
and find things online and

184
00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:41.550
anybody who's tried to Google
something, I mean, try to

185
00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:46.710
Google coronavirus right now. There's
so much information online and

186
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:48.930
it's so hard to Wade
through and figure out and

187
00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:52.350
find what's valuable and what's
helpful. And so we thought,

188
00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:55.260
well, why don't we just
start building those things? And

189
00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.950
so the intention is to
be very rigorous and to

190
00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:01.560
be as helpful as possible.
And that means we don't

191
00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:05.850
want to present one single
person or company's perspective, especially

192
00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:09.840
for very complex kinds of
topics where there is, there

193
00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.640
is no one answer and
there certainly is no one

194
00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:14.070
way of doing things, but
there, there are a lot

195
00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:16.680
of, like you said, sort
of individual perspectives out there.

196
00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.110
And so we like to
pull those together with as

197
00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:21.930
much research as we can
find. And then, yeah, a

198
00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:25.470
lot of rigor around how
that material is presented and

199
00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:30.450
evaluated and, and reviewed. I
have an academic background, quite

200
00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:33.840
a few of us actually
at Holloway do and, and

201
00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:36.660
a research background. So I
think it sort of comes

202
00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:38.920
naturally to me, but there's
not a lot of, of,

203
00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:40.860
of material like that out
there for these kinds of

204
00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:43.260
topics. So hopefully the biggest
thing for us is to

205
00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.660
be helpful. Like our art,
one of our biggest editorial

206
00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:50.430
principles is to be helpful.
And I think having a

207
00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:53.640
very well researched material is
one of the more helpful

208
00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:55.640
things that we can do
for people. Is this a

209
00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:58.880
guide that is a, like,
sit down one on one

210
00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:01.430
remote work, one Oh one
for the remote worker, is

211
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:05.390
it for the, the C
level exec? Who's our audience

212
00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:07.490
here that we're trying to
convince them? Or are we

213
00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:09.920
trying to enable them Trying
to enable them? I can't

214
00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:14.060
convince you. I can't convince
anyone. And, and I shouldn't,

215
00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:15.950
you know, prior to what
just happened, I had a

216
00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:19.040
whole spiel about how companies
need to really examine what

217
00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:21.830
works for them, what works
for one company. And if

218
00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:23.690
it's what stage it's at,
and what it's trying to

219
00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:26.360
achieve is very different than,
you know, say like a

220
00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.190
get lab who was one
of the more well known

221
00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:32.270
all remote companies, but we've
lost that choice. Now everybody

222
00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:35.930
is doing this. So our
goal was always to enable,

223
00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:39.830
to give people information and
to tackle some of the

224
00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:42.710
harder things. I think that
for me, what happened when

225
00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:45.200
I started researching this was
there, wasn't a lot of

226
00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:49.250
information about like the really
thorny, nitty gritty stuff. There's

227
00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:51.230
plenty of things that are
about how, you know, how

228
00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:53.890
to communicate asynchronous honestly, and
how to set up your

229
00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:56.410
home office. But it's hard.
Like how do you hire

230
00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:59.110
people internationally? What are the
tax laws like? What are

231
00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:01.390
all the, you know, those
kinds of things. And so

232
00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:04.750
we, we went into all
these deep pockets of the

233
00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:07.750
topic that are largely or
less, so, you know, sort

234
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:10.240
of examined. So the audience
for this, one's pretty broad.

235
00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:14.620
I think it's useful for
sort of C level folks

236
00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:17.920
to get the landscape and
to kind of understand the

237
00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:22.660
kinds of problems that line
managers and sort of departmental,

238
00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:24.580
you know, managers and folks
are going to be dealing

239
00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:27.010
with. And also, again, like
you said, to develop some

240
00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:29.710
empathy for the individual workers
who are going to be

241
00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:32.260
in these positions. And so
there's a lot in there

242
00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.710
for managers, teams, and individuals
who are on those teams,

243
00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:38.950
I'd say that's really the
core audience that we're looking

244
00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:40.720
at. There's also, like I
said, there's some material in

245
00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:44.500
there for folks who are
sort of HR, operational, you

246
00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:46.900
know, like Holy cow, one
of the things that people

247
00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:48.910
say about remote work is
you can hire someone from

248
00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:52.150
anywhere, but that's actually not
entirely true. And it's really

249
00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:57.150
hard once you start sort
of scaling internationally, Got maybe

250
00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:01.050
20% of the Microsoft developer
division working remotely. And when

251
00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:03.360
people hear that, they're like,
Oh, that's amazing. That's fantastic.

252
00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:06.750
I'd love to work remotely
from country. Right. It's like,

253
00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:08.730
eh, you know, like, do
I pay you in that?

254
00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:10.050
Like, how do I pay?
Like even just the, how

255
00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:12.300
do I pay you, But
how do I pay you

256
00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:15.090
is, could be months of
work by the way. That's

257
00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:18.060
a book right there. Yeah.
And, and, you know, pro

258
00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:20.520
tip, it's not just PayPal
and I can't just go

259
00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:23.100
and yeah, zoom some money
over to you. So that's

260
00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:26.310
a challenge. Yeah. So we
went there, you know, so

261
00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:28.740
like with those kinds of
things, but we do have

262
00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:31.290
a bunch for people who
are individual, you know, workers

263
00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:34.170
as well. So it's, it's
a pretty broad mix. I

264
00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:36.630
think there's a lot more
for managers in there as

265
00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:41.100
well. Then I've seen more
depth for managers. You know,

266
00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:44.820
Katie Walmsley, one of the
lead authors is a veteran

267
00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:47.970
engineering manager. She works for
buffer and she's been remote

268
00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:51.270
for pretty much her whole
career. And the, you know,

269
00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:53.310
the folks that she talked
to and the insights that

270
00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:56.520
she had around managing remote
teams. There were things I

271
00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:58.620
learned from her and I've
been doing this for a

272
00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:01.770
while now. So I think,
especially the things that are

273
00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:05.070
in there for managers are
really valuable. One of the

274
00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:07.020
terms that I've used, sometimes
I'm not, I think I

275
00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:10.770
made it up was organizational
willpower. And it's my it's

276
00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:12.930
when I get frustrated with
a company and some, they

277
00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:15.480
don't do something. And I
say, why doesn't remote work

278
00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:18.240
here? It's like, well, organizational
willpower, I guess that's like

279
00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:22.560
buy in, right? You need
somebody to actually care at

280
00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:25.260
a higher level. You can't
build it. I mean, can

281
00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.840
you do it from the
ground up Remote work? No.

282
00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:30.450
Everybody tells you, you can
do things like DevOps and

283
00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:32.070
whatnot from the ground up.
And anybody who's tried to

284
00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:33.960
do, even that will tell
you how hard that is.

285
00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:39.000
Remote work to succeed requires
buy in at the highest

286
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.700
levels of a company. And
it doesn't just require buy

287
00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:45.780
in. It requires empathy and
modeling of those behaviors, The

288
00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:48.930
modeling, the modeling. That's so
important. Yeah. Yeah. And there's,

289
00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:51.560
you know, people talk about
culture. There's a reason you

290
00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:54.590
see about remote work talks
about culture because well, first

291
00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:57.140
of all, culture is important
for any company. And I

292
00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:00.050
feel like what a remote
environment situation for a company

293
00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:02.960
is, is it pushes at
all the hard spots of

294
00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:05.990
running a business and having
people have to work together.

295
00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:09.860
I feel like it finds
your weaknesses. It's like having

296
00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:11.870
two year olds. So just
all to find all the

297
00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:14.990
cracks, right. And then just
wedge it in there and

298
00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:18.890
keep pushing. Yes. I mean,
if you don't, if you

299
00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:23.450
don't spend time explicitly thinking
about your culture and whether

300
00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:27.770
it is set up to
handle the kinds of challenges

301
00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:33.440
that are remote a remote
workforce has, that's going to

302
00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:37.850
be one of your biggest
challenges I believe firmly. And

303
00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:39.980
if you don't have a
set of values that support

304
00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:45.050
that, that are like very
clearly articulated and regularly reinforced,

305
00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:49.370
then I think that's incredibly
critical for leadership for companies

306
00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:53.680
who are doing this. No
one wants to manage databases.

307
00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:57.130
If they can avoid it.
That's why Mongo DB made

308
00:15:57.130 --> 00:16:01.390
Mongo DB Atlas, a global
cloud database service that runs

309
00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:05.830
on AWS, GCP and Azure.
You can deploy a fully

310
00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:09.400
managed Mongo DB database in
minutes with just a few

311
00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:13.600
clicks or a few API
calls, Mongo DB, Atlas, automates

312
00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:17.530
deployment, automates updates, handles scaling,
and more so that you

313
00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:20.440
can focus on your application
instead of taking care of

314
00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:27.460
your database, you can get
started free@mongodb.com slash Atlas. Now,

315
00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:30.490
if you're already managing a
Mongo DB deployment, Atlas has

316
00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:34.150
a live migration service. So
you can migrate it easily

317
00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:36.880
with minimal downtime and then
get back to what matters.

318
00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:41.380
Stop managing your database and
start using Mongo DB Atlas.

319
00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:44.470
So are you saying that
if you have an unhealthy

320
00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:46.390
org and then you decide
to move people remote, you're

321
00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:48.490
just going to have a
nice, big remote, unhealthy org

322
00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:52.090
You're to, yes. You will
have a nice day. It's

323
00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:53.950
going to get worse is
what I'm going to say.

324
00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:58.570
Yeah. Interesting. So one of
the things that we've been

325
00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:01.120
dealing with is that, you
know, everyone was kicked out

326
00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:03.940
of their offices, right? So
I've been doing my thing.

327
00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:06.580
And then suddenly in a
day there was like, go

328
00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:08.740
to the office, grab your
monitor, grab your mouse and

329
00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:13.180
run. Right. And we're dealing
with a, a, not a

330
00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:16.330
very level playing field. We've
got wifi people that people

331
00:17:16.330 --> 00:17:17.740
never thought about what it
was like to be on

332
00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:19.750
wifi at home for eight
hours, Or how about their

333
00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:22.810
whole family on wifi at
home for eight hours, We

334
00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:25.900
had a very nice young
person who was, had set

335
00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:29.500
up a home office in
their, in their pantry. Yeah.

336
00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:33.550
Cause it was the only
room space. Yeah. Someone else

337
00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:37.090
had a laundry hamper, flipped
upside down and they were

338
00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:39.010
at the end of the
hallway and they just made

339
00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:42.010
the hallway, the space. Right.
All of these and not

340
00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:44.500
everyone has the space or
the privilege to go and

341
00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:46.720
make a spare bedroom. Like
I have a spare bedroom

342
00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:49.320
and that's an office and
I filled it with toys.

343
00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:51.690
You know, it's full of
Legos and crap. And the

344
00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:53.220
kids come in here, grab
the Legos and they come

345
00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:55.300
back out. But it looks
pretty cool. And I, I,

346
00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:57.950
the most important part is
I have a door. Yeah.

347
00:17:57.950 --> 00:18:00.320
So do I, I have
a dedicated office and we're

348
00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:03.620
so privileged to, we built,
we bought this house because

349
00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:05.870
I was working remote. My
husband works remote. And so

350
00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:08.090
we were able to, well,
partly I'd part of the

351
00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:11.690
thing about working remotely was
we moved someplace cheap and

352
00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:13.670
then you could afford a
house. Not everybody has that.

353
00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:15.500
I mean, you know, so
you have people who are

354
00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:18.230
living in New York city in
San Francisco and they're jammed

355
00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:20.810
in there and yeah, they
certainly don't have the luxury

356
00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:25.010
of even a separate room
and children running everywhere. Trying

357
00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:27.050
to do this in the,
in the kitchen. My wife

358
00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:28.760
always says, when I, when
the door is closed, you

359
00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:31.550
know, I'm not available. Yeah.
So when we originally started

360
00:18:31.550 --> 00:18:35.570
working remotely, I tried to
express that I'm, I'm remote.

361
00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:38.840
Like I'm, I'm away, like
consider the metaphor was I've

362
00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:42.470
gone to work and that
metaphor doesn't really work. Cause

363
00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:44.540
I am here and they
can hear me in here.

364
00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:48.530
So what do I do?
Do I say, do I

365
00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:50.900
give them access to my
calendar? Do I put a

366
00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:52.490
light outside? And like right
now I have to like,

367
00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:54.890
literally have a light outside.
That's like a smart light.

368
00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.520
Right. So I just say,
you know, set the daddy

369
00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:02.930
light to red and, and
that's working so far, but

370
00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:04.970
I, my kids are 12.
I don't know if that

371
00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:06.680
would work with a fighter.
My five year old would

372
00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:08.540
be like red light and
not mom told me open

373
00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:12.350
the door. You know, any
that's what's happened. I gave

374
00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:14.600
up, I'm not going to
lie. I just stopped. I

375
00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:16.520
was having so much stress.
I mean, and, and the

376
00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:18.350
folks I work with are,
I mean, I'm the only

377
00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:21.710
parent and they're working really
hard to support me, but,

378
00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:24.710
you know, I just, I
was, I was so stressed

379
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:26.960
out cause I was like,
you know, the kids have

380
00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:28.520
to stay out and I'm
wanting to dah, dah, dah.

381
00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:29.600
And even though I knew
in the back of my

382
00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:31.310
head, I'm always, I'm telling
people in the guide, like,

383
00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:33.710
you know, like your kids
in that's okay, let people

384
00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:36.170
see your life. And I
just thought, I was like,

385
00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:38.450
well, I got, I they're
just coming in and out

386
00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:41.540
now, even when it's my
husband and I are sort

387
00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:43.730
of divvying up trying to
have like mornings with them

388
00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:46.430
and afternoons, you know, each
of us taking half of

389
00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:48.470
the day seems to be,
what's working for our structure

390
00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:49.610
because I have an eight
and a five year old.

391
00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:52.760
And five-year-old, can't self entertain
for more than, you know,

392
00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:58.160
whatever 15 minutes. And when
I just sort of threw

393
00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:00.680
up in the boundaries and
just started letting them in

394
00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:04.340
my stress level, went down,
their stress level, went down,

395
00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:08.630
my team, got to see
even more, really what I'm

396
00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:12.140
dealing with. You know, I
had like one, the five-year-old

397
00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:13.910
came in and interrupted a
conversation. I was having with

398
00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:15.830
someone and he completely lost
his train of thought. And

399
00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:17.720
I was like, yeah, imagine
that like 10 times a

400
00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:20.480
day, buddy, This brings me
up to another topic, which

401
00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:23.510
is, I think there's a
new flavor of professionalism, right?

402
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:25.220
Yeah. If you go back
to what I was saying,

403
00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:29.000
I'm trying to create an
office professional, which I'm going

404
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.480
to recreate the office. Exactly.
And I'm hearing that that's

405
00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:36.950
wrong. I think we shouldn't.
And the more people I

406
00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:40.700
talk to, at least at
what seems like fairly healthy,

407
00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:46.430
especially largely remote companies, that's
what I'm hearing. Just, they've

408
00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:52.360
just it. And I think
that's a long road for

409
00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:54.970
a lot of the rest
of America and the world

410
00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:57.700
in some cases, depending on
how different cultures approach that.

411
00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:03.100
But for me, it's been,
it's been very freeing and

412
00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:05.920
it's, it turns out that
if I'm less stressed out

413
00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:08.860
about it, they can come
in, get a hug and

414
00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:09.820
they know they're going to
get the hug and they

415
00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:11.470
can go and we're fine.
And then I'm not like

416
00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:13.870
yelling at my children to
like get out of my

417
00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:18.520
office, you know? And the
flip side is I have

418
00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:22.060
a job that is normally
I need large chunks of

419
00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:26.140
focus, time editorial work and
software development have a lot

420
00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:28.630
of figs in common. And
one of them is that

421
00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:31.720
you have to sit and
spend time constructing and thinking

422
00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:35.800
or debugging and fixing. And
I don't have that right

423
00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:38.320
now. And a lot of
the, the advice and our

424
00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:40.390
guidance about how to do
deep work and how to

425
00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:42.370
set up your calendar and
like, you know, because we

426
00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:43.690
wrote it when we wrote
it. And now it's, now

427
00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:46.300
I don't have any advice
in there about this, but

428
00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:49.060
I think that's the biggest
challenge for people is, and

429
00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:52.540
we're having to adjust our
work styles and how much

430
00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:54.220
work we can do and
what kind of work we

431
00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:56.800
can get done. And that's
a lot to communicate with,

432
00:21:57.250 --> 00:21:59.590
you know, your teams or
your managers. And so there's,

433
00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:02.470
that's the other big shift.
I think that's going on

434
00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:06.460
aside from just trying to
work during a pandemic, a

435
00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:08.710
lot of people are finding,
especially if you have family

436
00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:12.100
around that and you don't
have, don't have a dedicated

437
00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:14.080
space or whatever, like we
were just talking about, you

438
00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:17.440
just can't necessarily plan to
sit and focus and think

439
00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:19.930
and contemplate. And so we're
having to learn how to

440
00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:22.990
work in very different ways.
But I think the new

441
00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:26.620
professionalism is that we are
humans who are in this

442
00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:31.120
unique situation together. And I
hope that breaks down some

443
00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:36.640
of the cultural expectations we
have about the office that

444
00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:40.470
are, in my opinion, just
really outdated. It seems like

445
00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:43.260
for the, you know, I've
been working for, what is

446
00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:46.440
it now? 30 years and
I've seen madman. So really

447
00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:48.300
I've been working for 60
years. So I know that,

448
00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:51.390
I know I've know how
people worked in the forties.

449
00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:54.720
Right. That's exactly what it
was like, you know, but

450
00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:57.960
it seems like finally for
the first time, and probably

451
00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:00.630
only in tech, as you
said, the tech kind of

452
00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:04.080
leads the leads, the cutting
edge here is we're recognizing

453
00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:08.610
that people are humans and
they're not resources. And if

454
00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:10.410
you're nice to them, they
will do better work than

455
00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:12.570
if you're mean to them
and burn them out. And

456
00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:15.390
now we need to take
that from privileged tech, West

457
00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:18.390
coast, to East coast, to
middle America, to the world

458
00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:22.380
and be nice to people
and let them prioritize And

459
00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:25.170
treat them with respect. You
hired them. If they're like,

460
00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:26.940
that's the thing. I think
I'm seeing a lot of

461
00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:29.820
unfortunate things out there of,
you know, sort of examples

462
00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:35.340
of, of horrible micromanagement and
expectations, which were bad enough

463
00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:38.790
if it weren't working during
pandemic and with children at

464
00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:43.830
home. But the, the office
is the office as a

465
00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:48.050
hall monitor the office, a
built in presence indicator. And

466
00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:51.200
a lot of managers have
always used that if they're

467
00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:53.630
not the kind, if I'm
just gonna come out and

468
00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:55.460
say it, if you're a
bad manager, then you're managing

469
00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:58.250
by butts and seats and
trying to, you know, control

470
00:23:58.250 --> 00:24:01.880
what people are doing daily.
And part of the nature

471
00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:04.310
of remote work, that companies
that are really have been

472
00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:06.800
doing this for awhile, it's
embracing is, is yes, hire

473
00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:11.210
people, hire smart people, enable
them, give them clear goals

474
00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:13.850
and then let them go
do their work. And you

475
00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:16.610
don't have to micromanage them.
And you don't have to

476
00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:20.380
know what they're doing every
moment of the day. Right.

477
00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:23.830
See that acknowledgement that they're
grown. Like how do you

478
00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:25.330
know that? How do you
know that they're at their

479
00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:27.940
desk? They're grown, but what
if they, what if they're

480
00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:30.490
at the mall? Well, then
I'll probably notice that their

481
00:24:30.490 --> 00:24:32.650
productivity is down and they
won't work here anymore. Like

482
00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:35.350
they are adult humans that
we hired for the job.

483
00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:37.600
We hired them to do
the job. And so if

484
00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:41.590
you didn't hire the right
people, I mean, come on,

485
00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:47.560
that's that's on you. And
so that that's, I think

486
00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:50.290
trust that trust is hard
and, and companies are gonna

487
00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:54.670
start seeing how little trust
there is. And I think

488
00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:56.740
it's easy to sit and
talk in the abstract about

489
00:24:56.740 --> 00:25:00.340
that. It's very terrifying probably
to be someone who is

490
00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:02.470
thrust into this. And you're
like, and I'm saying, sitting

491
00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:04.490
here saying like, you need
a high trust environment. And

492
00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:07.390
they're like, well, I don't,
I don't have one. And

493
00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:09.370
I don't know about you,
but I don't have a

494
00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:12.100
good answer for that right
now that you can just

495
00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:15.130
be like, tell your management
team to go build some

496
00:25:15.130 --> 00:25:18.250
trust. Like That's the thing.
And it's a constant up

497
00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:20.050
and down. It's not bottom
up. It's not top down.

498
00:25:20.050 --> 00:25:23.290
And it is modeling as
well. My like, if my

499
00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:27.400
VP is offended, when my
son jumps in my lap

500
00:25:27.850 --> 00:25:32.530
then, and feels that that's
unprofessional. But the, and, and

501
00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:34.990
then that, that isn't reciprocated
that I'm going to feel

502
00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:37.240
like, Oh, well, gosh, they're
not modeling that behavior. Therefore,

503
00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:38.680
this is not good for
me. Like it has to

504
00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:41.830
go multiple ways. Yeah. So
when I look at the

505
00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:45.370
depth of this, it is
overwhelming. You have managing distributed

506
00:25:45.370 --> 00:25:48.220
teams, being a successful remote
worker. These are the kinds

507
00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:49.990
of things that we've seen
in other guides, but then

508
00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:53.320
you go into legal tax,
operational concerns. You go deep

509
00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:57.430
into working together around communication.
One of the things that

510
00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:59.650
I was really impressed with
that I'd never even thought

511
00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:04.840
about was handling urgent issues
across remote teams. The idea

512
00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:06.670
of like, well, if I
can re I can just,

513
00:26:06.670 --> 00:26:08.170
I'll just Slack them, right.
I'll just call them on

514
00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:11.110
teams. Just like, Hey, you're
busy, you're busy. You actually

515
00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:13.780
go through creating, what's called
an incident priority matrix, which

516
00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:16.300
is the like flow chart,
the above me or not.

517
00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:19.120
Yeah, You don't have to
have that. You have to

518
00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:21.160
cause you can't see what
someone's doing. You don't necessarily

519
00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:24.400
know what's going on. And
part of the premise of

520
00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:26.410
why remote work is so
great is that we don't

521
00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:28.780
have all of these other
distractions of in an office.

522
00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:31.960
We don't have open office
plans and people tatting and

523
00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:34.480
dropping things and playing. I
mean, we have new distractions

524
00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:37.840
at home, many of which
we've already just discussed, but

525
00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:41.080
what's the point of being
able to, in theory, you

526
00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:43.440
know, turn everything off, sit
and try to get your

527
00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:47.130
work done. If somebody is
like, you know, Hey, Hey,

528
00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:49.290
are you there on Slack?
Cause then now slacks the

529
00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:53.850
new distraction technique, right. Or
teams or whatever. And so

530
00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:56.820
you like everything else with
remote work, you have to

531
00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:59.820
be explicit about how that
works. You have to talk

532
00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:02.820
to your team about it.
What a thought, how do

533
00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:06.330
we communicate? What is urgent?
If it's not urgent, when,

534
00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:08.370
when should I expect you
to get back to me?

535
00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:10.920
And then if it is
urgent, how, who, who does

536
00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:14.280
what and how? And I
just had a conversation about

537
00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:16.710
this with someone from my
team, because I got a

538
00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:19.140
migraine last week and I
Slack the team like, Hey

539
00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:21.660
guys, I got a migraine.
I don't feel great. Hey,

540
00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:23.850
y'all actually, I'm trying not
to say guys, which is

541
00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:26.160
like so frustrating when it
comes out and I gotta

542
00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:27.780
go, I gotta go lay
down for a while and

543
00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:30.000
chill out. And they're like,
okay, great. And then we

544
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.160
had a meeting on the
calendar later that day and

545
00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:35.040
they were all like, is
Courtney coming or she not

546
00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:39.330
coming? Or they didn't know.
And so in that case,

547
00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:41.220
it was, I didn't make
it seem like quite as

548
00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:42.750
serious it was. And what
I should've done was sort

549
00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:44.730
of its folks and been
like, Hey, I'm, I'm gonna

550
00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:48.000
go disappear for like three
hours because the Slack message

551
00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:51.300
just disappeared, you know, to
people, some people saw it,

552
00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:53.070
some people didn't, it wasn't
clear. And so that's like

553
00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:55.500
a perfect case of like,
what's the escalation in that

554
00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:57.900
case. And so now we're
going to have one for

555
00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:00.110
that. You know, You teach
people how to treat you.

556
00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:02.090
I've said this in my
productivity talks that like, if

557
00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:04.640
you answer email at two
in the morning or on

558
00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:07.730
a Sunday, you've taught everyone
that you do that. Right.

559
00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:10.460
So if migraines are a
thing or my diabetes shuts

560
00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:12.410
me out of a meeting
or two, because of whatever

561
00:28:12.410 --> 00:28:15.170
reasons, then I need to
think about that flow chart

562
00:28:15.170 --> 00:28:17.030
and make it as simple
as possible for both me

563
00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:19.760
and data. No, like, do
we call the police text?

564
00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:23.270
Scott's wife, he'll be there
late. Right? There's there's escalation

565
00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:26.060
there. And that's a really
important thing. And that gets

566
00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:28.400
back to the whole, we
are humans. So let's just

567
00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:31.670
be conscious of everyone's situation.
Let's just be real. You

568
00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:34.640
and I, before we got
on this podcast, I emailed

569
00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:36.530
you. And I said, I'm
having some trouble with the

570
00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:39.590
kids. It's chaos. Can I
be about five minutes late?

571
00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:42.500
And you were like, Oh
my God, I was going

572
00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:44.240
to text you the same
thing. Cause you were running

573
00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:47.180
late as well. And, and
the show still happens and

574
00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:50.570
it's still a great show.
We are. Yeah. So, but

575
00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:53.420
thank you. I think I
had joked with one of

576
00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:57.020
the, one of the lead
authors is Juan Pablo Vertica,

577
00:28:57.050 --> 00:28:59.780
who you sorta Stripe. He
was working at Stripe while,

578
00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:01.820
while he was still sort
of writing some of this

579
00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:06.110
and then he moved on
from there. But he, he

580
00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:07.700
had to write what email
is like. He had to

581
00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:10.940
write a very big cause
that's kind of how we

582
00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:13.580
do it. We don't presume
anything. Right. We try not

583
00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:18.980
to presume any specific knowledge
on anyone's part. And so

584
00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:21.200
if we're going to try
to explain what asynchronous communication

585
00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:22.850
is, we're also gonna make
sure that everybody's on the

586
00:29:22.850 --> 00:29:25.070
same page about what email
is. And so we, you

587
00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:26.870
know, so we, yeah, we'd
go down to this level

588
00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:30.800
of depth of like, here's
the really practical, like hands

589
00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:33.440
on kinds of things that
you may not have ever

590
00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:36.320
thought about. And like bringing
up email is a great

591
00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:39.380
one. And modeling of those,
we have all this explosion

592
00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:41.830
of tools we can use
now to work remotely, right?

593
00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:46.600
We have Slack and teams
and zoom and Hangouts, and

594
00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:49.390
I'm maintaining this database of,
of remote company tools. And

595
00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:51.760
every day I find like
three more. It's, it's very

596
00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:54.520
hard to keep up now
and imagine that right, as

597
00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:57.100
you're either a manager or
you're an individual person, you're

598
00:29:57.100 --> 00:30:00.760
like, how, how do I
even wrap my brain around

599
00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:03.010
which one of these I
should use? And there's a

600
00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:05.080
lot of talk about like
tools for remote work. And

601
00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:07.960
we kind of reverse engineered
that and tried to start

602
00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:10.300
from first principles, which is
how do you need to

603
00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:12.850
communicate? What do you need
to communicate about? And how

604
00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:15.880
does that differ across different
kinds of scenarios and then

605
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.240
sort of build up an
architecture of the ways you

606
00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:21.640
communicate and things you used
to do that. And then

607
00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:23.860
again, part of the sort
of communication or, you know,

608
00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:27.310
protocol matrix, write it down
that way. Everybody knows it's

609
00:30:27.310 --> 00:30:30.760
it's not, it's not unclear.
And yeah, so kudos to

610
00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:33.240
the folks who are writing
this stuff too, because it's

611
00:30:33.250 --> 00:30:34.930
not a way that you're
a lot of people are

612
00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:36.490
used to writing. You kind
of write some stuff, you

613
00:30:36.490 --> 00:30:38.110
know, and then you move
on. And I, we had

614
00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:39.460
to spend a lot of
time going, wait, what do

615
00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:41.560
we have? We have to
clarify that for people, we

616
00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:44.200
have to be very explicit.
What that means. We can't

617
00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:48.340
leave anything to be confusing
or unclear. So that's why

618
00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:50.700
it takes a while to
do these things. Well, folks

619
00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:55.290
can check out the Holloway
guide to remote work@holloway.com. That's

620
00:30:55.290 --> 00:30:58.470
H O L L O
w a Y. It is

621
00:30:58.470 --> 00:31:02.460
an extraordinary full-on book online
within a really amazing reader.

622
00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:05.460
It's online in a really
interesting piece of software. This

623
00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:08.440
is not just an infinite
scroll through 300 pages of

624
00:31:08.490 --> 00:31:10.980
stuff. And you can go
and check out all the

625
00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:14.520
links. There's almost a 900
links within it. Dozens of

626
00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:17.640
contributing authors. And it is
very highly edited and really

627
00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:19.830
extraordinary. And I appreciate that.
You all put it out

628
00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:23.670
early during these unusual times.
Yeah, that was a, I

629
00:31:23.670 --> 00:31:25.380
mean, we, like I said,
we started on this thing

630
00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:27.600
and thank you and huge
praise to our sort of

631
00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:30.780
product and engineering team who
have, have built. What I

632
00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:34.500
think is a really like
delightful reading experience online. We

633
00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:37.740
were conflicted about whether to
release it early, to put

634
00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:41.970
it out, to promote it,
but people kept coming to

635
00:31:41.970 --> 00:31:43.800
us and saying, you've got
to do this. Like this

636
00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:47.700
thing's super valuable. It actually
is helpful. It goes well

637
00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:52.140
below the surface. So I'm
continuing to fight my instincts

638
00:31:52.170 --> 00:31:53.580
with, cause I don't want
people to feel like we're

639
00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:57.300
trying to capitalize on a
crisis. No, I definitely don't.

640
00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:59.910
There are businesses that are
capitalizing on a crisis, but

641
00:31:59.910 --> 00:32:01.830
then there are ones that
are putting out useful information.

642
00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:03.600
And I think that this
is useful information and that's

643
00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:06.030
why I wanted to chat
with you. Well, thank you

644
00:32:06.030 --> 00:32:09.390
very much. I'm so excited
to finally get to connect

645
00:32:09.390 --> 00:32:12.990
with you. Alright. I've been
talking with Courtney Nash and

646
00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:15.630
this has been another episode
of Hanselminutes and we'll see

647
00:32:15.630 --> 00:32:28.200
you again. Next time. <inaudible>.
