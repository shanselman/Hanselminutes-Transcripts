00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.710
developer and technologist Scott Hanselman.
This is Lawrence Ryan announcing show

10
00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.000
number four 61. In this
episode, Scott talks with Ruby

11
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.540
language creator Matsumoto you can
hear Hi, this is Scott

12
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.940
Hanselman. This is another episode
of Hansel minutes, and I

13
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.730
am here in Japan today
at the go Azure event.

14
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.310
And I have the pleasure
of talking right now, live

15
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.280
in front of an audience
here with Matsumoto UK hero,

16
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.460
also known as mats. How
are you? Yeah. Good to

17
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.590
see you. Thank you so
much for chatting with us.

18
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.070
We have a applause. Now
this is great. I don't

19
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.970
usually have applause now. So
you are the creator of

20
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.620
the Ruby language and you
did this in 1996. I

21
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.520
started developing Ruby in 93,
and then, then I put

22
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.230
it in the opposite of
on, on 95. It's kind

23
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.230
of as old as Java.
Yeah, that is quite old.

24
00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.350
Yeah. What is, what is
happening in your mind when

25
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.110
you're thinking, you know, I
need to make a language,

26
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.480
I need to make a
better language. What were you

27
00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.880
doing in 93 that made
you make a new language?

28
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.590
Actually, the, I had been
a big fan of programming

29
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.870
language for a long time
since I was in high

30
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:11.390
school. So I studied a
lot about programming languages. Actually,

31
00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:18.320
I, I was interested in
languages rather than making software.

32
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:23.840
So whatever the purpose is,
I want it, I want,

33
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.970
I want, I wanted the
land, the, to of a

34
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.620
programming language. So after I
graduated from school and university,

35
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:37.070
dang, I became a professional
programmer. And then in 93

36
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.200
in Japan, the bubble economy
was crashed. So the economy

37
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.990
was decreased and then my
project was canceled and luckily

38
00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.620
I wasn't fired. So I
have no Saint job. I

39
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.100
have time. I have boring.
I had, I was boring

40
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.730
and I had an computer
on my desktop. So I

41
00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.280
wanted start something. Then I,
my high school dream came,

42
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.890
came back, so, okay. Let's
create a language for my

43
00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.390
own. So when I talk
to people who have made

44
00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.430
languages before, I'm a software
person who makes applications. So

45
00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.000
I always assume they're making
the app, the language for

46
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.510
an application, but when I
talk to language people, they're

47
00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.930
making the language for the
language sake, for the joy.

48
00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.020
Yes, yes. For the happiness
of making the lamb, that

49
00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.260
kind of person. So you
weren't thinking this will be

50
00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.930
a popular web language or
a scripting language. You were

51
00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.150
just thinking this would be
a great language. Yeah. You

52
00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.600
know, I learned a lot,
a lot about the programming

53
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.680
language. So I loved that
some feature of that language

54
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.980
or the other other feature
from the other language. So,

55
00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.350
so I picked up these
lovely things, put it into

56
00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.140
one in a unified design.
So that's what I wanted

57
00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:03.840
to, so, so I, I
didn't mean to create, say

58
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:10.050
web programming language that the,
just the, a programming language,

59
00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:16.470
we four of my favorite
features. Hmm. So what languages

60
00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.060
were your favorite languages that
you pulled inspiration from? And

61
00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:27.030
back then, I liked lisp,
small cock and C and

62
00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.840
a little bit of Pearl
Pearl. Really? Yeah. Yeah. It

63
00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.320
seems like you just described
some very elegant languages and

64
00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.460
then Pearl. Yeah. Yeah. Paul
is of Pretty much elegance

65
00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.570
and pragmatic. That's true. That's
true. So that's an interesting

66
00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.110
point because there's a lot
of discussion around languages around.

67
00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.900
Is this the purest language?
Is this a language for

68
00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.950
the Lambda calculus or is
this the pragmatic? Let's get

69
00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:57.300
some work done language. Yeah.
Yeah. I want to something

70
00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:01.950
in between in very good
balance. Yeah. And balance is

71
00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.680
something that people say they
feel when they are using

72
00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.250
Ruby. One of the things
that I have heard is

73
00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:13.110
that people like to write
Ruby like a haiku, have

74
00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.200
you heard this? They want
the Ruby to flow and

75
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.790
to feel right. It's a
sense of aesthetic of art.

76
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.790
I don't hear this with
other languages. You don't think

77
00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:29.730
about beautiful Java, but you
do hear beautiful Ruby. Was

78
00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:34.890
that your intent? Yes, I,
I was, I had to

79
00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:40.770
been pretty much focused on
the designing for human sake

80
00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.210
for designers or for, I
mean that Ruby users, developers.

81
00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:48.930
So, so I want as
a, you know, as a

82
00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.990
primary user of the, my,
my own programming language. So

83
00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:57.980
I wanted to amuse myself
by designing the, this programming

84
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:06.200
language suitable for me mysel
or so, but the unexpectedly

85
00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:10.820
many people all over the
world find a failed similar

86
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.870
way. So I like this
programming language. This is, this,

87
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.410
this programming language. Declarative must
be pretty beautiful in Mo

88
00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:26.900
in his own sight. So
I, I was surprised, you

89
00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.290
know, I designed like clogging
language for myself. And then

90
00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:34.450
so many people feel a
similar way. Hmm. That's interesting

91
00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:37.660
because I hear that about
artists of other kinds, you

92
00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:39.940
know, are you painting for
the public or are you

93
00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:43.060
painting for yourself? If I
write, if I make some

94
00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.760
art and I love the
art, I don't care what

95
00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:49.660
you think, but if everyone
loves it, then you've touched

96
00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:54.460
something more, kind of more
human, more deeper. It's interesting.

97
00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:57.610
Also though, that you did
this quietly for a few

98
00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:02.380
years alone. Yes. You didn't
have any one helping committee.

99
00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:08.530
So I, I told some,
All my close friends, but

100
00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:14.680
not, not, not a prophet
programmers. Right. So Ruby is

101
00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:18.240
not something that has been
designed by committee. No, at

102
00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:22.780
all. Right. So it's a
reflection of your style. And

103
00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:27.430
then it immediately, immediately become
popular when you put it

104
00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:29.890
out, you push a button
and go to sleep and

105
00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:33.610
then you wake up famous.
Yeah. Took, took long, long

106
00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:38.860
time to be become popular.
So I, so I previously

107
00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:42.700
mentioned, I started developing Ruby
in 93 and then I

108
00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:46.480
brought it in, in, on
the internet on 95, but

109
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:51.910
I don't know, five to
six years. So very few

110
00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:56.740
people knew about the programming
language. And then on the

111
00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:03.070
year 2000, the programmatic, Dave
Thomas wrote a book named,

112
00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:08.170
we named our programming Ruby,
and which is kind of

113
00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:15.400
a reference and a tutorial
combined into one book. Then

114
00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:20.500
that book introduced the Ruby
language to the non Japanese

115
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:26.620
people. So many people first
met Ruby through that book

116
00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:32.710
really? Yeah. On yeah, 2000
then a year, 2001, we

117
00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:37.780
formed a, we organized the
first Ruby conference in Tampa,

118
00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:43.270
Florida. Then every year we
had a Ruby conference. The

119
00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:47.770
first Ruby conference was 10.
The Dumbo of attendee was

120
00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:53.860
a, say 37 or something.
Very small conference, like a

121
00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:57.660
user group. I use a
group of Meetup meetup. Yeah.

122
00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:04.700
Yeah. And it was, it
was held a week before

123
00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:10.340
the ACM oops law. So
the people, some of the

124
00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:14.870
oops attendee also attended were
be conference. So we had

125
00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:20.420
a attendee from the United States,
of course, in Japan, Mexico,

126
00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:24.830
Germany, France from many countries.
But the number of only

127
00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:28.790
30 study something. And had
you been a member of

128
00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:33.020
like ACM and a kind
of a computer scientist as

129
00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:36.290
you? Yeah. I, I, I
was a member of the

130
00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:41.420
ICM, but you know, I'm
not a not Academy person,

131
00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:46.070
but I just be, I
just became a member to

132
00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:50.750
read some papers from the
ACM library. How many languages

133
00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:54.260
do you think get created
and have small 30 person

134
00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:58.070
meetups? And that's just the
end of that language. Yeah.

135
00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:02.870
That's pretty much possible. And
I, I expect that kind

136
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:07.400
of, you know, you know,
ma maybe a hundred, a

137
00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:11.420
hundred, 200 people use the
Ruby for several years and

138
00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:14.960
then get, get bored and
the moving to the other

139
00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:18.920
language, like a Python and
anything like that. And then

140
00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:24.080
the language will be glossary
disappears from the internet. That

141
00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:28.000
was what I expected at
the beginning, but that didn't

142
00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:32.390
have. Yeah. And do you
get tired of Ruby though?

143
00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:36.090
Hours later? It still makes
you happy. Yeah, it, it,

144
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:40.100
it, it, it, it was
designed to make me happy

145
00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.340
and it worked Well. So
today this is still your

146
00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:47.330
favorite language. Your language is
your favorite list. Do you

147
00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:50.540
think about the next versions
and what's happening in other

148
00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:53.240
languages right now? Cause there's
a lot of other go

149
00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:55.760
is coming up and people
are talking about other languages.

150
00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:58.850
There's a lot of excitement
around Scala Lisbeth, maybe seeing

151
00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:04.610
a bit of a resurgence.
Yeah. In recent years, the

152
00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:09.260
statically plugging language like a
scholar or say go or

153
00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:13.700
out some other language and
a functional programming language <inaudible>

154
00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:20.330
is getting more popular. And
then I, I understand the

155
00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:25.190
pros from those, those languages,
but still. So I still

156
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:31.240
love the dynamicity and flexibility
and productivity or dynamic types

157
00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:36.290
of programming language like Ruby.
So the, we a country

158
00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:42.320
working on the, something in
between like a techno through

159
00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:46.130
the technology, like a soft
piping who are gradual typing

160
00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:51.890
so that you can write
a code without any type

161
00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:56.380
of declaration. But the compiler
is smart enough to guess

162
00:11:57.190 --> 00:12:02.560
that your intention of pipes,
then the compiler can tell

163
00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:07.330
you, you, you are intention
and you can, you know,

164
00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:11.050
you can have a conversation
about types with the competitor.

165
00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:13.980
That's a really good way
to put that. I really

166
00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:18.270
liked that. Some people like
in my world is very

167
00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:23.400
much C-sharp the, the compiler
is a policeman and the

168
00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:27.450
compiler is a spellchecker. Yeah.
Yeah. And the compiler says,

169
00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:31.650
you're wrong. Stop doing that.
But you just described a

170
00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:35.910
wonderful conversation with the compiler.
Well, I think you mean

171
00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:39.120
this. What do you think?
Well, compiler, maybe this way

172
00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:42.810
by giving different annotations, you
can bend the compiler to

173
00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:45.330
your will. Yeah. Yeah. One
of my plan is that

174
00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:50.610
kind of, you know, Google
has the feature name, the

175
00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:54.660
digital means and something. So
you, if you type, if

176
00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:56.910
you made a typo or
that if you choose the

177
00:12:57.410 --> 00:13:02.310
wrong words, so the Google
suggests as the right keywords

178
00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:06.360
to search. So in, I
I'd like to implement something,

179
00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:10.260
something similar in a Ruby
error messages. So if I

180
00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:14.490
made a pipe, a typo
or some, some kind of

181
00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:18.750
mistakes, the competitor suggest me
that you did, you mean

182
00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:23.730
this that's so helpful. Yeah.
To, to, to help us

183
00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:29.100
fix the problem. That's a
very humanist approach programming. So

184
00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:33.690
I want, I want the
computer to our sovereign. So

185
00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:37.320
we w I want to
a, I want to be

186
00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:41.610
a master of my pro
I'm in computers. So I

187
00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:44.340
don't want to do, you
know, you know, get arrested

188
00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:48.780
by making mistake. The computer
works for me. Yeah, absolutely.

189
00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:51.600
I want my computer to
be like Jarvis and Tony

190
00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:55.320
stark. Yeah. Like he's so
kind and so helpful to

191
00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:58.050
me. Yeah. That's fantastic. I
really like that idea of

192
00:13:58.050 --> 00:14:01.950
a conversation with your, with
your compiler. I liked that

193
00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:05.940
you said that. So then
when did rails happen and

194
00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.850
did, did he just do
rails? And then you said,

195
00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:12.090
Hey, what's going on over
there? Or did he DHH

196
00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:15.840
approached you? How did that
happen? You know, wherever this

197
00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:21.990
was started 10 years ago,
2004. And then it was,

198
00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:25.470
it became popular as soon
after that. And then so

199
00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:29.970
many people found Ruby through
rails. So rails is so

200
00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:35.070
popular and building up the
websites using rails that means

201
00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:39.930
programming in Ruby so that
people learn, found and learned

202
00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:45.240
Ruby through rails. And then
this, that became a basis

203
00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:50.340
of the Ruby's popular reality
right now, Hey, this is

204
00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:53.120
Scott. You know, I like
a good community edition. The

205
00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:55.760
best things in life are
free. And the community license

206
00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:59.300
from our sponsors sync fusion
will give individual and small

207
00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:03.500
business developers access to more
than 650 components across 12

208
00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:08.480
platforms. And that includes WPF
windows forms, JavaScript, Xamarin, Lightswitch.

209
00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:13.460
You can check it all
out at sync, fusion.com/hanselman to

210
00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:19.340
claim your free license. Did
that new use case change

211
00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:22.880
your perspective or were you
already thinking web when you

212
00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:28.030
started? We are thinking, thinking
where before that, so rails

213
00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:31.390
is not the first web
application framework for Ruby. So

214
00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:37.300
we had several of them
ESP before, but rails is

215
00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:42.130
most productive and really became
most popular. And how do

216
00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:50.170
their needs and use cases
influence you? Probably the rails

217
00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:56.800
put, put the productivity and
the flexibility in the first

218
00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:02.260
priority of Debra first that
is very different from others

219
00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:06.550
back then. So the, you
know, we had the say

220
00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:11.410
web application framework for Java,
but the, we have had

221
00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:15.070
to write ponds of XML
Cole to, to implement the

222
00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:20.110
flexibility. So that back then
the XML is the scripting

223
00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:24.370
language. Yes, yes. I remember.
It's not easy to read.

224
00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:28.780
It's not easy. Right. And
it seems also that a

225
00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:31.060
number of people have used
Ruby to make their own

226
00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:34.390
domain specific languages. It was
so flexible that they made

227
00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:37.570
their own. Yeah. Yeah. Do
you, do you interact with

228
00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:40.810
those? Are there any particular
domain specific languages in Ruby?

229
00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:45.940
You know, I think rails
itself is a web domain

230
00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:50.560
specific language to do web
dev DSL and a Sinatra

231
00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:58.900
extended a step further. So
the, I, I encourage people

232
00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:03.790
to use Ruby as a
basis of DSL, just know,

233
00:17:04.090 --> 00:17:09.700
by using a DSL approach,
you, the programmers, or even

234
00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:14.920
non-programmers can be more productive
and more flexible and application

235
00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:18.940
will be programmer programmable. So
this is good thing Is

236
00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:22.690
a very good thing. It
makes people happy when someone

237
00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:27.550
is creating a language specification,
sometimes they will discover gaps

238
00:17:27.850 --> 00:17:31.270
in that specification where someone
will use the language in

239
00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:34.660
a way that the compiler
didn't expect. Well, Ruby was

240
00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:38.530
coming up and gaining a
lot of use. Did anyone

241
00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:43.300
find interesting use is where
they wrote something in Ruby

242
00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:46.750
that you didn't think about
that it confused the compiler

243
00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:52.590
in an interesting way and
change the language? I know

244
00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:55.520
that's a hard question. Yeah.
That's a good question though.

245
00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:58.960
And the rails comes up
with the label already named

246
00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:04.640
active support, which is enhanced
language. So by the, that,

247
00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:09.440
that rivalry adds pans of
master to the existing classes.

248
00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:14.990
And then, so you can
say, for example, two days

249
00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:20.340
ago to get the time
of the 48 hours prior

250
00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:24.530
or something like that. And
that is, that is quite

251
00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:30.770
interesting approach. Many people don't
expect to extend the existing

252
00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:37.890
class, but I allow that,
but for on purpose, but

253
00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:44.720
the rails people extend that
step a few steps farther

254
00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:47.990
than I expected. Yeah. And
I think I know when

255
00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:51.170
I saw active support for
the first time and typed

256
00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:56.000
two dot days ago, I
just, it felt strange because

257
00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.260
it was so fluent from
an English speakers perspective that

258
00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:04.520
it almost seemed like magic.
Yeah. And I wonder if

259
00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:06.860
you had thought about that
fluency, that idea of the

260
00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:10.550
fluent interface before, and I
feel like maybe active support

261
00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:14.150
and Ruby's flexibility inspired a
new generation to create these

262
00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:19.580
fluent interfaces. We have the
test tribal in our spec,

263
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:26.630
which is quite the similar
to English sentence and, you

264
00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:32.630
know, as a non English
speaker. So it's, it makes

265
00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:38.390
me feel some somewhat weird
or two mats. But I,

266
00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:44.000
at the same time, I,
I, I feel honor to

267
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:49.130
be a author of that
kind of forgiving language. Abusable

268
00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:53.180
Changing topics a little bit.
One of the things that,

269
00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:57.470
that I admire about you
is this, this funny concept

270
00:19:57.470 --> 00:20:00.920
of men Swan, this one,
I mean, Swan mats is

271
00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:05.300
nice. So we are nice.
Did you consciously try to

272
00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:10.550
foster a positive community of
helpers or are you just

273
00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:15.050
nice? And it just happened.
The, the, the term is

274
00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:18.050
one self is not coming
from me. Of course not

275
00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:23.420
from a, of course now
it's from, is for Marty

276
00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:26.360
follower. He said, he said
means that means one for

277
00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:31.940
the first time. And, but
I I'm sick of the

278
00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:36.770
a hundred trolls in the
community. So, but in the

279
00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:43.280
very early stage of the,
the Ruby community, we, we

280
00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:47.090
are on the mailing lists
so that sometimes the very

281
00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:54.760
ignorant people or arrogant people
come come, came and complains.

282
00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:59.680
And the trolling and the
some, you know, it's quite

283
00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:02.710
difficult for me in only
English speaker to handle the

284
00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:10.240
situation. But then some, some
other guys became, became too

285
00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:14.710
to what what'd I say,
knowledge pit paste, fight here

286
00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:18.310
to, okay, this is not
the place to complain. This

287
00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:22.570
is the place to, for
us to discuss or the

288
00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:29.200
make the constructive discussion. Right.
So the, he helped us

289
00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:33.060
to be, eh, to be
nice each other. Right. They

290
00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:37.920
set the tone yeah. Room.
Yeah. The atmosphere, the atmosphere.

291
00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:41.130
So I, I really to
be able to elect them.

292
00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:45.870
And so, as a, as
a member of a community,

293
00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:49.440
I try to be nice
to my many people. The,

294
00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:55.850
the, the, the original atmosphere
was actually driven by the,

295
00:21:55.850 --> 00:22:02.010
these guys in the alley
community. I, I followed him

296
00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:06.630
there actually. So really it's
the early community members decided

297
00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:09.780
let's change the tone. That's
not be trolls. Let's not

298
00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:13.410
be arrogant. Let's be supportive.
Yeah. Yeah. So the, you

299
00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:19.170
know, I like the term
means Swan. So the, actually

300
00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:23.880
the, the, the Ali member
of the community, the whole

301
00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:29.280
member of the community, the
design, the atmosphere, Tom of

302
00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:32.040
the community. Yeah. That's great.
And that's something that everyone

303
00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:34.800
should feel proud of, because
I think that if, if

304
00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:37.440
people say one thing about
Ruby, they would say that

305
00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:40.320
the community is welcoming. And
we hear this a lot

306
00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:43.740
when newbies are starting out,
they find Ruby and the

307
00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:46.170
community to be very, very
kind and very helpful. Yeah.

308
00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:50.310
Yeah, absolutely. So you're working
on a, you work on

309
00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:52.830
Ruby on a regular basis,
or do you, do you

310
00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:55.170
think it will ever be
done? Would you ever put

311
00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:57.060
it aside and say, I
think I'm done for a

312
00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:59.010
year and I'm going to
do other things and then

313
00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:01.320
come back or do you
think you'll always be improving

314
00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:06.660
As I, I no longer
work as a programmer for

315
00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:09.720
the C Rudy. So I
have the full time core

316
00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:13.860
committers hired by Heroku, and
then two other guys are

317
00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:17.520
working pretty much pretty well.
So as a, so as

318
00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:20.100
a programmer, I don't have
to work on see Ruby

319
00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:24.630
no longer, but as a
designer, I still working on

320
00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:29.670
full time. So the, I,
the many design choices are

321
00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:33.720
waiting for my, my decision.
So I make decisions to

322
00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:40.590
do the fall, decide the
direction to the language follows.

323
00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:43.800
And then at the S
as a, an a at

324
00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:46.760
the same time, you know,
I'm a kind of time

325
00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:51.500
sliced. So I sometimes work
on the alternative Ruby implementation

326
00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:54.740
named Emma Ruby. So I'm
working on that. And then

327
00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:59.990
I recently, I'm working on
the, some other programming language

328
00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:03.400
named the stream. Is this
a hobby, or is this

329
00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:06.310
for the next day? It's
not the next day Next

330
00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:09.580
week? No, not just, just
a hobby and a prototype.

331
00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:13.570
And when you're designing these
things, do you, is it

332
00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:16.720
primarily just you thinking about
a feature that would make

333
00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:18.880
you happy, or do you
feel now the pressure of

334
00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:22.270
all the other users of
Ruby, because it was you

335
00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:25.290
in a room alone, making
yourself happy with your, your,

336
00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:29.830
your, your toy. But now
you have this community, this

337
00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:33.610
rich community around you, Since
we have the, I don't

338
00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:37.450
know, actually the literary millions
of users all over the

339
00:24:37.450 --> 00:24:43.300
world. So the, the it's,
we have to be very,

340
00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:49.090
very careful about that, not
to break anything. So the

341
00:24:49.090 --> 00:24:52.870
compatibility is our first priority.
It is as a language.

342
00:24:52.930 --> 00:25:00.400
So we have recently we
have many proposals and issues

343
00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:05.290
of the ideas to change
the language better. So we

344
00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:10.750
examine the, those ideas. So
we, if we keep the

345
00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:16.150
compatibility, if we make, if,
make this change, make the

346
00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:21.910
language better or not, or
if this change is alongside

347
00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:28.030
the follow, the philosophy behind
the Ruby language or something.

348
00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:33.280
So after these investigation and
the very serious consideration, we

349
00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:37.090
pick sub something, pick some
of them, and then we

350
00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:40.960
reject any many of them.
Has there been any thought

351
00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:43.120
or do you, what do
you think about Ruby as

352
00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:46.600
a possible replacement for JavaScript?
Because we hear people who

353
00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:50.170
both love, JavaScript and hate
it, and they feel like,

354
00:25:50.170 --> 00:25:53.020
you know, it's the worst
language ever, but it's the

355
00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:56.500
only one we have because
there's such browser support. Why

356
00:25:56.500 --> 00:26:01.090
didn't Ruby become the scripting
language for the browser? You

357
00:26:01.090 --> 00:26:06.100
know, the decision is up
to the browser creators, like

358
00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:09.730
a soul, the Mozilla company,
or the Google and the

359
00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:15.580
Microsoft, all these big players
have to bake a doc

360
00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:20.440
kind of big decision. And
at the, at the currency,

361
00:26:20.530 --> 00:26:24.400
under the current situation, it's
nearly impossible. Yeah. It's never

362
00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:26.320
going to happen. This is
the language we have. Yeah.

363
00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:29.950
It's quite difficult to make
these three or four big

364
00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:33.040
players to make that kind
of the big change or

365
00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:37.000
that big compromise. What other
languages are you excited about

366
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.980
right now? Do you see
a new language and you

367
00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:40.870
play with it and try
it out and see how

368
00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:46.560
it feels? Oh, recently I
studied about a goal from

369
00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:50.220
Google and a Swift from
Apple, and it is too

370
00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:53.100
long, was a pretty interesting
thing in the different aspect

371
00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:56.220
from this parent from different
aspect. And at the same

372
00:26:56.220 --> 00:27:02.820
time, I'm interested in language
like C a closure and

373
00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:08.120
a scholar language influence from
the functional programming language. I

374
00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:10.310
read an article yesterday that
said that Swift is one

375
00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:14.210
of the fastest growing languages.
I think the interesting thing

376
00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:16.610
is that it's not, is
it the language and its

377
00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:20.570
design and its style that
is driving that? Or is

378
00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:23.270
it the promise of the
app store and making big

379
00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:27.290
money? Yeah. So it's interesting
to see what drives the

380
00:27:27.290 --> 00:27:30.740
growth of a language. Like
first it was Ruby and

381
00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:33.470
that it made people happy
and then it was rails

382
00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:36.290
and it made people productive.
And then now we have

383
00:27:36.290 --> 00:27:39.710
app stores where it can
make people money, but it

384
00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:42.860
still seems like you really
enjoy the, just the making

385
00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:49.190
of the language and using
the language. Yeah. You know,

386
00:27:49.410 --> 00:27:52.910
the ply, my motivation, different
from people to people, they

387
00:27:52.910 --> 00:27:57.890
were positive developers, but at
the same time, I believe

388
00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:05.570
the motivation needs to be
driven by, you know, joy

389
00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:09.920
or internal satisfaction. So the
premium joy is one of

390
00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:14.870
the very basic ingredient of
the motivation program program as

391
00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:19.120
motivation. Yeah. I totally agree.
I think that, and I've

392
00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:22.280
said this to my folks
at Microsoft that, you know,

393
00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:25.370
does this, we use the
word delight sometimes too much,

394
00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:28.250
but does this really make
them happy? Does this, whether

395
00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:30.470
it be this button or
this keyword or this feature,

396
00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:33.170
I want people to have
that joy of a child

397
00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:36.230
just going, I made this,
I made this, I saw

398
00:28:36.650 --> 00:28:40.520
someone on this code, newbies,
this is a chat code.

399
00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:44.870
Nummies code newbies was talking
about that feeling that you

400
00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:47.870
get when you get your
first rails app. Hello world.

401
00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:55.190
Yeah. That's a great joy.
And actually I still same

402
00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:58.940
way in my daily plumbing.
So I did it. Isn't

403
00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:01.100
that funny? That makes me
happy. Something that makes me

404
00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:04.700
very, very poppy. Yeah. I
work from home, so I

405
00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:07.520
don't have an office, but
just a few weeks ago

406
00:29:07.550 --> 00:29:11.480
I accomplished something. I didn't
think I could. And I

407
00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:14.270
stood up in my chair
and I looked around and

408
00:29:14.270 --> 00:29:18.260
there was nobody really there
to cheer me, but I,

409
00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:19.730
and I tried to tell
my wife and she didn't

410
00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:26.270
care. Yeah. That happens. But
yeah. That's okay. Well, thank

411
00:29:26.270 --> 00:29:28.670
you so much for talking
with me. Thank you so

412
00:29:28.670 --> 00:29:31.820
wonderful. This has been another
episode of Hanselminutes and we'll

413
00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:32.990
see you again next week.
