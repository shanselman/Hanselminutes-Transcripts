G U n.com. Hi, this

11
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.380
is Scott Hanselman. This is
another episode of Hansel minutes

12
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.010
today. I'm talking with Amy Daniel.
Dansby double D how are

13
00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.820
you? I am amazing. You
are amazing. And I have

14
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.390
been enjoying watching you on
TV with my kids. And

15
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.610
I was literally just sitting
down. We had been talking

16
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.180
about watching Lego masters on
Fox. We've seen the ads,

17
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.460
we recorded it, and then
we're watching it. I'm like,

18
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.090
wait a second. I know
her. And then my friends

19
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.870
now think I'm famous because
I am peripherally connected to

20
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.440
you on Twitter. And now
I'm like, you know, one

21
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.380
Kevin bacon away from a
famous person. The internet connects

22
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.610
us or Lego connects us.
Yeah, well, absolutely. Cause you

23
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.430
know, I've got, I felt
like the entire, like three

24
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.430
Billy shelves from Ikea filled
with Lego crap at behind

25
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.530
me. I'm sure you have
like entire rooms dedicated to

26
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.080
this stuff. Oh, it's it's
my house. I love it.

27
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.330
When people come over, they'll
ask me how many kids

28
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.820
do you have? I have,
I have none. I have

29
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.920
no kids. And don't touch
this stuff on the third

30
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.290
shelf. What is the a,
isn't there an acronym for

31
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.170
that adult? Friends of Lego.
Yeah, It's a Apple. It's

32
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.020
an adult fan of Lego.
Yeah. Yeah. Why is there

33
00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.180
still a stigma? Like why
is it not okay. It

34
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.800
seems like, you know, you
ever go to like a

35
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.660
garage sale or whatever, and
you find like a cache

36
00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.120
of Legos where like a
child has gone to college

37
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.640
and then you've come upon
their remainders and you're like,

38
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.100
Oh yeah, Jackpot. Yeah. It's
a, it's interesting. Especially I

39
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.800
remember asking my dad, I'm
like, we're Lego always so

40
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.500
expensive as a kid. He's
like, yes, you just didn't

41
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.590
have to pay for them.
So they call it sometimes

42
00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.690
like the dark days. So
when you're a child, you

43
00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.670
played with Lego and then
you go off to college

44
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.410
and you're a poor college
kid and you don't play

45
00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.080
with Lego. And then when
you get a job, you're

46
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.430
like, Hmm, I'm missing something.
Some type of tinkering building

47
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.740
therapeutic. I was homeschooled though.
So we always had Lego.

48
00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.730
My mom used them for
everything from engineering, science, little

49
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.020
history lessons. Thankfully we didn't
live in a digital age

50
00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.670
where there was much embarrassing
footage. There is some, So,

51
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.250
so they integrated Lego into
your everyday life. It's like,

52
00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.500
okay, we need stuff to
build, to go and make

53
00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.310
some physics lessons for today
in our homeschool. Then they

54
00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.790
just use Lego. We would
use it for like bridge

55
00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:09.900
challenges. Just basic anything to
explain. I very much understand

56
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.360
when you put something in
front of you and you

57
00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.470
take it apart, having that
physical to explain, worked really

58
00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.440
well for us, especially for,
you know, my mom homeschooled

59
00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.760
me and my brothers. So
I'm sure it was not

60
00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.300
the easiest for her as
well. You know, there's a,

61
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.490
there's a lot of people
who say that learning styles

62
00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:32.280
has been debunked. There's people
who say that their learning

63
00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.500
styles aren't a thing. But
I, I disagree. Like I

64
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.570
think it is a thing.
If you, I think that

65
00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.720
there are tactile learners and
auditory learners and you know,

66
00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.610
people who learn by seeing
and people who learn by

67
00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.400
doing, do you think that
you became a maker and

68
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.460
you became a software engineer
because of the, do you

69
00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.800
think you were wired that
way to come to start

70
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.750
or do you think it
was the early tactile work

71
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.030
with Legos and things like
that? I don't know if

72
00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.420
I actually even understood that
until I went to college

73
00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.180
and I remember I had
a professor and he used

74
00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.950
to tell me, he's like,
if you can't explain it

75
00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.950
to a five-year-old, you don't
understand it well enough yourself.

76
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.590
And I was like, okay,
that kind of makes sense.

77
00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.520
And I remember him asking
me, what did I really

78
00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.050
do as a kid? And
I'm like, Oh, whenever I

79
00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.840
would get new stuff, I
would take it apart. And

80
00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.630
I don't think I ever
realized that was like an

81
00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.600
engineering mentality of, Oh, how
does it work this way?

82
00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.420
Why does it work this
way? I'm probably until I

83
00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.730
got older and cause to
me, since I was homeschooled,

84
00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.970
I was really never around
any other kids til I

85
00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.050
was like 16, 17. So
that was completely normal to

86
00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.800
me. Oh. And I have
to apologize to our international

87
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.140
friends at anyone who has
a legitimate Lego person that

88
00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:44.040
I sometimes have a light
slight S at the end

89
00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.770
of my leg, and I
know it's wrong. I I'm

90
00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.200
working on it. It's a
thing I'm working through. But

91
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.110
I do sometimes fall into
the Americanism of saying LIGO,

92
00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:55.530
plural, but I apologize to
our friends at Lego masters

93
00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.740
on Fox. So we used
to say, what's the plural

94
00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:06.480
of Jedi January. Alright. So
that's a good way to

95
00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.400
always remember. That's what we
used to tell a will

96
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.610
or net onset. We're like,
what's the plural of Jedi.

97
00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.510
He's like Jedi, we're like
just Lego. Yeah. It gets

98
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.490
you into the whole like
attorneys general, but then is

99
00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.970
it like, is it Jedi
master or Jetta? Yeah, that

100
00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:22.770
was like, when the movie
came out, everyone's like, Oh,

101
00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.620
the last Jedi, but they're
like, is it Jedi plural?

102
00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.350
Or is it Yeah. Is
it just, this is just

103
00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:29.940
him or is it like
a whole bunch of people?

104
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.560
This is, these are the
questions that we have to

105
00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.360
ask ourselves. So you started
out in game programming and

106
00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.380
simulation and worked at Marvel
studios, worked on games. Yes.

107
00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.280
So my actual, I guess
college degree is in a

108
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.960
game simulation and I was
the very first female intern

109
00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.940
Marvel ever hired. And right
when games I started right

110
00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.770
after the iron man phase.
So I worked on America.

111
00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:00.530
I worked on four, worked
on some of the superhero

112
00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:03.350
squad show games. I worked
on a lot of the

113
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:08.210
simulation for Thor's Cape in
the game. So at the

114
00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:14.210
time physics rendering is very
computationally expensive. And that was

115
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.340
something that really hadn't been
done before. A lot of

116
00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.250
games. Let's see, I'm trying
to think. I think the

117
00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.560
Jurassic park game was one
of the first ones to

118
00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.130
implement ragdoll physics, which is
when you would shoot one

119
00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:30.140
of the dinosaurs. This dinosaur
would fall naturally. And I

120
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:31.880
just remember when that game
came out, even though it

121
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.840
was so terrible that just
the physics in that was

122
00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.370
so advanced and something, when
you watch a, like a

123
00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.950
pre recorded cartoon or animation,
all of that stuff is

124
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:46.100
pre-rendered. But in a game,
if you are moving your

125
00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.310
character around left right up
and down, and there's any

126
00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:54.680
fabric or cloth simulation, that
stuff is computationally expensive to

127
00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.280
render in real time. So
that was something I was

128
00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.430
very proud of. And I
still do simulation. I'm still

129
00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:06.730
a software developer, but yeah,
it's evolved. Could you, could

130
00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:08.320
you dig into the definition
a little bit more? Cause

131
00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.960
I don't think that never
necessarily everyone who is listening

132
00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:14.110
knows the difference. Like everyone
understands what game programming is,

133
00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:18.460
but games simulation that is
simulating objects in, in, within

134
00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:22.720
a game. Yeah. So I
guess simulation really is. So

135
00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.460
I did a lot of
physics, a lot of physics

136
00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:29.620
on primarily cloth simulation in
games and sometimes movies and

137
00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:32.530
films do that as well,
but it's still game programming.

138
00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:37.450
So graphics programming, direct ex
you know, when we were

139
00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:42.700
in college, unity and unreal,
unity was not out. I

140
00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:45.160
think in real unreal heads
just started to come out

141
00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:47.440
and all of those are
engines. So a lot of

142
00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:50.470
things are done for you.
So for example, I used

143
00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:53.500
to ask a lot of
like my students, when I

144
00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.270
would teach classes after I
said, do you know what

145
00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:58.390
gravity is on earth? And
they're like, no, why do

146
00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:00.130
we need to know that?
And I'm like, well, it's

147
00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:03.070
9.8 and they don't have
to know that. Cause that's

148
00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:05.410
built into like the unity
engine now. Right. So it's

149
00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:08.680
just on a slider scale,
but we used to have

150
00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:12.730
to calculate if your character
is jumping, you know, there's

151
00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:14.590
some type of physics that
has to be applied if

152
00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:16.360
you're jumping on earth. So
we used to have to

153
00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:20.980
apply, you know, physics and
simulation to not only the

154
00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:25.060
characters, but to cloth Andrew's
thing. So then you can

155
00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:27.940
do that. One can do
that now in unity or

156
00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:30.340
unreal in a, in a
plugin kind of a sentence.

157
00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:32.020
Like it's what I've done.
Yeah. It's built in. It's

158
00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:37.570
amazing. It's yeah. It's like,
it's not fair. Isn't that

159
00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:39.130
funny how it is. Like
I, you know, I do

160
00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:42.130
work in C-sharp primarily and
in managed languages and you

161
00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:44.590
know, sometimes you will come
upon a person who, you

162
00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:47.980
know, never managed their own
memory. And then you're like,

163
00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:50.110
then you become old person
who shakes your fist at

164
00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:52.600
the cloud and you go,
when I was a child,

165
00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:55.530
we managed our own memory.
We managed our own cloth

166
00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:58.070
simulation. You kids with your
plugins. Yeah. What do you

167
00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:01.790
mean I have to dump
and have garbage collection. So

168
00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.610
Would, would the looking at
Thor's Cape for a second,

169
00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:09.110
would the cloth itself be
simulated using calculations in real

170
00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:12.560
time? Or would you calculate?
Yeah. Yes. Yes. So it's

171
00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.870
not like, think about it
when you watch like a

172
00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:17.660
TV show on Netflix, it
can buffer and get ahead,

173
00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:21.080
but in a game it
doesn't buffer or get ahead

174
00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.870
like that. So it was
kind of broken up into

175
00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:26.810
polygons. So for example, there
would be say you have

176
00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:30.920
a square, each corner would
be one polygon. So four

177
00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:34.790
polygons for one square. And
I believe Thor's Cape was

178
00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:40.820
around 50,000 polygon points. Yeah.
So each one of those

179
00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:44.660
is tied to each other
and whatever gravity is applied,

180
00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:46.370
or if you're running around
in the game and you're

181
00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:50.420
turning left, you know, you
would expect that this cake

182
00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:53.870
is going to flow and
fall with you naturally. Wow.

183
00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:56.060
Now, would you have to
work with the, as the,

184
00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:57.800
as the game simulator, would
you work with like the

185
00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:01.070
creative director and you're like,
yeah, 50,000 triangles. That's how

186
00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:02.780
many we need. And they're
like, no, like we only

187
00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:05.210
have 10,000. You have to
like go and fight with

188
00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:07.550
them about the Cape. Won't
look good if you don't

189
00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:10.130
give me this much computational
power. And they're like, no,

190
00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:11.450
we have, we need them.
We need it for the

191
00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:15.200
explosions. No, I mean, this
was also one of the,

192
00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.140
this was like the second
or the third game, really

193
00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:19.880
that come to come out
of Marvel studios at the

194
00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:24.740
time. And I mean, some
of those discussions were had

195
00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:28.250
also, it was a little
different. So, you know, console

196
00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:31.310
for like Xbox and PlayStation
was very different than if

197
00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:36.140
the game was on. We,
so, you know, different, you

198
00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:40.550
know, developer for some of
that stuff at the time,

199
00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:43.760
it was kind of like
the wild West. So whatever

200
00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:47.180
they say goes, but also
for, for not everything took

201
00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:51.320
place on mid guard, which
is earth. So that was

202
00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:53.870
some fun experimenting as well.
Did you actually change the

203
00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:56.480
way the cloth behaves differently?
Yes. So that's why, that's

204
00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:59.390
why I said, I know
what, what the physics is

205
00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:04.370
on earth, right. Because of
gravity and you know, the

206
00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:08.660
unity didn't exist at the
time. How do we get

207
00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:11.810
people to care about that
stuff? Like I just realizing

208
00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:14.270
that just then I was
just like, ah, you're right.

209
00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:17.240
The Cape would be different
on different planets. That's so

210
00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:18.800
cool. And then it feels
like there's kind of two

211
00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.870
kinds of people in the
world. There's people who would

212
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:23.000
find that incredibly awesome. And
then there's people who are

213
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.610
like, Yeah. So that's, that's
not my problem. My problem

214
00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:32.450
is I, I want to
know everything and yeah. How

215
00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:34.670
do you, how do you
get people to care about

216
00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:39.110
stuff like that? Sometimes it's
finding an application that they're

217
00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:42.230
used to, like that they're
interested in. So I have

218
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:44.120
a little brother and one
of their classes, I know

219
00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.040
they were, they all had
to make a web page,

220
00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:48.590
but it had to be
this cooking webpage. So they

221
00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:51.200
had this template and he's
like, this class is boring.

222
00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:52.850
And I'm like, well, of
course you don't care about

223
00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:55.930
cooking and you're making this,
you know, you have nothing

224
00:11:56.590 --> 00:12:00.370
that, you know, I'm trying
to think of it. Yeah.

225
00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:04.090
So like he really likes,
he really likes baseball. So

226
00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:06.460
if he could find some
way to like, you know,

227
00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:11.170
make this webpage interactive or
about baseball, the, the learning

228
00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:16.030
application is so much different.
I feel that's how I

229
00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:19.060
find like the best drive.
I always talk about just

230
00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:21.430
any of the projects I
work on is I call

231
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:24.220
them like, especially I work
on a lot of costume

232
00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:27.850
stuff, just, I call it
the gateway drug. It starts

233
00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:30.910
with cardboard and it evolves
to making your own printed

234
00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:35.860
circuit boards it's Hey, you
know, so my thing is

235
00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:39.580
about like fandoms, like finding
some type of something that

236
00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:41.800
you love and you obsess
about whether it's reading a

237
00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:45.460
book or watching a movie
or listening to a podcast,

238
00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:50.350
just something that you can't
stop thinking about. But yeah,

239
00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:51.820
I guess this is the
ultimate question of how to

240
00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:56.590
get people involved or to
care about, you know, things

241
00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:59.440
like that, where it's built
into an engine now, and

242
00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:03.940
they don't have to care
about physics and it's pre-calculated,

243
00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:06.430
but also in some way,
it's, it's nice because now

244
00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:09.100
I can evolve and I
can make more applications. I

245
00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:11.140
can do more in a
game and I don't have

246
00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:14.890
to spend, you know, six
months working on a physics

247
00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:19.890
engine to calculate gravity. Yeah.
The fandom is when I

248
00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:21.630
think about you and the
work that you do online,

249
00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:23.100
whether it be in the
maker community and the tech

250
00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:26.190
community and the learning and
STEM community, or watching you

251
00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:29.280
make some of your famous
cause plays, is that you

252
00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:31.470
really like the fandom. And
like, you want to create

253
00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:34.110
more fans because if people
are excited about something, if

254
00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:37.620
you're just amped or geeked
about something, then you're going

255
00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:40.530
to want to steep yourself
in it. You're wanting to

256
00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:42.240
build stuff around it. You're
going to want to make

257
00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:44.910
things that enhance the fan
experience. And I'm hoping to

258
00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:48.000
make my kids fans as
well, of whatever they're interested

259
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.640
in, whatever that thing is,
like, get all in and

260
00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:53.670
be geeked about it. Yeah.
It's very interesting in some

261
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:56.580
way, we're do cosplay, which
is, you know, dressing as

262
00:13:56.580 --> 00:14:00.180
a character or some type
of fandom dressing as another

263
00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:04.380
character. You somehow find yourself.
And I know that sounds

264
00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:07.410
probably like the opposite of
what people would think, but

265
00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:10.650
it really is. You learn,
you learn new skills, you

266
00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:13.470
learn how to put, you
know, work with physical materials.

267
00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:16.140
You learn how to do
electronics. You learn how to

268
00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:19.800
budget your time, which is
actually something time management is

269
00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:24.420
always something that I've struggled
with. And just in my

270
00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:28.860
real, like real life, my
jobs, my costumes, and you

271
00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:33.780
learn, I mean, great lessons
about, you know, not micromanaging,

272
00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:36.390
but you know, if you
have a full armor costume,

273
00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:38.370
so they, for example, we're
going to work on for

274
00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:41.100
you would, I would break
that down by, you know,

275
00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:44.940
helmet, prop, cloth, all of
that. And then, you know,

276
00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:49.380
go from there. It's interesting.
The breaking down of things

277
00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:51.530
in a S in any
system, I've a number of

278
00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:54.230
podcasts on the idea of
systems thinking that we're, you

279
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:56.270
know, we're out there trying
to teach kids how to

280
00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:58.940
code, but we're not really
teaching them how to think

281
00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:00.710
and how to break things
down. So like using your

282
00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:04.700
costume example, you break things
down into like individual functions

283
00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:06.260
and it's like, okay, I'm
going to need cloth. And

284
00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.000
I'm need to understand how
to show to do this.

285
00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:09.920
And I'm gonna need to
understand how to three D

286
00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:12.200
print to do that and
break things down into the

287
00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:15.800
individual skills that are required
for the larger whole solution.

288
00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:19.180
Did you ever have the
peanut butter and jelly example

289
00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:24.790
I've ever heard that? No.
So I gave a class,

290
00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:26.380
we did a thing for
an hour for the hour

291
00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:28.090
of code that they do
in a lot of schools.

292
00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:31.450
And we went in and
were like, all right, all

293
00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:34.060
these kids, you guys are
gonna be the programmers and

294
00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:35.560
I'm going to be the
computer. And you're going to

295
00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:39.610
pretend I know nothing, except
for the instructions you give

296
00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:42.520
me. And they're in English.
And so you have a

297
00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:44.620
loaf of bread, you know,
peanut butter and jelly and

298
00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:46.900
a jar and knives, all
of this on the table.

299
00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:49.660
And you ask them to
give you instructions. And then

300
00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:52.300
they'll say, all right, what
would I do first to

301
00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:54.490
make a peanut butter and
jelly? And they're like, okay,

302
00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:57.310
open the bread. So I
just took the bag and

303
00:15:57.310 --> 00:15:59.980
ripped it in half. And
the bread went flying everywhere.

304
00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:02.950
But you know, the engineer
in me says, well, you

305
00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:07.030
didn't specify. So, you know,
there's some things that are

306
00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:09.880
assumptions, but it's, it's breaking
it down to like the

307
00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:14.500
most simplified tasks. And There's,
you know, the old software

308
00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:17.950
engineering joke where a spouse
tells a software engineer to

309
00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:20.740
go to the store and
says, go to, yeah, go

310
00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:22.990
to the store, get some
eggs in and get some

311
00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:25.480
bread. And if they have
a X get 12, and

312
00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:27.160
then they come back with
12 loaves of bread and

313
00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:28.210
it's like, well, I don't
know. Why did you do

314
00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:32.140
that? Well, they had eggs.
Yeah. That's the way, that's

315
00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:34.210
the way we work. Right.
That's the way engineers work.

316
00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:36.280
One of the things that
I thought was really cool

317
00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:40.360
in episode three of Lego
masters, you wore your own

318
00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:44.490
custom dress and you three
D printed stuff. And you're,

319
00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:48.610
you're really a big passionate
three D printer user. And

320
00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:50.380
actually one of the fun
things that I thought when

321
00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:53.320
you were on the show,
you were describing how you

322
00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:57.370
built something with Lego, you
described it within the context

323
00:16:57.370 --> 00:16:59.110
of three D printing and
infill. Maybe you could talk

324
00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:01.540
about that. Yeah. So that
I'm very happy that they

325
00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:05.500
showed that. So, and episode
two, we actually got to

326
00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:08.470
blow up our bills with
dynamite and we got to

327
00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:12.040
blow up and destroy. Our
Lego builds. We dropped them

328
00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:13.900
off a two story on
the guest on the second

329
00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:18.010
floor. And it's not every
day, you get to destroy

330
00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:20.410
your build. So not only
did it have to like

331
00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:23.140
break, but it had to
be sturdy, but we didn't

332
00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:25.780
want to be wasting bricks
and making a completely solid.

333
00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:29.140
So a lot of times
in three D printing say,

334
00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:32.560
you're going to three D
print a cube. You would

335
00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:35.860
not print that at a
hundred percent, which means it

336
00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:38.620
would be completely solid. When
if you do that, that's

337
00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:44.290
wasting materials. It takes longer,
it may be stronger, but

338
00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:47.110
you can also get that
same strength from different types

339
00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:52.170
of infill. For example, I,
the honeycomb reference, because it's

340
00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:54.330
printing it as a, a
honeycomb, so you get the

341
00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:57.360
support structure on the inside.
So we did that. So

342
00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:00.510
not to waste Lego brick,
but it's the exact same

343
00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:03.420
idea that you use in
three D printing as well.

344
00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:07.860
And yeah, it worked the
build, the building looks glorious

345
00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:09.810
when it broke and we
were able to fill it

346
00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:13.890
with all the sparkle and
Lego bananas. We made the

347
00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:16.350
biggest bang. I think it
took the set crew like

348
00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:19.170
20 minutes to clean up.
And it was the entire

349
00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:21.540
build came off the moon.
Like we have this moon

350
00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:24.600
platform on set and the
platform actually moved in. There

351
00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:30.030
were like, so I guess
no one knows you don't,

352
00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:32.730
you have no idea what's
going to happen. And even

353
00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:35.880
with the dynamite, we were
laughing because they gave us

354
00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:39.840
glasses and earplugs, but I'm
like, what about the rest

355
00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:44.780
of our bodies? No one
wants to manage databases if

356
00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:48.530
they can avoid it. That's
why Mongo DB made Mongo

357
00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:52.490
DB Atlas, a global cloud
database service that runs on

358
00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:57.200
AWS, GCP and Azure. You
can deploy a fully managed

359
00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:00.710
Mongo DB database in minutes
with just a few clicks

360
00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:05.030
or a few API calls,
Mongo DB, Atlas, automates deployment,

361
00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:08.570
automates updates, handles scaling, and
more so that you can

362
00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:11.450
focus on your application instead
of taking care of your

363
00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:18.410
database, you can get started
free@mongodb.com slash Atlas. Now, if

364
00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:21.470
you're already managing a Mongo
DB deployment, Atlas has a

365
00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:25.280
live migration service. So you
can migrate it easily with

366
00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:28.310
minimal downtime and then get
back to what matters, stop

367
00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:33.170
managing your database and start
using Mongo DB Atlas. So

368
00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:35.810
your, your work and your,
your work that you do

369
00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:38.780
with your costumes and your
bills and your maker, things

370
00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:43.130
is very kind of interdisciplinary.
And I know that while

371
00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:45.350
I'm teaching my kids and
I'm teaching the kids at

372
00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:49.790
the schools that I volunteer
at these individual disciplines, I

373
00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:52.340
have a little bit of
trouble getting them to combine

374
00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:55.010
together. Like that example that
you just gave was a

375
00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:58.190
really good example, where knowledge
you had in the three

376
00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:00.710
D printing space combined with
knowledge you had in the

377
00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:03.200
Lego space. And then, you
know, one plus one is

378
00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:05.750
three in that context. And
then when you put all

379
00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:08.240
of those things together into
a build, whether that build

380
00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:11.510
be a costume or something
that you've made, you're really

381
00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:14.420
good at combining all of
these different things. What's a

382
00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:16.760
good way to get either
our listeners, people who are

383
00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:19.450
interested in some of these
things as a hobby or

384
00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:23.300
young people combining these two
things in unusual ways and

385
00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:26.090
getting them to think about
things beyond just the siloed

386
00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:28.610
work of, Oh, I made
a piece of plastic crap

387
00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:30.770
with a three D printer.
Yeah. That's what I said

388
00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:35.510
forever using things for that.
They're unintended purpose. So I'll

389
00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:39.860
teach workshops sometimes for kids
or adults. And especially if

390
00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:42.410
they're new to electronics, they
won't understand why do I

391
00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:45.110
need to learn how to
do any soldering for these

392
00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:48.820
electronics? So I would go
through this workshop of, you

393
00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:51.610
know, teaching them, them, you
know, this basic microcontroller, how

394
00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:54.640
to do soldering. And they're
like, okay, that's kind of

395
00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:57.880
cool. But then we would
three D print a sword.

396
00:20:57.910 --> 00:21:00.160
And then we would put
in electronics in the sword

397
00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:01.990
and make it glow or
make it move. And they're

398
00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:06.310
like, Oh, that's what you
can use that for. You

399
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:09.460
just need to get that
Oh moment. Like from them

400
00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:13.270
that they really, they really
combine something that they think

401
00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:19.210
is this every day, I
guess you're overlooking it. Yeah.

402
00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:23.500
It's always, everyone thinks so
different. And I've learned that

403
00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:28.240
as I've traveled more and
people ask they're like, how

404
00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:30.220
do I find a hobby
or how do I find

405
00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:33.070
a passion? And I'm like,
Oh, cause I've never really

406
00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:36.430
had those problems. If anything,
I need to like stop

407
00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:40.260
doing something. I think we
can commiserate a little bit

408
00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:45.240
on that because I was
like having built in motivation,

409
00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:49.050
built in passion and not
knowing why. And then becoming

410
00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:52.500
frustrated with people who don't,
I think is a bias

411
00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:54.990
that I'm working on. You
know, like we can't just

412
00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:58.710
assume that everyone's geeked. Yeah.
And that's, and you know,

413
00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:01.020
I used to just say
like say yes, to doing

414
00:22:01.050 --> 00:22:05.280
more things, because that's where
sometimes I get my best

415
00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:08.040
ideas is somebody says, Hey,
can you check out this

416
00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:10.650
project? And I'm like, okay,
I don't really have time,

417
00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:15.060
but it gives me inspiration.
And you're also that. So

418
00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:16.800
I have a really good
example. So I know someone

419
00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:20.070
that works on pins, they
make pins on the metal

420
00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:25.260
lave and or in the
Woodlake. And yeah. So, but

421
00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:29.180
I'm like pens. I'm like,
okay. I'm like, sure. I

422
00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:31.290
was like, I'll look at
it. Like he wanted me

423
00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:32.730
to look at the mechanics
of the gears on the

424
00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:36.030
inside. And then I saw
that he was actually like

425
00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:38.760
taking this block of acrylic
or this piece of wood

426
00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:42.990
and milling these, I mean,
they're gorgeous pens. And then

427
00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:45.900
it got me thinking I'm
like, somebody really liked pens

428
00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:49.080
think about like in, but
they have the pens that

429
00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:51.810
they can use for NASA.
Somebody made a pen that

430
00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:55.830
you can write in a
no gravity space. Like somebody

431
00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:59.310
likes something so much that
they figured it out, or

432
00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:02.730
it was just their, I
guess, their passion project. And

433
00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:05.910
I don't know. So like
never overlooked something that you

434
00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:08.850
think is as simple as
a pen. My, my dad

435
00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:11.640
likes to likes to hunt
and I'm not a big

436
00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:13.590
fan of guns and I
don't want to go a

437
00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:15.300
no, unless you give the
deer a gun. I don't

438
00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:17.820
want to, you know, no
reason to go and shoot

439
00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:19.680
a deer. So he's like,
well, I'll, I'll go and

440
00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:21.480
I'll hunt, but I wanna,
I only use a bow

441
00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:23.580
and arrow and then he
would go and use a

442
00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:25.020
bow and arrow and he
couldn't hit the broad side

443
00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:27.570
of a barn, but then
it less, it became less

444
00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:29.640
about the hunting for the
deer and more about making

445
00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:31.530
the bow and arrow. So
first he would buy a

446
00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:34.260
bow and arrow and then
he would go and cut

447
00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:37.320
down a tree and get
the, and get the specific

448
00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:39.630
piece of wood and then
bend it with water over

449
00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:41.970
a course of months and
then go and string the

450
00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:45.470
bows. So now he'll spend
like a year making a

451
00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:49.520
custom bow and arrow using
traditional first peoples native American

452
00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:53.120
techniques so that he can
go out and then miss

453
00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:55.550
the deer and come back
with nothing. But it was

454
00:23:55.550 --> 00:23:58.430
the journey of the creation
of the, of the bow

455
00:23:58.430 --> 00:24:00.680
and arrow. And now he
has this club of old

456
00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:02.870
people that he gets together
with every week and they

457
00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:08.320
make traditional native bows. Yeah.
The community like that's, how

458
00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:10.930
do you find a community
of other people that are

459
00:24:10.930 --> 00:24:15.310
interested in the same things
that you are? And when

460
00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:17.950
you get that community, when
you find your place, then

461
00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:20.520
things start clicking and then
you become more creative. And

462
00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:23.230
you said that you were
homeschooled, you were kind of

463
00:24:23.290 --> 00:24:27.940
in your home until mid-teens.
Did you build a, could

464
00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:30.550
you discover a community? Did
you come upon a community

465
00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:34.120
of makers or was it
in real, like meet space

466
00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:38.290
or did you do this
online? So I guess online

467
00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:40.180
or that's I try to
think about the first things

468
00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:43.030
I ever shared, really when
it came just to the

469
00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:47.410
internet and I would share
gosh, anything from like a

470
00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:49.180
costume and be like, I
made this technique, or I

471
00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:52.420
added these LEDs to it.
And I'm like, man, this

472
00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:55.030
is terrible, but I am
so proud of it. And

473
00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:57.700
there's like, nothing more Epic
than putting on like, you

474
00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:00.850
know, some Cape or costume
or something that you've made

475
00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:04.690
with love and a few
curse words. And then it's

476
00:25:04.690 --> 00:25:06.400
interesting. Cause people would be
like, Oh, how did you

477
00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:09.460
do this? Or I had
the same problem. And that's

478
00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:12.280
how you iterate and you
become better. It's this, the

479
00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:17.890
sharing process, You know? And
here's the thing though, when

480
00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:19.960
you go and do something
like that and you put

481
00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:24.160
it out there, that first
reaction, if someone's like, Hey,

482
00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:25.880
great job. Even though if
it was garbage or not,

483
00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:29.260
doesn't matter. Right? Like that,
that enthusiastic, I made this

484
00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:32.080
and that's awesome. Can be
the difference about whether or

485
00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:34.840
not you drop out of
the fandom entirely. And that's

486
00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:36.610
why it's so important that
we have a welcoming and

487
00:25:36.610 --> 00:25:39.880
kind community because a 16
year old making something and

488
00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:41.650
putting out on the internet
and having everyone tease them

489
00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:43.120
for it is a good
way to just turn them

490
00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:46.600
off of making altogether. Yup.
I agree. And I really

491
00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:49.900
always try to stress, like,
you know, you should share

492
00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:54.550
everything, even if you think
it sucks and you're going

493
00:25:54.550 --> 00:25:57.310
to get, you're gonna either
inspire someone enough to make

494
00:25:57.310 --> 00:25:59.020
their own, you're going to
get feedback and you're going

495
00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:01.720
to be able to improve
upon it. But this idea

496
00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:05.350
of like perfection that it's
movie perfect. The first time

497
00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:08.230
I have a friend that
owns a prop shop and

498
00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:11.110
they make all the stuff
for the Mandalorian. And I

499
00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:13.780
remember when they were working
on the Mandalorian stuff a

500
00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:15.370
few years ago and I
was in the shop. I'm

501
00:26:15.370 --> 00:26:18.760
like, what is this? And
then like, I saw it,

502
00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:22.000
you know, watching the Mandalorian.
I was like, wow. I

503
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.360
was like, I saw where
that started. Wow. You know,

504
00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:28.180
every, everyone starts from this
beginning of, they don't know

505
00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:30.490
what they're doing and they,
they have, you have no

506
00:26:30.490 --> 00:26:35.410
knowledge, right? It's you collectively
over the years, I always

507
00:26:35.410 --> 00:26:37.990
work on projects that I'm
not doing the same thing.

508
00:26:38.290 --> 00:26:41.680
You don't have to completely
start from scratch, but take

509
00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:43.950
some things that, you know,
and then add one new

510
00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:46.830
thing that you don't know.
So maybe you already know

511
00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:48.720
how to make work with
foam. You're going to make

512
00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:52.770
a foam costume, but you've
never worked with LEDs. So

513
00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:55.800
just add some things you
already know and add one

514
00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:59.960
new thing to that. Hm.
As we get towards the

515
00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:01.580
end here, I want to
make sure that folks that

516
00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:04.190
are listening, go and check
out Lego masters on Fox.

517
00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:06.050
Cause we have really enjoyed
it. I think there's quite

518
00:27:06.050 --> 00:27:08.900
a few episodes left. And
hopefully by the time I

519
00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:14.510
put this show out, there'll
be continued episodes. I've I

520
00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:17.060
mean, I watch reality TV
and I always wonder like

521
00:27:17.090 --> 00:27:20.090
how real is it? Are
you all really there building

522
00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:25.760
Legos for 15 hours without
sleeping? Yes. Well, so here's

523
00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:28.100
the thing. So the set
is union, so they get

524
00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:33.890
breaks, right? Yes. So that
is, that is one thing.

525
00:27:33.890 --> 00:27:35.870
So if say it's an
18 hour build that may

526
00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:39.680
be filmed over two days,
but you are, you were

527
00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:43.010
miked up, you know, 24
seven, except when you're sleeping.

528
00:27:44.030 --> 00:27:46.610
That time clock is so
real. When we were going

529
00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:51.080
back and watching, like I
think episode three, my Lego

530
00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:53.960
partner, crystal, when we were
sitting at the house, I

531
00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:56.780
was fidgeting with my button
and she's like, what are

532
00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:59.270
you doing? And I'm like,
it's giving me like posttraumatic

533
00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:02.150
stress, like watching the clock
go down and the red

534
00:28:02.150 --> 00:28:05.990
light. And it's just so
interesting to see how they've

535
00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:09.710
put it all together because
so I think episode one,

536
00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:13.760
there's 20 people. It was
a 15 hour build. So

537
00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:16.580
that is a lot of
time. I don't envy the

538
00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:20.060
editing team at all. Yeah.
I mean, so you're saying

539
00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:22.820
you're miked up the whole
time. Something's rolling in some

540
00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:25.400
way, you know, someone's taking
a break, someone, else's got

541
00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:27.830
some rolling, they're trying to
capture everything and they condense

542
00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:32.540
it all down into 42
minutes. It was extremely stressful.

543
00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:34.730
And then they go and
they will our net, the

544
00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:38.150
host screams and one hour
left. And then it's like,

545
00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:40.880
go, go, go, go, go.
Yeah. That the time clock,

546
00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:43.220
all of that is real
though. I will say one

547
00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:45.020
of the best parts about
the show is we had

548
00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:48.860
a designated teams to pick
up after us and sort

549
00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:51.350
all of our bricks every
night. Cause we're there for

550
00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:55.100
18 hours a day. So
for girls, you know, our

551
00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:57.140
call time was at four
30 in the morning for

552
00:28:57.140 --> 00:29:00.620
hair and makeup. The guys
was at like six. So

553
00:29:00.770 --> 00:29:08.870
that's a noxious. Yeah. That's
totally unacceptable. This is so

554
00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:10.340
you didn't have to clean
up though, which is good.

555
00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:11.690
Like you could play as
much as you want and

556
00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:13.190
you didn't have to clean
up. Yeah. And we had

557
00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:16.670
access to 3 million bricks and
they're already pre sorted. You

558
00:29:16.670 --> 00:29:18.620
know, I always say one
of the hardest parts is

559
00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:22.880
like part procurement for anything,
whether it's electronics Lego, it

560
00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:25.130
doesn't matter. And so it
was really nice to have

561
00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:27.920
like this team do that
for us. I remember telling

562
00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:29.480
my dad after I'm like,
I don't have to clean

563
00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:32.510
my room tonight when we
were on set. So if

564
00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:34.670
you needed a specific brick,
you want an element of

565
00:29:34.670 --> 00:29:36.550
a certain kind and you
knew the name of it

566
00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:38.600
was your Lego expert. You
say, Oh, I need a

567
00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:41.060
three, three by one dah,
dah, dah. And they would

568
00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:43.270
and find it or was
it label makers? How did

569
00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:46.020
you find what you needed?
So that was one thing.

570
00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:48.540
It took, you know, a
little while to get used

571
00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:50.670
to where they had done
all the layouts and the,

572
00:29:50.670 --> 00:29:53.280
the brick room. So they
had done everything on the

573
00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:56.430
left side of the brick
pit based on like plates.

574
00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:58.320
And it would start by,
you know, one by twos,

575
00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:00.450
two by fours, all the
way up. And then the

576
00:30:00.450 --> 00:30:02.760
right side of the brick
pit would be, you know,

577
00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:05.490
technical pieces, mini figs. And
so we had a brick

578
00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:08.160
binder that we were able
to use for reference on

579
00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:10.710
set if we forgot where
they were, but it took

580
00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:12.570
us a few days just
to pick up where everything

581
00:30:12.570 --> 00:30:17.850
was and if we needed
something, you know, since we're

582
00:30:17.850 --> 00:30:20.820
miked up and they're always
listening, we would say, Hey,

583
00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:23.640
we're trying to find this,
you know, one by two,

584
00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:26.490
you know, ball joint, where
are they? And then they

585
00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:29.280
would, they would tell us,
but at some point you're

586
00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:33.180
like, you're just running around
in a Cape and cosplay

587
00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:37.890
building Lego, The, the, the,
the brick binder. I don't

588
00:30:37.890 --> 00:30:39.690
remember any scenes where they
shown that. So that seems

589
00:30:39.690 --> 00:30:41.550
like a piece of movie
magic that isn't quite as

590
00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:43.590
interesting as watching someone go
through a giant three ring

591
00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:45.870
binder looking. Yeah. They, you
know, they didn't want wanna,

592
00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:48.810
they don't want to show
that on onset Bush, which

593
00:30:48.810 --> 00:30:52.440
I get. So, you know,
they also yeah. Like say

594
00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:54.240
so, like we had safety
meetings for like, when we

595
00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:56.190
would blow stuff up with
dynamite, you know, you're having

596
00:30:56.190 --> 00:30:58.710
an offscreen pirate with a
T you know, talk with

597
00:30:58.710 --> 00:31:00.960
the pyro. Right. Oh, wow.
So it was really dynamite.

598
00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:03.000
It wasn't like it's compressed.
Yeah. It was, nobody was

599
00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.410
real dynamite. So Did it
actually break a Lego? Did

600
00:31:06.410 --> 00:31:09.330
it actually destroy an element?
And that's what I find

601
00:31:09.330 --> 00:31:12.330
is so fascinating. Cause they
used me as like a

602
00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:14.340
pack mule and they like
took some bricks out of

603
00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:18.210
my, like hood in my
dragon dress. And like when

604
00:31:18.210 --> 00:31:20.670
you it's really interesting because
Lego bricks are done through

605
00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:24.030
like injection molding. And when
we looked at the ones

606
00:31:24.030 --> 00:31:27.000
that blow with dynamites, all
the studs on the top

607
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.190
of the Lego bricks were
the first to blow off.

608
00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:32.970
And so I kept a
few of them because I

609
00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:35.400
just thought that was like
so fascinating that, you know,

610
00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:38.010
when they're doing this injection
molding process, that that is

611
00:31:38.010 --> 00:31:41.820
the, I guess the technically
the weak point and cause

612
00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:44.520
Lego bricks are made from
abs plastic, which is, you

613
00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:46.410
know, you can use that
with three D printing as

614
00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:53.100
well. But yeah, no, I
have not. You have to

615
00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:55.530
go. I did some work
with lego.com and I went

616
00:31:55.530 --> 00:31:57.630
to our house and I
went and walked around on

617
00:31:57.630 --> 00:32:00.900
the floor where they do
the actual work and make

618
00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:03.840
them, and it's just bananas.
I'll show you some pictures

619
00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:06.780
sometime. Yes. I would absolutely
love that. I was talking

620
00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:07.830
to, I was like, I
just want to know their

621
00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:12.210
entire process and how they
yes. Make it worth it.

622
00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:16.560
Fantastic. Well, thank you so
much, Amy Daniel, Dan's me Amy

623
00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:21.960
double D you can find
amy@amiedd.com and on Twitter and

Great show for adults and

626
00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:29.850
kids alike. My family has
had a wonderful time watching

627
00:32:29.850 --> 00:32:32.430
it. I really appreciate you
chatting with me today. Yes,

628

absolutely. Thanks so much. This
has been another episode of

629
00:32:35.250 --> 00:32:49.340
