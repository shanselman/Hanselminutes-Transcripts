00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.740
In this episode, Scott and
Kroll discussed ways to become

12
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:24.480
a better developer. Hi, this
is Carl Franklin. You're listening to

13
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.720
Hansel minutes from Hanselman it's
dot com. Scott is here.

14
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.580
I am here. All is
right with the world. Hi

15
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.420
Scott, how are you, sir?
I'm well, what's up today?

16
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.600
What are you going to
do over the next six

17
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.700
months to be a better
developer? This is the question

18
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.520
that has been been posed.
I'm going to listen to

19
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.320
Hansel minutes every day that
I possibly can. And that

20
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.850
will just make you a
huge geek. This guy named

21
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.230
justice gray blogged about he's
going to read a developer

22
00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.430
book every week for the
next 27 weeks. Ah, and

23
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.320
he listed all the books.
He's going to read with

24
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.840
a couple of slots open
for people to suggest. When

25
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.300
is he ever going to
write code? I don't know,

26
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.210
but he asks after listing
all of these books that

27
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.160
he's going to read, he
says, you know, the, the

28
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.060
trick is if you want
to accomplish a goal, you're

29
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.490
write it down. Which of
course we've talked about before

30
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.490
and he's talked about before,
but most importantly is share

31
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.130
it with other people, right?
Right. Can't just decide to

32
00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.000
quit smoking and then tell
no one. So what he's

33
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.080
doing is he's saying I'm
going to be a better

34
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.390
developer and he's blogged about
it. So that's his share

35
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.450
it with someone else. And
then my buddy in Canada,

36
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.440
bill <inaudible> has posted being
a better developer in six

37
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.110
months. And this is kind
of a blog meme. It

38
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.640
spreads around because they usually
usually asked to tag people,

39
00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.060
you know, tag people like
tag, you're it kind of,

40
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.820
yeah, exactly. So the way
that you get these things

41
00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.530
to spread, as you say,
you know, here are five

42
00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.390
movies I want to see
and here's five people and

43
00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.070
I want to hear about
their five movies. It's the

44
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.530
classic a pyramid scheme in
this case here, though, he's

45
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:03.880
saying here's what I'm going
to do to be a

46
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.940
better developer for the next
six months. And in the

47
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.910
tagging, he's tagged myself and
a couple of other folks

48
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:15.250
like Andy Raheen and Jeremy Miller,
Jeremy Palermo, Rocky Locka. And

49
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.840
I'm sure that this will
spread all over the place.

50
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.120
So by the time that
this episode of Hansel minutes

51
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.940
has come out, everyone in
the internet has posted what

52
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.800
they're going to do for
the next six months. Not

53
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.930
very good, but I thought
it was a pretty darn

54
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.510
good question. And it got
me thinking about that kind

55
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.870
of stuff. You know, we've
discussed Ruby before and how

56
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.780
this year Ruby was the
language that, that I was

57
00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.030
going to try to teach
myself in order to be

58
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.540
a better, better developer. And
it, it seems that if

59
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.300
you, if you want to
be a better developer, the

60
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.050
really the first step is
making the decision, like accepting

61
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:48.870
the problem. What is the,
what are the tools? 12

62
00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.860
steps, the 12 steps to
being a Becker develop. Yeah.

63
00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.070
First one is accepting you
have a problem, right. You

64
00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.430
know, I'm not nearly the
developer that I think I

65
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.130
am, that I, that I
would want to be right.

66
00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.730
My name is Carl Franklin and
I suck as a developer.

67
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.690
Carl. Yeah. It's a, it's
kind of like that, but

68
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.860
he, bill has a very
good outline here. And he

69
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.350
talks about reading is one,
right? So he's reading books

70
00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.360
and people are always emailing
me and asking about what

71
00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.730
books they should read to
become a better developer. And

72
00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.220
I think that's a part
of it. But for me,

73
00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.150
it's less about reading books
about development. I'm realizing this

74
00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.220
is just for me, everyone
has their different learning style

75
00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.460
for me. It's about reading
other people's code. Cause I

76
00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.350
really feel like if you
want to be a good

77
00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.860
writer, like say you're writing
novels or fiction, I think

78
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.780
the way to be a
good writer is to read

79
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.690
as much as you can.
Yeah, exactly. So I'm finding

80
00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.390
that I become a better
developer when I read more

81
00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.960
of other people's code. I'm
totally in agreement with you

82
00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.680
100%. Yes. In fact, I
learned a lot in my

83
00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.250
earliest days of teaching myself
programming just by reading other

84
00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.780
people's code, good code, not
other people's bad code, not

85
00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.210
other people's bad code. You
learn the bad habits from

86
00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:08.250
that. Well, so I think
that the trick is finding

87
00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.000
good code to read. Right?
Sure. Now, certainly in, in,

88
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.890
in one's reading, they can
read good code and bad

89
00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:15.570
code just as you can
read good fiction and bad

90
00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.340
fiction. But you know, if
you really want to be

91
00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.380
a great writer of fiction,
you're going to want to

92
00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.920
read as many good books
as possible. So I needed

93
00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.790
to find a pile of
really good code. So then

94
00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:29.100
what is good code, right?
Is it beautiful code? Is

95
00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.080
it successful code? Is it
code with a lot of

96
00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.820
coverage? And then I figured
that code that is good

97
00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:39.120
is code that is used
right. Code that a lot

98
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.950
of people are using code
that is in a successful

99
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:45.060
project code that runs yeah.
Code the runs. And this

100
00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.780
is not necessarily academically beautiful
code, but it is code

101
00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.110
that is successful because people
use it. Right. So, you

102
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.270
know, the, maybe the folks
that are on the projects

103
00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:58.640
like, you know, RSS, bandit
or DAS or subtext, don't

104
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.980
think their code is very
beautiful. As someone who works

105
00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.440
on dusk blog, I can
assure you that when you

106
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.540
have looked into the code
base of dusk blog, you've

107
00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:09.800
looked into the face of
evil, but it is, but

108
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.630
it works. And it works
for us and we enjoy

109
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:13.070
it and we have a
good time and we do

110
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:15.410
some neat stuff. And then
we sell our souls and

111
00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:16.940
then we do some neat
stuff and we sell our

112
00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.760
souls. So one of the
things that I'm going to

113
00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.710
do to make myself a
better developer is spend some

114
00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:24.980
time reading, not just using,
but reading some of the

115
00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:28.490
code that I think is,
is pretty slick. I'm going

116
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:31.340
to spend some time looking
at the castle project. You

117
00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.460
talked a little bit about
monorail, right? When you talked

118
00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:35.480
to the guys up at
Ellucian software in Seattle, there,

119
00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:38.840
I've decided that for the
next six months, during the

120
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.700
next six months, I'm going
to spend some time looking

121
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:45.530
at the whole castle project
stack. That means monorail. That

122
00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:47.990
means the aversion of control
container. And I think we're

123
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:49.700
going to do a show
in the next week or

124
00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.610
two on inversion of control
and dependency injection. I think

125
00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:55.760
it's an important topic we
haven't covered yet. The Windsor,

126
00:06:55.910 --> 00:07:00.200
the Windsor container, also the
dependency injection object builder stuff

127
00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.600
that came in the enterprise
library. Right. I'm going to

128
00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.490
read this code, I'm going
to try to understand what's

129
00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:07.100
going on. Not just skim
it, but really try to,

130
00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:09.710
you know, grok it, try
to drink it in. Yeah.

131
00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:13.250
I think the enterprise library,
the stuff that Microsoft patterns

132
00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:17.300
and practices released, sometimes that
gets a bad rap. It's

133
00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.460
a different kind of code,
right? I mean, it's still

134
00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.710
good, but it has a
different feel just like different

135
00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:24.830
writers in a fiction, have
a different, a different vibe.

136
00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:27.160
Well, and then also there's
so much code there and

137
00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:31.270
so many different categories that
you really can't consider it

138
00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:34.090
all as one piece. Yeah,
definitely. And you can, if

139
00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:36.070
you know the guy Isn't
the team, you can tell

140
00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:38.680
who was in, where as
they try to keep things

141
00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.960
looking the same. Right. You
know, I think I learned

142
00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.180
a lot from taking a
look at the code within

143
00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:46.060
reflector of the base class
framework, you know, looking at.net

144
00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:48.640
and kind of, you're not
necessarily reading the code because

145
00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.460
you're looking at it decompile,
but you're, you're gleaning the

146
00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:55.870
programmer's intent by looking at
what reflector thinks, you know,

147
00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:58.480
they meant, and, and that,
that can help in design

148
00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:00.190
a frameworks. But I want
to sit down and read

149
00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:03.490
pro you know, I wanna
look at subtext, flex team

150
00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:06.430
stuff, very well thought of,
and I think there's a

151
00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:08.560
lot of stuff that the
DAS blog team can learn

152
00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:11.710
from subtext. And I want
to check that out. Where

153
00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:13.990
would you think would be
a good place to find

154
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.840
a lot of good, good
code to read Carl? I

155
00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.210
mean, you mentioned them, the
enterprise library is a great

156
00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:23.980
place to start. The, the,
anything that's a public domain

157
00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:27.190
kind of open source project
is also a great thing

158
00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:29.650
because what's good about that
is you get many eyes

159
00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:33.880
looking at and revising code,
you know, and, and stuff

160
00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:37.960
that's open source tends to
be a little more, well,

161
00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:40.870
you know, I won't say
polished, but the guys who

162
00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:42.730
are writing that the guys
and gals who were writing

163
00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:45.010
that stuff, they know that
the eyes are looking at

164
00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:48.070
it. So it's T it
tends to be more commented.

165
00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:50.320
And it tends to be
thought out a little bit

166
00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.630
more than just stuff that's
slapped together, that you could

167
00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:56.250
coerce a developer into sharing
with you. Something wasn't meant

168
00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:59.450
for public view. That's an
interesting perspective. I would, I

169
00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:02.360
would partially agree. I would
say that when you're writing

170
00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:05.150
a framework that people are
using, like if you're writing

171
00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:07.760
on the castle project or
you're writing patterns, practices, if

172
00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:10.520
you're writing code, that is
definitely going to be reused

173
00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:13.670
by other folks as code,
I think you're right. You

174
00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:16.850
spend a lot more time
making it clean. I think

175
00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:20.330
if you're writing an app
like an RSS reader, maybe

176
00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:23.090
that you'd be more willing
to go nuts because it's

177
00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:25.670
the end user who wants
the experience. And beauty is

178
00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:28.610
secondary. Yeah. Another thing to
do is to take a

179
00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:31.610
look at your third party
tools. And it's some of

180
00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:35.090
the samples that come with
those tools. Yeah. Those are,

181
00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:37.310
those are usually done with
an eye towards, you know,

182
00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:39.770
we wanna, we want to
do something that's happening in

183
00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:43.340
the mainstream and we need
to show them The right

184
00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:45.920
way to do it. Yeah,
definitely. So I think reading

185
00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.140
is a big part of
this. I'm also going to

186
00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:51.800
be reading a book called
what is it called? It's

187
00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.380
something it's F sharp, hang
on a second. Is it

188
00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:57.320
practical? You know, it seems
like every book these days

189
00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:01.580
is either practical, pragmatic, professional.
Powerful. Do you want to

190
00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:03.520
say that again? No. Hang
on. Because this is, this

191
00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:05.930
is a good thing to
keep in here because I

192
00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:08.180
can never remember. Is it,
is it the professional one,

193
00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:10.490
the practical, one of the
pragmatic one that is the

194
00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:11.930
book I want to read.
Let me check my bag

195
00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:14.870
here. Something that starts with
P I'm pulling this out

196
00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:19.520
of my bag. It is
foundations foundations of F sharp

197
00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:22.820
reading this book by Robert
Pickering. It's an a press

198
00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:26.120
book. These are the yellow
books. Okay. F sharp is

199
00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:29.420
a, a functional programming language
kind of based on like

200
00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:33.830
ML, but it lets you
use a dotnet front end

201
00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:36.880
framework. And it has a
performance kind of profile, like,

202
00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:41.090
like C-sharp, so it's really
fast, but it's got functional

203
00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:45.290
programming perspective. It's comparative programming
perspectives. It's got Audrey jointed.

204
00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:48.410
And I got into this
because I had put up

205
00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.690
a, a list of books
on my blog that was

206
00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:57.170
called like top language agnostic
programming books to read. And

207
00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.900
one of the guys in
the, in the comments call

208
00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:01.340
me on it. And he
said, this is not language

209
00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:05.660
agnostic. You've described a bunch
of object oriented books to

210
00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:08.030
what about the functional programming
paradigms? You know, there's a

211
00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:10.970
lot more out there than
just a if then else.

212
00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:14.000
And it got me thinking,
and then I saw this

213
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.830
book on F sharp and
I said, well, it's got

214
00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:17.720
a, it's got the little
sharp sign in it, then

215
00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:20.810
it must be good. Right.
It's it's F sharp. So

216
00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:22.370
it must be a D
E F it must be

217
00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:24.470
two, three times better than
she sharp. I like the

218
00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:28.070
key of F sharp. Exactly.
You know, Sharp, minor, quite

219
00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:32.420
a quite brooding. Yeah. Well,
if, sometimes it's difficult for

220
00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:34.820
me, at least when you
do, you know, kind of,

221
00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:37.190
I wouldn't say drink the
Microsoft Kool-Aid, but sip it

222
00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:40.730
at least to a, to
go kind of totally the

223
00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:44.150
opposite direction and go download
something like Haskell or hugs

224
00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:46.430
and start to do that
kind of work because in

225
00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:48.140
the back of your mind,
you're thinking, well, how am

226
00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:50.270
I going to use this
in the real world? Right.

227
00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:51.890
I think it's, this is
just for me, at least

228
00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:53.500
perhaps, but if I want
to be a better developer,

229
00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:55.780
yes, I would like to
be more well rounded, but

230
00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:58.690
at the same time, I
need to make a use

231
00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:00.360
of the things that I
do on the side, in

232
00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:02.800
the real world. Right. So
doing Ruby on rails on

233
00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:05.110
the side, I still feel
like I can use that

234
00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:08.590
in the real world. Learning
Haskell or squeak, you know,

235
00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:12.490
at this point is squeak,
squeak, squeak. You check. We'll

236
00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:14.890
do a show on squeak.
Squeak. Just tell me what

237
00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:20.860
it is. It's a smalltalk
environment. Google. Yeah. Okay. Okay.

238
00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:23.740
Yes. And how is that
useful? Yeah, no squeak is

239
00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:27.160
a, a is a graphical
environments and open source, a

240
00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:32.500
small talk 80 language that
was written in small talk.

241
00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:34.960
And if you go to
squeak.org, you can check it

242
00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:37.050
out. You say it's graphical.
So you can program with

243
00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:39.810
kids. Oh, it's for kids.
I wouldn't say it's Or

244
00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:41.790
kids, but it is, it
is, it's like a, it's

245
00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:44.250
like an operating system, but
it's a, it's an environment

246
00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:47.880
and your, your kids might
like it. Now. Of course,

247
00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:49.170
I'm going to get in
trouble for saying it's for

248
00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:52.590
kids, but it's, it's a
virtual machine. It's got a

249
00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:56.250
lot of music and multimedia
things to use for educational

250
00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:59.400
platforms. It's, it's, it's a,
it's a powerful thing. We'll

251
00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.290
talk about it. I will
check that out. It's not

252
00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:03.480
something that I would necessarily
use every day at work.

253
00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:05.970
Okay. But I want to
be a better programmer. So

254
00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:08.010
how do I balance that?
And as far as using

255
00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:11.520
my time appropriately, so then
I saw F sharp and

256
00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:14.010
I said, okay, well, it's
totally weird. It's totally out

257
00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:18.060
there. It's totally not mainstream,
but it's, it's a Microsoft

258
00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:20.970
research project it's supported. I
can use it in visual

259
00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:24.630
studio. You know, it's funky
enough to help me spread,

260
00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:27.480
spread the wings a little
bit stretch outside of my

261
00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:30.420
comfort zone, but it's dot
net. So I can use

262
00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:32.940
it today. So this was
kind of a first step

263
00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:35.430
for, for me to go
kind of way out there

264
00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:38.760
and learn something completely different.
Right? So F sharp was

265
00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:41.820
a good compromise. So learning
to write F sharp is

266
00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:43.290
going to be a part
of that. And the foundations

267
00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:45.780
of F sharp book, I'm
about halfway through it. And

268
00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:50.610
I'm actually enjoying it very
much. Cool. Now speaking, you

269
00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:51.720
know, you, you and I
have done a lot of

270
00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:54.570
speaking on the road and
that kind of stuff. Do

271
00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:57.330
you think that that's a
thing that one could do

272
00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:59.400
to be a better developer?
Bill said this on his

273
00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:01.200
blog, that he thought that
that was a useful thing.

274
00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:04.050
I'm not so sure. I
think there are better uses

275
00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:05.820
of your time. If you're
trying to be a better

276
00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:09.120
developer than speaking, I would
say that, you know, all

277
00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:14.940
of these experiences help your
well-roundedness, but, you know, speaking

278
00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:18.480
is typically where you find
several topics and you go

279
00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.340
out and you hammer them
over and over and over

280
00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:24.300
and over again, there's a
lot of repetition and you

281
00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:28.320
don't always get feedback. You
know, you know, this was

282
00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:31.380
right on, this was not
so right on you don't,

283
00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:33.870
you don't always get it.
So you, you, you may

284
00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:36.360
have these situations where you
go out and you say

285
00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:41.610
something that somebody could take
the opposite position on, but

286
00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:44.250
you don't know that because
you're just, it's one sided.

287
00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:46.110
It's not a discussion. You
know what I mean? Right.

288
00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:48.540
Yeah. So I would tend
to, I would tend to

289
00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:53.090
think that a discussion would
be more beneficial than speaking.

290
00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:57.100
Yeah. I think that speaking
people, sometimes people want to

291
00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:58.900
speak at a local user's
group. I think those things

292
00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:00.940
are great, speak at a
conference. And I encourage people

293
00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:03.070
who want to do that,
to do that pub clubs,

294
00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:06.580
You know, those things where
you get together. I find

295
00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:09.400
that setting up a study
group at your company is

296
00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:12.430
a really useful thing. Yeah.
We started doing a work

297
00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:15.310
with type mock, you know,
after the mock objects framework.

298
00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:18.810
And we try to select
a mocking objects framework for

299
00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:21.100
us to use here at
Kirlian. So the way that

300
00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:24.370
we did that is we
had a, a mocking object

301
00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:26.860
study group, you know, meet,
meet a couple times a

302
00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:30.100
week at lunch, Thinking of
meeting at lunch. We found

303
00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:31.750
that a lot of people
are doing this with DNR

304
00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:34.840
TV. They're watching one day
a week. They get their

305
00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:37.600
developers together around a projector.
They have lunch and they

306
00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:42.730
watch an hour long, a
conversation presentation, demo, whatever DNR

307
00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:44.950
TV is, whatever you want
to call it. And then

308
00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:47.440
after that, they spend another
half an hour discussing it.

309
00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:51.040
That's a popular thing to
do. Yeah. I think that,

310
00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:52.810
I think that's a good
example. So I think that

311
00:15:52.810 --> 00:15:57.010
rather than speaking, I would
say hosting discussions. Yes. You

312
00:15:57.010 --> 00:16:00.580
know, talking to people literally
go to lunch with somebody.

313
00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:02.680
One of the things that
we've also been thinking about

314
00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:04.810
doing, we've done a little
bit here, but we haven't

315
00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:07.390
actually formalized it with, you
know, with HR and the

316
00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:10.660
bosses is taking a bunch
of our devs are a

317
00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:13.630
bunch of our developers out
to have lunch with other

318
00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:16.660
developers at another company. That's
not in a competitive situation.

319
00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:19.690
So it's almost like a
sister city kind of thing.

320
00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:22.240
Right. So find a company
locally. That's not in your

321
00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:25.030
space. Like, you know, you
do banking, they do insurance,

322
00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:27.700
right? Give them this, you
know, you can all sign

323
00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:31.510
NDAs all day long, but
sit down and compare notes.

324
00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:35.800
I'll go to lunch with
darn near anybody. You know

325
00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:38.140
what I'm saying? Sure. If
you buy me a sandwich,

326
00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:39.490
I'll talk to you for
as long as it takes

327
00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:43.510
me to eat that sandwich.
Last week, I had lunch

328
00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:50.290
at, at panic, panic.com. Panic
is a constant award-winning Macintosh

329
00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:54.190
developer shop. How did you
have lunch at a website?

330
00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:57.250
And I had lunch at
the website at the store

331
00:16:57.250 --> 00:16:59.680
of the website. I went
to college with Steve and

332
00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:03.550
Frank, one of the founders
of panic. And they w

333
00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:06.550
they want an Apple design
award. Again, this year. They

334
00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:09.400
win them year after year.
And I went down and

335
00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:11.590
saw their offices at, down
here in downtown Portland and

336
00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:13.570
had lunch with my buddy,
Steven, who I went to

337
00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:16.150
college with, and haven't seen
in awhile. And I said,

338
00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:18.340
well, you've got to come
on on the show and

339
00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:21.370
talk about the, you know,
Mac, because some of us

340
00:17:21.370 --> 00:17:23.320
just don't get it. Right.
It'd be really interesting. So

341
00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:24.520
we'll have him on the
show at some point in

342
00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:28.390
the next couple of weeks
and that kind of stuff.

343
00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:30.940
Having lunch with people outside
of your comfort zone, I

344
00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:33.040
find to be really useful
way to become a better

345
00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:35.980
developer. So how many Mac
developers does it take to

346
00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:39.040
copy a file? I don't
know how many, what, what's

347
00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:45.580
a file. Okay. How many
developers does it take to

348
00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:50.760
copy of file on Vista?
I don't. You can Actually,

349
00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:52.440
I don't know. I mean,
I don't know. I don't

350
00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:57.380
know either. It's still calculated
To call me in an

351
00:17:57.380 --> 00:18:04.040
hour. I'll tell you how
long it'll take. Oh, too

352
00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:07.760
much fun. I just made
that one up anyway. There's

353
00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:11.030
your fluff seconds for the
day. So what were we

354
00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:14.030
talking about? How to be
a better developer? Yeah. Going

355
00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:16.280
out to lunch with people
that are maybe outside of

356
00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:19.400
your comfort zone, working on
things that you, you're not

357
00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:22.460
working on, understanding how they
do their build servers, understanding

358
00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:24.650
how they do their continuous
integration, you know, do they

359
00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:27.650
do code coverage? How much
code coverage, talking to them

360
00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:31.040
about their software development life
cycle? Do they do agile?

361
00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:35.690
Do they do RUP right?
They do. Scrummerfall. Who knows?

362
00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:37.430
And we don't have to
tell you that if you're

363
00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:40.790
in a situation where you
don't have developers to bounce

364
00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:45.320
ideas off of readily available,
that listening to podcasts is

365
00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:47.720
another good way to be
a better developer. We hear

366
00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:49.430
it all the time. It's
about being a part of

367
00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:51.290
the conversation, you know? And
you brought up a really

368
00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:54.830
good point. What about the
single person shop? What about

369
00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:57.890
the guy who's listening to
this? Who's not driving to

370
00:18:57.890 --> 00:18:59.990
work because he just has
to go downstairs, put his

371
00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:01.490
slippers on, and now he's
at work. Right. And he's

372
00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:05.030
the only developer within a
hundred square miles. Well, I

373
00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:06.500
don't know about the, I
guess that's not what my

374
00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:09.470
Gunder lawyer would be. The
only guy who's living in

375
00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:12.230
a farm with a hundred
acres outside. I know quite

376
00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:15.020
a few of them. Yeah.
How do those guys get

377
00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:16.880
involved? They got to join
the conversation. I think if

378
00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:18.800
you can go to a
nerd dinner or a pub

379
00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:21.020
club, you gotta do it.
You got to get out

380
00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:23.390
there. I think that if
I were working on my

381
00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:25.790
own as a single person,
developer as a one man

382
00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:29.000
team, or as a remote
team, the being a part

383
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.120
of the conversation is so
much more important. If you

384
00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:35.120
can't stand up and walk
over to someone's cube, you

385
00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:36.740
should have a lot of
people on your I M

386
00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:40.160
list should have people on
Skype. You should go down

387
00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:42.740
and sit at a, at
Starbucks, find out where the

388
00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:46.190
other developers are. Is there
any such thing as a

389
00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:49.130
developer chat room these days?
I mean, I know that

390
00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:52.460
there are webcasts and things
like that, but, well, there

391
00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:56.960
is the IRC, interestingly, internet
relay chat, IRC seems to

392
00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:59.300
be coming back. There are
some people who are on

393
00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:02.420
it might say it never
left, but more and more,

394
00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:06.290
I'm seeing open source projects
that have a room dedicated

395
00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:11.600
to their, their project. Interesting.
So you'll see people who

396
00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:14.270
are enthusiastic about Ruby, who
will say, yeah, come visit

397
00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:17.090
us on the Ruby, the
Ruby room, or the rails

398
00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:20.060
room on a, on IRC.
And they'll just keep that

399
00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:22.850
window open all the time.
Just kind of watching for,

400
00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:26.940
for questions, for noobs, for
people who need help. And

401
00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:30.290
that is their virtual chat
room. Interesting here in Portland,

402
00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:32.480
we've got a thing called
cube space, which is kind

403
00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:35.090
of neat. It's actually a
rent, a cube rent, a

404
00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:39.410
cubicle. So it's a big,
giant open area with cubicles

405
00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:42.410
and internet connectivity and phones
and faxes. And it's basically

406
00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:44.840
a drop in and buy
an office for a day.

407
00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:48.430
Wow. And independents can do
to have a little bit

408
00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:52.030
more formal of an experience
than Starbucks, but still be

409
00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:53.950
able to kick ideas around
and talk to other people.

410
00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:57.220
Sounds good. Yeah. I think
being part of the conversation's

411
00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:01.090
important, that's all about community.
So we've got reading, reading

412
00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:03.370
as much code as you
can, reading books that you

413
00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:05.080
think, you know, don't force
yourself to read a book.

414
00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:06.790
If you don't think it's
gonna, I would agree. I

415
00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:10.720
think you run the risk
of becoming too academic. You

416
00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:13.990
really got to stay in
code as much as you

417
00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:16.720
can. You know, I really
like books that have a

418
00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:19.540
lot of code samples. I
definitely, you know, as much

419
00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:21.310
as I wish I were
a person who could read

420
00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:25.240
like design patterns and truly
like, love it and love

421
00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:26.950
every minute of it. I
just, I got to see

422
00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:30.100
the code. I think writing
is good. You know, getting

423
00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:33.010
it out there, but writing
is part of being in

424
00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:36.550
the conversation. Gee, you know,
we never said teaching. Yeah.

425
00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:38.560
Teaching is a great way
to be a developer. I

426
00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:41.080
mean, talking is what speaking
to, you know, doing a

427
00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:45.520
presentation is one thing, but
actually teaching a class is

428
00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:49.600
a great way to, to
sort of force yourself to

429
00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:52.360
learn something that you might
not know. Right. You'll never

430
00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:56.740
be a better data grid
expert than if you teach

431
00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:58.990
it for eight hours a
day in a small class.

432
00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:01.390
Yeah. Another way of course
is to get an intern.

433
00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:03.310
This might be a fun,
a funny way to say,

434
00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:05.230
how could I be a
better developer? Find an intern,

435
00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:08.830
huh? I've got two interns,
two high school interns go

436
00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:11.770
to your local high school,
go to your local community

437
00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:14.740
college and bring in an
intern. Maybe you pay them

438
00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:17.050
a stipend. Maybe you pay
them a, a, an hourly,

439
00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:20.500
hourly fee. But this is
going to be a fresh

440
00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:22.840
kind of open mind. Who's
going to drop into your

441
00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:25.960
developer environment. You're going to
find out what works, what

442
00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:27.700
doesn't, they're going to see
the real world. But it's

443
00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:30.160
also going to expose aspects
of your process that maybe

444
00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.200
don't work. Sure. Because you
get to see things through

445
00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:35.140
their fresh eyes. Yep. Yeah.
They're going to ask questions

446
00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:38.230
that are, are wide open
and like, wow. I never

447
00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:40.390
thought about that. That does
suck. I don't know why

448
00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:42.760
we do it that way.
Hmm. So yeah. Get an

449
00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:45.160
intern because that involves all
of these things. It involves

450
00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:48.880
community, it involves reading code,
their code, which might not

451
00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:52.420
be good, but it's reading
code, helping them write, teach.

452
00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:55.120
Yeah. That's a, that's a
good all around way. So

453
00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:56.620
I think everyone should run
out and get an intern.

454
00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:59.440
Awesome. Well, you know, we're
just about out of time

455
00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:03.370
here. Any last minute things.
No, I on that list,

456
00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:06.010
I think we covered it.
That sounds like a reading,

457
00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:11.020
writing, speaking community, get an
intern, listen to podcasts, listen

458
00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:14.080
to podcasts. So you knew
that already get on IRC,

459
00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:15.760
get on chat. I'm more
of a Czech guy And

460
00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:19.020
then an IRC guy. But
yeah. Talk, talk, talk, talk,

461
00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:22.050
and talk and listen. All
right, Scott. Thanks a lot.

462
00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:27.180
And we'll see you next
week on Hanselman. <inaudible>.
