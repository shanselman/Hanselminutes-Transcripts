talks with Jeff Atwood on

7
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.230
the future of stack overflow.
Hi, this is Scott Hanselman

8
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.690
and this is another episode
of Hansel minutes. And on

9
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.080
this episode, we've got Jeff
Atwood, Jeff Atwood from coding

10
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.370
horror and from stack overflow.
How's it going? Oh, going

11
00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.700
good. So I've we haven't
been able to get our

12
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.490
fix of the stack overflow
podcast lately. So I figured

13
00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:05.870
we gotta to have you
on this, on this show.

14
00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.600
What's what's going on with
the show? Yeah, this shows

15
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.240
a little bit in limbo.
I think Joel felt like

16
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.150
two things with one. So
Joel Spolsky my business partner

17
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.350
decided that he was sort
of done with blogging after.

18
00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.910
Oh, he doesn't even like
to it a blog because

19
00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.980
he's so old school, but
he's been doing it 10

20
00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.720
years now. And I think
he felt like he had

21
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.300
plateaued. He had done everything
he wanted to do in

22
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.390
that format. And I think
the podcast is a little

23
00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.540
bit of collateral damage. And
also in that we felt

24
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.480
like it was getting a
little tiny bit repetitive that,

25
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.900
you know, so we, we
thought we'd refocus and try

26
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.730
to figure out what the
next thing is for the

27
00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.980
podcast. And we still haven't
really figured that out yet.

28
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.500
So we're working on it,
but it might come back.

29
00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:51.480
It's not dead, but like,
yeah, like, you know, like

30
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.210
a Caterpillar turning into a
butterfly, we're going to turn

31
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.130
into something else. We're not
sure what that something else

32
00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.310
is yet, but we'll see.
Sounds like Joel might be

33
00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.600
tired of being famous. I
think he is definitely a

34
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.570
little tired of being famous
and particularly being famous within

35
00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.620
our little niche of, you
know, technology. I think he,

36
00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.470
he is ready to do
something else. Okay. How long

37
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.360
have you been blogging? He's
been blogging for 10 plus

38
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.110
years. How long when did
you start? I think he,

39
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.260
he started and I think
like 1999 or 2000. And

40
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.060
then I started in, in
2004 about mid 2004, actually.

41
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.880
So essentially we're not that
far apart, but I was

42
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.580
describing it to someone else
and I realized that these

43
00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.410
waves weren't that far apart.
If you look at people

44
00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.860
that were, you know, old
school, you know, OJI, original

45
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.300
bloggers, they started, some of
them started in like in

46
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.280
the nineties, which is amazing,
but a lot of them

47
00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.650
started around the year 2000.
So it was only really

48
00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.870
a four year headstart for
the real leaders that actually

49
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.330
doesn't seem like that much
time in the big scheme

50
00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.030
of things. But it's certainly
much to start now with

51
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.770
a blog than it used
to be. Cause there's so

52
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.530
many more of them. It's
just, it's just crazy how

53
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:11.010
time works. I guess I
used to do a blog

54
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.300
a day. You had like
legendary like tempo. It was

55
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.460
just like every weekday without
fail. There was a blog

56
00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:21.780
post, but, and you'd always
talked about, is it, is

57
00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.880
it more fun to talk
about writing software than writing

58
00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.390
software and then you, you,
you blog less and less,

59
00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.210
I assume, cause you're writing
software now. It's not so

60
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.130
much. So, so really the
work I'm doing with stack

61
00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.310
overflow is very complimentary to
what I write about on

62
00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.120
coding horror. Because when I
sort of went full time

63
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.300
with my blog, one of
the things I said, and

64
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.550
I still believe this is
you can't really just be

65
00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.830
a blogger. That's kind of
boring. You're not really doing

66
00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.200
anything. You're just like a
pundit. So I wanted to

67
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.870
create something and that's something
ended up being core stack

68
00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.360
overflow in the family of
sites around stack overflow. And

69
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.730
I love working on that.
I mean, it's fascinating. I

70
00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.740
enjoy it tremendously, but it
does affect your writing and

71
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.240
not so much the, the,
the fact that I'm writing

72
00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.450
software. So we're running a
business that takes like a

73
00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.990
lot of effort, like just
running a business is, is

74
00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.470
very fatiguing. There's just a
lot of things that have

75
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.560
to go on that aren't
necessarily software that you just

76
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.920
have to get done. And
definitely I, if I had

77
00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.820
to characterize like what, what
takes the most time? It's

78
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.240
just the running a small
business takes a lot of

79
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.090
time. Can't you hire another
small business to do that?

80
00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.280
Like, is it the administrivia
of it? Or what is

81
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.450
it that takes the time?
It's hard to characterize everything

82
00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.370
that takes all the time.
I think it's just really

83
00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.370
well. We did hire a
community moderator. So we have

84
00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.550
a, well, a person whose
full time job. It is

85
00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:47.250
to be a sociologist slash
school principal and, and look

86
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:48.630
at the community and figure
out where it's going and

87
00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.190
things like that. But right
now he's focused on the

88
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.470
stack exchange side because of
all the big changes there.

89
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.740
So that's a help, but
I think also just figuring

90
00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.600
out like, strategy, like what
it is you're doing, like

91
00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.200
where you're going. There's just
a lot of things going

92
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.730
on particularly right now, because
you know, we're, we're taking

93
00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:08.880
a venture capital and there's
a lot of things that

94
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.470
are gonna change about the
company. So what you're now

95
00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.420
public, so that's good. Cause
I can finally talk about

96
00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.990
them. That was really frustrating.
Not being able to talk

97
00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.320
about it and even, well,
technically the venture capital dealer

98
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.260
hasn't closed. We believe it
will soon. I can't say

99
00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.920
who it is and all
that stuff, but so hopefully

100
00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.410
everything within a month or
two, everything will be public

101
00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.540
and sort of back to
normal. I think it's also

102
00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.730
a very hectic time at
the moment. Well, that's cool.

103
00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:34.940
Well, congratulations on the venture
capital and that's a tool.

104
00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.830
That's a good thing, right?
Yeah, we think so. I

105
00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.840
mean, Joel, it's funny for
Joel because Joel had come

106
00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.450
out very anti venture capital
and I was not a

107
00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:46.020
fan of it either, but
what we found was that

108
00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.840
if you want to really
grow, like I like him

109
00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.870
this an SIM city, so
you're playing SIM city. And

110
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:53.760
if you've ever played some
city, there's a point at

111
00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.310
which you're growing your city,
that you need a whole

112
00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.670
bunch of money to just
like just stuff you need

113
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:00.890
stuff to make your city
grow. And it's this weird

114
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:04.580
catch 22 of, without this
infrastructure stuff. I can't bring

115
00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.370
more people in, you know,
and if I don't have

116
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:09.470
the money, I can't get
the people. So like you

117
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:11.660
do the thing, you float
a bond and that's like

118
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.090
he, in every, every game
you'll ever play of some

119
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.490
city, there's some point in
which you find this massive

120
00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:18.800
bond, which is like a
big chunk of money that

121
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.750
you use to build your
city. And then you're just

122
00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.330
assuming that at the end
of this period, when the

123
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.220
bond comes up, you'll have
the money because you'll grow

124
00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.220
to a certain size. So
really it's exactly like that.

125
00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:30.760
So we're really just floating
and blond, a bond of

126
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.650
trying to grow where you
feel like are constraining resources,

127
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:37.010
just not having enough people
to do things. And you

128
00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:39.770
know, people cost money and
that's fine. I'm very happy

129
00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:43.550
to spend money on hiring
great people. It's I love

130
00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:46.100
nothing more than that, rather
than say hardware or whatever,

131
00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.820
which is replaceable, but we're
going to flip this bond

132
00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:52.190
and then, you know, grow
the sites. And then hopefully

133
00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:53.780
at the end of that,
we'll have something large enough

134
00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:57.470
that, you know, the venture
capitalist will at least make

135
00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:01.240
their money back or ideally
make more money back. How

136
00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.230
big do you want to
be? Do you want to

137
00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:05.350
be like a top 10
internet site? Like Wikipedia type

138
00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:10.210
thing? I think we'd be
getting a little too big

139
00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.070
for what we want to
do. I would like to

140
00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:14.740
be quite large because I
think there's certain benefits you

141
00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:17.200
only get at scale. And
when I say quite large,

142
00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.300
I don't mean like all
of the programming because that's

143
00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.730
maybe not a big enough
topic, but I would like

144
00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:25.150
to cover a bunch of
related topics. And that's sort

145
00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:27.460
of what stack exchange 2.0
is about, which is on

146
00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:31.300
blog. That's tech exchange.com. It's
not the top posts anymore,

147
00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:33.730
but it's right under it
where we talked about, we

148
00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:36.100
want to kind of be
like using that 2.0 a

149
00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:39.430
little bit. And the way
I view this as we're

150
00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:41.410
not really, we're not a
nonprofit, I can't say that

151
00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:43.060
we're a nonprofit because we're
not, we are a for

152
00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:46.360
profit company, but I would
like us to really behave

153
00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:49.180
as much as possible, like
a nonprofit. In other words,

154
00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.270
we're trying to build things
that are of general utility

155
00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:58.720
to the internet and actually
provide a better forum for

156
00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.240
people to get information than
what's already out there, not

157
00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.880
just on programming, but a
bunch of other related topics.

158
00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:06.550
And to do that, I
think in a credible way,

159
00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:09.280
I think you have to
get fairly large. You have

160
00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.860
to be, I don't want
to say Facebook size or

161
00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:16.540
Twitter size, but very, very
sizeable. And you know, the

162
00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:18.400
hope is with the venture
capital that we'll have enough

163
00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.800
people to actually cover a
lot of these other topics

164
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:25.120
and make a credible go
at like covering topics and

165
00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.330
on blogs, like stack exchange.com.
If you read through there,

166
00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:30.400
there's like this plan. We're
really, it's when I brought

167
00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:31.900
up some city, it was
for a reason, this is

168
00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:34.660
really like city. This is
like urban planning. We're trying

169
00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:37.930
to build an environment where
people can come and participate

170
00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:42.400
and actually, you know, govern
this area as well. You

171
00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.680
know, we're going to elect
moderators, there's going to be

172
00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:47.650
site founders. You'll of course
get a beta badge for

173
00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:51.430
participating in the beta. And
just the concept that you're

174
00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:53.910
building a community that's self-governing
in a way that using

175
00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:56.670
that kind of wasn't and
in a way that Wikipedia

176
00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:59.310
maybe kind of is as
well. And the thing I

177
00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:02.460
want to avoid is sort
of the Craigslist phenomenon where

178
00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:05.280
Craigslist is this huge, huge
deal. I mean, Craig was,

179
00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:09.900
is enormous and who really
runs Craigslist. You know, it's

180
00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:12.960
not you, it's not me.
It's this cabal of people

181
00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:16.920
at Craigslist, you know? And
there's no, yeah, it's crazy.

182
00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:19.500
But who knows? I mean,
Craig's not Republic about why

183
00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:22.380
they do things, how they
do things and we're trying

184
00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:24.900
to build, and they're for
profit company, they're not a

185
00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:29.280
nonprofit. Right. And I think
we're trying to do a

186
00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.560
little bit more ethically than,
than what Craigslist is doing,

187
00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:36.000
where the community actually has
a say a political, there's

188
00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:40.140
a mini political process of
them running the city. That's

189
00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:44.510
actually documented and okay. Okay.
So I mean, on Craigslist,

190
00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:47.150
certainly the community owns the
content, but you're saying they

191
00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:48.890
don't own the direction of
the site. They don't own

192
00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:51.020
the functionality of the site
and you want to have

193
00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:54.830
the community owned, both the
content and the direction. That's

194
00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:57.470
right. That's right. Definitely. I
mean, there'll be certain city

195
00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:59.420
planners that you work with
figuring out like what you

196
00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:03.770
want for your community. And
you know, there's things it's

197
00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:05.240
still a Q and a
type format. I mean, it

198
00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:06.980
has to sit within our
format, but I think there's

199
00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:09.080
a, there's going to be
a lot of flexibility. I

200
00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:13.940
think QA is such a
large set of functionality that

201
00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:16.340
I think you can cover
a lot of communities, but

202
00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:18.290
I really want it to
be, you know, of the

203
00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:20.680
community by the community, for
the community and our, our

204
00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:23.450
top line goal. The thing
that Joel and I agree

205
00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:26.270
on just intimately is that
we want to make the

206
00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:28.160
internet better. We're not going
to do anything. That's going

207
00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.890
to damage the fabric of
the internet. The whole purpose

208
00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:34.640
of this exercise is to
get better information on the

209
00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:38.630
internet faster so that people
can follow your trail of

210
00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:42.710
breadcrumbs. And actually, you know,
the next future traveler to

211
00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:46.460
happen upon your question will
get an answer immediately. Cause

212
00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:49.790
it's already there. And you
know, the principle of just

213
00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:51.350
being able to share your
knowledge, show off what you

214
00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:54.080
know, which programmers love. I
mean, programmers love nothing more

215
00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:56.780
than telling you what they
know and how they did

216
00:10:56.780 --> 00:11:00.020
things. And, and that's great
because you know, other programmers

217
00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:02.150
benefit from that. This is
how this is how young

218
00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:06.560
programmers become better. You know,
older, talented programmers is they

219
00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:09.380
learn from us. So if
we're not out there, you

220
00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:11.540
know, putting these public artifacts
on the internet for people

221
00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:13.790
to follow and look at
and learn from then, you're

222
00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:17.900
not really advancing the craft
of programming, right? I mean,

223
00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:19.730
how many people can you
mentor on a one to

224
00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:22.880
one basis? Probably not many,
but through the internet. And

225
00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:25.010
you know, you could mentor
programmers all over the world,

226
00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:28.820
these little nuggets of information
you're leaving on stack overflow.

227
00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:30.800
So we want to extend
that model to, you know,

228
00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:35.060
as many topics as it
fits. We realized that QA

229
00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:38.540
may or may not fit
for some topics. So we

230
00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:40.220
don't have to own the
world. And that sense I'm

231
00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:42.500
not going to force a
fit. And in fact, this

232
00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:46.070
process that's described on the
stack exchange blog, we're actually

233
00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:48.050
going to shut down the
site. If they don't reach

234
00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:50.630
a certain size or a
certain critical mass, we're going

235
00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:52.700
to actually, rather than have
all these ghost towns of

236
00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:55.420
just, you know, not enough
information, we're actually going to

237
00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:58.000
shut the site down, archive
the information so anybody can

238
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.970
get to it. Cause everything
we do is, is creative

239
00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:04.990
commons. So it's always available.
It's never destroyed. And then

240
00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:06.850
we'll just close down the
site. Cause we'd rather a

241
00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:10.630
ghost town is a net
negative for the internet because

242
00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:13.330
it draws occasionally someone will
get sucked in there. It's

243
00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:15.520
like, Oh look, there's a
place where there's information, but

244
00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:17.260
it's really a ghost town.
There's nobody there. There's nobody

245
00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.590
answering questions. You know, it's
just not really a functioning

246
00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:22.780
community. It's like driving through
the bad part of town.

247
00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:25.750
You know, we're not going
to leave that up. So

248
00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:27.850
as part of our urban
planning mission, we were just

249
00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:31.240
going to raise the ears
of the town that, that

250
00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:35.170
aren't working and rebuild them
as something else. So we're

251
00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:37.780
not shy about turning things
off. It's not working either.

252
00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:40.860
What about turning? What about
turning things on? What about

253
00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:43.110
adding things? I mean, you're
saying like meant you're using

254
00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:46.770
words like mentorship and learning,
but the sites primarily focused

255
00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:52.170
around targeted answers, targeted answers
to targeted questions. Well, but

256
00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:53.940
how do you learn? I
mean, you look at the

257
00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:57.780
Socratic method, right? It's like
to ask questions, you know,

258
00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:01.050
of your teacher. And I
think Q and a is

259
00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:03.210
an, is an outstanding format
for learning. I've had so

260
00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:05.760
many people tell me on
stack overflow that they learned

261
00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:09.210
Ruby from answering questions on
stack overflow life. It's actually,

262
00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:11.940
didn't never even occurred to
me, but I was at

263
00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:13.830
the dev days in LA
and this guy came up

264
00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:15.660
to me and I've had
a number of people since

265
00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:19.620
then. Tell me how they
act, actively learn new topics

266
00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:22.470
in this format. Which surprised
me a little bit, because

267
00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:24.540
I think you can learn.
My view was of course

268
00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:27.300
you're learning, but I viewed
it as learning within your

269
00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:29.520
existing discipline. I learned something
new about, you know, C

270
00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:31.920
sharp, which is what I
use, but they were actually

271
00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:35.370
learning completely unrelated programming languages
by like trying to answer

272
00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:38.070
these people's questions and figuring
out what it took to

273
00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:41.430
answer these questions. So you're
saying like, like newbies answering

274
00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:46.050
other newbies questions about language
that they don't speak Pretty

275
00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:49.200
much. I know it's surprising.
Right. But I think, yeah,

276
00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:53.100
it actually worked that way.
I never predicted that particularly

277
00:13:53.100 --> 00:14:00.120
is Wow. That is interesting.
Yeah. Huh. Wait, wait, you

278
00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:02.040
asked a question about how
these sites will get formed.

279
00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:04.470
So again, we're getting a
lot of inspiration from, from

280
00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:07.950
using that, not entirely, but
like are one of the

281
00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:10.080
top lines is maybe we're
trying to be used at

282
00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:12.780
2.0 and in a, in
a small, on a smaller

283
00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:16.140
scale than, than using it.
And, and the way topics

284
00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:18.510
are gonna get formed is
there's this there's this other

285
00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:21.780
site you'll go to, we
haven't come up with a

286
00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:23.280
really good name for this
yet, but let's call it

287
00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:26.490
new sites. So you go
to the new sites site

288
00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:31.440
and you'll propose, there should
be a stack overflow like

289
00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:35.760
site on, I don't know
dogs. So you'd say I'm

290
00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:37.980
proposing. We have a stack
overflow in dogs. So you

291
00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:40.620
have to come up with
a paragraph describing what it

292
00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:42.990
is. Okay. So it's like
for dogs, just talk about

293
00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:46.290
dog breeding and talk about
dog, grooming anything about dogs.

294
00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:50.040
And then you have to
come up with five representative

295
00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:53.360
questions that will be on
for this site and five

296
00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:56.240
questions that will be off
topic for this site. And

297
00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:58.760
I mean off topic in
a subtle way, not, you

298
00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:02.000
know, aren't cats. Awesome. You
know, I mean, or why

299
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.310
is the sky blue? It's
gotta be some subtle thing.

300
00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:07.250
That's about dogs, but it's
not really about dogs enough

301
00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:10.640
to be on, on topic.
Because what we found is

302
00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:12.620
one of the biggest challenges
for a community is you

303
00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:14.480
have to define the boundaries
of that community. It's like,

304
00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:17.840
what, what, what, what do
we love and what do

305
00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:19.820
we hate? So that's, to
me, that's what defines the

306
00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:22.400
community. You love the same
things and you hate the

307
00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:25.880
same things. So for programmers,
it's that we love code,

308
00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:29.030
you know, and it doesn't
really matter what language it

309
00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:30.380
is. You know what I
mean? I think that's a

310
00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:33.260
false assumption. A lot of,
a lot of people made

311
00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.720
about programmers. Like, Oh, there
should be a C sharp

312
00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:39.410
site because the.net guys hate
the Java guys. And on

313
00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:41.990
stack overflow, we realize that's
not really true, good programmers

314
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:44.390
know more than one language.
And they don't hate people

315
00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:47.060
that use a different language.
Cause that's stupid, right? Because

316
00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:49.970
our shared goal is like,
let's write awesome code. That

317
00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:52.910
does cool stuff. That's what
we love. And the thing

318
00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:56.210
that we hate as programmers
is bad code, you know,

319
00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:58.460
code that just makes you
cry. You know that you

320
00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:00.320
have to maintain this. This
guy had no idea what

321
00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:02.360
he's doing. He wrote this
terrible code that makes your

322
00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:04.490
life miserable. That's what you
want to get rid of.

323
00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:06.980
Right? And that's where the
learning vector comes in. Ideally,

324
00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:08.810
you want to teach these
bad programmers, the ones that

325
00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:11.300
can be reached, you want
to teach them how to

326
00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:12.980
do a better, so they're
not creating all this bad

327
00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:16.040
code. That's one that's cleaned
up. So with programmers, we

328
00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.570
know we know what they
love and we know what

329
00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:19.130
they hate because I mean,
I'm a programmer, you're a

330
00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:22.250
programmer. This is easy right
now for topics that like

331
00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:25.760
dogs, it's like, okay, you
know what a dog lovers

332
00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:28.610
love, you know, and what
do they hate? And I

333
00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:30.980
think the, what do they
hate part gets difficult because

334
00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:35.300
I think dog, you know,
you'd have to, you have

335
00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:37.820
to define it. And if
you don't define the boundaries

336
00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:40.100
of the community, then the
community kind of falls apart

337
00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:42.440
because it's either too general.
In which case these people

338
00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:46.190
have nothing really in common
or there's people who don't

339
00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:48.680
like each other on the
same site or have like

340
00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:52.490
totally radically different interests. Like
one thing that came up

341
00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:54.680
when we were at fog
Creek, we're in New York for

342
00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.330
a week trying to figure
out what it is we're

343
00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:59.420
doing. I was talking to
Michael Pryor, who is Joel's

344
00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:04.190
business partner. And he's a
big aquarium guy. He's a

345
00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:06.740
big aquarium hobbyist. And he
was mentioning to me that

346
00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:10.280
there should be an aquarium
site, perhaps that's something we

347
00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:12.950
can put together. And when
I was talking to Michael,

348
00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:14.840
I was like, Oh yeah,
cool. Everybody who loves aquariums

349
00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:16.280
could be on the site.
And he said, no, no,

350
00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:17.720
no, no. It was like,
no, no, no, not the

351
00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:20.600
freshwater people. The freshwater people
have to can't be on

352
00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:25.910
our site because apparently in
aquariums, there's freshwater and saltwater.

353
00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:28.520
And so order is like
way harder. That's like, like

354
00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:31.520
science. And like, it's just,
I don't know anything about

355
00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:33.530
aquariums, but from what he
was telling me, it's like,

356
00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:37.190
it's just this whole different
world. And they don't want

357
00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:39.110
to say despise is not
the right word, but they

358
00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:41.600
have no respect for the
freshwater Korean people because they,

359
00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:43.760
Michael said, yeah, it was
a freshwater. You just throw

360
00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:45.410
some water in a bucket
and you throw some fish

361
00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:47.600
in and you're done, you
know, it's really, there's nothing

362
00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:50.490
to it. It's it's silly.
You know? So you could

363
00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:52.170
make the case that if
you start an aquarium site,

364
00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:54.840
I didn't know that, but
this is something we want

365
00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:57.240
to figure out as part
of this process is when

366
00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:59.760
you start this aquarium site,
the off topic questions would

367
00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:02.670
be, Oh, this is a
freshwater aquarium question. This doesn't

368
00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:05.190
belong here because this is
a site for people who

369
00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:10.500
love saltwater aquariums. So we
have to figure out in

370
00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:12.990
advance. Yeah. And we didn't
really do a good job

371
00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:15.060
of that on, we did
an okay job on stack

372
00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:17.880
overflow, but we moved into
server fault and super user.

373
00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:19.650
I don't think we did
a very good job of

374
00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:22.680
deciding ahead of time, you
know, which questions would be,

375
00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:24.450
you know, how do we
map the boundaries of this

376
00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:28.470
and having concrete examples of
specific questions that people ask

377
00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:31.050
that are either on or
off topic for the site.

378
00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:32.640
So that's step one is
to come up with this

379
00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:35.910
proposal with 10 questions, you
know, five on five off

380
00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:38.010
the topic, and then people
will sort of vote on

381
00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:40.710
those and say, which ones
do you like? Those will

382
00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:42.450
get sorted, of course, like
on stack overflow and go

383
00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:45.690
to the top. And then
there's a phase two where

384
00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:48.030
you actually commit to the
size. You can only commit

385
00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:50.370
to one site per cycle
and you have to have

386
00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:52.710
reputation within the stack overflow
system to do some of

387
00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:55.920
this. But we will allow
people from just random internet.

388
00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:59.130
People contribute to this as
well. There's this weighting system.

389
00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:01.620
So if you're say John
skeet, who happens to be

390
00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:05.490
the number one user on
stack overflow, your contribution, when

391
00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:07.470
you say I commit to
the site that carries a

392
00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:09.810
lot of weight because we
know a couple things about

393
00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:12.510
you. We know, Hey, you're
an experienced user. You have

394
00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:16.080
lots of reputation. The, you
have a track record of

395
00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:18.960
precinct, really, really good content
that other people loaded up.

396
00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:23.220
And, and probably just, you
know, LUNGevity, you've been around

397
00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:27.240
awhile. So your vote will
carry more weight, but you

398
00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:29.970
know, random anonymous internet users
can vote as well. Their

399
00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:31.860
vote will be like a
fraction of John skeeves, but

400
00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:34.980
if there's enough of them,
there's a little meter, you

401
00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:36.570
know, what's the Y YMCA,
when they're doing this fun

402
00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:39.000
drive, they have a thermometer
like, Oh, we're raising money,

403
00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:42.510
you know, 10,000, 20,000, 30,000,
there's a giant thermometer for

404
00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:44.700
each one of these sites.
And as people commit to

405
00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:47.310
them, remember, you can only
commit to one site per

406
00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:49.380
cycle. So you can't commit
to five or six things.

407
00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:51.150
Cause we think that's ridiculous.
It's like, are you really

408
00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:56.840
going to go to six
different sites? Hey, it's alternate

409
00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:00.320
universe, Scott Hanselman going to
thank our sponsors for making

410
00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:02.390
this free show possible. We've
been doing Hansel minutes for

411
00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:04.340
almost four years now and
we really couldn't do it

412
00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:06.260
without tolerance. So I wanna
tell you about some of

413
00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:08.720
the stuff they're working on.
If you've already started developing

414
00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:11.720
with Silverlight, then now you
probably need a solid testing

415
00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:14.360
tool to do your serval
at UIs. Unfortunately, though, a

416
00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:16.430
lot of the tools available
today only help you with

417
00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:18.980
unit testing. There's not really
a good way to simulate

418
00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:21.650
the actual behavior of those
end users, unless you spend

419
00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:24.140
days and weeks doing a
lot of manual testing, but

420
00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:26.120
the guys at Tellerik, you've
got a new point, click

421
00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:29.420
UI testing tool for server
Silverlight called web UI test

422
00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:32.330
studio. The beauty is that
you can quickly record your

423
00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:35.900
tests with a cross-browser recorder.
You can enrich them with

424
00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:38.750
code. If you've got really
complex scenarios. And on top

425
00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:40.910
of that, it supports all
the standard controls as well

426
00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:44.120
as the Tellerik enhanced controls.
You can verify not only

427
00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:48.280
several life, but even complex
Ajax applications, best part web

428
00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:50.830
UI test studio lives in
visual studio. So you don't

429
00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:53.890
have to leave your favorite
development environment. You check it

430
00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:58.780
out at telerik.com/web hyphen testing,
hyphen tools, and be sure

431
00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:01.090
to thank Tellerik for supporting
the show on their Facebook

432
00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:05.280
fan page at facebook.com/telerik. I
mean, it may be the

433
00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:06.960
John skeet is really into
it. Let's go back to

434
00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:09.570
our aquariums example. Maybe John
skeet is really into salt

435
00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:11.940
water aquarium. I didn't know
that. I mean, programmers have

436
00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:14.160
a lot of really cool
interests. I mean, we're just

437
00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:18.600
talking about smart people who
do interesting stuff, so he

438
00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:20.580
might have that interest. So
he would commit to that

439
00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:24.090
in the cycle. And then
as the thermometer fills up,

440
00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:26.670
eventually you reach a threshold
and those are the sites

441
00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:29.850
that actually go into beta.
And you know how you

442
00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:33.480
have a beta site, there's
a private beta people feed

443
00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:35.490
it. And then there's a
public beta. It's very much

444
00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:38.220
like the process we did
when we launched server fault

445
00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:39.960
and super user, we had
this process, but it was

446
00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:41.790
a very ad hoc process
that we just came up

447
00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:43.620
with like, Oh, we should
have a beta. We should

448
00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:46.050
have a private beta. We
should have a public beta.

449
00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:47.760
We should come up with
a logo. We should come

450
00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:49.770
up with the name, all
this stuff that we were

451
00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:51.510
doing in an ad hoc
way is going to be

452
00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:55.260
documented and sort of, I
don't wanna say formalized to

453
00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:58.020
some extent complicated, but it
will walk you through the

454
00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:00.690
process of doing this. And
it's the community deciding, you

455
00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:02.580
know, rather than us sitting
in a room saying, what

456
00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:05.040
should we have new sites
on the community can actually

457
00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:08.430
decide what new sites there
need to be. And then

458
00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:11.640
over time, our hope is
my hope is I talked

459
00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:14.340
about the technical ghetto that
I feel like we're sometimes

460
00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:17.070
in a, as we take
baby steps. Okay. So we

461
00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:19.680
start with stack overflow, you
have a programmer that loves

462
00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:22.470
aquariums. So that programmer would
vote for the salt water

463
00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:24.570
cream site and participate on
it. And hopefully it would

464
00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:27.630
do well and succeed. And
then in the next cycle,

465
00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:30.240
somebody on the aquarium site,
maybe they're not even a

466
00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:32.400
program or maybe they found
us through, you know, an

467
00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:34.080
internet search and like, Oh
wow, this is a great

468
00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:37.500
site for saltwater aquarium. And
it's just like myself, that

469
00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:39.810
person would have another shared
interest. Let's say, you know,

470
00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:43.110
dogs, that's a simple one.
And then that person not

471
00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:46.950
even being a programmer would
then vote for launching a

472
00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:49.140
dog site. I mean, that's,
that's the hope is that

473
00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:52.410
we're going to take these
baby steps outside the technical

474
00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:55.920
ghetto and actually eventually maybe
bring in people that, you

475
00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:58.320
know, aren't technical at all,
but, but are willing to

476
00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:01.410
participate in this sort of
democratic process of how should

477
00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:04.800
we launch these sites if
you like this format and

478
00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:07.170
you think it works well,
what other topics would you

479
00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:10.500
like there to be? And
that you would actively participate

480
00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:14.580
in the old SAC exchange
model was, you know, pay

481
00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:16.820
us $129 a month and
you can watch this bet

482
00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:19.550
on any topic. But what
we found was that, and

483
00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:21.930
I guess I've always known
this is that money is

484
00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:25.200
like not really a good
glue for sticking people together.

485
00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:29.190
The glue that sticks people
together is shared love of

486
00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:34.890
a topic and yeah, they
weren't really poised for success.

487
00:23:35.850 --> 00:23:38.700
Well, yeah, they weren't really
poised for success. Joel has

488
00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:41.040
a nice little Venn diagram
on the blog entry on

489
00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:43.200
blog that stack exchange a
com the documents is like,

490
00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:45.230
okay, you have the intersection
of people who have hundred

491
00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:47.990
$29 a month who have
the ability to bring in

492
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:50.360
an audience. And there's like
two of the things, and

493
00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:53.270
this success is like this
tiny little sliver of a

494
00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:57.380
Venn diagram, right? So our
hope is to widen that

495
00:23:57.380 --> 00:23:59.570
Venn diagram to make it
so that communities can actually

496
00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:02.570
be successful because we'll be
supporting you, we'll be helping

497
00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:05.780
you drive traffic to the
sites. We'll provide experienced users

498
00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:08.270
that are interested in the
topic and the goal isn't

499
00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:10.880
to make money, because that's
just a tough goal to

500
00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:13.790
get people behind. Because I
mean, that's not really my

501
00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:17.000
goal. You know, it's like,
it's shared love of the

502
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.630
topic and that, you know,
we're producing better information on

503
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:23.900
this topic for the entire
internet to benefit from. And

504
00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:26.210
we learned from it, you
know, to me, what motivates

505
00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:27.710
me is that I get
excited about it. I just

506
00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:30.410
love to learn about a
topic like I love to

507
00:24:30.410 --> 00:24:33.170
learn. And I love to
share my information, share information

508
00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:34.790
about that topic with other
people in a way that,

509
00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:37.700
you know, you have this
nice virtuous cycle going, you

510
00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:39.770
know, I help you, you
help me. And we're both

511
00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:42.080
learning. That's awesome. It's like
everyday I learned more stuff.

512
00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:44.090
And I think those are
the types of people. We

513
00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:46.550
want to attract people that
are really interested in sharing

514
00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:48.500
their knowledge about the topic
and learning from others about

515
00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:51.080
it. And that's the loop
that we want to close.

516
00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:54.110
And, you know, although we
are a for profit company,

517
00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:56.780
I've been basically just saying,
it's like, I want to

518
00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:59.300
run very, very similarly to
a nonprofit in a sense

519
00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:01.970
that what, I'm very clear
that, you know, we have

520
00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:04.040
to have money to run
as a business, but the

521
00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:07.070
top line goal is to
make the internet better and

522
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:10.220
to provide better places, to
get information about these things

523
00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:15.170
that you love and to
share it. So it's a

524
00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:17.240
little bit of a religious
mission for me, but I

525
00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:19.880
feel like that's, that's what
I've seen work on the

526
00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:22.940
internet. And that's, those are
the communities that I love.

527
00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:24.350
And that's the kind of
thing that I want to

528
00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:26.720
be a part of. So,
I mean, we'll see where

529
00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:29.380
it goes, but that's, that's
the current plan. Let me

530
00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:33.700
ask you this. There are
the, the, the information dense

531
00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:37.060
homepage of stack overflow and
the kind of like intense

532
00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:41.410
focus on the minutia of
statistics is attractive for a

533
00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:46.030
nerd, but for a someone
doing cross stitching, that might

534
00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:48.880
be pretty scary. And they
might jump on the site

535
00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:51.100
and go, ah, where, you
know, what, what, what weird

536
00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:55.030
corner of the internet have
I come upon? Well, you

537
00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:58.240
know, forums sites and kind
of PHB, there might be

538
00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:02.080
an existing cross stitching or,
or a saltwater aquarium site,

539
00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:04.150
but it also has got
to like a nice skin

540
00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:06.220
on it. That's more than
just changing the color and

541
00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:09.670
adding a logo. Is there,
there may be a huge

542
00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:12.910
community that wants a stack
overflow like Q and a

543
00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:14.770
site, but they would like
it to look like their

544
00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:17.700
site. Is that, is that
possible? Or we'll stack overflow

545
00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:22.090
always look like kind of
a car dashboard? Well, I

546
00:26:22.090 --> 00:26:23.890
think you have to quantify,
there's, there's really a couple

547
00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:27.220
of key pages on stack
overflow. It's kinda depressing from

548
00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:29.260
a coding perspective cause we've
spent all this time working

549
00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:31.090
on it and you realize
on stack overflow is basically

550
00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:34.960
like five pages on the
entire site, but five really

551
00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:39.400
awesome pages, right? So there's
the user page that describes

552
00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:41.410
who user is, what questions
they have, all that stuff.

553
00:26:41.410 --> 00:26:45.060
Do you have your user
page, the homepage big and

554
00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:49.530
then question pages. So really
actually there's, there's more actually,

555
00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:52.320
but those three are pretty
much the backbone of the

556
00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:55.020
site. So I don't think
the question page itself is

557
00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:58.290
that intimidating. So when people
talk about this and I

558
00:26:58.290 --> 00:27:01.050
agree that the homepage is
very dense, but by design,

559
00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:04.410
the question page is nothing
intimidating. That's where most people

560
00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:06.300
will end up because Google
is not going to send

561
00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:08.520
you to the homepage, you
know, or whatever web search

562
00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:09.780
engine you use. It's not
going to send you the

563
00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:11.580
homepage. It's going to send
you to some page that

564
00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:13.830
has the answer to some
question that you, that you

565
00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:16.530
typed into a search box
on a web search page.

566
00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:21.210
I don't think that page
is really that intimidating. So

567
00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:22.830
I think it's a little
bit of an unfair comparison.

568
00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:26.910
Now, the homepage I'll admit
it's very dense, but the

569
00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:32.100
goal of the homepage, it's
almost like Wikipedia, where how

570
00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:34.080
many people do you know
that actually edit a Wikipedia

571
00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:35.910
page? You know, we make
a lot of noise about

572
00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:37.530
how great it is that
look P is the shared

573
00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:42.600
thing. And the actual, the
actual editing of a Wikipedia

574
00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:47.640
page is very, very intimidating,
extremely. So it kind of

575
00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:49.350
freaks me out and I'm
a programmer, right? It's like,

576
00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:51.210
well, how do I do
this? And we're, you know,

577
00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:53.970
I click edit. And then
I have this incredibly complicated

578
00:27:53.970 --> 00:27:58.680
process. I don't think our
homepage is, is that it's

579
00:27:58.680 --> 00:27:59.910
okay for the homepage to
be a bit of a

580
00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:02.070
barrier. So when you, when
you come on the homepage,

581
00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:06.090
you should be inundated with
information about, okay, this is

582
00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:08.340
what this is about. You
know, here's a bunch of

583
00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:11.760
questions. Here's the topics, which
is the tags. The homepage

584
00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:13.590
has really, you're not supposed
to understand it. The only

585
00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:15.390
thing the homepage is supposed
to do you say, wow,

586
00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:17.280
this is a place where
there's a lot of X

587
00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:20.640
and we're X. And if
X is something that you're

588
00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:23.640
like, wow, I really love
X. Then, then that's good.

589
00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:25.500
Right? You should be hanging
out there and you should

590
00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:27.780
like click through. Well, that's
an interesting question. That's interesting

591
00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:30.540
question. That's an interesting question.
I wonder if anybody has

592
00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:35.490
answered this and I don't
think it's actually that much

593
00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:38.970
more dense than the average
bulletin board page. The average

594
00:28:38.970 --> 00:28:41.130
and bulletin board page is
actually quite dense with a

595
00:28:41.130 --> 00:28:48.780
lot of really incidental information.
So that all that said,

596
00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:51.990
we are open to CSS,
skinning of the sites. Every

597
00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:55.140
site that we launched should
have a somewhat unique look,

598
00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:58.230
not entirely. I mean, there's
like a Joel, this is

599
00:28:58.230 --> 00:29:00.240
maybe not the best analogy
in the world, but you

600
00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:02.400
know, the dummies books, you
have those have a certain

601
00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:04.590
look, you know, every time
you go to a bookstore,

602
00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:06.240
it's like, Oh, that's a
dummies book, right? Because it

603
00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:08.100
has that yellow thing. And
it's got that guy with

604
00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:11.460
the chalkboard or whatever. We
wouldn't want to have some

605
00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:14.880
recognizability to the brand so
people can recognize, okay, you're

606
00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:18.030
a screwdriver. You look like
a screwdriver. So we're not

607
00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:21.030
going to switch it up.
So radically, the people can't

608
00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:24.270
tell, Oh, this is a
stack overflow family site, but

609
00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:26.520
doing stuff like turning off
the views columns, you're like,

610
00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:28.620
okay, now there's too much
numbers on this page for

611
00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:30.780
this one site. I don't
want the views column to

612
00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:33.300
be visible. There are stack
exchange sites that have already

613
00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:36.780
done this. So, and we
have two designers now going

614
00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:39.720
through doing a CSS, Zen
garden type of exercise with

615
00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:45.430
us where they're producing five
CSS skins, each other, that

616
00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:48.310
we can then use as
a palette for launching new

617
00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:51.070
sites, like, okay, we have
these 10 CSS designs or

618
00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:54.610
you can create your own,
you know, so, so we

619
00:29:54.610 --> 00:29:56.260
do want to give people
a menu of sorts so

620
00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:57.850
they can make the site
look kind of like what

621
00:29:57.850 --> 00:30:00.700
they want, but we do
want to have a consistent

622
00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:03.220
theme within the, within the,
the network of like, okay,

623
00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:09.280
it's recognizably a, a stack
site. Right? So I think

624
00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:12.420
those are really the two
goals At two questions. Then

625
00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:16.170
one, I think I'm thinking
of my, my, my dad

626
00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:20.850
as being kind of a
surprisingly typical internet user in

627
00:30:20.850 --> 00:30:22.830
that I went over to
his house and set up

628
00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:26.310
his browser and basically putting
like a bookmark bar. And

629
00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:29.400
I put in like the
five sites that he visits.

630
00:30:30.030 --> 00:30:33.180
So well for one level
of internet user, you know,

631
00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:36.300
Google or a search engine
is there on ramp to

632
00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:41.760
the internet. I'm realizing that
a surprisingly massive number of

633
00:30:42.270 --> 00:30:45.000
people don't use Google that
much. They have they've they've,

634
00:30:45.090 --> 00:30:48.000
they've used it before. They've
picked their sites and now

635
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.340
they have their sites and
their on ramp to the

636
00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:52.740
inner map. And their internet
is a favorites bar, a

637
00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:56.160
bookmark bar, or some links
somewhere. My dad visits five

638
00:30:56.160 --> 00:31:00.000
websites. Sadly one of them
is mine, but he does

639
00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.080
like traditional. He does traditional
bow hunting and archery, like

640
00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:06.570
the way the native Americans
did it. So he has

641
00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:09.720
like three websites. He visits
that are like, go out

642
00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:12.060
into the woods, find a
tree, cut the tree up

643
00:31:12.090 --> 00:31:13.830
and come out with a
bow and arrow. And it

644
00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:16.590
takes like seven weeks and
a bunch of lacquer. And

645
00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:19.440
it's an incredibly complicated thing.
It's, it's a lot like

646
00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:22.920
saltwater aquariums. And I think
that would be like, that's

647
00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:27.150
cool. It would be ideal
for what you're doing, but,

648
00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:30.570
but knowing these guys, and
these are like, these are

649
00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:32.760
like mustache people. And you
know what I mean by

650
00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:38.790
that, like you're in America,
you're your generation is defined

651
00:31:38.790 --> 00:31:41.130
by, you know, the thickness
and quality of your mustache.

652
00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:45.750
And these gentlemen all looked
like Magnum PI, you know

653
00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:48.030
what I'm saying? If you
decide to rock a stash,

654
00:31:48.030 --> 00:31:51.000
that's that thick and wonderful,
you know, you're either a

655
00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.590
civil war reenactor or you're
like in your sixties, so

656
00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:58.870
I totally get it. Okay,
good. So these are those,

657
00:31:58.870 --> 00:32:02.730
these are those guys. Those
guys could not absorb just

658
00:32:02.730 --> 00:32:06.180
because it's generational. I'm not
saying they're older, smarter, not

659
00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:09.600
smarter. They're just different people.
They could never absorb. I

660
00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:11.400
think the amount of information
you have on the homepage

661
00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:14.670
of stack overflow. So it
would be interesting to see,

662
00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.580
like, to, to optimize what
a, what a stack overflow

663
00:32:18.030 --> 00:32:21.780
site would look like for
that, for the folks like

664
00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:25.320
that. And then my second
kind of half, half question

665
00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:28.320
related is a lot of
times they're just kind of

666
00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:32.490
just chatting. They're just talking,
where would, where would just

667
00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:36.780
talking? I mean, is every,
is every discussion started by

668
00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:40.460
a question? I guess there's
mine. My medic question there.

669
00:32:42.370 --> 00:32:44.650
Yeah. So, so I think,
let me answer your two

670
00:32:44.650 --> 00:32:47.620
part questions. So I think
it's our hope that we

671
00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:50.200
eventually get out of the
engineering ghetto, although we love

672
00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:53.620
engineers. That's great. Eventually we
want to take enough baby

673
00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:56.230
steps that we actually get
to, you know, the I'm

674
00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:59.170
going to make my own
bow enthusiasts site. That's awesome

675
00:32:59.170 --> 00:33:01.720
because I mean, our goal
is really to support communities

676
00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:03.160
like that. As long as
there's enough people to reach

677
00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:05.350
a little mini critical mass
and it doesn't have to

678
00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:07.150
be thousands of people, it
could be a few hundred

679
00:33:07.150 --> 00:33:10.360
that really love it. That's
fine. I don't think he

680
00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:12.130
would spend a ton of
time on the homepage. I

681
00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:14.680
mean, generally you're drilling through
pretty rapidly to the question.

682
00:33:14.770 --> 00:33:16.660
I mean, the question pages
are the meat of the

683
00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:19.860
site, the front page is
just, you know, you know,

684
00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:21.460
it's trying to show you
a veneer of like, okay,

685
00:33:21.490 --> 00:33:23.980
this is the boundaries of
the topics that we're talking

686
00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:25.780
about. So you can get
a sense of, am I

687
00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:27.730
in the right place? Am
I in like a biker

688
00:33:27.730 --> 00:33:30.850
bar? You know, where everybody's
looking at me? Like, what

689
00:33:30.850 --> 00:33:33.610
are you doing here? And
if I'm not a biker,

690
00:33:33.610 --> 00:33:35.410
you know, that's, that's the
way it should be looking

691
00:33:35.410 --> 00:33:37.120
at me. Right. So that's
actually kind of, okay, it's

692
00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:39.310
actually okay for it to
be a little intimidating because

693
00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:41.380
you want the right people
to stay. You know, the

694
00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:44.110
people that love, you know,
hand building these bows spending

695
00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:47.050
weeks, lacquering it, that's your
people, right? Those are the

696
00:33:47.050 --> 00:33:49.120
people that you want to
not be intimidated. Like, Oh,

697
00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:51.430
I, I I've spent weeks
building this. Doesn't intimidate me

698
00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:53.170
in the slightest. When you
see a question that says,

699
00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:58.120
how many months should I
be working on my heel

700
00:33:58.150 --> 00:34:00.970
on my bow, that should,
that would scare away a

701
00:34:00.970 --> 00:34:04.150
normal person. And that's good.
Right? So that's, that's my

702
00:34:04.150 --> 00:34:06.190
part, answer to that. It's
meant to be a tiny

703
00:34:06.190 --> 00:34:09.580
bit intimidating until you drill
through the question page. And

704
00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:13.390
then as for the, the
second part of your question,

705
00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:19.120
which I think I've already
forgotten, can you, Sometimes people

706
00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:22.240
just want to talk and
these guys will just talk.

707
00:34:22.390 --> 00:34:24.010
And like an example of
talking to you would be

708
00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:26.890
on the, on, on thinking
about all these hobbies, right?

709
00:34:26.890 --> 00:34:28.660
There's a million hobbyists out
there that have a million

710
00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:31.660
hobbies and sometimes they just
want to post pictures of

711
00:34:31.660 --> 00:34:34.090
them. So it's like, Hey,
here's this Bo I've been

712
00:34:34.090 --> 00:34:36.070
working on. Here's the story
about how I made it?

713
00:34:36.070 --> 00:34:39.190
What do you think? And
then people will talk and

714
00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:42.250
on stack overflow, if I
posted a question, said, here's

715
00:34:42.250 --> 00:34:43.960
this program I've been working
on, here's the code? What

716
00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:47.050
do you think I'd be
like immediately, you know, shot.

717
00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:49.150
And they would tell me
that I was off topic,

718
00:34:50.770 --> 00:34:55.330
Right? So there's definitely a
tension there. It's definitely a

719
00:34:55.330 --> 00:34:59.230
by design thing that we
discourage sort of arbitrary discussion

720
00:34:59.290 --> 00:35:02.830
because Robert Scoble had a
really good post where he

721
00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:09.010
documented exactly why this is,
because if there's too much,

722
00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:11.170
you want some discussion, but
not too much, because if

723
00:35:11.170 --> 00:35:14.560
there's too much discussion, you're
not really learning anymore. You're

724
00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:17.380
just a couple of guys
hanging out, shooting the shooting,

725
00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:20.200
the breeze. And there's nothing
wrong with that. But if

726
00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:22.210
your goal is like, look,
I want to get really

727
00:35:22.210 --> 00:35:24.580
good at building these Wells.
That's my number one goal

728
00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:28.120
is to like build my
bow. Then that kind of

729
00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:30.790
starts harming the mission at
some point. And I think

730
00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:33.160
that's one of the big
problems with existing discussion boards

731
00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:35.920
is they make it so
easy to fall into that

732
00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:38.340
trap of like you, a
couple of people just shooting

733
00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:41.550
the breeze and the information,
the signal to noise ratio

734
00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:44.610
goes in the wrong direction.
Like a lot, like very,

735
00:35:44.610 --> 00:35:49.350
very far in the wrong
direction. So we unapologetically optimize

736
00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:51.960
for information where you say,
look, unless it's a question

737
00:35:52.770 --> 00:35:56.550
about the topics, it can
have a reasonable answer, then

738
00:35:56.730 --> 00:35:59.640
we don't think you should
ask it. Now, this is

739
00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:02.970
definitely frustrating for certain people
because you certainly on stack

740
00:36:02.970 --> 00:36:06.300
overflow and even super user
and server fall, we've formed

741
00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:08.400
some really nice communities of
smart people that know a

742
00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:10.500
lot of stuff. And they're
actually really interesting people to

743
00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:12.990
talk to. I mean, they're
there, I mean, brilliant. Some

744
00:36:12.990 --> 00:36:15.150
of them, and I think
any community is going to

745
00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:19.530
have that. So I think
maybe the answer is, and

746
00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:23.310
we haven't fully mapped the
topography of this world yet

747
00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:25.950
is that you actually have
some sort of back room.

748
00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:28.170
We have a metal site
on stack overflow, but even

749
00:36:28.170 --> 00:36:30.150
that has to be on
topic about, okay, you're talking

750
00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:32.730
about the website itself. You're
not two guys hanging out

751
00:36:32.770 --> 00:36:35.130
talking about each other, what
your, you know, where your

752
00:36:35.130 --> 00:36:37.260
kids are going to college
or whatever, but they're actually,

753
00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:38.940
maybe even needs to be
a third place that you

754
00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:42.780
have. You'd have say, let's
pick a server fault, which

755
00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:46.290
is about system administrators. She
would have server fault. You'd

756
00:36:46.290 --> 00:36:48.900
have a server fault, which
we kind of don't have.

757
00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:51.120
We have aggregated one at
the moment, but it would

758
00:36:51.130 --> 00:36:53.250
be meta about just that
site. And then actually even

759
00:36:53.250 --> 00:36:55.350
a third site, which would
be like off topic dot

760
00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:58.590
server fault.com. And you would
actually go there if you

761
00:36:58.590 --> 00:37:00.930
just wanted to talk about,
you know, whatever with these

762
00:37:00.930 --> 00:37:05.730
people that you've grown to
like, but I feel so

763
00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:10.350
many of these, these, these
forum engines optimized for discussion

764
00:37:10.350 --> 00:37:13.080
to the detriment of information
that I think it's okay

765
00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:15.150
for us to be a
little bit on the extreme

766
00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:17.820
side of like we're optimizing
for information. You know, we're,

767
00:37:18.090 --> 00:37:21.150
we're making it really hard
to have discussion because I

768
00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:25.410
think people follow the scent
of information because I think

769
00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:27.630
ultimately that's what people want.
All the discussion is great.

770
00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:29.610
There's nothing wrong with it.
In terms of adding value

771
00:37:29.610 --> 00:37:33.990
to the world, information is
what does it, quality breadcrumb

772
00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:36.930
trails have really good information
that, you know, there's no

773
00:37:36.930 --> 00:37:38.640
other place in the world
that can tell you exactly

774
00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:40.770
how to build a bow
in the way that these

775
00:37:40.770 --> 00:37:42.630
guys do. And there's a
whole community of people, you

776
00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:46.290
know, pumping out the really
fantastic, brilliant information on how

777
00:37:46.290 --> 00:37:49.530
they're doing this. And we're
unlocking that world. And the

778
00:37:49.530 --> 00:37:51.900
people that are attracted to
the sense of that information

779
00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:54.750
will ultimately build a stronger
community. Even though there's not

780
00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:57.930
technically hangout places and discussion
stuff, you eventually will have

781
00:37:57.930 --> 00:38:01.800
this, this supernova of information,
because that is the thing

782
00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:03.360
that comes to the top
in our system. And we

783
00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:05.700
think it does that really,
really well better than almost

784
00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:08.130
any other system. So for
those types of people, that

785
00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:11.700
attracted information, I think it's
irresistible now. There's for the

786
00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:13.650
people that are less into
the information and more into

787
00:38:13.650 --> 00:38:15.570
the hangout, there might be
other places you would want

788
00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:17.340
to go. There can be
more than one community on

789
00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:19.890
this topic. Ours is going
to be very information centric.

790
00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:21.540
So I think you have
sort of figured out like

791
00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:24.390
where you are on that
axis. Are you mostly about

792
00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:26.640
the information, a little bit
about the hanging out? Are

793
00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:29.310
you totally about the hanging
out? Normally I just they'll

794
00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:31.110
be both. Cause I like
hanging out with these guys,

795
00:38:31.470 --> 00:38:36.580
you know, I hear the
passion in Your voice, so

796
00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:38.440
I'll just give you some
like my opinion and stuff.

797
00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:40.480
So take, take it and
throw it away. But I

798
00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:42.310
think that if you want
to take over the internet

799
00:38:42.310 --> 00:38:45.970
in a larger sense, you've
got to you're you're you're,

800
00:38:45.970 --> 00:38:49.060
you're talking too much like
a programmer you're talking too

801
00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:51.400
much. I mean, yes. Information
is King, blah, blah, blah.

802
00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:54.850
School will blah, blah, blah
tech crunch. But there are

803
00:38:54.850 --> 00:38:57.910
some people who want the
community is just the collaboration

804
00:38:58.210 --> 00:39:01.480
and the questions are secondary.
And I think that if

805
00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:05.200
you want to get the,
the, the needle point ladies

806
00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:08.470
and the bow hunting mustache
people, you gotta realize that,

807
00:39:08.470 --> 00:39:10.180
that they, they, they may
want to just chat about

808
00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:12.850
stuff. And I think that
you're so close. You're like

809
00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:15.940
85% there. You could have
a chat about stuff, interface

810
00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:18.610
for stack overflow. Like let's
say that you had another

811
00:39:18.610 --> 00:39:22.570
John skeet, right? A bow
and arrow using mustache, John

812
00:39:22.570 --> 00:39:28.810
skeet, except he provides not
answers and brilliance, but just

813
00:39:28.810 --> 00:39:32.290
a sense of community. He's
just the chattiest, most friendly

814
00:39:32.350 --> 00:39:35.050
slap you on the back.
Here's a beer guy. He

815
00:39:35.050 --> 00:39:37.210
should get points in reputation
for that too, because he

816
00:39:37.210 --> 00:39:41.140
makes people feel good about
the community, but that person

817
00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:44.590
doesn't exist from a score
perspective and a stack overflow

818
00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:48.730
instance, but he would be
a great person to do

819
00:39:48.730 --> 00:39:52.800
needle point and bow and
arrows with, Well, we were

820
00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:55.530
in a meeting this week
with Neil bash as part

821
00:39:55.530 --> 00:39:57.450
of the New York city think
week thing that we did.

822
00:39:57.720 --> 00:39:59.880
And he actually made an
interesting observation, which I do

823
00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:03.420
agree with that the engine
may only work for communities

824
00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:06.720
where there's this core of
information where that that's the

825
00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:08.610
thing that we sort of
suck out as like, okay,

826
00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:11.370
we suck out all the
information. And then the people

827
00:40:11.370 --> 00:40:13.380
that were not really about
the information, they're just like,

828
00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:18.000
okay, you know, they, they
may need another place to

829
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.160
go. You may be, you
may be segregating the audiences

830
00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:23.490
at that point. I'm not
against adding things to the

831
00:40:23.490 --> 00:40:25.620
engine. I'm always open to
adding things that make sense.

832
00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:27.720
And part of the reason
we're doing this is as

833
00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:30.030
we, we grow these communities
and have these different communities,

834
00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:32.310
we want the engine to
evolve and become better. So

835
00:40:32.310 --> 00:40:35.070
I'm totally open to, to,
you know, changing it, to

836
00:40:35.070 --> 00:40:37.770
make it more adaptable. These
communities, as long as we're

837
00:40:37.770 --> 00:40:40.830
satisfying the core mission of
like filling the internet with

838
00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:43.350
really good information and some
discussion, you know, I mean,

839
00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:44.910
it's okay to have fun.
Like I had to write

840
00:40:44.910 --> 00:40:47.200
a whole blog post on
the stack overflow blog about

841
00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:51.120
like, look, it's okay to
occasionally have fun questions. We're

842
00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:54.000
not all business. We're not
like you can never ask

843
00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.430
anything fun or you will
be crushed by the boot

844
00:40:56.430 --> 00:40:59.070
heel of, you know, the
moderation system on stack overflow.

845
00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:01.140
That is not really the
case. But what you have

846
00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:04.980
to understand is that if
it's too much fun, it

847
00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:07.260
becomes no longer about the
information. It's like, Oh wow,

848
00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:10.440
this is fun. We were,
And it's fun. Like, you

849
00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:12.240
know, woo hoo. Look at
this funny video and Hey,

850
00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:16.380
keyboard, cat, play them off.
I'm just talking about community

851
00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:19.170
in the kind of huggy
kissy kind of way. And

852
00:41:19.170 --> 00:41:24.600
not in the talking about
answers. I think, I think

853
00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:26.340
you're, I think you're right.
And I think my point

854
00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:28.110
is that there's a certain
percentage of it. There's a

855
00:41:28.110 --> 00:41:32.430
certain balance ratio. That's good
for that. And when we

856
00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:37.610
calibrate little, you know, community
auditors, we're sliding the sliders

857
00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:39.830
over to certain positions and
it's heavy on the information

858
00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:43.550
side, but we do allow
some fun and that's intentional.

859
00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:45.590
And I think we do
allow some discussion because I

860
00:41:45.590 --> 00:41:48.380
mean, you have to have
some discussion, even understand the

861
00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:51.470
question that's being asked, right?
There's a certain amount that

862
00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:53.840
you just have to have.
He can get things done

863
00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:56.750
on the system. So I
am open to adjusting these

864
00:41:56.750 --> 00:42:00.590
sliders. What I'm not open
to though probably is like,

865
00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:03.080
when people say, Hey, you've
built a truck. That's great.

866
00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:04.430
It's the truck is great,
but I really want a

867
00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:06.260
sports car. You know? So
I think we have to,

868
00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:09.110
as we grow, we've gotta
figure out, okay, you really

869
00:42:09.110 --> 00:42:10.700
want a sports. If you
really want a sports car,

870
00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:12.440
you should buy a sports
car. You know? I mean,

871
00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:15.530
there's certain things we can
never fully adapt to, but

872
00:42:15.530 --> 00:42:17.450
you know, if you're in
a truck, you gotta carry

873
00:42:17.450 --> 00:42:18.920
six people and they just
get in the bed of

874
00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:21.860
the truck, right. It's not
super comfortable, but Hey, they're

875
00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:23.960
riding, they're getting to their
destination and the truck it's

876
00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:26.090
not optimal. But at the
point where it's like, Hey,

877
00:42:26.090 --> 00:42:27.620
this is, you know, we're
always riding in the back

878
00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:29.180
of your truck, let's close
it up and turn it

879
00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:32.030
into a bus. Then, you
know, you gotta be careful.

880
00:42:32.030 --> 00:42:34.400
I mean, it's just, it's
just a balancing act, but

881
00:42:34.670 --> 00:42:37.250
I am very, very open
to tweaking these little sliders

882
00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:40.490
a little bit in each
direction, depending on the, the

883
00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:43.520
tone of the community. As
long as it's is sacrifice

884
00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:46.340
our core mission of, you
know, you gotta love the

885
00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:48.050
information first. I mean, if
you, if you want to

886
00:42:48.050 --> 00:42:49.520
just hang out with people,
you should really be on

887
00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:52.310
Facebook. I think Facebook is
going to eventually dominate the

888
00:42:52.310 --> 00:42:54.260
internet in that way, for
those communities that you're talking

889
00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:57.950
about. I can't see any
future other than the dystopian,

890
00:42:57.950 --> 00:43:02.090
everybody's on Facebook solution for
those guys, because for them

891
00:43:02.090 --> 00:43:04.070
it's about the social graph.
It's about hanging out and

892
00:43:04.070 --> 00:43:07.640
stuff and you know, some
amount of that we do

893
00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:11.660
want, but it's people, it's
information first relationship second. And

894
00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:17.690
whereas Facebook is relationships. First
information. Third. So the question

895
00:43:17.690 --> 00:43:21.400
of where you, you balance
that. Well, Jeff, thank you

896
00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:22.840
so much for coming on
the show and talking about

897
00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:26.350
stack overflow. Well, at least
the short week we'll replace

898
00:43:26.350 --> 00:43:30.460
the stack overflow podcast. That's
right. We will definitely. Yeah.

899
00:43:30.730 --> 00:43:34.090
Thanks for having me on.
Thanks so much. Alright. This

900
00:43:34.090 --> 00:43:36.610
has been another episode of
Hansel minutes and we'll see

901
00:43:36.610 --> 00:43:37.510
you again next week.
