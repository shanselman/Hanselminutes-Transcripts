Scott talks with Zach Owens

7
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:50.690
about learning to speak another
one Language Scott Hanselman. This

8
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.120
is another episode of Hansel
minutes. And today on the

9
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.260
phone from where, where are
you? Zach? I'm in Beijing

10
00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.440
on the phone from Beijing.
Zach Owens is going to

11
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.440
talk to me about learning
languages, but not just learning

12
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.750
C sharp and VB and
Pascal and all that kind

13
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.860
of stuff, but learning foreign
languages. When I first heard

14
00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.320
about your story and hanging
out with you a couple

15
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.580
of times at Qdoba, I
was absolutely fascinated because I've

16
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.880
spent a lot of time
studying foreign languages, but ultimately

17
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.300
I've never lived overseas, which
effectively makes me a bit

18
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.420
of a poser when it
comes to, to speaking other

19
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.450
languages. Would you mind? I
don't, I don't buy that.

20
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.760
I don't buy that at
all. So what languages do

21
00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.380
you speak? I have some
conversational stuff and a couple

22
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.750
of different languages, but mostly
I'm finding if, if you

23
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.270
don't use them, you just
end up with some fun

24
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.370
phrases. You know what I
mean? Like I, I went

25
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.320
out with an Ethiopian girl
10 years ago for a

26
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.480
couple of years and I,
you know, I spoke Ethiopian

27
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.870
like, like maybe a five-year-old,
you know, as well on

28
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.880
my way. And then we
broke up and then, you

29
00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.470
know, now it's, you know,
50 phrases and I can

30
00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.530
read it, but that doesn't
make you fluent at all.

31
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.110
And now it's more of
a, I get to use

32
00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.060
it when I go to
a restaurant. So it makes

33
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.030
me feel sad. I speak
Chinese, like a five-year-old, if

34
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.890
that makes you feel any
better. And I've lived in

35
00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.730
China for about a year,
so Well, but I meet

36
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.490
lots of people who have
lived in, you know, country

37
00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.030
of choice for a year,
two years, three years, and

38
00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.710
you'll meet people. Who've lived
in the U S for

39
00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.650
20 years and haven't learned
English. So there are people

40
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.540
who, like, I met a
person who lived in Malaysia

41
00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.890
for five years and like,
didn't speak a word of

42
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.120
Malaysian. All they did was
hang out with the, with

43
00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.190
the locals. And that's not
your style. That's not my

44
00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.180
style. That's a recipe for
a, a sheltered life in

45
00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.780
another country. So you've, you've
done. You grew up where,

46
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.680
So I grew up in
the U S mostly in

47
00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.140
Michigan, but bounced around to
her to a lot of

48
00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:54.230
different places, Arizona, Texas, New Mexico.
I moved to Seattle to

49
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.170
work for Microsoft. I had
lived in Maui before that

50
00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.610
for a few years. So
kind of like adventure. I

51
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.710
lived in Spain for a
little while as well. So,

52
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.120
And if I remember correctly,
when you went to Spain,

53
00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.060
did you take language classes?
You actually found a tutor?

54
00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.630
Well, so when I went
to Spain, it was actually

55
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.620
my first year of college
and the excuse was to

56
00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.870
actually go study Spanish. So
I was there for six

57
00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.820
months studying Spanish and training
to race bicycles. And I

58
00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.300
ended up actually getting a
bachelor's degree in computer science

59
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.600
and in Spanish. So no
excuse not to speak Spanish.

60
00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.580
Yeah, indeed. And then you,
when I tell people about

61
00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.020
you, I say, well, yeah,
when he lived in Spain

62
00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.700
and he said, well, I'm
done with Spain for awhile

63
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.140
and I'll go somewhere else.
When did you have the

64
00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.450
opportunity to move to China?
And when did you decide

65
00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:43.710
that you would stick around
there more than just a

66
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:47.790
couple of months? Sure. So
Microsoft, one of the really

67
00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.160
cool things about it is
it's a global company. So

68
00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.480
there's this program that they
have for exchange between China

69
00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.740
and Microsoft headquarters. So there's
a three to six month

70
00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:03.000
rotation programs. And I convinced
my managers at the time

71
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.100
to let me come to
China for a six month

72
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.120
rotation. And pretty much the
first week I was here,

73
00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.220
I was thinking of ways
to find out how to

74
00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.430
stay because I knew I
loved it. So now I

75
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.090
actually work for the Microsoft
China subsidiary in a DPE

76
00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.260
and the developer and platform,
evangelism groups sort of focused

77
00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.280
on driving cloud computing in
China and no real plans

78
00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.000
to leave. I love it
here. So you knew you

79
00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.790
didn't speak Chinese when you
moved there and you knew

80
00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.650
you'd be working though. I
mean, are you, are you

81
00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.770
speaking, five-year-old child Chinese, isn't
in your job where you're

82
00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.360
speaking English most of the
time or a little, both.

83
00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.300
So at work. So especially
in the sales and marketing

84
00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.210
part of what's happening in
China, we've got engineering out

85
00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.540
here and we've got sales
and marketing. So engineering is

86
00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.630
much more of an English
speaking culture, even though most

87
00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.200
people are Chinese. Whereas sales
and marketing is pretty hardcore

88
00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.290
sort of Chinese culture, Chinese
language. I'm the only foreigner

89
00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:07.350
or the only, non-Chinese a
native speaker in our division

90
00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:12.300
out here. So most meetings
are in Chinese are all

91
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.400
of our all hands or
whatever it is, are in

92
00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.330
Chinese. So I have to
pick up from the conversations.

93
00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.130
And at this point I
pick up, you know, over

94
00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.310
50%, maybe 50 to 80%
of what's going on. But

95
00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.040
usually when I talk, it
will be in English. So

96
00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.800
I can have basic conversations
with people about sort of

97
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.840
life and like kind of
what's going on and over

98
00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.170
the weekend and the fundamentals.
But once it gets deeper

99
00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:37.080
than sort of that surface
level, I still can't express

100
00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.130
myself very articulately. And this
is after 12, 12 months,

101
00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:46.290
Probably like 14 months now.
And I've been doing one

102
00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:50.760
on one with a language
teacher anywhere between one to

103
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.220
five days a week. And
yeah, and that was where

104
00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.930
I wanted to kind of
take into that. How does

105
00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.710
that process work? Cause I
understand, you know, when you're,

106
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.430
you're learning a programming language,
you know, it's more common

107
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.950
to lock yourself in a
room with a problem and

108
00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:06.440
a language book and kind
of bang it out and

109
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.100
figure it out. Although that's
been traditionally more and more,

110
00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:13.160
you see people doing peer
programming to learn a programming

111
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.670
language or a grammar, but
we, we, we, we know

112
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:19.640
well that learning a language
and a culture you've got

113
00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.780
to go out and you've
got to use it. What

114
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.670
made you decide to sit
down with this tutor? Well,

115
00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:27.880
so I think the interesting,
I mean, especially in the

116
00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:30.850
context of your audience and
really this is where you

117
00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:33.970
and I started making some
connections on the potential to

118
00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:36.970
do a show on this
is I think there are

119
00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:40.810
some real similarities to learning
a programming language and learning

120
00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.830
a spoken language. So I've
loved programming. I'm a developer,

121
00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:48.250
I've learned a number of
different languages and there are

122
00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.830
some real similarities. I mean,
you point out the differences

123
00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:54.040
in that with the programming
language, you can lock yourself

124
00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:56.440
in a room and just
start banging out a problem

125
00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:00.340
and you figure out how
to get it done. Whereas

126
00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:02.620
the language you need sort
of more of a foundation.

127
00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:05.890
But I also believe that
to really learn a language

128
00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:10.270
it's much of the same
approach in terms of you

129
00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:13.150
get a foundation. I mean,
even generally, if I'm learning

130
00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:16.300
a new programming language, I
will spend some time reading

131
00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:19.810
some tutorials, writing some simple
apps to sort of figure

132
00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:23.110
out how the thing works
before going and jumping into

133
00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:25.900
a bigger project. I think
the language is the same

134
00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:30.820
thing. Like getting the fundamentals,
getting just a base understanding.

135
00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:32.890
And then the thing that's
really similar is that you

136
00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:35.620
have to just jump in
and start doing it to

137
00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:40.480
really learn it. So even
though I didn't speak any

138
00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.760
Chinese when I got here,
cause I didn't have a

139
00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:45.910
big planning stage of actually
coming out here. I mean,

140
00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:48.460
after I took three or
four classes and I knew

141
00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:51.470
how to say hello, and
a couple of basic phrases

142
00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:54.130
is I just started using
them all the time. And

143
00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:57.970
I think there are certain
language learners who are quite

144
00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:01.720
cautious about actually trying to
use it because it's, they're

145
00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.330
going to get it wrong.
Whereas I think if you

146
00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:08.290
apply the same approach is
really learning a new programming

147
00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:10.600
language and going for it.
You can really start to

148
00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:13.690
make progress. And so that's
where I think there's a

149
00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:16.270
big overlap in the two,
at least in that aspect.

150
00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:18.910
Wouldn't you say though, that
putting yourself out there is

151
00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:22.030
such a difficult thing to
do? I mean, certainly, you

152
00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:24.490
know, I, I I've, you
know, tried to teach myself

153
00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:28.720
Ruby, but I don't know,
idiomatic Ruby by any means

154
00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:34.030
to go out and ask
questions is a really difficult

155
00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:36.250
thing to go out and
write Ruby and talk to

156
00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:38.230
people who write Ruby and
write it wrong and blog

157
00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:41.980
about it wrong would be
really, really challenging. And that

158
00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:43.660
the same as the case,
if you're going to go

159
00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:47.020
off and start talking Chinese
to native Chinese, especially at

160
00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:50.290
work, I mean, how do
you get over that sounding

161
00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:55.530
like a total idiot? Well,
I guess the, the in

162
00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:58.770
both of those contexts that
I think is probably the

163
00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:03.570
potential for a saving grace
is modesty and humility. It's

164
00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:07.860
like, I know my Chinese,
isn't great. I know it's

165
00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:12.570
bad. I know I'm not
good at programming Ruby, and

166
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:14.730
I'm not going to try
and go sound like a

167
00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:19.350
Ruby expert, but I will
get up there and admit

168
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:22.140
the fact that I'm not
an expert in this technology

169
00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:25.110
and this, but here's my
potential thoughts. And you know,

170
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:27.780
let's have a conversation and
correct me when I'm wrong

171
00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:30.780
and I'm here to learn
from you. So I think

172
00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:36.300
a similar approach to trying
to speak a language goes

173
00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:39.650
a long way. I think
people in different countries that

174
00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:41.790
are different on this, but
in generally I think people

175
00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:44.310
love it when they see
that you're trying to speak

176
00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:48.210
their language, whether you're, you
know, the Microsoft guy coming

177
00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:52.800
into a web community that
people thought you were irrelevant,

178
00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:59.750
or whether you are A,
A westerner new to China

179
00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:03.110
and just trying to get
along as long as you're

180
00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:06.650
kind of humble and come
across in the right way.

181
00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:09.320
I think that's the, that's
the key thing. Someone said

182
00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:11.660
that the way that, you
know, you really don't know

183
00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:13.850
a language is if you
try to order food in

184
00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:17.390
that language and the waiter
immediately switches to English, it's

185
00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:18.950
just such a slap in
the face. You know what

186
00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:21.290
I mean? I always feel
like that if I order,

187
00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:23.270
if I ordered a Mexican
restaurant and I feel I'm

188
00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:25.700
feeling like particularly good about
my accent that day and

189
00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:27.620
I bust out something in
Spanish and the guy's like,

190
00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:37.370
really? So I hear you.
I, my perspective on that

191
00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:41.030
one from what I've experienced
in China in particular is

192
00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:44.810
depending where you're at, like
what part of the country

193
00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:49.730
and how comfortable the step,
the people who are you're

194
00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:53.510
talking to are with the,
with English versus with Chinese.

195
00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:57.620
So I find, so I
live in Beijing. So most

196
00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:00.710
foreigners in China would live
in Beijing or Shanghai. And

197
00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:03.530
there's, there's huge rivalries between
the cities. I love them.

198
00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:09.590
Both Shanghai is definitely much
more of a westernized society

199
00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:13.010
and culture based on their,
their history. Very understandably. Whereas

200
00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:16.100
Beijing is sort of the
heart of culture and government

201
00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:19.160
and things like that. So
I find in Beijing, it's

202
00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:24.440
much easier to learn Chinese,
learn Mandarin because you really

203
00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:26.780
have to use it much
more. So in your daily

204
00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:29.900
life, compared to in Shanghai,
a lot of the people

205
00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:34.370
that you'll interact with and
restaurants and especially certain kinds

206
00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:38.240
of restaurants will speak English
and we'll switch to English

207
00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:41.870
even once you start Chinese
sometimes. But I do agree

208
00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:44.270
with what you're saying now
though. Cause when I think

209
00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:47.000
back more, when I, I
go to Shanghai regularly and

210
00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:49.550
when I first started going
to Shanghai, I found it

211
00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:54.160
really difficult to speak Chinese
with anyone in Shanghai because

212
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.770
they would switch to English.
Whereas now that my Chinese

213
00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:58.660
has come along to the
point where I can have

214
00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:02.230
conversations with people the last
few times I've gone, they

215
00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:05.560
haven't switched. So thanks, Scott.
You just sort of made

216
00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:08.080
me feel a little bit
better about my progress. That's

217
00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:12.360
pretty awesome. Good for you.
I'm glad. Yeah. Thanks. Now

218
00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:15.570
you were saying though that
the, the sense of being

219
00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:18.570
comfortable and being humble and
being willing to jump in

220
00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:20.490
and you know, say, Hey,
I don't know anything about

221
00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:23.130
anything, but you know, here's
a good, here's a good

222
00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:27.030
try. That can be cute
with a fruit vendor or

223
00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:29.670
someone you see for 20
minutes. But for someone you

224
00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:32.820
have to work with 40
hours a day, they may

225
00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:36.090
not have the patience to
deal with you limping along

226
00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:39.060
in Chinese. Have you had
any trouble where it's, Hey,

227
00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:41.730
Hey, a Zack, it's not
cute anymore. You don't speak

228
00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:44.640
Chinese. So don't practice at
work, figure it out and

229
00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:46.680
come back to me when
you're better or are they

230
00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:50.550
infinitely patient patient. That's awesome.
I love the way you

231
00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:54.030
say that. So, Sorry. I
hope I'm not, I don't

232
00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:56.250
want to insult anybody, but
I just kind of putting

233
00:12:56.250 --> 00:13:00.940
myself like I'm imagining myself
in that situation. Well, I

234
00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:04.560
love it. So, and you're
right on. So I definitely

235
00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:09.270
don't try to speak Chinese
when I'm really trying to

236
00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:14.160
get a point across and
when it's an inappropriate time.

237
00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.190
So there's, so there's two
elements to that. One is

238
00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:22.410
at work. I speak Chinese
around the, some of the

239
00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:24.960
topics, just kind of like
social topics, like, you know,

240
00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.510
the hellos and kind of
what's going on and the

241
00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:30.360
social topics of a conversation
or when we go to

242
00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:34.140
lunch. So mix of Chinese
and English. And then I

243
00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:37.800
also have been starting to
mix in more Chinese, even

244
00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:43.470
with my English along around
certain phrases that are very

245
00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:46.230
sort of common to use.
So it's sort of blending

246
00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:50.730
a little bit, but I
definitely don't try to speak

247
00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:55.890
my really poor Chinese inappropriate
times when we're dealing with

248
00:13:55.890 --> 00:14:00.210
real issues. So, so that,
that has an impact though,

249
00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:04.980
because for me being in
China, that really limits the

250
00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:09.810
relationships that I can build
with customers and partners in

251
00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:14.370
particular, outside of Microsoft, who
aren't comfortable communicating in Chinese

252
00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:18.900
or in English. So it
really is a challenge as

253
00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:21.630
someone in a culture where
you don't speak the language

254
00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:24.900
well, to be able to
connect and know and build

255
00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:29.370
relationships. And especially in China
where relationships are ultra important,

256
00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:32.310
lots of other places they
are too, but it is

257
00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:35.520
very important in China. So
it limits what I can

258
00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:38.940
do here, which is really
the big reason for me

259
00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:41.730
that I'm trying to learn
Chinese so hard is that

260
00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:45.120
I believe in the importance
of China and sort of

261
00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:48.600
the future of the world.
And I love China and

262
00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:51.120
I want to really be
able to know it and

263
00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:54.440
to be successful here. So
learning the language I think

264
00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:57.890
is really important. So yeah,
I think you nailed it

265
00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:01.640
though. You can't, people won't
be patient with me and

266
00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:05.270
my cute Chinese, if we're
in a heated discussion about

267
00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:11.440
anything really. So yeah, There's
a, there's a, there's an

268
00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:18.910
American, a writer named David
Sedaris who is great. He's

269
00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:22.330
a great kind of commentator
and comedian and he lives

270
00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:25.240
in France. Now. I think
he grew up in, I

271
00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:29.820
want to say South Carolina or
something like that. And he

272
00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:31.450
said that he was really,
I seem to remember him

273
00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:33.430
saying he was very frustrated
when he moved to France

274
00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:37.570
and how all the babies
spoke French so wonderfully. And

275
00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:39.460
he was just like, they're
so smart. They speak French.

276
00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:42.640
You know, I wish I
could kind of, you know,

277
00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:44.770
I thought he thought that
the language, the learning of

278
00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:48.280
French would, would come on
its own the way that

279
00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:52.300
it comes to babies, except
people don't talk to foreigners

280
00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:55.240
the way that they talk
to babies. Here's the, here's

281
00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:57.790
the quote he says, he
says they don't hypnotize you

282
00:15:57.790 --> 00:16:00.220
with bright objects and repeat
the same words over and

283
00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:03.550
over handing out little treats
when you finally say potty,

284
00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:09.820
right? So he said, yeah,
he would basically get jealous

285
00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:12.160
when he saw a baby
in a bakery because he's

286
00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:14.170
like that kid has it
really easy. You know, I

287
00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:16.090
want to lie in a
French crib and start from

288
00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:19.330
scratch and learn the language
from the ground up. So

289
00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:22.090
instead he ends up being
this kind of spooky man-child

290
00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:25.990
that really is like, hi,
I am sprints speaking, learn.

291
00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:29.260
I want to have coffee.
You. And it was so

292
00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.930
far, I find the same
thing myself, when I'm trying

293
00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:35.620
to make myself understood. I'm
feeling like if only they

294
00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:38.410
knew me, they would know
I'm not an idiot. You

295
00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:42.130
know? Like you feel like
the barrier to the language

296
00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:45.760
is preventing you from putting
your best self forward. And

297
00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:49.960
it's caused me to be
really, what's the word really

298
00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:52.840
empathetic when I hear speak
with people trying to speak

299
00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:54.490
English to me and they
say, Oh, I'm so sorry

300
00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:55.960
for my poor English. And
the first thing out of

301
00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:57.610
my mouth is I'm sorry,
I don't speak your language.

302
00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:01.450
Gosh, you're trying to be
doing so well. Yeah. So

303
00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:03.640
I think you hit on
a few interesting points there,

304
00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:11.170
one that language learning when
you're under, I think six

305
00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:13.270
Pat, and then once you're
over six or something in

306
00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:16.360
that sort of age range,
it's different. Like it goes

307
00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:18.700
into a different place in
your brain. It's engraved in

308
00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:22.960
a different sort of way.
So there's definitely just a

309
00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:25.570
difference in learning when you're
that young versus older, apart

310
00:17:25.570 --> 00:17:29.410
from just the flashy shiny
objects and repeating the words

311
00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:33.510
in your face. So, and
that, that reminds me of

312
00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:37.690
another related topic in that.
So Rosetta stone being sort

313
00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:43.780
of the leading software for
language learning. So I believe

314
00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:47.770
their methods are based largely
on an approach that is

315
00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:51.990
similar to language as a
child and that sort of

316
00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:55.680
repeating of things. And it's
all in the native language

317
00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:59.250
or in the, in the
foreign language. And it's, it's

318
00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:01.830
based on the similar approach
to learning from a child.

319
00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:06.030
Whereas I used some software
in, when I first got

320
00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:09.660
out here called Fluenz like
F L U E N

321
00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:13.620
Z, and really cool innovative
company that really puts a

322
00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:17.010
lot of effort into just
the user experience of their

323
00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:21.510
software and just really, really
great, really well done software.

324
00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:24.060
And they're the kind of
company that you want to

325
00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:27.330
support with just everything they're
doing. So, and their approach

326
00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:30.570
is different and doesn't take
that same style to language

327
00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:34.740
learning. And I found that
that adult language learners, you

328
00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:38.340
need a different approach. So
I think that's sort of

329
00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:41.640
an interesting side topic. And
then another thing you, you

330
00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:45.270
pointed out was this sort
of notion of how you

331
00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:48.930
come across to people you're
talking to in the foreign

332
00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:53.340
language. And there's this guy
who's sort of famous in

333
00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:56.670
China and for China Watchers,
a guy named Kaiser Guam.

334
00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:01.080
And so I met Kaiser
at South by Southwest. He

335
00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:03.360
did like a Google in
China talk, right? When sort

336
00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:05.430
of a bunch of stuff
was going down between them

337
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:08.330
a few years ago. Yeah.
And I know him in

338
00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:12.500
a bit. And so he
does a whole podcast series,

339
00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:15.560
really interesting called Sinica. And
he spent a writer for

340
00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:18.740
magazines and articles and stuff
like that. So there's this

341
00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:21.950
one article he wrote that
talks about this very same

342
00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:25.310
topic, how you are a
different person in your non

343
00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:28.580
native language. And much of
the time it is, you're

344
00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:32.210
a much, you're a simpleton.
You don't come across as

345
00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:35.840
eloquent. Your personality is different
and he relates it. Even

346
00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:39.350
if I can get this
right. Even relates it to

347
00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:44.720
some people, they learn Chinese
in Beijing cabs in Beijing

348
00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:47.120
cab drivers are all like
real local sort of Beijing

349
00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:49.190
owners and like Gummer and
really sort of chew on

350
00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:51.140
their arms and like just
a whole different kind of

351
00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:53.390
way you talk and sort
of like slang and some

352
00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:56.150
foul sort of speech. And
so you'd have these sort

353
00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:58.370
of really elegant English speakers,
but then when they start

354
00:19:58.370 --> 00:20:01.550
speaking Chinese, they sound like,
you know, just a hardcore

355
00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:04.970
Beijing cabby. And then another
one that I think is

356
00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:08.240
even more funny is some
of the foreigners here who

357
00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:11.540
maybe they have like a
Chinese girlfriend or a wife

358
00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:14.870
or whatever that is. And
they learn Chinese largely through

359
00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:16.970
that. So when, you know,
they may be a super

360
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.520
sort of macho masculine guy,
but then when they start

361
00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:22.160
speaking Chinese, all of a
sudden they're like using all

362
00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:25.340
of these terms that are
much more feminine and sort

363
00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:28.100
of ended up really coming
off as a different personality.

364
00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:32.750
So it's definitely something to
be empathetic when you're listening

365
00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:37.010
to non native speakers. That
really the way they're coming

366
00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:39.260
to might not be the
core of who they really

367
00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:42.320
are. So that's good. Yeah.
If you, if you, for

368
00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:45.860
example, learn, I met some
kids in Southeast Asia that

369
00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:49.540
had learned most of their
English watching like Terminator And

370
00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:52.150
you know, and this just
like, wow, we don't really

371
00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:54.070
talk like that, but they
don't know. They're just trying

372
00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:55.540
it. So then you might
get a sense that this

373
00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:58.710
is a really intense kind
of a, you know, it's

374
00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:03.490
like meeting a, a stereotypical
mobster type from the forties

375
00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:05.800
or something in New York. And
you realize that this is

376
00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:08.200
just how the kid happened
to learn the language. And

377
00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:11.200
you know, so you don't
even know who your, who

378
00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:13.920
your tutor is, right? I
mean, who, what, what, what

379
00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:16.810
Chinese accent or Chinese style
or, and not just the

380
00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:20.800
accent, but the idiomatic speech
and the tempo and the

381
00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:23.380
tambour of how you speak,
what is that saying about

382
00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:26.190
you? Exactly. It's true. That's
why you have to have

383
00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:28.260
a lot of friends. So
for me, I've got a

384
00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:30.720
lot of Western friends and
a lot of friends here

385
00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:33.960
who are, are Chinese and
speak English, but definitely you

386
00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:36.030
gotta mix it up. If
you have the opportunity to

387
00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:39.570
live in a culture where
you are there, it's not

388
00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:42.060
just be friends with the
same people. Don't just learn

389
00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:46.920
Chinese from your teacher. So
sort of use my study

390
00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:49.020
as the foundation and then
use it as much as

391
00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:51.930
possible with different people. And
you gotta mix it up.

392
00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:55.110
That reminds me this guy,
the Terminator movie, I met

393
00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:57.720
him just a few nights
ago. So there's a city

394
00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:01.290
in China called Yon Thai
that's by the ocean. So

395
00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:04.200
Yon tie, Dave is his
name. So he's this Chinese

396
00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:07.980
dude who studied English, but
he learned, he really liked

397
00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:10.740
the Cockney accent and in
particular, like sort of British

398
00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:15.510
gangster films. So this guy
is hilarious. He sounds, and

399
00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:17.850
it's, his accent is perfect.
I was hanging out with

400
00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:19.710
him the other night with
a bunch of other English

401
00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:23.620
guys and one dude who
was actually Cockney and, and

402
00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:26.880
they just sounded the exact
same and Cockney Dave, he

403
00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:31.440
just like comes off like
a pure English gangster. It's

404
00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:34.800
awesome. So yeah, if you
tune it right, you can

405
00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:36.960
really sort of shape the
person that you want to

406
00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:40.590
be. If you really sort
of put some conscious effort

407
00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:44.340
into it, How much time
do you spend thinking about

408
00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:48.720
language you're 14 months into
it? You're you're probably, would

409
00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:53.160
you say you're conversationally fluent
in Chinese? What level would

410
00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:55.710
you put you on a,
you know, you're comfortable, right?

411
00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:58.590
You're certainly you could go
to Chinatown in San Francisco

412
00:22:58.590 --> 00:23:02.040
and impress a lot of
people. I'm sure. I mean,

413
00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:05.340
I guess it's to the
point I I've gone through

414
00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:07.830
phases where I've, you know,
studied five days a week

415
00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:10.530
and done my homework and
really been hardcore and felt

416
00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:13.260
like I was progressing. And
then there've been phases where

417
00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:15.630
other priorities, you know, for
a month or two at

418
00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:18.240
a time took hold and
wasn't studying a lot and

419
00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:21.240
things like that. So, so
it goes in sort of

420
00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:23.760
ebbs and flows like that.
But at this point, I

421
00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:27.540
would say I'm comfortable to
get around and to have,

422
00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:30.900
you know, general kind of
basic conversations. Now, when I

423
00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:34.110
meet customers and partners, if
I'm doing presentations and things

424
00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:35.730
like that, I've got to
do them in English, but

425
00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:38.070
I can do my intro
in Chinese. And when we

426
00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:40.200
have lunch, I can talk
to them about sports and

427
00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:43.440
friends and family and where
I'm from and things like

428
00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:46.790
that. And in Chinese, you
know, it's getting better every

429
00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:49.640
day, every day, Ella, you,
how you'd say in Chinese.

430
00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:54.190
Yeah. Well, one thing I'd
say that's What, sorry, I

431
00:23:54.190 --> 00:23:55.340
was going to say, so
you touch on kind of

432
00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:57.580
what direction I was going,
which is you, you, you

433
00:23:57.580 --> 00:23:59.860
say that there were days
or months or periods of

434
00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:02.050
time where you're like, okay,
I'm studying, I'm hardcore, I'm

435
00:24:02.050 --> 00:24:03.820
moving. It's like, you know,
it's like when you're hitting

436
00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:05.350
the gym all the time
and then, and then there's

437
00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:10.000
a plateau, right? How much
do you think about getting,

438
00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:14.080
getting fluent? Like how much
has fluency or at least

439
00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:16.690
as a reasonable amount of
fluency as a, as an

440
00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:20.680
adult westerner can get part
of the goal. So when,

441
00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:23.500
when your China experience ends,
whether it's next year or

442
00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:26.110
when you're 50, you'll come
out and you'll go, yeah,

443
00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:28.810
man, and I'm fluent and
that's awesome. Or will it

444
00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:31.180
be less about the language
and more about the experience?

445
00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:39.130
I'd say the language is
a facilitator to having the

446
00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:44.170
right experience for me. So
actual speaking of Chinese, it's

447
00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:47.380
a, it's kind of fun,
but I do it because

448
00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:51.280
I want to be able
to experience China in a

449
00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:53.080
deep way. And I want
to be able to be

450
00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:56.290
successful here and be able
to sort of know what's

451
00:24:56.290 --> 00:24:59.200
really going on. So I'd
say it's more about the

452
00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:02.440
experience, but that language is
just so core to having

453
00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:04.930
the right experience. At least
for me, that's why I

454
00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:07.990
enjoy it. It's also with
Spanish. Like I love Spain.

455
00:25:08.050 --> 00:25:11.020
I want to live in
Spain again. I want to

456
00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:13.810
keep my Spanish going. And
one thing right now, and

457
00:25:13.810 --> 00:25:15.850
this relates back to the
learning as a kid or

458
00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:18.430
as an adult, it's kind
of funny because I think

459
00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:21.460
as an adult, all of
your extra, your additional languages

460
00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:23.710
kind of go to this
one place in your brain.

461
00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:27.160
And right now, when I
think of Chinese and Spanish,

462
00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:30.520
they both look the same
in my brain. And when

463
00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:32.890
I try, when I speak
Spanish, now, sometimes I start

464
00:25:32.890 --> 00:25:37.210
mixing in Chinese and to
Spanish people that I'm talking

465
00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:39.880
to, who don't know Chinese,
they just like their head

466
00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:41.950
tilts and turns. And I
don't even realize that I

467
00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:44.980
switched between the two languages.
So, so it's kind of,

468
00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:48.070
yeah, It's funny that you
say that because I've got

469
00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:52.330
a bunch of, of, of
Ethiopian Amharic in my brain

470
00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:55.020
from 10 years ago and
I've gotten, you know, I've

471
00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:56.830
got the books and every
couple of months, I'll just

472
00:25:56.830 --> 00:25:58.390
kind of like go through
the first five or six

473
00:25:58.390 --> 00:26:00.550
chapters and make sure that
I've not completely lost it,

474
00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:04.330
but I'm also trying to
learn my wife's language. None

475
00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:07.150
of the, our mother, her
mother or my mother-in-law stays

476
00:26:07.150 --> 00:26:09.730
with us. So I've got
my sons, my wife, my,

477
00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:12.550
my sister in law, her
kids, everyone's all speaking the

478
00:26:12.550 --> 00:26:17.560
same language and I'm having
trouble keeping the end to

479
00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:21.820
belly. It's called the belly.
That's a symbolic language. I'm

480
00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:25.300
having trouble keeping their language
and Emeric straight. And I

481
00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:28.030
I'll look at something and
the Amharic word will come

482
00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:30.400
right to mind. And then
I'll end up putting together

483
00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:35.800
a complete Zulu or in
Dibeli sentence with an Ethiopian

484
00:26:36.010 --> 00:26:38.590
direct object in the middle
of it somewhere. And it

485
00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:41.950
makes total sense to me
because somehow there's an African

486
00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:44.640
language center that is put
all of that stuff in

487
00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:47.370
one place. It's almost like
Americans can only have one

488
00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:52.040
other language we're not allowed
three. So, so maybe that

489
00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:55.460
is true. So do you
find that happens when you're

490
00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:57.980
writing code? Like, and does
it have to do if

491
00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:03.500
they're like syntax syntactically based
on like, say C, C,

492
00:27:03.530 --> 00:27:06.860
C plus, plus like, so
if you're writing C-sharp and

493
00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:09.950
Java script or PHP, they
can all just sort of

494
00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:12.530
mix. And, but then if
you get into something that's

495
00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:16.010
a whole sort of different
syntactical base, then it, it

496
00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:19.370
stays separate. Or do you
find you can separate your

497
00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:23.240
programming languages? So that's a
good question because you're saying

498
00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:26.330
that Chinese and Spanish are
mixing in your head. And

499
00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:29.120
from my perspective, they have
no business mixing. Like there's

500
00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:33.620
not, they're not even close.
I'm mixing two to two

501
00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:37.160
African languages that both have
what are called glottals glottal

502
00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:42.470
stops. They have specific sounds.
That sounds like that sounds

503
00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:46.790
similar. And they kind of
in the same general neighborhood,

504
00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:49.310
there's still 2000 miles behind,
but there's still, you know,

505
00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:54.080
it I'm, hurricane is more
Afro Semitic and in the

506
00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:56.180
belly is more bond too.
But the point is there,

507
00:27:56.270 --> 00:27:59.630
at least they have some
shared sounds, but I'm like,

508
00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:01.610
wow, how are you? So
I guess what I'm saying

509
00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:03.800
is I'm I organize them
in my brain by sound

510
00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:08.570
and by how they feel
in my mouth. But you're

511
00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:11.180
saying that you're mixing two
languages that don't look or

512
00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:15.950
feel anything alike. So well,
Yeah, they definitely aren't based

513
00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:21.440
on the same, like roots
for me, they just, they

514
00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:25.220
feel the same. They're they,
I feel like they both

515
00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:28.670
have, cause in Chinese when
you write it in opinion

516
00:28:28.670 --> 00:28:31.490
and like the Romanized version
of it instead of Chinese

517
00:28:31.490 --> 00:28:36.710
characters, no, they're, they're usually
short words. They have a

518
00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:39.890
lot of vowels. I don't
know. I don't, I've never

519
00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:42.260
tried to figure out exactly
why, but I swear, like

520
00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:44.600
in the way I picture
it in my mind, they

521
00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:47.900
look the exact same and
they can interchange without any

522
00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:51.740
problems. So Do you have,
do you have an example,

523
00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:54.500
give us, give us a
sentence that you might say

524
00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:57.800
where you accidentally order a
burrito in Spanish, or what

525
00:28:57.800 --> 00:28:59.810
is it an Indian, Chinese
rather? Is there a sentence

526
00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:02.390
that you can think of
that would be the kind

527
00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:04.010
of thing that you would
mix up when you mix

528
00:29:04.010 --> 00:29:08.770
the two, You know, being
put on the spot? I

529
00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:11.360
think I could, but if
I actually started to try

530
00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:14.060
and speak Spanish right now,
I guarantee the Chinese would

531
00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:18.140
just start mixing in. So
yeah, it just happens. It's

532
00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:23.780
really, That's funny. Yeah. So
you said your, your open-ended

533
00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:26.300
in China right now. You
you'll stay there until the

534
00:29:26.390 --> 00:29:32.060
next thing comes up. That's
my plan. If my mom

535
00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:34.880
hears this, she's not gonna
like hearing that, but you

536
00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:38.840
know, I like it. I
am pretty embedded now. Like

537
00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:42.280
got the friend group happening
here, feel much more like

538
00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:46.510
it's home, I've got my
motorcycles and just the life

539
00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:50.770
is just feeling really comfortable.
So, I mean, we'll see

540
00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:52.570
what, where life takes me.
I'm not one to make

541
00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:56.080
huge long range plans, but
I like it. There's a

542
00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:58.810
lot happening here. A lot
of opportunity. It's a culture

543
00:29:58.810 --> 00:30:03.280
where, because sort of just
economically and society leaders, this

544
00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:07.630
huge sort of progress it's
happening, it's like palpable. Like

545
00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:09.610
you can just feel it
in the culture. I mean,

546
00:30:09.610 --> 00:30:12.340
there's definitely elements of culture
where there's a lot of,

547
00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:15.310
sort of concern about social
welfare and about a lot

548
00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:18.610
of sort of issues. But
in general, it's a place

549
00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:20.980
where things are really on
the rise and you can

550
00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:23.770
feel it in the society.
So it's really just a

551
00:30:24.010 --> 00:30:27.370
nice place to be in
that way. So yeah, no

552
00:30:27.370 --> 00:30:29.560
plans to leave school. The
question is when are you

553
00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:32.250
going to come out here
and visit? I was there.

554
00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:34.260
I was there like a,
what was it? Eight months

555
00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:37.920
ago with Dame sr. Yeah,
I know doing the webcams.

556
00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:42.600
So I don't, I wasn't
here when you were, You

557
00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:43.860
were, I think you were
on a business trip or

558
00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:46.830
something. Yeah, it may have
been, or maybe You've crossed

559
00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:49.830
over Hawaii somewhere. I'm not
sure Could have, could have

560
00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:52.530
been for sure. I will
Back. I will come back

561
00:30:52.530 --> 00:30:54.420
and then, then you will
teach me more Chinese because

562
00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:57.240
the only Chinese, I know
who to two taught me

563
00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:01.650
this stupid little phrase. There's
a little kid and my

564
00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:03.990
accent is her. This is
the one Chinese phrase. I

565
00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:10.420
know Nisha Kwan Show me,
you selected you, you liked

566
00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:13.320
like nice. You've won It.
Like, do you like my

567
00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:16.590
nose? Yeah, that's what I
thought it was pizza. So

568
00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:20.070
it's, it's pretty common thing
for a Chinese to point

569
00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:24.000
out about Oh, Westerners in
particular. So yeah, like Niecy

570
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.370
quad means like, do you
like, like ni is a

571
00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:29.400
U and then see Kwan
like then will the beads

572
00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:33.120
like, well would be me.
So will the beads, This

573
00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:36.750
one will the beads ma
Yes. That's pretty good. One.

574
00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:38.490
You should, you need to
keep that The one in

575
00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:40.110
the memory bank, because you
never know when you might

576
00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:41.820
want to ask a random
Chinese person, if they like

577
00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:47.190
your nose. Well, that is
a conversation starter, like nobody's

578
00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:49.870
business. You ever want to
just break the ice with

579
00:31:50.970 --> 00:31:53.850
someone in China, you have
that phrase in your pocket

580
00:31:53.850 --> 00:31:57.570
and there is there's no
stop. Oh, so I got

581
00:31:57.570 --> 00:31:59.940
that going for me. That's
fantastic. Well, so nice to

582
00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:01.770
talk to you again, Zach
and I look forward to

583
00:32:01.770 --> 00:32:03.540
seeing you again. I'm not
sure what country we'll be

584
00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:06.570
in, but I'm sure. Go
ahead and send me, send

585
00:32:06.570 --> 00:32:09.030
me the link to these
different learning programs and language

586
00:32:09.030 --> 00:32:10.740
programs that worked for you.
I'm sure that the folks

587
00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:13.110
that are listening would love
to learn more about this

588
00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:16.490
was at fluent as well
as fluent, as well as

589
00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:20.220
Rosetta stone. Yeah. And Sinica,
I'll send a link to

590
00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:22.470
that because people are just
interested in China. They've got

591
00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:24.960
a great podcast series about
sort of current events in

592
00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:27.750
China, from a bunch of
sort of old hand China

593
00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:31.470
Watchers that really recommended. Can
you, can you take us

594
00:32:31.470 --> 00:32:33.690
out in Chinese on our
show today? Can you say

595
00:32:33.690 --> 00:32:38.010
anything even a children's nursery
rhyme that we can just

596
00:32:38.010 --> 00:32:44.470
say is the minutes Introduction
an extra? Oh, well, I

597
00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:47.890
don't know. How about your,
how about what's that? I

598
00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:49.960
was going to say how
much you're into your standard

599
00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:54.340
business introduction when you're giving
a presentation. Oh, wow. Well

600
00:32:54.370 --> 00:32:57.970
the real typical one, there
would be like, you know,

601
00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:07.780
Walsher, Owen's a Woodside <inaudible>
so that means just like,

602
00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:10.420
Hey, I'm Zach I'm Owen.
So my, my last name

603
00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:13.360
is Owens, so, Oh. And
sir is my Chinese name,

604
00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:16.300
which has really cool meanings.
And that pretty much means

605
00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:19.570
then been in China for
a year. My Chinese isn't

606
00:33:19.570 --> 00:33:23.500
that good? So I need
to speak English. Cool. That's

607
00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:25.780
awesome. That's the easy one.
I've got some more I

608
00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:28.090
can add if I really
need to, but that one,

609
00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:31.960
that one's pretty simple and
flows, so Very nice. Well,

610
00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:35.620
thanks so much. This has
been another episode of Hansel

611
00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:37.480
minutes. See you again next
week.
