In this episode, Scott talks

14
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:23.690
with Carl about HDT. Hi,
this is Carl Franklin. You're listening

15
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.680
to Hansel minutes. I'm here
with Scott again this week.

16
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.940
A great show last week
with Chris ELLs. I thought

17
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.950
Scott. Yeah, I thought it
went really well. It was

18
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.170
an interesting diversion. We might
try that a little bit

19
00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.900
more. That'd be great when
famous people moved next door

20
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.590
to me. Absolutely. It was
a, it was fun. So

21
00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.150
we're talking this week about
HDTV and HTMI and all

22
00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.480
those diversion, right? A little
bit, not, not a, not

23
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.400
a technical thing. I mean,
well, it's technical, but it's

24
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.240
not developers. Right, right. Unless
you're writing video codecs yourself,

25
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.210
but you know, I posted
my blog recently that I've

26
00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.510
been redoing the kitchen and
I did some tile and

27
00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.420
we've been laying some new
floors and some new counters

28
00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.120
and just various and sundry
things around the house. And

29
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.050
we decided to paint a
wall. So yesterday I took

30
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.900
down the shrine to the
screen. We've all got one

31
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.540
of those right in the
corner there. Right? Big stack

32
00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.480
of components that have been
around forever. And in the

33
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.370
process, I said, Hey, this
is really kind of a

34
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.740
mess. I wanted to just
not just redo my room

35
00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.540
and do some painting. But
I also wanted to redo

36
00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.540
the way that we, we
kind of watched TV. We've

37
00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.400
redone that a little bit
by having a, do you

38
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.160
know, a DVR? Do you
watch much TV girl? You

39
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.330
know, I do. And I
got my plasma 42 inch

40
00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:41.060
in my high Def stuff
last year. Cool. And yeah,

41
00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.310
it took me a while
to sort of figure out

42
00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.350
how to use the thing,
you know, in terms of

43
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.260
what the TV watching behavior.
But now at the beginning

44
00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.570
of the week, I go
through the, you know, the

45
00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.610
list of shows that are
on the channels that I

46
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.980
like. And I pick off
the record, the ones I

47
00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.540
want to watch all the
way through the week. And

48
00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.040
then, you know, when I
get some free time, I

49
00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.130
sit down and watch him.
And this was all in

50
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.430
high Def. Oh yeah. I'm
only watching high-def shows now.

51
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.690
And where do you get
that content come from? Where

52
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.060
does it come from? It's
cable, it's the local digital

53
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.620
cable service. And then they
give you a digital DVR

54
00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.930
of some kind. They did.
It's a Motorola box. It's

55
00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.900
someone that a lot of
People use, right? This would

56
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.430
be the Motorola 64 12.
I think, I think the

57
00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.480
details on that are at
a shrink stir slash I

58
00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.110
T J we've got Comcast
out here in Portland, Oregon

59
00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.680
where I'm at. And we
have COVID Comcast, Motorola, HD

60
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.910
DVR as well. This is
a really crappy, crappy digital

61
00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.690
video recorder. It's not very
good, but I do. I

62
00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.050
get ahead of myself. So
we're redoing this, this living

63
00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:47.970
room. We want to have
high Def, we've got high-def

64
00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.610
now, but we want to
change the change, the experience,

65
00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.260
because right now it's not
just turn the TV on

66
00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.000
and turn up back in
the day it used to

67
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.420
be right, right now, it's,
I've got macros and fancy

68
00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.330
remote controls and I've got,
I've got separate components, right?

69
00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.180
So I have a, a,
an amplifier and all that

70
00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.480
kind of stuff. It's way
too complicated. It is way

71
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.490
too complicated. It needs to
be much easier. So one

72
00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:12.900
of the things that often
people get confused by like

73
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.810
first, what is HD? Because
a lot of people have

74
00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.180
been running DVD players for
awhile. And for a few

75
00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.690
years ago, everyone was trying
to say, Oh, I have

76
00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.310
HD. When they really had
four 80 P or progressive

77
00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.790
coming out of their DVD
player, kind of the first

78
00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.830
thing that most people got
to see as far as

79
00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.520
an improvement in television quality
was what are called anamorphic

80
00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.460
DVDs. I had this on
an old Sony TV. This

81
00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.490
is when you've got a
16 by nine ratio, right?

82
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.250
A widescreen DVD that you're
going to be watching on

83
00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:49.350
a four by three, you
know, mostly square TV. This

84
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.170
is where they fill the
vertical space. They use all

85
00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:55.380
those lines, all 480 lines
that the DVD player can

86
00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.220
produce. They fill that up
rather than putting black bars

87
00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:04.260
there. And then you're getting
more lines, more detail than

88
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.680
your TV. Squishes it back
to a normal ratio. You

89
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.410
can get details on anamorphic
DVDs. It shrinks your slash

90
00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.750
ITB or at a widescreen
old Rama at shrinks or

91
00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:19.560
slash ITC. So four 80
P is what DVD players

92
00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.040
put out. And most of
the now are anamorphic. And

93
00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.570
we don't even notice it.
We don't think about that.

94
00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:28.800
Especially if you have a
widescreen TV, the system automatically

95
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.310
knows that 40 P widescreen
can be stretched to fill

96
00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.550
most of a 16 by
nine screen. Now, what is

97
00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:39.900
your, what is your, your
primary video connection done with

98
00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:44.460
Carla's component or DVI or
HTMI It's HTMI although I

99
00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:49.770
connect the computer with component
and I use HTMI from

100
00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.440
the cable Box. Okay. So
you've got HDI going from

101
00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.070
a Comcast Motorola directly into
your TV. Do you run

102
00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.480
the audio through that? Well,
no. The audio is the

103
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:04.060
optical audio, which goes right
to my receiver. So with

104
00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:08.080
HTMI, which is a, a
kind of connector, a video

105
00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.890
connector, it includes audio on
it. If you want, this

106
00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:17.650
was the, the studio's idea
to protect, to include protection

107
00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:21.040
kind of in the hardware.
Cause HTML HTMI supports a

108
00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:25.750
thing called a aided HD
HDCP I keep forgetting the

109
00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:29.380
acronym. There's so many acronyms
here, but it's yeah, it

110
00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:33.010
is a HTMI can have
protected content running on it

111
00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:36.650
so that a TV could
say, I support HTMI as

112
00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:39.790
an unprotected signal, but I
don't support this protection schemes.

113
00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.590
I'm not going to let
you watch it. So there's

114
00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:44.920
a lot of complaints right
now that some Vista machines

115
00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.230
and some monitors won't be
compatible out of the box.

116
00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.270
And they're going to say,
well, your monitor doesn't support

117
00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.880
the protection scheme. We're not
going to let you watch

118
00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:54.040
this. So what'll happen is
you'll get like a high

119
00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.890
definition DVD. You'll plug it
in your monitor. Won't support.

120
00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:00.070
Hi-def you'll get low Def
you may get it without

121
00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:03.490
asking, or you may get
a warning. So there's component

122
00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:07.270
video, which are basically those
old RCA cables, except there's

123
00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:09.310
one for red, you know,
art, you know, there's did

124
00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:13.060
ones for different colors, right?
And then they that'll run

125
00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:16.600
anything up to and including,
you know, 10 80, very,

126
00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.000
very high results. What I've
noticed. I don't know if

127
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.290
you've noticed it, but the
signal tends to get, it

128
00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:26.530
tends to be a little
more susceptible to interference when

129
00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:30.910
you're using component video. That
looks pretty good. But sometimes

130
00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:36.280
you can get some weird
psychotic effects, Right? That's because

131
00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:38.920
it's ultimately an analog signal
at that point. That's running

132
00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:42.640
over those wires right now,
DVI and HTMI are a

133
00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:46.000
lot less successful susceptible to
that because it's running a

134
00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:49.090
digital now DVI we're familiar
with, because we'll see that

135
00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:53.080
a lot on LCDs and
flat screen monitors. Mac is

136
00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.480
really big on that. Although
sometimes the pins don't line

137
00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:58.150
up. Well, you know, what's
weird is that we bought

138
00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:01.630
our, our plasma TV last
year. It did not have

139
00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:03.970
a DVI port on it.
And they basically said, no,

140
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.540
they're using all all using
HTMI now. But my brother's

141
00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:10.210
got an older one with
DVI, which he just right

142
00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:12.760
out of the video card
from his computer. Cause it's

143
00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:16.150
got a DBI out blank.
I have to use a

144
00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:21.040
transcoder Well, so interestingly though,
DVI and HD are pinout

145
00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:24.910
compatible. If you have DVI
content, you can just buy

146
00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:27.880
a regular DVI cable, go
to radio shack and get

147
00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:31.240
a DVI to HTMI adapter
transcoder and it'll just plug

148
00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.970
in directly. Oh, that's cool
to know DVI and HTMI

149
00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:37.630
are actually pinout compatible. Wow.
Yeah. It's just that it's

150
00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:41.050
a smaller container. So I
have DVI output coming from

151
00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:47.470
my Motorola DVR, going directly
into a, a male DVI

152
00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:51.010
to male HTMI adapter. It
looks like an old, you

153
00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:52.600
know what that looks like.
It looks like a 25

154
00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:55.770
pin serial to nine pin
serial adapter. It was like

155
00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:58.680
20 bucks at radio shack.
And it'll actually take that

156
00:08:58.680 --> 00:08:59.760
on a Mac and you
won't have to do any

157
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:03.510
transcoding and it doesn't interfere
with the signal. No, it

158
00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:06.300
doesn't. Cause it's literally just
connecting pins to pins. It's

159
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:08.430
digital. Now this is why
I do that. So you

160
00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:10.890
might say I have a,
a, an, a sharp LCD

161
00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:14.430
in Aqua is LCD that
supports this new HTMI format.

162
00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:16.220
Yeah, I have, but I
have one of those too.

163
00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:19.790
Yeah. So, so you might
wonder why I'm running HTMI

164
00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:22.400
is gonna be why I'm
running DVI. Actually, I ended

165
00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:25.220
up moving away from HTMI
a couple of months ago,

166
00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:30.320
there is a bug in
this particular Motorola DVR, and

167
00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.820
you may have this depending
on the version of the

168
00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:36.350
firmware that you have, that
you only get 5.1 Dolby

169
00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:40.760
surround sound through the optical
when you're plugged into HTMI.

170
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.590
When you're watching live TV,
really? So on your DVR,

171
00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:48.170
go to watch a live
HD channel. So you're watching

172
00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:52.820
it absolutely live. You'll be
getting 5.1 Dolby. Now back

173
00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:55.640
up, just back up 20
seconds. So then you're watching

174
00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:59.210
data. That's coming off of
the hard drive. You will

175
00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:03.380
switch back to Dolby two,
not 5.1. Your optical will

176
00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:07.100
turn off and you'll go
back to a straight sound

177
00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:09.830
and you won't get back
your full 5.1 until you

178
00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:12.470
go live again. This is
a known bug in the

179
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:16.610
version 0.2 to firmware of
the Motorola, 65, 12. Oh,

180
00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:19.640
not good. And this is
representative of the state of

181
00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:21.440
affairs. I mean, here's a,
you know, here we are

182
00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:24.140
on a podcast talking about
an obscure bug. People who

183
00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:25.970
are paying attention and really
want to have the best

184
00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:29.420
quality will notice this and,
and recognize this on their

185
00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:35.990
Motorola 65 twelves Looking at
the I'm looking@thepictureonabroadbandatmotorola.com DVR, what

186
00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:39.020
is the shrinks due to
that? The motor strength Yar

187
00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:42.410
is at shrinks shrinker slash
I T J. And that

188
00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:46.700
definitely is the one I
have now is this bug

189
00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:48.380
fixable, is there a fix
for it or is it,

190
00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:50.390
So it turns out that
the 0.2, three version of

191
00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:52.760
the firmware has that, but
only some markets have chosen

192
00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:55.430
to roll that out. So
you can go into your,

193
00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:57.800
you know, your about box
in the menu somewhere and

194
00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.870
see that or not. But
if you search for deep

195
00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:02.180
for, for this, this bug
on Google, you'll find it.

196
00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:05.930
And this actually made me
switch over to not using

197
00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:08.480
HTMI cause it was so
frustrating and it had something

198
00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:11.870
to do with this particular
device was unable to spit

199
00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:15.920
out the audio through the
HTMI and through the optical

200
00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:19.730
at the same exact time.
Now Me I'm using optical

201
00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:22.100
for audio in HTMI for
video. Is that going to

202
00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:25.910
affect me? It will affect
you because this particular device,

203
00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:30.470
when you're live outputs, the
full 5.1 through both HTMI

204
00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:35.330
and through the optical. Okay.
Back up, it doesn't either.

205
00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.270
It doesn't either. So it's,
it's just, it's an example

206
00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:41.900
of the confusion. So interestingly,
while the studios want us

207
00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:45.170
using this new cable format
to transmit our video and

208
00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:50.210
protected, protected content, and plus
audio, most people are buying

209
00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:53.680
monitors and LCDs and plasmas
and flat screens that don't

210
00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:56.500
really have great speakers on
them, right? So they're not

211
00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:58.450
going to bother using HTML.
They're going to go and

212
00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:01.990
use optical like, like you
and I are, which is

213
00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:03.880
going to be really interesting
to see if people are

214
00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:06.700
going to embrace a single
cable solution for all of

215
00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:10.240
their, all of their issues.
So let's get back to

216
00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:15.070
kind of talking about H
HDTV formats. So DVDs spit

217
00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:20.590
out for ADP. That's not
high Def okay. So HD

218
00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:25.420
by definition is at minimally
720 lines. So that's 1280

219
00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:28.570
by seven 20 in a,
you know, in VGA speak,

220
00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:30.520
right? Actually people usually refer
to it in terms of

221
00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:34.540
horizontal lines, but within the
context of a computers, we'll

222
00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:37.930
say it's 1280 by seven
20, and then progressive means

223
00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:41.260
that the lines are painted
top to bottom. So that's

224
00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.990
what the P in seven
20 P means versus something

225
00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:47.020
like 10 80, I, where
you're going to get interlaced

226
00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:48.820
first, you're going to get
every other, you know, like

227
00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:50.710
at the odd numbered lines.
And then you'll come back

228
00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:54.340
later and you'll get the
even numbered lines. Typically progressive

229
00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:57.670
is considered to be a,
a more fluid and less

230
00:12:57.670 --> 00:13:01.690
likely to cause trouble with
horizontal movements, like action movies,

231
00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:03.640
where someone's running from left
to right. Really, really fast,

232
00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:07.330
right. Sometimes you'll see those,
those interlaced things. Now the

233
00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:10.330
pinnacle of HD is going
to be 10 80 P

234
00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:12.880
and that's the one that
all the geeks are talking

235
00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:16.330
about now, but there's really
no 10 80 P content

236
00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:19.860
out there. Now what is,
as far as I'm concerned,

237
00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:27.960
discovery HD is the most
consistently good looking channel on

238
00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:31.200
my body. Exactly. So that's
the showcase channel. This is

239
00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:34.170
the channel where the cable
guys have decided that we'll

240
00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:39.540
compress this channel the least,
right? Because HD, for those

241
00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:42.420
of us who know what
JPEG and MPEG artifacts look

242
00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:45.150
like can walk up to
an HDTV and get close

243
00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:47.520
and go, wow, this looks
like they've got, you know,

244
00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:48.930
we, we used to call
these, you know, just Jay

245
00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:51.210
Peggy, this is a very
Jay Peggy screen. It's got

246
00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:53.910
the jaggies because they're squishing
the hell out of it.

247
00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:56.580
They're trying to fit that
very, very large amount of

248
00:13:56.580 --> 00:14:01.500
information in a very, very
small pipe. So the discovery

249
00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:04.860
channel has very low compression
at Mo in most American

250
00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:08.370
cable companies. I don't know
how that is overseas, but

251
00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:10.740
if you look at certain
channels, like I've found that

252
00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:14.310
Fox really squishes the heck
out of their stuff. Additionally,

253
00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:18.900
Turner networking TNT has a
really lousy HD here in

254
00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:21.960
the States. There's various levels
of compression. It's up to

255
00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:24.780
the cable company to do
that. I've heard also, and

256
00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:27.900
this is just anecdotally that
a number of satellite channels

257
00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:31.530
don't have very high quality
a HD either, but the

258
00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:33.450
discovery channel seems to be
the one that they want

259
00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:35.520
to show people off. That's
the one you'll see at

260
00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:38.490
the HD store. When you
go buy one, That's what

261
00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:41.340
was playing. When I, when
I was checking out this,

262
00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:45.270
it's just, we actually have
a public television station in

263
00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:49.470
Connecticut that it's CCTV and
they have a high Def

264
00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:53.270
channel, which is interesting. And,
and, but the thing that

265
00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:56.840
really makes me mad is
that during the day it

266
00:14:56.840 --> 00:15:02.610
works great at night, it
just stops working. And I,

267
00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:06.440
I'm not sure if that's
planned or not, but it

268
00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:09.110
seems like signal. Yeah. There's
no signal coming through. So

269
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:12.790
we get Barney in high
Def. But when you, when

270
00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:14.810
all I want to see
Nova or something like that,

271
00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:17.890
Oh, no, we can't show
that. Yeah, certainly it doesn't

272
00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:19.750
have anything to HD as
a protocol. I would be

273
00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:21.580
interested in finding out what's
going on with that. We

274
00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:24.250
have a local public television
station here that could OPB

275
00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:27.820
Oregon public broadcasting that has
a rock and sweet HD.

276
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.950
And we just got on
our new Comcast here on

277
00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:32.020
the West coast. We just
got MTV and high death.

278
00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:35.350
Wow. And MTV, and high-def
uses a little bit less

279
00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:38.200
compression, but this is all
something I can't measure. Right.

280
00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:40.330
This is just based on,
on gut. You look at

281
00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:43.720
this after you've looked at
an NFL, it doesn't quite

282
00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:47.320
feel right. It's just like
watching a really poorly encoded

283
00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:50.170
DVD versus a really nice
and coated one. It also

284
00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:53.200
depends on looking at DVDs
and then talking about HD

285
00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:56.710
DVDs, whether or not the
person has put thought whoever's

286
00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:58.120
in of this to put
a great deal of thought

287
00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:00.190
into the encoding and whether
or not they try to

288
00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:03.970
squish it into a single
layer or two layers. Now

289
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.620
coming soon as the HD
DVDs or Blu-ray, there's two

290
00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:12.250
different competing formats here. We've
got a new hi-def DVD.

291
00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:15.700
This is the one Microsoft
supporting. They've got the HD

292
00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:19.660
DVD player coming out this
Christmas for the Xbox three

293
00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:22.510
60. So it appears that
unless you want to spend

294
00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:27.310
six, seven, 800 bucks on
a HD DVD player to

295
00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:29.770
sheep has got one. You
can just buy an Xbox

296
00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:31.780
three 60. You can get
those cheaper and cheaper now,

297
00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:35.050
and then get the $200
add on HD DVD player.

298
00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:37.120
Wow. Now Sony is going
to come up with a

299
00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:39.640
one COVID, which is supporting
the alternative format called blue

300
00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:43.510
Ray. And that'll be in
the Sony PlayStation blue Ray

301
00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:47.890
supports 25 gigs per single
layer while HD DVD supports

302
00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:50.590
15 gigs per single layer.
I also heard that they're

303
00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:55.270
coming out where there is
failing. Actually didn't really work

304
00:16:55.270 --> 00:17:00.580
is a new high Def
CD format, audio CD only,

305
00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:04.600
but it turns out that,
you know, only two people

306
00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:07.690
really care about it. Seeing
his house CD quality is

307
00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:10.390
pretty near damn near perfect
with the a to D

308
00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:14.110
converters that you get in,
even the cheapest CD players

309
00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:16.420
these days, Right. They've been
trying to push, there was

310
00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:19.600
a series CD. Then there
was SACD super audio CD,

311
00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:23.950
right? They died within, yeah.
Now within DVDs, they're, they're

312
00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:29.470
sending out 24 bit 90,
96 kilohertz data rather than

313
00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:34.750
44 kilohertz. I've got a
story for you. Roger Nichols, who

314
00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:39.430
engineered steely, Dan going back
and going back through the

315
00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:43.630
years. And most recently, anyway,
not most recently, but he,

316
00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:45.940
one of the steely Dan
albums that he engineered was

317
00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:47.650
to against nature. This is
the one they want a

318
00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:50.310
Grammy for when they came,
you know, from the dead

319
00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:54.840
for last 17 years or
whatever. And this won a

320
00:17:54.840 --> 00:18:00.630
Grammy, it's a wonderful sounding
CD. And he, you know,

321
00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:04.290
there's big debate on the
audio engineering forms about 24

322
00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:08.670
96 versus CD quality, 16
blah, blah, blah. The, basically

323
00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:12.930
the entire industry recording industry
is pushing 24 96. So

324
00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:16.290
Nichols is like, you know,
I've got golden years. I

325
00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:19.110
couldn't hear the difference between
anything. And here's what they

326
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:24.900
did. They actually recorded and
mixed simultaneously this album in

327
00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:28.560
24 96 and in good
old 16 bit 44, one

328
00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:32.700
stereo. And at the end
of the day, when they

329
00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:35.340
were listening to the mixes,
nobody in the studio could

330
00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:38.640
tell the difference. They did
an AB blindfold test, not

331
00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:41.370
even Roger Nichols, nobody in the
studio could tell the difference

332
00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:44.810
between the two. Yeah. Until
you start talking about compression,

333
00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:47.600
you know, I mean, it's
really about, it's really about

334
00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:51.410
dynamic range, right? And you're
basically saying that uncompressed data

335
00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:56.030
at these different sampling rates
was not distinguishable within this,

336
00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:58.510
this, this range and with
this amount of resolution. Yeah.

337
00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:01.730
Not just dynamic range, but
frequency range. The, you know,

338
00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:05.390
the, the human ear can
only hear to what, not

339
00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:10.370
even to 30 K and
so 40, 41 is, you

340
00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:14.960
know, way beyond that. And
so, so it really it's,

341
00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:17.090
you know, when you hear
people say, Oh, I can

342
00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:19.850
tell the difference. You know,
I, I questioned them. I

343
00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:22.880
mean, if Roger Nichols can't tell
the difference and the guy's

344
00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:25.310
got the best years in
the industry, I do think

345
00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:28.100
that people can tell the
difference in compression though. Okay.

346
00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:31.310
Depression. Absolutely. I could tell
you an MP3 versus a

347
00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:33.590
wave. Oh yeah. Sure. A
lot of people feel very

348
00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:38.840
strongly about not buying music
from iTunes. And presumably that

349
00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:40.160
we're going to see this
where people won't want to

350
00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:42.620
buy a movie in a
compressed format because they're feeling

351
00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:46.130
that they're buying data that's
already broken. Right, right. As

352
00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:48.950
opposed to buying a CD
and then squishing it yourself,

353
00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:52.460
you've got the pure wave
as opposed to buying a

354
00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:54.980
copy of the copy. Plus
you'll feel like buying MP3

355
00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:58.610
is like buying a mixed
tape. It's true. And especially,

356
00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:02.600
you know, especially, well, heck
we encode this at 96

357
00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:06.290
K you know, that not
all right. This is the

358
00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:09.440
bit rate for the MP3
and coding 96 K. Right.

359
00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:12.950
And it's really good for
speech, not so great for,

360
00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:15.980
for audio. You could tell
in the music, you know,

361
00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:17.900
if you're listening closely, you
can tell the music in

362
00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:20.570
the beginning is a little
artifacting. So it's right on

363
00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:24.050
the border of what's acceptable
to me anyway, as you

364
00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:28.220
know, producer Now, interestingly though,
while people feel very, very

365
00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:32.420
strongly about their audio, there's
a lot of discussion about

366
00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:36.110
whether people care about these
higher resolutions, you know, it's,

367
00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:38.330
it is my opinion. And
I think the opinion of

368
00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:42.890
most folks who think about
this stuff that seven 20

369
00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:47.350
P is a perfectly reasonable
resolution. And there are those

370
00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:49.420
that feel that for ADP,
the resolution you see in

371
00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:52.930
a DVD is totally reasonable
as well. Now there are

372
00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:55.990
some calculators that you can
look at online that will

373
00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:58.120
take the distance that you
sit in, in the size

374
00:20:58.120 --> 00:20:59.800
of the screen, and then
tell you whether or not

375
00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:02.350
you could possibly notice because
you know, the human eye

376
00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:04.810
has a certain resolution. I
remember someone calculating it at

377
00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:07.000
something like, you know, if
you could give someone an

378
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.540
image that was like 4,096,
by 4,096, that's basically the

379
00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:12.910
resolution of the human eye
with the best, with the

380
00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:16.210
best eyesight. Right. Exactly. Something
like that. I mean, there's

381
00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:18.340
only so many rods and
cones in the back of

382
00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:21.640
your eye, right? So this
viewing distance calculator, and there's

383
00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:23.980
one of them at shrink
stir slash I T E

384
00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:27.700
that would let you basically
say at the, at a

385
00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:30.130
distance of 12 feet from
a 32 inch high Def

386
00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:32.170
screen, you should not physically
be able to tell the

387
00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:35.890
difference between four 80 and
seven 20, because the pixels

388
00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:38.560
are just, are only done
in a certain way. Now,

389
00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:40.450
one thing that's important to
remember, of course, when we're

390
00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:44.080
talking about things like LCDs
or any display, that's a

391
00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:48.280
fixed pixel display, whether you're
watching it in my picks,

392
00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:52.300
my, my display has, has
1280. No, I think it's

393
00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:58.360
actually 1378 by 1678. It's
a fixed pixel. Okay. If

394
00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:01.780
I'm watching four 80 P
content off of a DVD

395
00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:05.020
and I'm watching it at
the native resolution, they're going

396
00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:08.890
to up sample it regardless.
Right? Right. So I want

397
00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:11.860
to pick a resolution that
is the closest to what

398
00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:14.080
I would ordinarily want to
watch. Right? This is why

399
00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:17.650
a lot of HD TV
enthusiasts are saying that there's

400
00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:20.020
a resurgence in the CRTs.
A lot of the new

401
00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:24.700
Sony cathode Ray tubes, the
old, the old way of

402
00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:27.400
doing things is actually a
better way to watch HD.

403
00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:30.040
And with some of these
short throat CRTs, you can

404
00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:34.510
get really thin, very, not,
not very deep, but quite

405
00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:39.580
heavy glass flat tubes and
get some really amazing screens

406
00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:42.010
because there's no fixed pixel.
It'll show you the resolution

407
00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:45.160
that the resolution that it
was encoded in a while.

408
00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:47.650
I'm always, even if I
watch 10 80, I can't

409
00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:50.680
right. It's just going to
downgrade it to seven 68,

410
00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:53.950
which is what my, my
LCD supports by default, you

411
00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:56.650
get the same effect when
you're not using your computer

412
00:22:56.650 --> 00:23:00.490
monitored, the full resolution. Exactly.
Now there's a great picture

413
00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:05.110
up on Wikipedia at shrink
stir slash I T H,

414
00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:08.620
that will show you the
different resolutions and what we're

415
00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:11.980
talking about here. The idea
that the difference between four

416
00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:14.860
80 P what a typical
DVD spits out in seven

417
00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:19.060
20, what a typical HD
TVD can handle is four

418
00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:22.780
X. You're looking at four
X improvement in quality. We're

419
00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:25.840
talking about like four times
as many pixels. Wow. While

420
00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:28.480
if you look at like
a 10 80 I, or

421
00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:32.020
Trinity P it's, it's almost
that much more jumped up.

422
00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:34.840
You're getting a hell of
a lot more pixels out

423
00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:37.780
of a, a screen. So,
you know, six 40 by

424
00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:41.500
four 80, basically the kind
of th that people kind

425
00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:44.650
of say that NTSC, that
the U S style or

426
00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:48.590
pal the European or African
style or sea cam, what

427
00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:51.650
they used in France for
awhile were basically, they're kind

428
00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:54.620
of the four 80 ilk
plus or minus. I mean,

429
00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:56.030
some of them, like, I
think C cam could do

430
00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:58.700
like five 20. And, but
for the most part, this

431
00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:02.720
is just what they call
SD TV standard definition. Yeah,

432
00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:08.120
exactly. Now, one of the
issues that I'm running into

433
00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:11.750
is that I, since I
hate my Motorola, but I

434
00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:14.720
like my premium channels is
how do I get away

435
00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:18.290
from my cable company? I
want the, the pipe from

436
00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:20.030
the cable company, or I
want the pipe from the

437
00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:22.670
satellite dish company, but I
don't want the baggage of

438
00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:25.040
their crappy box. So you
want to get a card

439
00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:28.760
for your computer that has
HTMI inputs, right? Well, but

440
00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:32.000
I want to have HBO
and the cable company or

441
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.790
the satellite company <inaudible>. So
this is where cable card

442
00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:40.370
comes in. And there's information
in Wikipedia at shrink stir

443
00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:43.820
slash ITF. And this is
basically a smart card for

444
00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:46.220
your cable company that allow
it to it's a specification

445
00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:49.610
that allows them to identify
you uniquely and decode some

446
00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:52.790
of that premium content. Now,
what that doesn't allow you

447
00:24:52.790 --> 00:24:54.920
to do is get some
of the on demand or

448
00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:58.220
two way communication that a
lot of the cable companies

449
00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:01.580
enjoy. Comcast has this notion
of on demand where I

450
00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:03.920
can watch a high Def
movie and have it streamed

451
00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:07.310
to me, cable card, doesn't
support that it would support

452
00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:10.430
letting me watch Showtime or
HBO, but not those other

453
00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:13.790
things. So it's going to
be 2007 or 2008 before

454
00:25:13.790 --> 00:25:18.620
we can do that. But
Invista, they say about this

455
00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:22.340
time next year, actually probably
spring next year, even earlier,

456
00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:25.490
you'll be able to plug
cable card into the back

457
00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:28.250
of one of these cars.
Like you just described an

458
00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:32.390
HDTV card for Vista, and
probably a listener will send

459
00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:35.600
me a link to one
that already exists, but you

460
00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:38.510
could get as many cable
cards as you have tuners.

461
00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:41.060
And these would help you
help the cable company, identify

462
00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:44.750
you and give you high
Def content over the cable,

463
00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:48.260
and also get the premium
channels that you would be

464
00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:50.750
giving up. If you did
it today, Scott, whatever happened

465
00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:54.730
to TiVo. Well, so TiVo
kinda was kinda quiet for

466
00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:57.950
awhile because interestingly, we thought
that TiVo was going to

467
00:25:57.950 --> 00:26:02.120
be taking over. And all
of the, all the cable

468
00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:05.660
companies would give us DeVos,
but DVR technology was such

469
00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:07.610
an obvious idea, and it
wasn't really something that was

470
00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:12.440
patentable T voted lost out
in this Motorola. It seems

471
00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:14.900
to be the one that
everyone's using TiVo just came

472
00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:18.140
out with an IHD DVR
TiVo. I think it's series

473
00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:22.130
three. And you can hear
about that shrinker slash ITI.

474
00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:29.600
This is $800. It's got
dual hi-def tuners, but it's

475
00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:34.640
$800. Now my Comcast is
15 bucks a month or

476
00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:37.460
five bucks a month for
a rental. Now I hate

477
00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:40.040
it with the heat of
a thousand suns. And it's

478
00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:44.490
a steaming pile of poo,
but it's not 800 bucks.

479
00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:48.600
You know, I enjoy my
TV, but I don't enjoy

480
00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:49.920
it that much, that I'm
going to be such a

481
00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:52.320
TiVo fan that I need
to have the little thumbs

482
00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:55.290
up, thumbs down. So, you
know, I just don't see

483
00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:58.790
it. And that's 800 bucks
before the TiVo subscription. Now

484
00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:02.810
the Motorola does have, I
saw a, like a USB

485
00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:05.180
connector for an external hard
drive. Is that what that's

486
00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:09.050
for? So It's got that.
And, but it's not enabled

487
00:27:09.050 --> 00:27:10.970
in the firmware, right? So
the Motorola has got a

488
00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:13.070
lot of really cool stuff.
A lot of these devices

489
00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:15.860
came out with USB or
with FireWire connectors and they

490
00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:18.500
just haven't turned them on
yet. They assure us that

491
00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:20.330
they will be turned on
because one of the first

492
00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:22.400
things I'd like to do
with my Motorola is extend

493
00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:24.950
the hard drive right now
it's got 160 gig drive,

494
00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:28.220
120 to 120. I can
barely get 18 hours of

495
00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:31.880
HD on the thing, right?
So I'm constantly chasing stuff.

496
00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:34.340
We like to save an
entire season and wash it

497
00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:37.880
at our leisure. Absolutely. We
don't believe in appointment TV.

498
00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:39.380
I'm not going to rush
home. You know, I don't

499
00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:43.130
know when, when houses on
the show, I like watching

500
00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:46.250
now his house and my
wife, it might be Mondays.

501
00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:47.750
I don't know. I watch
it when it's on the

502
00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:50.540
thing, right? Whenever it shows
up, they might watch two

503
00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:53.090
in a row. So I
like to be able to

504
00:27:53.090 --> 00:27:55.400
keep a lot of this
information. And I'm really surprised

505
00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:57.980
at the poultry sizes of
hard drives. I'd love to

506
00:27:57.980 --> 00:27:59.450
hook up a terabyte and
see what I could do

507
00:27:59.450 --> 00:28:02.960
with that. Now there's a
couple of really good links

508
00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:05.570
to point folks at in
case I got things wrong.

509
00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:08.780
There's how stuff works, has
got a thing on HDTV,

510
00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:13.010
shrink, stir slash it. D
as in David a and

511
00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:15.290
then what were the, one
of the websites, the blogs

512
00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:18.110
that I read for information
about high Def and what's

513
00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:20.540
on high Def this week
in, at least in the

514
00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:24.670
States is N gadget HD,
which is at shrink stir

515
00:28:24.670 --> 00:28:28.040
slash ITL. And this is
a site that used to

516
00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:30.920
be called high Def beat
or HD beat. And now

517
00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:33.020
it's part of end gadget,
which is a great website

518
00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:36.170
in itself. And this will
tell you, what's playing in

519
00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:39.740
the States on this particular
day and what resolution it's

520
00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:42.410
running at and whether or
not they really think it's

521
00:28:42.410 --> 00:28:44.750
worth. You're watching as a,
as a high Def person.

522
00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:46.460
Because one of the things
that you'll hear just like

523
00:28:46.910 --> 00:28:50.030
iPods have changed our lives
and GPS has changed our

524
00:28:50.030 --> 00:28:52.100
lives. And I mean, changed
our lives in this more

525
00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:55.130
fundamental way. I mean, if
you get an iPod, people

526
00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:57.140
say that it just changed.
It gives your life a

527
00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:59.960
soundtrack, right? It changes everything.
You get a GPS, you

528
00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:02.330
don't get lost anymore. You
get a TiVo or a

529
00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:05.270
replay or a DVR. It,
it changes the way you

530
00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:08.300
watch TV. You watch more
of the shows you want

531
00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:10.730
and less yeah. It's commercials
not flipping through crap. Yeah.

532
00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:12.770
D is one of these
things. I think it was

533
00:29:12.770 --> 00:29:14.510
interesting. The first thing you
said when I asked if

534
00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:17.870
you had HD, was that
w you only watched HD,

535
00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:22.160
right. Physically it's physically difficult
to watch standard definition TV,

536
00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:24.890
right? You'd much rather watch
a sunset on the discovery

537
00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:27.590
channel. Exactly. That's what I'd
rather watch it. If, of

538
00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:29.870
course, if there's something that's
only on and on HD

539
00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:31.580
that I really want to
see, I'll watch it. But

540
00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:34.130
when I go to record
my shows for the week,

541
00:29:34.130 --> 00:29:37.040
most of them are on
discovery HD. Yeah. Isn't that

542
00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:39.560
interesting. Now, there are some
channels that try to fool

543
00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:43.810
us. Like when Fox coming
up before HD, when Fox

544
00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:46.240
was still a new network,
they came up with this

545
00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:50.590
thing called Fox widescreen, which
was basically digital four 80

546
00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:55.540
a widescreen TV, but it's
not high definition shrink stir

547
00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:58.360
slash I T H. So
you really have to watch

548
00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:01.000
that little, that little blurb
at the beginning of the

549
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.280
show to tell you whether
or not what you're watching

550
00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:06.430
is potentially available in high
Def or not. And depending

551
00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:08.680
on what market you live
in, you may not be

552
00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:13.330
able to find those shows.
For example, CVS here in,

553
00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:16.030
in Oregon was not available
for a number of years

554
00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:19.720
in high-def because of an
ongoing feud between the high

555
00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:24.850
Def feed owner and the
com and the Comcast cable

556
00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:28.450
operator. They wanted to charge
Comcast didn't want to pay.

557
00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:32.140
We had every network in
the States in hi-def except

558
00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:36.430
this one. So interestingly high-def
enthusiast simply stopped watching that

559
00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:40.620
channel. Now, of course, I
do watch baseball on a

560
00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:43.650
Nesson the new England sports
network and watch the red

561
00:30:43.650 --> 00:30:47.070
Sox in high Def. That
is an amazing experience. And

562
00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:50.430
of course, ESPN has their,
Yeah. Interestingly, I'm totally not

563
00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:53.280
a sports person. I could
really care less. I couldn't

564
00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:55.470
care less actually, but you
know, every once in a

565
00:30:55.470 --> 00:30:57.710
while, I'll I'll come on
and I'll see a, a,

566
00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:00.690
a, a football game trying
to think of the name

567
00:31:00.690 --> 00:31:02.160
of the sport there for
a second. Almost slipped my

568
00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:04.620
mind. Yeah. You know, big
guys with helmets. Well, the

569
00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:08.760
baseball myself personally, much to
Huckabee's chagrin, he's trying to

570
00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:11.130
get me to watch more
football and soccer and stuff.

571
00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:14.640
Tim Huckabee probably has a
very large high definition screen.

572
00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:18.000
If I know him well,
I will watch sports just

573
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.480
because it's in such clarity,
particularly tennis is really just

574
00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:23.910
amazing. Yeah. I mean, you
can see the faces of

575
00:31:23.910 --> 00:31:26.310
the people in the, in
the crowd. And of course

576
00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:31.200
running any Xbox game in
hi-def is pretty amazing. I

577
00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:33.360
just want to put this
plug in there that discovery

578
00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:38.610
channel HD channel is doing
a series called Atlas HD

579
00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:41.250
in which they have taken
crews all over the world

580
00:31:41.250 --> 00:31:46.590
to make documentaries of different
cultures. And so the current

581
00:31:46.590 --> 00:31:51.330
one is on China and
the photography, the cinematography is

582
00:31:51.330 --> 00:31:56.160
just beautiful. It's unbelievable. They
they've took, took these ultra

583
00:31:56.160 --> 00:32:03.570
high resolution film of these
Buddhists amongst, I think they

584
00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:07.440
might've been Kung Fu students
that were banging drums that

585
00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:09.630
had water on them and
the water was splashing up

586
00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:13.380
and they slowed it down
and it was still slowed

587
00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:15.930
down. It was fast enough
where you could not see

588
00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:20.700
it, you know, it was
just so fluid. They also

589
00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:24.030
did the matrix. They do
the matrix style, set up

590
00:32:24.030 --> 00:32:27.000
a row of cameras, you
know, in between two video

591
00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.540
cameras and then roll everything
at once and then take

592
00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:33.870
the snapshots and then animate
them, you know, how they

593
00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:37.490
do that, that matrix move.
Did you know that? Well,

594
00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:39.710
they have, they have a
bunch of cameras on a,

595
00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:43.450
on a track, On a
track. Yeah, well basically they

596
00:32:43.450 --> 00:32:46.420
have a track of cameras
that match in resolution, the

597
00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:48.850
video cameras. They have one
video camera on one side

598
00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:51.400
and one video camera on
a 90 degree angle. And

599
00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:54.430
then this string of regular
cameras and they were all

600
00:32:54.430 --> 00:32:56.440
running at the same time.
And then they just snap

601
00:32:56.440 --> 00:33:00.010
the photos, snap the cameras
at the same time. And

602
00:33:00.010 --> 00:33:02.560
then they go back and
they make a bridge of

603
00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:07.570
frames, camera frames with the
still shots to, to walk

604
00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:09.310
from one camera to the
other. That's how they do

605
00:33:09.310 --> 00:33:11.920
that. And they're doing that.
They were doing that with

606
00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:14.620
this woman who was tossing
some rice in a pan

607
00:33:15.310 --> 00:33:17.260
and you see her on
the side and the rice

608
00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:19.990
goes up and then it
stops and then swings over

609
00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:21.940
in front of her. And
you can see it comes

610
00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:24.160
in real close and you
can see her name implies

611
00:33:24.970 --> 00:33:28.210
Atlas, D Atlas HD. I
got to check that out.

612
00:33:28.210 --> 00:33:31.330
It's unbelievable. Yeah. One last
thing that I want to

613
00:33:31.330 --> 00:33:34.360
add is that if you're
thinking about going HD, you

614
00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:36.910
really have to think about
where's your source going to

615
00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:38.650
be? Is it going to
be your satellite or your

616
00:33:38.650 --> 00:33:40.390
local cable company, or are
going to be over the

617
00:33:40.390 --> 00:33:41.950
air? Because one of the
things that we didn't mention

618
00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:44.680
is that you can just
buy an antenna to get

619
00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:46.450
back on the, get back
on the roof and pull

620
00:33:46.450 --> 00:33:48.280
HD out of the air.
There's nothing wrong with that.

621
00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:51.310
You'll just get your local
channels in HD on different,

622
00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:54.700
on different digital channels. I
did that with an ATI

623
00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:57.880
all in wonder HD, which
is a very lousy card.

624
00:33:57.940 --> 00:34:01.240
I think there's any by
any HD card except that

625
00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:05.650
one. And you'll have a
good success. The new service

626
00:34:05.650 --> 00:34:09.520
pack roll up of windows
media center in 2005 and

627
00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:13.540
or Vista ultimate support hi-def
tuners. So you can watch

628
00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:17.260
high Def and record it
on your Vista machine. But

629
00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:19.330
I would also encourage you
to think about if you're

630
00:34:19.330 --> 00:34:21.370
a, you know, kind of
an enthusiast, if you've got

631
00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:23.470
separate components, let's put it
that way. If you have

632
00:34:23.470 --> 00:34:27.340
a separate receiver, think about
D what do you want

633
00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:30.550
to do your video switching?
Do you want to plug

634
00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:33.220
all of your video, your
DVD player, your HD, your

635
00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:37.090
X-Box directly into your TV
directly into your television or

636
00:34:37.090 --> 00:34:40.570
monitor. And then that case
you're limited by the inputs

637
00:34:40.570 --> 00:34:43.780
that are available on your
particular monitor, or do you

638
00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:45.730
want to have a receiver
that's smart enough to do

639
00:34:45.730 --> 00:34:49.060
this work for you? Now,
I recently selected an onco

640
00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:52.690
receiver at shrink stir slash
it nine, because this is

641
00:34:52.690 --> 00:34:57.130
what's called an upconverting receiver.
It's a video switching receiver,

642
00:34:57.130 --> 00:34:59.740
which means that both the
video and the audio will

643
00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:02.200
switch when I select an
input on this and it

644
00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:05.440
will up convert whatever input
I give it to in

645
00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:09.430
my case HTMI, but it's
going to up convert. This

646
00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:11.950
is a difference between upscaling.
So it's still going to

647
00:35:11.950 --> 00:35:14.500
take that signal. It's going
to basically take the signal

648
00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:16.990
and put it on the
other wire, but it's not

649
00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:22.600
necessarily going to upscale. Only
very, very high quality devices

650
00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:28.780
will up, will upscale. So
meaning taking four ATP and

651
00:35:28.810 --> 00:35:32.950
turn it into seven 20,
or turn it into a

652
00:35:33.130 --> 00:35:35.920
10 80. And, and additionally,
there are actually some rules

653
00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:40.350
with the, the HTMI about
what's allowed to up convert.

654
00:35:40.410 --> 00:35:43.920
For example, the X-Box has
the capability to take a

655
00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:47.550
four ADP DVD and make
it high Def basically doing

656
00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:51.120
a, you know, re sample
it's inventing pixels, of course,

657
00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:55.350
but it would make it
more than native resolution, but

658
00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:58.230
that's not legal. You're not
allowed to do that over

659
00:35:58.230 --> 00:36:01.930
anything other than HTMI, you
can't take a, I, don't

660
00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:04.050
not quite sure whether this
is a technical rule or

661
00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:06.450
a legal rule, but they're
not allowed to take for

662
00:36:06.450 --> 00:36:08.700
ADP and turn it into
40 P and then output

663
00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:12.360
it on anything other than
this high HDCP this high

664
00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:17.670
definition, protected content protocol. But
if you're thinking about going

665
00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:19.320
HD, and you're gonna go
and spend a couple of

666
00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:22.530
grand on a, a new
monitor, think about spending a

667
00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:25.380
couple hundred bucks on a
really nice receiver that will

668
00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:28.440
do this up conversion for
you. And you'll find that

669
00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:31.500
the, the, the trouble you
have to go to, to

670
00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:34.290
switch between inputs is going
to be a lot, a

671
00:36:34.290 --> 00:36:37.920
lot diminished, a great deal.
I've found that, trying to

672
00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:41.070
change the input on my
receiver and change the input

673
00:36:41.070 --> 00:36:43.470
of my TV all with
macros has been a lot

674
00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:46.200
of a big hassle. And
I'm looking forward to hooking

675
00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:48.300
this on cue up. I
picked it up yesterday. I

676
00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:50.790
saw it at the store
doing its work, and I'll

677
00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:52.680
kind of report back on
that later on my blog,

678
00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:56.700
but be thinking about what
your video source switching strategy

679
00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:59.060
is going to be. Scott,
I have a, another thing

680
00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:01.880
to add to the mix.
I have this universal remote

681
00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:04.820
control from Phillips that has
a little LCD screen on

682
00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:10.310
it, and it basically learns
all of your setups. I

683
00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:12.890
couldn't find here just while
you were talking, I couldn't

684
00:37:12.890 --> 00:37:16.760
find a link to it,
but I found another, you

685
00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:18.980
know, I guess it's their
current line of home theater

686
00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:25.460
control panels, the Pronto, and
it's at shrink, sir.com/i T

687
00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:29.150
O not zero, but I
T O ITTO as in

688
00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:32.540
judge ITO, and I don't
know where that came from

689
00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:35.990
and it, it, it was
very cool. The one that

690
00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:39.320
I have anyway was very
cool. It just says, it

691
00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:42.200
goes through all of your
peripherals and allows you to

692
00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:45.380
hook them up. And then
you create these scenarios home,

693
00:37:46.070 --> 00:37:52.190
you know, DVD cable, stereo,
and it just creates these

694
00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:55.190
buttons on the screen. And
then you press one button

695
00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:58.190
and it turns on and
off and set it. Does

696
00:37:58.190 --> 00:37:59.770
it deal with a macro
or does it notice it

697
00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:02.180
all with a single macro?
Is it, is it, does

698
00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:03.830
it know the state of
the system? What happens if

699
00:38:03.830 --> 00:38:05.810
someone walks in front of
them? That has been the

700
00:38:05.810 --> 00:38:08.060
only problem that's been the
only problem with this thing,

701
00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:10.880
it doesn't get feedback in
terms of, you know, what

702
00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:13.700
the current state is. So
if you have any kind

703
00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:16.670
of toggle switches and they
get out of sync, then

704
00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:19.610
you have to get up
and flip the switch manually.

705
00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:23.270
So I use a harmony
eight 80 remote control. I've

706
00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:27.100
got a review at shrink
stir slash ITP, and the

707
00:38:27.110 --> 00:38:29.990
harmony is a similar device.
It's got a color screen

708
00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:33.230
and except you use a
website to configure it. You

709
00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:35.980
actually go online, you walk
through a wizard and then

710
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:38.770
you download a packet using
a USB cable into the

711
00:38:38.770 --> 00:38:42.460
device. And it does similar
things. You can say, activity,

712
00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:45.460
watch a DVD, and it'll
do whatever it takes, but

713
00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:47.620
it's kind of like, this
is going to be an

714
00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:51.040
obscure Microsoft reference, but it's
kind of like MSI for

715
00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:55.360
remote controls because like MSI,
installer technology, isn't really a

716
00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:59.200
series of procedural descriptions, like
do this, like macro is,

717
00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:01.510
it's a description of the
state that you'd like it

718
00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:04.060
to be in. That's nice.
So what it does is

719
00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:06.250
it says, knowing what I
know about the system, I

720
00:39:06.250 --> 00:39:08.170
will put it into this
state. And then if you

721
00:39:08.170 --> 00:39:10.600
get confused, say a kid
walks in front of the

722
00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:14.470
remote, you can say help.
And it'll then say, is

723
00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:16.990
the TV on yes or
no? And it'll walk you

724
00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:19.660
through a host and then
resync, the state it'll have

725
00:39:20.170 --> 00:39:22.810
the Phillips has that too.
It does have that control.

726
00:39:22.810 --> 00:39:26.050
But I mean, there isn't
any substitute for actually having

727
00:39:26.050 --> 00:39:28.410
the thing, know what the
current state is, which exam,

728
00:39:28.410 --> 00:39:31.750
unless you have discreet inputs,
right? So in, in the

729
00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:34.780
parlance of infrared, remote controls,
that discreet input is the

730
00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:39.580
ability to say not toggle
power, but turn on, switch

731
00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:42.190
to input one. That's another
thing to be thinking about.

732
00:39:42.190 --> 00:39:43.900
If you do want to
put together a complete home

733
00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:46.510
theater system, that if, if
every device you have has

734
00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:49.510
a discreet input, then your
switching experience will be, will

735
00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:51.400
be much nicer. That's the
one thing that I hate

736
00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:54.700
about my sharp Aqua is
that the Aqua LCD does

737
00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:57.100
not include discreet inputs. So
I have to go through

738
00:39:57.100 --> 00:39:59.260
some macro trouble, which is
one of the reasons that

739
00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:02.080
I selected a video switching
receiver in the first place.

740
00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:06.010
Very good. Is that a
show Scott, that was a

741
00:40:06.010 --> 00:40:10.900
random collection of geeks talking
about, about TVs. Very cool.

742
00:40:11.290 --> 00:40:13.270
We have to revisit this
topic every once in a

743
00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:16.930
while because the technology changes,
obviously I agree. Looking forward

744
00:40:16.930 --> 00:40:19.300
to the next time we
talked about it until then,

745
00:40:20.110 --> 00:40:22.330
we'll see you next week
on Hansel minutes.
