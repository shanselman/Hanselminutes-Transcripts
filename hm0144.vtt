and homemaker from Zimbabwe. Hi,
this is Scott Hanselman and

10
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.130
this is another episode of
Hansel minutes, week three in

11
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.670
Africa, actually a week three
plus one, we just got

12
00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.240
back from Africa. Yesterday, got
off the plane rolled immediately

13
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.510
into bed. Very, very, very
jet lagged. We were going

14
00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.360
to do a couple more
interviews from Africa, but a

15
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.700
couple of people dropped out
at the last minute. So

16
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.870
instead we're talking to my
wife. Hi, small wife. Hi,

17
00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.900
how are you? I'm very
well. How are you? No

18
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.410
fine. I'm glad. So small
wife. This is a, this

19
00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.480
is my podcast, by the
way. We've never done a

20
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.540
show with me before and
I, It's pretty interesting to

21
00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.580
see it from this side.
You know, all I usually

22
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.920
hear it's get out, get
out of recording, stay quiet,

23
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.960
you know, gag the kids.
If you have to, for

24
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.420
the love of God, keep
it down, But debit. Now

25
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.100
you have to hold the
microphone in your hand yourself.

26
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.610
Oh, okay. So yeah. Keep
it close. How do I

27
00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.260
sound? You sound fine here.
So what is your name?

28
00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.670
Love? So, okay. My name
is <inaudible>, but I go

29
00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.670
by Mo because I call
you because you call me

30
00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.520
and people always ask me,
they're like, wow, how do

31
00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.130
you go from dementia tomorrow?
Well, the mole is part

32
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.310
of my middle name. Allah.
Yeah. And so you grew

33
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.980
too lazy to say Mola.
Cause those two silvers was

34
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.280
such hard work and <inaudible>
I find it strange when

35
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.130
I call you and Tom
Benchley, that's made bizarre or

36
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.780
weird. So, so you're an
end belly I am. And

37
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.750
that is a tribe in
Zimbabwe. That is correct. Yes.

38
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.050
And we've got family spread
all over the, all over

39
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.410
the world. We've got people
who have immigrated to Tanzania.

40
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.710
We've got people who've immigrated
to the, the U S

41
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.720
like yourself. You became a
citizen a couple of years

42
00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.350
ago. We've got people who've
immigrated to South Africa and work

43
00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.640
there. And we had a
reunion this last couple of

44
00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.030
weeks. You are four of
seven. And when you always

45
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.190
say four seven, I don't
know if people know that

46
00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.700
you mean the fourth child
of seven. Yes. Yes. Well,

47
00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.100
I mean, people who watch
star Trek will recognize what,

48
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.270
what that means, but yes,
you are four of seven.

49
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.120
You're not seven of nine,
seven of nine. You're four

50
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.750
of seven, Which I always
say it's like, it's at

51
00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.610
nine 11. Exactly. No, you're,
you're four of seven. So

52
00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.980
we went and we, we
stayed in the house of

53
00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.760
two of seven and, and
spend time with, with the

54
00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.790
other six or seven. Right?
So you are coming up

55
00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.420
on your, what I'm calling
your halvsies party, which is

56
00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.810
when you will have been
half here and half there,

57
00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.390
which I think is a
particularly interesting thing. You came

58
00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.600
to the States when 92.
Yeah. So that's what it

59
00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.450
was that you were 18,
18. So you're coming up

60
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.750
on the half and half.
And you came to Las

61
00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.650
Vegas. When you came here,
New Mexico, Las Vegas, New Mexico, were

62
00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.950
you disappointed? I was, I
thought I was being kidnapped.

63
00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.720
I think I told you
this, that, you know, when

64
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.290
I heard Las Vegas, I
was expecting Nevada. And imagine

65
00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.370
my surprise when I got
tiny, tiny Las Vegas, New Mexico

66
00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.860
that I had never heard
of. And I immediately thought

67
00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.760
I'm being kidnapped. Oh God,
I did. I did. I

68
00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.000
mean, I just bamboozled and
somehow I could not imagine

69
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.700
a country having two cities
with the same name. It

70
00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.140
was bizarre, strange. So who
does that? You know, so,

71
00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.880
Well, we do 18 there's
18 Portland's I stopped counting

72
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.600
up to three. I was
like, okay. So, and this

73
00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.270
has been an interesting thing
in our relationship. I think

74
00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.540
because people usually say, Oh,
well, you know, you're white

75
00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.030
and your wife's black. You
must have lots of trouble

76
00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.490
with color and this and
that. And I've always said,

77
00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.800
you might as well be
purple. The fact is that

78
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.060
you're, you're African and it's
the cultural differences that are

79
00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.340
the trouble. Many of you
is as color, been an

80
00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:46.350
issue for us as much
as culture, For instance, a

81
00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.660
couple less. So I think,
but, but you're right. I

82
00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.880
mean, people see us and
they see the obvious stuff

83
00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.120
first, obviously. Right? My Judy
and just the general poker

84
00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.300
today of, of cancer. That's
right. That's right. You know,

85
00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.700
they wonder, you know what
you're doing with me? And

86
00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.480
all I understand are we
taping this because I've got

87
00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:09.300
to recant, right? Yeah. They
see the skin color. But,

88
00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.610
but they, they assume like,
for example, I'll meet people

89
00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.210
who are, who are African
American in a mixed relationship

90
00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.450
with element, I assume. Yeah.
Yeah. That, and they don't

91
00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:21.510
know that, that a lot
of the stuff that we

92
00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.150
argue over really is, I
mean, cultural stuff, you know,

93
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.610
the way you were raised
and how wrong that way

94
00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.350
he is. And you know
how I'm helping you see

95
00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:31.710
the light kind of thing.
Now, you know, one of

96
00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:35.100
our very first arguments, cultural
arguments was I think one

97
00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.840
of the second or third
time we were going to

98
00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.300
see my parents, if you
remember correctly were on the

99
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.180
freeway. And I, and you
said, I said, we're going

100
00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.270
to stop by my parents.
And you said, well, we

101
00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.280
need to get something. We
need to get some bread

102
00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:49.280
because it was dinner time.
And I said, no, no,

103
00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.870
no, you don't need to
get any bread. And you

104
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.240
said, no, we're going to
get bread. Or I'm going

105
00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.590
to open the car door
and I'm going to roll

106
00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:57.290
out under the freeway and
get the bread myself. You

107
00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.440
were very strongly felt very
strongly about that. Why is

108
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.300
that so important? Actually, that,
that wasn't an African thing.

109
00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.400
That was the American thing.
I had observed that a

110
00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.350
lot of Americans, when they
come, first of all, they

111
00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:10.630
call before they come, you
know, they, they don't just

112
00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:12.880
show up, which, you know,
you were just in South Africa,

113
00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.040
was staying with my brothers.
And what have you, Andrew

114
00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.250
saw that. I mean, people
just stroll in casually and

115
00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:21.370
they give very little thought
to whether it's convenient or

116
00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:24.400
inconvenient for, for their host.
You know, their goal is

117
00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.140
we're here to see you
and we're happy to be

118
00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.870
with you. And whether we're
coming right at dinner time,

119
00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:30.730
is there trying to eat
a meal? Oh, well, you

120
00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:33.970
know, so that concern for
me was what I'd observed.

121
00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.580
Other Americans around me doing
you call first and you

122
00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:39.580
bring something you don't just
show up. So it was

123
00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:41.350
troublesome to me that we're
going to do this to

124
00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:43.570
your parents where we're going
right at dinner time and

125
00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:46.030
just kind of strolling in
empty handed. You know, my

126
00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:48.640
impression of that is that
it's okay for children. You

127
00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.500
know, if, if, if, if
all boys were to come

128
00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:53.260
over and see us, that's
fine. Then they're little, but

129
00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:57.490
adults working, adults who are
competent and self-sufficient probably should

130
00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:01.180
do something. So it bothered
me that you insist and

131
00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:03.240
let me know. Well, I
wasn't insisting that we not,

132
00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:05.200
it was just like, Oh,
another place to stop to

133
00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.600
get more stuff. So Africans
don't bring stuff every time

134
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.430
they come over, it seems
like they do. No. I

135
00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:11.890
mean, really, honestly, we don't,
we take step one, we're

136
00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:14.230
going to see somebody at
the hospital, obviously, because they're

137
00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:16.870
not able to, you know,
get out there themselves. But

138
00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:18.910
for the most part I'm
and you saw this, people

139
00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:20.800
just showed up. Oh yeah.
Well, we had, we had

140
00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.900
a house of what, six
or seven people. And then

141
00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.030
it would, we would blink
and suddenly a cousin would

142
00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:27.250
come over our second cousin
and then they would bring

143
00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:28.990
their wife and their four
kids. And the next thing

144
00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:31.690
you know, we've got 15
in a house. Exactly. And

145
00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:33.610
just when you know, it
always seems like it's at

146
00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:36.340
an inconvenient time, we're serving
dinner for those that we

147
00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:38.410
knew were going to be
there. And wouldn't, you know,

148
00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:40.630
it right. As people sitting
down to eat in walks

149
00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:42.730
seven other people, and it's
like, Oh crap. You know,

150
00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:46.090
but somehow food's always found
you, you make, do with

151
00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:48.250
whatever little is there. You,
you cut it into, into,

152
00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:50.890
into quarters. If that doesn't
work into AIDS, you know?

153
00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.620
Well, it's interesting because no
one ever actually said, I

154
00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:55.360
mean, we were there a
month and no one said,

155
00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.330
do you mind if we
stay for dinner or is

156
00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:00.580
there enough? You know, I
don't want to impose that

157
00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:03.310
was never said, people just
sat on the couch and

158
00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:07.300
then a plate appeared. Right.
Right. And sometimes the plate

159
00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:09.370
had, you know, a whole
bunch of food and sometimes

160
00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:11.170
the plate had very little
food, but there was always

161
00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:13.710
a plate. And there's always
food. You know? Now when,

162
00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:15.400
when you brought, when you
bring the plate, when people

163
00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:19.180
come over, I noticed that
people, and of course, I've

164
00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:21.610
noticed this for the last
10 years. So I'm speaking

165
00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:23.590
a little bit, like this
is new to me, but

166
00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:27.670
for the purposes of the
interview, someone would bring a

167
00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:31.510
pitcher of water, a towel,
and then a big bowl

168
00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:34.090
and you would wash the
hands of the, of the

169
00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:37.210
guests. And it seemed like
that only happened when new

170
00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:39.220
people had come over. Like,
we didn't do that every

171
00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:41.740
day when we were just
hanging out, but an uncle

172
00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:44.020
would come over and auntie,
and then that would, that

173
00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:48.070
would come out. Yeah. Well,
in part, it also depends

174
00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:50.020
on a, you know, where
the person's been. Right. So

175
00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:51.460
if somebody has been working
in the car and then

176
00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:53.350
don't come in, it's dinner
time. Yeah. You're going to

177
00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:55.710
offer them that, that, you
know, to watch their hands

178
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:57.450
and what have you, the
equivalent, I mean, it happens

179
00:08:57.450 --> 00:08:59.730
all the time, wash up
before dinner type of thing.

180
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:02.850
But it also, depending on
what we're eating, right. If

181
00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:05.350
we're eating what we call
in Zim sides, right side,

182
00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:08.250
the cornmeal, you use your
hands to do that. So

183
00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:10.620
you would definitely offer everybody
their hands, you know, to

184
00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:12.660
have them wash their hands
so that they are clean.

185
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:15.240
Right. Because they're going to
eat, but it's also just

186
00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:17.730
out of respect, you know,
that you'd say, man, wash

187
00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:19.710
your hands. And sometimes they
say, no, you know, my

188
00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:23.300
hands are clean and that's
fine. But you would, there

189
00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:25.610
was a, there was a
pecking order for lack of

190
00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:27.410
a better word, because it
was always one of the

191
00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:30.890
young women in the house
that would do the washing.

192
00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:33.920
Right. It wasn't ever the
home, our host, your brother.

193
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:37.250
It was never me. And
when you would walk around

194
00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:40.190
and bring the water, you
did it. And there's kind

195
00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:44.360
of an unspoken order, right?
Like, let's say, let's say

196
00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:48.710
that it's me, your mom
and an uncle. Who's really

197
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:53.090
old. Probably the uncle would
go first and then your

198
00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:57.230
mom and then me, how
do you figure those things

199
00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:59.240
out? I mean, is that
because I was in my

200
00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:01.340
mind trying to work out
the business rules, you know,

201
00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:03.080
how I was writing the
program to figure it out.

202
00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:05.810
And I was like, Oh,
they picked her first. Oh,

203
00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:08.090
okay. Is that because she's
older because she's a woman

204
00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:11.120
now, how do those things
get figured out? Well, I

205
00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.890
mean, I would still argue
that Africa really is a

206
00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:16.760
male dominated society, you know?
And people don't always agree

207
00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:18.290
with that, but, but I
think so when you see

208
00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:20.630
this and whether it's it's,
you know, the way you

209
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:23.030
watch people's hands, whether it's
the, the, the cuts of

210
00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:25.910
meat, if you've got chicken
that you cooked, right. Who's

211
00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:27.650
going to get the bigger
piece of chicken. What's not

212
00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:29.090
going to be the wife
who did the cooking. It's

213
00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:30.410
not going to be the
kids. It's usually to go

214
00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:33.920
and beat the head of
the household, the mail, the

215
00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:37.160
big piece of chicken. Yep.
Absolutely. Absolutely. You know, that

216
00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:39.620
still happens today. It's it
still does it still does

217
00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:41.270
I still do it? Yeah.
I don't know why you

218
00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:46.640
take the big chicken, As
I said, the brains behind

219
00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:49.670
that Stealing chicken for me
dare with that about Yeah.

220
00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:52.730
But, but you're right, absolutely.
That it is going to

221
00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:54.290
be an age thing. And
then from the age thing,

222
00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:56.810
it's going to be respect.
So in gender though, too,

223
00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:59.720
and gender. Yeah. Right. There
were two old people, wife

224
00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:03.200
and husband. You do the
man first. Yeah. Is that

225
00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:06.170
fine? Just, you know, it's,
it's what I grew up

226
00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:09.830
with. So I never really
questioned it too much. That

227
00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:11.540
just was the way it
was. And as much as

228
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:13.730
the women were the ones
that were doing the cooking

229
00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:15.680
and the cleaning every night,
you, you saw that, you

230
00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:17.030
know, and a couple of
times you tried to come

231
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:19.340
in and help and it
made other women feel very

232
00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:23.480
uncomfortable. That was weird. That's
happened also eight, nine years

233
00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:27.720
ago when we went there
the first time, because my

234
00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:29.810
family, I think it was
like day two in Zimbabwe.

235
00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:31.370
That very, very, very first
trip. And I was like,

236
00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:32.990
all right, dinner's ready. Do
you know, should be dinners

237
00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:36.080
done. Rather let's do the
dishes because this is what

238
00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:39.110
my dad does. You know,
my dad, right. We did

239
00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:41.360
a show with my dad.
He would roll up his

240
00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:43.910
sleeves and let's start doing
the dishes. No ladies, everybody,

241
00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:46.430
ladies sit down, the men
have got this and he'd

242
00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:48.620
make a big, big thing
about the man or doing

243
00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:50.690
the dishes. And we do
it. You guys kicked me

244
00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:52.850
out of the, out of
the kitchen. Well, Hey, you

245
00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:55.510
were in the way bumbling
around. So thank you. Appreciate

246
00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:58.890
that. But, but you're right.
I mean, it it's, it

247
00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:01.090
was very odd. They didn't
know what to do with

248
00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:04.660
you. They, they didn't really
know what your role was

249
00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:06.400
there. And it was kind
of like, what is it

250
00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.620
that he needs? Let's help
him get it, but he

251
00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:11.260
can leave, but kept offering
me drinks. Yeah. It's like,

252
00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:13.230
Oh, you're obviously looking for
something, right, Kitchen. Well, you

253
00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:14.610
know, they ended up setting.
This is the thing that

254
00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:18.750
they ended up sending me
outside to make fire with

255
00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:21.150
the other men. And all
we were doing out there

256
00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:25.140
was arguing about how best
to rearrange the woods, such

257
00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:30.360
to make this BBQ successful
while we're toiling away for

258
00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:32.580
three, four hours. Yeah. Your
guys are mopping the kitchen.

259
00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:34.320
And we're trying to figure
out whether the cardboard goes

260
00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.930
on top or underneath the
wood. It's very high tech.

261
00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:39.060
And yet I would want
to say that, I mean,

262
00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:40.980
men, weren't very hard to,
you know, if, if you

263
00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:43.800
look at my brother and
his wife, I mean, he's

264
00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:45.690
doing a lot of work
himself is, is, are you,

265
00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:48.870
you know? And so is
she, it's, it's a balance.

266
00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.330
It's a different balance. Yeah.
Right. I mean, she, she

267
00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:54.600
would wake up four or
five in the morning, come

268
00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:57.660
out, set up breakfast and
then go back to sleep.

269
00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:00.240
And then for us, as
the people who woke up

270
00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:03.150
at eight, it was a
miracle. Food was, we went

271
00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:04.710
to bed, there was no
food. We woke up, there

272
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:07.890
was food, no one was
seen. And that was what

273
00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:11.880
she did. But at the
same time, your brother, her

274
00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:14.970
husband would, would get up
at 11 or 12 at

275
00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:17.670
night to go and pick
up his brother from work

276
00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:19.290
and then drop him at
his house because he didn't

277
00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:22.350
have a car. So it
was different work, but it

278
00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:25.020
was, it was equal that
they're definitely a house where

279
00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:28.680
they're working equally hard. Yeah.
Everybody's pulling their weight. It's

280
00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:30.750
a different kind of weight
than what you and I

281
00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:33.930
are doing here. Yeah. Yeah.
Did they have any trouble

282
00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:37.500
with, with me coming into
the family at all? Or

283
00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:39.720
was it, I mean, from
the color perspective or was

284
00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.700
it again, just cultural stuff?
Like, this is just a

285
00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:44.010
weird guy, as opposed to,
this is a weird white

286
00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:46.920
guy. Well, I mean, you
know, can we say this

287
00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:48.990
on your show? That's right.
I don't know, what are

288
00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:51.510
we going to say? Right.
Yeah. We can always edit

289
00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:55.860
this. Right? No, the, the,
one of the things that

290
00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:57.540
have no knowledge of young
was we had an uncle,

291
00:13:57.570 --> 00:13:59.550
you know, I don't know
if it was a drunkard

292
00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:02.370
per se, but he considered
himself like a visionary, somebody

293
00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:04.440
who could see into the
future. And he called it,

294
00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:06.510
you know, for me, he
just said, one day I

295
00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:08.730
must've been 11 or 12.
Oh, you're going to marry

296
00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:11.340
somebody, a foreigner, somebody not
from here. You know, we

297
00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:12.690
didn't think it was going
to be a white guy,

298
00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:16.230
but that was always out
there for me. So when

299
00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:18.960
I left and came to
the States, I think that

300
00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:21.510
seated long, been planted, even
though we dismissed it, what

301
00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:23.700
did he know? You know,
he wasn't really much of

302
00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:27.030
anything. That's the Sancho. I
mean, it's not like any

303
00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:29.910
other things that he said
came true, but nevertheless, he

304
00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:31.950
had said it, you know,
he explicitly, while we're having

305
00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:33.900
dinner one day just, It
is really happening. I mean,

306
00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:36.600
as I've heard this story
before and your sister, the

307
00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:40.020
eldest child, your sister actually
gave this speech at our

308
00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:42.600
wedding. And I was like,
ah, this is his story.

309
00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:46.140
No, it is actually, it
didn't happen yet. So were

310
00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:49.020
they surprised when I married
you? Yeah, there was surprised,

311
00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:52.010
but was it a total
shock? No. It, and again,

312
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:53.840
I think the big issue
for them wasn't so much

313
00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:56.180
erased. And as much as
it was, I had long

314
00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:59.000
been saying I was never
going to marry, not just

315
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.400
an American, but a foreigner,
because I always wanted to

316
00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.650
go back home to Zimbabwe.
Cause I always wanted to

317
00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:05.810
go back and be with
my people and help them

318
00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:08.150
out. That's why I was
getting an education. Right. So

319
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:10.490
I could go back home
and make a difference. And

320
00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:12.410
all of a sudden here
I am saying, I'm getting

321
00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:14.630
married to you. And it's
like, well, what do you

322
00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:16.640
do with that? All that
feeling that you've had in

323
00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:18.740
the past about, I want
to go back home on

324
00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:21.620
and go back home, you
know, because I'd always wanted

325
00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:24.560
to avoid making somebody choose
between me and my people

326
00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:27.410
in my home and you
know, you and your people

327
00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:29.510
in your home. So that
was, it was a difficult

328
00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:32.720
choice. I had expressed it
as being a very difficult

329
00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:34.640
choice and one that I
wasn't willing to make to

330
00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:37.310
have anybody make on my
behalf. So they were surprised.

331
00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:39.760
I mean, they were, they
were stunned. Yeah. And I

332
00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:43.210
remember that you were concerned
even when we were getting

333
00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:48.010
married, that you would have
to sneak assistance to the

334
00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:49.780
family. I mean, you would
kind of confided in me

335
00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:51.340
after the fact, once we
found that, that it was

336
00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:52.840
going to be a non
issue that you were concerned,

337
00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:55.120
well, all right, I'm married,
I've made this decision. I

338
00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:57.040
married this guy, but I'm
still going to have to

339
00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:59.440
sneak my own money to
the family to help them

340
00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:03.010
because he's going to lose
patients quickly. Yeah. I mean,

341
00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:04.780
it's, it's a hard, it's
a hard thing. You know,

342
00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:07.120
when you're one of seven,
I was raised with a

343
00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:09.640
very clear expectation that we
take care of ourselves and

344
00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:12.070
we take care of each
other. And I didn't really

345
00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:14.740
think that that was something
that a lot of Americans

346
00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:17.470
were familiar with. I mean,
no disrespect to, you know,

347
00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:21.610
to your listeners, but it
is such a burden is

348
00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:23.110
the wrong word for it.
But it is maybe an

349
00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:25.930
obligation. It is this thing
that you're raised with this

350
00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:28.060
idea that take care of
yourself and take care of

351
00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:30.760
your siblings and your parents.
You say something about wound

352
00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:34.180
too, as a concept. Yeah.
I mean, one, two is

353
00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:36.910
exactly that the, the, the,
the, the way of being,

354
00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:40.670
I guess, I really, I
failed to find English people

355
00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:43.540
through other people. Yeah. But
you are no one without

356
00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:46.450
your other people. Right. Right.
I mean, that's a song

357
00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:52.210
that you're referencing, <inaudible> South
African singer, but absolutely. <inaudible>,

358
00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:54.100
that's pretty much the same
thing. You know, you, you

359
00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:56.560
are who you are because
of other people. So in

360
00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:59.800
their absence, you are nothing
type of thing. And so

361
00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:02.380
I didn't think that would
be something that my American

362
00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:05.800
husband would understand. I just
didn't think it was a

363
00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:08.470
concept that you are going
to be familiar with, but

364
00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:10.450
it wasn't something that I
was willing to give up.

365
00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:12.400
So in my mind, it
was like, well, I'm a

366
00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:15.460
working individual, you know, I'm
bringing in money, I'll find

367
00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:18.580
a way to get the
necessary funds to my family.

368
00:17:18.610 --> 00:17:21.430
And of course, thankfully it
was a nonissue because of

369
00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:23.200
how you were raised, as
it turned out that, you

370
00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:25.330
know, you do have similar
values, et cetera, et cetera.

371
00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:27.340
But I didn't expect that.
I mean, before we got

372
00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:30.400
married, I really, I really
didn't expect that understanding because

373
00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:32.650
it is, it is a
hard, it's not a, it's

374
00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:35.320
not a short thing, you
know, it's, it goes on

375
00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:38.110
in perpetuity or yeah. Not
just the life commitment to

376
00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:40.880
you, but it's a life
commitment to, to the other,

377
00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:44.620
the other seven people and
exactly India kids and their

378
00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:47.560
kids and their kids. So
it's, it's ongoing and it's

379
00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:49.320
it's work. And it's not
just, I mean, to be

380
00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:52.380
clear, it's not necessarily Monetary,
but it's to make sure

381
00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:54.870
that you're calling everyone and
checking in and making sure

382
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:58.710
that everyone's okay. It's not
about writing checks and throwing

383
00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:01.130
money over the wall. It's
bad. It's, it's, it's emotional

384
00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:04.130
support. It's spiritual support. It's,
you know, if they need

385
00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:07.010
you, are you there type
of thing. Do you know

386
00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:09.770
how to make the possible
out of the impossible? Well,

387
00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:12.440
the dotnet ninjas at Telerik
do they just released a

388
00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:14.780
huge pack of web controls,
all built on top of

389
00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:18.560
ESPN at Ajax, that'll help
you build impossibly fast and

390
00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:21.680
interactive applications in no time
at all. They've made the

391
00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:25.760
impossible possible in desktop development.
If you think you can't

392
00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:28.400
have a carousel component and
wind forms, well, you can,

393
00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:31.700
their windows forms, suite features
a super powerful grid view

394
00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:34.460
control on 32 other crazy
desktop components that will give

395
00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:38.420
you a dazzling WPF like
features, but in wind farms,

396
00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:40.940
they do the same thing
in reporting solutions with a

397
00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:43.460
new design surface, like nothing
else looks just like graph

398
00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:47.780
paper gives you advanced page
layout capabilities makes it feel

399
00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:50.300
more like a graphic design
software than a reporting solution.

400
00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:56.300
Go check them out@telerikdotcomandbeat.net Ninja.
Thanks for listening. And one

401
00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:59.570
of the things that I'm
consistently having trouble with when

402
00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:03.230
I am overseas or interacting
with your family is this

403
00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:07.400
idea of, of honesty versus
diplomacy. And one of the

404
00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:10.490
people on our blog on
the blog, one of the

405
00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:13.100
commenters on the blog said
that this is the difference

406
00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:17.240
between me having IQ and
you having EEQ or another

407
00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:19.700
way to phrase it is
that I'm a socially backward

408
00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:21.440
programmer who doesn't know my
ass from a hole in

409
00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:24.920
the ground. And you are
a, you know, a subtle

410
00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:29.450
and thoughtful member of society.
Has that idea of being,

411
00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:34.220
being straight with people versus
being, being diplomatic while still

412
00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:38.180
getting the message across and
an issue for us. Yeah.

413
00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:39.800
I think it has been
an issue for us at

414
00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:41.060
that. You're going to ask
if it's been an issue

415
00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:44.300
just for me in general,
it has been, I mean,

416
00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:45.920
I remember when I first
came to the States, I

417
00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:48.950
found people who very, very
abrupt, you know, people would

418
00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:51.710
just say, Hey, can you
do X, Y, Z for

419
00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:54.080
me? And I think, good
grief. You just don't care

420
00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:56.050
about me at all. Do
you? There's no. Hello, how

421
00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:59.960
you doing? You know, how's
the day treating you? None

422
00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.870
of that. There was just
always exactly no plan. And

423
00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:04.820
I found a very abrupt,
you know, so I did

424
00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:06.290
have a bit of trouble
with that. And I think

425
00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:07.670
you and I have gone
back and forth on this

426
00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:10.430
issue of, you know, you
want something, but care a

427
00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:13.310
little bit about me, the
person you're talking to enough

428
00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:16.640
to value my wellbeing before
you value, whatever it is

429
00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:18.980
that you want from me.
You know? So it's, it's

430
00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:21.440
been difficult. But what I
found very interesting is as

431
00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:23.000
we've been married and over
the years, as I've gone

432
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.270
back, people say that I
am just as abrupt now,

433
00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:29.780
as they would find you,
which I'm shocked, I'm stunned,

434
00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:32.120
how's that possible. You know,
And that gets back to

435
00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:34.850
the idea that you're half
here and half there. And

436
00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:38.690
you don't. I always feel
like when we go there

437
00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:40.850
and we try to go
to Africa every year or

438
00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:47.590
two, that you reassert your
Africanness, you with all due

439
00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:51.550
respect there, you tend your
accent switches back. You start

440
00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:56.020
to hit words differently. You
start to kind of move

441
00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:58.870
the needle in the other
direction a little bit, and

442
00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:02.590
the extra African do you
consciously do, do you have

443
00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:05.020
any conscious understanding of, of,
of maybe doing that of

444
00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:08.140
reasserting arena, putting, basically putting
your stamping your foot in

445
00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:09.940
the ground and just kind
of pushing a little harder

446
00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:11.590
to make sure that you
remember where you came from?

447
00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:15.090
You know, I, I don't,
you're not the only person

448
00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:17.040
that has pointed that out.
I remember that a couple

449
00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:18.690
of our cousins just a
couple of weeks ago were

450
00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:21.780
saying the same thing. It's
not a conscious thing that

451
00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:24.120
I do, obviously I do
it cause even they heard

452
00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:26.610
it, they're saying, well, you
know, I'm not the only

453
00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:28.170
one. Cause you've told me
for years that I was

454
00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:30.720
insane. And this was just
me. I actually remember, you

455
00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:33.930
know, being, being, being an
engineer, you actually recorded it

456
00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:35.460
at one point in time.
And when you played it

457
00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:37.770
back to me, I could
hear it. But in the

458
00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:40.140
moment, no. Okay. Right. Well,
that's the accent. I mean,

459
00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:43.140
the accent thing is easily,
is easily proven. You know,

460
00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:47.250
when you're talking in your
language, which is really kind

461
00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:50.250
of like, I don't know,
it's kind of like Spanglish

462
00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:51.870
in the sense of it's
half end of Ellie and

463
00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:54.810
half English, because you use,
you use a lot of

464
00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:57.000
borrowed words, your languages, there's
a lot of foreign words.

465
00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:01.590
Those borrowed words are said
explicitly in, in the underbelly

466
00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:05.790
accent, but I'm thinking more
of the, you know, personality

467
00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:08.610
stuff, you know, you're even
more deferential to elders when

468
00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:10.350
you're there. I mean, you
really are. When in Rome

469
00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:14.040
do as the do, as
the Romans do, But to

470
00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:16.560
be clear, I mean, I
think it's the amplification of

471
00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:18.960
who I am is what
you're getting at there because

472
00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:21.870
I do believe, and in,
in being differential to elders,

473
00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:24.690
even here, when, when I'm
away from that, you know,

474
00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:28.110
but, but yeah, it probably
is just a desire to

475
00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:30.420
just blend in and not
be, you know, what's been

476
00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:33.330
interesting about our lives from
a race point of view

477
00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:35.910
is that when we're in
the States, I'm typically the

478
00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:38.640
one that stands out because
Oregon has so few black

479
00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:41.220
people, for instance. But when
we get to whether it's

480
00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:44.100
symbolic, where South Africa, you know,
like we're just in introvert,

481
00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:46.890
you know, went to the
mall and you were one

482
00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:48.840
of them, We didn't just
go to them all. We

483
00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:52.290
went to the Soweto mall
Ponya mall, which is not

484
00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:55.260
just the black mall, but
it's like know black mall

485
00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:58.110
in Soweto. Yeah. There was
me and one other guy

486
00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:01.620
And he didn't show up.
He didn't have, we didn't

487
00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:03.960
even see him for awhile.
So it was very interesting

488
00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:06.030
to me to have you
be the one now that's

489
00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:08.460
sort of anything that you
do. You've got, you know,

490
00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:10.860
15, 20, 30 pairs of
eyes that are pretending not

491
00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:12.660
to be watching you, but
they're watching you, you know,

492
00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:14.040
you've got a lot of
people that are listening to

493
00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:16.050
you, but pretending to be,
you know, nonchalant, you're doing

494
00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:19.530
something else or whatever. And
so that I think is,

495
00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:21.150
is where race comes in.
But coming back to the

496
00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:24.720
issue of, of, of honesty
versus diplomacy, I mean, I

497
00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:27.570
think, I think you tend
to, to hit it hard,

498
00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:29.880
you know, you're very, very
honest you as an individual.

499
00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:32.040
And I think maybe a
lot of Americans is the

500
00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:35.120
people on Insta to, and
I'm generalizing here. So they

501
00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:38.340
understood, you know, whereas, you
know, I was raised with

502
00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:41.520
this idea that even if
I have to listen to

503
00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:45.000
my grandmother, say something that
I know is absolutely wrong,

504
00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:48.380
what, what, what does it
hurt me to let her

505
00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:50.270
think she's right. Right. You
know, at the end of

506
00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:52.400
the day, when all is
said and done, you know,

507
00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:54.350
I can, in my head
know that I was right,

508
00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:56.810
but give her this one
small thing. Right. And, and

509
00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:58.700
so I learned to just
let a lot of stuff

510
00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:02.090
go good, bad or indifferent.
It's it's, you know, certainly

511
00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:05.750
I wouldn't stand there and
let her, you know, perjure

512
00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:09.880
herself with something People, a
lot of you give them

513
00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:12.250
a lot of time. And
this is, I think one

514
00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:14.740
of the problems with not
just American women, again, Americans,

515
00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:17.350
again, we continue to generalize,
but, but people are time

516
00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:22.060
obsessed and I'm, I am
certainly time obsessed. So when

517
00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:24.790
every time we go to
Africa and we get more

518
00:24:24.790 --> 00:24:26.410
than five or 10 people
in the room, there's some

519
00:24:26.410 --> 00:24:29.950
kind of a crisis might
be a little crisis. We

520
00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:32.230
had a crisis where we
wanted to buy a refrigerator.

521
00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:35.980
Right. And when I say
crisis, I mean, tiny lowercase

522
00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:38.620
C, it was a very
simple, right. Let's buy a

523
00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:43.450
fridge. You know, we got
some young, our brothers are

524
00:24:44.890 --> 00:24:47.950
starting their life. They need
a fridge. From my point

525
00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:51.730
of view, I, I wanted
to attack it. Like, all

526
00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:56.890
right, what are the candidate
fridges? What are our candidates

527
00:24:56.890 --> 00:24:59.260
ridges? I was ready to
do the whole consumer reports

528
00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:02.140
right up on the fridge.
Well, I felt that you

529
00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:04.030
guys were just going on
and on and on and

530
00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:09.460
on and on about unrelated
on fridge related things, unrefrigerated

531
00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:12.550
related things. And it made
me realize that there's this

532
00:25:12.550 --> 00:25:14.950
thing that you've always told
me, cry with the crying.

533
00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:18.580
And you want to say
something about what that means

534
00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:21.310
cry with the crying. Well,
I mean, it's just basically

535
00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:24.840
empathize really is along the
shorter fit. You know, I,

536
00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:27.340
I think talking about your
personally, you tend to come

537
00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:30.100
in and be very efficient,
right? And you want to

538
00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:32.260
get the job done. If
you come in and you

539
00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:34.650
find people, you know, sort
of lamenting that, Oh, a

540
00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:36.970
hungry, you know, the fridge,
what are we going to

541
00:25:36.970 --> 00:25:38.950
do? Where do we go?
Exactly. You know, whether it's

542
00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:41.080
hunger, whether it's a fridge,
whether it's a call, whatever,

543
00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:43.360
you know, you just sort
of want to identify the

544
00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:45.960
problem, you know, and attack
it and just handle it.

545
00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.490
Right. I found in Africa,
that's saying, all right, everyone,

546
00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:52.150
what is the very next
action? Not the best way

547
00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:55.960
to attack a problem in
South Africa, at least in my

548
00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:59.190
experience. And, and speaking for
specifically, just for my family.

549
00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:01.930
Okay. Let's, let's go specifically
to end of LA culture,

550
00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:05.470
black South Africa, your family. Yeah.
Yes. This is very likely.

551
00:26:05.650 --> 00:26:08.170
I'm sure that there are
families. Yeah. That, that maybe

552
00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:10.480
attack things this way. I
don't know. Maybe, maybe not,

553
00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:15.190
but definitely not my finest
hour. Right. Right. I mean,

554
00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:17.350
when you do that, then
you're coming in, you've taken

555
00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:20.620
away. The people, you know,
that were mid discussion, your

556
00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:23.170
finance in the middle of
a conversation and you just

557
00:26:23.170 --> 00:26:25.660
stop everything and just kind
of like, Oh, I am

558
00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:27.790
here. I have seen the
light. And let me show

559
00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:30.070
you, you know, and you
don't mean it that way,

560
00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:32.680
but it just has this
very it's cold water. You

561
00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:35.410
know, it just stops the
discussion and leaves everybody feeling

562
00:26:35.410 --> 00:26:37.930
very confused. And what ends
up happening then is that

563
00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:40.390
people defer to you, you
know? And so at the

564
00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:41.920
end of it all, you
know, when you then come

565
00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:43.890
to me, cause I'm the
loud one, you're the loud

566
00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:45.180
one. And you're the one
that's come in and sort

567
00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:48.150
of asserted yourself aggressively and
said, let's get this job

568
00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:50.850
done my way. And then
afterwards, when you ask them

569
00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:52.920
and say, so, are you
happy with the fridge then

570
00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:56.220
the pushback as well you
are. And then you're taken

571
00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:58.470
aback. You're stunned. It's like,
what do you mean I

572
00:26:58.470 --> 00:27:01.380
am well, sure. We did
it your way. So as

573
00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:03.660
long as you are happy
with the fridge, what do

574
00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:06.110
you need from me? You
know? So let's take that

575
00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:08.510
concept and then let's flip
it on its year. After

576
00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:11.960
you graduated with your MBA,
you went to work and

577
00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:14.030
you went to work with
a very diverse crowd of

578
00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:17.210
different ages and different colors
and different levels of experience.

579
00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:19.430
And when it came to
sitting in a room and

580
00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:23.870
solving a problem, not necessarily
getting a fridge, but procuring

581
00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:26.690
something else or working through
an issue at one of

582
00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:29.870
the nonprofits that you worked
at, how did your technique

583
00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:33.530
and your style and your
Africanness work within the context

584
00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:36.800
of a room full of
Americans? That was difficult. I

585
00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:39.290
mean, I had to, there
was definitely a learning curve

586
00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:41.780
for me, right. When I'm
in the office or if

587
00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:45.110
I'm taking call from a,
a client, for instance. Yeah.

588
00:27:45.170 --> 00:27:47.480
They may or may not
be interested in, in my

589
00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:50.360
five minute, 10 minute warmup
before I get to the

590
00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:52.700
real problem. There were people
that legitimately didn't have a

591
00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:55.340
lot of time. They needed
things handled and handled quickly.

592
00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:58.910
So it took a while,
but I guess I've always

593
00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:01.910
seen a difference between a
professional setting and a social

594
00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:04.340
setting. You know, I've always
made that distinction. Yeah. Whether

595
00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:06.980
it be in Africa or
in America. Right, Right, right.

596
00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:09.380
I mean, even, even in,
in Zim, you know, people

597
00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:11.540
get things done even in
Zim. So I don't want

598
00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:13.250
to imply that, you know,
it's always a bunch of

599
00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:16.000
incompetent people that just, you
know, everybody's sitting around and

600
00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:17.990
just kind of saying, eh,
you know, don't worry about

601
00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:21.410
the time. Well, like when
I blogged about African time,

602
00:28:22.330 --> 00:28:24.410
a very large number of
people who've been to Africa

603
00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:29.450
immediately related, but a lot
of people felt a little

604
00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:32.570
offended, a little insulted that
I was saying, Oh, well,

605
00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:35.360
you're saying Africans are lazy
and late. And, and, and

606
00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:37.130
know what I was trying
to say. And apparently I

607
00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:39.890
failed was that Africans have
a much more fluid perception

608
00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:42.290
of time, but that doesn't
necessarily mean that a business

609
00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:44.660
meeting is going to be
running three, four hours late.

610
00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:47.570
That's fine. That's right. It
all depends on what the

611
00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:49.820
situation is. You know, I
talked about going to visit

612
00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:53.000
people in the hospital. For
instance, we may leave the

613
00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.120
house and say, okay, we're
going to visit uncle Michael,

614
00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:57.980
whoever for, for 20 minutes
when we get there, if

615
00:28:57.980 --> 00:28:59.570
we find that, you know,
he really is in a

616
00:28:59.570 --> 00:29:01.940
bad state, for instance, I'll
be more inclined to spend

617
00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:04.010
a couple of hours with
him, you know, or if

618
00:29:04.010 --> 00:29:05.660
we're just having a good
time or whatever the case

619
00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:08.090
may be. Whereas I would
suggest that you probably would

620
00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:09.860
still sort of say, Hey,
we came in here saying,

621
00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:11.030
we're going to, you know,
we're going to give it

622
00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:13.190
20 minutes or 20 minutes
out. Let's go, let's do

623
00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:15.910
this. You know? So it's,
I mean, it's, it's probably,

624
00:29:16.030 --> 00:29:18.380
yeah. I see. I hear
examples like that are always

625
00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:20.330
unfair. But I think the
point is is that if

626
00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:22.910
someone in Zimbabwe were trying
to close on their mortgage,

627
00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:25.340
they're going to show up
on time at the mortgage

628
00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:28.460
broker for the thing. But
if there's a dinner afterwards

629
00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:30.650
for five o'clock, they may
roll in at eight 30.

630
00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:33.740
Right. Depending on who's hosting
the dinner, if it's, you

631
00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:37.130
know, again, what the expectations
are. Yeah. First of all,

632
00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:39.770
I mean, just you don't
disrespect really. That's that's the

633
00:29:39.770 --> 00:29:41.890
way I was raised. So
if mom were waiting for

634
00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:44.650
me somewhere, I would be
less inclined to keep her

635
00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:46.420
waiting for instance, than I
would a friend of mine,

636
00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:47.830
because then I would say,
Oh, you know, I was

637
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:50.490
doing this, that, and the
other thing, and Yeah, and

638
00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:53.550
this goes both ways. People
are equally forgiving based on

639
00:29:53.550 --> 00:29:56.310
context. Right. And, and you
saw with my brothers, for

640
00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:58.560
instance, you know, that, that
leave or I'd go with

641
00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:00.060
them and you'd go with
them and they'd say, I'll

642
00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:01.800
be back in an hour.
And then four hours later,

643
00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:04.050
they stroll back in no
apology. Well, you know, I

644
00:30:04.050 --> 00:30:06.720
was, I have a lot
of trouble with that because

645
00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:11.280
I always, maybe over empathize
about the other person's time.

646
00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:13.770
We went to pick up
one of our cousins and

647
00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:15.900
he was in downtown Joburg
and we were supposed to

648
00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:18.000
pick him up at 11.
I think he got picked

649
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.480
up around three and I
thought he was being artificially

650
00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:23.700
gracious because he was saying,
no, no, no, it was

651
00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:26.370
fine. You know, we just
hung around, but this was

652
00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:29.700
on, he was totally fine.
He took the opportunity of

653
00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:33.600
our lateness to show his
wife around downtown. And they

654
00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:36.510
spent a very leisurely and
relaxed four hours, which I

655
00:30:36.510 --> 00:30:38.970
can't even conceive of a
leisurely. And for the next

656
00:30:38.970 --> 00:30:41.580
four hours of waiting for
a ride to, to see

657
00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:45.420
the sites, right. So it's
not just about lateness or

658
00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:47.610
waiting for someone to emulate,
but it's also taking advantage

659
00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:50.130
of the time to do,
to do other things, which

660
00:30:50.130 --> 00:30:52.680
is consistently difficult for me
to get my brain around.

661
00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:55.410
I think it's all about,
you know, how you take

662
00:30:55.410 --> 00:30:59.040
it, right? If you understand
that they mean no disrespect

663
00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:01.560
to me by not being
here, then you're more likely

664
00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:03.990
to, to, to roll with
it and let it go.

665
00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:06.300
If you assume that, Oh,
most that she was going

666
00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:08.970
to be here at 11
it's 11, 10. She's still

667
00:31:08.970 --> 00:31:10.770
not here. That means she
thinks my 10 minutes are

668
00:31:10.790 --> 00:31:13.500
not worth much of anything.
That's a very different statement

669
00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:15.870
of what she thinks. That's
right. That's right. But if

670
00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:17.550
you say to me, Oh,
Scott said he was going

671
00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:20.040
to pick me up at
11 it's now noon. I

672
00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:22.590
know that in that hour,
whatever he was doing was

673
00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:26.100
really very compelling, so much
so that he thought it

674
00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:29.010
best that he take care
of that issue. Then come

675
00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:31.110
here and get me. Then
when you come, I can

676
00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:33.390
say, so what was going
on? And you'll probably tell

677
00:31:33.390 --> 00:31:34.980
me, you know, I had
a flat tire or they

678
00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:37.860
take care of the babies
or whatever. There's usually something,

679
00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:41.580
you know, in that instance
that, that our cousin was

680
00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:43.350
waiting for us. You know,
my brother was supposed to

681
00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:46.110
pick them up. I think
it was somewhere helping somebody

682
00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:47.850
else take care of and
really big. He had a

683
00:31:47.850 --> 00:31:51.300
legitimate reason, legitimate thing. It's,
it's never their assumptions. Never

684
00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:53.520
that you're dissing me and
you're disrespecting me. And you

685
00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:56.460
think, you know, I'm not
worth anything to you. So

686
00:31:56.520 --> 00:32:00.060
I think it's all about
perception. Yeah. Well, the culture

687
00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:03.930
gap is consistently a challenge,
a challenge for us. I

688
00:32:03.930 --> 00:32:08.100
mean, time, time is one
thing interacting with my parents

689
00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:11.040
versus your parents. I know
that there was a, there's

690
00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:12.780
a technique. I don't know
if it's a technicality, there's

691
00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:15.240
a rule that I'm not
supposed to. If I understand

692
00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:17.640
correctly, be in the same
room as your mom alone,

693
00:32:17.670 --> 00:32:21.030
or I'm not supposed to
eat. Yeah. It's not, it's

694
00:32:21.030 --> 00:32:22.200
not that you're not supposed
to be in the same

695
00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:25.290
room with her. And this
is really old school. My

696
00:32:25.290 --> 00:32:27.780
parents were not like that
even before my dad passed

697
00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:30.390
away. Yeah. And so they've
let go of a lot

698
00:32:30.390 --> 00:32:33.510
of stuff in there. I'm
fairly educated. So they don't

699
00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:35.730
hold onto a lot of
the traditions as much as

700
00:32:35.730 --> 00:32:39.150
some people might, but right.
The idea is that eating

701
00:32:39.330 --> 00:32:41.720
is in delicate. So that
is something that should be

702
00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:44.990
done separate from the son
in law slash the mother-in-law.

703
00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:47.390
So if my mom is
eating, you should, you should

704
00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:49.940
show your respect to her
by letting her eat freely

705
00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:51.710
by not being in that
room, that type of thing.

706
00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:54.410
So you let her eat
freely, you know, in as

707
00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:56.240
much as it should take
a bathroom since you wouldn't

708
00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:58.100
be in the same room,
obviously and on and on.

709
00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:00.430
So it's okay. So, I
mean, it's obvious to me

710
00:33:00.430 --> 00:33:01.870
in my culture that I
would not be in the

711
00:33:01.870 --> 00:33:03.910
bathroom while your mom's taking
a bath. Right. Same kind

712
00:33:03.910 --> 00:33:07.090
of an idea while she
is eating and smacking her

713
00:33:07.090 --> 00:33:09.730
lips and doing all that
eating stuff. Right. And I

714
00:33:09.730 --> 00:33:11.620
remember early, early on, we
had a little con there

715
00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:14.140
was a little debate, many,
many tiny debate about, are

716
00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:16.000
we going to follow these
rules? What exactly are we

717
00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.120
going to do? And they
immediately, my parents immediately just

718
00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:21.250
blew them off and said,
he can't possibly know about

719
00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:23.320
these things. So, you know,
a lot of it was

720
00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:25.540
just sort of waved. I
mean, even the, the bright

721
00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:26.950
gift, I think you kind
of had to push to

722
00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:28.960
do it because they just
said, this is not, he's

723
00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:31.030
not One of us. One
of the Brian gift was

724
00:33:31.030 --> 00:33:35.110
an interesting, an interesting thing,
because I knew that the

725
00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:36.880
impression that I got from
your mom and dad was

726
00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:39.520
that it would have been
appreciated. It was appreciated when

727
00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:42.940
we did go through with
it. But I could tell

728
00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:44.440
that they were hedging it
in the sense of, they

729
00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:46.300
were saying, well, you know,
if this white American doesn't

730
00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:49.540
want to go through our
process, let's let, let's get

731
00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:52.120
him. Let's, you know, let
them off the hook. But

732
00:33:52.210 --> 00:33:54.700
I had a sense that
if we didn't go through

733
00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:56.560
with it, it would be
one of those little back

734
00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:59.710
of the mind things 10,
20 years later, that would

735
00:33:59.770 --> 00:34:03.910
be remembered, not necessarily with
negativity, but not with fondness.

736
00:34:04.090 --> 00:34:06.010
They're not going to go,
Oh, we're fond of the

737
00:34:06.010 --> 00:34:07.960
fact that he didn't go
through the process. So there

738
00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:09.520
were, I mean, maybe speak
a little bit about the

739
00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:11.280
pride gift. Cause I remember
we had to get a

740
00:34:11.290 --> 00:34:15.670
blanket for your mom to
keep her warm. This was,

741
00:34:15.670 --> 00:34:19.720
this is called Lobola <inaudible>
so yeah, I mean, Lola

742
00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:23.980
basically is, is the, it's
your way of thanking my

743
00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:26.230
family for taking such good
care of me and raising

744
00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:29.740
me and, and all that
good stuff. And it is

745
00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:32.350
in its purest form. It
really is just a way

746
00:34:32.350 --> 00:34:36.970
of expressing appreciation. Obviously with
a hard economic times, it's

747
00:34:36.970 --> 00:34:38.980
become corrupt. A lot of
people use it as a,

748
00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:40.690
as a way to get
money and get rich kind

749
00:34:40.690 --> 00:34:43.630
of quicker than, than they
would otherwise. That is not

750
00:34:43.660 --> 00:34:45.880
what the original intent was.
It really was just a

751
00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:48.670
way of saying, I acknowledged
that, you know, you raise

752
00:34:48.670 --> 00:34:50.890
this wonderful woman and I
thank you for it. And

753
00:34:50.890 --> 00:34:53.230
to be clear, this is
not a dowery in the

754
00:34:53.230 --> 00:34:56.100
sense of the husband to
be received money from the

755
00:34:56.680 --> 00:34:59.230
bride's parents. But rather this
is a bright gift in

756
00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:02.050
that the young man who
is marrying the woman is

757
00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:07.690
presenting gifts, cows and blankets
to the parents of a

758
00:35:07.810 --> 00:35:09.760
prospective project B. So it's
a little bit reversed from

759
00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:11.980
what you would think of
as a traditional dowery. It's

760
00:35:12.010 --> 00:35:14.230
not a dowry. Right. And
I guess it depends on

761
00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:18.160
your perspective. I grew up
with it being the man

762
00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:20.800
does the giving. So for
me, it's you never have

763
00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:22.330
to explain to me that
it's not a diary. You

764
00:35:22.330 --> 00:35:23.770
know what I mean? This
is for the purposes for

765
00:35:23.770 --> 00:35:27.190
the listeners. Right, right, Right.
But yeah. And, and you're

766
00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:29.140
right. It used to be
called and it still is

767
00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:32.170
called a kiss, the bride
price, really. But I don't

768
00:35:32.170 --> 00:35:34.540
like that term because it
sort of says you're buying

769
00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:37.530
something. As I said, in
its purest form, it really

770
00:35:37.530 --> 00:35:41.250
is a way of expressing
appreciation and gratitude to your

771
00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:44.630
future wife's family for taking
care of her. Is it

772
00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:48.260
also set up as a,
a place for the bride

773
00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:50.420
to fall back on? If
the relationship doesn't work out,

774
00:35:50.450 --> 00:35:52.130
she can go back to
her parents and they're not

775
00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:56.270
destitute, You know, I don't
know. I have to agree.

776
00:35:56.470 --> 00:36:00.920
I don't know. I wouldn't
have said so, but it's,

777
00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:04.010
it's entirely possible. I always
thought that it was just

778
00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:06.890
as I said, that, that,
that expression of appreciation, but

779
00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:09.980
there tends to be difficult.
You know? I mean, I

780
00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:13.070
can't my parents, obviously, because
you weren't as involved in

781
00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:14.750
and we had no way
of getting calls for you.

782
00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:17.240
They, We just went with
cash because I couldn't find

783
00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:19.100
cows, but we take it
the blanket, the, each Ollie

784
00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:22.070
That's right. And, and we
did have, We did have

785
00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:24.680
a goat and went through
that whole process, but I

786
00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:27.350
gave the monetary equivalent of
a number of cows while

787
00:36:27.350 --> 00:36:30.920
your brother who is marrying
a woman from Swazi land

788
00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:33.290
is going through a much
more formal process with actual

789
00:36:33.290 --> 00:36:37.970
cow procurement. Right. Which is
quite a challenge because, you

790
00:36:37.970 --> 00:36:40.340
know, he's a, he's a
guy, he's a city guy.

791
00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:43.580
Right. You know, he's a
businessman and he's got to

792
00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:46.400
go and find uncles and
people who are going to

793
00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:48.950
represent him and help him
to find these cows. Right.

794
00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:51.290
And an ongoing process. And
it is a process. I

795
00:36:51.290 --> 00:36:53.150
mean, it really is a
journey because, you know, you

796
00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:55.280
could go a couple, two,
three times and be sent

797
00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:57.910
back, you know, just as
a way of testing or

798
00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:01.070
your determination and how, you
know, your endurance, how committed

799
00:37:01.070 --> 00:37:03.800
is this guy to our
daughter, you know? And so

800
00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:05.420
the first time you show
up, they may say, we

801
00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:06.680
don't want to talk to
you, go away, go away.

802
00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:08.030
And then they chase it
out of the house, you

803
00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:10.150
know? And then you come
back again and then they

804
00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:11.750
didn't chase it out of
the house again. And then

805
00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:13.640
maybe the third time they'll
listen to you and welcome

806
00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:15.800
you in and that type
of thing. So it's, it

807
00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:19.070
is not, the process is
long and it is, but

808
00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:21.170
again, everybody does it as
a, as a sign of

809
00:37:21.170 --> 00:37:24.080
respect. Well, it's definitely been
a challenge with one foot

810
00:37:24.110 --> 00:37:27.500
in Africa and one foot
in America. Thank you, small

811
00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:30.860
wife for talking to me
today on this special edition

812
00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:34.820
of Hanselman. And we will
see you again next week.

813
00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:36.110
Take care.
