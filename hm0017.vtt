00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:58.290
this episode, Scott discusses, RSS
and syndication. Hi, this is

9
00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.170
Carl Franklin. You're listening to Hansel
minutes and I'm here with

10
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.080
Scott again. And this week
we're talking RSS, right? Scott,

11
00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.210
Really simple syndication. Yeah. And
we're talking to Adam and,

12
00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.100
and feeds and, and all
of this chaos, that's going

13
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.670
on around syndication of information
using XML and, and you're

14
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.310
at a hotel room. You're
in Pittsburgh. What I am

15
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.530
in beautiful downtown Pittsburgh, and
I'm in a hotel and

16
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.410
it's 11 o'clock at night
and I've just finished up

17
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.680
doing my Annetta talk at
the local Pittsburgh done at

18
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.920
user's group. I got North
Dallas tomorrow and I've got

19
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.490
Dallas on Thursday and I
should be back in town.

20
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.550
And on Friday, it's crazy.
I don't know what I

21
00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.640
was thinking. I don't know
Either, but at least I'm,

22
00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.750
I'm glad that you got
to squeeze in this show.

23
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.540
So let's jump right in.
What'd you got for us?

24
00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.080
Well, so I've been going
back and forth with the

25
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.500
RSS team at Microsoft. This
is the guys that have

26
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.930
got a whole series of
RSS APIs underneath <inaudible> and

27
00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.350
everyone talks about <inaudible> from
the browser perspective, but there

28
00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.960
is a whole RSS subsystem
that's underneath <inaudible> and Invista

29
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:11.000
that makes this a makes
RSS first-class on windows and

30
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.330
the RSS team's blogs@theshrinkstir.com EVR.
And there's a number of

31
00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.220
things to look at on
their blog. They've got a

32
00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.960
section on the RSS team
blog about this, this underlying

33
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.710
sub system. And what they've
got going is pretty interesting.

34
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.560
They're calling him a bronze,
silver and gold. This is

35
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.020
the windows RSS platform, Allah
cart. So basically an existing

36
00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.530
application, like a feed demon
or an RSS band, you

37
00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.090
know, does all the work,
right? They go out and

38
00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.170
they download the RSS. They
download syndicated content using RSS

39
00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.200
or Adam as their they're
a description of what they're

40
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.840
need to go get. And
they have their own feed

41
00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.390
store. Right. They're actually storing
that information themselves. Okay. Well,

42
00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.640
in, in windows after you
install, <inaudible>, there's a thing

43
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.760
called the common feed list,
right? So this is something

44
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.250
that, that windows knows just
like, you know how, when

45
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.100
you very first install windows,
they say, associate your account

46
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.430
with the.net username. So we
can log you into windows

47
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.730
messenger. You know, it's, it's
that level of, of integration

48
00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.130
system level, Right? So Ron's
level, the RSS team is

49
00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.620
calling is the integration with
that common feed list. That's

50
00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.890
a feed demon on RSS
bandit, making the decision to

51
00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.400
allow people to look at
that common list of feeds

52
00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.090
as well as looking at
whatever feeds they choose, as

53
00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.370
well as, you know, an
importing and exporting of your

54
00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.730
subscription files. Cool. Right. So
RSS is the, is what

55
00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.670
happens on the wire when
you are requesting a feed

56
00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.360
and you get your, your
items, but OPM ML, that

57
00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.380
is the subscription format that
we use to import it.

58
00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.500
An export OPM L is
like a list of a

59
00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.440
list of fees. Yeah, exactly.
It's your subscription list? What

60
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.870
do you read your, your,
I used to use sharp

61
00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.050
reader now I'm using feed
Damon. Really? Yeah. So it

62
00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.660
seems like in the window
World, the, the, the three

63
00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:09.780
big ones are RSS bandit
shrinks.com/evh sharp reader. That's EBI

64
00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.200
and feed demon at AVJ.
And I'm a feed demon

65
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.320
guy myself. I've done both
RSS, bandit and sharp reader.

66
00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:18.810
And I'll talk about, there's
a feature that those guys

67
00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.750
have that feed demon. Doesn't,
that's pretty a pretty significant,

68
00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.310
but right now I'm a
feed demon guy as well.

69
00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.000
So a feed demon aggregator
right now is really doing

70
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.100
all the work, right. They
store the feeds, they go

71
00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.470
get the feeds. And plus
they're talking to their big

72
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.910
news Gator online world, right?
So they might want to

73
00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.550
integrate with When feed lists
let's can we back up

74
00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.500
just a little bit can
before we get in there,

75
00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.120
you just said something that
the news Gator online world,

76
00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.260
what is that? Well, news
Gator is more than just

77
00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.960
feed Damon in the newsletter
product, right? There's also net

78
00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.260
Newswire there Mac a downloader,
but one of the things

79
00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.010
people don't realize when you're
running a feed demon and

80
00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:02.970
you are synchronizing your feeds,
you're not actually going out

81
00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.410
to hanselman.com to get your
feed information. You may think

82
00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.470
you are, but what's really
happening is if you've synchronized

83
00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.380
your folder and feed demon
with what's called news Gator

84
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.160
online, you've got a new
username. You're actually getting that

85
00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.390
information from newscaster. So they
cash it. In other words,

86
00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.790
they're doing all the work.
It's very interesting. They've decided

87
00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:28.140
to get the feed themself
and then they are normalizing

88
00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:31.500
that feed and providing a,
basically a hash. So they

89
00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.030
can tell one item from
another Normalizing, meaning cleaning it

90
00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.160
up if it's not right,
or Yeah, a lot of

91
00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.250
feeds are, are crap. And
a lot of feeds don't

92
00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.700
have goods to make sure
that that, that item within

93
00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.790
a feed is a unique
item. Right? And it's difficult

94
00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:49.830
to tell because a lot
of people have created a

95
00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.050
lot of really sloppy RSS.
It's difficult to tell when

96
00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.750
an item has actually changed.
So news Gator has kind

97
00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:59.540
of a proprietary co you
internal secret sauce that they

98
00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:04.040
use to normalize to some
canonical format, all these different

99
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.500
feeds. And that's how they
tell whether you've read something

100
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.620
on one machine or on
another. I see. So I

101
00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.260
can read my feed demon
feeds at home, come to

102
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.470
work. And those same feeds
have been marked red. Nice.

103
00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.620
Well, that's great. Until of
course, news Gator had their

104
00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.110
recent outage and we were
unable to go get feed,

105
00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.790
Right? Single point of failure,
realize I realized that they

106
00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:26.590
were doing the work. I
thought I was going out

107
00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:30.070
and receiving all these feeds
From elsewhere. Yeah, I did

108
00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:32.590
too. I didn't know anything
about this. So that's the

109
00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:36.490
newscaster online world. So back
to the, the, the, the

110
00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:40.480
windows world, this is very
interesting. Basically, Those is doing

111
00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.540
the same thing that news
Gator's doing, except they're doing

112
00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:46.480
it on your computer rather
than in some mysterious cloud

113
00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:50.380
somewhere. So we talked about
bronze level, which they're calling

114
00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:52.480
the, just the integrating with
that common feed list. So

115
00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.900
there's a service that's available
in API. Silver is integrating

116
00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:59.440
with that list plus using
the platform to download the

117
00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:03.220
feeds. Huh? Right. So there's
actually a download engine that

118
00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:08.020
will do scheduled, downloading, parsing,
merging determination of whether the

119
00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:10.420
item has been new or
updated, all that kind of

120
00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:13.690
secret sauce that that news
Gator does at news Gator

121
00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:17.740
headquarters, the RSS team platform
will do for you. So

122
00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.260
you really just call the
RSS tech platform and say,

123
00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:22.810
Hey, give me this feed,
work it out and give

124
00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:25.000
it back to me in
a canonical format. Okay. And

125
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.520
just a couple more things
before we move on to

126
00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:31.630
the, the supporting <inaudible> for
RSS and the common feed

127
00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:34.570
list. Does that also deal
with enclosures? Yeah. So what

128
00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:37.480
they're doing is they're actually,
So using the background, intelligent

129
00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:42.160
transfer service to the downloading
of the enclosures. Sweet. So

130
00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.620
if you, If you decided
to write a new aggregator

131
00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.770
today, and you insisted that
someone have this RSS platform

132
00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:50.170
on your machine, you would
have a lot less work

133
00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:52.210
to do than the guys
that have written, you know,

134
00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:54.160
the feed demons and the
sh and the sharp Raiders,

135
00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.500
because now you're going to
get a complete RSS platform

136
00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:59.290
with a feed list, right.
A download engine. And then

137
00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:01.810
if you go at the
gold level and actual feed

138
00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:03.820
store, so you don't even
have to hold the feeds.

139
00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:07.770
Now, bronze, silver, and gold.
These are levels of, of

140
00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:10.990
service. These are levels. The
integration that the RSS team

141
00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:13.780
is kind of informally using
on their, on their blog

142
00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:17.830
to describe how much of
the kind of cafeteria plan

143
00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:20.830
of the windows RSS platform
you choose, But you can

144
00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:24.400
choose whichever level you want.
Of course. I see. And,

145
00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:26.320
and the other question I
have for you is, and

146
00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:29.830
I know this is cursory
information, but there's confusion out

147
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:34.330
there, Adam versus RSS. What
is Adam ATO M? So

148
00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:38.530
Adam Is an as another
take on RSS. There are

149
00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:41.830
a number of problems with
RSS from the point of

150
00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:46.660
view of the XML. Purists,
RSS is so simple that

151
00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:48.610
it's not really a very
good example of how to

152
00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:51.880
use XML, right? It has,
it has no namespace. It

153
00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:54.610
has a lot of features
that are not inside it.

154
00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:58.410
So people tacked them on
like, support for comments, support

155
00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:00.960
for attachments, you know, all
the I everyone's adding on

156
00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:06.320
to, I didn't go into
RSS. So Adam was Sam

157
00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:10.400
Ruby, and a number of
other folks, Ray expression of

158
00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:13.970
the need for a feed.
Yeah. And it's caused a

159
00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:15.890
lot of controversy because from
the point of view of

160
00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:18.410
the, you know, my mom
or my wife, they don't

161
00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:20.990
really care. They are, they
may just now start to

162
00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:24.080
understand the concept of a
feed. Right, Right. But they

163
00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.210
don't care what, what it
is. They don't care if

164
00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:29.840
it's Adam or if it's
a, Whatever, you know, there's

165
00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:33.560
an interesting link at shrinks.com/e
w zero. It's a feed

166
00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:36.710
stir comment about the concept
of RSS reach. They say

167
00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:40.340
that about four to 7%
of internet users are using

168
00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:46.100
RSS, but Yahoo says that
30% are using it. It's

169
00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:49.880
the four to 7% that
actually know that it exists.

170
00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:53.150
So when you think about
RSS reach, does that mean

171
00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:54.920
that I am using it?
And I know about it

172
00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:57.620
might mean I don't, my
wife doesn't know about SMTP.

173
00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:00.410
Right. Right. You know, my
mom doesn't care about pop

174
00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:04.840
three email. Exactly. She knows
about email. So measuring RSS

175
00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:06.740
reach new, do you need
to understand what RSS is

176
00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:10.880
to use it? Ideally? No.
So Adam is another kind

177
00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.370
of reinvention of that. Now
this has caused controversy because

178
00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:17.150
the gentleman who created RSS
is, is not the friendliest

179
00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:19.610
towards the Adam folks. And
the Adam folks are very

180
00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:21.830
much focused on getting the
standard right. And making it

181
00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:26.180
a proper XML. And then
interestingly, Google had comes along.

182
00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:30.020
And if you go to
shrinks.com/edw one, which is a

183
00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:34.760
code.google.com site, you'll see that
Google, Google has released a

184
00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:41.390
merge, basically their expression of
a called G data, which

185
00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:47.270
is Adam RSS together. Wow.
As a single Protocol. And

186
00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:49.940
also including a number of
things like open search, which

187
00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:52.730
is a thing from Amazon
that allows you to aggregate

188
00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:57.650
search results. And they've got,
they've got data up there

189
00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:00.080
on, on how to use
it. And C sharp and

190
00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:03.620
Java. They've got detailed information
about the protocol. It's, it's

191
00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:06.710
really, it's very clever. You
can, you can use the

192
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:10.100
format, not just to get
information, but also to create

193
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:14.600
new entries. When you have
a nice clean format, like

194
00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.580
Adam, a lot of people
started coming up with ways

195
00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:20.420
to use, use Adam to
create a new entry. So

196
00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:22.640
rather than just doing an
HTTP, get to get the

197
00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:25.100
information, you would actually post
an entry. And that would

198
00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:27.320
be like doing an, you
know, an insert. So you,

199
00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:30.860
do you see Adam taking
over RSS as the default

200
00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:33.920
standard for feeds or what's
the story there? Well, see,

201
00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:37.730
everyone has pledged support for
both and that's where it

202
00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:40.460
gets sloppy. So now we're
just, we're going to think

203
00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:43.250
feeds. But what I think
is going on is that

204
00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:47.240
Adam is the beta max
Of the formats where it's

205
00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:50.480
RSS is the more popular
one. Adam might be better,

206
00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:53.320
but it's not as popular.
Exactly. And that's, I mean,

207
00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:55.060
that's the best. And you
know, that's just the way

208
00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:57.430
it is. And whenever there's
us, and then there's blue

209
00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:01.930
Ray and there's HD HD
DVD, or whatever, one's better

210
00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:04.630
and one will succeed. But
you know, when you get

211
00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:07.000
somebody like Google that says,
well, there's nice things. I'm

212
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.250
going to take, take a
little here, take a little

213
00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:10.720
there. And then they decided
to use it in their

214
00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:15.460
new Google calendar as their,
the format, the Google calendar

215
00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:18.720
speaks. It's pretty hot. Now
where's Microsoft. I mean, Google

216
00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:22.170
has got their answer to
Adam and RSS. Where's Microsoft

217
00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:25.170
in this. Well, Microsoft has
As proposed a number of

218
00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:27.390
different, you know, over the
last couple of months, proposed

219
00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:30.360
extending things in this way,
in that way. But from

220
00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:32.640
my point of view, the
only people who have successfully

221
00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:37.200
changed RSS, you know, in
any fundamental, substantial way is

222
00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:42.540
iTunes for adding all the
different iTunes specific feeds tags

223
00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:48.090
rather, and, and Google. So
I see, I see Microsoft

224
00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:50.430
making it easier for all
of us to use RSS,

225
00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:54.600
but I haven't seen a
lot of clever changes. Yeah.

226
00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:57.480
Was no innovation really from
them in, I wouldn't say

227
00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:00.240
innovation, they're not innovating in
the protocol. That's what I

228
00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:02.100
mean, They've come up with
a number of different things,

229
00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:04.110
their expression of what a
list is and stuff like

230
00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:07.140
that. But it was kind
of released to two pans.

231
00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:09.550
I mean, the protocol, that's
what I'm talking about. Yeah.

232
00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:12.120
Yeah. But what they're doing
is, you know, when you,

233
00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:13.560
when you just go and
write a little bit of

234
00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:15.420
code three lines of code
and.net to go and say,

235
00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:17.700
give me some RSS, it's
not going to be smart.

236
00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:20.490
It's gonna, it's gonna beat
on the, on the server.

237
00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:22.680
And it's gonna ask for
that over and over and

238
00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:24.480
over. And maybe you set
it every 30 seconds. I

239
00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.610
mean, you know how this
is, you get stupid aggregators.

240
00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:30.660
They beat on franklins.net. Yeah.
If someone could say, give

241
00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:34.680
me a feed and windows
would handle conditional gets and

242
00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:38.460
can handle being clever about
scheduling an update in the

243
00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:45.390
background. Right. Bandwidth friendly using
all the appropriate HTTP protocol

244
00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:48.030
things to, to say, I've
already got this cash. I

245
00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:50.520
just want this little bit.
Yeah. That's just gonna make

246
00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:54.630
everyone wins. So Microsoft's innovating
in the API space right

247
00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:58.380
here. That's digging around in
the RSS team. Blog is

248
00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:01.110
a really, a really useful
thing to do, I think.

249
00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:04.380
Okay. Okay. What's next? So
there's a, I wanna just

250
00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:05.790
Talk about a number of
different things that are going

251
00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:09.360
on. First, the three, like
I said, the three RSS

252
00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:12.000
readers that I've really noticed
in the, in the windows

253
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.090
fat client space or a
news Gator at a shrink

254
00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:19.230
stir EVG are suspended at
EVH sharp reader at EBI.

255
00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:23.550
Now RSS banded and sharp
reader support something really neat

256
00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:26.040
that a news gate news,
Gator, and feed demon and

257
00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:29.130
feed him. And as DVJ
don't support and that's RSS

258
00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:32.790
comments, not a lot of
blog engine support this, but

259
00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:35.730
this allows you to get
another RSS feed. That is

260
00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:39.570
the comment on a particular
post and both are suspended

261
00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:42.930
in news Gator. When the
backing a server supports, it

262
00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:46.200
will show like threaded discussions,
like an NTP, like a

263
00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:51.770
newsgroup appearing underneath the, The
post. So like DAS blogs

264
00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:54.380
supports RSS comments. Now this
is something that a lot

265
00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:57.770
of blogging engines don't support.
And I think it's a

266
00:14:57.770 --> 00:15:00.050
damn shame because, you know,
I hate to visit a

267
00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:02.570
site just to find that
if anyone commented on stuff.

268
00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:06.530
Yeah. So interestingly, and this
is where I get frustrated.

269
00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:11.990
There's a, a website called
co comment.com at <inaudible> dot

270
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:16.340
com slash V K. These
guys have a weird little

271
00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:20.090
JavaScript hack that you put
in your bookmark list. And

272
00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:22.100
just before, you're about to
leave a comment, you push

273
00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:25.130
a button and they insert
some JavaScript on the page

274
00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:27.590
of whatever blog you're visiting.
And then when you submit

275
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:31.160
your comment, they grab the
submission and they submit it

276
00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:34.810
to themselves Was as well,
huh? This one, They'll keep

277
00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:37.960
a list of all the
blogs you're commenting on and

278
00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:41.590
give you a single, your
conversations, RSS feed, which is

279
00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:44.080
a list of all the
different feeds that your comments,

280
00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:48.340
rather than you look nice
as a concept, but using

281
00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:52.360
JavaScript and Ajax and insisting
that someone clicked on a

282
00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:55.960
button in order to cause
it and to, to basically

283
00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:59.740
ignore a perfectly good spec
Says comments. Well, I like

284
00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:01.750
the idea though. I mean,
at least it shows that

285
00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:04.240
somebody's thinking enough to come
up with a solution in

286
00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:06.160
the first place. Yeah. I
think it shows there's a

287
00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:09.730
problem. Yeah. There's definitely a
problem. And I mean, don't

288
00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:12.040
you agree that, you know,
it's hard to get involved

289
00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:14.890
in the conversation. I agree.
Yeah. It Def indefinitely. You're

290
00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:17.860
right. About pushing the button.
That's ridiculous. It should just

291
00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:20.560
happen. And it would be
even nicer if they would

292
00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:23.710
detect what blogs support RSS
comments, and then pull it

293
00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:27.100
as a data feed. Yeah.
So I think if more

294
00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:32.200
aggregators started supporting RSS comments
and that became a formal,

295
00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:35.890
a formal thing that people
cared about would be, we'd

296
00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:37.690
be A nice spot. So
I got to ask you

297
00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:40.420
as a developer of, of
DAS blog, does DAS blog

298
00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:43.270
support RSS comments? Yeah. So
if you go up on

299
00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:46.810
my blog supports both RSS
comments and I also really

300
00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:49.840
support for co comment. So
I have this post on

301
00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:52.150
my blog where I complain
about how co comments sucks.

302
00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:54.850
And then at the very
end, I really support for

303
00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:58.390
it. You know, because it's
really not about my opinion.

304
00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:00.940
It's about if it works
or not. Right. I mean,

305
00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:03.550
this is the thing, people,
you know, VHS is a

306
00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:06.400
crap format, but videotapes worked
for a very long time,

307
00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:10.090
right? So who are we
to complain? Yeah. Now on

308
00:17:10.090 --> 00:17:12.550
the, on the website, there's
a lot of really cool

309
00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:15.540
stuff that you can do
with, with RSS and, and

310
00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:18.490
getting involved in the conversation.
That's, that's more than just

311
00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:21.820
getting feeds. You can take
a look at share dot

312
00:17:21.850 --> 00:17:25.690
<inaudible> dot org. It shrinks
your.com/avl. This is a thing

313
00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:28.180
that Dave Weiner, the creator
of RSS is doing, where

314
00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:31.000
he encourages you to upload
your own PML, your list

315
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.970
of subscriptions, and then he'll
apply an algorithm to it,

316
00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:36.430
and then give you suggestions
of other blogs that might

317
00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:38.920
be like the kinds of
stuff that you like to

318
00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:42.010
read. Wow. He'll also connect
you with people who may

319
00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:44.560
have similar interests with you
based on this kind of

320
00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:48.760
algorithm that he comes up
with. Wow. So I actually

321
00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.730
found out that a buddy
of mine, Mitch, Denny is

322
00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:53.490
listed as number two as
the guy who has subscriptions

323
00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:55.640
most like me, which makes
sense. Cause he He's a.net

324
00:17:55.640 --> 00:18:00.110
guy. I like Mitch. Denny's
a shrink, stir a component

325
00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:03.500
that automatically shrinks to rises
URLs that you copied to

326
00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:06.170
the clipboard. He's a good
guy. Yeah. He is. Now

327
00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.700
a lot of people who
have blogs want to be

328
00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:09.860
able to find out if
people are in fact talking

329
00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:12.440
about them, right? So there's
a number of different ways

330
00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:14.510
to find out if you're,
if you're being talked about.

331
00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:17.090
And one of them that's
really interesting is that blog

332
00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:20.900
lines.com blog lines is an
online aggregator. So rather than

333
00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:27.680
having a fat client, you
log in and you look@yoursubscriptionsandatbloglinesdotcomslashcitationsatshrinks.com

334
00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:30.950
slash EVM, you can type
in the address for your

335
00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:35.450
blog. And it will find
within its list of blogs,

336
00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:38.900
other folks that are talking
about you. Cool. Now there

337
00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:41.090
are, there are ways for
blogs to communicate to each

338
00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:44.120
other, like with things like
trackbacks where I would post

339
00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:47.270
about you, Carl and my
blog would then send a

340
00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:50.360
little notice to your blog,
right? And let, let you

341
00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:53.930
know, we're talking about you,
right? But most, most blogs

342
00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:56.600
don't support that I'm afraid.
And sometimes those are lost

343
00:18:57.050 --> 00:18:59.240
and a lot of conversations
occur and you don't get

344
00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:01.010
to jump in and say,
Oh, Hey, I've got an

345
00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:05.120
opinion about that. Right? That
blog lines.com/citations is, is an

346
00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:07.220
interesting search engine. I've been
using that more and more.

347
00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:11.630
Another one is ice rocket.
This is Mark Cuban's company.

348
00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:17.690
And they've got an interesting
thing@atatrendingsiteatshrinker.com slash EVP. This is

349
00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:20.900
ice rocket. And they'll tell
you, given some terms, how

350
00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:23.090
are they trending in the
blogosphere? You know, are more

351
00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:27.260
people talking about David Blaine
now than before? Or how

352
00:19:27.530 --> 00:19:30.170
are people talking about monad
or PowerShell? And what is

353
00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:33.890
the trend of these different
terms over time? It's funny,

354
00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:36.530
you mentioned David Blaine. I
was just reading a, I

355
00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:39.650
just read a new story
about him, where he almost

356
00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:43.160
died. Trying to set the
record for holding your breath

357
00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:46.190
after being trapped under water
for a week. Yeah. He

358
00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:47.960
only made it for seven
minutes and the record was

359
00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:53.570
eight minutes, 59 right now,
another interesting place to get

360
00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:56.330
more information about blogs you
might want to read or

361
00:19:56.330 --> 00:20:00.500
other people's subscription files is
Chris Parillo is gotta be

362
00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:04.310
GA D a B E
gotta be. If you can't

363
00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:06.290
remember that it's at <inaudible>
dot com slash E V

364
00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:10.220
N as in Nancy EVN.
And his is a really

365
00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:14.330
interesting service that is almost
entirely based on the URLs.

366
00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:17.810
It's kind of like delicious
or Technorati where you get

367
00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:21.050
to type in extensions on
the, in the URL. So

368
00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:24.230
if you go like gotta
be a slash D slash

369
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:27.440
Hanselman, then it'll go and
it'll search like 200 different

370
00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:30.950
sources that he pulls from,
aggregate them. And he'll give

371
00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:33.710
you an RSS feed that
tells you where the word

372
00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:37.640
Hanselman appears or where the
word Carl Franklin appears somewhere. And

373
00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:41.120
then he will also create
an an OPL file that

374
00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:44.690
you can import into your
reader and monitor things. Now

375
00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:47.470
that can be done for
ego purposes, you can go

376
00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:51.790
to shrinks.com/evo and see who's
talking about me, but think

377
00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:54.340
about if you were a
marketer or a PR person,

378
00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:55.990
and you wanted to find
out if people were talking

379
00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:58.900
about the competition, talking about
a product that you're trying

380
00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:00.850
to promote, these are the
kinds of things that you

381
00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:04.360
could generate reports on and
let your clients know that

382
00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:08.800
you are, you know, focused
and, and making substantive change

383
00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:12.010
in the blogosphere, getting people
talking about their stuff. Yeah.

384
00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:16.300
Other places you can find
more information. Our feed stir.com.

385
00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:21.070
This is another nice blog
search engine at strange.com/ebq. And

386
00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:23.800
then of course there's Google's
own blog. Search it, Eva

387
00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:29.260
Z. Now interestingly blogs, search.google.com.
Their Google blogs shirts is

388
00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:31.510
kind of lame. I have
not found it to be

389
00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:37.210
that clever. And I have
consistently not got good results

390
00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:39.090
from it. I don't know
if you've tried that When

391
00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:42.780
or not. Yeah, I agree.
The many Google properties, that

392
00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:46.320
one just not so much
a Google's online reader. Also

393
00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:52.020
the google.com/reader at EDW, not
so much another nice one's

394
00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:55.860
called pub sub pub sub
pub sub at <inaudible> dot

395
00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:58.890
com slash E V Y
pub sub will also create

396
00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:03.990
search results, oriented RSS feeds
for you looking on particular

397
00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:09.150
tags, really RSS being so,
so flexible. And so loose

398
00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:12.720
has really lended lent itself
to this notion of tagging.

399
00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:16.050
We talked about delicious and
how you can tag information

400
00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:20.640
Technorati is another site where
you can tag posts with

401
00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:24.210
the topics that give some
semantic meaning to it, to

402
00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:26.970
a topic rather than the,
the blog engine. Having to

403
00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:29.490
look at the content and
decide whether or not it's

404
00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:34.320
about XML or whether it's
about.net, you actually explicitly tag

405
00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:36.390
it with that information. And
then these other engines can

406
00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:39.660
use that context to decide
whether our searches are relevant

407
00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:42.870
to you. I really like
Technorati love it. I've been

408
00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:44.970
using it for It's a
little complicated and there's so

409
00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:47.040
much content up there because
you know, the contents really

410
00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:49.800
being built by the users.
They're adding information, they're adding

411
00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:52.350
new tech Eggs every day.
Yep. And there, they're also

412
00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:55.080
experimenting with some, you know,
a lot of, I don't

413
00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:57.510
know, almost like marketing. There's
a lot of banner ads

414
00:22:57.510 --> 00:22:59.850
and stuff up there. Now
they're popping up. It's getting

415
00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:01.920
kind of flooded. It's a
little disturbing when, when the

416
00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:04.380
site's not so clean, as
it used to be right.

417
00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:06.420
Used to be clean. Now,
have you looked at, you've

418
00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:10.620
looked@live.com. Yeah. I love live.com
and that, that, that site,

419
00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:12.810
I wasn't feeling it. Yeah.
Early on when it was

420
00:23:12.810 --> 00:23:14.790
like, you know, it used
to be what surf was

421
00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:17.490
it? search.com or it's like
a S yeah, but it's,

422
00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:20.700
it's, it's working so nicely
in Firefox now. It's very

423
00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:25.530
clean. It's, it's so easy
to add an RSS feed

424
00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:28.230
off of live.com. You know,
I tell ya, I like

425
00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:31.050
Google, but you know, the
call of the new stuff

426
00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:34.440
is, is, is hard to
ignore. And the, the nice

427
00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:37.950
clean interface of live.com, you
know, I may switch it

428
00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:40.440
to my homepage. Wow. And
that would be it. That

429
00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:42.300
would be quite the coup
Google has been my homepage

430
00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:45.410
for a very long time.
Wow. Now have, did you

431
00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:47.540
know, you can develop stuff
for live.com. They've got these

432
00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:51.650
live.com web parts. Yeah. Did
you, did you attend mix

433
00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:54.460
a mix? I've got a
mix. Wish I could, but

434
00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:56.440
I couldn't. I had a,
I had a wife with

435
00:23:56.440 --> 00:24:01.630
the who couldn't walk syndrome.
That'll do it. Yeah. Everyone

436
00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:04.030
I talked to said it
was just fantastic. That's what

437
00:24:04.030 --> 00:24:06.190
I heard. If you've grown
tired of tech, ed or

438
00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:09.040
PDC, there was just a
totally different tone. It mix

439
00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:12.640
those six and they've released
all of the sessions at

440
00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:16.660
shrinks, your.com/evs. This is it
sessions that makes those six.com.

441
00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:21.070
They've got the sessions, the
demos, PowerPoints, and everything. So

442
00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:24.250
if you wanted to do
some experimentation to actually develop

443
00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:28.060
against like the RSS teams,
API APIs, you can download

444
00:24:28.090 --> 00:24:31.150
internet Explorer, seven beta to
take a look at some

445
00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:35.020
of the RSS teams slides.
They've got sample code for

446
00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:38.950
an RSS screensaver. You could
probably write an aggregator in

447
00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:41.530
a couple of hundred lines
of code pretty easily. Yeah.

448
00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:44.440
I've spent some serious time
going over the sessions that

449
00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:48.250
mix Oh six.com. Now you're
writing. I was just going

450
00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:51.040
to say, you're writing an
aggregator. I am. Yeah, it's

451
00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:55.330
called pop catcher. And you
can download it. Plop catcher.com.

452
00:24:55.330 --> 00:24:58.360
It's in alpha right now,
but it's a.net aggregator. It

453
00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:01.090
doesn't work with RSS text,
but it's all it's really

454
00:25:01.090 --> 00:25:06.430
for managing podcasts and podcasts
and downloads in it. I'm

455
00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:08.890
thinking as much about what
to do with the podcast.

456
00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:11.980
Once you've downloaded them, the
downloading itself has done with

457
00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:15.850
HDDP or a bit torn.
I'm actually embedding in the

458
00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:22.120
next version. Anyway, I'm embedding
micro torrent, utorrent.com as a

459
00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:27.100
DLL into the application. I
actually got a permission from

460
00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:29.440
the author of micro torrent
to do this as an

461
00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:34.240
exclusive thing. Micro Torreon is
a BitTorrent client. That's 155

462
00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:37.720
K totally standalone doesn't require
any installation. You know, you

463
00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:40.990
turned me on to uTorrent,
to micro torrent. Yeah, you

464
00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:43.960
totally spoiled me, man. You,
I had, you know, this

465
00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:46.330
was actually the first tool
that I hadn't heard of

466
00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:51.430
yet. Wow. I might crash
Utorrent.com. This thing kicks complete,

467
00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:54.370
but It totally rocks. Doesn't
it? It is. It is

468
00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:57.520
so small. And so tight
allows you such flexibility and

469
00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:00.190
the downloading of the torrents.
And you know, they've got

470
00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:02.590
like places where you can
download a TV shows that

471
00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:06.520
you've missed. Like right now
I'm downloading that David Blaine

472
00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:10.060
show, Which is perfectly legal
because it's public TV. Is

473
00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:13.840
it? Yeah. It's legal. That's
critical to download TV shows

474
00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:16.390
that you've, that you, Cause
I've got it taped at

475
00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:18.220
home on the TiVo. I
just can't get into my

476
00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:20.620
house right now. I can't
VPN into my TiVo. At

477
00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:23.260
this point, I was thinking
about using orb.com. We talked

478
00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:25.810
about on a previous show,
but I've got very limited

479
00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:27.670
bandwidth right now. So I'm
just trying to get this

480
00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:34.240
updated via torrent. So pop
catcher uses.net. Of course. And

481
00:26:34.570 --> 00:26:37.480
as I said, I'm concerned
just as much as about

482
00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:39.790
what to do with the
podcasts once I have download

483
00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:42.460
them. So I have for
each feed, I have individual

484
00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:45.780
settings can put each feet
in a different folder. You

485
00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:48.450
get to choose where each
one goes, not some arbitrary

486
00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:53.730
folder. You get to determine
how many days old they

487
00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:57.210
should be. In other words,
if you say seven, seven

488
00:26:57.210 --> 00:26:59.850
days old, first thing that
happens is when you go

489
00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:01.800
to the feed, when, when
the feed goes and it

490
00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:04.620
looks through all the items,
it'll only download things you

491
00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:08.310
don't have that are less
than seven days old. And

492
00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:11.520
also before it runs, it
looks on your hard disc

493
00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:14.430
in that directory. And it
says, Hey, are there any,

494
00:27:14.790 --> 00:27:18.360
you know, podcasts here? Are
there any MP3 files or

495
00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:21.020
whatever that are more than
seven days old, Delete them?

496
00:27:21.050 --> 00:27:23.240
You know, it would be
very cool if you made

497
00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:25.400
a, an import. So I
could take all of my

498
00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:29.420
pod. I've got like 25
podcast in iTunes, but iTunes

499
00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:32.420
completely takes over my system
when I go and load

500
00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:34.610
it up and it tries
to update its podcast, right?

501
00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:36.920
It'd be awesome. If you
could be the alternative to

502
00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:39.770
iTunes podcast, you could import
my stuff. And then when

503
00:27:39.770 --> 00:27:42.080
it comes down, spit it
back into iTunes. Also the

504
00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:44.270
next version is going to
have plugin support. So I'm

505
00:27:44.270 --> 00:27:48.410
encouraging dotnet plugin writers to
get control before the feed

506
00:27:48.410 --> 00:27:52.520
gets a checked and before
and after an item gets

507
00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:54.650
downloaded. So you can do
whatever you want with the

508
00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:56.900
item. Of course, I give
you all the metadata about

509
00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:59.990
it. Very cool. Yep. And
you know, one thing that

510
00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:02.480
bugs me as I wrote,
wrote this, I get an

511
00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:05.360
email once in a while
that says, I'm having a

512
00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:08.960
problem with pop catcher. There's
a bug. And I'm getting

513
00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:12.680
this error on this particular
feed. And the error is

514
00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:15.770
like invalid character in path
or something like that. So

515
00:28:15.770 --> 00:28:24.290
I look@thefeedandipopitintofeedvalidatoratfeedvalidatordotorgandfeedvalidator.org is a site
that's set up to look

516
00:28:24.290 --> 00:28:26.780
through the RSS and determine
whether or not it's valid,

517
00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:29.930
according to the rules of
RSS. And you know, these

518
00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:33.710
there's just flagrant violations of
the protocol in there. And

519
00:28:33.770 --> 00:28:37.550
you know, like they're, they're
appending onto the MP3 file,

520
00:28:37.910 --> 00:28:41.570
extra meta information because it's
actually not downloading an MP

521
00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:47.840
three file. It's like downloading
some, you know, custom, you

522
00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:50.420
know, there's some custom handler
on the web server side.

523
00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:53.390
That's looking at that and
validating it somehow, but there's

524
00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:56.210
extra stuff. And it's like,
you know, my podcast dot

525
00:28:56.210 --> 00:29:00.560
MP3 question, Mark blahdy, blahdy,
blah, which is just not

526
00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:05.450
allowed. So, so I'm basically
having, you know, and then

527
00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:07.940
people are telling me that,
you know, my, my program

528
00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:11.300
has a bug when, because
I'm not being, you know,

529
00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:17.030
forgiving enough. And my question
is, you know, my question

530
00:29:17.030 --> 00:29:19.040
to you, you're a programmer.
How far should I go

531
00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:22.940
on this? I mean, how,
how far should I allow

532
00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:27.590
people to violate flagrantly the
RSS protocol? Well, This is

533
00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:29.450
the thing that's so ironic.
I mean, what is H

534
00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:34.820
what is XHTML XHTML was
everyone who was sick of

535
00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:39.140
dealing with flaky and weird
HTML, parsers. Remember HTML is

536
00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:42.100
not well formed. Right? Know,
I remember back in the

537
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:44.620
day when you'd get six
or seven tables deep, and

538
00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:46.840
then Netscape four would blow
up because you were doing

539
00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:49.510
too many crazy things with
one pixel gifts, right? And

540
00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:54.010
XHTML is, is, is everyone's
all the programmers backlash. So

541
00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:59.020
now what's happened is RSS
was not very tight. Initially

542
00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:02.020
people break all sorts of
basic rules of encoding. And

543
00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:04.210
if you look at some
of the, the list of

544
00:30:04.210 --> 00:30:07.360
developer lists of tools like
RSS, bandit, and you can

545
00:30:07.550 --> 00:30:11.890
watch them struggle with the,
well, gosh, this popular blogging

546
00:30:11.890 --> 00:30:16.000
engine makes really crappy RSS,
do we three support them

547
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.520
or do we risk alienating
them? Right. You know, how

548
00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:20.530
do you do you put
pressure on them? And I

549
00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:24.430
think that's why Microsoft is
putting all of that, that

550
00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:28.390
RSS spackle into the platform.
They're saying it's really not

551
00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:32.200
our issue. It shouldn't be
your issue, right. Feeds are

552
00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:36.460
going to be crap. And
just as a, just as,

553
00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:39.010
there's not a button to
push an internet Explorer that

554
00:30:39.010 --> 00:30:43.060
says, don't show me crappy
HTML sites. And cause if

555
00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:44.950
you did that half the
half, the web would stop

556
00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:47.530
working. The same thing is
the issue with RSS one

557
00:30:47.530 --> 00:30:49.060
day, it will be, it
will be better, but I

558
00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:51.070
don't think we'll get more
than 80% of the feeds

559
00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:53.940
valid. Yeah. One of the
things that I had thought

560
00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:57.480
of doing was firing off
an email to the webmaster,

561
00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:01.770
which is a field in
the RSS document itself. And

562
00:31:01.770 --> 00:31:03.930
there's also, there's a couple
email addresses that are in

563
00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:08.760
the RSS if done correctly.
And, and just saying that,

564
00:31:08.790 --> 00:31:11.340
you know, this feed right
here is not well formed.

565
00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:14.520
I suggest you check out
feed, validator.org, you know, and

566
00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:17.100
clean up this problem. But
you know, that would be

567
00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:19.770
a little rude. I think,
especially if they, you know,

568
00:31:19.890 --> 00:31:22.920
hundreds or thousands of people
subscribed to their feeds and

569
00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:25.260
all of a sudden they're
getting pummeled with co-op catcher

570
00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:27.780
emails. Yeah. If I got
any Email, every time someone

571
00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:29.280
got a four Oh four
on my site, it would

572
00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:31.770
be a bummer. I know,
but you know, I seriously

573
00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:34.710
think about it like that
with, with great pleasure. I

574
00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:36.690
would take great pleasure in
doing that. Of course. It

575
00:31:36.690 --> 00:31:39.060
would be horrible though. Yeah.
All right. What else we

576
00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:41.760
got? We had at the
DAS blog team recently made

577
00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:43.680
a change in our, in
our engine kind of a

578
00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:46.110
change. We didn't think it
was a big deal where

579
00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:48.840
we would got rid of
HTTP colon slash slash. And

580
00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:51.660
we switched all of our
feeds to feed colon slash

581
00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:56.760
slash. This is a pluggable
protocol that just like mail

582
00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:59.070
to colon and things like
that, where you click on

583
00:31:59.070 --> 00:32:02.100
a link and it launches
an external program feed colon

584
00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:04.950
slash slash was our way
of making it easier to

585
00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:07.560
subscribe to DAS blog, feed
you click, and it pops

586
00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:10.950
up in your default agri.
Yep. Lot of people freaked

587
00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:14.340
out, right? They weren't, they
weren't feeling it. But then

588
00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:17.550
again, Scott, you know, we
were just, we were producing

589
00:32:17.550 --> 00:32:20.910
a show for blue P
for EMS Eastern mountain sports

590
00:32:20.910 --> 00:32:23.520
called blue pizza. And I
can't give you the URL

591
00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:27.960
yet, cause it's not officially
open, but we had the

592
00:32:28.050 --> 00:32:32.280
RSS links to subscribe in
there and you know, they

593
00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:34.230
sent it around the company
and they got back all

594
00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:37.440
this feedback. That's like this
download link isn't working. It's

595
00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:40.970
just a bunch of characters
on my, so, you know

596
00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:42.950
what I mean? It's, it's
kind of the thing that

597
00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:47.480
syndication in general need. It
requires a certain level of

598
00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:50.120
education on the part of
the user. And I think

599
00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:54.170
that's what this, you know,
feed colon slash slash link

600
00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:57.590
is really trying to avoid
is that it, you know,

601
00:32:57.620 --> 00:32:59.690
Hey, let's try to make
it. You've got an aggregator.

602
00:32:59.690 --> 00:33:01.770
All you need to do
is install it. And if

603
00:33:01.770 --> 00:33:05.450
it, and hopefully it'll respond
to this type, Well, I'm,

604
00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:07.600
I'm going back and forth
with it because the issue

605
00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:09.970
is that fi colon slash
slash works great. If you

606
00:33:09.970 --> 00:33:12.370
have an aggregator that supports
it, like are suspended or

607
00:33:12.370 --> 00:33:14.620
like feed demon. But if
you have an online aggregator

608
00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:19.000
like blog lines, that's not
helpful at all. Right. Interestingly

609
00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.610
I E seven beta two,
doesn't support it. And I've

610
00:33:21.610 --> 00:33:23.620
got a very interesting back
and forth I've had with

611
00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:26.740
the RSS team at Microsoft
about why they don't feel

612
00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:29.800
that it's an unnecessary feature.
Yeah. So they're not thinking

613
00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:31.630
that they're going to support
it. And they actually have

614
00:33:31.630 --> 00:33:34.720
some built in code that
gleans whether or not what

615
00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:37.480
they were about to download
is a feed. Yeah. So

616
00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:40.210
not only do they have
to deal with malformed XML,

617
00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:43.810
they also have to deal
with wrong mime types. They

618
00:33:43.810 --> 00:33:46.060
have to actually look at
the first, you know, some

619
00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:49.540
number of bites. And, and
guess if this is RSS,

620
00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:51.670
There's a way that I'm
going to be addressing this

621
00:33:51.670 --> 00:33:54.460
with pop catcher, which is
to make a, a, a,

622
00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:58.570
a file extension, a mime
file extension that a pop

623
00:33:58.570 --> 00:34:01.420
catcher understands. So instead in,
you know, if you have

624
00:34:01.450 --> 00:34:05.500
pop catcher, click this button
and, and it will download

625
00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:09.700
that file, which just essentially
includes the RSS. Right. So

626
00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:12.160
you're basically getting around it
by saying, well, I don't

627
00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:16.000
know about you guys, meaning
everybody else who is kind

628
00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.680
of in the middle of
the Chaos, nor do I

629
00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:19.900
want to establish a standard.
I just want, you know,

630
00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:22.360
here's what I just want
it to work. Right? Yeah.

631
00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:24.910
That's why I really think
that the feed colon slash

632
00:34:24.910 --> 00:34:26.590
slash was a great idea.
And I'm, I'm going to

633
00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:28.690
post on my blog as
soon as they give me

634
00:34:28.690 --> 00:34:31.330
the, okay. The, the conversation
that we've had, it's been,

635
00:34:31.330 --> 00:34:34.270
it's been very interesting. I
think it's just going to

636
00:34:34.270 --> 00:34:36.190
come down to, they're going
to decide, and I'm going

637
00:34:36.190 --> 00:34:38.140
to complain about it, but
I don't see how you

638
00:34:38.140 --> 00:34:40.150
can get rid of feed
Collins slash last, just like

639
00:34:40.150 --> 00:34:42.640
you can't get rid of
mail to our, you know,

640
00:34:42.910 --> 00:34:46.630
real players, our STP and,
and all those other plugable

641
00:34:46.630 --> 00:34:49.420
protocols. Right. Unfortunately, I can
see where they, they would

642
00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:52.870
probably come from a, from
a position of, well, we

643
00:34:52.870 --> 00:34:54.760
don't know if we're going
to call them feeds, right?

644
00:34:55.210 --> 00:34:57.370
Yeah. Well, ultimately I think
the issue is that they

645
00:34:57.370 --> 00:35:00.100
want to support more than
one aggregator on the system

646
00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:02.560
because the RSS team is
not trying to be an

647
00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:06.190
aggregator. They're trying to be
a platform and putting feed

648
00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:10.450
colon slash slash undermines that,
that concept of a platform

649
00:35:10.450 --> 00:35:14.230
and indicates that there is
one official feed handler on

650
00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:18.100
this machine. What about just
RSS as an extension? Yeah.

651
00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:23.260
Yeah. That's a good idea.
I've always thought that.dot XML

652
00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:25.090
would be a bad idea.
I don't see why a

653
00:35:25.090 --> 00:35:28.750
mime type wouldn't work, but
so many web servers return

654
00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:31.570
the wrong mime type. And
officially you're supposed to return.

655
00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:34.120
I think it's like application
slash XML, which just tells

656
00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:35.830
you it's XML. It doesn't
tell you that it's RSS.

657
00:35:36.130 --> 00:35:38.970
Okay. Well, Scott, that's a
show. Thanks For slogging it

658
00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:40.890
out in Pittsburgh there. And
your hotel room. Hope you

659
00:35:40.890 --> 00:35:43.620
didn't wake anybody up. It's
about midnight now. Time to

660
00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:45.060
go to bed and then
do it all again tomorrow.

661
00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:47.850
All right. And we'll talk
to you next time on

662
00:35:47.850 --> 00:35:55.380
handsome. <inaudible>.
