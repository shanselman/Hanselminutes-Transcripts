Hi, this is Scott Hanselman.

8
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.630
This is another episode of
Hansel minutes. I'm talking with

9
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.230
on Genova keel. She's a
technologist and software developer at

10
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.170
Uber research. How are you?
Hi, doing great. Thanks. You

11
00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.830
have got a video online
that I would encourage everyone

12
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:06.290
who enjoys great talks, great
podcasts, great teaching. And I'm

13
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.470
going to make you feel
bad cause I'm gushing. You

14
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.490
have a YouTube it's called
learning functional programming with JavaScript.

15
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.670
It was a talk you
did last last year, almost

16
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.460
a year to the day,
and it's just a great

17
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.680
solid 30 minutes that puts
functional programming. Like for humans

18
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.730
out there that talked out
has almost a half million

19
00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.420
views. Why did that talk
pop when so many other

20
00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.030
talks just get a couple
hundred views and we forget

21
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.480
about them. Well, you know,
that, that talk is funny.

22
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.630
So that talk was given
at a conference called JS

23
00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.890
unconscious, which follows the, the
kind of bar camber unconference

24
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.980
format where no talks are
scheduled and people just get

25
00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.420
up at the beginning of
the day and kind of

26
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.910
pitch the talks that they
could give or would like

27
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.190
to give. And everybody votes
and selects the talks they

28
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.280
want to see. And I
think one reason that the

29
00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.810
talk is so popular is
that there was a ton

30
00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.170
of interest and there still
is in functional programming among

31
00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.760
the web developer community, because
it's something that, you know,

32
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.750
there's been all these cool
functional frameworks and functional front

33
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.710
end languages coming out and
it's sort of was taken

34
00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.380
for granted that everyone understood
what that meant. And I

35
00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.450
think a lot of people,
you know, had never worked

36
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.680
in a functional mindset in
that paradigm before. So I

37
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.720
was at this conference and
people were interested in to

38
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.390
talk on functional programming and
nobody was, was proposing one.

39
00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.520
So I said, well, all
right. I just recently learned

40
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.060
a little bit about functional
programming. Let me share with

41
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.760
you what I've learned. And
I think it was about

42
00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.690
six months after I first
encountered functional programming as a

43
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.780
thing. And I think the
fact that it's, it was

44
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.580
my approach to take people
along with me on what

45
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:56.960
I had gathered as a
normal person. Non-expert in computer

46
00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.480
science, not an expert in
type theory or all of

47
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.320
these, you know, crazy Haskell
programmers that have been doing

48
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.380
pure functional programming day in
day out for 20 years.

49
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.990
The fact that I was
just, you know, some person

50
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.600
trying to wrap her head
around functional programming, and I

51
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.810
was able to, to kind
of walk people through the

52
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.300
things that I have struggled
with and how I had

53
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.050
learnt to wrap my head
around them. I think people

54
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.150
like those kinds of talks.
I know, I love seeing

55
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.750
those kinds of talks at
conferences. So I, I hope,

56
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.880
you know, we see that
trend continue and we see

57
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.120
more talks from kind of
a everyday person perspective instead

58
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.250
of the, I am the
expert and I will explain

59
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.590
everything to you perspective. That's,
that's actually what the show

60
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.660
tries to do. That's like
what every talk that I've

61
00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.790
ever done tries to do.
So I love that you

62
00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:50.490
appreciate that. Like presenting from
on high is so different

63
00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.740
from like, Hey, look at
this cool thing. I just

64
00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.030
discovered like the enthusiasm is
infectious. Yeah, exactly. And that's

65
00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.520
a, you know, that's something
that for me, gives me

66
00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.530
a lot of motivation of,
you know, when I'm surrounded

67
00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.020
by people that are just
excited about what they're doing

68
00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.440
and not, not trying to
show that it's something super

69
00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.190
hard that only geniuses and
rockstars and ninjas and whatever

70
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.220
it can do. I think,
you know, when, when you

71
00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.980
have somebody who's like, Hey,
let's sit down and look

72
00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.930
at this cause it's really
awesome. And I just learned

73
00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.660
it. That is something that,
you know, motivates me. And

74
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.730
I see a lot of
other people out there being

75
00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:26.100
motivated by that kind of
energy as well. So I

76
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.870
think, you know, if we
want to build a stronger

77
00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.630
community altogether, we need to
start talking to each other

78
00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.960
more on that level and
less on a, I will

79
00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.770
now, you know, explain to
you all of the ways

80
00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.700
in which my superior brain
has grappled with problems that

81
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.910
are too hard for you
to understand. Yeah. Yeah. When

82
00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.310
I, when I talk to
companies about what it means

83
00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.190
to be inclusive, people always
think it's about race and

84
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.310
gender, but it's also about
do we need to make

85
00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.620
everyone feel bad? Like, yes,
maybe I've been working on

86
00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.230
data sets and SQL for
the last 10 years, but

87
00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.180
I'm doing good work. I'm
doing amazing work. Do you

88
00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.800
have to come and say
monad within five minutes? Oh,

89
00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:09.150
and now I'm like, what's
a monad and I'm feeling

90
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.870
bad about myself. Like inclusivity
is about letting everyone make

91
00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.170
technology part of their life.
Absolutely. And you know, none

92
00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:20.400
of us know everything about
everything, none of us know

93
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.720
everything about functional programming or
any particular sub field. It's

94
00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:31.380
the space that programming and
computer science touches on nowadays,

95
00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.980
given the advances in the
last, you know, 50 years,

96
00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:38.490
a hundred years in these
type of these types of

97
00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.240
problems, it occupies just way
too much space. There's no

98
00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.130
way for one person to
have it all in their

99
00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:47.850
head. And we really need
to stop thinking that that's

100
00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:50.790
possible or the goal. There's
no reason that you need

101
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.340
to know everything. You just
need to know, you know

102
00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:55.200
who to go ask when
you, when you need to

103
00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.920
know something more specific about
a problem. And I think

104
00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.190
that you, you, you downplay
your expertise a little bit.

105
00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:07.990
You have a master's degree
and you study speech recognition

106
00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:10.450
and machine learning and natural
language processing and all that

107
00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:12.880
kind of stuff. There's still
a little bit of a

108
00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.130
barrier to entry. Don't you
think for something like a

109
00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:18.010
topic like functional programming and
JavaScript, or where you really

110
00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:20.020
just off the top of
your head put out an

111
00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:22.840
awesome talk in a half
an hour? No. Well, I

112
00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:26.050
mean, one, one aspect of
that is that my background

113
00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:28.720
is a rather eclectic. So
I have a, I have

114
00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.140
a BA in philosophy, which
I, I didn't start out

115
00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.030
as a programmer. I wasn't
programming when I was in

116
00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.160
college. I mean, I had
done a little bit of,

117
00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:41.680
you know, blogging and modifying
my HTML and styling things

118
00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.350
with CSS and whatnot, but
I hadn't really done much

119
00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:49.960
actual programming in terms of
telling the computer to execute

120
00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:57.040
things. And so I, I
was a philosophy student. I

121
00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:00.100
then I was always in
love with different foreign languages.

122
00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:03.610
I love linguistics. I, I
became an English language teacher.

123
00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:06.040
I was teaching English as
a foreign language for, for

124
00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.740
several years. And I love
teaching. And I think teaching

125
00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:11.590
is a skill that sometimes
people think of these, you

126
00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:14.920
know, these, these quote unquote
soft skills. I really don't

127
00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:18.310
like the term, but they
think of them as somehow,

128
00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:23.440
you know, opposite to the
technical skills, the quote unquote

129
00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:26.770
hard skills that you need
to be a bad ass

130
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:32.530
Ninja, functional programmer. I think,
I think they're not at

131
00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:35.200
all. I think, you know,
the more people that can,

132
00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:38.650
can talk about the technology
that they're using and the

133
00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:41.320
technology that excites them in
a way that makes it

134
00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:45.040
accessible to other people, that's
exactly the inclusivity that you

135
00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:48.070
were talking about. We need
to include people in the

136
00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:50.950
software that we're working with,
the software that we're building.

137
00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:54.190
And so, yeah. So as
a teacher, I kind of

138
00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:56.650
had that always in the
back of my mind, you

139
00:07:56.650 --> 00:08:00.370
know, this idea of talking
to people about what I'm

140
00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:03.910
doing, of helping them come
with me on my learning

141
00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:07.150
journey. And so when I
started programming just before I

142
00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:12.100
went into grad school for
computational linguistics, I, I gravitated

143
00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:15.310
towards resources that made it
really friendly and accessible. You

144
00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:18.310
know, I think the first
time I really sat down

145
00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:20.920
and tried to teach myself
some programming. I mean, I

146
00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.500
wasn't teaching myself. I was
using a book, I think

147
00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:26.140
from the, the head first
series with O'Reilly, which is

148
00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:28.690
a series I like in
terms of, they try to

149
00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:34.180
make it an engaging and
interesting walk through of kind

150
00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:36.790
of basic programming concepts and
what they have a whole

151
00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:42.490
series. But I found that
actually got me into programming.

152
00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:44.740
Whereas the first time I
tried to take a computer

153
00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:47.890
science class in college, I
dropped it after a couple

154
00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:51.100
of weeks because it was
just so uninviting. It was

155
00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:54.340
just so sterile and dry
and there was no, no

156
00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:57.750
community speak of, of people
getting each other excited about

157
00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:00.270
it. So I, it wasn't
until much later that I,

158
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:06.870
that I found that community
and I studied, yeah, I

159
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:10.290
studied in the academic world.
Things like machine learning, as

160
00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:17.910
you mentioned, speech recognition and
the, the software that I

161
00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:20.310
was using to do the
research that I was working

162
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:25.230
on started interestingly, a lot,
actually a lot more than,

163
00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:27.270
than kind of doing the
actual research. And so I

164
00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:29.820
started getting curious about software
engineering as more of a

165
00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:32.760
discipline and kind of filling
in the gaps in my,

166
00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:35.010
in my computer science knowledge,
since I didn't have that

167
00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:39.630
formal background. And I eventually
found myself at a really

168
00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:45.210
amazing place in New York city
called the Recurse center, exactly.

169
00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:49.830
Recurse center. It's that recurse.com.
It's a programming community in

170
00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:52.590
New York. And they have basically
a space where you can

171
00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:55.230
go for what they call
a programming retreat, kind of

172
00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:59.370
like a writer's retreat. So
anyone who, who is already

173
00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:02.040
a coder, whether that's, you
know, they've been coding for

174
00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:05.910
two months or 20 years,
they can go and just

175
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:10.020
work on getting better at
programming, whatever that means to

176
00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:13.740
them. And so the emphasis
is it's it's is on

177
00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:21.480
completely following your own nose
and self-directed exploration of whatever

178
00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:25.440
topics or technologies, whether it's,
you know, new languages, new

179
00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:30.570
algorithms to you, whatever it
is that you're interested in,

180
00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:33.780
you can just follow that
in a supportive environment with

181
00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:37.590
other people who are also
interested in a wide variety

182
00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:42.570
of different technology. And it
aims to create this really

183
00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:48.330
inclusive and really supportive environment
that, that takes away all

184
00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:50.340
of the other problems that
could get in the way

185
00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:53.220
of your learning, all of
the, the kind of that

186
00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:57.150
elite ism and this idea
of experts and, and that

187
00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:02.610
not everyone can learn XYZ
technology. Not everyone can learn

188
00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:06.660
functional programming or not. Everyone
is smart enough to learn

189
00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:10.980
Haskell. All of that just
goes away. When you create

190
00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:14.700
an environment where people are
just there to learn and

191
00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:17.310
to share what they're learning
and to help each other

192
00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:20.370
learn new things. And everything
is new to somebody at

193
00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:23.210
some point. So help me
paint a picture here, because

194
00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:25.790
I go to regress.com. One
of the first things that's

195
00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:29.810
on the homepage is it
says not a bootcamp and

196
00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:31.640
it goes through, and it
explains that it's not a

197
00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:34.040
boot camp. It's boot camps
are built on the same

198
00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:37.640
principles as traditional schools where
good teachers and willing students,

199
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:39.950
et cetera, et cetera, you
know, and talks about how

200
00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:42.350
it's more community driven, but
kind of, and it also

201
00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:45.050
says that it's not a
prep program. It's not preparing

202
00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:46.610
you for a job. You
know, you might get a

203
00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:48.920
great new job, but that's
not what it is. Help

204
00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:51.980
me understand, poking a little
bit. How is this not

205
00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:55.840
just hanging out with smart
people and hoping something good

206
00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:59.730
happens? Well, you know, to
a certain extent, and it's

207
00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:01.740
not necessarily hanging out with
smart people, but hanging out

208
00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:07.110
with interested and motivated people
who are from a wide

209
00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:11.310
range of backgrounds, wide range
of the technologies that they

210
00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:15.480
work with, just getting a
really diverse, but super enthusiastic

211
00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:18.300
group of people together in
one room can be, can

212
00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:21.450
have amazing effects. And so
part of it is part

213
00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:23.490
of the draw is that,
and the other part of

214
00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:27.090
the draw is that, you
know, how, how many times

215
00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:31.230
maybe does someone who's been
a professional developer working maybe

216
00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:33.180
with the same technology for,
I don't know, what 10

217
00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:35.850
years or something think, Oh,
wow. I would love to

218
00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:39.030
really explore, you know, this
new language over there. Or

219
00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:41.880
I would love to build
that, that app or that

220
00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:43.710
game that I've been thinking
about. I would love to

221
00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:47.670
get to know this open
source project, but I need

222
00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:51.780
time and space to sit
down. And other people kind

223
00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:54.390
of to motivate me to
sit down and actually do

224
00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:58.710
it. And so it's a
way to, yeah, it's, it's

225
00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:01.080
a retreat in that sense.
It's a way to kind

226
00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:05.790
of signal to yourself and
possibly to the other people

227
00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:07.410
in your life or the
other people around you that

228
00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:11.820
you right now are focused
on your own learning. And

229
00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:15.720
you're focused on, on leveling
up your skills, whatever that

230
00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:19.140
means to you, whether it's,
you know, working with a

231
00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:22.110
new language, whether it's building
something that you've never tried

232
00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:25.440
before, whether it's just pair
programming with people all day,

233
00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:28.230
because you have been working
by yourself for a while

234
00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:31.980
or whatever it means to
you, you know, reading papers,

235
00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:36.900
all kinds of different activities
that for different people have

236
00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:42.120
a really positive impact on
their learning. Sometimes just having

237
00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:45.330
the time and space to
dig into that is necessary.

238
00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:48.420
Yeah. Yeah. The structure, the
idea that you may have

239
00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:52.140
been programming for a year
or 10, but to sit

240
00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:55.650
down and hone your craft
for three months, like a

241
00:13:55.650 --> 00:13:58.350
writer's workshop, you know, you
want to be a better

242
00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:03.090
novelist from a, from a
coding perspective, which isn't something

243
00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:06.720
that necessarily years of practice
and years of working, isn't

244
00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:08.670
going to give you because
it's about sitting down and

245
00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:13.590
focusing on that and being
a better programmer at a

246
00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:16.260
really focusing on quality. So
this is not a coworking

247
00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.260
space. This is not a
bootcamp. You do have to

248
00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:22.290
have some amount of focus
like you have to, they're

249
00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:24.240
not going to make a
program for you. They're not

250
00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:26.910
going to be, but by
program, I mean build a

251
00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:30.270
curriculum, Right? There's no curriculum,
there's no courses, there's no

252
00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:33.870
teachers it's completely self directed.
So it is, you know,

253
00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:36.810
that's not for everybody. And
some people would be better

254
00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:38.760
off and would enjoy and
get more out of a

255
00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:43.980
bootcamp. Of course, you know,
but for people who are

256
00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:48.270
self motivated, who have, you
know, things that they're curious

257
00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:51.030
about, or maybe just want
exposure to new things that

258
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:53.510
didn't know existed and want
to be able to do

259
00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:56.030
that all in a, in
an environment where the focus

260
00:14:56.030 --> 00:15:01.460
is really on creating a
safe space for learning where

261
00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:06.110
nobody feels dumb, because they
didn't know something, nobody feels

262
00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:09.290
bad because someone is saying
that the technology that they

263
00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:13.550
know is inferior to some
other technology, removing all of

264
00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:17.000
those problems and just giving
people the space to kind

265
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.690
of flourish and do their
own thing is, is an

266
00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:24.260
amazing effect of this community,
of the Recurse center. I

267
00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.870
think they do a great
job of encouraging that. And,

268
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:29.060
you know, they have this,
the, the motto of the

269
00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:32.270
recur center is never graduate.
And this is really, the

270
00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:35.620
idea is that all of
us are constantly learning even

271
00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:40.280
exactly. And we are all
students, you know, even the

272
00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:46.130
world expert on, you know,
a particular language or the

273
00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:50.180
person who wrote the book
on a particular framework, even

274
00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:53.630
they have things to learn
and, you know, we can

275
00:15:53.630 --> 00:16:00.130
all help each other to,
to advance our horizons and,

276
00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:03.920
and come to grips with
new problems. And that makes

277
00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:07.490
a stronger tech community. It
makes us stronger individually. It

278
00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:10.430
makes us stronger as a
group, and they do a

279
00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:14.530
really great job of fostering
that community. Let me push

280
00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:17.620
back a little bit, then
not everyone's in New York, not

281
00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:20.740
everyone will be, has three
months. Not everyone has the

282
00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:25.330
money. How do we take
the concepts? The philosophy never

283
00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:30.430
graduate and, you know, always
be educating yourself, find time

284
00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:33.430
to be in your own
head and apply that to

285
00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:36.450
our listeners who are all
over the world and in

286
00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:39.490
various stages in their life.
Yeah, well there, I mean,

287
00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:42.400
there are a lot of
great online communities that also

288
00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:47.290
focus on similar, similar ideals
as it were, or similar

289
00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:52.570
guidelines. I personally enjoy, you
know, face to face contact

290
00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:53.920
a lot. So I find
myself at a lot of

291
00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:57.010
meetups and things like the
Recurse center or conferences, but

292
00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:00.340
a lot of folks get
much more out of, out

293
00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:03.340
of those kinds of interactions
online and finding, you know,

294
00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:07.450
Slack groups, Slack channels, where
they can find other people

295
00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:12.790
that are interested in the
same things, or want to

296
00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:17.170
explore the same new territory.
And so I think that

297
00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:20.140
there are a lot of,
a lot of communities doing

298
00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:25.630
that really well out there.
And I think, you know,

299
00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:27.910
your podcast is, is a
really good example of that

300
00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:30.760
as well. You talk to
so many people all over

301
00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:35.890
the world that are doing
amazing things and, and by

302
00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:38.920
bringing them all together in
one place for people to,

303
00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:42.190
to find out and kind
of make perhaps a first

304
00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:46.210
encounter with those new projects,
those new technologies, there are

305
00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:48.940
so many great projects like
that, that, that aim to

306
00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:53.250
of collect all those amazing
ideas in places digitally where

307
00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:56.250
people can find them, you
know, on their own time.

308
00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:00.950
Yeah. I think that there's,
there's definitely people who feel

309
00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:06.470
alone in tech and there
it's overwhelming to know where

310
00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:08.960
to go, where to find
a community, to know if

311
00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:11.600
that community is a safe
space or not, whether there'll

312
00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:14.840
be welcome in that community.
And whether that's really to

313
00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:17.330
be a little cliche, the
community that's going to feed

314
00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:21.320
their spirit, you know, if
it's going to give them

315
00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:24.050
what they need to move
forward, because I know that

316
00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:27.770
technology can be very, very
lonely to am. You've Googled

317
00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:31.850
for the question you found
yourself asking the question and

318
00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:35.240
no answers, you know, you've
Googled so much that you've

319
00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:36.950
found the end of the
internet gone back to your

320
00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:39.080
own blog, where you asked
the question and now you're

321
00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:42.140
alone entirely, and the, you
just need another set of

322
00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:45.710
eyes. Yeah, absolutely. And that's
where, you know, I think

323
00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:51.320
these, the, the, the amazing
communities that grow out of

324
00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:56.510
local meetups that grow out
of programs like the Recurse

325
00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:58.490
center or places like the
Recurse center, where, you know,

326
00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:00.050
people go there for a
few months, but then they

327
00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:02.420
go back home to the,
all over the world. And

328
00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:07.220
they kind of bring that,
that way of, of creating

329
00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:11.090
a safe learning space to
the people that they interact

330
00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:13.910
with on a, on a
one to one level, that's

331
00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:16.430
something, you know, I try
and aspire to do in

332
00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:20.390
my interactions with people in
my local communities. And I

333
00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:23.990
think a lot of folks
that have recognized that this

334
00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:26.780
is a good way to
go about doing technology. It's

335
00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:29.960
more fun when we do
it together. I see that

336
00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:33.350
happening all over the place
on an individual level. I

337
00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:36.320
see a lot of conferences,
you know, that are, that

338
00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:38.930
come out of, kind of
spin off of local meetups

339
00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:42.560
and try to bring, bring
the tech world to the

340
00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:47.240
local community. Instead of making
people go travel abroad to

341
00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:51.620
find the people, to have
those conversations with. So hopefully

342
00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:56.420
as, you know, as more
and more people talk about

343
00:19:56.420 --> 00:20:00.200
this, these issues about how
isolating tech can feel about

344
00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:04.130
how terrible it can feel
when you think you are

345
00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:07.370
alone in banging your head
against your computer all night

346
00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:10.640
and how great it can
feel when you find someone

347
00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:15.290
else to, to grapple with
that with you. I think

348
00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:17.860
as, as more of those
conversations take place, hopefully in

349
00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:22.970
places like this on your,
on your podcast, we'll see

350
00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:28.670
even more communities spring up
that really try to counteract

351
00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:32.510
that isolation. So what have
you done in the last

352
00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:34.850
few years as you've had
your, you did your three

353
00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:39.050
months at the Recurse center,
did your hacker school, and

354
00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:41.630
you did, you contributed to
open source projects. You worked

355
00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:47.060
on even the HTML standard
contribution. There is still every

356
00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:49.660
contribution matters. What has been
your area of study and

357
00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:52.380
interest in the last few
years? So one of the

358
00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:55.260
things that I got really
interested in at the Recurse

359
00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:58.860
center in addition to functional
programming and kind of exploring

360
00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:06.120
different programming paradigms is exploring
different languages and language programming,

361
00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:11.670
language design, how languages are
implemented, the differences between them,

362
00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:14.610
the kind of ecosystem of
languages out there. You know,

363
00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:18.690
when I, when I started
coding, I was, I worked

364
00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:20.730
in a couple of different
languages, but I wasn't really

365
00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:25.140
aware of just how many
different, completely different types of

366
00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:27.930
languages there are out there.
And I find that diversity

367
00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:34.080
of, you know, options really
exciting because for any given

368
00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:38.760
problem, you know, there is
probably a language out there

369
00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:40.980
that you don't know that
could solve it better than

370
00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:43.950
the, the one language that
you've been trying to, you

371
00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:47.280
know, throw it every problem.
So I've got really interested

372
00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:52.290
in, in programming languages. I
started exploring different ones, and

373
00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:56.700
I'm always interested in learning
new languages, whether programming languages

374
00:21:56.700 --> 00:22:02.280
or human languages. And so
ultimately in my, in my

375
00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:07.920
kind of exploration of that,
I somehow ended up at

376
00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:09.900
a company called Uber research,
which is where I work

377
00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:13.950
now as a software developer.
And I work on building

378
00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:18.360
our own domain specific language,
a custom query language to

379
00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:25.440
interface with our data on
science research funding, basically. Yeah,

380
00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:28.740
the funding aspect of, of
how science gets done, where

381
00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:33.960
the money comes from, where
it goes to what publications

382
00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:37.860
and patents and things like
that come out of it.

383
00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:43.740
And at Uber research, we
are building a prototype query

384
00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:49.410
language, our own to make
interacting with that data as

385
00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:53.700
easy and painless and straightforward
as possible. And so this

386
00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:57.690
is a, this is a
problem area that I, I

387
00:22:57.690 --> 00:23:00.750
find really interesting how to,
you know, treating languages as

388
00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:03.360
interfaces and kind of how
to do that, that interface

389
00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:08.160
design, where we're not talking
about buttons on, on a

390
00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:11.430
web site or something like
that, something that's visual, but

391
00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:16.140
rather we're talking about how
the language allows you to

392
00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:22.080
compose pieces of text that
explain or express what it

393
00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:24.660
is you want to do.
And that's kind of what

394
00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:26.670
we all, what we all
deal with every day as

395
00:23:26.730 --> 00:23:30.540
developers. And I find that
a really interesting, really interesting

396
00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:34.290
problem. Let me ask a
couple of questions from, from

397
00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:37.170
my, from my ignorance perspective,
from the PR perspective, my

398
00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:40.050
own ignorance, and kind of
maybe ask some kind of

399
00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:43.320
like surgical questions to get
my head around this. When

400
00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:47.090
does one know that it's
to make another language versus

401
00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:51.110
using an existing one, because
you look at different languages,

402
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:53.240
whether it be a toy
language that someone did made,

403
00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:57.020
like, for example, you made
a toy language called Kimi

404
00:23:57.430 --> 00:24:00.880
Kimmy. Yeah. Keep it minimal.
Yeah. But when I look

405
00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:03.340
at it and again, no
disrespect and kind of just

406
00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:07.300
speaking from my own ignorance,
it looks enough like lisp

407
00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:09.790
that it looks like it's
lisp. It is a list.

408
00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:12.550
Yeah, absolutely. So I made
Kimmy at the Recurse center,

409
00:24:12.550 --> 00:24:18.130
I'm at just as a
toy language to teach myself

410
00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:24.250
about how interpreters work I
had never really dug into

411
00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:29.170
that question before. I had
never really dug under the,

412
00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:31.500
under the surface of, you
know, what is an interpreter?

413
00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:33.820
What does it do? How
does it work? So I

414
00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:36.700
think, you know, if you're
curious about the internals of

415
00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:39.400
a programming language, it's time
to build a programming language

416
00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:42.700
for yourself. If for no
one else, a couple of

417
00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:46.150
people have found that project
helpful as they also learned

418
00:24:46.150 --> 00:24:49.510
about, about languages. I never
intended it to be used,

419
00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:54.340
you know, in, in any
kind of productive way, neither

420
00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:57.700
by myself, nor by anyone
else. But for me, it

421
00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:03.310
was an incredibly educational project
and it really helped me

422
00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:10.690
kind of grow my interest
in language implementation and how

423
00:25:11.290 --> 00:25:13.150
all the different, all the
different decisions you need to

424
00:25:13.150 --> 00:25:14.590
make there and all the
different ways it can be

425
00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:17.830
done. What would you tell
people who might look at

426
00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:21.790
that though and say, it's
so overwhelming. And also what

427
00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:23.320
is it going to be
used for someone might be

428
00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:26.500
listening and say, you know,
I've got toy projects sitting

429
00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:28.960
in my, in my local
machine, but I don't want

430
00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:30.790
to put it on GitHub
because people might look at

431
00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:33.580
it and say that it
sucks, but at the same

432
00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:36.610
time, it's not something that's
going to be a product

433
00:25:36.610 --> 00:25:40.330
or project. It is literally
a learning exercise. Why should

434
00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:42.280
I put my learning exercise
out there? Cause I guess

435
00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:44.620
I'm wanting to know how
you would encourage one or

436
00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:46.840
tell them that they should
in fact put their experiment

437
00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:50.560
or their toy out there.
I think, you know, if

438
00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:52.660
people are comfortable, they absolutely
should. I think, I think

439
00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:54.700
you, what you just said
touches on a couple of

440
00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:57.310
issues. First of all, you
mentioned, you know, maybe they're

441
00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:59.380
nervous about putting it on
GitHub because they think people

442
00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:01.780
are gonna say, Oh, this
sucks. We need to stop

443
00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:05.800
doing that. As, as a
collective, you know, community, we

444
00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:08.290
need to stop telling other
people that the thing that

445
00:26:08.290 --> 00:26:12.790
they built out of interest
and curiosity sucks because I

446
00:26:12.790 --> 00:26:16.090
don't know because someone who
had more time, maybe more

447
00:26:16.090 --> 00:26:21.640
experience, maybe more funding, exactly
whatever other resources sat down

448
00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:24.580
and made something that perhaps
has fewer bugs or perhaps

449
00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:28.360
can handle some other problem
better. That's not the point.

450
00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:31.450
We are all just here
building cool things and we

451
00:26:31.450 --> 00:26:34.180
should be celebrating each other
for that instead of tearing

452
00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:38.110
each other down. So that's
one thing I think that

453
00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:40.540
we all need to do
to make it a safer

454
00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:43.320
space, to just share what
you've learned and think the

455
00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:46.380
reason that I feel it's
important for other people to

456
00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:49.170
share what they have been
learning and the cool toy

457
00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:51.840
projects that they've been doing
just to explore new technologies

458
00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:56.250
is because then if you
haven't yet to made that

459
00:26:56.250 --> 00:27:00.930
first exploration and you see
someone else's introductory forays, you

460
00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:05.050
know, first testing the waters
of a new technology and

461
00:27:05.050 --> 00:27:09.570
you, you can more easily
see yourself getting into that

462
00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:12.690
new technology. You can see
a pathway from where you

463
00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:16.290
are now not having the
first clue about whether it

464
00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:19.500
be VR. For example, I
was just sitting today at

465
00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:23.370
the Mozilla, all hands meeting
in a session about building

466
00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:27.750
VR experiences with a frame,
having not the first idea

467
00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:30.480
of how to do that
and watching one of my

468
00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:36.030
fellow MAs tech speakers walk
us through the most basic

469
00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:39.840
hello world VR app, you
can say, Oh, okay. That's

470
00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:43.440
not something that only experts
in VR technology can do.

471
00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:46.080
That's something that I could
start doing right now. And

472
00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:47.940
you can see that pathway
and then you build your

473
00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:50.100
HelloWorld app. And then you
say, okay, I want to

474
00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:51.810
get a little more ambitious
and you build the next

475
00:27:51.810 --> 00:27:53.460
thing. And the next thing,
and who knows, you know,

476
00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:58.080
fast forward that person who
just saw your toy project

477
00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:01.050
on GitHub, that could have
been the first step in

478
00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:05.580
them doing the next really
amazing kind of quantum leap

479
00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:09.180
in that type of technology.
You never know, but I

480
00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:14.940
think showing those people, the
path into a new area

481
00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:18.120
is really important. And the
more we can all do

482
00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:20.340
that, I think the better
off we're all going to

483
00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:23.790
be as an industry, as
a community, as individuals. And

484
00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:25.320
I think that also goes
back to, you know, the

485
00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:27.900
talk, the talk I gave
at JS on which we

486
00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:29.910
were talking about earlier. I
think that's one of the

487
00:28:29.910 --> 00:28:31.710
reasons that people like that
as they can see a

488
00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:37.980
path for themselves into this
mystical dark world of magical

489
00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:42.120
functional programming. Whereas when they
just see talks by, you

490
00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:48.030
know, PhDs on, on, on
category theory or whatever, it's

491
00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:49.530
a, it's not so clear
to see how to get

492
00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:51.980
started. Okay. Now you just
gave me something to go

493
00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:55.000
on Google. Cause I don't
know what category theories that

494
00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.950
you want me to tell
me, Maybe us just talking

495
00:28:57.950 --> 00:28:59.750
about it right now. You're
going to go, you know,

496
00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:02.630
fast forward a few years,
Scott Hanselman becomes the world's

497
00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:07.490
foremost expert in category there.
You never know, You know

498
00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:11.120
what true story, just as
you're saying this, it made

499
00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:13.970
me realize that even though
I think people may meet

500
00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:15.500
in may know this about
me, that even though I've

501
00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:20.360
been writing software as a
business for since 1992, so

502
00:29:20.390 --> 00:29:26.630
25 years, I didn't graduate
from college until 2003. And

503
00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:29.030
for one of my projects
in my junior, I want

504
00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:31.760
to say my junior year
I wrote a tiny O

505
00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:34.670
S in C sharp. This
is in 2000, it was

506
00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:39.770
July of 2000 and no
may of 2002. And this

507
00:29:39.770 --> 00:29:42.040
is before GitHub. This is
before get, I think I

508
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:45.970
have a zip file of
this thing. And 12 years

509
00:29:45.970 --> 00:29:49.600
ago I looked at it
and was like personally offended

510
00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:55.120
by looking at the code.
So now we are 15

511
00:29:55.150 --> 00:29:58.240
years away from this code.
I'm going to see if

512
00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:00.790
it still runs and if
I can port it to

513
00:30:00.790 --> 00:30:02.770
modern C-sharp and I want
to put it on get

514
00:30:02.770 --> 00:30:08.260
hub. So I can lean
into this code 15 years

515
00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:10.660
old. So, because you said,
so I'm going to put

516
00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:15.490
this horrible, horrible thing online,
and maybe someone will have

517
00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:18.340
a kick looking at it
because I know that it

518
00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:20.080
compiled once and it did
get me out of the

519
00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:23.680
class. So I did pass
operating systems three, three 12,

520
00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:27.120
because of his project. Well,
there you go. It already

521
00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:29.220
served more than, you know,
more than enough purpose to

522
00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:32.400
justify its existence. But I
think that, that, that, that's

523
00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:35.850
another thing about when people
put their, you know, experiments

524
00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:40.110
and their little tests up
on GitHub or whatever, whatever

525
00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:42.120
place in public where people
can find it. It's also,

526
00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:44.730
it's kind of like a,
you know, a journal and

527
00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:47.430
you can see, you can
see progress. I mean, I

528
00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:50.490
also have those kinds of
that reaction of, Oh God,

529
00:30:50.490 --> 00:30:52.020
I can't believe this code
when I go back and

530
00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:54.870
look at old things, but
that's because I've, I've had

531
00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:56.370
a journey, you know? And
there was a time when

532
00:30:56.370 --> 00:30:59.670
I was really excited that
I pressed buttons on my

533
00:30:59.670 --> 00:31:03.000
computer and then it did
the thing I wanted. Even

534
00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.340
if the code wasn't elegant,
even if it wasn't, you

535
00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:09.300
know, following best practices, let's
say maybe it wasn't very

536
00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:12.070
reusable, but it did the
thing I wanted. And, and

537
00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:16.170
I was excited by that.
And now I'm maybe excited

538
00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:20.310
by slightly different things where,
you know, I get excited

539
00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:22.740
about, Oh, well I found
a cool way to test

540
00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:26.220
this part of my code
or something like that. But

541
00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:27.960
if we put all of
that in the open, if

542
00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:31.560
we all kind of talk
about those, those little experiments

543
00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:33.750
and those things that get
us excited, then other people

544
00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:36.810
can see. Wow. All right.
You know, they, weren't always

545
00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:42.660
completely fluent in technology ex
they started somewhere just like

546
00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:46.020
I'm starting somewhere. Yeah. Well,
I appreciate that. And I

547
00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:48.390
appreciate you and for coming
on the show today. Oh,

548
00:31:48.390 --> 00:31:50.280
well, thank you so much
for having me. It's it's

549
00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:53.430
been great chatting with you.
I'm going to go ahead

550
00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:55.410
and add everything that we
talked about to the show

551
00:31:55.410 --> 00:31:58.260
notes, and I would encourage
everyone to check out you're

552
00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:02.430
on. Jenna's fantastic. Talk on
functional programming JavaScript, which if

553
00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:05.850
I understand correctly was not
only spontaneous, it was your

554
00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:08.880
first public tech talk. Is
that correct? Yeah, it was,

555
00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:11.160
it was my first talk
at a, at a software

556
00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:14.520
conference. Yeah. Now you're flying
all over doing tech talks

557
00:32:14.550 --> 00:32:18.360
so who can do this
kind of thing. Yeah, exactly.

558
00:32:18.390 --> 00:32:22.020
Everyone has something interesting to
say. And so I think

559
00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:24.570
that, you know, the more
people we see at places

560
00:32:24.570 --> 00:32:27.570
like conferences and on podcasts
and on GitHub kind of

561
00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:33.750
sharing their journeys and their
stories and their experience it

562
00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:37.020
the better off, we're all
gonna be. Fantastic. Thank you

563
00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:40.830
so much. Thank you. This
has been another episode of

564
00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:43.200
Hansel minutes and we'll see
you again next week.
