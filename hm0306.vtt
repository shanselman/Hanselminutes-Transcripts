episode, Scott talks with zoo

7
00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:49.950
city author Lauren. BUCAs about
creating science fiction. Hi, this

8
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.690
is Scott Hanselman and this
is another episode of Hansel

9
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.720
minutes and I'm here and
beautiful Wellington New Zealand at the

10
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.060
Webstock. And I have the
absolute pleasure of sitting down

11
00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:02.340
with Lauren BUCAs, who is
the 2011 Arthur C. Clark winner for

12
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.110
her novel Zhou city. Also,
you wrote Moxie land. That's

13
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.740
right. And you've working on
another book right now. I'm

14
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.720
working on a book about
a time traveling serial killer

15
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.870
called the shining girls. That'll
be out in 2013. Oh,

16
00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:16.570
that's brilliant. Okay. So we
have to talk about that

17
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.100
in time travel and both
folks who listened to the

18
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.410
podcast or read my blog,
know that I'm really into

19
00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.110
science fiction and I've been
going through a scifi on

20
00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.110
my Kindle at just a
ridiculous pace. I'm actually about

21
00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.270
halfway through zoo city right
now, and I've fallen asleep

22
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.700
with a book on my
face, the digital book on

23
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.220
my face, a couple of
different times. I wanted to

24
00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.890
talk to you about process
because I think that's interesting

25
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.960
too, to the listeners. And
it's always interesting to me

26
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.740
that we, as the non
science fiction writers have a

27
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.960
perspective about what it's like,
you know, I assume it's

28
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.180
this kind of amazing romantic
thing where you're like in

29
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.360
a cafe in a wonderful
foreign country, you live in

30
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.930
Cape town, South Africa, and the
words just kind of flow.

31
00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.720
You know, you're typing on
like an old timey typewriter,

32
00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.240
and then you rip off
the manuscript. You only have

33
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.700
one copy of, and you
turn it in. Basically I

34
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.220
sit at a hotel pool
and kind of lounge with

35
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.940
cocktails and kind of type
one handed. Well, you know,

36
00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.990
looking fantastic in my bikini.
No, it's it's hell on

37
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.440
earth. It's, you know, it's
a, it sounds terrible. And

38
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.440
I know that there are
much more difficult occupations and

39
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.990
much more labor intensive occupations,
but it is very lonely

40
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.720
work. You're locked inside your
head all day making stuff

41
00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.800
up. So I actually rent
a studio space so that

42
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.750
I can have other people
around and I'm not working

43
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.420
from home. And I spend
a lot of my time

44
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.380
avoiding writing, which is ridiculous
because it's a privilege to

45
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.580
get paid, to make up
stories. It's amazing, but there's

46
00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.380
a lot of kind of
wasting time on the internet.

47
00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.120
You'll see if you follow
me on Twitter that I

48
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.010
spend kind of the first
two hours of the day

49
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.750
messing around on the internet.
And then I kind of

50
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.290
go quiet. And that's when
I'm, I'm actually settling down

51
00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.390
to work. And it's basically
up until the point that

52
00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.640
I have to force myself
to do it, that I

53
00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.500
can't avoid it anymore, that
I actually have to knuckle

54
00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.220
down and actually do some
do work. Now, does it

55
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.040
feel like work? It does
feel like work. I think

56
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.290
it's because I've been doing
it as work for a,

57
00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.300
you know, I've been a
professional writer in some capacity,

58
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.540
either as a journalist or
a TV script writer for

59
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:16.360
the last wow. Since 1997.
So, so putting words down

60
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.840
on paper is work and
it is also a joy

61
00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.120
and it's tremendously exciting as
soon as I'm into it,

62
00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.340
you know, within the first
20 minutes, I'm having a

63
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.530
fantastic time and that's wonderful,
but I will, I will

64
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.530
avoid getting there. And it's
quite a perverse and twisted

65
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.080
thing to do to yourself
to avoid doing something that

66
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.410
you love that you've always
wanted to do. I think

67
00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.040
it's just human nature Is
that, I mean procrastination by

68
00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.710
its nature. It's just what
we do. Yeah. Do you

69
00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:44.310
do any take techniques to
like, like the Pomodoro technique

70
00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.780
where you set a timer
and you're like, okay, I'm

71
00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.820
going to sprint for 30
minutes and then give myself

72
00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.530
a gift at the end
of it. I've been, I've

73
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.080
been doing more kind of,
of the Pomodoro sprinting stuff,

74
00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.850
but mainly I use freedom
Mac freedom, which is fantastic.

75
00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.450
It just locks you out
of the internet because I

76
00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.490
don't always have that willpower,
but I am trying to

77
00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.380
build in more reward systems.
And I think, you know,

78
00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.050
the most important thing for
me is to not just

79
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.330
be locked in my head
a few years ago, I

80
00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.730
got a grant from the
national arts council in South Africa

81
00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.580
to write Marcy land, my
first novel. And I locked

82
00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.110
myself in the house and
I wouldn't let myself out

83
00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:17.580
of the house until I
had a thousand words down

84
00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:21.690
on paper. And what happened
was that I just had

85
00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.000
no stimulation and I just
kind of shut down. I

86
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.470
didn't know how to talk
to people anymore. And I

87
00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.860
know that sounds overdramatic, but
I would go out and

88
00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:33.510
I would struggle to initiate
chit chat. And it was

89
00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.820
very frustrating and it was
very alienating and you absolutely

90
00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.640
should not do that. So
that idea of the writer

91
00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.830
who has become like so
involved in their own world

92
00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.430
and their own, their own
minds, that they've lost the

93
00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.880
ability to speak. It sounds
like classic writer, that's like

94
00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.100
such a cliche, but you're
saying it actually does happen.

95
00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.130
It definitely. It definitely happened
to me during that specific

96
00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.170
period. So what I've learned
is that I need a

97
00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.090
space where there are other
people around. I can still

98
00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.010
retreat into my own world.
I put on my headphones,

99
00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.230
I play my music and
that's fine, but I can

100
00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:02.910
go make a cup of
coffee. I can turn around

101
00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.210
and somebody can show me
a funny YouTube video and,

102
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.920
you know, just, just be
able to be in the

103
00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.710
world and have people around.
The other thing is, you

104
00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.420
know, I was a journalist
for a very long time

105
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.250
and being out in the
world, interviewing people, it's like

106
00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.280
a backstage pass to society.
So you really get a

107
00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.340
sense of what is happening
around you. And you're not

108
00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.180
just stuck in your cozy
little enclave. And I think

109
00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.340
that's really important. I think
it's really important for writers

110
00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:30.990
to be social, to be
out in the world to

111
00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.450
have experiences. And I'm not
saying you need to go

112
00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:36.780
to the full Hunter S
Thompson route, but you need

113
00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.840
to understand people. You need
to be an observer. How

114
00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.090
often does going out into
the world and sitting at

115
00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.000
a cafe or walking in
the mall, give you that

116
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.070
inspiration, that you then rush
back and like you see

117
00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:49.440
someone wearing something or their
hair is a certain way,

118
00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.360
or they do something, you
see an interaction. And then

119
00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.760
that ends up in the
book. You know, I, I

120
00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.470
file that stuff. I don't
run away and write it

121
00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:59.120
down immediately. You know, I'm,
I'm absorbing stuff all the

122
00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.120
time. I'm probably stealing bits
of your personality right now.

123
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.750
You'll see it rock up
five years from now. Yeah.

124
00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:08.150
It's, it's not, it's not
an instant run home and

125
00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.620
write it down. It's just
kind of observing constantly and

126
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:12.320
trying to find stuff. But
one of the things I

127
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.820
do like to do when
I'm writing a book is

128
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.920
to go on, on Iraqi,
you know, to go and

129
00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:21.650
visit the locations. And I
find that that reality is,

130
00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:24.470
is much richer than anything
you could make up. And

131
00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:26.360
I think you can see
that novelists who do their

132
00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.610
research, who've actually been to
places and you, can you

133
00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.880
get such a sense of
where this is and that

134
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.890
they've actually been, then that
they have a real understanding

135
00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:36.170
of this and that they're,
I think it's the surprising

136
00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:41.090
details. And those little nuances,
I think, are really important

137
00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:43.030
for me in my writing
process. How much of that

138
00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:45.820
is absorption and versus how
much of it is. Note-taking

139
00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:48.460
like, if you're going to
go to a township or

140
00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:51.250
you're gonna go off into
the mountains, are you sitting

141
00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:53.410
there with a sketchpad and
writing stuff down? Or do

142
00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:55.600
you literally just let it
come in by osmosis and

143
00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.970
hope that you'll remember it?
It's a bit of both.

144
00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:00.700
If I'm, if I'm on
a Reiki, then I'm taking

145
00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:05.020
notes obsessively. Tell me that
word again. Explain that Iraqi

146
00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:09.610
reconnaissance mission. Oh, okay. Yeah.
Sorry. It's terrible. Militaristic term.

147
00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:12.430
I thought it was some
kind of amazing South African

148
00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:16.390
word. I didn't No, no.
I think it's me being

149
00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:21.670
pretentious. The, the book that
you're working on now, you

150
00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:24.010
said as a time travel
book, and I've been just

151
00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:27.310
for some reason, devouring time
travel lately and all the

152
00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:30.490
things that time travel books
have in common, I think

153
00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:34.930
successful time travel books is
that they're hard. They ask

154
00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:37.140
something of the list of
the, of the reader. They,

155
00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:39.490
they, they assume that you're
not an idiot. Very few

156
00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:42.700
other than maybe back to
the future. No, no time

157
00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:46.180
travel story assumes that the
reader is an idiot and

158
00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:49.960
they always make it one
level deeper than maybe it

159
00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.150
would be right that way
you get to argue about

160
00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:53.920
it. Like, no, no, no.
The wife came back and

161
00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:56.110
then the people, and that
was in the same time

162
00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:59.890
it was his grandfather or
whatever. Right. I'm sure that

163
00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:02.650
when they were pitching like
the movie inception, they were

164
00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:05.080
like, this is way too
complicated. And they're like, no,

165
00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:08.740
no trust the audience that
they're smart. Right. When you're

166
00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:10.690
doing that, though, that means
that I'm having to thank

167
00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:13.210
you as the author to
make it self-consistent must be

168
00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:16.030
doing a lot of work.
Where are you keeping all

169
00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:19.900
of this straight? Is it
Vizio diagrams? Are you drawing

170
00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:23.230
on the wall and marker.
I've got a lot of

171
00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:25.090
notes in the novel and
I don't want to talk

172
00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:28.480
too much about it because
I'm vaguely superstitious that not

173
00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:31.270
another GenX has it, but
that it takes away the

174
00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:34.090
energy. Well, let's talk about
the general concept of time

175
00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:36.190
travel books that you've maybe,
Well, no. So what I

176
00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:38.650
do with, with my research
and with keeping my timelines

177
00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:40.660
in track is I have
three different timelines. You know,

178
00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:42.910
it's about time traveling, serial
killers. So I've got his

179
00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:47.110
timeline, which is out of
order. There is the actual

180
00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:51.520
historical timeline, and then there's
the book's timeline. And I

181
00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.830
have three different timelines up
on my wall with different

182
00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:57.690
note cards. And I've got
very information on there. He

183
00:08:57.690 --> 00:08:59.760
leaves anachronistic clues on the
body. So I've got to

184
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.550
also track which clue has
gone, where at one point

185
00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:04.410
he's injured, I've got to
make sure that he's injured

186
00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:07.830
in the correct scenes. So
it's, it's a hell of

187
00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:11.370
a thing. And it is,
it's this very visual map

188
00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:14.640
that I've gotten kind of
scrolled across my wall. Yeah.

189
00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:16.770
Which is also difficult now
that I'm actually away from

190
00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:18.450
my office in my home.
And I don't have that

191
00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:20.040
map to just be able
to glance up and look

192
00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:24.330
at. So yeah, I have
to, I've had it delivered

193
00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:28.510
in may And did, how
does, so that's interesting that

194
00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.590
you, you were concerned that
maybe talking about it too

195
00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:32.870
much and we won't would
take away the creative energy,

196
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:35.420
but the fact that there's
a looming deadline, doesn't take

197
00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:38.300
away the creative energy. I
find I work best with

198
00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:40.040
a deadline. It's also, it
comes from being a freelance

199
00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:42.320
journalist for so long. You
know, you put the most

200
00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:44.840
urgent work at the front
and everything else kind of

201
00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:46.640
falls by the wayside, which
is why it took me

202
00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.320
four years to write my
first novel because I was

203
00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:52.490
messing around. I didn't have
a very hard deadline. And

204
00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:54.590
eventually the only, the only
reason I finished my salon,

205
00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:58.160
this is a terrible confession
is that I was going

206
00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.750
to get kicked out of
the MFA in creative writing

207
00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:02.030
program. If I didn't, they
basically said to me, look,

208
00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:04.730
you either deliver this book
or you're out. And, and

209
00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:06.020
I did it and I
pulled it out and it

210
00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:07.520
was easy, you know, as
soon as I had a

211
00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:10.040
hard deadline and, and then
I wrote Sioux city in

212
00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:11.810
a year because I, again,
I had a hard deadline,

213
00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:14.360
I got a two book
deal and it was great.

214
00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:16.370
So I like having a
deadline because it makes it

215
00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:20.090
creative work instead of art.
And of course there's art

216
00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:22.250
involved. And I'm not saying
that I'm not trying to

217
00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:25.040
make the best possible book,
but it's that whole factor

218
00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:28.040
of, Oh, the muse is
not with me today. I

219
00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:30.380
just can't do it as
opposed to, Oh God, I've

220
00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:32.480
got a deadline breathing down
my neck with lawyers attached

221
00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.010
on the other end. I
better sit down and do

222
00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:37.190
this. And you know, if
it's what I've done every

223
00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:39.860
day, I write every day
as a journalist or as

224
00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:41.300
a TV script writer. And
I've had to meet the

225
00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:43.970
deadlines and it's no different
with a novel In, in

226
00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:47.180
software, we have hard deadlines
and we're, there's the old

227
00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:51.200
software joke where you can
have it. Was it good,

228
00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:55.670
cheap or fast pick two?
It doesn't the same thing

229
00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:57.290
apply in writing. Like, do
you ever, do you ever

230
00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:59.150
read your other stuff? Like
with code, at least I

231
00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:00.980
can refactor it and I
can always mess with it

232
00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:02.930
and tinker, but you ever
go back and like, look

233
00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:04.550
at Moxie Len and go,
Oh, what was I chapter

234
00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:06.740
four? I should have, Oh,
it's too late. So I

235
00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:10.610
published it. There's no revision,
there's no version two. Do

236
00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:12.530
writers do that? Or is
that Just do that? I'd

237
00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:14.720
like, you know, a lot
of writers have big issues

238
00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.940
where they don't want to
deliver it all. You know,

239
00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:18.290
they're like, well, it's not
finished and they want to

240
00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:20.810
just keep polishing forever. And
I think that's also a

241
00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:23.150
level of insecurity that it's,
it's very scary to let

242
00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:25.010
something out into the world
and see how people react

243
00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:27.050
to it. And of course
there are things that I

244
00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:29.990
would go back and tweak
now if I could, but

245
00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:32.390
generally I'm, I'm happy with
them. And, and I kind

246
00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:34.970
of, I like to move
on and just move on

247
00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:36.950
to kind of the next
project and tell a whole

248
00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:40.150
different story. I'm also not,
I might consider SQL disease

249
00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:42.740
city, but I'm done with
most land and I just

250
00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:45.800
don't want to go back
there. So that universe is

251
00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:49.040
well, that, that particular, even
the universe, I mean, I

252
00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:53.030
was trying to do something
very specific there, but it's

253
00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.780
yeah. I told the story
that I wanted to tell

254
00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:58.420
within that. And I think
I'm always going to jump

255
00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:01.300
genres. I'm always going to
tell a different kind of

256
00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:03.970
story, the novel I want
to write after this is

257
00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:06.190
about dreams. And the one
I want to ride off

258
00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:08.710
to that is about the
real life alcohol crimes unit

259
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:11.280
in South Africa, Seriously planning that
far ahead. They can know

260
00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:13.320
you have a sense of
where you're heading. It's not,

261
00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:15.510
it's not so much, you
know, like, Oh, I've got

262
00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:17.910
my 10 year life plan
and everything's worked out it's

263
00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:19.920
that these are the stories
that are nagging at me.

264
00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:23.850
I think of stories is
kind of developing in the

265
00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:26.160
doc room in the back
of my head. And it's

266
00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.410
only once I actually start
putting it, you know, I've

267
00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:30.840
got kind of the negative,
but it's only when I

268
00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:33.360
start kind of putting it
through the chemical treatment that

269
00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.670
I start to really see
what I've got and really

270
00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:37.200
kind of have to work
at it to develop it.

271
00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:39.810
Is, is it a sense
that there's a story in

272
00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:41.430
you, it needs to get
out or is there a

273
00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:43.020
sense that there's a story
out there and you need

274
00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:45.750
to follow it until it
reaches? Its, I think it's

275
00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:47.370
a story that's in me
that needs to get out.

276
00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:49.140
And I always know my
beginnings and I always know

277
00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:51.900
my endings. It's the middle
bits that you have to

278
00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:55.080
fill in. There was a
great analogy and I don't

279
00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:56.940
know whose analogy it was,
but it's awesome. And I've

280
00:12:56.940 --> 00:13:01.740
stolen it, which is that
writing is like taking for

281
00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:03.930
me, writing is like taking
a road trip at night,

282
00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:06.390
you know, where you're leaving
from, you know, your ultimate

283
00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:08.520
destination, maybe, you know, some
of the major way points

284
00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:10.770
along the way, the rest
of the time you're driving

285
00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:12.420
in darkness, you can see
20 feet ahead of you

286
00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:13.890
in the headlights and you've
got to figure it out.

287
00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:16.530
And that's really how I
write. I know, I know

288
00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:18.510
the major plot points. I
know exactly how it's going

289
00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:20.970
to end. And there's a
lot of kind of freewheeling

290
00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:24.150
taking interesting detours books, never
turn out exactly the way

291
00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:27.150
I intended and usually they're
much better for that. And

292
00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:28.800
then I can just recycle
the ideas that I didn't

293
00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:33.420
use. That's a, that seems
like very, very kind of

294
00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:36.030
big picture and very high
level. How do you, do

295
00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:39.360
you agonize over individual phrases
and sentences? Cause Y I

296
00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.360
know that when I was
doing creative writing in school

297
00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:45.750
and I was not good
at it, that I would

298
00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:47.490
just look at a sentence
and I would get all

299
00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:50.220
wrapped up in the common
faults in the M dashes

300
00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:52.440
in the sense and just
how did it flow? And

301
00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:54.630
it didn't seem authentic. And
then I would go and

302
00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:58.680
look at other writing that
just is so soluble and

303
00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:01.470
it just kind of the
conversations go back and forth.

304
00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:04.770
And how do you, is
it having an ma and

305
00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:07.230
a fine arts and writing
that, that, that allows you

306
00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:09.900
to kind of get past
the little details of how

307
00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:13.020
to phrase something. I think
it's 10 years of journalism

308
00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:16.050
and writing everyday for a
living. I think the best

309
00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:17.250
thing you can do, if
you want to be a

310
00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:19.050
writer is try and get
a day job where you

311
00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:21.990
can write and hone your
craft. It's like being, it's

312
00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:23.700
that being a pro athlete
or a pianist or a

313
00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:25.620
Coda, you know, you actually
have to do it every

314
00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:29.560
day and just keep honing
and keep practicing. And that,

315
00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:31.620
that's how you get really,
really good. And of course,

316
00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:35.700
so clumsy moments and horrible
sentences and, and, and that's

317
00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:37.680
what editing is for, and
that's what editors are for.

318
00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:40.770
And, and they will deal
with the M dashes and

319
00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:43.890
the fact that I sometimes,
you know, cross into pluperfect

320
00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:48.750
when it's, yeah, I think
what's interesting for me is

321
00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:50.430
that there are certain parts
of the writing that I

322
00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:54.230
have to work at more,
which don't come naturally. Dialogue

323
00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.660
comes very naturally to me.
And often my first draft

324
00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:58.910
is very dialogue heavy. And
then I go back and

325
00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:01.640
fill in kind of the
action and the scene descriptions

326
00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:04.250
around that. I think that
also comes from being a

327
00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:06.680
journalist and sitting and listening
to hours and hours and

328
00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:09.590
hours of interview tapes and
transcribing them and really picking

329
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:12.590
up an ear for how
people speak. It's also being

330
00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:15.470
a script writer, you know,
especially I worked in kids'

331
00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:18.740
cartoons for a very long
time. And in a kid

332
00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:21.440
show, you don't have a
lot. You can't go on

333
00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:23.930
like a five page monologue.
You have to get that

334
00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:26.180
information across in one line
of dialogue, the same with

335
00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:28.940
comics, I'm writing for vertigo.
At the moment, my editor

336
00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:31.520
tells me if I go
two sentences, I'm waffling and

337
00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:33.020
I'm not allowed to do
it. So you have to

338
00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:35.900
make that sentence work so
hard. And it's got to

339
00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:38.390
convey so much about the
character, the subtext of what's

340
00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:41.540
really happening. And so that
stuff is something that I've

341
00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:43.490
been hunting for a long
time that comes very easily

342
00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:47.060
where one of the places
I struggle is action scenes

343
00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:49.940
and I hope they read
well, but those, those are

344
00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:52.430
the things that I have
to work at the hardest.

345
00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:54.680
I really have to sit
and Polish and craft them

346
00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:57.080
and kind of really think
about what's happening. Kind of

347
00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:59.750
play out the cinematography in
my head and sometimes act

348
00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:02.030
it out kind of tumbling
across, not, not quite, but

349
00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:04.640
you know, I will, I
will sit there and make

350
00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:07.730
hand gestures. Cause I'm thinking
about exactly how that punch

351
00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:09.590
was thrown and how they're
kind of falling into the

352
00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:12.310
sewer or whatever it is.
Do you, do you talk

353
00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:16.690
to other people, like I
spoke to another writer named

354
00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:20.140
Barry Eisler, who is a,
like a spy. He was

355
00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:24.100
a CIA agent and like
his dialogue is fine, but

356
00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:26.140
his action is like all
he does. Cause I think

357
00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:27.910
he was in karate or
something. So he might go

358
00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:32.890
three pages over six seconds,
six seconds of action. Cause

359
00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:36.130
that's obviously what his thing
is. And your dialogue and

360
00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:38.890
exposition is your thing. Do
you go and say, well,

361
00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:40.600
this guy knows karate. I
need to find a karate

362
00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:42.130
guy to tell me if
this is how they do

363
00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:45.040
it. I do consult a
lot of experts. I'm not

364
00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:48.370
specifically with the action scenes,
but with zoo city, you

365
00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:51.760
know, I spoke to several
paramedics just to get kind

366
00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:55.330
of the medical information, right.
And I, I try to

367
00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:57.100
get as much kind of
expert knowledge as possible. As

368
00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:00.760
you said, he also deals
with refugees and I interviewed

369
00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:03.040
a young guy from the
Congo. Who'd come, he'd walked

370
00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:05.710
down from the DRC to
Cape town and I really

371
00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:07.270
wanted to get a sense
of kind of his life.

372
00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:09.010
And he checked the slang
and the language for me.

373
00:17:09.370 --> 00:17:10.960
It's very important to me
to have that level of

374
00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:15.360
authenticity. So yeah, I think
it also with action scenes,

375
00:17:15.370 --> 00:17:19.570
it also helps watching a
lot of movies. Yeah. How

376
00:17:19.570 --> 00:17:22.660
do you keep from accidentally
taking someone else's idea? How

377
00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:26.260
do you keep from accidentally
plagiarizing? Because aggregation is a

378
00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:28.210
part of life and the
fact that there's so much

379
00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:31.000
information out there now, like,
I mean, Hemingway had his

380
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.660
life and newspapers and the
occasional silent movie, but effectively

381
00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:37.450
he was sitting in a
cafe in Paris writing from

382
00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:39.970
his brain, but now we're
getting bombarded. I mean, you're

383
00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:42.220
bombarded on Twitter for hours
a day before you get

384
00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:44.890
your feet under you. And
that's also, you know, like

385
00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:47.830
reading Boeing, Boeing and Nita
Rama, and you know, all

386
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:49.410
the websites, that's kind of
my, the start of my

387
00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:52.500
day. So, so you're aggregating,
but how do you make

388
00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:55.430
sure that aggregation doesn't turn
into plagiarism? I think it's

389
00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:56.900
how you use ideas. I
mean, the first thing you

390
00:17:56.900 --> 00:18:00.830
have to realize is that
no idea is original. You

391
00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:02.390
know, when I started writing
zoo city and I'm sure

392
00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:05.360
you've probably noticed this already.
It has quite a lot

393
00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:09.350
in common with Phillip Pullman
and his dark materials trilogy.

394
00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:11.660
I hadn't read that at
the time, but as soon

395
00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:13.490
as I spoke to a
friend of mine, who's kind

396
00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:16.490
of a very good sounding
board for me. He said,

397
00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:18.620
Oh, well it sounds like
Philip Pullman. You just, you

398
00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:21.320
shouldn't do it. And I
was like, really, but I

399
00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:23.840
really liked the idea. And
I went and I read

400
00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:26.090
the golden compass and I
was like, okay, this is

401
00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:28.580
a great book. And it's
not anything similar to what

402
00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:31.730
I'm doing. And that's okay.
So it's also about how

403
00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:33.890
you use the idea. The
same thing happened when I

404
00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:36.860
was writing Moxie land, I
read Margaret Atwood's Erickson, Craig

405
00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:39.500
and I finished the book
and I was like, what

406
00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:42.140
am I doing? Like, she's,
she's just done it better.

407
00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:45.050
There's no ways I could
actually compete with this. And

408
00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:47.030
the fact is that you're,
of course you are competing

409
00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:49.060
any kind of commercial level
and trying to publish and

410
00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:51.410
stuff. But if you can
find a different spin and

411
00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:53.360
a unique take on an
idea, that's really what you

412
00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:56.450
want to do. As far
as research goes, you know,

413
00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:58.910
when I'm transcribing notes, I
try to, you know, I

414
00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:00.980
collate from a lot of
different places and a lot

415
00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:03.830
of different sources. And it's
only if I'm using personal

416
00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:06.890
interviews that I'll kind of
use something directly. And obviously

417
00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:10.220
with that person's permission. But
otherwise, you know, you, you,

418
00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:12.920
it's also being a journalist
and, and you know, specifically,

419
00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:16.940
but having to be so
careful about plagiarizing. Yeah. So

420
00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:19.460
it's really a I'll transcribe
notes in a different way.

421
00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:21.290
You know, as I, as
I'm taking notes on something,

422
00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:24.260
I'll start changing the language
immediately is I'm very, very

423
00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:29.240
careful to try to avoid
doing that In. Let's talk

424
00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:30.770
about zoo city. Cause I'm
in the middle of it.

425
00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:34.820
No, no, no spoilers, but
I think it's fair to

426
00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:36.980
talk about me the first
couple of chapters, that kind

427
00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:38.540
of stuff you would flip
through. If you were looking

428
00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:40.310
at it in a bookstore.
Cause I want people to

429
00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:42.350
buy a zoo city. Cause
I, I bought Zoot Bosu

430
00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:44.570
city and Moxy land while
I was here hanging out

431
00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:49.550
with you in, in zoo
city. There's some, there's some

432
00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:52.130
I, again, I'm not a
writer, so forgiving, but the

433
00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:55.910
feeling there's some literary techniques
that I've heard before. And

434
00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:59.690
this may just be how
like Western writing is where,

435
00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:03.710
you know, where are we?
Where's the context? Are we

436
00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:05.270
in the future? Are we
in the past? Are we

437
00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:08.390
in an apartment? And you
you're, you're teasing us by

438
00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:12.500
giving us just like a
morsel of information per page.

439
00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:14.540
You know, you don't know
if this is a woman

440
00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:15.620
or a man and then
you find out it's a

441
00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:17.060
woman. You don't know what
color they are. You don't

442
00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:19.340
know how old they are.
Is this something that you're

443
00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:22.670
consciously doing? This kind of
dance is this, cause this

444
00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:25.640
seems like this is inherent
to Saifai more than fiction

445
00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:29.690
where you're, you're making me
wonder and I'm slowly having

446
00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:31.460
to paint it together. Did
you do that on purpose

447
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.260
To make readers work? I
think, I think, Oh, I

448
00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:39.110
hope it was enjoyable. No,
it was just like, I

449
00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:41.390
don't know what this person
looks like in my head.

450
00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:43.070
So I just have a
blank face and then I

451
00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:47.090
get hair and then I'll
get shoes and I'm assembling

452
00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:50.670
mind's eyes perspective of this
person. Look, I mean, some

453
00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:52.860
of that is South African
shorthand, you know, South African

454
00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:56.040
would immediately know that Zinzi
was a black woman's name

455
00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:59.070
and that's not necessarily, you
know, that is something that

456
00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:01.740
I have to think about
with international readers that I,

457
00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:04.410
that, you know, I try
to contextualize slang as much

458
00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:07.230
as possible so that you
can gain the meaning, but

459
00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:08.580
the stuff like that, which
I don't even think about

460
00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:11.550
it, I'm just like, Oh,
we'll figure it out. But

461
00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:14.340
it's, I don't know if
it's a specific literary technique.

462
00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:17.280
It's, it's really just that.
I, I like to trust

463
00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:19.290
that my reader is intelligent
and they can keep up.

464
00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:21.240
And, and I, you know,
the one thing I hate

465
00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:23.490
is the info dump. You
know, that scene in the

466
00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:25.710
bar where the one character
slings her arm around the

467
00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:28.110
other character and explains to
them like what's happened in

468
00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:30.690
the world and how it's
changed. And now criminals have

469
00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:32.760
these magical animals that you
can spot them a mile

470
00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:34.980
away. And they're kind of
rounded up into ghettos and

471
00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:39.090
kept segregated from society. That's
really painful. I'd much rather

472
00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:41.490
late, let it kind of
evolve. And again, this is

473
00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:43.710
a cinematic technique. You know,
if you watch something like

474
00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:46.440
children of men, you know,
in the first scene, he

475
00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:48.540
goes into one of my
favorite movies is so he

476
00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:50.850
goes amazing movie. So it
goes into a coffee shop

477
00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:53.400
and there's like a newspaper
headline on the wall. And

478
00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:56.040
I comment, you know, I
think it's about the BA

479
00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:58.560
the kid who's just about
who's just died or whatever

480
00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:01.080
it is. But you know,
movies provide you with those

481
00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:03.540
little contextual clues and they
don't have to tell you

482
00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:05.100
that information. So I'm trying
to do the same in

483
00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:07.740
my fiction, where there are
these contextual clues in the

484
00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:09.330
background and you have to
kind of pick them up,

485
00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:12.870
but then there's also kind
of information and I've woven

486
00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:16.230
through a lot of, kind
of found materials, like an

487
00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:18.870
IMDV page on a documentary,
which kind of explained some

488
00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:21.300
of the phenomenon. I was,
I was trying to make

489
00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:23.580
it as much like our
experience of the real world

490
00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:25.560
as possible, where we don't
just get us source of

491
00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:28.170
information from one source. You
know, we get information from

492
00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:32.670
absolutely everywhere. How did you
decide? Like when like, Oh,

493
00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:34.830
I'm on chapter three, I'm
on chapter four. I think

494
00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:38.100
about now they, the reader
should have figured out what's

495
00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:39.690
going on. So now we
can get into the meat

496
00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:41.970
of it. Like, how do
you decide how, how to

497
00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:44.340
reveal? And then of course,
I'm sure you have big

498
00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:48.180
reveals at the end, but
then also there's, there's always

499
00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:49.770
the need. And I think
it's part of the science

500
00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:53.370
fiction, readers personality for a
satisfying ending. There's like basically

501
00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:56.400
two kinds of cipher readers.
The, you better explain it

502
00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:57.690
to me all at the
end or I'm going to

503
00:22:57.930 --> 00:23:01.380
rage, quit your book, or
the you're going to leave

504
00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:03.780
it wide open. And I'll
never know what I mean.

505
00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:05.850
Like this, this doesn't feel
like there's any middle ground.

506
00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:08.040
You explain it in a
way that works in the

507
00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:12.420
physical world and makes like
self-consistent sense. Or you completely

508
00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:14.820
leave me up in the
end and there's no explanation

509
00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:17.190
for why this world exists.
How do you design that?

510
00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:21.750
I like ambiguity. I think
our experience of the real

511
00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:24.150
world is ambiguous. You know
what happens after we die?

512
00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:27.480
I don't know. You don't
know we've got theories, but

513
00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:29.400
no one knows that stuff.
For sure. So I wanted

514
00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:31.140
to have the same kind
of ambiguity. There are a

515
00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:32.910
lot of theories in the
book and you can develop

516
00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:37.560
your own, but yeah, I'm
afraid like some people might

517
00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:41.370
rage quit, so I'd have
ambiguity in my future. Yeah.

518
00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:44.520
When you make a universe
like this, like we were

519
00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:46.730
talking about, like you felt
with Moxy land, you just

520
00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:51.260
told the story, that universe
is, is over some writers,

521
00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:53.990
like the idea of their
writers universe. Like, you know,

522
00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:57.200
like everything Larry Nivon does
basically in the Nivon universe.

523
00:23:57.740 --> 00:24:00.020
And then sometimes people will
go and just write stuff

524
00:24:00.050 --> 00:24:02.360
in there in that guy's
universe, just cause he's so

525
00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:05.530
amazing. I just want to
be in his space. Have

526
00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:07.700
you thought about like, it
sounds like you want each

527
00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:11.180
book to be itself its
own universe, its own characters,

528
00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:14.560
its own timeline. Yeah. I
mean there are, there are

529
00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:18.640
separate universes. I'm not particularly
interested in going back to

530
00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:20.590
my slam because I told
the whole story that I

531
00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:22.750
wanted to tell them. It's
about a corporate apartheid state

532
00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:29.170
and it's about security theater
and it's about nanotechnology and

533
00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:32.320
advertising kind of mind control
and you know, kind of

534
00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:34.750
a lot of things where
we are really right now.

535
00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:36.760
And I said, all the
things that I wanted to

536
00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:39.820
say about that within, within
the book zoo city is

537
00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:43.300
a much more open universe.
I think Moxie land had

538
00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:45.590
a very kind of specific
intent and purpose and there's

539
00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:47.650
a lot, you know, there
was a scathing satirical edge

540
00:24:47.650 --> 00:24:51.400
there as well zoo city.
I could definitely go back

541
00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:54.640
to the time traveling book.
I, I think I'm going

542
00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:57.070
to be done when it's
done. Why, why could you

543
00:24:57.070 --> 00:24:58.630
go back to zoo city?
Cause I feel like you

544
00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:00.580
kind of, if I may,
you kind of light up

545
00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:02.320
a little bit, like you
have a fondness for that

546
00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:06.010
university, you want to be
in that space. I really,

547
00:25:06.370 --> 00:25:09.550
I really enjoyed the characters
and, and I think I

548
00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:12.100
could go back there and,
and, and there were also,

549
00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:14.530
there were unanswered questions in
Sioux city, not just about

550
00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:17.470
the universe, but about some
of the characters. I still

551
00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:19.270
think the ending is very
satisfying. Although I might be

552
00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:23.890
slightly biased on that account,
but there's definitely a space

553
00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:25.180
to play. And there was
stuff that I wanted to

554
00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:26.590
bring into the book. I
don't know if you've got

555
00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:28.750
to the point where they
talk about the dog fighting.

556
00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:31.810
Not yet. Okay. So basically
in Sioux city for your

557
00:25:31.810 --> 00:25:36.190
listeners, it's a universe where
criminals are saddled with magical

558
00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:39.250
animals. It's kind of a
curse and you can spot

559
00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:41.110
a criminal mile away because
they're walking down the road

560
00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:43.810
with an aardvark or an
EMU or whatever it is.

561
00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:48.490
And one of the shady
businesses, which has kind of

562
00:25:48.490 --> 00:25:52.780
sprung up around this kind
of segregated area of society

563
00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:55.930
and the ghetto is dog
fighting where you have a

564
00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:59.650
boxing match between people, but
their animals also find, and

565
00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:01.690
I did, I really wanted
to have a dog fighting

566
00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:04.060
scene in, in the, in
the novel. And it just,

567
00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:05.860
it would have slowed down
the pace. There was no

568
00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:07.330
space for it. There was
no purpose for it. It

569
00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:10.270
would have been completely gratuitous,
but it's something I was

570
00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:12.040
very, very interested in. And
if I was to do

571
00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:13.810
a sequel, I'd be very
interested in kind of exploring

572
00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:18.010
that scene as well as
kind of the, the CD

573
00:26:19.930 --> 00:26:22.570
kind of sex aspect, human
trafficking, that kind of thing.

574
00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:24.850
I'd be very interested in
getting into that. So you

575
00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:27.790
said that these, these, these
universes are, are on their

576
00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:30.670
own and they're self consistent
between the different, the three

577
00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:35.020
different books, but they all
have a South African style.

578
00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:37.060
They all have a, they
only exist in a universe

579
00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:39.790
where South Africa exists. They exist
in a universe where townships

580
00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:43.620
exists and where corporations exist.
Is that simply because you're

581
00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:47.070
South African or have you
thought about, was it just

582
00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:49.770
natural? Cause as a, as
an American reader reading it

583
00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:54.150
while I do have familiarity
with South Africa, we're on earth.

584
00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:58.110
We're, we're in South Africa, you
know, it's unclear if we're

585
00:26:58.110 --> 00:27:00.240
in a parallel universe or
for 20, 30 years in

586
00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:03.120
the future, that's all unclear,
but there is a lot

587
00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:07.410
of givens. It didn't need
to be on, on earth

588
00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:10.200
in South Africa in a, in
a place where race existed

589
00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:12.900
and things like that. What
do you think about things

590
00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:17.360
like that? You know, I
think the best science fiction

591
00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.870
and fiction tells us something
about who we are and

592
00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:23.390
where we are right now,
but specifically who we are.

593
00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:26.570
And as much as I
admire someone like China, Abel,

594
00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:28.580
and his, his most recent
book, embassy town is the

595
00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:32.990
most incredible novel about aliens
and how language works. And

596
00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:35.900
it's, it's all about kind
of metaphor. And it's absolutely

597
00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:38.480
fantastic. I don't know if
I could write that kind

598
00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:41.600
of thing because I'm, I'm
most interested in where we

599
00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:43.520
are right now and saying
something about the state of

600
00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:44.870
where we are right now.
And I feel like I

601
00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:46.850
have to write as close
as possible to where we

602
00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:49.910
are and there might be
some ridiculous conceit, like time

603
00:27:49.910 --> 00:27:53.420
travel or magical animals, but
it's still very much based

604
00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:56.150
on our world and very
close to our world. And

605
00:27:56.150 --> 00:27:58.010
that's for me as a
writer, that's what interests me

606
00:27:58.010 --> 00:28:00.080
most. And I'm very interested
in social issues and I'm

607
00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:02.630
very interested in race and,
you know, to some extent,

608
00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:06.170
all my novels are kind
of apartheid, allegories about segregation

609
00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:11.180
and about artificial divides imposed
between people. But the first

610
00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:14.360
two novels that were South
African, because, you know, that's

611
00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:17.030
what I wanted to write.
And, and you, you write

612
00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:20.270
what, you know, the new
novel is actually said in

613
00:28:20.270 --> 00:28:23.360
Chicago. And that was partly
because I didn't want to

614
00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:26.690
have to deal with politics.
You know, I wanted to

615
00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:29.480
just be able to concentrate
on this high concept all

616
00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:31.400
the time, traveling serial killer
and not make it a

617
00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:34.370
history of apartheid. So it,
it made sense to make

618
00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:37.520
it much more of a
generic kind of American novel.

619
00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:40.610
And it's been amazing getting
into Chicago history. It's been

620
00:28:40.610 --> 00:28:44.630
absolutely fascinating. I've been having
a fantastic time. Has that

621
00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:47.330
been tricky as an African,
trying to write about America

622
00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:51.110
and a clear voice that
is authentic? My publisher likes

623
00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:54.230
it so far, but I
also lived in America for

624
00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:56.900
six months in New York and
then six months in Chicago

625
00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:00.470
back in 2000, 2001, I
drove 10,000 miles across the

626
00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:03.890
USA and Canada and a
67 VW beetle in 1996.

627
00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:06.320
And my brother and I
just broke down every second

628
00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:09.770
town do not, do not
do trans continental in a

629
00:29:09.770 --> 00:29:14.120
67 VW people trust me.
It's like every movie where

630
00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:16.190
someone breaks down and then
they have to like find

631
00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:18.260
like the shadiest guy in
town to fix their car.

632
00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:20.810
Except you did it multiple
cities. Yeah. And we even

633
00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:22.910
broke down in a town
called hope. It was great.

634
00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.670
It was yeah, Arkansas. No,
it was a summer in

635
00:29:25.670 --> 00:29:29.510
Canada, near Vancouver, I think.
Yeah, it was, it was

636
00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:32.930
dire, but so I have
lived in the States and,

637
00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:35.510
and I'm going to Chicago
for a reconnaissance mission as

638
00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:37.940
well, just to, you know,
although I lived there, there's

639
00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:40.070
a lot of, kind of,
I'm digging quite deep into

640
00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:42.040
the social history as, so
I really want to go

641
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:44.680
and visit different locations. I'm
lining up some historians, take

642
00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:48.750
me around. And, and again,
just talking to people When,

643
00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:51.690
when you're writing the book
like that, do you, do

644
00:29:51.690 --> 00:29:53.460
you have a sense that
it could be 300 pages

645
00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:57.450
or 800? All right. Until
the story's done. And then

646
00:29:57.450 --> 00:29:59.580
my editor says, okay, you
need to add 10,000 words

647
00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:02.400
or 20,000 words. I'm like,
Oh really? And then I

648
00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:03.960
go back and flesh it
out. How did they do,

649
00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:06.120
why do they care? A
book has to be a

650
00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:09.030
certain length. Like a book
should be about 80,000 to

651
00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:11.910
a hundred thousand words. I
don't know why it's the

652
00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:15.720
rules. So you write until
you're done. And then they

653
00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:18.390
say add more or there's
too many notes, But you

654
00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:20.490
know what I like with
zoo city, the first draft

655
00:30:20.490 --> 00:30:23.880
I wrote was I think
60,000 words. And then, and

656
00:30:23.890 --> 00:30:25.440
then they came back and
said, listen, you need to

657
00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:27.240
explain more about the world.
It was a very lean

658
00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:29.490
mean draft. So I don't
actually have a problem with

659
00:30:29.490 --> 00:30:32.490
it, you know? And I
like, I love being pushed.

660
00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:34.380
You know, I want my
editor to push me and

661
00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:36.570
make the story as best
as possibly can be. I'm

662
00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:38.670
not, I'm not precious. I'm
not like, Oh no, it's

663
00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:41.160
my precious baby. You can't
touch it. It's like, well,

664
00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:42.480
you can touch it, but
you better make it better.

665
00:30:43.890 --> 00:30:47.610
Yeah. What a district nine,
the movie district nine as

666
00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:49.290
it, I thought the thing
that was great about district

667
00:30:49.290 --> 00:30:53.040
nine is that it, it
said that an extremely compelling

668
00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:56.130
science fiction movie can be
made on a reasonable budget

669
00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:59.100
that has a uniquely South
African tone and be it

670
00:30:59.130 --> 00:31:02.610
commercial success. When that happened.
Did that make you think

671
00:31:02.610 --> 00:31:05.070
that, as you said, he
could be a movie and

672
00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:08.160
do you play that kind
of imaginary thing where you

673
00:31:08.850 --> 00:31:10.290
sells your city and you
make it a movie and

674
00:31:10.290 --> 00:31:13.170
it becomes this amazing thing.
Like district nine, It's been

675
00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:15.270
optioned as a movie and
I'm working on the screenplay

676
00:31:15.270 --> 00:31:18.570
at the moment. What does
that mean option? It means

677
00:31:18.570 --> 00:31:21.720
an it, I assume real
estate's work the same way

678
00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:25.290
in America as they do
in South Africa. It's like when

679
00:31:25.290 --> 00:31:27.720
an estate agent says that
they will sell your house,

680
00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:29.970
but they want exclusivity so
they can put their boards

681
00:31:29.970 --> 00:31:33.390
up outside the house. Does
that make sense? Okay. Okay.

682
00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:35.100
I'll start again because that's
clear. He doesn't know that.

683
00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:38.790
Okay. So you're saying that
some agents, some movie studio

684
00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:40.050
says, I want to make
this movie. I don't know

685
00:31:40.050 --> 00:31:42.390
if I will, but I
want to be here. No,

686
00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:45.660
the movie producer says, I
am going to pay you

687
00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:48.390
a certain amount of money
for exclusivity to try and

688
00:31:48.390 --> 00:31:51.870
sell this movie to raise
the money because yeah, well,

689
00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:54.720
no, to, to raise the
money. So she, she wants

690
00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:57.090
to make it it's produced
called Halina spring. So she

691
00:31:57.090 --> 00:32:00.300
has paid an option. She
has the option automatically renews

692
00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:02.550
every year for three years,
with a set amount of

693
00:32:02.550 --> 00:32:07.320
money each year. It's not
a fortune. And during that,

694
00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:08.970
that gives her three years
to try and raise the

695
00:32:08.970 --> 00:32:11.400
funding. In the meantime I
have, I have set commitments.

696
00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:12.780
I have to write the
script. I have to write

697
00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:15.090
a second draft of the
script. And then she sends

698
00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:18.000
that out to a potential
investors and hopefully raises the

699
00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.900
full amount within those three
years to then actually go

700
00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:25.860
forward into reproduction. And I'm
finding production and shooting. This

701
00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:27.780
is all based entirely on
the strength of the script

702
00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:29.700
and then the commercial success
of the book. Or do

703
00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:31.980
you have like, cause I'm
thinking about this again as

704
00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:35.430
a, as a computer person,
cause I'm imagining, well, then

705
00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:38.790
she should be going with
like storyboards and concept art

706
00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:40.490
and a of what sins
he looks like. And then,

707
00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:43.150
okay. I definitely know that
the script has come first.

708
00:32:43.510 --> 00:32:46.750
We've got this amazing South
African concept, art company hero,

709
00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:48.820
concept design. And they did
a lot of work on

710
00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:52.960
the judge Dredd movie. And
they're just waiting for the

711
00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:55.420
script. They're ready to go.
They're very, very excited. And

712
00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:56.800
of course you need all
that. You need to give

713
00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:59.140
people like a real sense
and a feel in the

714
00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:00.610
meantime, she's also going to
be, as soon as she's

715
00:33:00.610 --> 00:33:02.290
got a script, she can
then start sending that out

716
00:33:02.290 --> 00:33:04.300
to directors and then you
want to attach a director

717
00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:07.780
and then, you know, obviously
the director will want to

718
00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:09.580
make it their own project
as well. And they might

719
00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:11.680
require script changes and they
might want to direct the

720
00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:15.010
concept on. So yeah, but
it's a process. I mean,

721
00:33:15.010 --> 00:33:18.370
99% of movies don't happen.
And the 1% that do

722
00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:21.880
take between four and 10
years to happen. So right

723
00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:24.070
now, because you know, you're
talking about millions and millions

724
00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:27.730
of dollars. So yeah. So
right now it's, it's really

725
00:33:27.730 --> 00:33:30.430
fun and I'm really enjoying
it. I'm getting threats screenplay,

726
00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:32.290
and I'm getting to have
a conversation and talking about,

727
00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:36.160
Oh, who would be great
for the casting? I know

728
00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:38.920
it's fantastic. But in the
meantime, you know, I'm not,

729
00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:40.450
I'm not holding it out
for it to be an

730
00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:43.180
absolute definite, it'll be really
amazing and wonderful if it

731
00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:45.190
happens. But in the meantime,
I've got other books to

732
00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:47.410
write and it's really exciting
and fun and I hope

733
00:33:47.410 --> 00:33:51.670
it does happen. Yeah. How
do you deal with, I

734
00:33:51.670 --> 00:33:53.350
thought you had this one
book that you're working on,

735
00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:55.300
but you have a screenplay
and you have the other

736
00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:58.210
word and you're writing for
vertigo comics. How do you

737
00:33:58.210 --> 00:34:00.250
decide what you're going to
work on today? And I

738
00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:03.610
mean, the psychic weight of
this multitasking must be difficult

739
00:34:03.670 --> 00:34:06.190
to me And it's difficult.
It's kind of like, dammit,

740
00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:08.290
why couldn't this stuff have
come up, you know, happened

741
00:34:08.290 --> 00:34:11.470
three years ago. But you
know, I've always had a

742
00:34:11.470 --> 00:34:13.690
day job and written novels
at the same time, you

743
00:34:13.690 --> 00:34:16.000
know, whether I was a
journalist or a script writer

744
00:34:16.570 --> 00:34:19.120
and that's quite tough to
write all day and then

745
00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:20.830
come home at night and
write some more, especially with

746
00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:27.040
three-year-old. But yeah, it's, it's
just management and it's deadlines.

747
00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:30.670
So, you know, vertigo, I
obviously have specific deadlines and

748
00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:31.990
what am I do is,
you know, if I have

749
00:34:31.990 --> 00:34:34.060
a deadline on Friday, I
might work Monday, Tuesday on

750
00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:36.340
my burger comic. And then
Wednesday I work on the

751
00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:40.210
screenplay mornings, Thursday I'll work
on the novel. So it's

752
00:34:40.210 --> 00:34:42.970
just kind of bouncing morning
and afternoon working after hours.

753
00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:46.510
Yeah. What is the vertical
comic that you're working on?

754
00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:50.140
I'm working on an offshoot
of the Willinghams fables. It's

755
00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:52.180
called fairest it's I don't
know how much you know

756
00:34:52.180 --> 00:34:55.480
about the fables universe. It's,
it's a really cool concept.

757
00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:59.560
It's been going for several
years and huge seller. It's

758
00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:03.850
won multiple eyes, no awards.
And it's about fairytale refugees

759
00:35:03.850 --> 00:35:06.070
living in the real world.
So you've got snow wides

760
00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:08.860
and the big, bad Wolf,
and they're all kind of

761
00:35:08.890 --> 00:35:13.210
hiding out in, in New York
city. And I'm, I'm doing

762
00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:16.510
the story of Rapunzel and
it's a six, six issue

763
00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:20.530
arc. And I'm basically going
into territory, which hasn't really

764
00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:22.990
been explored before in, in
Japan, I'm kind of Japanese

765
00:35:22.990 --> 00:35:26.110
fairytales, but it's very contemporary.
There's lots of sex and

766
00:35:26.110 --> 00:35:30.670
violence. And it's, my arc
is very dark. Actually. I'm

767
00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:32.590
working with an artist in
RQ Miranda, and he's just

768
00:35:32.590 --> 00:35:34.510
amazing to work with. And
this is one of the

769
00:35:34.510 --> 00:35:37.920
things I actually love is
collaboration and working in animation

770
00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:39.870
for a long time and
working in the animation studio

771
00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:42.720
where you could kind of
liaise with the animators just

772
00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:44.370
to see what someone else
brings to the process and

773
00:35:44.370 --> 00:35:47.370
how they interpret your words
and turn that into a

774
00:35:47.370 --> 00:35:50.730
drawing and how often that
will be even cooler than

775
00:35:50.730 --> 00:35:53.790
you imagined. And they'll just
add one detailing, like, yes,

776
00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:56.160
why didn't I think of
that? And it's, it's really,

777
00:35:56.250 --> 00:35:59.430
it's really exciting to do
that. That's cool. I I'm,

778
00:35:59.430 --> 00:36:01.400
I'm, I'm kind of the
same way when it comes

779
00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:04.190
to, we call it pairing
in the programming. I mean,

780
00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:06.800
I, you're always greater than
the sum of your parts.

781
00:36:07.070 --> 00:36:08.810
You know what I mean?
Just to, to sit with

782
00:36:08.810 --> 00:36:11.150
another person, you come up
with some more amazing stuff

783
00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:12.350
than if you come up
with it on your own.

784
00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:15.110
Definitely. I mean, other minds
are astonishing actually in zoo

785
00:36:15.110 --> 00:36:17.960
city, three of the chapters
are guest written by other

786
00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:21.620
people. Yeah. And one of
the best chapters as well,

787
00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:24.890
I'm like, damn, I wish
I thought about it there.

788
00:36:25.220 --> 00:36:28.910
The, the, in between the
found materials in between like

789
00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:32.000
the MDB page or visit,
you know, a psychology paper

790
00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.610
and all kinds of different
things. That was, that was

791
00:36:34.610 --> 00:36:36.470
something that I added after
I'd done. The first lean

792
00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:38.690
mean draft was I went
back and added all those

793
00:36:38.690 --> 00:36:41.420
things and I was running
up against my deadline and

794
00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:43.250
I spoke to a friend
of mine who is a

795
00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:45.380
music journalist. And I said,
look, I need to do,

796
00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:49.160
I would like to do
a music interview with my

797
00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:51.500
antagonist. Who's a music producer.
And I'd like to kind

798
00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:53.540
of throw that in. Can
I look at some of

799
00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:56.900
your old interviews to kind
of, to see exactly how

800
00:36:56.900 --> 00:36:58.130
you do it and how
you structured and kind of

801
00:36:58.130 --> 00:37:00.440
use that as inspiration. And
he was like, well, why

802
00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:02.330
don't you just let me
interview your character? And I

803
00:37:02.330 --> 00:37:04.790
was like, okay, Evan, you
know, he's not real, right.

804
00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:06.170
He's in my head. He's
like, yeah, let's do it.

805
00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:08.330
So he ended up writing
the interview. So I had

806
00:37:08.330 --> 00:37:10.940
this amazing music journalist this,
you know, this amazing South

807
00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:14.090
African music journalist very well
known, right. Guest write a

808
00:37:14.090 --> 00:37:16.820
chapter. And it worked out
so well that I asked

809
00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:20.210
two of my two, two
people. I know who'd been

810
00:37:20.210 --> 00:37:22.520
involved in the muscle and
short story competition, which my

811
00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:26.150
publisher had run and they
they'd won. And I asked

812
00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:27.740
them to write guest chapters
as well. And they just

813
00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:30.260
wrote the most fantastic, amazing
chapters, which was stuff I

814
00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:32.540
hadn't thought of. And the
one which was a psychology

815
00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:34.490
paper. And I don't think
you've got to that point

816
00:37:34.490 --> 00:37:38.420
yet, but it basically questions
the essence of my entire

817
00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:40.850
world. And I'm like, what
are you doing? But it

818
00:37:40.850 --> 00:37:43.040
was amazing. It was wonderful
because that's exactly what happens

819
00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:44.660
in the real world is
that we do question things

820
00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:47.600
and we do have completely
different theories of the world

821
00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:49.700
and how things work. And
it was so exciting to

822
00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:51.590
have that. And I love
getting fan fiction and I

823
00:37:51.590 --> 00:37:54.470
love seeing fan art. It's
amazing to see other people

824
00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:56.840
playing with your ideas. That
is a great idea. I

825
00:37:56.840 --> 00:38:00.150
love the music interview idea.
That's brilliant. Totally interview you.

826
00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:03.080
Okay. I know it was
amazing. So obviously he wrote

827
00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:04.250
it and then I went
back and tweaked to make

828
00:38:04.250 --> 00:38:06.410
sure that it was completely
coherent with the plot and

829
00:38:06.410 --> 00:38:09.110
then sent it back to
him and yeah. Oh, this

830
00:38:09.110 --> 00:38:11.570
makes me even more excited
to finish the book. So

831
00:38:11.570 --> 00:38:13.640
we're going to put links
up to Sioux city and

832
00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:15.320
Moxie land and a school
as well as your blog

833
00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:17.690
and your Twitter. So people
can get involved in the

834
00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:20.990
Lauren BUCAs world. And I
would very much encourage people

835
00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:24.410
to pick up a zoo
city. I bought it myself.

836
00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:26.990
I bought it on Kindle.
Although I feel like I

837
00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:29.390
should like give you, you
know, Amazon's in between us.

838
00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:31.760
I feel I should just
give you money. Just give

839
00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:35.800
me money, everyone. This PayPal
Lauren money. No, because she'll

840
00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:38.220
get more than if you
buy it from Amazon, but

841
00:38:38.650 --> 00:38:40.930
definitely check those out. And
I thank you so much

842
