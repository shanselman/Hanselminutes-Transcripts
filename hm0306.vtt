Scott talks with Curtis Pope

7
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.700
CEO of isle finder about
creating a location-based mobile startup.

8
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.120
Hi, this is Scott Hanselman
and this is another episode

9
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.850
of Hansel minutes. And today
I'm going to talk about

10
00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.250
startups and mobile. I've talked
a little bit about startups

11
00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.590
lately. I've talked a little
bit about mobile, but now

12
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.500
I've got someone who's actually
doing both. Okay. Curtis hope

13
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.290
on the phone, who is
the CEO of isle finder.

14
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.050
Thanks for chatting with me.
Oh, thanks, Scott. I really

15
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.840
appreciate taking time to talk
to me. This is an

16
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.350
honor. No, no, my pleasure.
My pleasure. So I'll find

17
00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.800
her. What is it? I
will find her as essentially

18
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.880
Google maps for supermarkets. So
we help people navigate grocery

19
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.400
stores by giving him the
aisle numbers of the items

20
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.330
on their shopping list. Okay.
So that's that's mapping, but

21
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.110
it's inside of a building.
It's where do you get

22
00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.830
that? We get it directly
from the store is actually

23
00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.430
so with every one of
our sores that's inside of

24
00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.780
our app, we essentially contact
them. We make a small

25
00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.860
relationship with the store manager
and then we, you know,

26
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.080
start that relationship by gathering
information and trying to ascertain

27
00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.780
where things are in the
store and what kind of

28
00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.260
layout they have in their
stores, because all the stores

29
00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.450
are different. I mean, you
go to any store in

30
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.730
the U S and you
know, nine times out of

31
00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.760
10, they're all different from
each other. So that's kind

32
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.870
of the challenge that we're
we're facing every day. So

33
00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.350
grocery stores aren't, aren't standardized
like Safeway is a common

34
00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.130
grocery store here or Kroger
in, in the U S

35
00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.310
they don't say, well, you
know, every Safeway has to

36
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.040
have its produce off to
the one side. They don't

37
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:33.260
standardize. No, essentially what happens
is every store has they

38
00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.070
take into account the demographic
data who's buying, what and

39
00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.010
what kind of audience they're
serving, so to speak. And

40
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.730
then you coupled that with
the fact that store managers

41
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.790
have full autonomy, so they
can decide, you know, on

42
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.490
a whim that, you know,
they need to move the

43
00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.520
produce to the, the exact
other side of the store.

44
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.590
And all they have to
do is run it up

45
00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.900
the flagpole and say, Hey,
we're going to do this

46
00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.590
because you know, our customers
are constantly coming in this

47
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.100
entrance and you know, this
is where they expect things

48
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.160
to be. Or, you know,
they expect the, you know,

49
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.410
the baby food to be
on the top shelf or

50
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.200
the, you know, the, the
very back of the store

51
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.420
because they want people to
walk through the store. So

52
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.850
there's a lot of really
thought, really thoughtful actions that

53
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.640
go into the process of
putting things on the shelf

54
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.750
and locating things within the
store. And how often does

55
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.670
that data change? I mean,
if I'm a store manager,

56
00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.230
how often am I going
to decide to move an

57
00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.390
entire aisle? I'll give you
a few examples. So with

58
00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.710
the store, by my house,
they changed things probably once

59
00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:41.880
every three months, which, which
is pretty fair. Actually, I

60
00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.970
think that that's great, but
you know, the fact is

61
00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.100
that they just don't have
the budget to hire in

62
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.890
a company to do this
sort of thing on a

63
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.930
month to month basis. So
what they try to do

64
00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.750
is think of the changes
that they want to do.

65
00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.510
And every six months to
a year and a half,

66
00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.020
that's usually when they're, they're
actually moving things around and,

67
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.600
and, and figuring out what
the layout's going to look

68
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.720
like for, you know, the
next year and a half

69
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.840
from that. So, so it's
a big commitment for them.

70
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.680
When I talked to the
kids, the grocery kids and

71
00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.860
the people who work at
the, at the grocery store,

72
00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.470
they always know where stuff
is, they'll know immediately where

73
00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.990
it is now. I assume
that that's because there's a

74
00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:24.630
map and like internally they
have some document, maybe it's

75
00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.840
on paper, but surely there's,
there is a master map

76
00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.840
that the guy in charge
can just hand out and

77
00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.940
say, all right, you know,
memorize this, can they just

78
00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.430
fax you some master map?
Or is it all just,

79
00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.130
it is where it is.
Yeah. It's a little bit

80
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.120
More heuristic than that. I
actually, my very first job

81
00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.750
was actually in a supermarket.
So I kind of know

82
00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.500
what the internal workings are.
And, and ironically, none of

83
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.980
that has really changed from
chain to chain. There are

84
00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.470
some chains that actually, you
know, they pride themselves on

85
00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.950
giving their customers this sort
of information Railey's and knob

86
00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.500
Hill. They do this thing
all the time. They, you

87
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.290
know, they even put it
on the carts, but some

88
00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.540
stores are a little bit
more secretive about that. They

89
00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.990
don't want their competitors to
know, you know, where they're

90
00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.750
late, how they're late, how
their store's laid out. They

91
00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.020
see it as competitive advantage
as far as like the

92
00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.780
employees working at the store.
You're right. These are like

93
00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:23.790
the best resources for finding
things within the store. Oftentimes

94
00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.180
I know here in California,
it's, it's more or less

95
00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.880
you, you asked the kind
of questions like, you know,

96
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.240
where is, you know, the
cardamom seeds and, you know,

97
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.220
the, the person will look
at you as though is

98
00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.970
this the animal mineral or
vegetable, you know, so, so

99
00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.610
it's more like the hard
to find stuff. We want

100
00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.840
to categorize that stuff in
order to let people navigate

101
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.490
and know where those things
are. If they want to

102
00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.840
try the next Rachel Ray recipe,
or, you know, Mario Batali

103
00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.490
recipe. And it has that
real unique, distinct, you know,

104
00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.210
ingredient, they just can't find,
or it's hard to find

105
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:02.090
them then of course, that's
why you use aisle finder.

106
00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:05.350
So in my, in my
mind, whenever I hear about

107
00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:07.900
a new application, I think
you probably do the same

108
00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.330
as it, as a developer
type. I start building the

109
00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.660
data model. So I'm thinking
to myself, well, I could

110
00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:16.900
create, you know, there's stores
and stores have aisles and

111
00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.870
aisles have numbers and aisles
have sides. So there's like

112
00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:22.930
21, a and 31 B
and stuff like that. But

113
00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:25.780
at the same time, I
could be generic. I could

114
00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:30.070
say, well, breads are on
three a or I could

115
00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:33.880
say this specific brand of
Dave's bread is there. And

116
00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.900
then suddenly my data model
gets really full. It's a

117
00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.650
complete store inventory. How deep
do you go in, in

118
00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:46.210
detail? We actually go pretty
deep. And it's funny that

119
00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:49.390
you, that you mentioned that
process, you know, that you

120
00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:51.790
go through yourself because I
do the same thing. You

121
00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:54.370
were thinking of things in
a very object oriented way.

122
00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.850
And you know, when I,
you know, I'm a developer

123
00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:59.950
and a designer, so, you
know, that's kind of how

124
00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:01.870
I thought. I said, well,
you know, what are the

125
00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:04.540
objects of the store? You
know, you have your customers,

126
00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:06.610
you have your products, you
have your aisles, you have,

127
00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:10.870
you know, your, your individual
inventory, all these different things,

128
00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:14.410
and you have your categories
as well. And so initially

129
00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:17.350
we started just doing category
mapping. So we said, okay,

130
00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:20.380
your paper goods are on
this aisle. Your produce is

131
00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:24.790
on the left side. Your,
you know, your baby food,

132
00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:27.700
your baby products are essentially
on this aisle, you know,

133
00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:29.710
so it was very vague
in the very beginning. But

134
00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:32.860
as you see, like more
data popping up in our

135
00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.920
store, you'll see that there's
a little bit more specificity,

136
00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:41.020
as far as, you know,
what side, what shelf, this

137
00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:45.220
sort of information. It gets
really, really, really granular, but

138
00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:47.800
we try to, you know,
make it really simple for,

139
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:49.810
you know, our shoppers, the
people that are using our

140
00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:52.900
apps so that they can
get at least a good

141
00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:55.990
sense of where things are
in the store. And do

142
00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:58.630
you intend it to become
a shopping, a shopping list

143
00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:00.430
where I would go in
and put down the exact

144
00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:04.690
products, and then you start
keeping pricing information and all,

145
00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:07.180
you know, all the details
down to like scanning that

146
00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:10.240
item. Like, might I go
through my house, UPC scan

147
00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.100
a bunch of things, and
then you'll tell me what,

148
00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:17.950
in what order to walk.
Yeah, actually, it's interesting that

149
00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:20.980
you mentioned that because we
actually have an API that

150
00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:25.120
exposes all that data, you
know, pricing, data included. And

151
00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:28.240
the next version of that
is actually gonna have, you

152
00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:32.770
know, barcode information, UPC information
so that people can do

153
00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:36.760
that sort of tracking of
what their mind, you know,

154
00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:39.460
by essentially when you throwing
a jar away, just scan

155
00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:42.550
the barcode and it's added
to your list. You know,

156
00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:46.450
this kind of information is
really helpful because that's just

157
00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:49.450
the way people are shopping
these days. It's, you know,

158
00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:52.840
it's the process now. So
as a business person, then

159
00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:58.110
your, your, your property is
kind of in two places,

160
00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:00.150
you've got the application and
the data model and the,

161
00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.250
you know, the services and
you've got, you know, all

162
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.650
the different apps for all
the different phones, but it's

163
00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:07.260
also the data that you've
collected and the relationships that

164
00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.650
you've built with those, you
know, with those grocery stores,

165
00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:13.530
I suppose the competition would
have to, if they were

166
00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:15.120
to come up, they would
have to start calling all

167
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.340
of these grocery stores and
building those relationships that you've

168
00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:19.940
built over the last few
years. Yeah. And, and it's,

169
00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:22.880
it's hard business, you know,
when I first started this,

170
00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:26.170
I mean, literally there was,
I mean, the history of,

171
00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:28.850
of doing an app like
this, or even a, you

172
00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:31.190
know, in the past, it
was like, you know, an

173
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:34.610
application that you would have
on your, on your PC.

174
00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:37.940
Just the fact of doing
this on, on that kind

175
00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:40.160
of level was so, so
difficult that a lot of

176
00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.340
people gave up on the
idea. So what I did

177
00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:46.040
was when I wanted to
actually build this out there

178
00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:47.780
wasn't anybody out there that
I can just kind of

179
00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:50.990
model my pattern after. This
was something that, you know,

180
00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:53.180
I knew I had to
kind of create from scratch.

181
00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:57.080
And so it is hard
gathering that data, that, and

182
00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:00.290
so I, knowing that that's
why I created an API,

183
00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:03.950
so I can help other
developers to essentially build off

184
00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:06.800
the platform and build off
of our experience and also

185
00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:09.710
our relationships and our data
so that they can at

186
00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:12.380
least, you know, hit the
ground running and not have

187
00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:15.860
to, you know, not have
to go through the process

188
00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:19.580
of, you know, calling each
store and everything. So, All

189
00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:21.410
right. Well, let me dig
into a couple of questions

190
00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:23.180
that I think that people
who, who don't have a

191
00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:25.670
startup might want to understand,
because I know that I

192
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:29.330
want to understand these things.
Sure. So you, How many

193
00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:32.870
people are you let's start
there Right now, it's four

194
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:37.070
people. So it's me. And
then I have three full

195
00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:40.580
time. I have one full
time person and two temporary

196
00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:46.040
people. And, and this one
person Janeka, she's actually the,

197
00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:49.190
I call it the archivist.
She's like the chief archivist.

198
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:53.510
So she's charged with actually
calling each store, making the

199
00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:56.780
relationship and, and at least
getting the ball rolling to

200
00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:59.570
where they can contact someone
about, you know, gathering data.

201
00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:04.730
The second person, his name
is Harpreet, and he's a

202
00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:07.400
really cool guy. He's more
a kind of a generalist.

203
00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:10.160
He kind of does everything
that we need to get

204
00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:13.940
done, you know, from answering
emails, to calling up stores

205
00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:17.720
and, and, and all that.
And then there's a, another

206
00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:22.730
guy, his name is Phillip
gothy. Wow. It was still

207
00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:25.340
a golf that day. He's
from India as well. And,

208
00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:28.580
and what his job is,
is actually on the data

209
00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:33.200
acquisition side. So he's more
dealing with the product information,

210
00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:36.770
making sure that's up to
date and a UPC information.

211
00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:40.670
As of late, he's been
really, you know, kind of

212
00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:43.670
forging the path with that
and, and taking that over

213
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:46.760
so that I can focus
on the development design. And

214
00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:49.460
we're looking to hire like
one more person over the

215
00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:53.150
next year. You're the chief
designer, you're the chief developer,

216
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.720
or you're the CEO, but
you're also like you own

217
00:11:55.720 --> 00:12:00.060
the code. Yeah, exactly. So
every pixel and every line

218
00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:02.550
of code is all me.
And this is real common.

219
00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:04.020
When you think about like
a, what we call a

220
00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:06.870
micro ISV or kind of
a startup is that there's,

221
00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:10.290
everyone's gotta be good at
everything, you know, and you're

222
00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:12.990
incubating this thing. There's no
time to hire 20 people

223
00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:15.450
and start burning money. If
you go through this yourself

224
00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:18.390
and you do it yourself.
When I go to the

225
00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:22.710
website though, I'll find her.com
it's totally professional. And the

226
00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:26.220
first thing that I'm kind
of surprised to see is

227
00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:30.150
the press. And it's like
tech crunch and ReadWrite web,

228
00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:34.170
and seeing that CNN money,
how PC magazine, how are

229
00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:36.420
you able to do that?
How do you get that

230
00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:39.000
kind of press? Cause I
know so many people, I

231
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.770
get a lot of emails
from folks and I see

232
00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:44.370
a lot of products that
just can't get the story

233
00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:47.850
told. Is that, is that
you and your team, or

234
00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:50.040
is that that like, are
you able to somehow get

235
00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:51.690
these guys to write about
you or is it just

236
00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:53.460
that it's a great idea
and they want to write

237
00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:57.420
you about it, right? Oh
man. That's a hard question.

238
00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:01.050
It's a little bit of
both, to be honest. I

239
00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:03.180
mean, we don't have like
a PR company. We don't,

240
00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:05.410
you know, we don't do
any of that stuff. We,

241
00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:09.120
we, we don't spend hardly
anything on marketing, if anything,

242
00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:13.860
it's like, you know, you
know, Google ads, that's about

243
00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:16.770
the most that we spend
on marketing. If, if anything,

244
00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:21.960
and even that is like
a shoestring budget. So the

245
00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:24.150
way that we've been able
to do it, I mean,

246
00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:27.180
it's mostly me because what
I do is actually I

247
00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:30.960
contact writers and just kind
of, I make the relationship.

248
00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:32.970
I tell them what we're
doing. You know, I send

249
00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:35.490
them a lot of screenshots
in order for them to,

250
00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:39.540
you know, build the story.
And oftentimes what really works

251
00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:42.660
is, is just framing your
individual story and saying, look,

252
00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:45.390
you know, I got really
tired of, of, you know,

253
00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:47.700
being lost in the grocery
store. I wanted to build

254
00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:50.250
an app that would, you
know, help that help, that

255
00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:53.280
particular problem. And, and, you
know, I built something and,

256
00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:54.900
you know, if you guys
would like to write about

257
00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:57.420
it, that'd be really great.
If not, then, you know

258
00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:00.120
what part is friends and,
and, you know, I still

259
00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:05.490
appreciate, but I still appreciate
the, the opportunity, you know,

260
00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:09.210
to at least reach out
and more times than not

261
00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:13.560
actually writers. If you really
follow a writer, that's usually

262
00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:17.100
the best bit of advice
that I give any startup

263
00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:20.370
is if you follow a
writer specifically, then, you know,

264
00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:22.800
tell them, let them know
just like us. We like

265
00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:25.650
to be appreciated for our
work. And that's, their work

266
00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:29.370
is building and crafting stories
and telling stories in order

267
00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:32.640
to help the public, understand
what companies are about. And,

268
00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:35.880
and, you know, I've been
very fortunate to, to, you

269
00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:39.750
know, make relationships and, and
tell them my story. And,

270
00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:42.090
and if they identify with
it, they write about it.

271
00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:44.460
If not, then, you know,
it's still good to get

272
00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:47.790
in contact with, with people
in the media. Don't don't

273
00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:50.100
you get overwhelmed though. I
mean, you're the CEO, you're

274
00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:53.030
the chief developer got an
iPhone app. You've got a

275
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:56.570
backend, you've got an Android
app and you're making relationships

276
00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:59.000
with the press. Yeah. That
implies that you are what

277
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.660
we call in the computer
industry, a well balanced person.

278
00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:08.600
You can actually have conversations
with regular people. Yeah. I

279
00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:10.250
don't know if I could
put all of those hats

280
00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:12.140
on and I certainly would
be overwhelmed. I mean, if

281
00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:14.930
you're sitting down on a
random Thursday afternoon, I mean,

282
00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:19.760
you know, like today and
you got to get some

283
00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:22.100
work done, you got like
a master plan, you got

284
00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:24.230
to migrate the database, which
you also got to talk

285
00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:27.350
to, you know, get interviewed
and photographed by magazine. Did

286
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:30.490
she get overwhelmed? Yeah, absolutely.
This is, this is part

287
00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:33.480
of the reason why I'm
hiring someone this year too,

288
00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:37.420
to work directly with me
that that can, can do

289
00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:39.910
a lot of, kind of
what I do. And this

290
00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:43.810
is also why, you know,
the, the one employee, who's

291
00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:46.450
more of like an assistant.
His name is RP, you

292
00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:49.330
know, he's so essential because
anything that basically I need

293
00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:51.850
to offload and I, and
I know he's capable of

294
00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:54.370
doing, I just sent him
an email. I say, RP,

295
00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:57.010
check my email, you know,
make sure that I'm really

296
00:15:57.010 --> 00:16:00.610
following up and not just
him and to be sincere

297
00:16:00.610 --> 00:16:03.070
about it is really the
tough part because, you know,

298
00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:05.860
I get 50 questions a
day about just our API

299
00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:10.120
and, and, you know, I
really, I really care that's

300
00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:12.850
the difference is, is that,
to me, it's not really

301
00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:15.670
work either. It's something that
I really enjoy. I really

302
00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:19.810
enjoy reaching out to startups
and, and, you know, being

303
00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:22.870
in this sphere where I
can actually meet other entrepreneurs

304
00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:26.170
and, and bounce ideas off
of and different things like

305
00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:31.480
that. It's, it's overwhelming at
times, but I think I

306
00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:35.560
found a pattern of, of
doing it. That that makes

307
00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:39.040
a lot of sense. I
think that the passion of

308
00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:41.260
course must come out. When
you talk to people, I

309
00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.240
know you go to startup
events, you are located in

310
00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:46.990
California, so the passion definitely
comes out. Do you think

311
00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:49.540
that being located in California
makes it easier than if

312
00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:53.200
you were in Iowa? Oh,
I think so. I mean,

313
00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:55.300
I've, I've, I've been fortunate
enough to actually grow up

314
00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:59.020
out here. So, so that's
a big advantage of just

315
00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:01.360
kind of knowing, you know,
the lay of the land

316
00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:06.640
a little bit. I think
I only realized it as

317
00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:09.880
a recent, the people that
you will actually run out,

318
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.970
run into living out here.
Like last week I tweeted

319
00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:18.670
a tweet that I was
standing in back of Johnny

320
00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:21.310
I've the, the, you know,
the Apple designer, he designed

321
00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:24.400
the iPad, the iPod, the,
you know, the iPhone, all

322
00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:27.010
these products. And he's just
like, he's a regular Joe

323
00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:29.620
just like me and he's
out to lunch as well.

324
00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:33.730
So, you know, it really
provides an advantage. Just the

325
00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:35.560
people that you'll meet in
the network that you can

326
00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:40.150
build. If you're an entrepreneur,
You had mentioned an API

327
00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:42.940
and not only do you
have, I'll find her.com, but

328
00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:47.020
also your supermarket api.com. So
you've actually got a, that,

329
00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:48.940
that API that you mentioned,
but it's also an open

330
00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:53.640
API. Yes. So help me
understand. I just thought a

331
00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:57.900
minute ago that your intellectual
property is the location of

332
00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:00.510
all of this stuff, but
now you're giving that away.

333
00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:04.530
So how what's to keep
me from making like better,

334
00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:07.590
I'll find her.com and just
calling your API and then

335
00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:10.940
crushing you, but you have
to do the, I know,

336
00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:14.000
right. I know that seems
kind of, kind of a

337
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.880
weird thing to do, but,
you know, I read something

338
00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:20.660
really recently that that changed
my whole opinion of providing

339
00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:24.290
an API. And it was
a book called rework and,

340
00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:27.830
and it was talking about
how, you know, chefs give

341
00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:31.160
away the recipes all the
time. Does it mean that

342
00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.680
you're going to open up
a restaurant right next to

343
00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:36.440
them and put them out
of business? No, but you

344
00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:39.170
know, what it does is
it enriches their community. It

345
00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:43.220
helps people to identify with
them and really take into

346
00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:45.560
account that these people are
really trying to help you

347
00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:49.010
to understand what they do.
And, you know, the same

348
00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:52.040
kind of premise is behind
supermarket API. I wanted to

349
00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:54.950
build something that would not
only help us to build

350
00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:57.830
a community of people that
are like-minded. They want to

351
00:18:57.830 --> 00:19:02.720
build something, but also recognize
that the state is very

352
00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:06.020
hard to find. It's very
hard to parse, very hard

353
00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:08.390
to have in one central
place, that's up to date

354
00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:12.110
all the time. And so
just providing that, I said,

355
00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:15.050
you know what, if even
if people build something better

356
00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:17.420
than I will find her,
that's fine, but at least

357
00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:20.040
they'll be using our API
to do that. And, and

358
00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:22.550
you know, who knows, we're
just want to be one

359
00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:28.460
of those, one of those
pillars in the community, as

360
00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:31.580
far as grocery goes, we
want to make sure that,

361
00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:33.530
you know, we have a
long life with this company

362
00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:37.730
and it hasn't, it actually
has been a much more

363
00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:42.860
profitable business. To be honest,
the API itself is, is

364
00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:45.410
kind of the moneymaker and,
and I'll find her has

365
00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:48.860
become more like the passion
project. The thing that really

366
00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:52.580
drives the innovation of our
API. So it's really a

367
00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:57.320
display for our API. I'll
find her husband. Interesting. So

368
00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:59.810
what kind of things are
people building? Are these private

369
00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:03.800
apps? Are these companies like,
like Safeway that are using

370
00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:06.110
these, this data internally? Cause
I haven't seen a lot

371
00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:08.690
of, I'll find our competitors
built on top of your

372
00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:12.200
API. So where, where are
the client apps hiding of

373
00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:16.580
these, these things? You know
what I've seen actually, because

374
00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:20.330
this week we're actually talking
about actually rate limiting the,

375
00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:24.620
the open source version, just
because it's it, we have

376
00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:27.470
users that are constantly, I
don't know what they're building,

377
00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:32.240
but, but they're constantly, you
know, you know, messing up

378
00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:35.120
my, my connection pools and
stuff like that. So it's

379
00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:37.550
just like one of these
things, like, I'm always wondering

380
00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:40.280
what are they building, but
I know like the domains

381
00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:43.580
that they've attached to, you
know, the API APIs and,

382
00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:46.250
you know, I can't really
say on, on air what

383
00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:49.390
you, what they're, but I
mean, some pretty heavyweight people

384
00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:51.970
are actually using our API
and I've looked on their

385
00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:55.480
sites and stuff. And I
see like images and things

386
00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:58.660
like that, that we've pulled
over. So, so that tells

387
00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:00.400
me a few things that
tells me that a, we

388
00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:03.820
need to revise our, our
terms of use, where people

389
00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:06.760
can actually put on their
site, built with Al finder

390
00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:11.860
and B we need to,
you know, make sure that,

391
00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:15.910
that we at least know
who's building what on our

392
00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:19.090
API in, in a more
clear way so that people

393
00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:22.600
can get inspired and build
something that, you know, maybe

394
00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:26.260
goes into competition with it.
I don't know. The possibilities

395
00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:28.240
are kind of endless when
it comes to, you know,

396
00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:31.120
open sourcing something or providing
API for people to build

397
00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:34.260
on. So, Hmm. Well, you
do have that API key,

398
00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:36.810
right? I mean, people have
to sign up to call

399
00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:39.540
everything other than, you know,
getting a list of States.

400
00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:42.270
So you know who they
are because they signed up.

401
00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:45.870
Yeah, Exactly. And I can,
I actually matched that directly

402
00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:49.530
to the queries that I'm
seeing come across our, our

403
00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:52.110
wire. And the thing is
like, I mean, these are,

404
00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:54.990
like I said, these are
pretty heavyweight companies and I

405
00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:57.240
don't want to kind of
out them by of course,

406
00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:00.010
of course. Yeah. But I
mean, there's pretty some, some

407
00:22:00.030 --> 00:22:02.580
pretty nice companies that I
think in the next coming

408
00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:05.490
weeks, they're going to actually
announce some things because they're

409
00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:09.210
doing some heavy, heavy testing
and every morning I wake

410
00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:11.430
up to it, you know,
so Yeah. Yeah. So do

411
00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:13.410
you run this in the
cloud or is this running

412
00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:15.990
in a box under your
desk or is this running

413
00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:18.300
and I assume because of
the nature of the data,

414
00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:20.340
you can probably just cash
the heck out of it.

415
00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:24.510
Yeah, Exactly. So, so we
are doing some caching right

416
00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:27.930
now. I just met with
someone over at, on the,

417
00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:31.170
is your team to move
everything over to the cloud

418
00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:36.300
and use, you know, some,
some databases and things like

419
00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:39.420
that in the cloud, as
far as Microsoft, as your

420
00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:43.290
technology. And so, so that's
kind of the road ahead

421
00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:46.560
for this year is to
migrate everything over there, just

422
00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:49.140
because we want that uptime.
We want to make sure

423
00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:53.010
that everything has some consistency,
you know, cause right now

424
00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:55.530
it's on shared hosting. So
that's kind of the tough

425
00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:57.510
thing. You know, if you
go over your bandwidth, you're,

426
00:22:57.930 --> 00:23:01.080
you're pretty much done. And
you know, it's, you know,

427
00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:04.500
it's a real tough sell,
you know? And so now

428
00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:07.080
it's kind of like, we've
outgrown our britches and now

429
00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:11.010
we need new ones Do.
So you have me right

430
00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:12.240
up to the point where
you said that you were

431
00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:15.810
running on shared hosting. Yeah.
This is like a company

432
00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:18.330
and you're in tech crunch
and you're being, you know,

433
00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:21.750
doesn't that seem a little
bit shortsighted. I mean, this

434
00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:26.010
should be a lot more,
I don't know. I just

435
00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:27.620
expected you to have a
data center of some kind.

436
00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:32.100
No, no, no. Because our
data set is huge. Whoever,

437
00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:35.130
like I said, I mean,
I've utilized.net to, you know,

438
00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:37.680
to where we do have
shared hosting, but we also

439
00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:41.520
have many servers that, you
know, are clustering and, you

440
00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:45.590
know, making it high availability.
So it's just one of

441
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:48.500
these things that, you know,
we'd rather come up with

442
00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:51.050
a solution that makes more
sense that's in the cloud

443
00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:53.840
and that people can link
back to and do different

444
00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:57.080
things with than just something
that's low. That's nailed down

445
00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:00.070
to a box and, and
all that. Well. And like

446
00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:03.460
you say, because it's a,
it's a giant, largely read

447
00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:07.660
most datasets. It's not like
Twitter where people are writing

448
00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:09.730
to it more than they're
reading from it. Or maybe

449
00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:12.880
equally you could probably keep
the entire data set in

450
00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:17.710
memory and stay off the
SQL server entirely. Well, you

451
00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:20.650
know, that's actually something we're
exploring right now is, you

452
00:24:20.650 --> 00:24:23.470
know, just we're analyzing the
data to see, okay, how

453
00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:25.840
many searches are we getting
a day? How many of

454
00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:29.380
those things, how many are
of the exact same object

455
00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:32.050
that we can, you know,
just keep cashed up and

456
00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:36.310
like our, our staple items
list that starts everyone off.

457
00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:38.890
That's pretty much all in
cash. I mean, that's stuff

458
00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:41.830
that's just, you know, transported
over using a new session.

459
00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:44.650
So, so I mean, those
are the things that we're

460
00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:48.100
really exploring and, you know,
I mean, I'm kind of

461
00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:51.370
a one on one man
army here. So I need

462
00:24:51.370 --> 00:24:53.410
someone to come in and
kind of help me with

463
00:24:53.410 --> 00:24:55.900
that and help me scope
the vision of where we

464
00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:59.380
want to go. Just because,
you know, we're, we're growing

465
00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:02.380
at such a rapid rate
that it's just, it just

466
00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:04.570
makes the most sense. So,
I mean, that's another thing

467
00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:07.510
for startups. I think it's
important to start out a

468
00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:10.600
certain way, like start out
really small, you know, prove

469
00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:14.350
your concept, get your customers
really early on. And then

470
00:25:15.130 --> 00:25:17.860
as you grow, make those
changes go out, you know,

471
00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:20.710
don't build the data center
first, then, you know, then

472
00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:23.740
build your app. I mean,
build something small, prove your

473
00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:27.010
concept and then scale it
out. So that brings me

474
00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:29.800
to an actually an interesting
question. Then when did this

475
00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:32.260
go from being a side
thing to being the full

476
00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:36.520
time thing? Oh, geez. So
about, I want to say

477
00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:39.970
about a year ago, you
know, I pretty much focused,

478
00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:44.140
full, full time on, you
know, just making, I'll find

479
00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:48.280
her 100% better. And then
I dunno, I mean, how

480
00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:50.890
long you've followed the site,
but you can kind of

481
00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:53.350
see the progress that we've
been making over the past

482
00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:57.420
year and just revamps to
the website, making the signup

483
00:25:57.430 --> 00:26:01.180
experience a little bit better,
making the UI and the

484
00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:03.730
look and feel just, you
know, a hundred percent better

485
00:26:03.730 --> 00:26:06.970
than what it was when
we first launched. So I

486
00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:10.300
think that was one of
the things that the press

487
00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:12.850
and the notoriety and everything
was a great thing, but

488
00:26:12.850 --> 00:26:16.150
also to be honest, I
don't think we were ready

489
00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:18.430
at the time. I mean,
as far as site and

490
00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:21.670
app and all these different
things, we, we just weren't

491
00:26:21.670 --> 00:26:24.880
to that point where we
can really be proud of

492
00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:27.850
what, what was happening on
the site or within the

493
00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:31.060
app. So you did a
lot of this, if not

494
00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:33.460
all of it by yourself,
but then at some point

495
00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:37.030
you joined an accelerator, a
business accelerator called the new

496
00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:40.510
me accelerator. Why would a
startup joining an accelerator? And

497
00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:44.880
what exactly does that, does
that offer? The Accelerator was

498
00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:48.240
actually a suggestion by a
friend of mine Toby morning.

499
00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:52.320
He runs a coworking space
here in San Francisco and,

500
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:54.990
and I think it was
a good decision at the

501
00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:58.830
time because typically accelerators are
where you have an idea,

502
00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:01.620
you have kind of the
start of an idea. You

503
00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:04.500
have a proof of concept,
so to speak, and you're

504
00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:06.450
just kind of looking to
develop the idea a little

505
00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:11.040
bit more and, you know,
an accelerator provides resources in

506
00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:14.670
order for you to, you
know, make relationships and, you

507
00:27:14.670 --> 00:27:16.440
know, maybe even get in
front of a VC or

508
00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:20.460
two. This is celebrated was
really no different. We got

509
00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:24.210
to talk to a lot
of industry leading professionals, like,

510
00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:27.570
you know, the guys at
Foursquare and path, and also

511
00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:31.740
quite a few VCs and
people that have been in

512
00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:35.250
this industry for a long
time. And, and then the

513
00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:37.890
end, we just had a
demo day and, and got

514
00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:40.170
to talk to a lot
of VCs, got to visit

515
00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:43.170
Facebook and, and, and talk
to some of their engineers

516
00:27:43.170 --> 00:27:46.140
and different things like that,
that you, you really wouldn't

517
00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:48.960
have the opportunity to experience
just on your own being

518
00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:52.710
a, you know, a solo
developer. So it was a

519
00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:55.650
lot of relationship building for,
for me and my company,

520
00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:59.260
But I hear that people
who will do startups I'm

521
00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:02.330
told over and over that
you should avoid taking money

522
00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:05.690
if you can find that
to be the case as

523
00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:09.410
well. I absolutely, you know,
we, I mean, in the

524
00:28:09.410 --> 00:28:11.900
very beginning, you know, I
was doing this just off

525
00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:15.180
of the, you know, the
sweater, my brow, you know,

526
00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:17.570
I consult for a long
time and then, you know,

527
00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:20.030
dump the money back in
and, and then, you know,

528
00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:22.460
asked friends and family and,
and try to pay them

529
00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:24.710
back as soon as, and
fast as I can. And,

530
00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:27.680
and sure enough, you know,
it's pretty much worked for

531
00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:29.630
us. I mean, we raised
a little bit of capital

532
00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:34.130
early this year, but it
wasn't anything to write home

533
00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:37.820
about to be honest. So
it was just one of

534
00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:39.350
these things that it was
like, okay, we want to

535
00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:41.750
do a certain amount of
things in a certain amount

536
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:44.720
of time. Let's raise a
little bit of cash and,

537
00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:46.370
and let's just do it.
You know what I mean?

538
00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:48.380
And we'll, we'll try to
make it easy for the

539
00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:51.080
investors and the angels, and
we'll just try to pay

540
00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:53.660
them back as soon as
it can. And, and, and

541
00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:56.750
that's that. So I think
you should really avoid that

542
00:28:56.750 --> 00:29:00.350
whole discussion until you have
a valid proof of concept,

543
00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:03.920
meaning that you have customers
you're, you're, you've built this

544
00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:06.740
thing out, you're passionate about
it and, and you just

545
00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:10.580
don't see anything else, but
winning. So did you, did

546
00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:12.980
you go out with this
accelerator and just use it

547
00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:17.420
to, to build relationships? Or
did you take money that,

548
00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:19.880
that you would then use
to invest in the business?

549
00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:23.180
Oh, no, no, no, no.
So the accelerator did not

550
00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:27.560
provide any, any capital, no
startup capital whatsoever. It was

551
00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:31.460
more relationships. It was more
relationships and, you know, a

552
00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:35.510
coworking space and, you know,
a lot of mentoring as

553
00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:39.680
well from, yeah. So, so
it was, it was interesting

554
00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:42.730
though, because we didn't to
give any equity up. We,

555
00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:46.420
you know, we're basically kind
of the first experiment to

556
00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:48.490
go through this thing. So
there was just a lot

557
00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:50.830
of bonuses, you know, and
it was also for women

558
00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:54.100
and minorities. So, you know,
it was just a cause

559
00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:56.840
that I supported and a
lot of people in the

560
00:29:56.890 --> 00:29:59.920
community here in Silicon Valley,
they were like, well, you

561
00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:02.530
should, you know, this is
great. You know, that, you

562
00:30:02.530 --> 00:30:04.750
know, it was almost like
they expected me to be

563
00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:07.660
part of this thing because
of, of kind of, you

564
00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:11.310
know, our track record would
I'll find her. Do you,

565
00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:14.010
so you mentioned that you're
doing this right now in.net.

566
00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:17.430
You mentioned Azure. A lot
of people have said that

567
00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:19.830
they don't see a lot
of Microsoft folks doing anything

568
00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:22.380
in the startup space. Does
that, does that true? And

569
00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:25.260
do you find when you're
out there pitching that they

570
00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:27.540
hear, Oh, we did this
in asp.net or, Oh, we

571
00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:28.950
did this on Azure and
they go, Oh, wait a

572
00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:34.740
second. Everyone knows Microsoft only
for enterprises. Yeah. I've seen,

573
00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:37.110
I've seen a little bit
of, of all of that.

574
00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:41.670
I mean, VCs are, you
know, they don't care customers.

575
00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:45.420
They don't care either. They're
more or less like, okay,

576
00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:48.480
does this app work? Does
it work for me? Little,

577
00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:51.270
I haven't yet to meet
a user that is not

578
00:30:51.270 --> 00:30:53.910
a nerd that is saying,
what did you build it

579
00:30:53.910 --> 00:30:56.220
in? What is this? And,
you know, I mean, it

580
00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:59.280
really has, it really has
no bearing on anything. If

581
00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:03.030
you look at just our,
our app itself, the website

582
00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:06.120
it's built in complete asp.net,
but no one's picking it

583
00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:09.150
apart and saying, Hey, this
built in.net. I'm not gonna

584
00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:12.030
use it. It's, you know,
it just is kind of

585
00:31:12.030 --> 00:31:17.100
ridiculous, but there are those
people that are completely, you

586
00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:18.900
know, they're too caught up
on, you know, if you're

587
00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:21.660
developing in the hottest language,
like Ruby on rails or

588
00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:28.260
Python or dart, even, you
know, you know, it's just

589
00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:31.260
kind of elitist crap that,
you know, really doesn't matter.

590
00:31:31.290 --> 00:31:34.230
I built mine into in.net
because, you know, I love

591
00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:37.380
the language and, you know,
Microsoft, you know, has always

592
00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:39.870
made it really easy for
developers. They have a great

593
00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:43.230
ID. Everything else that I've
tried as far as ID

594
00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:46.620
is kind of, you know,
here and there, it's not,

595
00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:50.040
it's not consistent. Like you
get in visual studio, So

596
00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:51.780
it hasn't come up. I
mean, like you don't sit

597
00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:54.360
down with the VCs and
have conversations about your technology

598
00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:57.180
stack and do people care.
Cause I'm trying to get

599
00:31:57.180 --> 00:32:00.630
an understanding of why Microsoft
doesn't like factor into a

600
00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:05.370
lot of the young startups.
I think the availability and

601
00:32:05.370 --> 00:32:08.070
the ease of use is
not being played up. If,

602
00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:11.220
you know, from Microsoft saying,
well, BizSpark does a really,

603
00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:14.670
and we're part of BizSpark
as well. This spark does

604
00:32:14.670 --> 00:32:19.110
a really great job at
providing the technology. However, from

605
00:32:19.110 --> 00:32:22.080
my experience, I mean, I'm
doing all this cool stuff

606
00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:26.160
in.net and aid and Ajax
and stuff. And I'm just

607
00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:29.160
surprised that more startups are,
are not hip to it.

608
00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:31.530
I just think that Microsoft
has kind of lost that

609
00:32:31.530 --> 00:32:35.460
hip factor when it comes
to the market, the marketing

610
00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:40.610
of their, their cool, great
technologies. So, but I think

611
00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:44.150
that that can really easily
be overcome. It's not anything

612
00:32:44.150 --> 00:32:48.020
critical. Microsoft is still leading
as far as the asp.net,

613
00:32:48.050 --> 00:32:50.990
they have tons of developers,
but I think those developers

614
00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:53.090
are kind of in the
closet as that's the good

615
00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:57.440
thing. They don't want to
tell people that they're using.net.

616
00:32:58.390 --> 00:33:01.340
All right. So my last
question for you, I, I

617
00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:05.080
installed I'll find her and
it's, it doesn't have my

618
00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:07.330
town. I, it's not in,
it's not in my tiny

619
00:33:07.330 --> 00:33:11.950
town in Oregon. You've got
thousands of stores, like 3000

620
00:33:11.950 --> 00:33:14.530
or 4,000 stores. How many
stores are there and what

621
00:33:14.530 --> 00:33:16.300
kind of coverage do you
have? Cause I'm sure that

622
00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:18.430
a lot of people will
install it. Some number will

623
00:33:18.430 --> 00:33:20.590
be thrilled. And the other
number will well, I'm in

624
00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:24.790
Podunk, Oregon and my tiny
little grocery store. Isn't there.

625
00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:28.450
Yeah. That's the thing that
really sucks about, about growing

626
00:33:28.450 --> 00:33:30.430
a company like this, there's
only a few of us.

627
00:33:30.850 --> 00:33:32.170
And so we kind of
have to pick and choose

628
00:33:32.170 --> 00:33:35.560
our battles of where people
are shopping. You know, one

629
00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:39.580
thing that we've actually talked
about is, is just taking

630
00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:41.710
it on authority customers, you
know, they want to shop

631
00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:44.800
where they shop. And so
that's why we built our

632
00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:46.990
technology to where once we
do have the story, it

633
00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:50.050
will show up in inside
of our finder. So it's

634
00:33:50.050 --> 00:33:53.650
not static in that sense.
The other thing is that,

635
00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:57.010
you know, if as we
grow, we're going to start

636
00:33:57.040 --> 00:34:00.040
notifying people a little bit
more so that, you know,

637
00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:02.470
if it is their town
that they're shopping in, if

638
00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:06.070
they're in, you know, Lodi,
California or something, you know,

639
00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:08.410
we're actually going to be
there and try to really

640
00:34:08.410 --> 00:34:11.710
integrate, to make sure that
customers know we're in your

641
00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:14.350
town now. And we really
care about you. Yeah. I

642
00:34:14.350 --> 00:34:16.420
think it is a challenge.
I do have my own

643
00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:19.960
little tiny phone app. And
I've discovered that the thing

644
00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:22.750
that will keep you up
at night, feeling bad about

645
00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:26.800
yourself is the reviews. Somebody
has a bad experience and

646
00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:28.360
you don't even know why
they have a bad experience.

647
00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:30.310
And then you'll just end
up getting like, you know,

648
00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:33.940
user number 15, 25, you
know, you suck star. It's

649
00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:35.710
like, Oh, what, you know,
you want to reach out

650
00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:38.080
to that guy or call
his house. What's wrong, man.

651
00:34:39.370 --> 00:34:42.190
And, and that's, that's a
hard thing with, with developing,

652
00:34:42.220 --> 00:34:45.220
you know, the, I mean
for, you know, the app

653
00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:47.710
stores, the market and all
that is that you can't

654
00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:49.810
really reach out to these
people and say, okay, Hey

655
00:34:49.810 --> 00:34:52.060
look, you know what? I
built this thing in phone

656
00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:55.980
gap. My name is Curtis.
You know, you know, you

657
00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:58.200
know, here's the reason why
we don't have your store.

658
00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:01.120
Here's the reason why, or
what's the reason why you

659
00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:03.100
think it stops? What can
we do better? You know?

660
00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:06.250
And, and I think that
that, that kind of needs

661
00:35:06.250 --> 00:35:08.740
to be in place over
the next few years. I'm

662
00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:12.430
yet to see a startup
that really helps that process

663
00:35:12.430 --> 00:35:15.670
along by, you know, getting
feedback from people that are

664
00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:18.670
disgruntled with your apps, or
they think it sucks or

665
00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:23.050
it's, you know, lame or
whatever. Alright, last question. So

666
00:35:23.050 --> 00:35:26.170
you're not in my store,
but I feel like it

667
00:35:26.170 --> 00:35:27.940
would be cool if I
could go to my store,

668
00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:29.440
it would only take me
a little while. Cause I

669
00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:33.370
go there every week, rather
than you calling a that

670
00:35:33.370 --> 00:35:35.800
store, just let me scan
a bunch of stuff or

671
00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:38.250
take, maybe I could even
pictures of the aisle for

672
00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:41.520
you. Like, why don't you
build a street team of

673
00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:43.110
people. I just got to
walk down the aisle and

674
00:35:43.110 --> 00:35:44.910
take a picture of the
sign above the aisle, and

675
00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:47.250
then you can figure it
out from my GPS location.

676
00:35:48.570 --> 00:35:50.670
Now that idea, you know
what I mean? Just basically

677
00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:54.540
say it's kind of a
mechanical Turk thing. Yeah. Give

678
00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:58.200
me, give me a dollar
and or $2. Maybe I

679
00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:01.560
want my money and I
will walk down my aisle

680
00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:03.750
of my local store and
I'll go click, click, click,

681
00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:06.180
click, click, you'll have my
GPS and I'll give you

682
00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:09.120
30 photographs. I'll upload them.
And then your, your buddy

683
00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:12.980
can build a map from
that And see, that's not

684
00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:15.440
a bad idea. The, the
whole reason why we got

685
00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:19.040
away from crowdsourcing, the information
at the very beginning was

686
00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:21.710
because of the accuracy and
the fact that we couldn't

687
00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:24.080
scale it in the sense
that at the time it

688
00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:27.710
was only me and Jonique
our archivist, you know? So

689
00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:30.560
it wasn't like we could
call each one light. And

690
00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:32.900
that's the thing like are
now we're at the point

691
00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:34.520
where, you know, we can
really gain a lot of

692
00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:37.160
steam and users want to
do this sort of thing

693
00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:40.520
that you're talking about, where
they want to upload information,

694
00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:42.830
even if it's just for
their own personal use. So

695
00:36:43.610 --> 00:36:45.770
those are things that were
taken into account on the

696
00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:49.790
mobile side, on the, on
the website. It just hasn't

697
00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:52.970
really panned out very well.
If, if in the very

698
00:36:52.970 --> 00:36:55.250
beginning, we actually had a
way for you to upload

699
00:36:55.250 --> 00:36:58.670
information to a store, but
it just ended up being,

700
00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:02.960
you know, really bad data,
like terrible data, like people

701
00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:06.140
will put in, Oh, it's
up the street from the

702
00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:09.920
seven 11, and then they'll
put two aisles in and

703
00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:11.390
they'll say, that's all I
remember. I got to go

704
00:37:11.390 --> 00:37:14.060
back to it. You know,
I see. Yeah, that's true.

705
00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:16.910
Crowd source data is crowd
source data. Right. And you

706
00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:18.890
get what you pay for.
Yeah. But on the go,

707
00:37:18.890 --> 00:37:22.580
but it is something that
we have talked, we have

708
00:37:22.970 --> 00:37:26.000
talked about doing a mechanical
Turk team to do this

709
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.240
sort of thing, where as
a matter of fact, for

710
00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:32.450
mechanical Turk, we actually utilize
about a hundred employees of

711
00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:35.150
this call center in India.
And they're the ones that

712
00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:38.270
do the verification for us.
So two months from the

713
00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:41.900
time that you enter in
a store, they're basically calling

714
00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:44.420
back that store and seeing
if anything has changed. So,

715
00:37:44.810 --> 00:37:47.120
and we're able to do
that very, very cheaply, very

716
00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:49.970
inexpensively. And we use mechanical
Turk actually to get in

717
00:37:49.970 --> 00:37:54.320
contact with these. So, yeah.
So, so I, you know,

718
00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:56.330
and that's the thing, I,
I just see this as

719
00:37:56.780 --> 00:37:58.880
this is changing the whole
landscape of how we do

720
00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:03.200
business. I mean, I think
the whole outsourcing and offshoring

721
00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:06.830
is really gonna take off
over the next few years.

722
00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:10.610
Well, thanks for chatting with
me, Curtis. I really appreciate

723
00:38:10.610 --> 00:38:16.130
it. Thanks. Oh, I really
appreciate the opportunity. Thanks a

724
00:38:16.130 --> 00:38:20.420
lot. Ben, another episode of
Hansel minutes, we'll see you

725
00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:21.200
again next week.
