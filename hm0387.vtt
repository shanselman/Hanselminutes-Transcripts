In this episode, Scott talks

8
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:58.440
with Natasha Irizarry about lean
UX. Hi, this is Scott

9
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.450
Hanselman. This is another episode
of Hansel minutes. I'm down

10
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.000
here in Jacksonville, Florida at
code on the beach. I'm

11
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.720
talking with UX strategists, Natasha
Erie, Erie. How are you?

12
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.730
I'm good. How are you?
I'm very well. You did

13
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.350
a good talk on, on
lean UX. Yeah, that sounds

14
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.120
like three buzzwords to me.
Three lean user and experience

15
00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.910
UX is two words, but
I'm just saying like you

16
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.120
all UX, I guess is
one thing, but, and I'm

17
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.210
not disrespecting your, your industry,
but I have to say

18
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.360
from the developer's perspective where
output is measured in lines

19
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.380
of code and number DLLs
shipped and number, but it's

20
00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.230
like, well, what's the UX
person do. They're just mostly

21
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:41.990
hanging around in Photoshop, Sort
of, not really since solve

22
00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.760
it for me. So user
experience design or whatever you

23
00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.770
want to call it is
the idea of making a

24
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.760
tool. Not feel like a
tool. So when you're on

25
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.980
your phone, it doesn't feel
like you're on your phone.

26
00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:01.580
It's like, especially us iPhones.
It it's her calendar. It's

27
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.710
your photo gallery. It's it's
your black book. And it's

28
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.860
interesting because growing up, my
dad had this black book

29
00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.970
of, he had pictures of,
of us, me and my

30
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.740
sisters, his, you know, events.
And he would haul this

31
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.430
giant thing everywhere. And now,
like I do the same

32
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.980
thing, but it's on my
phone. That was like a

33
00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.790
bit, it was his PDA.
Yeah. It was a giant

34
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.250
black book. Stan's a wallet.
Yes, yes, yes. And, and

35
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.550
so UX is the idea
of creating something that doesn't

36
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.070
feel like you're using anything,
right. When did the name

37
00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.320
UX come out? I think
the last four or five

38
00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.050
years we went from user
interface designers that did buttons

39
00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.030
stuff. And now it's like
experience. Yeah. I, I'm not

40
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:56.780
sure. I'm not sure when
it became called UX. I

41
00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.730
learned about it. I didn't
even know I was doing

42
00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.190
it. And, and someone asked
me earlier, how do you

43
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.070
learn how to do UX?
And like, I just don't

44
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.460
feel like it can be
taught. Can you get a

45
00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.880
human computer interaction degree? I
know people with PhDs and

46
00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.650
HCI. Yeah. But I, I
think a lot of UX

47
00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.600
people have degrees in like
psychology, which is interesting because

48
00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.350
we're, we're, we're really understanding
humans and how they work

49
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.740
and how they navigate through.
Like, if it's a web,

50
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.930
like a website and applying
that into our designs. And

51
00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.450
There's a, there's a great
book. I think it's Donald Norman

52
00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.150
who has the design of
everyday thing. Yes. I love

53
00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.750
that book. I love that
book. That there's, there's also

54
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.760
a book called design yourself.
Okay. I can't remember who

55
00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.610
wrote it, but it's, it's
Awesome. I will add links

56
00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.340
in the show notes for
people who are listening design

57
00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.620
of everyday things has this
picture of a teapot on

58
00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.990
the outside. And I think
it's in that book where

59
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.320
he talks about the, like,
we're looking at this door

60
00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.670
right now. You and I
are in this room and

61
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.520
there's this door. And it's
got the, the bar across

62
00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:13.290
that, The satisfying click of
things, cabinets that closed. Someone

63
00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.660
told me that they designed
that once. Like that's how

64
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.050
they said what they did.
And I was like, well,

65
00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.620
I know use that forever.
Yeah. This bar here. Apparently

66
00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.760
if you put the bar
in the middle centered, people

67
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.430
will shove it in the
middle and struggle to open

68
00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.620
the door because of where
the hinges. But if you

69
00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.440
put it off to one
side, it makes you want

70
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.270
to push it in the
center of that bar, which

71
00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.750
then causes the door to
open. Yeah. And also on

72
00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.990
the topic of doors and
their usability, the doors had

73
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.730
always had the hand, the
handle on both sides, but

74
00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.800
they only go one way
and they don't say pusher

75
00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.950
pool just yet. That's like
a huge door usability problem

76
00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:52.620
That at work every day
and everyday I do it

77
00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.760
wrong. I want to pull
on the handle and want

78
00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.610
to push on the button.
Yeah. I hate it when

79
00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.310
you have to grab a
handle and then push forward.

80
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.090
That makes no sense. That
makes no sense. Yeah. Interesting.

81
00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.480
Okay. So, but you are
also a web designer and

82
00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.260
I do do those things
always go together. No, I,

83
00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:16.200
I guess maybe seven years
ago I would have defined

84
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.550
myself as a web designer
or a visual designer, but

85
00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.810
UX is so much more
than that. It's taking, it's

86
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:30.390
planning everything out of reading,
usability tests, being involved in

87
00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:37.200
testing, really understanding the product
and the customers are people

88
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:43.530
who do users and making
it good for them. It's

89
00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:48.300
less about the business and
more about the user. And,

90
00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:51.150
and I will always fight
for the user. It feels

91
00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.220
like a lot of times
I'm, I'm the devil's advocate

92
00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.890
of every meeting I'm in.
Cause they're like, we need

93
00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:58.010
to meet these numbers. Like,
well, you're not going to

94
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.110
do that cause no one's
gonna use it. They're not

95
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.650
gonna think that click there
do this. It's interesting. I

96
00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:05.080
was going to kind of
guess the opposite because the

97
00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.720
user experience person sure needs
to make a great experience

98
00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.360
for the user. But if
the point is to take

99
00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.240
money from the user, let's
say that you're designing a

100
00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.000
shopping cart and checkout process.
It has to be an

101
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
awesome experience. And it has
to satisfy both. The user

102
00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:22.150
feels like no money was
taken. Like it was just

103
00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.880
this effortless experience and the
business who was going to

104
00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.040
look at numbers like conversions.
And they're going to say,

105
00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:31.280
Hey, your last design converted
5% more. It's interesting. I

106
00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:34.150
I've, I've worked in financial
services for a while now,

107
00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:37.630
like eight, eight or nine
years. And at one of

108
00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:40.360
the places I worked, we,
we got, we got to

109
00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.750
test everything and which a
lot of places you, you

110
00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:46.630
don't, you can't do that.
But at this specific place,

111
00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:50.380
we were testing rates on
banners. So like a rate

112
00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:54.760
for like a savings account.
Right. So the good rates,

113
00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.310
right? You the, the higher,
the rate, the more money

114
00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:01.810
you'll make eventually. And we
had these banners and one

115
00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:03.370
of them had to write
and one of them didn't,

116
00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:10.360
they just had copy and
text. Yeah. And 66% more

117
00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:13.720
like conversions from the one
that did not have a

118
00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:20.170
right. Real 66%. And Yeah,
like as a techie, I

119
00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:23.260
want to know numbers. Yes.
And that's what you would

120
00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.020
think. But our brain is
like trained to just ignore

121
00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:29.110
like those big, giant numbers
in our face, I guess,

122
00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:32.860
like ad blocking or whatever.
We just ignore it. And

123
00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:36.520
to go with that, we
also tested, like, learn more

124
00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:41.560
buttons versus learn more text,
like copy, like inline texts,

125
00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:46.270
the learn more text, always
got more clicks, Always versus

126
00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:49.150
like an entire paragraph. Yeah.
With like a little like

127
00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:53.890
blue learn, more link. Really.
Yep. Got more clicks, like

128
00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:57.850
double more clicks than a
button. Good morning, because I'm

129
00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:02.230
actually in the process of
redesigning our asp.net website and

130
00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:04.900
they've added a bunch of
these blue learn more buttons.

131
00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:09.730
And that's interesting. I wonder
if it's because text links

132
00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:12.790
are kind of passive and
nonthreatening. Cause I think this

133
00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:14.860
is interesting to dig into
the psychology of this. So

134
00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:16.300
I'm guessing when you tell
him what you think. Yeah.

135
00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:18.880
Like text links, I click
on all the time and

136
00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:22.630
they don't indicate an action.
They indicate an interest to

137
00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:26.980
learn more about something at
CNN or some news article,

138
00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:31.030
but a button indicates a
certain amount of intent. There's

139
00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:33.970
a certain amount of strength
required to express one's intent.

140
00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:37.990
So pushing a button is
psychologically more difficult than clicking

141
00:08:38.410 --> 00:08:41.230
links. Yeah. And you got
to think about marketing. Like

142
00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:45.670
everyone hates marketing, but everyone
loves marketing. Right? Like I

143
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:48.640
know someone that says he
hates marketing, he hates it.

144
00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:50.920
But if you look at
him, like you can see

145
00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:55.410
his like Lacoste shirt with
his, I don't know, fancy

146
00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:59.250
seven jeans or whatever. And
his Nike's like, you hate

147
00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:03.950
marketing, but you are, You
are you're walking, marketing. Exactly.

148
00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:09.320
Like, and people want to
hate marketing, but any kind

149
00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.030
of button that I click
on on the internet is

150
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:14.240
being tracked. Everything's being tracked.
So, which is crazy to

151
00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:18.830
think about, but it is.
And it's just crazy to

152
00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:22.010
see these numbers on, on
the sign or spend all

153
00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:25.940
this time making these fancy
buttons for what like, and,

154
00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:30.350
and that gets into the
conversation of the like form

155
00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:33.290
over function. Right. So like
if it's not functional, what's

156
00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:37.580
the point. So why spend,
you know, three hours designing

157
00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:39.590
this impressive button when you
can just put it In

158
00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:42.830
text? Yeah. Yeah. I worked
in financial services. We talked

159
00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:45.830
a little bit about this
before for, for gosh, nine

160
00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:49.910
years, I did retail online
banking. So like logging in,

161
00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:52.580
checking your balance and stuff
like that. And then also

162
00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:54.980
integration with QuickBooks and money
and things like that. So

163
00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:58.070
my stuff was not the
homepage of the bank, but

164
00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:01.880
it was balances, bill payment,
money transfers, stuff like that.

165
00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:05.780
And we would get into
these arguments with the bankers

166
00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:09.830
about like, is this rule,
this line one pixel wide

167
00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:12.620
or three pixels wide. And
they would fight with the

168
00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:16.160
designer. And I was always
like, that means nothing. It

169
00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.040
changes nothing. No one is
going to either use or

170
00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:22.040
not use the product based
on that rule. So the

171
00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:24.170
shoe, I always said that
the suit should really be

172
00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:26.660
focusing on what the functionality
is and if the designer

173
00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:29.810
wants a one pixel rule
and we trust that designer,

174
00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:31.490
let them do it. I
mean, is that a good,

175
00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:36.290
Yeah. I mean, I want
to say, because I'm a

176
00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:39.890
designer that the designer always
knows best, But well, if

177
00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:42.050
they're a good designer, Well,
no, if they're a good

178
00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:45.740
designer, they'll listen to everyone
and then make an informed

179
00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:50.180
decision based on that. I
mean, that's what, that's what

180
00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:51.860
I do whenever I'm in
a meeting, I'm usually the

181
00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:55.070
last person that talks because
I really want to understand

182
00:10:55.130 --> 00:11:00.110
like example, like a pixel
rule, take the, take it

183
00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:01.940
away. If it's that big
of a deal, don't put

184
00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:05.240
it at all. Like, and
that's, that's how I look

185
00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:08.810
at problems like that. It's
designers are not artists like,

186
00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:11.330
and, and that's a big
confusion, right? I think that

187
00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:14.030
there's probably designers right now
who just like got upset

188
00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:17.990
and they're looking at their
podcast signers or not, They

189
00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:21.710
are not. And, and this
is, this is, this is

190
00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:24.970
going to get a lot
of bad feedback, but I'm

191
00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:29.270
a firm believer that designers
are problem solvers and artists

192
00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:33.350
are problem causers. So, and
not in a negative way.

193
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:36.200
Cause I do, I do
art. I will paint whatever

194
00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:43.250
I do crafts. I love
Pinterest, but designers, I look

195
00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:45.980
at everything like it's math.
I put everything on a

196
00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:49.880
grid. Every design decision that
I make is, is a

197
00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:53.950
decision that I make. If,
if there is pixel rule

198
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.270
and it doesn't need to
be there, then I won't

199
00:11:55.270 --> 00:12:01.690
put it there. Every, every
choice is intentional, but art

200
00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:04.390
like, and let me, let
me finish that before going

201
00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:10.870
to art, when, how design
and art meet is after

202
00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:14.950
all those design decisions are
made and you want to

203
00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:18.520
give your user a feeling
you want to invoke a

204
00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:22.000
feeling it's like Apple in
those commercials or Google and

205
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.600
those commercials. Gosh, like there
was one super bowl commercial

206
00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:29.560
for Chrome about like proposing
in Paris. And I will

207
00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:33.580
never forget it. Or like
there was one where a

208
00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:37.510
father wrote emails to his
daughter and it was so

209
00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:40.840
good. And if you look
at it, it is probably

210
00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:42.940
some designer and an art
director. And it took him

211
00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:45.790
like a couple of days
to make probably like no

212
00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:48.970
money at all, really. But
it's, it, it hits, it

213
00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:52.150
impacts you so hard. So
is that artistry or design?

214
00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:55.330
That's where art hits design.
That's where, that's where it

215
00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:58.510
collides. But as far as,
as far as art goes,

216
00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:03.460
art is purely like emotion
is purely feel emotion. It's

217
00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:09.310
not, it's not really problem-solving
right. Yeah. So the difference

218
00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:11.550
between art and design, I
think, Let me see if

219
00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:13.740
I understand that paraphrase. So
we don't get like angry

220
00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:16.500
letters here. Don't get don't.
You can, you can tweet

221
00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:19.140
me angry, angry things. That's
okay. I think I understand.

222
00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:22.500
So what I'm hearing you
say is that if you

223
00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:26.040
are saying I'm in hardest,
your job is to express

224
00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:28.730
yourself to a Voke emotion
and other people. And to

225
00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:31.230
get that art out of
you, and it may not

226
00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:32.760
have a purpose. You may
not have a form or

227
00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:35.790
function. It may just be,
Hey, it's art. And then

228
00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:38.850
a designer though is like
a programmer in the sense

229
00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:42.720
of I'm designing for a
purpose for an explicit reason,

230
00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:45.330
either to get them to
enter their credit card or

231
00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:47.220
get them to click this
button or to make it

232
00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:49.380
so that they can check
their email on an iPhone

233
00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:53.640
Or even even take it
out of web completely interstate

234
00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:59.370
signs. I love signage. I
love more than anything going

235
00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:01.950
to like a real city.
And when I say real

236
00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:04.710
estate, I mean like my
favorite city ever Boston, like

237
00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:07.500
looking at the, like the
map for the T. Yeah.

238
00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:10.890
It like stops my heart
every time. It's it's incredible.

239
00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:16.680
And the train the T
T yeah, the T Oh,

240
00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:19.230
I see you like the,
sorry. I like the train.

241
00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:21.920
I love subways. Do you
like the subway maps that

242
00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:24.390
people are always redoing in
New York? Every designer has to

243
00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:27.240
do that. Yes. The tumbler,
the tumbler. God, I love

244
00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:28.590
charts. Yeah. You have to
send me a link to

245
00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:30.870
this. This is a tumbler
of just yeah. Yes. And

246
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:35.670
there's also a Tumblr. I
love charts.tumblr.com. Okay. So good.

247
00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:39.930
It's so I love charts,
so it's good. It's like

248
00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:42.480
math. I love it. I
love design because it's like

249
00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:46.380
math and I wouldn't consider
myself like a math genius,

250
00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:52.880
but it really is you,
you have this, that is

251
00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:57.050
from the business or whoever
or client and they tell

252
00:14:57.050 --> 00:15:02.420
you the solution, but it's,
it's, it's the pieces of

253
00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:06.560
the, I guess, algorithm or
problem or whatever that make

254
00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:10.070
that solution. That, that makes
the solution so good. Right.

255
00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:15.500
So like for our website
it's it's and I'm going

256
00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:17.150
to get into the response
of talk a little bit.

257
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:20.660
I am a firm believer
that creativity is not device

258
00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:23.570
dependent is not, it shouldn't
matter if you are on

259
00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:26.750
your phone, on your tablet,
on your desktop, you should

260
00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:29.540
have the same experience. You
should be giving those same

261
00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:32.830
emotions. So you're a pro
responsive design. It sounds like

262
00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:36.730
Yes. For the right cases.
Yeah. Like an example I

263
00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:38.280
gave is I'm actually going
to go talk on mobile.

264
00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:40.810
Yeah. Yeah. I'm excited. I'm
excited for that. Hopefully it

265
00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:43.360
doesn't suck. I hope it
won't. I'm sure. One of

266
00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:45.220
the things I don't like
is when I, like, I

267
00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:47.380
have this friend who has
a, and I need to

268
00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:48.910
bug her about this, I'm
going to call her out

269
00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:51.850
her name's Lovie. We do
it a talk show together

270
00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:56.050
on my other podcast. And
she, all of her blogs

271
00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:00.010
evoke emotion. They use red
and bright colors and she

272
00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:02.650
loves shoes. So there's always
like red and shoes. I

273
00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:05.410
love shoes. But in the
old days, when you went

274
00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:08.500
to her blog, you got
this generic WP touch kind

275
00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:11.890
of like WordPress fake mobile
site. So then I told

276
00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:13.810
her to get rid of
that, but now her site

277
00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:17.290
has an ad across the
top that is so wide

278
00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:21.430
that it's forcing the width
of the entire site. So

279
00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:23.890
you just have a horrible
experience on mobile. And I

280
00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:27.160
really feel like minimal amount
of work would bring that

281
00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:32.260
bright, red, emotional fun look
to the device. But because

282
00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:35.260
she didn't go that last
step. Yeah. I wonder if

283
00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.570
she could kill the ad
on mobile or to make

284
00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:40.720
it tiny or yeah. I
mean, whatever, you don't need

285
00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:42.250
an ad on mobile. Yeah.
But when I work with

286
00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:44.620
my designer, who did my
blog, it's funny that you

287
00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:47.110
talk about the difference between
form and function and emotion

288
00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:50.020
versus trying to solve a
problem. I sat down and

289
00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:52.030
I said, you know, I
want it to be earthy

290
00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:55.240
and organic and beige, but
not boring, kind of beige.

291
00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:57.850
And I told them all
the emotions I wanted, but

292
00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:00.190
then I also said, I
wasn't interested in page views.

293
00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:02.770
I was interested in comments.
So he made the comment

294
00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:06.850
bubble bigger and the comment
link brighter. So he met

295
00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:11.680
those, those requirements of making
it art or artsy and

296
00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:15.280
artsy. It was effectively art,
but it also was incredibly

297
00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:19.750
functional. Yeah. And, and it's,
it's funny. It's a lot

298
00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:23.560
of like mind trickery. I
feel like, I feel like

299
00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:26.260
I come across that a
lot in, in, in my

300
00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:28.930
line of work is, is
we have to make people

301
00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:32.410
feel these emotions. And like
how, how do you do

302
00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:36.520
that? You use colors, like
color theory. Funny, funny thing.

303
00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:40.570
I did my senior thesis
on color theory and the

304
00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:44.170
psychology behind color. And do
you want, do you know

305
00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:48.190
what color is bought more
than any other color? Like

306
00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:54.290
this color, everyone will buy,
right? Tiffany blue. So what

307
00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:56.090
a Tiffany is like a
sky blue or what? So

308
00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:59.930
it's like a greenish bluish
turquoise. Yeah. No, that's such

309
00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:03.230
a gross. It's not, it's
not my nails. My toenails

310
00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:08.030
are that color. Well, you
can't. Yeah. But like they

311
00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:10.340
it's really. Yeah. That's the
color. Yep. Now I'm going

312
00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:11.600
to have to go look
and see if I've bought

313
00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:14.180
those things. Yeah. Go look
around your house. I guarantee

314
00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:17.540
you. It's not like somebody's
phone green. It's no, that's,

315
00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:21.110
it's a little less obnoxious.
I'll show you. Yeah. People

316
00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:26.270
like blue people like blue
people and like, not like

317
00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:29.780
Navy blue, but like this
fun blue. And I actually

318
00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:31.610
got to test this at
one of the paintings I

319
00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:34.310
worked at. And I'll tell
you what they love that

320
00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:37.850
blue really. And their main
color was, You know, I

321
00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:40.190
went to a blog recently
that was linked to me

322
00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:41.900
on Twitter. And as soon
as I got there, it

323
00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:44.600
was white text on a
black background, looked like the

324
00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:47.210
nineties and I didn't have
the heart to tell the

325
00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:50.990
guy. I mean, how do
you say I love your

326
00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:53.750
content? I think it would
be more effective if you

327
00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:56.270
inverted your colors, you just
tell him really. You don't

328
00:18:56.270 --> 00:19:00.410
think he'd be offended. No,
I, yeah, you should. Because

329
00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:03.740
I, I just couldn't see
myself ever going back. So

330
00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:06.560
yeah. And I, I'm kind
of, I'm kind of heartless

331
00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:08.870
about this stuff because a
long time ago I took

332
00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:12.380
my ego out of it.
Like when, when, as a

333
00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:17.090
designer, it's not, it's not
about you. Right. And maybe

334
00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:20.180
that's going back to like
art versus design. It's not

335
00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:22.940
about you. It's not about
Coders. So many times there's

336
00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:25.670
a kind of coder that
takes it personally. Like you

337
00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:32.750
are not your for-loop. Yes,
exactly. And as, as designer,

338
00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:35.960
like, and I mentioned this
in my talk yesterday, like

339
00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:40.010
fail, like do not be
afraid to fail, embrace it.

340
00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:42.980
And I, and there's a
quote, I don't know where

341
00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:46.370
it came from, but it's
make better mistakes tomorrow. And

342
00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:50.240
I live by that. I,
I, I had a great

343
00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:54.570
mentor through college and he
said to me once, do

344
00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:57.770
you need to stop worrying
about today and start worrying

345
00:19:57.770 --> 00:20:02.340
about next week tomorrow, next
week, next month? Like, like

346
00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:06.110
when you, when you make
design design decisions, don't just

347
00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:09.230
do it for what's good.
Now do it for what's

348
00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:14.330
good later as well. And
that, that changed everything they

349
00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:18.200
did. And so now I
pay closer attention to the

350
00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:21.830
design. Does the design decisions
that I make. Yeah. I've

351
00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:24.110
noticed that we've got some
designs that we're putting out

352
00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:27.170
for the ESPN net site,
for example. And we've noticed

353
00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:29.930
that they don't work well
on touch devices. Like there's

354
00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:33.140
hover States to get menus,
to drop down. And we

355
00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:36.080
just never thought about that,
This, but so now on,

356
00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:40.580
on like tablet devices, there's
going to be like hover

357
00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:45.110
States. Like, and, and huh,
Like he used to touch

358
00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:49.000
it or you can't move
your finger, but the capacitive

359
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.740
screen doesn't know you're hovering
yet. Oh yes. So, and

360
00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:55.860
I've read blogs about this
and, and someone on Twitter,

361
00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:58.950
I can't remember who it
was, but they, they mentioned

362
00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:03.300
this and it's Y type
or use a mouse when

363
00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:06.810
you can use voice or
gestures. Oh, absolutely. And I

364
00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:10.440
love that. I love it.
Like it's so right. Like,

365
00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:13.260
and, and I was reading,
I was reading your blog

366
00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:16.440
about this and it had
those like minority report screenshots.

367
00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:22.590
Yeah. Like that. I got
a very bifurcated response. Everyone

368
00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:24.480
was like, yes. Right on.
That's exactly what I felt

369
00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:26.550
when I got it. I
haven't used it. But then

370
00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:29.280
I got a lot of
responses from developers of the

371
00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:31.290
leap motion who used it
that are like, well, you

372
00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:33.810
know, you have to walk
before you can run. And

373
00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:35.340
you know, you can't, don't
pick on a baby. He's

374
00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:37.950
just a baby, but he'll
learn. Yeah. I mean, well,

375
00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:40.920
I bought the thing for
retail price and it came

376
00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:45.660
boxed. I expected a retail
experience. Well, I mean, yes,

377
00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:49.530
but you know, in those
developers defense, they've probably been

378
00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:52.130
working on that for awhile.
I know it's there, but

379
00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:54.840
it's their baby. I've heard
directly from the leap motion

380
00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:56.130
people. But I heard from
lots of people that are

381
00:21:56.130 --> 00:22:00.270
doing stuff, like make developing
for it. Third party developers.

382
00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:03.360
Yeah. And everyone's like, well,
you're being too harsh. And

383
00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:07.740
my only argument was, I
don't think so Hyped up

384
00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:11.220
that product so much. Yeah.
You know what I mean?

385
00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:13.830
And then when they tell
me that it can see

386
00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:17.760
one, 100th of a millimeter.
Yeah. Well then you sure

387
00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:20.670
about to be able to
see me wave. Yeah. And

388
00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:23.790
that was very frustrating. Yeah.
I mean, I have not

389
00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:27.000
experienced that. I have a
friend who was like waiting

390
00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:29.100
at best buy for it
to come out. He like

391
00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:30.990
tried to get it on
Friday. They wouldn't let them

392
00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:32.820
the eight or wait until
Sunday. I heard about it

393
00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:34.530
for like a week. It
was crazy. And what happened?

394
00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:36.630
I don't know. I never
asked him what he thought,

395
00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:40.710
but I honestly, honestly, I
just, I just forgot about

396
00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:43.470
it. I know, because is
he totally disappointed and sad

397
00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:45.150
and take it back? I
have no idea. He hasn't

398
00:22:45.150 --> 00:22:46.680
told me, but I have
a feeling if it was

399
00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:48.690
a good experience, he would
have been like, this is

400
00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:51.180
incredible. But if it was
a terrible experience, you've been

401
00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:54.540
like, this is horrible. See,
the thing about that interaction

402
00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:56.580
model was that they were
trying to tell us that

403
00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:58.710
it would, it could see
your fingers and it can

404
00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:01.710
see you down to the
millimeter. And I expected intense

405
00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:04.290
accuracy. But what I'm realizing
is I don't want that.

406
00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:08.460
I want course gesture recognition.
There's a, there's an app

407
00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:11.580
that's in beta right now
on windows 8.1. I just

408
00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:14.580
upgraded my, my little surface
thing. It's a little portable.

409
00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:16.620
I know what that was
until like a day ago,

410
00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:19.170
windows 8.1 or a surface
surface. So it's like an

411
00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:23.220
iPad it's windows I found.
Okay. So the windows eight

412
00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:27.150
is pretty unpolished and it's
kind of rough windows. 8.1

413
00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:30.900
is 0.1 better. And it's
way better. It just brings

414
00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:32.970
the whole thing to life.
It's like when the first

415
00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:37.170
iPad I phone was amazing,
but you know, they had

416
00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:41.460
problems. They iterated. So anyway,
this is app, that's the

417
00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:45.290
recipe app. Okay. So you
put your surface and has

418
00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:47.990
like a little kickstand and
any story and the way

419
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:50.270
that you move to the
next recipe or the next

420
00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:52.490
step in the recipe is
you just wave your hand

421
00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:56.890
in front of, Because I
use, I use my iPad

422
00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:59.650
a lot. I use it
for recipes all the time

423
00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:02.170
for recipes, especially. And you
know what I hate when

424
00:24:02.170 --> 00:24:04.600
I'm like covered in like
flour and butter and egg.

425
00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:08.410
And like, I have to
touch my iPad. I like

426
00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:11.260
try it with my elbow.
Actually I've done it with

427
00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:15.880
my nose apps. You're absolutely
right. That gets, sounds like

428
00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:18.310
a silly use case. But
once you have cooked with

429
00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:20.650
a tablet next to you,
you can't do recipes any

430
00:24:20.650 --> 00:24:24.280
other way. Exactly. My point
calling back to the leap

431
00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:26.980
motion is I don't care
that you can see my

432
00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:29.350
fingers to down to the
millimeter, but I do care

433
00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:31.030
is that if I go
like this and move my

434
00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:34.360
hand from right to left
quickly, it clearly means next

435
00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:37.240
page. Yes. And some people
might do it with their

436
00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:39.700
hand out. Some people might
do it like a wave.

437
00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:42.850
If I have to write
the code to like detect

438
00:24:42.850 --> 00:24:44.830
all the different ways that
someone might do that, then

439
00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:48.010
that's way too much detail
question. Okay. What about other

440
00:24:48.010 --> 00:24:52.090
languages that don't read that,
Right? Right. Yeah. Then I

441
00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:54.010
should totally like, yeah. If
I'm Arabic or Hebrew, I

442
00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:57.340
should wipe that the other
way. Yeah. But my point

443
00:24:57.340 --> 00:25:02.290
is that the leap motion
required you to be precise

444
00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:06.760
in what is ultimately a
gross motor motion. Yeah. Well,

445
00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:08.920
in this particular example, and
this is a super fine

446
00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:10.510
example, I'm not in any
way trying to say the

447
00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:12.640
surface is comparable to a
leap motion. Yeah. I'm saying

448
00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:16.120
this one app turns the
web cam on and I'm

449
00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:19.390
sure if I ran quickly
past it, like not using

450
00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:21.370
my artists, just to my
head to shut, you know

451
00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:22.630
what I mean? It would
probably go to the next

452
00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:25.510
recipe. I'm imagining that. Right.
Because the coder just wrote

453
00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:29.410
some basic basic thing. That's
like some large object goes

454
00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:32.230
from side to side. That's
what I want. Like I

455
00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:34.780
want to be on my,
on my Mac or my

456
00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:37.420
PC and then just kind
of flipped my arm up

457
00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:40.870
in a flippant motion. And
that would scroll. Yeah. But

458
00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:42.760
I don't want to have
to like, hold my finger

459
00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:46.720
precisely or two fingers out.
And then yeah. It's like,

460
00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:50.640
that reminds me of like
the tap radius on, on

461
00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:56.890
like phones, how like some
websites using tap, tap, tap,

462
00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:01.030
how there'll be like this
tiny little X that you

463
00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:03.850
need to hit. But, and
Apple does this too. They

464
00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:06.010
had this tiny little thing,
but they don't even follow

465
00:26:06.010 --> 00:26:08.620
their own standards of like
a 44 by 44 tap

466
00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:11.050
radius. They just have this
tiny little text that you

467
00:26:11.050 --> 00:26:12.850
have to tap. What does
that mean? That's the, that's

468
00:26:12.850 --> 00:26:15.490
the, I touched with the
tip of my finger and

469
00:26:15.490 --> 00:26:18.520
I was off and you
just figure I'm within 50.

470
00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:22.360
So Yeah. It's like a,
like, thank the Lord for

471
00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:26.740
auto. Correct. Are you kidding
me? Right? Yeah. So like

472
00:26:26.770 --> 00:26:30.820
you mistype everything and if
it wasn't for auto, correct.

473
00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:34.570
Sometimes auto-correct is not good.
I got halfway through the

474
00:26:34.570 --> 00:26:36.460
word. I know I'm wrong.
I go, it better. Figure

475
00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:38.440
it out. I do that.
I do that too. And

476
00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:41.020
then, and then it doesn't
and you're like white and

477
00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:43.500
then, Well then it's even
worse when the horribly word

478
00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:47.850
gets into your dictionary. Yes,
I do. I, my friends

479
00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:52.110
and I, we have like
nicknames for everyone and there's

480
00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:57.870
one person that we call
Davy Saurus okay. And his

481
00:26:57.870 --> 00:27:01.500
name, Davy source is in
all of our auto-corrects awesome.

482
00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:03.840
So as soon as we
start to type like DAV,

483
00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:06.690
no matter what it is,
it all automatically goes to

484
00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:09.240
David source. I'm like, no,
now I have to backspace

485
00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:11.420
all of that. I have
the exact same problem. I

486
00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:14.330
might, we talk to my
wife's family, half in English

487
00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:16.190
and half in an end
to belly, which is her

488
00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:19.130
Zuni based language. And it
has these ridiculous words with

489
00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:23.000
like 50 is confidence and
stuff. And anytime I, anytime

490
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.190
I have like a Z
or a G, it just

491
00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:28.460
assumes one of these obscure
words and it just explodes.

492
00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:31.480
Yeah. And then that's a
lousy experience. That's a lousy

493
00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:34.040
experience. One of the other
things that I thought was

494
00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:37.220
interesting about you is that
you run the Jacksonville user

495
00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:40.400
experience group. So you're a
community leader. We would call

496
00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:43.460
you that. Right. But that's
not as interesting as the

497
00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:46.340
fact that you go to
other user groups. Yeah. I,

498
00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:50.660
I am super involved in
the community. I, yeah, I

499
00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:54.710
go to about 25 a
month, sometimes more than one

500
00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:59.870
a night. I feel like
I noticed that in Jacksonville,

501
00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:03.620
especially, there's not a lot
of like UX people or

502
00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:05.780
they know what UX is,
but they don't think that

503
00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:07.250
they can do it because
they think it's only for

504
00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:11.090
designers. And I don't think
that at all. I think

505
00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:15.620
that that UX is everyone
working together, whether it's project

506
00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:20.690
managers, whether it's like copywriters,
devs, any kind of dev,

507
00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:23.930
I love the majority of
our group consists of developers,

508
00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:30.260
which is interesting because I
feel like our, our careers

509
00:28:30.290 --> 00:28:33.920
are, are forcing us all
to be hybrids. So as

510
00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:38.090
a UX designer or strategist
or whatever, whatever I am,

511
00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:40.610
I feel like I have
to have a knowledge of

512
00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.810
all of these different like
programming languages or at least

513
00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:46.940
have like the basic fundamentals
of them. So I can,

514
00:28:47.210 --> 00:28:49.280
so I can work with
those people and design with

515
00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:55.100
those people and specifically say
with, and not for, I'm

516
00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:58.340
not designing for developers and
designing for users, but I'm

517
00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:02.750
designing with the developers. And
I feel like going out

518
00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:07.430
to these community events, it
shows them that I'm serious.

519
00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:12.080
Like I want that. I
want to know their specific

520
00:29:12.530 --> 00:29:15.470
things, whether it's I go
to the big data, meet

521
00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:18.650
up here and it's way
out of my league. Like

522
00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:22.520
these guys are incredibly smart,
but I will go and

523
00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:23.690
I will sit there and
I will, and I will

524
00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:27.080
try to understand, I'll ask
questions and, and really like

525
00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:30.170
dig into what it is
so I can understand it

526
00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:34.960
so I can design for
it. And the community. I

527
00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:37.460
was like this in Charlotte
too. Charlotte has an amazing

528
00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:41.860
tech community. But here, when
I first started UX, which

529
00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:45.520
was a year ago, our
first meetup had eight people,

530
00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:48.250
four of whom I like
begged. I was like, you

531
00:29:48.250 --> 00:29:52.960
have to come. Now we
average about 50 people a

532
00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:58.630
month. We have 210 members,
220 members. And it's because,

533
00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:01.270
and I've, haven't really like
marketed it. I've just gone

534
00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:04.450
out to these community events
and opened up to people.

535
00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:07.180
And a lot of people,
a lot of people in

536
00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:10.090
our field are they're introverts.
And I'm guilty of being

537
00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:14.650
an introvert sometimes too. But
I, I really like pull

538
00:30:14.650 --> 00:30:16.600
them over to me and
say, Hey, let's build this

539
00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:20.140
community. And when I first
started, someone said to me,

540
00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:22.990
it'll be interesting to see
how this goes, because this

541
00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:25.330
has been started before, but
people just give up. Right.

542
00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:28.370
And now I'm like a
year into it. And we're

543
00:30:28.390 --> 00:30:30.730
growing every day, every day,
like two or three people

544
00:30:30.730 --> 00:30:35.710
join. And it's incredible to
see. And just, just the

545
00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:38.380
fact to like, let people
know that like, it's okay,

546
00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:40.960
that you're not a designer
because it's not about design.

547
00:30:41.410 --> 00:30:45.160
It's not. What's about, it's
about finding different ways to

548
00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:50.260
solve problems. Whether it's in,
I had someone talk on

549
00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:56.530
angular versus knockout, which is
a great turnout. I have

550
00:30:56.530 --> 00:31:02.680
talked about persona creation. I
have some JavaScript, people come

551
00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:06.190
out and it's fun. It's,
it's a great, it's a

552
00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:08.760
great time. Well, what do
you say to the developers

553
00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:11.010
who have never been to
a user group at all?

554
00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:13.290
They just like, it's Hey,
it's five. I punch out.

555
00:31:13.290 --> 00:31:15.720
Yeah. I actually talked to
one today. He was like,

556
00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:18.440
this is my first conference
ever. And I, I don't,

557
00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:20.820
I'm not really involved in
the community. I'm like, I

558
00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:24.960
tell them if you want
to succeed, then come out

559
00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:27.690
to these groups. And I
feel like the thing that

560
00:31:27.690 --> 00:31:31.020
drives all of us all,
like whether we're designers or

561
00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:35.400
developers to these events is
that we all have this

562
00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:40.530
shared feeling of we're not
okay with just being okay.

563
00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:45.210
And, and we have to
be good. We were passionate

564
00:31:45.210 --> 00:31:47.790
and you can see it,
like just walking out there.

565
00:31:47.790 --> 00:31:51.060
All these people are so
passionate. They're, they're taking the

566
00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:54.450
most valuable thing in the
world, which is time to

567
00:31:54.450 --> 00:31:58.770
come and see us talk.
And, and it's incredible. It's

568
00:31:58.770 --> 00:32:01.500
an incredible feeling. Yeah. I
have told one of the

569
00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:03.360
things that I said in
the, in the keynote that

570
00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:05.220
I really believe, and I
think people laughed a little

571
00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:07.290
bit when I said it,
but I think it's true.

572
00:32:07.290 --> 00:32:10.140
As I said, just because
you're here, I'm addressing the

573
00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:14.130
audience. You are in the
top tier of developers. Not

574
00:32:14.130 --> 00:32:18.060
necessarily in skill, but in
passion because you're here because

575
00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:20.790
for every one development here,
there's a thousand that never

576
00:32:20.790 --> 00:32:23.430
showed. Yeah. That was a
really early talk to you.

577
00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:25.740
Oh, thank you. You're lucky
now is early. My little

578
00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:28.020
keynote. I thought it went
okay. It was good. It

579
00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:30.370
was good. I wasn't fishing
for compliments, but thank you

580
00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:32.310
very much. Okay. No, it
was funny. I really got

581
00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:35.130
to do the animated gift
thing. It's funny that you

582
00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:37.200
say that because we had
Greg young here and he

583
00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:40.910
actually had content. Oh yeah.
I was, I was talking

584
00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:43.090
to him Or the whole
content. I just have animated

585
00:32:43.090 --> 00:32:45.350
gifts, but I talked for
like 75 minutes. Yeah. Yeah.

586
00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:47.020
That's how, that's how it's
supposed to be. I think

587
00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:50.830
you're supposed to talk more
than what your presentation has.

588
00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:54.130
I don't know. I went
way over, whatever. Cool. Well,

589
00:32:54.490 --> 00:32:56.830
give me links to your
user group and your website

590
00:32:56.830 --> 00:32:58.180
and your portfolio and stuff.
And I'll add it to

591
00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:02.050
the show notes. Thanks. Thanks
so much, Natasha Irizarry for

592
00:33:02.050 --> 00:33:03.880
talking to me today. And
we're here at code on

593
00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:07.870
the beach, a new conference
happening in Jacksonville, Florida. This

594
00:33:07.870 --> 00:33:10.240
has been another episode of
Hanselminutes and we'll see you

595
00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:11.110
again next week.
