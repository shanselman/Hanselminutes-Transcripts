this is Scott Hanselman. This

9
00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.890
is another episode of Hansel
minutes. And today I'm talking

10
00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.430
with Yasmeen, save on Honda,
a lawyer at Yash law

11
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.430
firm. And I found you
on Instagram at startup lawyer

12
00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.290
lady. You're very technically savvy
for a lawyer, 54 may

13
00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.320
forgive me saying that I've
got this impression that lawyers

14
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:06.320
are faxing things and doing
things with regular papers. I

15
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.030
hate to bring it to
you. And many of us

16
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.140
still are, but some of
us are trying to, I

17
00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.110
guess you could say, get
with the times. So yeah,

18
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.860
I, I pride myself in
that. Why is it that

19
00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.560
we like the public or
the techies and the public

20
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.460
have a feeling like lawyers
are like stuck in the

21
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.130
past when we hear about
like people still faxing stuff,

22
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.470
but there seems to be
a new generation of lawyer

23
00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.460
that maybe is getting more,
more technical. Yeah. You know,

24
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.650
I wish I could. I
wish I had an answer

25
00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.390
to that question, Scott. There
are, it might be a

26
00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.260
matter of, I dunno, a
couple of different factors are

27
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.200
coming to mind. So the
law itself, you know, the

28
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.870
practice of law and the
law that's on the books.

29
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.420
I mean, that takes a
lot of time for it

30
00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.450
to change and to catch
up. And so technology moves

31
00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.170
so quickly and the law
and legislation itself in order

32
00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.810
for that to be enacted
and, you know, just proposed

33
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.030
in general and goes through
the process that it is

34
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.630
required to go through that
takes years, you know, and

35
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.140
as you and I are
both familiar with technology in

36
00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.770
a general sense, it moves
very quickly, right? So technology

37
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.680
from a year ago may
be outdated at this point,

38
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.380
right? Whereas there are laws
on the books from 30

39
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.920
plus years ago, some are
still applicable and some are

40
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.650
not, and that's just sort
of the nature of it.

41
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.260
And I'd like to think
that, you know, the Lolo

42
00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.840
catch up, but the practice
of law certainly has changed

43
00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.540
a lot in the last,
you know, few last decades,

44
00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.910
certainly in the last two
decades, I'd say, and the

45
00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.330
practice of law itself with
the introduction of technology and

46
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.470
the use of the internet,
and certainly social media in

47
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.940
with marketing in recent years,
that's just transformed the way

48
00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.240
that clients, that attorneys are
communicating. And so, yeah, I,

49
00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.670
I came in at a
pretty good time say One

50
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.440
of the things that I've
noticed as a, as a

51
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.620
consumer of legal services is
in the last maybe decade

52
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.720
or so, the thing that's
most significant to me is

53
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.040
the idea of digital signatures
using DocuSign and things like

54
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.760
that. Did that just happen
because the, the, the industry

55
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.380
demanded it or was there
some like precedent or some

56
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.900
thing was like, yeah, this
person clicked on this PDF.

57
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.500
Therefore it's their signature. Like
when did that decision happen?

58
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.220
Or someone said that was
a thing. Yeah, that's a

59
00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.420
great question. I'm not sure
when exactly it happened. I

60
00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.900
would say my guess is
that it happened in the

61
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.230
age of the internet, but
it's interesting that you bring

62
00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.510
that up. Is that, is
it just because somebody clicked

63
00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.380
on this PDF and that
means it's a signature. I

64
00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.110
remember back in law school,
when I studied estate planning

65
00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.100
and development of wills and,
you know, trusts and things

66
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:58.740
like that for individuals, there,
there is a, some sort

67
00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.470
of statute in the state
of Texas, where if you

68
00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.370
just make, if that individual
just creates some sort of

69
00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.610
marketing, it doesn't necessarily have
to be their actual signature

70
00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.980
or even their name. It
could be some sort of

71
00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.990
marking and that constitutes as
a signature or, you know,

72
00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.870
authorization, if they're granting authorization
or whatever, it might be

73
00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.180
agreement to a contract if
it is a written agreement.

74
00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.900
And so I think it's,
I think the market demanded

75
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.100
it because of, you know,
faxing becoming a thing of

76
00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.640
the past somewhat, I don't
own a fax machine, but

77
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.720
I know most law offices
do have fax machines and

78
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.070
courts still use fax machines.
And when I hear, when

79
00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.280
I deal with the court
and they don't use email,

80
00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.770
I'm like, what? Like what,
how, how is this possible?

81
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.910
But it is right. And
if I think it's, it's

82
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.330
also a matter of investing,
you know, the resources in

83
00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.930
bringing things up to date,
which, Hey, in, in their

84
00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.660
minds, it might be a
matter of if it's not

85
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.780
broken, we're not going to
fix it. You know, it

86
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.490
works just fine. Everybody knows
how we operate. We'll keep

87
00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.580
doing it until we can't
anymore. And I guess nobody's

88
00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.040
objected at this point. So
yeah, I don't, I don't

89
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.670
know when that came about,
but that's a great question.

90
00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:19.590
Yeah. I find it comforting
that you don't have a

91
00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.370
fax machine somehow. I just
imagine that all are tracking,

92
00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:27.780
You know, there have been
multiple times where I'm like,

93
00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.880
do I really need to
get a fax machine, but

94
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.270
I haven't yet. So I've
made it this long without

95
00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.230
investing in a ring forest
rather to prejudice the fax

96
00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:39.330
machine, but yeah. Yeah. And
then it's so it's so

97
00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.340
ridiculous that sometimes don't make
us like, do like an

98
00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.850
FX and it's like all
this technology, just so I

99
00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:46.620
can end up giving you
a fake piece of paper,

100
00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.430
Ways we could communicate. And
this is your, this is

101
00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.180
your method of choice. So,
So one of your specialties

102
00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.310
at Yash from at Yash,
from.com is helping people out

103
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.170
with their startups, with their
ideas, you know, all the

104
00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:02.420
legal support when someone has
an idea and they want

105
00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:05.450
to make that thing happen.
And I realized that if

106
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:07.760
someone quizzed me and said,
what's the difference between a

107
00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.630
trademark, a copyright and a
patent, I would probably have

108
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.620
a very long awkward pause
And I'd be like, Ooh,

109
00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.770
well, let me patent, that's
like The most important thing.

110
00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:20.020
Maybe you could help me
understand and share those things.

111
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:25.090
Yeah, absolutely. So those are
the three main types of

112
00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:28.450
intellectual property. So as far
as let's, let's, we can

113
00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:31.360
take a step back the
difference between intellectual property and

114
00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.500
real property. So real property,
those are tangible things like,

115
00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:38.110
you know, maybe it's a
building, maybe it's personal property.

116
00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:41.500
Maybe it's a piece of
land, you know, things that

117
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.440
you can touch and see
and feel right now, intellectual

118
00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:49.240
property. That is more so
intangible. So we've got those,

119
00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.000
like you mentioned, Scott, we've
got patents, we've got trademarks,

120
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.480
we've got copyrights. So patents
are rights that are granted

121
00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:02.890
to the original inventor of
the invention by the U

122
00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:06.160
S government. And it gives
that owner the right to

123
00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:11.770
exclude others from using or
profiting from that invention. And

124
00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:16.630
it's a limited period of
time, right? So there isn't

125
00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:21.760
a perpetual grant in the
right to create whatever and

126
00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:24.520
Tetra or reproduce it or,
or use it or profit

127
00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:27.430
from it. I think in
the U S it's for

128
00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:30.010
a period of 20 years.
Okay. And so after the

129
00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:32.050
20 years, it's sort of
a free for all, but

130
00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:34.600
for that period of 20
years, that individual, that inventor

131
00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:37.720
has the right to reproduce
it profit off of it,

132
00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:41.050
import it from out of
the country, you know, really

133
00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:44.920
just have control over the
use of the reproduction of

134
00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:50.860
that invention. It's gotta be
something that is novel. It

135
00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:54.880
should be non-obvious and non-functional.
And so I'm not a

136
00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.330
patent attorney. These are each,
each of these areas that

137
00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:00.010
I'm going to go into
copyright and trademarks and a

138
00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:02.650
little bit, each of these
areas are very complex, as

139
00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:06.460
you can imagine. Right? So
my focus is on trademark

140
00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:10.900
law and that's really where
I that's really where I

141
00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:14.890
work with my clients and
developing solid trademark assets and

142
00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:18.220
then taking the steps necessary
to protect them. And so

143
00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:22.120
what a trademark is, is
a source identifier. And so

144
00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:25.330
as a business, as a
startup, as a brand, you

145
00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:29.290
have source identifiers that you're
using in commerce to identify

146
00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:31.750
the source of the goods
and services that you're selling.

147
00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:34.360
And so I'm a good
example. I like to use

148
00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:37.690
this Nike because everyone recognizes
Nike. We're all familiar with

149
00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:41.440
the brand. Nike, Nike is
the brand name that is

150
00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:44.470
their trademark. They're using the
word Mark Nike to identify

151
00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:47.710
the source of the goods
that they sell. Another trademark

152
00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:51.880
they have is their logo.
And that is that swoosh

153
00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:54.730
symbol, right? The checkmark, you
see the swoosh symbol on

154
00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:56.790
a pair of track pants,
or you see it on,

155
00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:59.280
you know, a shirt or
a basketball or whatever it

156
00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:02.160
may be. You automatically recognize
that that the source of

157
00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.610
that product is the company
Nike, right? And you associate

158
00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:09.090
certain things with that. So
you associate a certain level

159
00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:13.560
of quality, right. With a
brand. And with that product,

160
00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:16.800
when you see the trademark
on, you know, the product

161
00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:20.490
is bearing that trademark and
connecting itself with the, with

162
00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:24.150
the source, which ultimately here
is Nike. And then, you

163
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:27.240
know, they've got their, their
slogan, which is another trademark.

164
00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:29.640
I would just, just do
it, right. We're all familiar

165
00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:32.250
with that. You hear just
do it, you see, just

166
00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:34.650
do it. You automatically associate
whatever it is that you're

167
00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:38.910
seeing that on with the
company, Nike, and again, your,

168
00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.640
that brings to mind, you
know, a certain level of

169
00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:47.490
quality maybe of philanthropy and
whatever that might be. And

170
00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:51.510
so that's really where I
focus my energies and my

171
00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:54.390
time in working with my
clients. And we'll talk more

172
00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:56.940
in depth on that in
a little bit. I'm sure,

173
00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:59.520
but the third kind of
piece of intellectual property is

174
00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:03.270
copyrights. And so with copyrights,
that is the rights and

175
00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:05.970
the ownership in an original
work of art or authorship.

176
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.720
And so the kinds of
copyrights that you might have

177
00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:13.980
within your business might be
photography, videography written words. So

178
00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:17.790
if you've got a blog,
if you've got like yourself,

179
00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:21.600
you have your podcast. So
you have ownership in the

180
00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:26.040
audio files, the recordings, these
are original works of art

181
00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:29.430
or authorship. And so as
a copyright owner, you have

182
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:31.230
the right to reproduce it.
You have the right to

183
00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:34.170
create derivative works based on
it. You have the right

184
00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:38.370
to, you know, authorize others
to use it or benefit

185
00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:40.980
from it or reproduce it.
And so that means you

186
00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:44.760
could license it to others.
You could develop derivative works

187
00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:48.720
in terms of you have
a podcast recording, you could

188
00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:51.810
create written works based on
that, like a transcription you

189
00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:55.260
could develop, maybe graphics based
on, you know, including the

190
00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.350
quotes that you're pulling from
these recordings. And so it's

191
00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:00.750
a wide range of rights
that you have as the

192
00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:03.900
owner in the law they
referred to as the bundle

193
00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:06.270
of sticks. And so you
can always separate the bundle

194
00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:08.130
of sticks. I might decide
like, I'm going to grant

195
00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:11.340
you the right to license
this to others, but I'm

196
00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:15.420
still gonna maintain ownership over
the copyright. And so, yeah,

197
00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:19.800
so you can, you could
probably imagine how all of

198
00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:24.210
these assets are valuable within
a business and within a

199
00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:25.920
startup and how you want
to make sure that you're

200
00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:31.560
taking the steps necessary to
protect your assets from infringers.

201
00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:34.800
Because as I'm sure, you
know, people start popping out

202
00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:39.300
the woodwork when you create
something, you know, fabulous. They

203
00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:42.720
want to reproduce it. They
want to, you know, replicate

204
00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:46.350
it and they try, but
you have to make sure

205
00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:49.380
that you're enforcing your rights
and that way your rights

206
00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:53.710
don't become diluted. Okay. So
then in order to have

207
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:56.770
copyright protection, something must be
original. So you and I

208
00:11:56.770 --> 00:12:00.250
are on this podcast, having
a conversation, which is presumably

209
00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:04.810
original. So it's, it's a,
a tangible medium where that

210
00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:07.390
tangible medium is this MP3
that people are listening to

211
00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:09.400
right now, or it's in,
it's in a fixed form.

212
00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:12.850
I can make it a
transcript or a book or

213
00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:18.580
whatever, but you're talking the
most. I'm hosting the podcast.

214
00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:22.000
You own your words, but
I own the copyright, even

215
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.790
though you're saying cool stuff,
at what point could you

216
00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:26.950
and I have a big
fight and you could say,

217
00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:30.190
Hey, Scott, stop talking and
stop making. T-shirts about something

218
00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:32.740
that Yasmeen said on the
podcast. That was really amazing.

219
00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:34.920
There's a lot of gray
area in the world of

220
00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:38.160
intellectual property, right? So let's
say you created a tee

221
00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:42.090
shirt and you've got this
t-shirt design and you develop

222
00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:45.870
the design, but the words
are mine. And so then

223
00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:49.260
the design, you have copyright
ownership in that. But the

224
00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:53.280
words, if they are original
words that I, you know,

225
00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:56.910
strung together, I guess you
could say You dropped the

226
00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:59.790
knowledge on this show, right?
Not just randomly when we

227
00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:03.120
were having coffee, but like
while we were recording. Yeah.

228
00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:07.650
So the recording, since you
developed the recording, you would

229
00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:12.000
have presumably copyright ownership in
the recording. Now I have

230
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.890
some clients that are, that
have podcasts and we develop

231
00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:20.400
contracts that make it very
clear who owns what, and

232
00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:25.500
that as the podcast, producer
and host, that you are

233
00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:29.190
granted a license from me
as the guest, you know,

234
00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:33.660
to, to reproduce, you know,
these, you know, the recordings

235
00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:37.260
and to reproduce the content
that we've discussed. And that

236
00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:41.490
is, you know, here in
this tangible medium. And so,

237
00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:43.860
yeah, it's the best case
scenarios. You want to make

238
00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:47.130
sure that all parties agree
so that you are clear

239
00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:49.080
on what your rights are
and you don't find yourself

240
00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:51.390
in some hot water later
on where you might say,

241
00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:54.750
okay, well, you know, Yasmeen
said some really cool things

242
00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:57.090
I want to share with
others because I think it'll

243
00:13:57.090 --> 00:13:59.040
be useful to them. You
want to make sure that

244
00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:02.370
Yasmeen has granted you the
right to do so. And

245
00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:05.010
then that way I don't
come back later on and

246
00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:07.140
say, well, wait a second.
You know, you're making a

247
00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:09.090
lot of money off of
what I shared with you,

248
00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:11.730
and I want some of
that, right? You don't want

249
00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:15.420
to deal with that unnecessarily.
And so that way, and

250
00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:18.210
that's not really, I'm just
sort of as a general

251
00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:20.880
principle that I share with
my clients and with my

252
00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:23.580
audience is that you really
want to be proactive when

253
00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:26.160
it comes to protecting your
intellectual property and protecting your

254
00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.620
business. You don't want to
deal with doing that damage

255
00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:31.680
control later on, or having
to deal with a lawsuit

256
00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:34.170
or hiring, you know, a
lawyer to defend you in

257
00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:37.800
that sort of case. You
really, it suits you best

258
00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:39.870
as a business owner so
that you're able to preserve

259
00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:45.480
your energies and focus that
on developing your business and

260
00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:48.390
really operating within your zone
of genius. Instead of having

261
00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:50.790
to invest that in, okay,
let me clean up this

262
00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:53.380
mess could have been avoided.
Well, how do we find

263
00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:55.690
that balance though? I feel
like, I mean, I, and

264
00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:57.640
I'm kind of putting it
out. I'm putting it all

265
00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:01.030
out there. I've done almost
700 episodes over 13 years.

266
00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:03.730
I haven't had an issue
yet, but now you're making

267
00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:05.890
me think maybe I should
hire a lawyer, have someone

268
00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:08.380
fill out like a little
DocuSign before they do the

269
00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:11.890
show, but then I might
turn them off. Right? I

270
00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:15.130
mean, we as regular people
and I'm not trying to

271
00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:17.470
other you as a lawyer,
but you know, we, the,

272
00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:21.130
we, the regular, non-lawyers see
a contract and we're like,

273
00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.350
Ooh, I don't want to
do your podcast. Cause you're

274
00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:25.240
going to make me sign
something. It's like, when your

275
00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:28.510
friend says, Hey, let's have
coffee, but sign this NDA

276
00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:31.600
first. And it's like, well,
you know, either we're friends

277
00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.640
or we send an NDA,
but not both. We need

278
00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:37.300
a contract for doing podcasts.
Are you required to have

279
00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:40.750
one by the law? No.
Would it benefit you and

280
00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:44.440
benefit the other party to
clearly outline what the relationship

281
00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:51.340
is? Yes, absolutely. That can
help mitigate, you know, disagreements

282
00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:55.660
or miscommunications that even heart
failure on exactly or even

283
00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:59.770
hard feelings, you know, and
making sure that it's very

284
00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:02.620
clear, what's taking place here.
And we see this a

285
00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:07.120
lot in the legal business
world is that people kind

286
00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:09.580
of, you know, we just
operate based on a handshake

287
00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:12.100
or I'll take your word
for it. But then later

288
00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:15.250
on things aren't as clear
as they were when we

289
00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:17.920
actually set them. Right. Like,
wait a second. I thought

290
00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:21.010
we agreed to this, but
no, I thought we agreed

291
00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:24.220
to that. Okay. Well, how
are we going to know

292
00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:27.310
what, what was agreed to?
And then all of a

293
00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:30.580
sudden, it's this whole dispute
and that may or may

294
00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:33.910
not lead to, you know,
worst case litigation and having

295
00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:35.230
to deal with it for
years and years in the

296
00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:38.830
courts. And it's very expensive,
you know, the opposite end

297
00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:41.590
of the spectrum, which is
also like not ideal, but,

298
00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:44.230
you know, you ruin the
relationship and you lose that

299
00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:48.820
relationship. And so instead, you
know, this isn't legal advice

300
00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:51.940
by any means, but as
a general rule of thumb,

301
00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:56.440
you know, having a contract
in any type of business

302
00:16:56.440 --> 00:17:01.900
relationship certainly will benefit you
as the business owner, as

303
00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:06.160
the podcast host, as, you
know, the program director or

304
00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:09.040
a course developer or an
instructor or whatever it is,

305
00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:12.700
if you're entering into a
business relationship, you know, my

306
00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:14.860
general recommendation is you want
to, you want to make

307
00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:17.860
sure that it's in writing
what the, the terms of

308
00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:21.970
the relationship are, you know,
how will decisions be made

309
00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:25.420
if it is a partnership,
how is compensation going to

310
00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:28.780
be, you know, made if
money is changing hands and

311
00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:32.050
if services are being exchanged,
and then that way you

312
00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:34.630
can, you know, move forward
in confidence and not have

313
00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:38.740
to worry about any type
of miscommunication or disagreement or

314
00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:41.950
dispute cropping up. Okay. And
then of course it's flexible.

315
00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:43.900
Like there isn't like, and
we're using this podcast as

316
00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:47.170
an example here with copyright,
but certainly I wouldn't have

317
00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:50.220
to write it, have it
written rather in my favor,

318
00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:52.770
it could actually be something
where the guest would say,

319
00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:54.870
Hey, Scott wants to make
sure that, you know, as

320
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:56.970
my guests, that you own
your words. And if you

321
00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:59.490
want to make t-shirts of
your words, that I can't

322
00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:01.740
do that, you know, like
I could actually flip it

323
00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:03.390
around and make it so
they'd be happy that they

324
00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:05.960
were sending it. So that's
actually the, and that's a

325
00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.820
great point that you bring
up Scott is that is

326
00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:11.780
actually the way I prefer
to draft my contracts with

327
00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:14.000
my clients. And I don't
do contract drafting so much

328
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.640
anymore, but it used to
be a significant part of

329
00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:21.110
my practice is that the
contract is there and you

330
00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:23.210
should frame it this way
when you're approaching. So for

331
00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:27.080
example, within the context of
this podcast, I'm presenting it

332
00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:29.840
to you because it's in
both of our best interests,

333
00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:34.040
right? So it clearly States
what, you know, my rights

334
00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:37.070
are, what your rights are
or what, you know, as

335
00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:39.920
we're entering into this business
relationship, your position in my

336
00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:45.170
position and a good contract
should not harm one and

337
00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:48.440
benefit the other because we're
obviously entering into this contract

338
00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:52.010
to move forward in a
business relationship or some sort

339
00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:56.450
of relationship. And so I'm
not creating this contract, you

340
00:18:56.450 --> 00:19:00.170
know, to disadvantage you instead,
it should be to clearly

341
00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:04.610
state the terms of our
relationship and make it clear

342
00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:08.270
what we're moving forward based
on, you know? And so

343
00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:11.060
you could, and you should
say in a contract like

344
00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:13.460
that, just as a general
of them, is that, you

345
00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:17.900
know, I, you, as the
podcast tests are granting a

346
00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:22.700
license to the host to
use, you know, your, your

347
00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:25.880
voice or your likeness or
whatever, it might be in

348
00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:30.080
connection with the promotional materials,
you know, in connection with

349
00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:33.620
that podcast. And then also
you as the guest maintain

350
00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:37.850
ownership over your words or
contribution, or however you end

351
00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:40.970
up stating it. And yeah,
just, just sort of as

352
00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:44.540
a note, Interesting, a big
thank you to our sponsors

that's T E L E

368
00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:43.370
R I k.com/hanselman. So you
made that you made this

369
00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:46.640
statement a couple of times
granting a license to, so

370
00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:50.950
you own your words cause
you said, but you are

371
00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:54.670
allowing me to rebroadcast them.
I've heard that before when

372
00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:57.550
I put things on Facebook
or when I put things

373
00:20:57.550 --> 00:21:00.970
in what I call walled
gardens, like owning a blog

374
00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.880
is my blog. I own
the copyright. I host it.

375
00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:06.670
It's my text and I
own the server. So I

376
00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:10.480
own, I own everything basically,
but Facebook, I type some

377
00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:12.790
words or even not the
type, like a chapter of

378
00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:15.190
a book that I haven't
written yet. I didn't just

379
00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:17.320
give them the entire chapter
of the book. I granted

380
00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:20.530
them a license to display
it again. Is that correct?

381
00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:24.960
Yes. So I have not
read Facebook's terms of use,

382
00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:30.630
but the general idea. Yeah,
yeah. But content generally, if

383
00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:34.170
I am, let's say, and
this is my presumption with

384
00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:36.990
Facebook because I don't think
Facebook could operate unless they

385
00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:40.020
did include the way it
does, unless they did include

386
00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:43.620
this type of license. I'm
thinking that when we upload

387
00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:48.450
photos to Facebook or to
Twitter or Instagram, or, you

388
00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:52.200
know, any other type of
online platform where it is

389
00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:56.340
reproduced, we likely likely in
the terms of use, they

390
00:21:56.340 --> 00:22:00.990
stay you as the user
maintain copyright ownership over your

391
00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:07.080
content because you must expressly
transfer a copyright to the

392
00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:09.330
other party, right. In order
for them to become the

393
00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:11.520
owner of it. So you,
as the original creator of

394
00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:14.460
that work, you own the
copyright and you maintain the

395
00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:18.270
copyright, however you're granting Facebook
or whatever platform it is

396
00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:25.530
a license to reproduce it.
And otherwise you could not

397
00:22:25.530 --> 00:22:28.380
use Facebook the way that
we're using Facebook. Right. So

398
00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:31.230
I share photos to Facebook,
I maintain ownership, but in

399
00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:33.660
order for Facebook to be
able to produce that on

400
00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:38.640
other individuals feeds and, you
know, just online generally or

401
00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:41.760
in searches or however it
is that they work, they

402
00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:44.250
would need a license to
be able to do that.

403
00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:48.120
And so I'm thinking that's
probably what takes place in

404
00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:52.740
their very long terms of
used. Sure. And I realized

405
00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:55.830
that it's unreasonable to expect
you or anyone there, unless

406
00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:58.140
they are a Facebook specific
lawyer, but I'm kind of

407
00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:02.220
using Facebook as a generic
term for social media, walled

408
00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:04.950
gardens in general. I think
it's subtle. Like I don't

409
00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:09.150
think my nontechnical parents understand
that there is an implicit

410
00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:11.910
terms of service for like,
you know, everyone just clicks

411
00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:13.950
okay. On the terms of
service. And we don't realize

412
00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:16.950
that we have signed a
copyright over our trademark or

413
00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:21.690
by, by simply by simply
passively using something, which is

414
00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:23.520
a little bit scary, which
also brings me to the

415
00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:28.050
question. Like, if, if, if
I need a lawyer to

416
00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:30.330
understand something, maybe I shouldn't
be using the thing at

417
00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:35.100
all, trying to find that
balance between being paralyzed with

418
00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:39.780
confusion about these things and
versus being able to move

419
00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:43.170
through the digital world with
confidence. And then also whether

420
00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:44.670
or not I want to
just go to legal zoom

421
00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:47.360
or one of websites and
go through a wizard, or

422
00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:50.330
if I need to go
and pay, you know, hundreds

423
00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:52.130
of thousands of dollars to
talk to a lawyer, I

424
00:23:52.130 --> 00:23:55.850
realized these are all false
equivalencies, but this can cause

425
00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:58.340
someone to kind of have
analysis paralysis and then choose

426
00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:01.580
to basically do nothing. Yeah.
I guess my question is

427
00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:06.290
people are probably doing nothing
and in doing that, maybe

428
00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:10.030
not protecting themselves. Yeah. I
think there are so many

429
00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:14.020
different aspects of this Scott
and you hit the nail

430
00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:16.720
on the head and the,
there is analysis paralysis when

431
00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:20.710
it comes to decision making
in businesses, when it comes

432
00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:24.520
to their, you know, legal
protections and the legal foundation,

433
00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:29.740
I think it is somewhat
of an intimidating process to

434
00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:32.680
begin. You know, I, okay.
I know I need some

435
00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:34.660
legal advice. I know I'm
not totally clear. I did

436
00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:37.300
a couple of Google searches
and I don't really want

437
00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:41.020
to like Frankenstein a whole
contract for my business together

438
00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:43.660
based on what I can
cut and paste, but you

439
00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:46.000
know, helmet, what kind of
lawyer do I even need?

440
00:24:46.150 --> 00:24:49.240
How much is it going
to cost? You know, is

441
00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:51.130
it going to cost me
an arm and a leg?

442
00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:55.900
I don't have 10,000 plus
dollars to invest in a

443
00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:59.740
lawyer right now, our legal
services right now. So maybe

444
00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:03.460
I'll just do nothing. And
it's, it's a really hard

445
00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:08.110
position to be in because
there isn't with a lot

446
00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:11.410
of these things, there aren't
laws in place requiring you,

447
00:25:11.410 --> 00:25:14.770
for example, as a business
owner to, you know, take

448
00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:16.960
these steps, you have to
have a contract in place

449
00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:19.660
or you have to have
your trademark protected, or you

450
00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:23.410
have to file for a
patent. There isn't, there isn't

451
00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:26.530
anything requiring these individuals to
do that. So they can

452
00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:29.770
continue to operate their business
outside of that. And then

453
00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:32.530
once it catches up to
them that at that point,

454
00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:35.110
they have to hire a
lawyer to defend them, to

455
00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:38.680
develop their legal foundation, to
form an entity, to draft

456
00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:42.730
a contract, whatever it might
be. Right. And so your

457
00:25:42.730 --> 00:25:47.350
question was the first part
of that question was, you

458
00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:49.780
know, how do I, is
it, is it dangerous for

459
00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:52.750
me to just be using
these different tools online or,

460
00:25:53.530 --> 00:25:56.230
you know, even Facebook, you
know, something as basic as

461
00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:59.230
face and as commonplace as
Facebook, you know, if I

462
00:25:59.230 --> 00:26:02.980
don't understand the legal implications
of clicking agree under their

463
00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:05.890
terms of use, when I
create an account, should I

464
00:26:05.890 --> 00:26:08.680
even be using it? So
again, this is not legal

465
00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:14.290
advice, just general, Nothing in
this podcast. This is like

466
00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:19.420
purely for informational purposes, but
just generally speaking, there is

467
00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:24.220
a, there's a doctrine in
contract law and it's all

468
00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:29.110
about unconscionability okay. So the
average person does not, you

469
00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:32.440
know, read through every single
word and a terms of

470
00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:33.910
use. I mean, I'm an
attorney and I do not

471
00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:37.450
read there when my Apple
computer has an update, which

472
00:26:37.450 --> 00:26:39.940
is like, it feels like
every other day it has

473
00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:44.400
enough uptake. I don't read
through that. I click agree

474
00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:46.890
and I move on and
everything is fine. And, you

475
00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:51.300
know, I just hope for
the best. Now, if there

476
00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:55.020
were to be something, for
example, I'm, you know, transferring

477
00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:59.820
ownership of my, you know,
homestead in those terms or,

478
00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:02.070
you know, I agreed to
let them have my first

479
00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:07.020
born child in the event
that I, you know, whatever,

480
00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:11.610
whatever the terms might say
unconscionability means that that provision,

481
00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:15.450
if it is not right
or just, or reasonable, or

482
00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:20.460
if it's unreasonably excessive, it
will be disregarded. So a

483
00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:23.390
court would not force. Yeah,
of course I work in

484
00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:26.810
something in a while. It
updates. It's like, okay, if

485
00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:29.810
you click, okay, you've given
Apple, your car that's in

486
00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:34.580
contract. Exactly. Yes, exactly. That's
unreasonable. You know, the average

487
00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:38.660
person would not expect that
to be within a software

488
00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:42.590
update. Right. And so, and
I mean, I can't guarantee

489
00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:45.290
that would be the case
in every single contract. Maybe,

490
00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:48.920
you know, reasonable, reasonable minds
may differ. Right. And that's

491
00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:51.440
why we have the courts
work, things like that out.

492
00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:56.330
But yeah, generally speaking, if
I'm, you know, using Facebook

493
00:27:56.330 --> 00:28:00.620
or using Google or using
some sort of software best

494
00:28:00.650 --> 00:28:03.530
practice, absolute best practice is
to be clear on what

495
00:28:03.530 --> 00:28:06.440
it is you're agreeing to.
And certainly if you're entering

496
00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:12.560
into a longterm commitment or
a longterm business relationship, you

497
00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:15.740
want to be clear on
what those terms are that

498
00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:19.190
you're agreeing to. And having
a lawyer review that contract

499
00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:23.090
is a great decision to
make, just because a lawyer

500
00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:25.520
can decipher, you know, what
is in all this fine

501
00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:28.190
print of what are, what
will be required of me

502
00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:31.130
as a party in this
agreement. But if this is

503
00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:33.920
just a general terms of
use that, you know, it's

504
00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:37.670
a software license, or, you
know, I'm creating an account

505
00:28:37.670 --> 00:28:43.340
on a social media platform.
Yeah. I wouldn't be paralyzed

506
00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:47.060
from fear of, you know,
agreeing to their terms of

507
00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:50.840
use. Yeah. It's just something
to keep in mind. Another

508
00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:53.120
thing that we were, we
talked about beforehand that I

509
00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:54.980
wanted to cover in this
show was the idea. If

510
00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:57.260
I'm working on a project
and I'm like a small

511
00:28:57.260 --> 00:29:00.500
business, and then I'm hiring
other small businesses to make

512
00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:04.430
me like a logo or
write me, you know, punch

513
00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:07.910
up some text or something
like that, do I pay

514
00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:09.770
you? And you make me
a logo and then you

515
00:29:09.770 --> 00:29:13.340
email me the logo. Did
you own the logo? Do

516
00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:15.470
I own the logo? But
I, if it's unsafe, I

517
00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:17.390
mean, the assumption is I
just paid you, I own

518
00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:19.250
the logo, but you could
come back 10 years from

519
00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:21.680
now and say, yeah, I
made that logo. Yeah. He

520
00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:23.840
paid me, but I still
own it. Or if I

521
00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:26.360
hire someone to take photos,
they own them. Right. They

522
00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:29.810
could still sell them again.
Yes, exactly. And that is

523
00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:34.100
something that so many business
owners just don't understand. And

524
00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:37.370
aren't familiar with this concept
of work, for hire in

525
00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:40.640
terms of copyright ownership. And
so if I hired a

526
00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:43.810
designer to develop a logo
for me, they are the

527
00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:47.590
original author of that design,
that graphic design. And so

528
00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:49.990
even though I paid them
to provide me with the

529
00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:52.030
logo, I might have provided
them with all the inspiration

530
00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:56.830
necessary to develop the design.
They still have created it

531
00:29:56.830 --> 00:30:00.070
themselves. And so they maintain
copyright ownership of it. And

532
00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:02.980
that means they have that
bundle of sticks that we

533
00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:05.620
were talking about of rights.
And so they could license

534
00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:07.990
it to others. They could
tweak it and create derivative

535
00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:11.140
works based on it. And
by providing it to me

536
00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:14.650
and by my hiring of
them, I have sort of

537
00:30:14.650 --> 00:30:18.100
an implied license to the
use of it, but they're

538
00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:20.050
still able to turn around.
And that's what I see

539
00:30:20.050 --> 00:30:22.450
a lot of people experiencing.
And they're like, what the

540
00:30:22.450 --> 00:30:24.940
hell? Like, I didn't say
you could sell that to

541
00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:28.330
somebody else, but the designer
will turn around and sell

542
00:30:28.330 --> 00:30:30.670
that design to another business
for them to use as

543
00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:33.400
their logo. And so it's
really important to make sure

544
00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:36.220
that when you are hiring
someone to develop some work

545
00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:38.620
of art or authorship, so
maybe I hire a copywriter

546
00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:41.410
to develop written blogs for
my website. Maybe I hire

547
00:30:41.410 --> 00:30:45.370
a photographer to develop photos
or videographer to shoot video

548
00:30:45.370 --> 00:30:49.090
footage or a graphic designer
to develop some graphic designs.

549
00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:51.400
You want to make sure
that there's a copyright transfer

550
00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:57.010
agreement that is signed that
clearly and expressly transfers ownership

551
00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:59.140
of it. And that way
you are the one that

552
00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:01.480
owns it and are able
to license it to others,

553
00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:04.050
are able to reproduce it,
are able to use it

554
00:31:04.090 --> 00:31:07.510
any which way you wish.
Instead of being limited by,

555
00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:11.130
you know, the ownership of
another Interesting, the thing that

556
00:31:11.130 --> 00:31:12.840
was most significant about what
you said, there was the

557
00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:17.610
idea of implicit versus explicit.
There's an implicit license and

558
00:31:17.610 --> 00:31:19.980
we can all assume that,
but if it doesn't get

559
00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:24.300
written down, it's not right
Within copyright ownership, a transfer

560
00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:28.260
of the rights must be
explicit. It must be express.

561
00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:31.440
We can't assume that. However,
when I hire you to

562
00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:35.520
take photos, it can be
implied that I intend to

563
00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:39.810
use that, right. Otherwise I
wouldn't have hired you, but

564
00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:43.740
it can't be implied that
the tra the copyright ownership

565
00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:47.070
is being transferred to me
unless we have that in

566
00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:50.400
writing and agreed to by
both parties. Interesting. And this

567
00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:52.410
gets to the, the, the
root of what we were

568
00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:55.820
talking about, where people are
just counting on handshakes. They're

569
00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:59.880
counting on assumptions. They're counting
on implicit rights. Yes. Yeah.

570
00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:05.310
That's the, that's where it
gets to the problematic specifically

571
00:32:05.910 --> 00:32:10.050
when it comes to trademark
law and protection of your

572
00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:13.110
trademark assets. A lot of
people think, well, you know,

573
00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:16.800
I hired someone to develop
my logo or my, my,

574
00:32:17.250 --> 00:32:20.400
my whole brand identity based
on this name, or based

575
00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:25.230
on this inspiration that I
provided them. And they said,

576
00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:28.230
it should be fine. They
haven't seen anything like it.

577
00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:31.380
And they move forward based
on that sort of blind

578
00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:33.780
faith, I guess. And I'm
not really sure why they

579
00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:36.090
would, but I guess it's
a matter of, you don't

580
00:32:36.090 --> 00:32:38.520
know what you don't know.
Right. And when you don't

581
00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:40.790
know what, you know, you
don't even know what questions

582
00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:42.890
to ask. You don't know
where to look. You don't

583
00:32:42.890 --> 00:32:46.040
know who to consult with.
And so I see a

584
00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:48.740
lot of people within the
trademark space doing is they'll

585
00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:51.230
move forward and develop their
whole business and their whole

586
00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:54.560
brand based on a name
based on a product name,

587
00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:56.690
based on a slogan or
a logo or whatever it

588
00:32:56.690 --> 00:32:59.150
might be. And then they
get hit with a cease

589
00:32:59.150 --> 00:33:01.790
and desist, or they get
hit with an infringement lawsuit

590
00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:05.180
because somebody else is already
using a name that is

591
00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:08.150
similar to it. And just
because it's not exactly the

592
00:33:08.150 --> 00:33:11.330
same doesn't mean there isn't
a situation, a possible situation

593
00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:14.330
of infringement there. So that's
something to keep in mind.

594
00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:17.110
I appreciate that. Well, thanks
so much for chatting with

595
00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:22.060
me today. And people can
engage with you right@yshfrom.com and

596
00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:24.430
you can advise them. And
this is literally what you

597
00:33:24.430 --> 00:33:26.560
do. What you've talked about
with me on the show

598
00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:28.780
about getting people started, making
sure that they're protected and

599
00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:31.330
they're successful in their startups
is literally what you do.

600
00:33:31.810 --> 00:33:34.090
Absolutely. And it would be
my pleasure. Thank you for

601
00:33:34.090 --> 00:33:37.450
having me, Scott. Fantastic. I've
been talking with Yasmeen Salem

602
00:33:37.450 --> 00:33:40.840
Hamden, and this has been
another episode of Hanselminutes and

603
00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:58.930
we'll see you again next
week. <inaudible>.
