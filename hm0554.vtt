00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.300
From Hansel minutes.com. It's Hanselman.
That's a weekly discussion with

2
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.730
web developer and technologist Scott
Hanselman. This is Lawrence Ryan announcing

3
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.260
your show number 554. In
this episode, Scott talks with

4
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.520
Sophia Abdullah about new ways
to think about interactive computing.

5
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.840
Hi, this is Scott Hanselman.
This is another episode of

6
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.080
Hansel minutes today. I'm talking
about Sophia Abdullah, who is

7
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.210
the maintainer of interact and
a data scientist. I'm doing

8
00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.360
great, Scott, how are you?
Lovely. Thanks for chatting with

9
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.080
me today. I've been watching
your stuff online and you

10
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.630
have more side hustles and
more cool stuff going on

11
00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.780
than most people have in
their day jobs. As I'm

12
00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.130
a perpetual hustler, You can't
stop and you take it

13
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:08.930
on another new project recently.
Yes, I have so interact.

14
00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.090
It's it's, it's not I
N but it's just the

15
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.620
letter N interact is a,
a, is a popular literate

16
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.330
coding notebook. You've got almost
500 stars on a, on

17
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.900
a good hub here, and
it's not just interact, but

18
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.420
it's a whole kind of
family of sub projects underneath

19
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.530
it. But what is it?
Literate, coding notebook. That's a

20
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.760
great question. So a literate
coding notebook is a document

21
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:40.250
that allows people to have
markdown texts, so textual content,

22
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:46.040
narrative stories, and along with
that code, that's executable and

23
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.640
embedded. So you, if you
have a computational narrative that

24
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.340
you want to share, you
can tell that narrative and

25
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.320
back it up with the
code that follows. So if

26
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.990
we think about a lot
of the really interesting things

27
00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.830
that are going on in
data, journalism and scientific computing

28
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.410
and interact is the perfect
place for all of that.

29
00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.440
It seems like this is
an instance of, of a,

30
00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.670
of a general problem or
a general solution that I'm

31
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.190
seeing a lot more of
a number of years ago,

32
00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.060
I saw an application called
Calca C a L C

33
00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.410
a. Are you familiar with
Calca? So Calca came out

34
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.980
in 2013, and basically you
type some Mark down and

35
00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.870
you type some Mark down
and then suddenly you type

36
00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.020
an equation and then it
solves it, and then you

37
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.120
keep typing some pros. So
it would be as if

38
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.060
you were writing an article
about fixed rate mortgages, and

39
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.340
then suddenly in the middle
of it, there was a

40
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.750
equations that isn't quite mathematical,
but it's very mathy. And

41
00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.550
it's just, it's an, it's
not, it's no longer a

42
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.990
document. It's a living breathing
notebook. Yeah, that's a, that's

43
00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.270
a great analogy. And you're
right. It definitely is kind

44
00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.420
of part of this larger
revolution that's going on in

45
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.670
computing, I think is computers
and technology and programming become

46
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:05.260
more involved in our lives.
And people become more proficient

47
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.810
users of technology. We start
to think of really interesting

48
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.330
ways to integrate them into
the way that we tell

49
00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:16.270
stories. And it happens to
people like journalists and scientists.

50
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.000
My dream in the future
is that anyone who has

51
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.270
an interesting story, whether they're
working in civic tech or

52
00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.600
whether they're an elementary school
teacher can use the power

53
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.480
of literate coding to share
that narrative and back it

54
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.420
up with computation. So starting
kind of 15, 20, 30

55
00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.720
years ago, like we started
with HTML. And then there

56
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.000
was a time in the
middle nineties when we were

57
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.880
doing math ML, but Matthew,
Mel was just a way

58
00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.090
to like render something, but
it didn't really live. It

59
00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.720
was just a picture. You
know, when did things go

60
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.660
from, when one of the
interactivity get, you know, get

61
00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.230
injected into the conversation? Was
it JavaScript that needed to

62
00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.590
make that happen? I think
the inactivity really happened when

63
00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.910
the web came to be
the modern web as it

64
00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:08.820
is, I think. Yeah. Yeah.
The JavaScript friendly web And

65
00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.120
to kind of put, interact
into perspective and explain some

66
00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.740
of the history behind it,
the predecessor or the grandpa

67
00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:22.530
of interact is a technology
called Jupiter notebook. Jupiter notebook

68
00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.460
was developed a couple of
years ago and it's entirely

69
00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.240
written in JavaScript on the
front end, uses jQuery back

70
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.580
when jQuery was very popular
and it relies on this

71
00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.540
messaging protocol called the Jupiter
messaging protocol that defines how

72
00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.920
an interactive front end can
communicate with a backend that

73
00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:48.300
provides the actual ability to
execute the code. So you

74
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.120
provide the front end. That's
like the pretty cells, the

75
00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.500
editing interface, all that fun
stuff. And there's a kernel

76
00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.140
as it's called on your
machine or on a remote

77
00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.500
server. That's responsible for executing
the code that you sent

78
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.920
to it. And Jupiter was
the project that really laid

79
00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.530
the groundwork for this kind
of interactivity and this kind

80
00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:11.460
of messaging between front ends
and back ends and interact

81
00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.550
builds on that with some
more modern technologies. So we're

82
00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:21.720
using react on the front
end for our components, and

83
00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.930
it's entirely built in JavaScript
because we're a little obsessed

84
00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.540
with that. And you might
be wondering, you know, it's

85
00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.310
using react, but it's a
desktop application. Like in grade

86
00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:36.330
seamlessly with my desktop, I
can click to open files.

87
00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:38.670
I can have it on
my dock or on my

88
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:43.950
desktop. And that's because of
really cool technology called electron,

89
00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:47.160
which I think kind of
speaks to the power of

90
00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.360
the web. Electron gives you
the ability to package HTML,

91
00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.680
CSS and Java script into
a desktop based application that

92
00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:01.220
kind of runs a chromium
browser on your desktop. And

93
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:04.640
we use that to make
interact, integrate seamlessly with the

94
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.770
desktop. I like to say
interact as the best of

95
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:09.110
the web and the best
of desktops all in one.

96
00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.760
Hmm. Yeah. We actually had
one of the originators of

97
00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.000
electron on the show and
it Jessica. Yeah, she's awesome

98
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.620
lady. Yeah. About a 10
or 20 episodes. It goes,

99
00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:22.840
people can check that out.
So going back a little

100
00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.060
bit farther in history though,
because we talk about, you

101
00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.090
talk about how Jupiter and
that's Jupiter with a Y

102
00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.150
instead of an, I just
kind of like the grandfather,

103
00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.850
if you keep going farther
and farther back there was

104
00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.940
I Python, which was kind
of like interactive Python, right.

105
00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:40.570
And then the more general
concept of, of a ripple,

106
00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.960
it seems like, like having
a rebel, like an interactive,

107
00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:46.540
you know, redeveloped print loop
at the command line was

108
00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:50.110
one was one early, early
thing, you know, 30 years

109
00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:53.170
ago. But then when I
Python allowed you to, to

110
00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:58.660
be manipulating something, graphical something
simultaneous, like you'd have your

111
00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:00.700
text and then you'd have
your chart and you'd type

112
00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.760
something in the chart would
change. That was when this

113
00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.640
interactive notebook thing kind of
popped, you know, what you

114
00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:10.330
think. Yeah. It's been sort
of a slow evolution you

115
00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:13.570
started off with I Python
I Python was called I

116
00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:17.350
Python because it was that
interactivity. But the kernel that

117
00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:20.320
you can communicate with in
the backend was just Python.

118
00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:23.920
So that limited it to
Python users and the kind

119
00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:28.210
of jump from being called
Python to Jupiter. Wasn't a

120
00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:31.000
change in technology so much
as it was a way

121
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.570
to communicate to users that,
you know, you don't have

122
00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:36.820
to just use this with
Python. If you're working with

123
00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:39.880
Julia, if you're working with
R, if you're working with.net,

124
00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:45.250
you can use this interactive
platform to create interactive notebook

125
00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:49.570
documents, and then interact just
kind of continues that vision

126
00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:52.300
and brings it to the
desktop and adds a couple

127
00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:55.570
of fun stuff to it.
But yeah, I think this

128
00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:59.800
is just something that we've
been progressing to as people

129
00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:04.690
who think about what's the
best way for programmers, scientists,

130
00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:09.670
researchers, to use computers, to
share their stories. And really

131
00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:13.270
it's a way for you
to communicate something to your

132
00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:16.300
computer and then get something
back really quickly and that

133
00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:20.530
back and forth, making it
more seamless and natural and

134
00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:22.660
informative every step of the
way. If you think about

135
00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:26.830
a rebel, it's it does
the job, but it's not

136
00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:30.280
the most informative infrastructure. If
you think of something like

137
00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:33.220
a JavaScript, JavaScript based Trump
tent, that allows you to

138
00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:37.870
have charts, Molossia other dynamic
components, you can get more

139
00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:41.560
information about from each kind
of read evaluation loop, if

140
00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:44.860
you think about it. Yeah,
no, I think that's a

141
00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:47.740
great point. And it feels
like, so if ripples then

142
00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:50.890
were for programmers, but didn't,
weren't expressive enough, weren't weren't

143
00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:54.820
easy enough. And then Jupiter
started thinking about things and

144
00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.660
for data scientists, do you
think that interact is the

145
00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.570
kind of thing that could
become general enough that nontechnical

146
00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:03.890
parent could find themselves using
it? Yeah, that was one

147
00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:06.050
of our big goals with
the project and the reason

148
00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:10.580
that we decided to make
it desktop-based the web is

149
00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:13.820
King for a lot of
places, but I think most

150
00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:18.200
computer users still rely on
desktop applications. They still use

151
00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:22.460
word. They still use Excel.
And they really feel at

152
00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:25.610
home working with application spaced
in the desktop that allow

153
00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:28.880
them to integrate with things
like their menu bar in

154
00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:32.390
Chrome, or they're a finder
or Explorer on windows. So

155
00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:35.510
we want to bring that
technology to the user where

156
00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:38.120
they feel most comfortable, the
desktop. And we also want

157
00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:42.140
to focus a lot on
user experience. So anyone who's

158
00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:46.070
listening, I strongly encourage you
to go download the interact

159
00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:50.240
alpha release and play around
with it and just experience

160
00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.640
how seamless it is and
how natural it feels to

161
00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.550
use something. One of our
big focuses was making this,

162
00:09:55.550 --> 00:10:01.550
something that was accessible to
the sounds terrible, but like

163
00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:04.910
the lowest denominator of technical
users. So we wanted somebody

164
00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:07.940
who was nontechnical to be
able to figure it out

165
00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:11.000
really quickly, and somebody who
was highly technical to be

166
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.390
able to be extremely productive
in it, because it has

167
00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:18.260
such a low barrier to
entry. Interesting. Okay. So when

168
00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.440
I think of, again, we're
trying to be respectful that,

169
00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.690
you know, it's not bad
to be a nontechnical person.

170
00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:27.980
It's just technical person. I
think of like, I, I

171
00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:30.620
always think of nontechnical parent,
and I know that nontechnical

172
00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:35.150
parent or nontechnical business user
can use Excel. And like

173
00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:38.180
Excel has almost kind of
taken over the world, which

174
00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:41.480
is a good thing in
a bad thing, but, but

175
00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:45.140
it's still very, you know,
it's grids and it's charts

176
00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:47.990
within grids and things like
that. Are you thinking that

177
00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.650
that business user could, could
move from the kinds of

178
00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:55.250
things that they're shoehorning into
Excel and maybe consider interact

179
00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:59.030
for that? Yeah, I would
hope so. And I think

180
00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.490
even a better way to
think about it is as

181
00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:06.140
a connection point between say
data scientists and affirm and

182
00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:10.580
business analysts and affirm. So
say you're a data scientist,

183
00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:13.730
you're working on some computation,
you're building a model. You're

184
00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:17.660
thinking through something, you write
up your thoughts and your

185
00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:21.470
narrative in a single notebook
file. You email it over

186
00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:24.020
to a business analyst or
a manager at your firm

187
00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:28.220
who might have minimal knowledge
about what you're doing and

188
00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:29.720
might just want to be
up to date about what

189
00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.760
it is. And they can
open that document as they

190
00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:37.850
would a word document and
engage with it. And I

191
00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:42.800
think the possibilities for a
platform that connects highly technical

192
00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:48.590
data, scientists, researchers, et cetera,
with nontechnical users is so

193
00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:53.150
powerful because it's really bridging
that knowledge gap between people,

194
00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:57.730
that communication gap between people.
And that's where I think

195
00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:01.110
it comes in most handy.
I see. So it wouldn't

196
00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:03.210
be that I would give,
like, my wife is a

197
00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:05.790
business analyst type person. She's
got an MBA and she

198
00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:10.680
understands things. I don't, I
would make a notebook and

199
00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:13.200
I P Y N B
notebook. And then I would,

200
00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:15.570
I would create that structure
and then send her that

201
00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:17.400
file. And she'd receive it
as a document, just like

202
00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:19.800
she gets a word document.
Yeah. And if she had

203
00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:23.370
interact installed on her machine,
which hopefully she would cause

204
00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:26.790
it is cross platform. So
anyone using any operating system

205
00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:29.100
can use it, all she'd
have to do is double

206
00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:31.590
click that email and it
would open up on her

207
00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:35.160
computer and she could read
it, change the code if

208
00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:38.610
she felt super brave and
daring, or just look at

209
00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:42.630
the results that you sent
her. Interesting. Okay. So when

210
00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:45.120
did you get involved with,
with this project? Cause I

211
00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:47.100
see that it's been around
for a little while and

212
00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:49.320
there's lots of committers, but
when I look at the

213
00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:52.020
chart, it sounds like there
was a, there was a

214
00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:54.300
moment when you got pretty
jazzed about it and suddenly

215
00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:59.460
your commit graph got bigger.
Yeah, that's a great question.

216
00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:04.980
So I got involved with
interact in mid May, 2016. I

217
00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:10.500
got involved with the literate
coding ecosystem in general, in

218
00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:14.070
August of 2015, when I
started contributing to the Jupiter

219
00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:17.910
notebook, which is, as I
mentioned previously, the grandpa of

220
00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:22.080
interact. And since I got
involved with interact in 2016,

221
00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:25.830
I've done a little bit
of everything. I do development.

222
00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:29.610
I manage the Twitter account.
I do some writing for

223
00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:33.060
the blog. I write grants
so that we can get

224
00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:38.130
funding for open source project.
I work on community management.

225
00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:41.040
I figure out how to
get into conferences to speak

226
00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:44.940
about the project. I'm kind
of like a Jack of

227
00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:49.920
all trades in that respect.
Well, certainly those people are

228
00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:52.500
needed. Like I see lots
of people who go and

229
00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:55.110
do some open source and
they maybe write the core

230
00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:56.820
bit of code and then
they commit it and then

231
00:13:56.820 --> 00:14:00.420
they wonder why no one
comes to their site. You

232
00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:02.550
know, someone sent me a
project recently to look at

233
00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:04.080
and they wanted me to
tweet about it and share

234
00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:07.290
about it. And, but they
had no read me. They

235
00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:09.510
had no website. They hadn't,
they had no getting started.

236
00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:12.690
It was just colored. And
it sounds silly to say

237
00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:14.700
that, but you know, get
cologne is kind of a

238
00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:18.570
big, that's asking a lot
of me as the person

239
00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:22.140
who just visited your site.
That's one thing I think

240
00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:24.870
a lot of people fail
to realize in my perspective

241
00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:28.260
of open source is that
it's a lot like running

242
00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:31.260
a startup or a business,
except that you don't make

243
00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:35.400
any money and you also
don't get paid, but you

244
00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:38.640
do have to have the
ability to market your project.

245
00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.710
You do have to have
the ability to understand who's

246
00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:43.950
going to take the biggest
advantage of my project and

247
00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:46.260
be able to leverage it
in interesting ways. And how

248
00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.930
can I get ahold of
those people and get them

249
00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:52.580
into using it in their
business, sponsoring it or any

250
00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:56.780
kind of engagement. How do
I engage with the community?

251
00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:59.060
How do I publicize my
project? How do I get

252
00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:03.710
funding? All that good stuff.
It's basically like being a

253
00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:05.720
little entrepreneur. And that's what
I love about it is

254
00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:09.170
I do have this entrepreneurial
side to me and being

255
00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:11.900
an open source allows me
to activate that and energize

256
00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:15.370
it every day. Not ask
a lot though, of people

257
00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:17.710
like, for example, this is
a project that's currently kind

258
00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:20.680
of buy in for data
scientists, but now you're describing,

259
00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:23.050
you know, managing a Twitter
account and making sure the

260
00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:24.820
read me is clean and
making sure the docs are

261
00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:28.630
good and has an attractive
website. Yeah. That's a skills

262
00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:30.880
that maybe they don't have.
It is a lot. And

263
00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:33.250
I think with open source,
you can do as much

264
00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:37.600
as you feel comfortable doing.
I'm the kind of person

265
00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.970
who loves to be involved
with all kinds of different

266
00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:42.580
things. I don't want to
be just the programmer, just

267
00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:44.920
the developer. I want to
be the marketer and the

268
00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:48.550
social media manager and the
writer and the dev evangelist.

269
00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:52.120
And I have the space
to go crazy with all

270
00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:54.580
that and open source. Nobody's
going to stop me and

271
00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:58.420
say, no, Safia, you can
only to submit PRS and

272
00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:02.410
review PRS and that's all
you're going to do. And

273
00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:05.140
likewise, there are other people
on the project who do

274
00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:07.600
chest stick to development because
that's what they're most comfortable

275
00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:11.470
with and that's their talent.
And that's totally okay. So

276
00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:13.630
the open source, you can
go as far as you're

277
00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:16.930
comfortable with and just make
it your space to be

278
00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:20.470
a great developer, a great
writer, a great manager, a

279
00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:25.150
great marketer. It's kind of
your playground. And that's, what's

280
00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:28.120
so fantastic about it. I
think that I don't like

281
00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:31.570
to use the word unicorn,
but sometimes you're kind of

282
00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:33.580
describing a unicorn in the
sense of, I don't know

283
00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:35.560
how many data scientists that
could also do all the

284
00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:38.470
things that you just described.
I might be a bit

285
00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:41.950
of a unicorn, But your
background is mostly in data

286
00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:43.780
science. Like that's your, that's
your space that you're most

287
00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:47.320
interested in, right? Yeah. I
got really interested in data

288
00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:50.290
science when I was 13
years old, I was a

289
00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:56.230
total documentary geek and I
came upon this documentary about

290
00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:59.530
the Google search engine. So
describe the early days of

291
00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:01.870
Google and how they built
it. And I got really

292
00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:06.940
interested in search engines and
started researching align to information

293
00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:11.140
retrieval, which is the general
field of building search engines

294
00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:15.070
and got like fell down
the rabbit hole of learning

295
00:17:15.070 --> 00:17:19.090
about machine learning and AI
and natural language processing and

296
00:17:19.090 --> 00:17:20.950
all that fun stuff. And
ever since then, I've just

297
00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:24.820
been completely obsessed with the
power of the field and

298
00:17:24.850 --> 00:17:26.950
even more so in this
kind of draws back to

299
00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:34.330
my interests in building a
desktop application that makes research

300
00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:37.930
and data science accessible to
common people. I'm interested in

301
00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:42.850
making sure that non technical
people or semi-technical people have

302
00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:45.820
an understanding of what data
science is and what machine

303
00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:49.150
learning is and what its
role in our world is

304
00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:54.240
cause it's everywhere. And the
scariest thing for me is

305
00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:57.630
to live in a world
where machines are doing things

306
00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:01.620
that impact us, that we
don't understand. So I work

307
00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:04.680
hard to kind of teach
people about machine learning and

308
00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:08.730
I do free workshops in
Chicago and all that fun

309
00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:11.460
stuff, because I don't want
the robots to take over

310
00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:19.910
Skynet, preventing Skynet is so
that's interesting because you're, you're

311
00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:23.450
saying that it's open source.
That is the thing that

312
00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:28.640
will prevent us from taking
these, these, this software for

313
00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:31.100
granted. Like if you know
what it's doing, you don't

314
00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:33.500
have as much fear over
that thing. Yeah. And it

315
00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:35.420
doesn't even have to be
open source if you just

316
00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:38.510
have an understanding of how
it works, that can go

317
00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:43.340
a long way to making
you feel comfortable and making

318
00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:48.560
sure that you're a more
mindful internet user. So I,

319
00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:51.260
I would hope that like
in the future, everyone in

320
00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:53.840
the world would understand how
search engines work and how

321
00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:57.920
ads work and how Facebook's
newsfeed works. But the reality

322
00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:01.700
is that most internet users
don't know that. And that's

323
00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:05.600
really alarming to me. Hmm.
Backing up a little bit

324
00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:08.360
and talking more about interact.
You called out very clearly

325
00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:11.990
that there's the electron front
end. And then you referred

326
00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:16.610
to this Colonel concept. And
when I initially set up

327
00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:20.930
interact on my machine, it
said, you know, not connected.

328
00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:23.900
What is the difference between
the kernel and the, what

329
00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:25.520
does that was that concept?
Cause kernel is kind of

330
00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:29.660
an overloaded term. Yeah, it
is. Colonel kind of is

331
00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:32.510
one of those really technical
terms and it seems scary

332
00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:36.350
and frightening. And I would
encourage everyone. Who's listening to

333
00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:40.310
go to my website, which
is safia.rocks. I've got a

334
00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:44.870
talk that explains how colonels
work and how the entire

335
00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:48.950
Jupiter messaging protocol works. But
to give a brief summary

336
00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:53.570
of it, a Colonel is
essentially a program that runs

337
00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:56.570
either on your local machine
or in a remote server

338
00:19:56.990 --> 00:20:02.060
that has the ability to
take messages as input, parse

339
00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:04.040
them, figure out what to
do with them and send

340
00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:06.740
a response back. Okay. So
this is in the context

341
00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:10.010
of a Jupiter Colonel. Yes.
The context of a Jupiter

342
00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:13.190
Colonel. And so what would
happen is you open interact?

343
00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:15.860
Let's say, and you're working
in Python and you've got

344
00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:21.560
your code cell, you type
in print. Hello world. Okay.

345
00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:24.890
And if you have a
Python kernel installed on your

346
00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:27.230
machine, that's the one catch
you do have to install

347
00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:29.990
a Colonel since is it
a program what's going to

348
00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:32.600
happen is that the frontend
is going to take the

349
00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:36.110
code that you wrote, package
it into a little message,

350
00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:40.280
send it over via zero
MQ, which is a messaging

351
00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:43.850
protocol to the Colonel. The
Colonel is going to take

352
00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:46.970
that message, parse it out,
figure out what you want

353
00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:48.850
me want it to do
with it, and then send

354
00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:51.850
the response back to you
to render. And that response

355
00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:55.330
would be the text hello
world. So it's just a

356
00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:59.110
way for a frontend and
backend to communicate with each

357
00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:02.940
other. Okay. So then that
means that as a.net developer,

358
00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:05.670
if I wanted to make
an interact notebook, I could

359
00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:10.200
theoretically figure out if there
is a binding for a.net

360
00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:12.300
and zero MQ. And it
turns out of course, that

361
00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:15.420
there is one that's been
around for many years and

362
00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:18.180
then I could type C
sharp code or F sharp

363
00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:21.150
code or whatever makes me
happy. And then have that

364
00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:24.540
one process, which is my,
basically my server side, but

365
00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:28.560
it's really local to me.
Yeah, exactly. And you could

366
00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:32.100
do that with multiple programming
languages. There's a rich community

367
00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:36.690
of kernels in the Jupiter
ecosystem. So the popular ones

368
00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:40.710
like Python and Julia and
our exist, I'm a bit

369
00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:43.170
of a list piggyback. So
there is a common list

370
00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:48.990
kernel for those who are
curious, there's Ruby kernels, there's

371
00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:52.920
Haskell kernels. There's tons. If
you go around, you're guaranteed

372
00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:55.920
to find a kernel for
the programming language that you're

373
00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:58.140
excited about. Or if you
want to, you can like

374
00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:01.200
build on and give back
to the community. And is

375
00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:03.840
that some is the kernel.
Something like it doesn't come

376
00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:05.820
with the Colonel, you get
that separately and you have

377
00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:07.860
to run it separately. Yeah.
It doesn't come with the

378
00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:10.860
currently have to get it
separately. We are working on

379
00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:15.120
erotic to integrate the desktop
application with some default kernels.

380
00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:19.020
It goes back to kind
of making it a low

381
00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:21.630
technical barrier for users so
that you don't have to

382
00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:25.650
install anything anymore. It just
kind of all comes in

383
00:22:25.650 --> 00:22:29.610
one with a basic kernel
to start. You could even

384
00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:32.580
have a Colonel gallery. And
I, you know, from within

385
00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:37.590
interact, say, go and get
me, you know, Oh, that's

386
00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:40.680
an interesting idea. Because for
example, if I load up

387
00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:42.930
interact right now, it says
not connected. And it's like,

388
00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:44.760
well, gosh, what are my
choices? What are my options?

389
00:22:45.150 --> 00:22:47.940
I went to the file
menu, looking for like examples

390
00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:51.150
and stuff like that. So
I started out looking at

391
00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:53.190
there's an intro one and
it's really kind of cool.

392
00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:55.860
It's like a web browser,
but you'll have a bunch

393
00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:57.510
of texts and you'll have
images and you're like, Oh,

394
00:22:57.510 --> 00:23:00.450
I'm on the web, but
then there's code and it's

395
00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:03.150
right there. And it's, it's
syntax highlighted and it can

396
00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:07.800
be run in place. Yeah.
It's super fun. Super fun.

397
00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:10.230
And do you, do you
find yourself using this for

398
00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:12.120
you? Do you mostly work
on it or do you

399
00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:14.760
actually use it when you're
trying to explore a problem

400
00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:17.130
from a data perspective? A
little bit of both. I

401
00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:20.970
work on it sometimes when
I use it, I get,

402
00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:24.030
it is an alpha project
currently. So when I use

403
00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:25.710
it, I'll find a bug
and then I'll like get

404
00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:28.170
distracted and end up fixing
the bug instead of working

405
00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:30.990
on the thing I was
supposed to work on. But

406
00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:33.480
like I said before, I
do teach data science workshops.

407
00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:36.540
So I use it regularly
now to create the content

408
00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:40.470
for my workshops in the
form of an interactive notebook.

409
00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:43.530
Well, that's interesting. So then
are you saying that one

410
00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:46.550
could sit down in data
science one Oh one set

411
00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:49.310
this up and spend, you
know, a couple of weeks

412
00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:52.400
exploring everything and this is
their, this is the browser.

413
00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:54.440
This is the word and
Excel and everything all in

414
00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:58.090
one place. Yeah. That's actually
a really great, perfect use

415
00:23:58.090 --> 00:24:01.810
case for it is for
students. One of the biggest

416
00:24:01.810 --> 00:24:04.720
deterrents for a lot of
people who want to learn

417
00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:09.190
programming or learn something technical
is the setup involved, which

418
00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:14.680
can be pretty complex sometimes,
but Jupiter is super easy

419
00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:19.180
or sorry, interact and Jupiter
as well, which is the

420
00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:23.110
grandpa is super easy to
kind of load up an

421
00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:28.810
access. And do you see
this as an IDE? Is

422
00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:32.170
this like the visual studio
for data science and people

423
00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:34.150
would live and work and
spend eight hours in this

424
00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:37.900
thing? I wouldn't call it
an IDE. I don't think

425
00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:42.910
you would use it for
development per se. I think

426
00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:46.300
a better name for it
might be an ice and

427
00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:51.580
interactive communication environment. And the
idea is that you can

428
00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:56.530
write content in this and
write code cells. You wouldn't,

429
00:24:56.530 --> 00:24:59.770
you know, start off and
write a huge Python code

430
00:24:59.770 --> 00:25:03.670
file in this. That's probably
better for Adam or VIM

431
00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:07.180
or whatever code editor you're
comfortable with. But when you're

432
00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:10.840
looking to integrate a lot
of pros and narrative with

433
00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:14.650
code, this is the perfect
environment. Ah, okay. So this

434
00:25:14.650 --> 00:25:16.810
gets me thinking about what
we're seeing in the world

435
00:25:16.810 --> 00:25:19.030
of news right now with
like the Washington post, the

436
00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:23.020
New York times, doing these amazing
interactive things. Someone has gone

437
00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:25.480
and written the scripts, done
the data science, and now

438
00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:29.470
it's time to translate that
into a format for normal

439
00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:34.120
humans. Yeah. So this brings
up a great point. There's

440
00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:38.800
a really popular use case
in journalism. Bus speed actually

441
00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:42.220
does a lot of great
journalism work and a lot

442
00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:44.320
of data driven journalism work.
And one of the things

443
00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:48.310
they do is release a
lot of their data journalism

444
00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:50.680
in the form of these
interactive notebooks. And you can

445
00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:55.150
find them on bus feeds,
get hub organization. So if

446
00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:57.010
you want it to maybe
a bus feed did a

447
00:25:57.010 --> 00:25:59.860
piece of journalism that you're
really curious about. You can

448
00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:03.190
go to their, get hub,
download the data file and

449
00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:05.380
then open it up and
interact and play with the

450
00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:09.670
data yourself and be your
own data journalist. Interesting. That's

451
00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:12.520
funny because with all due
respect to Buzzfeed, I don't

452
00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:14.560
necessarily have in the past
thought about them as being

453
00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:16.860
a news organization, but what
they are is a, a

454
00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:20.920
new digital organization and they're,
they are pushing the boundaries

455
00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:23.410
of what we think of
as being journalism. And they're

456
00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:27.610
playing into the whole kind
of interactive computing and illiterate

457
00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:32.350
coding experience. Very well. They're
good translators. So then these

458
00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:35.260
notebooks can be shared easily.
And when someone says, here

459
00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:38.380
are the facts, they could
write an article about it,

460
00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:39.940
or they can just say,
here's the notebook play with

461
00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:42.940
it yourself. Yeah. So one
of the things that we

462
00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:47.100
integrated into interact right now
is the ability to publish

463
00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:53.130
a notebook directly, to get
hub as a guest. And

464
00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:55.560
hopefully in the future, we'll
be able to add the

465
00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:58.440
ability to publish it to
a medium post or a

466
00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:02.610
WordPress blog or any other
kind of resource or web

467
00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:05.820
platform that you have. So
really does start to become

468
00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:10.790
a content authoring platform and
a communication platform. Being able

469
00:27:10.790 --> 00:27:13.490
to publish it to medium
would be, would definitely lower

470
00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:16.580
the barrier That is on
my to do list of

471
00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:18.140
things I want to do.
Cause it's a feature that

472
00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:21.290
I'm really excited about. I've
been meaning to start publishing

473
00:27:21.290 --> 00:27:25.910
a lot of my data
explorations online, but sometimes it's

474
00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:28.430
such a hassle taking a
notebook I've been working on

475
00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:31.340
and getting it to the
web, being able to just

476
00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:34.490
hit file, publish medium and
have it up would be

477
00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:37.760
amazing. No, I, I, I
do want to tease you

478
00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:40.010
a little bit because I've
never heard it pronounced kissed,

479
00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:41.150
and now I feel like
there's going to be a

480
00:27:41.150 --> 00:27:45.450
hard G soft G fight,
another gift gift, another gift.

481
00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:50.570
Yes. This is something I
constantly have. I pronounced Jif

482
00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:55.370
as Jif. And I guess
you're one of the Jif

483
00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:59.930
people. I just found you
Scott, we need to stick

484
00:27:59.930 --> 00:28:02.840
together because there are some
roll of gift people out

485
00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:07.220
there Just mean including the
event, including the inventor of

486
00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:10.220
the format, which is also
wrong. No. Oh my goodness.

487
00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:13.370
I can't believe it. Yeah.
But I say, I say

488
00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:16.550
just, I didn't know. And
I didn't want to be

489
00:28:16.550 --> 00:28:19.010
attacked by the hard G
crowd on the internet, but

490
00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:21.500
yeah, No, no, no. They're,
they're really a brutal crowd.

491
00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:23.420
In fact, they're probably going
to stop listening to the

492
00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:26.690
show now that they've had,
now that this interview is

493
00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:29.720
falling apart at the end,
now We've just discovered what

494
00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:32.090
a terrible person I am.
I pronounce things with a

495
00:28:32.090 --> 00:28:36.980
soft G. All right. So,
so what I'm hearing is

496
00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:40.820
that when you, when you
all decided to make interact,

497
00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:46.100
you wanted a nice desktop
experience with, you know, a

498
00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:49.190
native desktop experience. And it
looks great on windows and

499
00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:52.850
on Mac. Okay. You wanted
in app support, you wanted

500
00:28:52.850 --> 00:28:56.360
publishing sharing should be easy
and you didn't want it

501
00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:57.800
to feel like a terminal.
Cause it doesn't feel like

502
00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:00.040
a terminal. It feels like
you're writing a word document

503
00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:02.570
and there's just code in
the middle somewhere. And it

504
00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:05.930
really is quite minimalist. There's
no toolbar. It is almost

505
00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:08.540
like a, you know, speaking
of medium, it almost looks

506
00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:11.330
like medium except with data
and code in the middle

507
00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:14.990
of it. Yeah. It does
adopt the minimalist philosophy very

508
00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:17.990
well. And now you're saying
that you're gonna, you're gonna

509
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.020
do for the future. What's
the, what's the roadmap publishing

510
00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:24.050
the medium. What else are
you gonna add? Great question

511
00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:26.960
for anyone who's listening, you
can check out our get

512
00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:31.190
hub or we've got a
repository called initiatives and that

513
00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:33.650
lays out some of the
future plans for work we

514
00:29:33.650 --> 00:29:37.280
have on the project. I
can go through a couple

515
00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:39.890
of the big initiatives. The
first is real time collaboration.

516
00:29:40.610 --> 00:29:44.680
And that's in addition to
writing the stories ourselves, we

517
00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:48.250
often write the stories in
teams. And so wouldn't it

518
00:29:48.250 --> 00:29:51.130
be great if I could
open up a Jupiter notebook

519
00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:54.730
and interact and you could
open up the same notebook

520
00:29:54.790 --> 00:29:58.390
on your machine and we
can work together on it,

521
00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:02.350
the same way that we
would in Google docs or

522
00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:05.290
any other platform that has
real time collaboration in it.

523
00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:09.970
So that's one of our
being initiatives. Another is integration

524
00:30:09.970 --> 00:30:14.590
with get the version control
system. And that's because a

525
00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:16.960
lot of people want to
be able to track changes

526
00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:19.090
in the content they produce
and be able to back

527
00:30:19.090 --> 00:30:22.720
it up the same way
that you would code. So

528
00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:25.300
we want you to be
able to kind of add

529
00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:29.800
and commit straight from the
desktop interface to a get

530
00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:32.740
repository. And then perhaps have
it backed up on GitHub

531
00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:35.680
or Bitbucket to be shared
with your team in some

532
00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:39.940
way. Oh, one of our
other initiatives is I mentioned

533
00:30:41.050 --> 00:30:44.050
this is built using react.
So the idea is to

534
00:30:44.050 --> 00:30:50.020
expose all of the different
components that we use and

535
00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:54.430
interact. So the other people
can build their own interactive

536
00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:57.460
notebooks using our components. So
if you want to have

537
00:30:57.460 --> 00:30:59.770
a component, that's a code
cell in your project. You

538
00:30:59.770 --> 00:31:01.570
can pull it in. If
you want to have a

539
00:31:01.570 --> 00:31:03.930
component, that's a markdown cell.
You could pull it in

540
00:31:05.050 --> 00:31:07.300
any of the components you
have. We have would be

541
00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:13.420
publicly available as packages for
people to use. So those

542
00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:18.070
are three big initiatives, real
time get integration and then

543
00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:21.490
exposing a composable ecosystem for
other people to build on

544
00:31:21.490 --> 00:31:25.440
top of Very cool. And
so folks can check out

545
00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:35.220
interact@nteractinteract.io, and people can check
you out and your stuff@sophia.rocks.

546
00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:40.020
So rocks is actually your
top level domain. That's pretty

547
00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:44.100
fabulous. The best $10 I
ever spent. 10 bucks. Yeah.

548
00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:47.550
You know, there's some other
aspiring data scientists named Sophia

549
00:31:47.550 --> 00:31:49.200
out there who is pretty
mad at you right now.

550
00:31:49.410 --> 00:31:52.140
Oh gosh. Sorry. I hope
she's. I hope she doesn't

551
00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:55.560
pronounce G with a hard
G She's a hard G

552
00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:59.730
person and we don't care
about her. Thanks so much

553
00:31:59.730 --> 00:32:02.010
for chatting with me today.
Thank you for having me.

554
00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:05.160
This has been another episode
of Hanselminutes and we'll see

555
00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:06.180
you again next week.
