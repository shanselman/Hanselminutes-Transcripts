00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.480
In this episode, Scott explorers,
the LyncSys WRT five, four

11
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:21.320
GL packable router. Hi, this
is Carl Franklin and you're listening

12
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.320
to Hanselman. It's number six,
I'm here with Scott again,

13
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.710
and we're talking this week
about the links, this router,

14
00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.280
the mythical links, this router
that you can do all

15
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.100
sorts of things with, right?
Scott. Absolutely. You can pick

16
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.980
these guys up for next
to nothing. It's amazing. They

17
00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.110
still make them. And now
that they know they can

18
00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.050
be hacked, they've made many
versions of them. I've got

19
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.110
a version 1.1 and a
version two. You can flip

20
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.330
this little blue box over
and look underneath. It'll tell

21
00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.110
you the hardware version. And
then somewhere around version four,

22
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.070
they switched over from Linux
as their main OSTP to

23
00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.950
something called VxWorks and lowered
the memory. And they tried

24
00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.130
to make things really cheap
and people flipped out. People

25
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.410
were like, wow, I totally
can't hack into this now.

26
00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.040
And they, people were fearing
the death knell of this

27
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.180
device. And then they actually
came out with a, a

28
00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:14.480
WRT 54 G L the
Linux version. They basically brought

29
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.750
back that version for the
hackers. So what kind of

30
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.700
stuff can you do with
this? These are those little

31
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.830
blue boxes with the rabbit
ears in the backs. They're

32
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.840
very kind of distinct in
the way that they look

33
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.450
and they're just their little
routers and they've got two

34
00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.620
wireless antennas in the back
and underneath it all, though,

35
00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.890
this is a, a little
Linux machine. There's a really

36
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:41.270
interesting hacking guide@linuxelectrons.com shrink stir.com/c
one J that's a complete

37
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.930
hardware hacking guide where the
guy literally walked through step

38
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.920
by step, all the different
little chip details. He kind

39
00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.050
of pulls the thing apart
and basically reverse engineers, all

40
00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:55.580
the hardware, like what can
I re you know, what

41
00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.110
can I say, or what
can I mess around with?

42
00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.140
Wow, what kind of hacking
I'm talking about Maura's with

43
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.960
the, what can we do
with the software? But that

44
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.240
hacking guide is really interesting.
Other people have hooked up

45
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.300
like Pringles cans to the
antennas to try to boost

46
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.130
the wireless power. Really? Yeah.
I always found that messing

47
00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.600
around with antenna lengths does
weird things that are not

48
00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.310
always good. Sure. You can
buy an extended antenna for

49
00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.730
these things, but interestingly, the,
the firmware comes with a,

50
00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.520
I believe it's a default
value of 84 milliwatts and

51
00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.400
you can pump it up
to up to 240 milliwatts

52
00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.520
using these firmwares. One of
the firmwares that you can

53
00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.540
flash this with is called
hyper WRT, which is basically

54
00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.540
a fork of links. This
is owned firmware and they're

55
00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.760
their primary claim to fame
is the ability to pump

56
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.320
up the transmission so people
can cover much greater area

57
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:47.840
and break all sorts of
FCC Rules. Yeah. Great. So

58
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.810
There's a whole series of
firmware that is not official.

59
00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.120
Again, links are so sell
you these things, but they,

60
00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.310
they make sure that you're
aware that when you flash

61
00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.270
the firmware to something alternative,
it's on you. Yep. So

62
00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.160
this is actually great. You
say to yourself, why would

63
00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.990
they bother making this? Well,
they get to sell lots

64
00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.370
of hardware and they don't
have to support it. Well,

65
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.760
so it's the best of
both worlds, right? They sell

66
00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.310
it Bible in any way
for anything anybody does with

67
00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.610
it. So, right. Yeah. It's
just like a gun manufacturer.

68
00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.290
They sell you this hardware
and you do what you

69
00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.060
want to do with it.
And they, they don't have

70
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.400
to sweat it. So you
said there's about nothing you

71
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.010
can't do with it. What
are some really interesting things

72
00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.230
people have done? Let's start
with the mundane and get

73
00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.410
to the really outrageous Mundane
side. There's a really great

74
00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.210
website called link, says info.org
at shrink stir.com/c one B.

75
00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.610
And these guys have gone
to all of the effort

76
00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.280
to collect all of the
different kinds of firmware that

77
00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.700
are available for this particular
device. There's a number of

78
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.640
different, literally a dozen or
more different kinds of firmware.

79
00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.040
Most of them are either
based on one of three

80
00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.790
different branches. There's the main
stuff that links us did.

81
00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.890
There's something called open WRT,
that's an open source WRT

82
00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.400
and then there's various branches
off of that, that firmware.

83
00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:03.600
Then there's a company called
Sophia soft SPEA, soft and

84
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.710
various branches off of their
stuff. The, the mundane stuff,

85
00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:12.600
as you can take hyper
WRT and pump up the

86
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.710
power output of your device.
Nice. Now that basically means

87
00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:21.360
a longer range. Yeah. More
greater range of people can

88
00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.670
cover an entire culdesac or,
you know, the whole dead

89
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:26.670
end and give free wireless
to all of their neighbors.

90
00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.780
I see it adds additional
fields for things like port

91
00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.980
forwarding, Good for a restaurant
or something like that. Well,

92
00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.590
So that actually brings us
to a different topic. There's

93
00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:39.690
a thing called a captive
portal. You know how when

94
00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.450
you show up somewhere and
you look at your wireless

95
00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.600
configuration, it says, Oh, there's
a wireless hotspot nearby, right?

96
00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.090
I'll click on that. I
get an IP address. And

97
00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:49.920
as soon as I launch
a browser and I go

98
00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.670
to cnn.com, it does a
redirect and it captures me,

99
00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.310
it's called a captive portal
and it will send me

100
00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:59.390
off somewhere to, in, or
do whatever I want. Right.

101
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:02.630
There is an open source
captive portal called chili spot,

102
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:06.020
C H I L L
I spot chili spot that

103
00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:10.610
you can use along with
a firmware called DD WRT,

104
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:15.050
it's shrink, stir.com/ <inaudible>. And
these two products working in

105
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.840
conjunction with each other. You
can have you put together

106
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:20.750
a, a, a captive portal,
so you could give free

107
00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.480
wireless to your entire neighborhood,
but only if they have

108
00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.240
names and passwords. So then
you could charge your neighbors.

109
00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:28.540
And then when the government
calls, you can hand over

110
00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:32.140
that information and makes lots
of friends. Yeah. The government

111
00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:36.100
or your ISP, some ISP
is allow sharing. Some of

112
00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:40.240
the smaller ISP will allow
sharing as a way of

113
00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:46.390
distinguishing themselves. And there's a
wiki@personaltelco.net or shrinks.com/ <inaudible>. That

114
00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:49.000
has a list of all
the different ISP and whether

115
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.790
or not they promote the
sharing of your connection with

116
00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:56.590
your neighbors. Wow, cool. Now
there's a larger worldwide group

117
00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:00.250
that has got custom firmware
called phone Fon. I think

118
00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:04.690
it's phone. It might be
fun@fon.com and you can go

119
00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:07.840
up there, download firmware and
become a full narrow. That's

120
00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.240
their word for someone who
is in their club. And

121
00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:15.340
this is a worldwide name,
password club where anyone else

122
00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:18.850
running this firmware, you will
automatically connect to. So I

123
00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:20.920
can just so cool. Isn't
it cool. I could show

124
00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.810
up in Brooklyn. I could
sit down. I could say,

125
00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:26.410
Oh, there's other phone people
out in this area, and

126
00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:28.870
they've also got an online
map. That'll show you where

127
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:30.790
all these different hotspots are.
And they're trying to basically

128
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:34.720
blanket the earth with these
things in a free wireless.

129
00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:37.420
Very cool. So, you know,
so if you're a restaurant

130
00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:40.300
or a coffee house, coffee
shop, and you have wireless,

131
00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:43.840
you could, you could put
that firmware in your router

132
00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:45.670
and put a little sticker
on the window that says

133
00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:49.480
we're a phone friendly shop.
Absolutely, absolutely. You know, and

134
00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:50.650
there were a lot of
people doing, you know, you

135
00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:52.930
know, what war driving is
when people get in their

136
00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:55.000
car and wander around looking
for stuff. And now with

137
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.150
GPS is there's lots of
really interesting websites that will

138
00:07:58.150 --> 00:07:59.890
show you whether or not
someone's actually driven by your

139
00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:03.160
house. And that works stumbler,
great tool. Yeah. Networks number

140
00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:05.650
and another evil and very
cool tool that people can

141
00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:07.780
do. Yeah. I've done that
with a tablet, go out

142
00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:10.630
with a tablet with networks,
somewhere in it. We ought

143
00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:13.150
to talk about network stumbler
a little bit. Yeah. So,

144
00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:18.700
well, so network stumbler basically
listens to the underlying communications

145
00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:20.350
that are going back and
forth with your router and

146
00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:24.340
move the windows, wireless zero
configuration stuff out of the

147
00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:26.740
way. And when you're doing
network stumbler, you're going to

148
00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:29.380
be kicked off of your
current wireless network. And you'll

149
00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:32.500
be listening to that kind
of raw feed. Once I

150
00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:35.530
took a train from Seattle
to Portland and I left

151
00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:38.200
network stumbler on as well
as being attached to my

152
00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:41.560
GPS, I had a little
inexpensive Microsoft streets and trips,

153
00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:45.010
GPS, and it logged the
names of all the different

154
00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:50.380
open unsecured unencrypted networks that
were running around as I

155
00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:52.780
drove by. As I rather,
as I went by them

156
00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:56.760
on the train, That's amazing
shrinks for.com one Oh or

157
00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:00.090
net stumbler.com. I've I've used
this as well. Just so

158
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.610
you know, find out where,
how I was interested in

159
00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:06.570
knowing how many open ports
there were and, you know,

160
00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:10.530
between and within a span
of three towns, I found

161
00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:14.340
about 25 open networks. These
are just people who left

162
00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:18.000
their, you know, networks, totally
unsecured. He could sit outside

163
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.570
their house and hitch a
ride on their internet access.

164
00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:23.000
It's very disappointing. Actually, I
went to a friend's house

165
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.580
recently to set her machine
up and basically, you know,

166
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:27.560
just as all of us
nerds, do you go over,

167
00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:29.540
you run windows update. You
make sure they have all

168
00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:31.490
the raid latest patches and
you turn on the firewall.

169
00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:33.500
And then they think that
you're great. I went over

170
00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:35.300
to a friend's house and
did this and was really

171
00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:39.590
disappointed that the SSI ID,
the identifier for her wireless

172
00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:42.860
network was customer and her
name and password was admin

173
00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:46.340
one, two, three, four, and
the person who set up

174
00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:49.880
her wireless network from the
local Comcast affiliate didn't set

175
00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:52.490
up any security at all.
She was broadcasting throughout the

176
00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:55.940
entire building. Wow. And probably
not just internet traffic, her

177
00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:58.790
own personal traffic too. Yeah.
She had no firewall turned

178
00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:00.650
on. So it was very
easy to go to network

179
00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:03.500
neighborhood and find her machine
wide open. And, but that's

180
00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:05.990
unfortunate. Let's get back to
Kind of basics to make

181
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:08.030
sure that folks are clear.
What's going on here. We've

182
00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:11.450
got this links us router
that in itself has a

183
00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:13.610
little Linux machine. It doesn't
have a hard drive, but

184
00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:16.520
it does have memory. And
just like you can flash

185
00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:19.520
firmware on a number of
devices like your pocket PC

186
00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:23.120
or your, your replay TV
or any kind of appliance.

187
00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:26.240
This means to look like
an appliance, but it really

188
00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:29.120
is a little computer. I
mean, you can really log

189
00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:32.870
into this Linux machine using
something like putty, P U

190
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:36.950
T T Y at shrinks.com/
<inaudible>. This is like Telnet,

191
00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:41.420
but with security, you can
putty into this device, log

192
00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:44.270
in as root and do
an LS, you know, like

193
00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:47.630
the Linux equivalent of DIR
and really see what's going

194
00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:49.970
on. And there's configuration files.
There's a little web server.

195
00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:51.950
It is a real little
machine. You should talk a

196
00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:54.620
little bit about SSH. This
is something me as a

197
00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:57.170
windows guy didn't know about
until a friend of mine

198
00:10:57.170 --> 00:11:00.620
told me, yeah, H is
a thing called secure shell.

199
00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.810
And this is a program
that you would use to

200
00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:08.210
log into another computer, kind
of like Telnet, but this

201
00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:12.860
is specific to Linux machines
and it's, it's intended as

202
00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:16.010
a replacement for Telnet and
our log in and all

203
00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:18.350
these different things that would
allow you to connect to

204
00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:22.070
another machine. For example, SourceForge
where I store some of

205
00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:24.890
the open source things that
I do. You can get

206
00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:28.340
secure shell access and get
access to your file system.

207
00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:35.780
And SSH supports various encryption
algorithms like triple Dez, Blowfish

208
00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:40.520
two it's it's highly secure
shelling into, it's not wide

209
00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:42.320
open, like, like telling it,
and you can set up

210
00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:46.190
keys and two way security
to make sure that only

211
00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:49.820
you can SSH into your
particular machine potty is the

212
00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:51.980
tool that you would use
on windows to, to do

213
00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:55.810
that. So you get one
of these devices and you

214
00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:58.180
put it onto your network
and you go and you

215
00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:00.550
fire up a web browser
and you visit one 90

216
00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:04.780
two.one 60 eight.one.one, and you
get a nice a website

217
00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:08.140
and it says links us.
And everything's great under administration.

218
00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:11.110
There's a section that says
upgrade firmware. You can go

219
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:13.360
to one of these sites.
The one I would suggest

220
00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.730
to start with is links
as info.org. The one we

221
00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:21.010
mentioned before shrinks.com/ <inaudible> and
decide what are you trying

222
00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:23.740
to get out of your,
your router experience? If you

223
00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:26.350
just want the basics, but
a little bit more go

224
00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:31.330
hyper WRT. If you want
a lot of support and

225
00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:33.850
are willing to pay for
it via soft, we'll charge

226
00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:35.950
you 20 bucks, but they
have, even though it's a

227
00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:39.010
free thing, they'll charge you
20 bucks for support. Some

228
00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:41.770
people have a problem with
some of their open source

229
00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:44.890
practices, and we'll use a
thing called D D dash

230
00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:48.820
WRT instead, which is an
opensource version where you can

231
00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:51.460
donate to the gentlemen, but
it is still a free

232
00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:55.570
process. I use personally this
DD WRT. I think that's

233
00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:59.800
a really great one. You
can see that@shrinks.com slash <inaudible>,

234
00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:04.480
that particular firmware, you just
download a zip file. You

235
00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:06.910
it's a dot bin. So
it's just this big binary

236
00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:10.720
blob from the website. You
basically say browse, you select

237
00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:13.510
that file. And you say
update, you always want to

238
00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:15.550
make sure that you do
your update over a wired

239
00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:19.180
connection, because if your wireless
connection goes down while you're

240
00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:21.970
doing this upgrade, you can
do what's called bricking your

241
00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:24.490
router. And if you brick
it, that means it's basically

242
00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:27.070
dead. Not you can't get
into it. Well, not completely

243
00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:31.560
dead. It's it's bricked. So
there's actually a, The way

244
00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:34.230
that you can. <inaudible> there's
a thing called the WRT

245
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:40.110
revival guide@shrink.com slash <inaudible>. And
this revival guide has a

246
00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:43.050
step by step details on
how you can use some

247
00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:47.040
low level protocols and some
safety pins to bring back

248
00:13:47.040 --> 00:14:00.930
your device from the dead.

00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:52.370
different modules to test all
your applications. Test complete is

261
00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:56.900
a full test development environment.
It has features like an

262

easy to use windows test
recorder that auto creates test

263
00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:04.700
scripts and an advanced script
editor with features like syntax

264
00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:10.730
highlighting code completion, and context
sensitive help. It has test

265

execute a lightweight utility for
running distributed tests and test

266
00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:20.510
recorder, a library for building
tests into your application. And

267
00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:23.780
if you plan on using
visual studio 2005 team system

268
00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:27.650
test complete integrates nicely with
it and adds a new

269
00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:31.940
test to complete test type.
So do yourself a favor

270
00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:46.880
and download a free evaluation
copy of test complete@automatedqa.com. Now,

271
00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:51.410
does this also allow anybody
to completely hack into one

272
00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:54.340
of these devices that doesn't
have a password? So, So

273
00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:56.470
as with all of these
things, they use kind of

274
00:15:56.470 --> 00:16:00.910
the same underlying concepts. So
once you upgrade you post

275
00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:03.700
this form and it's all
done over the web, you're

276
00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:07.480
basically uploading that dot Ben
file. And you'll be you'll

277
00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:09.610
rehab to reset your router.
The next step you'll do

278
00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:13.240
is you'll reboot your router.
After that, if you've reset

279
00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:15.760
the firmware to the factory
default, yet it will actually

280
00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:19.060
change your name and password
back to the defaults. You

281
00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:21.520
always want to update your
name and your password to

282
00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:25.150
something that's not admin and
password. So the moral of

283
00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:29.230
the story is, you know,
keeping the box physically locked

284
00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:32.140
under lock and key is
always the best policy, Whether

285
00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:35.320
or not you're using default
firmware. You definitely need to

286
00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:38.380
be aware that your machine
should be secured with a

287
00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:42.340
strong password. Absolutely. Yeah. So
once you upgrade these to

288
00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:45.520
whatever firmware that you want,
you then visit the exact

289
00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:48.250
same a web interface. And
you'll see some of the

290
00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:51.280
new features that have been
exposed. Some of the things

291
00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:54.820
that one might want over
the default are port forwarding

292
00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:57.190
that we mentioned before, but
the really important one that

293
00:16:57.190 --> 00:17:00.010
I think doesn't get enough,
publicity is the thing called

294
00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:03.550
QoS or quality of service.
Yeah, let's talk about that.

295
00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:08.860
So I use Vontage right.
fonagy.com. That's the telephone service

296
00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:11.470
that lets you run all
of your main line telephones

297
00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:14.920
over the internet. Most people
just get the Vonage box,

298
00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:17.590
they plug any old phone
into it and they forget

299
00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:19.870
about it. But I already
had a bunch of existing

300
00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:22.690
phones in my house. So
I went outside to where

301
00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:25.900
the phone wire comes from
the street from my local

302
00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:28.870
phone company. And I cut
it. I cut it as

303
00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:30.940
it came into the house
and I covered it in

304
00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:32.860
tape. And I put a
note inside the phone box,

305
00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:37.090
telling Verizon my phone company
to not reconnect this wire.

306
00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:40.570
So now at this point,
my house is completely off

307
00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:43.210
the grid and the, and
the copper phone wire sense

308
00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:45.340
of the word, right? I
have a single wire running

309
00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:47.680
from the outside where it's
cut off all the way

310
00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:50.790
through the house to a
bedroom where eventually stops. Yeah,

311
00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:53.010
I've take my Vontage and
I plug it into my

312
00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:57.210
ethernet. And then I take
my RJ 11, the tiny

313
00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:59.640
phone cable that we're all
used to. I plug it

314
00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:04.140
from the Vonage box directly
back into the house. Then

315
00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:08.220
that fills the house with
phone support directly through Vonage

316
00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:11.070
and all my existing phone
jacks are on Vonage. Yep.

317
00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:13.200
The key, the disconnecting of
the phone on the outside's

318
00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:16.110
really important. Otherwise you'll, you'll
fry your Vonage box with

319
00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:18.540
that voltage. And what was
happening though, is I would

320
00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:21.150
go and start doing bit
torn. I download dotnet rocks

321
00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:23.760
over bit torn, or I
download an ISO image from

322
00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:26.970
Microsoft and suddenly my wife
would get kicked off the

323
00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:30.420
phone. I needed quality of
shirt of service. I needed

324
00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:33.780
an assurance that my wife's
phone call was more important

325
00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:37.140
than my big ass download,
right? So I can go

326
00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:41.940
into this a firmware like
either Sofia soft or DDRT

327
00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:43.650
or any of the other
ones that exposed some of

328
00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:46.560
that QoS. And some of
the newer links as default

329
00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:50.280
firmwares also have some kind
of quality of service that

330
00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:53.220
I can do quality service
based on either physical port,

331
00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:56.250
like let this box that's
plugged into port number two,

332
00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:58.830
be more important than that
one. I can do it

333
00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:02.430
by Mac address this unique
identifier, regardless of its IP

334
00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:07.880
address deserves more respect By
protocol QoS. This is this

335
00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:09.890
just a bit, or is
the, are there different levels

336
00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:13.160
of priority? Ah, there are
as many levels of priority

337
00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:16.460
as that firmware chooses to
express on the links, this

338
00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:22.340
boxes they've got bulk express
standard and premium. So premium

339
00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:25.100
is basically like this absolutely
requires, you know, this is

340
00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:28.610
so important, make it happen
and bulk is get it

341
00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:30.500
there when you get it
there. Yeah. So it's nice

342
00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:33.170
to have at least a
few, few different choices. So

343
00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:35.510
if you have a couple
of different protocols going on,

344
00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:38.870
you can stratify them. Exactly.
And for what I needed

345
00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:42.170
in my house, I said,
this Mac address, the Mac

346
00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:45.200
address of my Vontage box
is so important. It's premium.

347
00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:49.430
All traffic get behind this
guy. Yeah. Well, BitTorrent I

348
00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:51.500
said was bulk. I don't
ever want a bit torrent

349
00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:55.970
pushing my wife off the
phone. Yup. HTTPS. I made

350
00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:58.280
it express a little bit
better than standard. It was

351
00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.410
important. I don't want to
have my credit card get

352
00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:03.410
kicked off because of something
else. Right. FTP, lower to

353
00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:06.470
bulk. And one of the
nice things about DDRT is

354
00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:08.930
it has a huge list
of different protocols that it

355
00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:10.730
can make decisions about. So
you can say, well, I

356
00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:14.720
want my Xbox live to
get the best possible service

357
00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:18.140
guarantee and I can do
it by protocol, regardless of

358
00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:21.020
how many Xboxes I have
in the house. That's nice.

359
00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:23.480
It is nice. Some of
the other things that you

360
00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:26.030
can do are like port
forwarding. So I have a,

361
00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:29.210
a replay TV. I've got
actually two of them. This

362
00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:34.220
is a, like a TV
<inaudible> Yeah, no, it's not

363
00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:36.800
a software TiVo. It's replay
TV. It's the one that

364
00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:39.110
you were talking about beyond
TV. I'm sorry. I have

365
00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:41.030
one of those, Those two,
but my replay TV replay

366
00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:43.610
TV is the TV. Oh,
that didn't happen. Right? Right.

367
00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:45.980
It's the Betamax of TiVo.
It's better, but no one's

368
00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:48.430
gonna use it. Right. So
there's a really interesting thing

369
00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:52.600
called <inaudible> P O O
P L. I it's basically

370
00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:55.600
a sharing network for replay
people because the replay TV

371
00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:59.740
allows you to FTP television
shows to your neighbors. Oh

372
00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:01.870
cool. Now it's not meant
in a Napster kind of

373
00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:05.200
stealing a television kind of
a way, because you can

374
00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.570
only send it one hop.
You can send it to

375
00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:10.660
your neighbor or your mom
and that's it from there,

376
00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:12.910
from there, you can watch
it or stop it. So

377
00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:17.230
the replay TV though, was
designed before you UPNP universal

378
00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:19.780
plug and play. And Nat
traversal were really a big

379
00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:22.570
deal. So you actually have
to punch a hole in

380
00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:25.570
your firewall. I don't want
my replay TVs living outside

381
00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:28.360
my firewall. So I went
and picked a high high

382
00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:31.330
up port, you know, 24,000
and something. And then I

383
00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:34.540
can go into my firmware
and say that Mac address,

384
00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:38.470
the unique identifier of my
replay gets this IP address.

385
00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:43.300
That's called basically statically allocating
DHCP. So I can say

386
00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:45.880
that it will always get
that IP address. And then

387
00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:48.490
I punch a hole in
my, in my firewall just

388
00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:50.530
for that one port and
just for the replay TV.

389
00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:52.450
And then I go to
<inaudible> dot com and I

390
00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:55.420
can say, Oh shoot, I
missed desperate Housewives last week.

391
00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:57.190
Can you send it to
me? And it will be

392
00:21:57.190 --> 00:22:01.060
sent over that particular port,
just to my replay. It's

393
00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:03.010
not a major hole in
my firewall and I can

394
00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:05.500
also set quality of service
or that multi gig file

395
00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:10.200
doesn't cause me any trouble.
Wow. That's pretty cool. So

396
00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:12.780
<inaudible> dot com. Is this
a place where you can,

397
00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:15.300
if you have a set
Play TV, you can go

398
00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:17.700
to <inaudible> dot com and
sign up. It works for

399
00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:21.810
4,500 series or 5,000 series
replay TVs. And it's just

400
00:22:21.810 --> 00:22:24.270
a place to meet people
so that you can send

401
00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:27.120
shows back and forth to
each other. Not to be

402
00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:28.980
clear, it's not a file
sharing site. It's just a,

403
00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:30.750
I missed that show. Can
you send it to me

404
00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:34.380
site? Okay. Is that legal
by the way? Well, here's

405
00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:36.720
the thing. One of the
reasons that replay TV has

406
00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:38.400
not made a lot of
friends is because of stuff

407
00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:42.030
like this, but poopy.com doesn't
do anything that owning a

408
00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:44.670
replay TV doesn't already allow
you to do. Okay. It

409
00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:47.070
just lets you meet more
people. I see. If you

410
00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:48.720
had a replay TV and
I had one, we could

411
00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:51.390
share files just cause I
know you, Oh, I see.

412
00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:53.370
It's just a meetup. It's
a way to meet more

413
00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:56.340
people. And it also has
a web services interface. So

414
00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:59.400
it'll actually take the information
off your replay and upload

415
00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:01.590
it and put it in
a shared catalog. So I

416
00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:06.450
can search for all the
different shows available and say,

417
00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:08.850
Oh, this guy I've never
met before, has that episode

418
00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:11.490
of desperate Housewives, can you
send it to me? So

419
00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:14.040
replay TV sounds pretty awesome.
How come it didn't take

420
00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:17.630
off The interface. Wasn't friendly
and didn't go boop, boop

421
00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:20.010
blue or whatever the <inaudible>
did. It didn't have thumbs

422
00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:21.870
up and thumbs down. I
mean, TiVo has a great

423
00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:25.590
interface. TiVo is TiVo was
windows and replay. TV is

424
00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:30.060
Linux and one is pretty
and one is not. I

425
00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:31.920
love my replay TV. There's
all sorts of great stuff

426
00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:33.600
you can do with a
replay TV. There's another, if

427
00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:35.670
you want to see what
a replay TV's like from

428
00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:38.850
a networking standpoint, there's a
really interesting thing called DV

429
00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:44.100
archive.org, digital video archive. It's
a Java implementation of a

430
00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:47.600
replay TV. So I've actually
got two replays and I've

431
00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.880
got one upstairs and one
downstairs. So I can be

432
00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:53.480
downstairs watching a television show
from upstairs, but the replays

433
00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:57.410
have limited space with DVR
archive. I can simulate a

434
00:23:57.410 --> 00:24:02.900
software replay TV and use
my machine as unlimited space

435
00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:05.410
for my shows. Now that
means you also have to

436
00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:08.230
have video recording equipment on
your machine. Well, if I

437
00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:11.200
join <inaudible> dot com and
tell them I have a

438
00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:14.260
replay and point them to
my DVR archive, Oh I

439
00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:17.800
see. Then I can be
receiving, but not sending, but

440
00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:21.400
poopy.com does keep track of
a ratio if you're receiving

441
00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:23.080
lots of shows and not
sending them the note they'll

442
00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:25.960
think that you're a Leacher.
Yeah. And you are. Absolutely.

443
00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:29.170
So do any of these
Linux firmwares make working with

444
00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:33.070
UPNP any easier? Yeah, they
do actually the, the latest

445
00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:37.240
version of DD WRT version
23 that I just downloaded

446
00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:41.620
has an optimized for gaming
button that basically takes care

447
00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:44.170
of the kind of compatibility
that you'd expect to work

448
00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:48.880
with Xbox live and also
has a UPNP page that

449
00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:52.030
was not present on the
default firmware that lets you

450
00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:55.900
see what applications within your
house have requested a hole

451
00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:59.170
punched in the firewall. I
noticed as I was seeding

452
00:24:59.170 --> 00:25:01.540
bit Torrens for you using
that as, as a Russ

453
00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:06.400
<inaudible>, as Zuri has had
requested two ports open and

454
00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:08.790
I got to see it
in that table. Now there,

455
00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:11.440
there is a rumor that
there are some UPNP problems

456
00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:14.710
with DD WRT version 23,
and you can look at

457
00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:16.930
that up at the forums.
But I personally haven't seen

458
00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:19.360
those and I found it
really interesting to, to hit

459
00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:22.030
refresh on that page and
see the different things within

460
00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:25.720
the, within my house, including
BitTorrent or my Xbox that

461
00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:29.140
have requested holes in my
firewall. Yeah. That's nice to

462
00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:31.240
see. It really is. All
right. So what else do

463
00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:33.970
you got for us tonight?
So one of the things

464
00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:36.640
that's important to note about
these link links, this boxes

465
00:25:36.670 --> 00:25:39.790
that is I found it
a little difficult. I had

466
00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:44.440
to dig for this. They're
not really PNP aware. They're

467
00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:48.670
not really ideal for lots
of connections. You know, I

468
00:25:48.670 --> 00:25:52.450
seed bit for you because
we want to help the

469
00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:55.390
band without, for DNR TV.
And I started getting lots

470
00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:57.940
of errors on my firewall.
Recently when I started seeding

471
00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:00.670
this, it turned out that
the number of connections that

472
00:26:00.670 --> 00:26:03.790
this this device can track
by default was limited to

473
00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:07.420
512. It turns out you
can use potty, you can

474
00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:11.110
look, go into a terminal
and you can say NV

475
00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:15.370
Ram, like nonvolatile Ram, you
can say NV Ram, get

476
00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:19.090
RC underscore startup. And you
can see a startup script,

477
00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:21.580
basically an auto exec bat
that your little router runs

478
00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:25.810
through. And you can make
changes in there using echo,

479
00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:28.240
just like a, an endorser
where you can echo something

480
00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:31.330
and then use the greater
than symbol to push it

481
00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:34.510
into a file. And you
can update as part of

482
00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:37.870
this auto exec process that
the router goes through a

483
00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:40.810
lot of the different settings
that aren't necessarily made available.

484
00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:43.030
I'm going to put these
up on my blog, but

485
00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:48.810
basically upped the connections to
4,096. And I also lowered

486
00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:53.550
the connection tracking timeouts, typically
TCP on these routers will

487
00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:57.000
keep connections open for hours
and hours. But with BitTorrent,

488
00:26:57.060 --> 00:26:59.190
you know, if someone goes
away, I'd really like to

489
00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:01.830
kick them out within 10
minutes or so. Right. So

490
00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:03.480
I kind of came up
with a best practice. I

491
00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:05.760
found in about three different
forums and I'll blog about

492
00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:09.300
that soon. But I was
really just amazed that this

493
00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:11.460
little device was really a
computer. I mean, I know

494
00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:13.530
that intellectually, I can look
at it and see that

495
00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:16.620
this is a machine, but
you just don't expect to

496
00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:20.100
get a terminal prompt right
out of a little half

497
00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:23.900
pound piece of blue plastic.
It's pretty crazy stuff. Yeah.

498
00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:26.630
Well, you've always been able
to do that with routers

499
00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:29.080
like Cisco routers, but always
been able to tell them

500
00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:31.190
that into and mess around
with them and stuff. But

501
00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:35.390
I mean, having a complete
operating system in there is

502
00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:39.170
totally different thing. Right? See
to see the, you know,

503
00:27:39.170 --> 00:27:42.530
the Cisco funky command prompt
is one thing and it's

504
00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:46.280
so complicated. People get certified
on it too, to see

505
00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:49.640
a familiar file system and
say, wow, I actually can

506
00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:51.980
VI and I can use
some of my Linux skills

507
00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:55.580
to find my way around
this. These devices are basically

508
00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:58.700
you turning a $60 piece
of plastic into a many

509
00:27:58.790 --> 00:28:01.790
hundreds of dollars device. Yeah,
they are. There are other

510
00:28:01.790 --> 00:28:05.300
things you can do with
voiceover IP bridges. There are,

511
00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:09.620
you can make it a
wireless bridge. There's an article@shrinkstir.com

512
00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:14.570
slash <inaudible> dot com where
a guy used to have

513
00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:16.910
these devices and bridge them
together to make sure he

514
00:28:16.910 --> 00:28:20.450
could have full wireless coverage
over his entire house. Wow.

515
00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:22.850
There's really no limit to
what you can, you can

516
00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:25.550
do. And I like I
blogged about recently. I've got

517
00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:27.710
it set up where I
can VPN back into my

518
00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:31.940
house from hotel rooms. Excellent.
Yeah, that'd be PPN stuff

519
00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:39.500
is up at <inaudible> shrinks.com/
<inaudible> and you can set

520
00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:44.870
up a dynamic domain name
service using Dyn, dns.com. So

521
00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:47.360
if you have an IP
address on DSL or on

522
00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:50.150
cable modems that happens to
float or you don't always

523
00:28:50.150 --> 00:28:52.160
know what your IP address
is going to be, you

524
00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:54.350
can set up your own
custom, like I could be

525
00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:59.240
dotnet rocks dot dynamic, dns.com
and it would automatically update

526
00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:01.820
and the firmware will actually
make the web services call

527
00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:04.820
up to there and update
that information for you. I

528
00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:09.560
got a quick story about
dynamic DNS, Dyn, dns.com. My

529
00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:13.010
mother is all, you know,
just getting into the computer

530
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:16.160
the last couple of years.
And of course is learning

531
00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:20.090
very slowly, you know? And
so I've always found myself

532
00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:23.960
over there trying to, you
know, fix their printer or,

533
00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:27.260
you know, fix some program
that went awry and you

534
00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:29.180
know, it's a 15 minute
drive to get to her

535
00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:31.160
house. So I set her
up with a name at

536
00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:35.960
Dyn, dns.com and, and set
up VNC on it. And

537
00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:40.220
so then anytime that anytime
that I wanted to connect,

538
00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:42.730
I could just connect VNC
and She thought it was

539
00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:45.580
just like voodoo, what kind
of, what kind of OSTP

540
00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:49.600
was she running windows 2000
at the time. Wow. And

541
00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:52.180
now she's running XP, but
so now you can use

542
00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:55.230
the ask for remote assistant
stuff. Yeah. I still prefer

543
00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:58.420
VNC to that. However, got
a good password on that

544
00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:02.440
though, right? Yeah. Absolutely mentioning
that. You, you had said

545
00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:04.390
that she's on windows 2000
and you know, I had

546
00:30:04.390 --> 00:30:06.310
a similar problem recently where
I needed to connect to

547
00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:08.860
a windows 2000 machine and
I didn't want to go

548
00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:11.500
to the trouble of setting
up a VNC server. There's

549
00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:15.220
a really interesting service that
Joel Spolsky from fog Creek

550
00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:20.110
software has set up called
copilot.com where you basically go

551
00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:23.830
up, you pay five bucks
or 10 bucks. You, they

552
00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:27.100
give you a ticket number.
The person that needs help

553
00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:29.710
just go to their site,
copilot.com and enters in the

554
00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:34.600
ticket downloads program that they
run. It's basically a packaged

555
00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:38.230
version of VNC server. They
enter in the ticket number.

556
00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:41.590
They hit run. You do
the exact same thing on

557
00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:44.620
the client side. Oh, that's
nice. And they handle the

558
00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:48.490
natural, Vercel the network address
translation. So they'll actually broker

559
00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:50.700
that traffic. So even if
they're behind a firewall, they'll

560
00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:53.320
let you connect. They don't
have to install a service.

561
00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:55.690
They don't have to do
anything. And when you pay,

562
00:30:55.690 --> 00:30:59.110
you're paying for a ticket
for 24 hours, huh? It's

563
00:30:59.110 --> 00:31:02.710
a really neat thing. copilot.com.
This is the save that

564
00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:04.900
could save my life on
a couple of occasions. I

565
00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:08.020
could, I could have used
that. Definitely. And actually there,

566
00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:10.450
this project was written by
a bunch of interns. It

567
00:31:10.450 --> 00:31:14.470
was called project aardvark. If
you go up to video.google.com

568
00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:17.740
and search for project aardvark,
they're actually selling a video

569
00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:21.280
and DVDs about how all
of these interns built this

570
00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:24.430
thing and how they released
the source back to the

571
00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:27.880
public because VNC itself was,
opensourced interesting. If you want

572
00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:32.950
to know more about VNC,
go to ultra vnc.sf.net. And

573
00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:35.170
that's a tool that we
use a lot here, pop

574
00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:37.780
as well. Good stuff. All
right, Skye. Well, it's been

575
00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:40.180
a heck of a show.
Thanks a lot. Thank you.

576
00:31:40.450 --> 00:31:42.490
And we'll see you next
week on Hanselman.
