Hi, this is Scott Hanselman.
This is another episode of

16
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.270
Hansel minutes today. I'm talking
with Kristen Lee. She's a

17
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.030
UX research, right? Empowered and
a YouTuber. How are you?

18
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.770
Hey, I'm great, Scott. Thanks
for having me. Thanks for

19
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.110
coming on the show. I
found you while I was

20
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.790
frankly, Googling around and learning
about bootcamps because I'm interested

21
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.480
in how people find their
way into tech. And it

22
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.860
looks like you already had
a well-established YouTube channel. So

23
00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.900
were you a techie before
you went to a boot

24
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.200
camp? Not at all. Well,
I would say a little

25
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.950
bit from school. I have
a, I have a master's

26
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.910
in journalism from San Jose
state. So being in Silicon

27
00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:43.730
Valley, the journalism program incorporated
some app development and we

28
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.660
did some videography. So I
dabbled in that. But for

29
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.700
the most part, no, I
did not have a, a

30
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.540
solid foundation. It does kind
of raise the question though.

31
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.180
What is a techie? Like,
is it someone who can

32
00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.430
find a file on the
disc? Cause I constantly, I'm

33
00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.630
always having nontechnical family members
say I've lost this file

34
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.310
and it's like, Oh, well
they put it in documents

35
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.710
instead of download or it's
on the desktop. And then

36
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.500
they're amazed if I find
the file and then I

37
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.690
go, you're a techie. You
found that file. Like, what

38
00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.180
is the, what is the
base like how technical is

39
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.150
technical? Yeah, That's true. It
seems like a buzz word

40
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.190
today for anyone who knows
anything that is electronic bass

41
00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.090
Is configuring your own router,
like going to, going to

42
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.920
best buy buying a router
or setting it up. Is

43
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.180
that techie or is that
just following instructions? Well, And

44
00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.270
I think there's also like
a, a point where there's

45
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.090
a certain amount of nerdiness
within the techie, you know,

46
00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.910
there's like the hip techie
people and then more people

47
00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.700
who nerd out more. I
don't know. Yeah. Well, and

48
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.380
then there's like you were
saying that you've done like

49
00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.710
media creation, like there's the
Adobe creative cloud level of

50
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.180
techie, right? Yeah. Asset management
and rendering. And then there's

51
00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.070
the like coding techie. Definitely.
So you had a master's

52
00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.360
degree already. That's an advanced
degree. That's a graduate degree.

53
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.000
That's more than a lot
of people. Were you not

54
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.120
interested in being a journalist?
Why go to a bootcamp

55
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.980
and not do a master's
in computer science? I didn't

56
00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.350
know. I wanted to work
in tech to be honest.

57
00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.560
I, I kind of did
what I don't recommend those

58
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.470
people doing and which is
going back to school when

59
00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:20.940
you're still trying to figure
out what you want to

60
00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.360
do. Cause that does not
solve the answer at all.

61
00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:30.600
But that's pretty much what
I did after, after changing

62
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:36.120
my career path from physical
therapy, I decided to just

63
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.840
go for journalism. Cause it
seemed to just be something

64
00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.590
that you can apply to
any industry, which I guess

65
00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.140
is partially true for my
experience. But that's pretty much

66
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.020
the reason why I got
the masters and I don't

67
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.870
really need it. I, I
think if you go through

68
00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:57.090
coding bootcamp, especially nowadays, since
it's more common, that's absolutely

69
00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.570
fine. Really? Cause that brings
up an interesting question about

70
00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.900
how to position these things.
Because you know, currently as

71
00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.780
of the time of this
recording, the U S is

72
00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.650
at about 4% unemployment and
people would like to say,

73
00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.170
yeah, anyone with any tech
ability at all can just,

74
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.030
you know, throw a rock
and get a, get a

75
00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.510
job as a techie. Do
you think that having bootcamp

76
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.840
on your resume is more
important than having master's degree

77
00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:28.170
on your resume? I think
it depends on the type

78
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.790
of job position that you
want to have. And I

79
00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.420
often tell people that getting
a job after bootcamp is

80
00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.470
a lot different than actually
the studying and going through

81
00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.150
coding. And Buki, they're both
like two huge different journeys.

82
00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.450
Well, let's break down the,
the why a boot camp

83
00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.400
and the going through the
process. And then we'll, we'll

84
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.470
follow up with how we
go and get a job

85
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.990
after boot camp. So you
went and got a, you

86
00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.000
went, got a, went to
a boot camp. How did

87
00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.550
you pick that boot camp?
And how did you know

88
00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.410
that they were going to
succeed in teaching you what

89
00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:07.440
you wanted to learn? So
for picking the bootcamp, it

90
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.860
was overwhelming. Like many people.
I did a Google search.

91
00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.590
I looked at reviews, which
don't help you at all.

92
00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.020
Cause you always hear the
good and the bad and

93
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.490
typically it's more bad than
good. And I ended up

94
00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.330
narrowing down what I wanted
to do. So I thought

95
00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.570
I wanted to do more
front end development. So I

96
00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:32.160
focused on the bootcamps that
do that. And today there's

97
00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.960
a bazillion types of boot
camps. There's big data. There's

98
00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.310
dev ops. Now there's design
bootcamp. So that's number, one

99
00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.700
thing you need to do
first is decide where w

100
00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:49.320
decide what you want to
do after bootcamp. And we're

101
00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:56.430
choosing, I chose tech talent
South they're local. I I'm

102
00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:59.330
trying to go back. So
I was trying to decide

103
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:05.390
between tech talent, South, another
local boot camp and an

104
00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:09.200
online boot camp, because it
just seemed convenient to still

105
00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:13.160
do my full time job
and go to school. But

106
00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:18.080
I nixed that idea because
knowing myself and how I

107
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.760
learn, I need to be
in a classroom setting. And

108
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.060
if I just go ahead,
I'm sorry. I was going

109
00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.520
to say, it seems like
if you are a person

110
00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.650
who is trying to get
into tech and someone says,

111
00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:32.800
do an online bootcamp, the
assumption is you're already what

112
00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.800
they call a digital native,
right? You're already super comfortable

113
00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.070
online. But to the point
about before you could get

114
00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:41.560
stuck and then you're all
alone, you're online and you

115
00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.140
are stuck on an exercise
and now you have to

116
00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:45.550
go. And the only way
you can get help is

117
00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:49.750
email somebody. Yeah, definitely. And
they have mentors. I know

118
00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:54.670
some have they do a
like Skype with your mentor

119
00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:59.260
once a week or something.
But I having my teacher

120
00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.930
in person and then being
able to work with my

121
00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:07.090
classmates after class, like we
would get together and work

122
00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:09.520
on our projects over dinner.
We just call her or

123
00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.800
text each other. When we
got stuck on homework, having

124
00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:17.050
that community around me made
it much more bearable. Cause

125
00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:19.540
it is stressful. It's not
easy at all to go

126
00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:22.720
through boot camp. So it
just made it easier to

127
00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:28.510
learn and to commiserate and
everything. Now, when people go

128
00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:30.370
to college, we know that
like right now in the

129
00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:34.210
United States, like top tier private
universities are super expensive. Even

130
00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:36.520
a public university is going
to cost you many, many

131
00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:39.400
tens of thousands of dollars,
but a bootcamp isn't cheap

132
00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:42.310
either. Like people could spend
eight to 12 weeks and

133
00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:48.490
they could spend $10,000 for
this unaccredited, unknown, unregulated thing.

134
00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:51.220
Yeah. That's the scary thing
about it. And that's why

135
00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:56.350
you have to do your
research. I recommend talking to

136
00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:59.680
the teachers and just going
in and just seeing where

137
00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:03.420
the school takes place and
just meeting everyone who, who

138
00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:08.290
works there and also talking
to former students and seeing

139
00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:12.610
where they are today. Because
there, there are some scammy

140
00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:16.570
bootcamps. I can't say as
far as today, since you

141
00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:20.050
know, I've been out for
two years now, but you

142
00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:23.110
definitely need to, you know,
dig in and make sure

143
00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:26.980
it's, you know, it's actually
a company that wants to

144
00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:29.770
help you. You know? And
that's, that's why I loved

145
00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:33.850
my, my community so much.
They say that compared to

146
00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:36.160
self study that a bootcamp,
you know, it gives you

147
00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.740
that motivation. Like you said,
you have a community of

148
00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:42.640
people around you, but you're
effectively investing this $10,000 or

149
00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:45.820
some huge amount of money.
And I assume this isn't

150
00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:47.320
a 40 hour a week
thing. You don't just show

151
00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.080
up at nine and leave
at five. You're basically, you

152
00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:53.470
know, not sleeping for 10
weeks as you immerse yourself

153
00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:57.840
in the bootcamp, you needed
to try Not to not

154
00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:01.890
sleep. Cause I, I quickly
learned that getting three, four

155
00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:06.630
hours of sleep a night,
it, it definitely hurts you

156
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:09.990
to next day when you're
trying to, trying to follow

157
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:15.570
the teacher because they go
so freaking fast and it

158
00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:17.610
doesn't matter how many cups
of coffee you drink. If

159
00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:20.520
you don't have the rest
is going to be hard

160
00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:25.100
to follow and retain everything.
That's interesting because people are

161
00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:28.820
saying that boot camps could
be a way to get

162
00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:32.120
more women and more people
of color into, into the

163
00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:35.270
kind of the pipeline and
encourage people that maybe are

164
00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:38.120
high school, only a high
school educated person or older

165
00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.850
people or former teachers. Like
it's a way to get,

166
00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:44.990
they call nontraditional folks into
this. But now you're saying

167
00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:47.600
it goes really fast. Doesn't
that mean that people are

168
00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:50.900
gonna get left behind if
they can't keep up. It

169
00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:55.460
depends on the program and
how advanced it is, but

170
00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:58.160
you are completely right. It
does help people. One of

171
00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.980
my friends, my close friends
from boot camp only has

172
00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:04.310
a high school diploma. And
now he has an awesome

173
00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:08.360
jobs doing dev ops. Oh
wow. Okay. But did he,

174
00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.520
was he set up for
success in that he knew

175
00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:13.880
something already. Like I'm realizing
that my 10 and 12

176
00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:18.050
year old boys, my sons
are getting a 10 year

177
00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:21.590
head start because they have
iPads and they have laptops.

178
00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:25.130
Well, someone who maybe comes
in from a, you know,

179
00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:27.230
like a farming environment or
rural environment, they may not

180
00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:29.510
actually have got their first
computer until they're there. They're

181
00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:34.310
20. Is that 10 years
of, of being around computers,

182
00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:38.690
a I'm giving my kids
a leg up against someone

183
00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:43.070
else. That's a good point.
I, yeah, I think that

184
00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:45.560
could definitely have something to
do with it. Yeah. Were

185
00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:50.150
you always around computers growing
up? Yes. Yes. I, I

186
00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:53.330
remember being in middle school
and being one of the

187
00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:59.000
few people who actually used
AOL. Let's see. So you,

188
00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.670
as interesting. So you were
not only kind of, you're

189
00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:03.380
a digital native as they
like to say, right. You

190
00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:08.090
were online before everybody else
did. What do you think

191
00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:09.950
that, that made you go
into a bootcamp saying, Oh,

192
00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:12.110
well this is just something
I need to learn. Like

193
00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:15.410
it's knowable as opposed to
that sense that you get,

194
00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:17.240
you know, I'm sure you
have this when you're hanging

195
00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:20.180
out with nontechnical family members
at Christmas or it's like,

196
00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:22.880
Oh yeah. Kristen said techie,
you know, but that's not

197
00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:25.850
for me. I don't know
anything about first thing To

198
00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:28.640
me. I thought of it
as noble, but that's because,

199
00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:32.210
and grad school, I had
a, I think it was

200
00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:36.560
a project management class and
our teacher pretty much just

201
00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:39.470
had his teacher selves, how
to code, how to, how

202
00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:42.710
to use WordPress and go
in on the backend and

203
00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:45.680
to make some changes. So
I thought, well, I had

204
00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:48.290
to watch all of these
Linda videos. I can just

205
00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:53.950
go to codeacademy.com and to
make sure that even liked

206
00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:56.680
this stuff. And then when
I realized I did I

207
00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:58.870
enrolled in coding, boot camps,
like, Oh, well, I like

208
00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:02.790
it. And I can learn
myself. So why not? So

209
00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:05.550
it wasn't threatening, I guess
is what I'm saying. No,

210
00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:08.370
it wasn't threatening. Yeah. I
mean, not to say I

211
00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:12.870
wasn't nervous about the bootcamp.
Yeah. I'm trying to get

212
00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:16.710
a sense or to understand
like what separates people that

213
00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:19.110
want to like, and I've
talked about this before on

214
00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:21.360
the show who wants to
take apart the toaster when

215
00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.790
it's broken versus who's like,
and forget it. I'm just

216
00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:24.960
going to buy a new
toaster. I don't know why

217
00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:29.970
it doesn't work. That is
a good question there. I

218
00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:33.990
will say they were people
maybe let's see. No, there

219
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:37.380
was only one person who
dropped out of my, my

220
00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:40.800
cohort when I went through.
So it's definitely not for

221
00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:44.910
everybody. I think it's yeah.
Depending on people's expectations, I

222
00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:47.400
know some people just are
doing it for the money.

223
00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:49.140
I think they can just
learn it all in the

224
00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:51.420
bootcamp, but you're right. You
need to have some type

225
00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:54.930
of background or at least
study on your own before

226
00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:58.470
enrolling to ensure that, you
know, you have success in

227
00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:01.320
this. So you were on
AOL before you had a

228
00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:03.950
computer before she had, like,
it was in your life.

229
00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:07.680
You were familiar with computers,
but how far down the

230
00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:11.340
stack did you go? I
have a, a young woman

231
00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:13.080
on my team and I
was trying to teach her

232
00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:16.080
something low level because when
I grew up in the

233
00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:19.620
computer world, I learned like
assembler. And we would say,

234
00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:22.980
I went from the metal
up, like from the processor

235
00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:25.680
up. But she said, when
she learned, she went from

236
00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:29.070
like the screen or the
glass of the monitor back,

237
00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:31.950
they learned in like F
12 tools in Chrome. And

238
00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:35.070
JavaScript is the new metal.
When you're in a bootcamp.

239
00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:37.800
Are they talking about computer
science, tech techniques, like virtual

240
00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:40.470
memory and memory allocation, all
kind of stuff, or are

241
00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:43.440
they really talking about web
development and what, and is

242
00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:48.810
Chrome the computer During my
program, we focused on web

243
00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:53.940
development. We did a lot
of web apps. So we,

244
00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:56.490
we did, we did a
little bit of the foundation,

245
00:13:56.490 --> 00:14:00.660
HTML, CSS, and then foundational
JavaScript. And then we started

246
00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:05.820
focusing more on, on NBC
and making things with Ruby

247
00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:08.610
on rails. Do you, what
do you, what do you,

248
00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:10.620
what do you feel about
that? It's almost like when

249
00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:12.570
you learn to drive a
car, do you learn an

250
00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:15.180
automatic or do you learn
a stick shift Automatic? For

251
00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:19.290
sure. So that's really cool
though, because I think that's

252
00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:22.470
interesting. And that's, I think
teaching people who are maybe

253
00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:26.820
over 40, that, you know,
you don't need to know

254
00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:29.070
a stick shift to be
an effective driver. Do you

255
00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:30.990
like, you know what I
mean? Like, it's cool that

256
00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:32.850
you could, if you were
interested in that, but it's

257
00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:36.210
not required, we're just making
websites here. Do you think

258
00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:38.790
that there's a reason to
go any deeper or are

259
00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:41.760
people being elitist when they
say, well, you really need

260
00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:43.020
to learn how to drive
a stick shift if you're

261
00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:47.430
going to be an effective
driver. That's interesting. I, I,

262
00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:50.910
I honestly, I can't say,
but I always hear people

263
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:54.290
newbies say that they want
to learn how to build

264
00:14:54.290 --> 00:15:00.530
things from scratch. And I
just think, I just, I

265
00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:03.830
personally don't think it's necessary.
I mean, as someone who

266
00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:09.500
did freelance web design and
my current company, never has

267
00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:12.710
anyone done things from scratch
because it's just not efficient,

268
00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:16.430
you know, and see why
they think that because of

269
00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:22.790
trying to learn everything. But
what developer really knows everything

270
00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:25.790
like starting off, you know,
and the first couple years

271
00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:29.570
of learning, that's a good
point dying themselves up for

272
00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:34.000
disappointment. Yeah. And also, I
think as, as someone who

273
00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:36.640
myself, who wants to bring
more people into tech, if

274
00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:38.710
I'm trying to go and
shove 20 or 30 years

275
00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:42.430
of computer science into someone's
head in a month, that's

276
00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:46.060
just going to push them
away from tech entirely. Definitely.

277
00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:50.440
Yeah. So your focus is
on getting stuff done. And

278
00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:51.700
if w what do you
do then if you're at

279
00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:54.130
a bootcamp and you hit
some low level thing, like,

280
00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:56.980
you know, I mean, I'm
just brainstorming here, you know,

281
00:15:56.980 --> 00:16:00.850
an SSL certificate expires, or
there's a cookie that somehow

282
00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:04.150
being truncated by something, you
know, these are like, now

283
00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:06.250
you're into F 12 tools
and you're learning what's going

284
00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:09.670
on at the, at the
TCP and the HTTP level.

285
00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:12.070
Do they, is that just
like, well, ask somebody and

286
00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:15.460
get help, or do you
then dive into how, you

287
00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:20.230
know, let's talk about how
the internet itself works. Definitely

288
00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:24.220
in bootcamp, you asked someone
and which is really hard

289
00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:27.370
to do, because we all
don't want to admit that

290
00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:31.450
we can't solve something ourselves.
And so we ended up

291
00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:34.240
not be able to move
forward, because like I said,

292
00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:36.730
the program goes by so
quickly, you don't want to

293
00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:40.600
be stuck for two days
on something. So the idea

294
00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:43.570
that you're trying to figure
out what the right level

295
00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:47.230
to learn is, and what's
too low, what's too high.

296
00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:48.970
And then if you do
ask though, you're going to

297
00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:52.510
feel sad that, Oh, gosh,
if I have, I let

298
00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:54.340
out, have I let on
that? I don't belong here.

299
00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:58.150
Yeah. And everyone feels that
way when you're in boot

300
00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:00.730
camp, you think you're the
dumbest person in class, but,

301
00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:04.660
but everyone's just as lost.
Interesting. So it was not

302
00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:06.460
lonely. It was a, there
was a good community because

303
00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:09.520
we're all clueless together. Oh
my gosh. Yes. But in

304
00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:12.040
the, in the beginning, no
one, no one knows that.

305
00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:14.260
So you're sitting there on
day one, just looking around,

306
00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:18.880
going, what have I done?
That was me. And we

307
00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:22.540
had a, I think, I
think his title as community

308
00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:27.220
organizer, who would do check
ins with us every few

309
00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:31.420
weeks. And so we would
vent to him and let

310
00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:33.580
as to how we're doing.
And that's how I found

311
00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:36.880
out that I wasn't the
dumbest person in class. It's

312
00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:40.540
not that we're keeping score
to be clear, respect to

313
00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:45.550
the other people of varying
levels of dumbness. Yeah. I

314
00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:49.830
remember we had a meeting
and he said, Kristin, the

315
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:53.370
person I just met with
30 minutes ago literally said

316
00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:56.190
the same thing and feels
the same way you do

317
00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:01.650
right now. And so just
knowing that I wasn't alone

318
00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:04.140
and that kind of also
puts your guard down as

319
00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:07.590
well. And I think that
helps with the community feeling.

320
00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:10.850
It is really hard though,
to express that you don't

321
00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:13.940
know something. And then when
you're told that, well, you

322
00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:16.190
should be blogging and you
should maybe consider speaking at

323
00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:19.700
conferences. You should get your
name out there. That's asking

324
00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:22.640
a lot of anyone to
go and talk about doing

325
00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:25.400
something, because at any moment,
some random internet person could

326
00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:27.650
go and say, you have
no idea what you're talking

327
00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:30.020
about. And look, here's a
link to your blog where

328
00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:31.700
I know for a fact,
you have no idea what

329
00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:33.710
you're talking about. Look right
there, see what you wrote.

330
00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:38.120
That was dumb. I actually
get scared about that. About

331
00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:45.230
my YouTube channel sometimes. Yeah.
Yeah. Cause I mean, you

332
00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:48.650
hear so many different opinions
about things online and everyone

333
00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:54.020
has an opinion, so it's,
it's kind of hard it's

334
00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:58.640
yeah. Yeah. Literally before I
got on the call with

335
00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:02.480
you here, I went and
wrote a blog post. That's

336
00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:05.210
actually a followup to another
blog post. I wrote this

337
00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:08.720
blog post all about caching
and caching and web applications.

338
00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:12.530
And like the first comment
was like, this is a

339
00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:16.250
bad idea. You know, I
was like, Oh no, I'm

340
00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:17.900
reading this. I'm like, I'm
looking at this comment right

341
00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:19.730
now. It's like, you may
get away with it if

342
00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:22.370
you know, but in, you
know, basically it's like this

343
00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:25.640
works, but it's, it's working
because you're lucky and it's

344
00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:28.010
a bad practice and you
basically suck, you know, and

345
00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:29.510
he was super nice about
it, but I was just

346
00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:32.660
like, Oh, well, do I
delete the blog posts now?

347
00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:35.660
Or do I just, what
do I do? Like, how

348
00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:38.270
do I, where do I
emotionally put that information that

349
00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:41.000
this sucks. So it kind
of messed me up for

350
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.390
a day. And then I
ended up doing the research

351
00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:48.050
and I wrote a followup
blog post linked the first

352
00:19:48.050 --> 00:19:51.380
one to the followup and
then said, yeah, this is

353
00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:53.630
wrong. And here's why, and
I kind of like, it

354
00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:56.150
seems obvious in hindsight, but
this is good. And thank

355
00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:58.190
you so much for the
comment. You know, it wasn't

356
00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:00.440
a troll, it was like
a genuinely nice person trying

357
00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:04.040
to help out. But that
takes a lot of emotional

358
00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:07.490
fortitude to be able to
go through like the whole

359
00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:12.290
process there. Oh definitely. And
as I I've shared my

360
00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:16.190
coding journey and just getting
an attack journey on YouTube,

361
00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:20.420
that's definitely happened to me
a number of times. And

362
00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:24.200
I've learned that. I mean,
yeah, sometimes I am wrong,

363
00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:28.280
but also there are many
times when you can have

364
00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:34.760
the same result by doing
something different. Did, do you

365
00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:37.490
find YouTube to be a
friendly or not friendly environment?

366
00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:40.010
Like, are you, you, you
go and talk about going

367
00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:41.900
through a boot camp and
then do the trolls show

368
00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:46.130
up or are people pretty
positive? People have been pretty

369
00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:53.400
positive. I've I've gotten a
few marriage proposals. I have

370
00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:56.520
not. I wonder why you
have received marriage proposals and

371
00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:00.150
I have not. Do you
find that being a woman

372
00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:02.970
in tech is just half
marriage proposals and have people

373
00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:06.690
telling you that you're dumb?
No, no. I think there's

374
00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:10.920
a lot of people rooting
for me. And a lot

375
00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:15.510
of people who, who view
me as, you know, an

376
00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:17.730
example that look, she does
it so I can do

377
00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:21.450
it too, which is why
I kept going with my

378
00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:25.080
YouTube channel. That's good. It's,
it's important for all of

379
00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:27.690
us to do that. I
mean, even though I'm 18,

380
00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:30.570
20 years ahead of you
in my career, I, I

381
00:21:30.570 --> 00:21:33.180
hope when I write a
blog post where I say,

382
00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:36.030
yeah, I was totally wrong.
That was a mistake. And

383
00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:38.430
I'm cool about it and
pleasant about it. Makes it

384
00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:43.140
clear that it's about, it's
about the journey and it's

385
00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:46.320
not about some theoretical and
were like, yes. And now

386
00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:49.680
I know everything. Thank you.
I've made it. Yeah, That

387
00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:52.800
would, that would not be
very exciting. And you know,

388
00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:56.070
you kind of just reminded
me of this graph. I

389
00:21:56.070 --> 00:22:00.750
saw about, you know, when
you first start learning code

390
00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:03.450
and how you just, you
feel like you don't know

391
00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:06.960
anything. And then there's a
phase where you feel like

392
00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:09.450
a God, he know everything
and it's something else happens

393
00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:11.910
and it's just back and
forth. And it just keeps

394
00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:15.600
going. Like even after 20
years, that graph says, like,

395
00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:18.450
you still have that there's
moments where you don't feel

396
00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:21.600
like, you know, everything That
I love that you said

397
00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:23.850
that because you literally nailed
like my last three blog

398
00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:26.220
posts, like the first one,
I'm like, I'm learning all

399
00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:28.320
about caching and how to
do things correctly. And like,

400
00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:31.110
look at this code. It's
the most elegant 12 lines

401
00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:34.110
ever. And then, and then
of course the you're doing

402
00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:36.420
it entirely wrong comment and
happened. And then I was

403
00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:38.490
like, okay. And I learned,
I learned like, Oh my

404
00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:40.980
God, what was I thinking?
That was the worst 12

405
00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:43.800
lines. And then 12 became
three lines, you know? And

406
00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:44.820
now I'm thinking I might
be able to get it

407
00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:48.480
down to two, you know?
Yeah. And I, that's something

408
00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:51.570
we don't realize when you,
when you come into this

409
00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:56.100
industry that you're constantly learning
and you still have your

410
00:22:56.100 --> 00:23:00.390
bad days, Isn't it funny
how they tell you that,

411
00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:03.150
but you still don't really
internalize it. Like you don't

412
00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:06.990
really get like, Oh yeah.
You're always learning. No, you're

413
00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:09.540
really like really seriously. You're
always learning. Like, what do

414
00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:11.160
you, what's it going to
take? If you understand that

415
00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:14.550
you will be learning like
your degree. It means nothing.

416
00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:17.430
Like I went to school
in the late nineties. It

417
00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:23.100
means nothing. It's all changed.
The whole Internet's different. Hey

418
00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:24.930
friends, this is Scott. I
want you to know how

419
00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:27.360
much I appreciate you as
listeners. And I hope you

420
00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:31.800
appreciate my sponsors because they
make the show possible. Raygun

421
00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:35.370
provides full stack error, crash,
and performance monitoring for tech

422
00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:38.490
teams, whether you're a software
engineer looking to diagnose and

423
00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:41.640
resolve issues with greater speed
and accuracy or a product

424
00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:44.250
manager drowning in bug reports,
or maybe you're just concerned.

425
00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:48.380
You're losing customers to poor
quality online experiences. Raygun can

426
00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:51.320
provide you with the answers,
get full stack error and

427
00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:54.590
performance monitoring in one place.
The next time you're struggling

428
00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:57.200
to replicate errors and performance
issues and your code base

429
00:23:57.260 --> 00:24:01.310
think Raygun head over to
raygun.com. That's R a Y

430
00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:04.640
G U n.com and get
up and running within minutes

431
00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:08.200
and dramatically improve your online
experiences of your users. That

432
00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:10.840
kind of reminds me of
imposter syndrome as well. Cause

433
00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:13.960
I had many people warn
me that once I start

434
00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:16.630
working full time, I'm going
to get imposter syndrome after

435
00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:21.850
boot camp. And it wasn't
until I was venting to

436
00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:25.150
a more senior friend who,
when he pointed out that

437
00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:27.700
that was imposter syndrome, I
was like, this is ed.

438
00:24:27.910 --> 00:24:31.300
This feeling depressed and being
afraid of my boss is

439
00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:36.400
going to fire me Well.
And, and that brings up

440
00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:39.370
these issues of privilege that
I've talked about before on

441
00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:43.060
the show, which is, who
has the ability to have

442
00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:47.320
imposter syndrome publicly and who
just sneaks home and notices?

443
00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:49.300
No one, like maybe no
one will notice that I'm

444
00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:52.720
an imposter. And definitely as
someone who's older and had

445
00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:55.150
been in tech, I can
go in a con in

446
00:24:55.150 --> 00:24:57.760
a, in a, in a
meeting and I can say,

447
00:24:57.790 --> 00:25:01.870
what does that acronym mean?
And people probably won't flip

448
00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:04.930
the bozo bit on me
and go, Oh man, Hanselman.

449
00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:07.300
He has no idea what
he's talking about, but if

450
00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:09.520
you've only been at the
company two weeks and you're

451
00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:12.220
like, what does this mean?
Maybe people will be like,

452
00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:18.100
wow. Christian should know that.
Yeah. I've definitely felt that.

453
00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:22.780
So how instrumental was having
done this code camp to

454
00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:25.750
getting your job? Like, did
you have, is there any

455
00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:30.370
stigma attached to having bootcamp
on, on your resume? I

456
00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:35.110
did not experience that or
at least I identity since

457
00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:40.420
any stigmatism for that coding
boot camp definitely is the

458
00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:44.950
reason why I got my
amazing job. Trying to go

459
00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:47.590
back to think about stigmas,
but no, I can't think

460
00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:50.470
of any. Do you think,
did you, let me ask

461
00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:53.140
you this, did your tech
resume that the resume, you

462
00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:56.380
hand it around say master's
degree on it. And do

463
00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:59.710
you think that people cared
like, Oh wow. Master suite?

464
00:25:59.710 --> 00:26:00.970
Cause I always like, I
didn't, I don't have a

465
00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:04.720
master's degree, so I'm always
like, Ooh, graduate school. When

466
00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:07.510
I see a resume that
has graduate school on No,

467
00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:13.450
actually I got more, I
got a bigger response about

468
00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:17.680
doing freelance web design after
boot camp. Not many people

469
00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:21.460
acknowledge my master's degree. Interesting.
Is it at the bottom

470
00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:25.030
of the resume or is
on page two? I think

471
00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:27.550
it's at the bottom. I've
rearranged it recently right now.

472
00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:29.170
It's at the bottom. So
I mean, that could be

473
00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:32.830
it, but my bootcamps at
the bottom as well. Yeah.

474
00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:35.200
Our bootcamps given a grade.
Do you have any idea

475
00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:36.730
who came out at the
top of the class or

476
00:26:36.730 --> 00:26:38.800
who really did well or
is it about the portfolio

477
00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:41.350
that you're building while you're
doing the bootcamp? It's definitely

478
00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:47.400
portfolio portfolio driven. We didn't
grade anything. Honestly, we would,

479
00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:52.620
we would come back to
class with our assignment and

480
00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:57.780
go over them and, you
know, discuss any problems everyone

481
00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:00.480
had with it. But no,
we didn't grade and it

482
00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:05.000
wasn't certificate either. You have
a video that I'll link

483
00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.890
to in the show notes.
And that's again, how I

484
00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:08.780
found you, which is, you
know, how to get a

485
00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:11.000
job after it, after a
boot camp and how it

486
00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.210
went. And you basically call
out three things that you

487
00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:16.820
think people need to focus
on when they are coming

488
00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:19.160
out of a bootcamp to
get a job. Oh yeah,

489
00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:24.620
definitely. So, especially in my
experience and about everyone in

490
00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:30.260
my cohort, my cohort was
about 12 people. We landed

491
00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:35.210
jobs through networking. Oh my
gosh. And speaking of which

492
00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:39.170
one of my friends has
now accepted her second job

493
00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:42.800
after bootcamp at Microsoft. And
she made that connection and

494
00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:46.370
a meetup group Really interesting.
All right. Well I will

495
00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:50.930
have to say hi. Yeah.
So I always talk highly

496
00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:56.360
of meetup groups and just
not just being upfront and

497
00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:59.870
saying, Oh, I just got
a bootcamp. I'm looking for

498
00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:03.200
a job. Are you hiring?
But just, just getting to

499
00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:06.590
know that person and what
they do and yeah. Just

500
00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:09.770
getting to know them and
maybe viewing them as more

501
00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:12.650
of a mentor in the
future, not showed up saying

502
00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:17.060
we'd be my mentor, but
just staying connected, adding them

503
00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:20.450
on LinkedIn and following up
a week or two later.

504
00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:23.870
Yeah. What is that quote?
That luck is what happens

505
00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:28.010
when preparation meets opportunity. It
seems like meetups are really

506
00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:30.740
an opportunity for you to
make opportunity. Like you, you

507
00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:33.110
show up and if you
go to beat, you know,

508
00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:35.120
two or three, if you
can, if you can go

509
00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:37.970
to a couple of meetups
a week and be visible,

510
00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:40.070
people will start saying, Oh,
there's a new person in

511
00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:43.580
the community. I liked that.
You said be visible because

512
00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:45.500
going to a meet up,
not talking to someone and

513
00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:49.970
going home, that's not going
to benefit you at all.

514
00:28:49.970 --> 00:28:53.690
You need to at least
raise your hand, ask a

515
00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:57.350
question or two. Or if
you don't like the idea

516
00:28:57.350 --> 00:29:01.640
of so many people seeing
or hearing you speak, go

517
00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:05.480
up to the speaker afterwards
and introduce yourself and just

518
00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:08.480
say you liked their presentation.
You know, that's, that's a

519
00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:11.960
great start. <inaudible> so it
sounds like, like, did they

520
00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:14.210
teach you to go to
meetups? Like does the boot

521
00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:16.250
camp say, okay, good job,
good job. See ya. And

522
00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:18.140
then they kick you out
the door or do you

523
00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:19.820
do they say all right
now it's time to learn

524
00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:22.280
about how to network and
how to be confident and

525
00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:23.930
how to shake hands and
look people in the eye.

526
00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:28.370
They did recommend meetups a
lot, but no one really

527
00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:35.660
explained networking and how to
do it properly. And that

528
00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:37.940
is something I wish they
would touch on more as

529
00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:44.010
to confidence because that's probably
the thing after bootcamp. Yeah.

530
00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:47.610
Being a techie, being a
coder is really more about

531
00:29:47.610 --> 00:29:50.700
communication than anyone ever realized.
Like, you can be by

532
00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:53.880
yourself, you can get the
job in via email. You

533
00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:56.160
can do the job and
then send them the code

534
00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:59.940
via email, but being an
effective team member, you know,

535
00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:02.550
being a is about networking.
It's about being good in

536
00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:05.040
your group. It's about white
boarding. It's about explaining yourself

537
00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:09.960
about advocating for yourself. It's
hard. Definitely. So let me

538
00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:11.520
ask you this. As we,
as we get towards the

539
00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:14.280
end here, like where do
you see techie ending and

540
00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:19.500
coder or programmer starting and
on that gradient, as we

541
00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:21.900
were talking about, when do
you, when do you say

542
00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:23.580
all right, you know, I
could actually write an app.

543
00:30:23.610 --> 00:30:25.770
I'm I'm, I'm a coder
now. Like I'm, I'm a

544
00:30:25.770 --> 00:30:29.520
member of the community. So
you're asking when someone can

545
00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:32.070
say whether or not they're
a coder versus being a

546
00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:35.250
techie. Yeah. Or, or is
that even an inappropriate a

547
00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:39.000
label? I don't know. Okay.
First I was thinking, you

548
00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.490
could call yourself a coder
when you're doing it professionally,

549
00:30:41.490 --> 00:30:45.330
but I know so many
great developers who do it

550
00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:48.600
in their free time for
fun, That are not doing

551
00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:52.920
it in their jobs. Like
for, for my Correct. They're

552
00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:56.310
doing their jobs. That's a
good question because no one

553
00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:57.840
says like, no one has
said that this is a

554
00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:01.500
requirement that you have to
get paid. If you did

555
00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:03.780
your church's website or you
did your kid's little league.

556
00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:09.090
<inaudible> definitely. And then I
also wonder about skill level

557
00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:12.060
too. Cause when I hear
a techie, I'm not really

558
00:31:12.810 --> 00:31:15.390
like, that could be beginner.
That could, I don't know.

559
00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:18.090
That could be anything. Well,
this gets down to like,

560
00:31:18.090 --> 00:31:21.600
what do we tell our
family members at Thanksgiving? You

561
00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:23.850
know, I just say like,
computer person seems to be

562
00:31:23.850 --> 00:31:26.850
like the generic. I'm not
going to fix your computer,

563
00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:28.650
but yes, I know how
to, if I needed to.

564
00:31:29.970 --> 00:31:31.740
And ultimately I'm going to
end up fixing your computer.

565
00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:37.860
Anyway. The funny thing is,
even though I know some

566
00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:42.990
front end and WordPress and
now UX people ask me

567
00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:48.030
questions about servers and other
things that go way over

568
00:31:48.030 --> 00:31:51.990
my head. I'm like, okay,
just because I can design

569
00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:55.350
a website doesn't mean I
know what to do when

570
00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:59.370
the wifi isn't. Yeah. Well,
but fortunately you do know

571
00:31:59.370 --> 00:32:00.990
how to learn now and
you know how to learn

572
00:32:00.990 --> 00:32:03.660
texts. So if you chose
to be a server person,

573
00:32:03.690 --> 00:32:07.050
you know what to do,
that is true. Very cool.

574
00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:10.020
Well, thanks so much for
chatting with me today. Yeah.

575
00:32:10.050 --> 00:32:12.330
Thanks for having me. This
was fun. Make sure that

576
00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:13.800
you check out the show
notes. I'm going to have

577
00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:18.450
links to Kristen's a YouTube
channel and the coding boot

578
00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:21.330
camp video that got me
in touch with her. This

579
00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:23.790
has been another episode of
Hansel minutes and we'll see

580
00:32:23.790 --> 00:32:24.660
you again next week.
