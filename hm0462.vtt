During the month of March,
we here at Hanselman it's

9
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.800
are teaming up with code
newbie to learn all about

10
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.040
making stuff with hardware. Be
sure to check marches for

code newbie podcast. <inaudible> From

12
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.590
hanselminutes.com. It's Hansel minutes, a
weekly discussion with web developer

13
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.330
and technologist Scott Hanselman. This
is Lawrence Ryan announcing show number

14
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.110
four 65. In this episode,
Scott talks three D printing

15
00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:21.320
with printer bots, Brooke drum.
<inaudible>. Hi, this is Scott

16
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.900
Hanselman. This is another episode
of Hansel minutes and on

17
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.270
the phone right now. I've
got Brooke drum from printer

18
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.850
bot. Thank you very much.
Nice to meet you, sir.

19
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.100
Great to talk to you,
Scott. Thanks for having me

20
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.680
on, I am a, I
want to make sure that

21
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.230
people understand that I don't
have any affiliation with printer

22
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.500
bot. Although I have been
shamelessly promoting my three D

23
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.710
printer from, I have a
simple metal plus I think

24
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.080
people might think that's a
little suspicious that suddenly you're

25
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.300
on the show now, as
I've been gushing about your

26
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.540
product now for some weeks,
well, dude, I'm glad to

27
00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.790
talk to you because I'm
so thankful for the stuff

28
00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.630
that you've written and primarily,
because it's so honest, sometimes

29
00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.960
a little brutally honest, but
I love that. And I

30
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.000
that's the type of people
I want to talk about

31
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.240
my products, the people that
tell the truth. Yeah. I

32
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.400
wanted a three D printer.
I knew it was. I

33
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.470
knew that it was something
I wanted in my house.

34
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.590
I do admit though that
I thought somehow it would

35
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.470
be like a star Trek
replicator, and I would just

36
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.590
say T Earl grey hot
and it would just pop

37
00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.440
out. And it's kind of
like that once you get

38
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.830
it dialed in, but it's
also kind of, not, first

39
00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.990
of all, I love this
star Trek reference and I

40
00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.450
love talking to people that
know what that is. My

41
00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.400
kids, I make that joke.
They don't even know what

42
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.060
I'm talking about, but yeah,
it is definitely not a

43
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.770
replicator. And I love that
Mike or that MakerBot actually,

44
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.500
I think they patented that
name cause I was like,

45
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.140
man, that's trouble now. You're
just making like a direct

46
00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.760
line between, you know, that
science fiction and this reality.

47
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.550
And there's such a, such
a gap in between the

48
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.940
reality of the two at
the same time though, the

49
00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.280
level of enthusiasm that you
see out of the, kind

50
00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.930
of the general, when they
see these things. I, we

51
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.510
had a bunch of people
over for dinner recently, and

52
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.850
I don't know how your,
how your home situation is

53
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.340
set up, but basically I'm
not allowed to bring people

54
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.970
into my office when people
are visiting because they never,

55
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.430
they never come out. You
know what I mean? They

56
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.330
see the RK, they see
I'm at the office. So

57
00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.820
my office is literally my
printer. I'm looking over at

58
00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.520
my kitchen table in the
one great room we have

59
00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.160
in our little 1300 square
foot house. And my printer

60
00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.560
is on the table and
there's no room to even

61
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.590
sit down. So That's the,
that's the sign of a

62
00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.710
true maker when the entire
house is the mine? Just

63
00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:36.660
my office, I guess when
we go to the garage.

64
00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.990
Yeah, they, they lose me.
Yeah. Yeah. So I we're

65
00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:41.940
sitting there and we're, we're,
you know, we're having our

66
00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.770
meal and I desperately want
to tell people about my

67
00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.710
three D printer, but I
say nothing. And then someone

68
00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.710
mentioned seeing a three D
printer on TV. And then

69
00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.990
my wife looks at me
with her rolling eyes and

70
00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.170
I go, you know, I
have a three D printer.

71
00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.690
And the best part was
one of the ladies who

72
00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.870
was over, she stood up
like, you can imagine this.

73
00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.440
She stood up. She pushed,
you know, the, the, the,

74
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.420
the, the, the speed of
her raising up and the

75
00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.080
back of her knees shove,
shove the chair back. And

76
00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.330
she said, you have a
three D printer. And we've

77
00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.490
been sitting here for two
hours, not looking at it.

78
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.120
And then my wife says,
my wife says, all right,

79
00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.450
go ahead. There's a certain
kind of magic. I mean,

80
00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.240
it's magic, but it's a
certain kind of magic. It's

81
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.190
like, you can't just, you
know, say the magic. You

82
00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:30.930
know, I'm thinking like my
kids are in a Harry Potter,

83
00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.050
just an incantation and it
work. But if you learn

84
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.630
the dark arts of three
D printing, you can make

85
00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.420
this thing, do amazing things,
but it takes time to,

86
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.990
there's a learning curve. It
takes time. There are problems

87
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.270
that I kind of like
to say that there's always

88
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.840
going to be challenges, but
I think those challenges will

89
00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.680
be reduced in the future.
Maybe we can all buy

90
00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:57.480
material or plastic that isn't
crap, or maybe the software

91
00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.600
tool chain will, will be
easier. But right now there's

92
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.900
some really hard parts that
can be off putting I'm

93
00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.790
sure your demo was great
though. What did you do?

94
00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.660
So I, it was getting
close to, you know, it's

95
00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.860
getting close to a Valentine's
day. So we made a

96
00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.130
3d pendant because it's, you
know, it's small. It can

97
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.190
be put on a necklace,
but it also it's precise

98
00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.700
enough that the little kind
of 3d heart has a,

99
00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.630
a loop on the top
and it also has supports.

100
00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.790
So that's like my go
to first, instead of doing

101
00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:29.160
a first cube, I do
this little 15 minute pendant

102
00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.670
and it shows, supports, it
shows a little raft. You

103
00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:34.590
know, the raft is the
thing that keeps it from

104
00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.090
tipping over. And then everyone
gets one, right? So you

105
00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.260
go into the application, you
say, I want 15 of

106
00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.330
these. And then you have,
you have dinner. And then

107
00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.940
everyone walks out with a
pendant. Oh, that's great. Wow.

108
00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.150
I'm like a walking advertisement
for these houses. How long

109
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.840
have you been doing this?
I got my gosh, I'd

110
00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.460
have to look at my
blog post. I think it's

111
00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.830
been 18 days. That is
shocking. And so people have

112
00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.690
to understand now I'm going
to be, do a little

113
00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:05.990
reality here. You're not normal
people that have these things

114
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.660
for two weeks or three
weeks. They don't get, as

115
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:12.050
far as you've gotten now.
Surely you recognize that about

116
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:16.030
yourself, right? No, that's, that's,
I mean, that's very kind

117
00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:18.820
and weird that you say
that because I'm reading the

118
00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.070
forums. And honestly, I have
to say I'm finding the

119
00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:23.530
community to be very kind
and very welcoming, but they're

120
00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:26.380
talking about things like it's
like when you learn, you

121
00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:28.390
know, Linux for the first
time, and then suddenly someone

122
00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:30.760
starts saying, OCHIN said, and
you're like, Whoa. Yeah, there's

123
00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:35.500
a vernacular that becomes, You're
talking about like extrusion. Like

124
00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.860
you told me that my
retraction was dialed in and

125
00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:40.870
it took me like learning
a new language. I was

126
00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.270
like, like ordering in Spanish
at Chipotle. And I'm like,

127
00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:48.160
Oh, okay. Yeah, There is
a vernacular. And I, that

128
00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:52.090
is something that I completely
forget for newbies. They do

129
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:53.950
at shows and stuff. When
people see it for the

130
00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:56.350
first time, and I'm, I'm
saying stuff like extrusion or

131
00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:00.250
even stuff like hot end
and what, that, that, that

132
00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:02.860
is something I take for
granted, but you're not normal

133
00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.050
in, in the fact that
like I was reading your

134
00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:08.500
first blog post that I
really loved and people have

135
00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.350
to read it. It talks
through, was it 16 hours

136
00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:14.860
and 16 emotions? It was
like 16 levels of hell.

137
00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:18.070
I like to call it.
But you were frustrated at

138
00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:21.220
the beginning. And the point
at which you kind of

139
00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.720
are one of the points
where it was kind of

140
00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:26.920
a pivotal point in the
blog post was when you

141
00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:31.210
said you discovered open JS
cat or a JS Catterson.

142
00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:33.550
And I was like, okay,
this guy is normal. He's

143
00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:36.640
some kind of programmer guy.
And now, and now he

144
00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.800
just took the fork in
the road that it's like,

145
00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:41.680
okay. So those, cause I'm
not a programmer. I would

146
00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.690
love to know how to
use that. I've opened up.

147
00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:45.610
I don't know how many
plane rides I've tried to

148
00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:48.340
open up open S CAD,
which again, here we are

149
00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:51.670
in the vernacular, it's a
programmatical way to design things.

150
00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:55.420
If you're not a programmer,
it's complete Greek. And it

151
00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:58.690
does make some sense with
like math and if you're

152
00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:03.280
logical, but I have never
successfully made one thing in

153
00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.830
openness CAD or open jazz
CAD or whatever. But that's

154
00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:07.750
when I knew you were
different. So that's how you're

155
00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:12.010
different. Your brain works a
different way. Maybe that is

156
00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:15.580
possible. I do think that
there's definitely some, some benefit

157
00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:17.530
for that. But the reason
that I ended up using

158
00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.780
open S CAD was that
I, I went down to

159
00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:22.330
Fry's electronics and I said,
you know, I need some

160
00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:24.820
filament. And then, but this
is here. There's a good

161
00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:27.460
contrast between what you're saying,
where I'm different or I've

162
00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:30.490
got some abilities, but I
also went down, bought some

163
00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:34.420
filament off the, off the
shelf. Okay. In ignorance. I

164
00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:35.980
just said, I need some
filament. And then the kid

165
00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:39.910
goes, here's some. And I
go home. No abs. Well,

166
00:08:39.910 --> 00:08:41.650
it actually, so that could
have been that it wasn't.

167
00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:46.120
Gosh, I didn't know. I
was just wondering if you

168
00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.860
made a mistake, Didn't even
check that, like, see, this

169
00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:49.580
is the thing, right? Like
I may have the, the

170
00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.060
JavaScript side, but I'm like,
you're literally like, I don't

171
00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:53.890
even know what that is.
Yes. I hope not. But

172
00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:56.010
the, I get the, and
I'm ready to plug it

173
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:58.560
in and I go, wait
a second. The spool hole

174
00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.410
is different. The size of
the spool hole is different.

175
00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:03.930
I'm like, Oh crap. You
know? So the, you know,

176
00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:06.480
these are these, these filament
things, they look like big,

177
00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:08.820
giant rolls of spaghetti. And
then the hole in the

178
00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:10.560
middle is like the, the,
the, the, the whole way

179
00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:13.200
your actual goes and you
stick it on top. So

180
00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:16.620
I went to this open
JS CAD because I needed

181
00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:20.520
basically, you know, a cylinder
with a hole in it.

182
00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:22.680
All I wanted was to
make a donut. And I

183
00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:25.650
fought with all these three
D CAD programs that you

184
00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:28.920
probably use without any problem
at all. I couldn't make

185
00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:31.290
this thing in Tinkercad, which
is the one that children

186
00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:34.110
use. And then I went
to open JS cat, and

187
00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:36.690
I did it in four
lines of code, because you're

188
00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:39.660
just saying, I want a
cylinder. That's 40, 40 millimeters

189
00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:43.800
tall with a radius of
26 millimeters. That's so clear.

190
00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:47.780
Like, I think it's 12
actual keystrokes it's. So It's

191
00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:51.350
funny because there is nuances.
And even it's funny, it

192
00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:55.370
shows my age, but like
I design on, on this

193
00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:57.410
Mac here and it has
a touch pad and there's

194
00:09:57.410 --> 00:10:01.520
all these gestures and stuff.
And my engineer, he grew

195
00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:04.970
up with inventor for, you
know, 15 years or something.

196
00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:07.490
And so he can only
use a mouse and it's

197
00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:13.190
a windows thing. So just
the software is so challenging,

198
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:16.730
even when it comes down
to selecting things and all

199
00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:22.580
this gesture control there, there's
no standard interface for, you

200
00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:24.710
know, you're trying to move
something around in three D

201
00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:27.350
on a two D screen.
It's just really challenging. So

202
00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:30.170
the software has a long
way to go before. It's

203
00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:33.650
truly intuitive. Now I will
say that my son, who's

204
00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:39.380
10. He uses, you know,
he plays Xbox games and

205
00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:41.210
he has grown up in
kind of a three D

206
00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:45.530
environment as far as like
games and just even touch

207
00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:48.620
environment. So when he, like,
he sat down with me

208
00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:50.810
last night and we were
doing a little, we've got

209
00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:53.750
a new LCD panel coming
out to control the printer.

210
00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:57.170
And we were designing a
little box. He just instinctively

211
00:10:57.170 --> 00:11:00.860
understands what I'm doing. I
use SketchUp a lot. Cause

212
00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:04.130
I teach a lot of
kids how to draw stuff

213
00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:08.840
in three D. And some
of those programs like say

214
00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:15.020
inventor or better example would
be Autodesk fusion, three 60,

215
00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:19.160
which is free for makers,
very complicated interface. There's like

216
00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.110
a whole class you need
to take on just the

217
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:24.400
tree of like the history
of what you're doing. And

218
00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:27.770
all that SketchUp is just
like, draw a square. Like

219
00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.950
your cylinder and SketchUp would
be draw a circle and

220
00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:33.470
then grab the top of
it with this extrusion tool

221
00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:36.530
and just pull up and
you're done. So he gets

222
00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:40.550
that. But my old brain
thinking about all the way

223
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:43.130
back to like, you know,
you did things in command

224
00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:47.240
line, it's new. We, we,
we definitely, we go with

225
00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.580
the tool that we want
to, but what's nice is

226
00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:53.290
that I found out finally,
like it clicks, there's so

227
00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:54.970
many clicks. This is the
thing with the three D

228
00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:58.400
printing. Like you, you reach
a new plateau. Right? What,

229
00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:00.550
I mean, I spent three,
you know, three, four hours

230
00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:03.100
trying to get the Z
axis, dialed in to make

231
00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:05.710
it, so it didn't keep
hitting the tip. But then

232
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:07.930
once I did that, I'm
like, okay, you know, I

233
00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:09.700
don't want to do it
again. But if I have

234
00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:12.250
to, I got that skill
now. He's like, you know,

235
00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:14.850
it's like learning to drive
stick. Yeah. It's funny on

236
00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:17.310
customer support. I sit next
to a we're all in

237
00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:20.550
like one office. And I
sit next to the customer

238
00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:23.970
support guy. And when he
like over, I think I

239
00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:28.180
mentioned in black Friday, we
had unbelievable sales. Like it

240
00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:31.710
was ridiculous. And so we
had so many new users

241
00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:34.170
looking to buy a three
D printer for the first

242
00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:38.340
time. And so when we
started shipping those bots immediately,

243
00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:41.370
you get this barrage of
questions. And they're all like,

244
00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:44.640
if they just would have
read anything that we wrote,

245
00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:47.040
like documentation and stuff, they
would know these answers. But

246
00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:51.270
a lot of times I
say, listen, you, you want

247
00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:54.180
to concentrate on the guys
that are dying a horrible

248
00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:56.550
death right now. And that
we know there's a problem,

249
00:12:56.970 --> 00:13:00.420
but give those guys a
day that are asking these

250
00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:02.430
simple questions. Cause they're not
only going to figure it

251
00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:06.030
out, but they're going to
realize, Oh, I can figure

252
00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:09.030
things out. There is this
learning curve that even though

253
00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:12.000
there was pain involved in
like your blog post, you

254
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.330
could see the progression of
you pushed through some of

255
00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:19.140
the essential learnings and then
it, then you started calling

256
00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:22.230
it like, well, you, you
described yourself later, like you

257
00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:24.750
were pro. And I'm like,
yeah, it doesn't take that

258
00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:28.980
long to like squirt hot
plastic. And you're just building

259
00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:32.670
on that in a little
more structure. That is actually

260
00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:34.530
true. You know? And I
liked that. You said that

261
00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:36.450
you, you, you're doing a
lot of teaching of children.

262
00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:40.170
So now, now that I
am the, the advanced expert

263
00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:41.550
that I am, and I
say that with all, you

264
00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:44.790
know, tongue in cheek, I'm
the expert within about three

265
00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:47.580
miles of my house. Right.
Which means I've got this

266
00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:50.580
neighborhood locked down. So I
decided to go to the,

267
00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:52.920
my kids community school and
I say, Hey, you know,

268
00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:55.200
I know everything about three
D printing. I want to

269
00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:56.820
do a little talk. So
I give a little talk

270
00:13:56.820 --> 00:14:00.480
at the kids' school, all
the kids immediately got it.

271
00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:02.490
And the way to explain
it to them was to

272
00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:05.130
go and Google do Google
images. And I searched for

273
00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:07.770
three D printed chocolate. And
then they were like, they

274
00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:09.960
were like, Oh, okay, cool.
It's just like, you know,

275
00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:11.880
it's like, when you squeeze
a happy birthday on a

276
00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:14.730
cake, right. Except with hot
plastic. And they're like, fine,

277
00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:16.680
I totally get it. I,
and then I was starting

278
00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:19.830
to explain how supports work,
right. This idea of overhang.

279
00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:22.560
And I've got eight year
olds going, Oh, because it

280
00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:25.650
would fall over. Otherwise I'm
like, yes. Then this is

281
00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:28.410
Minecraft. They know, they know
you've got to have a

282
00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:30.660
little support there. Otherwise the
bricks not going to stick.

283
00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:35.970
It's amazing. Great. I always
use the for adults. The

284
00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:40.110
example I use is I
like the cake frosting thing

285
00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:42.330
because, you know, there's, there's
people that have done that,

286
00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:46.050
but also just a hot
glue gun. So it's a

287
00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:48.330
hot, it's like a hot
glue gun on a robot

288
00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:50.850
arm. Ooh. I like that.
I'm going to use that.

289
00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:53.720
Yeah, because we've all Done
that. Or we've squeezed out

290
00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:58.220
toothpaste or we extrude stuff
constantly. I mean, every day,

291
00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:00.620
you know, I, I brushed
my teeth morning and night

292
00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:04.690
and it's the same thing,
You know, it's interesting because

293
00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:07.870
the word extrude immediately makes
you think computer person like,

294
00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:10.930
Oh, this is a technical
term, but you're right. Toothpaste,

295
00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:16.660
guns, gunk catch up right
on their name and catch

296
00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:19.870
up itself. So why, why
maybe it's just the word

297
00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:22.810
extrude. That's too complicated for
people to get. We pee

298
00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:29.800
in the snow. It's just
like my son would get

299
00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:35.110
that. Believe me, Hey, this
is Scott. You know, I

300
00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:38.080
like a good community edition.

magazine right now, I'm looking

307
00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:07.240
at it's make magazine and
it has 26, three D

308
00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:09.340
printers tested. So I, I
go and buy this at

309
00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:11.740
the, at the radio shack
fire sale, which I'm very

310
00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:14.890
sad about. But yeah, I
got it for 90% off

311
00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:17.710
though. And it's it's page
after page of three D

312
00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:20.860
printers. So I am just
geeking out and here we

313
00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:24.730
go, look at that printer
bought simple metal best value

314
00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:28.150
returns with serious upgrades. Here's
the thing though, I'm looking

315
00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:30.580
through this and it's 26
different printers and this is

316
00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:36.250
over, I'm oversimplifying it, but
it's basically 25, $2,000 printers.

317
00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:39.850
This is basically what it
is. Right. And then the

318
00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:44.950
simple metal for five 99
and that's assembled. Right. And

319
00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:48.340
you basically came in like
second out of 26 printers,

320
00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:51.940
but I didn't feel like
that was really expressed in

321
00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:53.860
the magazine. Like they should
have been like, Holy crap,

322
00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:57.310
twenty-five printers and the one
you should bought. I think

323
00:16:57.310 --> 00:17:00.790
they were so focused on
results. And I really, you

324
00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:03.460
know, what would be fascinating
for you is get the

325
00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:07.450
other two issues that they
did on the two, it's

326
00:17:07.450 --> 00:17:10.240
an annual issue that they've
done for three years. You

327
00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:12.310
have to go back and
I think might even have

328
00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:16.630
him on ebook or something
or download. It is fascinating

329
00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:19.000
where they started. It was
like a hot mess of

330
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.510
printers and half the companies
don't even exist anymore. And

331
00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:25.130
I remember dropping off, I
went with my wife, we

332
00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:29.140
drove over to make an,
I forget what they are,

333
00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:34.810
but Sebastopol and they've moved
now, but we dropped off

334
00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:36.250
the printer. I mean, went
like we had it in

335
00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:38.920
our trunk. We dropped off
the printer and I put

336
00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:40.930
it on the table and
there's all these other printers.

337
00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:44.440
And there's like 30 printers.
And I hadn't seen, I

338
00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:47.140
don't think, but five of
them or something, it was

339
00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:51.390
just this wild. So history
of the, the consumer three

340
00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:53.100
D printing is kind of
fascinating. If you look back

341
00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:55.830
on the old issues. Well,
over the years, the three

342
00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:58.140
years that they've done it,
they realized that they really

343
00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:02.910
needed to focus in on
a very fair side by

344
00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:06.990
side comparison. So in this
particular issue, they even made

345
00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:10.050
special models. And the guy
that, that did it, I

346
00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:13.290
don't know if I've met
him, but he's fantastic how

347
00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:16.800
his approach to get the
best side by side comparison

348
00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:22.080
results. I mean the same
filament, these models were specifically

349
00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:26.490
designed to highlight perhaps one
particular aspect of three D

350
00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:29.100
printing. And they did a
series of them. It's very

351
00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:32.040
thorough, but I do agree
with you that it goes

352
00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:36.300
in. So kind of in
depth to the side by

353
00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:40.350
side comparison of how the
printer actually prints. When really

354
00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:43.500
I have always said from
the beginning, from even the

355
00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:46.530
Kickstarter, the whole reason I'm
in the game is I

356
00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:49.890
couldn't afford a three D
printer. And I had to

357
00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:53.820
save up for literally, it
was literally six months cause

358
00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:55.890
I was a web developer
at the time and making

359
00:18:55.920 --> 00:19:00.390
zero money. So I birthday
Christmas, I think I ended

360
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:01.710
up putting part of it
on the credit card. And

361
00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:05.430
I didn't tell my wife
that I bought a MakerBot

362
00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:11.010
cupcake that was $700, normally
$1,200. And I thought, if

363
00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:14.100
this is the price for
three D printing, it's never

364
00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:16.470
going to take off. So
I have always said, the

365
00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:20.220
first barrier to entry is
price for the average consumer.

366
00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:24.180
So that is my focus.
But at the same time,

367
00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:28.770
I've built $500 printers that
the Kickstarter printer was, there

368
00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:30.960
was a portions of it
that were kind of crappy

369
00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:33.390
over the three years that
I've been in business. I've

370
00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:38.910
realized you can't sacrifice quality
for the price that you

371
00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:42.510
offer. So we've really got
two priorities now printer, but

372
00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:46.650
not just low price, but
quality. So I think we

373
00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:49.400
stand out on both. Yeah.
The thing that is so

374
00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:52.100
impressive in this one, as
opposed to the there's a

375
00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:55.490
little rip rap, rap, a
little plastic one or an

376
00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:59.150
aplastic rather, but a half
plastic, half wood partially kind

377
00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:01.490
of put together hobbyist printer
they have at my kid's

378
00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:05.090
school because it's lack of
rigidity, right? I mean, it's

379
00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:08.240
okay. But if you blow
on it or if the

380
00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:11.300
air conditioner turns on, or
if a kid literally stomps

381
00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:15.050
through the room, it falls
apart. Yeah. I came kicking

382
00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:18.260
and screaming to, I used
to say, when I first

383
00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:22.460
showed my design, these engineers
literally just made fun of

384
00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:24.920
me. They were like, this
is ridiculous. You've got no

385
00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:27.770
rigidity. This isn't going to
work. And I, I kind

386
00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:31.250
of held on to that
thread that I discovered myself

387
00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:34.460
that you, you truly do
only have to get over

388
00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:36.830
the bar. And so I
used to say, well, it's

389
00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:42.050
rigid enough. And it was
rigid enough if like you

390
00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:45.290
say, nobody's stomped through the
room and in the best

391
00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:49.330
circumstances, it was surprisingly good.
But over time as more

392
00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:51.640
and more and more and
more people have bought, I

393
00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:53.890
mean, you can't predict what
people are going to do

394
00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:56.350
with your printer. So rigidity
is something that I've really

395
00:20:56.350 --> 00:21:00.130
adopted as ultimately important. And
so now we're making a

396
00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:04.390
metal, not just plastic instead
of our bars. And now

397
00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:06.550
on the simple middle that
you have, the bars do

398
00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:08.440
kind of hanging up in
the air all by themselves.

399
00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:13.840
But what I'm really recommending
is the handle that ties

400
00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:18.640
those two bars together. It
just reduces the variables of,

401
00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:21.490
you know, some people would
move their printer and by

402
00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:23.890
grabbing the two bars and
when you squeeze them together,

403
00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:26.260
while it's printing, believe it
or not people do this,

404
00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:28.150
they grab the two bar,
squeeze it together and move

405
00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:29.950
it across their desk. And
now they've just screwed up

406
00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:33.820
their print. So anyway, rigidity
is King 12 millimeter bars

407
00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:35.920
is kind of a standout.
We use those on the

408
00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:39.610
simple, but rigidity is so
important if you want reliability.

409
00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:42.180
Well, and once I got
it and the term I'm

410
00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:44.760
using is, is dialed in.
Once I got this thing

411
00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:47.760
adjusted, I put little rubber
feet on it, you know,

412
00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:49.980
just went to Michael's and
got some little rubber feet.

413
00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:53.460
Okay. And it's on a
very sturdy desk and it

414
00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:56.430
just works. I think I've
had, I've printed 10 things

415
00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:58.290
in the last 10 days.
And one of them has

416
00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:02.550
failed. Really? What failed, I'm
curious, the, the wire, what

417
00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:04.680
do you call it? The
there's a plastic thing that

418
00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:07.950
has a bundle of wires
that goes from the back

419
00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:10.020
of the box into where
the fan and the extruder

420
00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:13.080
are. Oh, sure. Yeah. It,
the thing I was printing

421
00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:15.600
as quite tall, as about
four inches tall. So as

422
00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:19.560
it moved, it, it kind
of, Oh right. The cable

423
00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:21.780
bundle that comes out of
the external vendor, we need

424
00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:25.140
to suspend that. Yeah. We
need to suspend that on

425
00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:27.480
a little sprung structure that
holds it up out of

426
00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:30.720
the way I've had prints
fail for that to now

427
00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:35.310
nine out of 10 worked,
were they long prints or

428
00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:38.790
short prints? Every print that
I've done of, it has

429
00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:43.140
been basically between five and
seven hours Dough that's long.

430
00:22:43.170 --> 00:22:45.630
Is that bad? That's cleanly
in the long category as

431
00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:50.190
well. Yeah. So I do
the at three notches below

432
00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:54.390
slowest. What does that mean
Above? There's a, in the

433
00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:59.670
<inaudible> tool. Yeah. There's how
fast what's your millimeters? This

434
00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:02.640
a minute or whatever it
is. Is it second or

435
00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:06.330
minute? 40 millimeters. A second.
Okay. Yeah. That's that's three

436
00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:10.260
or four notches. It's average,
honestly. I mean, we can

437
00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:13.930
go to 80 if you
really are crazy, but I,

438
00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:17.040
I print it 50 actually
50 or 60. You print

439
00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:18.690
it 50. Okay. That would
be right smack in the

440
00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:21.990
middle of the, this particular
bar. Yeah. So I do

441
00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:25.290
infill density, infill density for
folks that are getting tired

442
00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:27.780
of us. Speaking out here
is the, you know, the,

443
00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:30.060
the density of the inner
parts. If you make a

444
00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:32.010
complete solid cube, you don't
want to waste all of

445
00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:33.990
that. So you know, all
that plastic, so you basically

446
00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:37.530
make a mesh inside. So
I do 15% infill and

447
00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:41.760
about 30% mil, 30 millimeters
a second. And I do

448
00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:43.740
them overnight. Basically. I know
it's bad. The house could

449
00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:46.810
burn down, but I, I
hooked up a camera. It's

450
00:23:46.810 --> 00:23:50.080
metal. It could catch on
fire. It'll just drop off

451
00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:52.870
and have a little campfire
on your, on your bed.

452
00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:56.290
I do have the camera.
So, and I haven't, so

453
00:23:56.290 --> 00:23:59.170
I have a little camera
pointing at the thing and,

454
00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:01.180
and I, and I can
certainly see what happened and

455
00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:02.500
I can, yeah, I can
see clearly. And all I

456
00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:04.990
did to solve that cable
problem was I just got

457
00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:07.300
a zip tie, which is,
which brings me to my

458
00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:09.910
next question, which is, it
seems like for the first

459
00:24:09.910 --> 00:24:12.100
four or five prints, all
I did was print stuff

460
00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:13.810
to make it better. You
know what I mean? And

461
00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:15.520
we're not saying it wasn't
awesome to start with, but

462
00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:18.220
all of the personality types
of the people who are

463
00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:20.110
into three D printing is
just filled with people who

464
00:24:20.110 --> 00:24:22.600
are like, well, there's a
flaw in this design and

465
00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:25.390
I built this crazy plastic
piece to fix it. Yeah.

466
00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:28.930
It's funny because, you know,
remember I come from a

467
00:24:28.930 --> 00:24:34.150
Kickstarter where my Kickstarter was
printers that were printed. So

468
00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:37.660
I, my original printer bought
was a rep wrap, a

469
00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:40.090
totally open source. I opened
source document all my stuff

470
00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:43.360
now, but back then I
had this one design. If

471
00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:45.280
you didn't have a printer
about it, you could still

472
00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:47.770
download the files for free
and print your own. You

473
00:24:47.770 --> 00:24:50.320
still have to get like
threaded bars and pairings and

474
00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:54.490
stuff. But so I come
from, you know, iterate, iterate,

475
00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:58.030
iterate, make this better, print
your printer. And so there's,

476
00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:00.010
there's still a remnant of
people that like, they like

477
00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:02.530
to modify their printer and
add all these add on.

478
00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:06.160
Some of them are ridiculous,
but it just makes me

479
00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:09.940
laugh. If you go on,
you know, I put my

480
00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:14.860
files on you. imagine.com Y
O U imagine it's owned

481
00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:20.140
by Ultimaker. But I used
to put them on Thingiverse.

482
00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:22.960
I do sometimes browse thing
versus to see what's going

483
00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:26.860
on. Cause it's a large
community. But anyway, if you

484
00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:28.540
go and think of verse
and search for printed, but

485
00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:31.930
you will see the craziest
people printing the craziest stuff

486
00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:34.120
to do the craziest things
to their printer bot. It's

487
00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:36.580
hilarious. But that's why I
love our design. It's easy

488
00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:40.270
to do that. There's very
little to do to your

489
00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:43.960
printer when it's inside of
box, like a lot of

490
00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:45.970
the printers out there, and
I'm not just picking on

491
00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:48.730
MakerBot, I've always said, it
looks like a microwave oven.

492
00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:51.490
To me, it's about the
same size, but a lot

493
00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:53.830
of printers are like that.
They just, for rigidity sake,

494
00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:57.580
they put walls around all
sides. And then what are

495
00:25:57.580 --> 00:25:59.500
you going to do to
it? You know, it's like

496
00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:02.890
really there's no, mine is
like wide open bare bones.

497
00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:05.470
Add something on the top.
You made a spool holder

498
00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:07.600
on top, put a camera
on the front of the

499
00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:10.480
bed, put the feet on
the bottom. There's people that

500
00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:13.600
extend the X and Y
to what like 12 inches

501
00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:15.550
by 12 inches on that
bought that you have it's

502
00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:19.840
insane. That can be done.
Absolutely. Yeah. So I got

503
00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:23.560
to make it print more
space. Just think about the

504
00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:27.640
Z. Take those now it's
it's nontrivial to press those

505
00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:29.470
bars out. You gotta like
hit it with a hammer,

506
00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:32.170
but you could do longer
Z bars and a longer

507
00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:36.880
acne rod from McMaster-Carr right
now spend about, well McMaster-Carr

508
00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:39.250
is expensive, but you could
find him for like 50

509
00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:43.240
bucks and you could have
a 16 inch tall Z.

510
00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:46.830
It's really easy to mod.
Wow. There's a, we have

511
00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:50.100
an upgrade on our little
makers kit. That's normally just

512
00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:53.280
a little four by four
by four cube. And all

513
00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:55.860
you need is a wider
bed and bars and belt.

514
00:26:55.890 --> 00:26:59.400
That's it. So people buy
these like 18 inch long

515
00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:03.090
bars and they got like
a little like a training

516
00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:05.370
wheels on the outside of
the bed to keep it

517
00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:07.770
from tipping, the bot over
and everything. It's just nuts.

518
00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:11.550
It's funny to do that.
Search printer bot on Thingiverse.

519
00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:13.790
It's funny when people are
doing, I do like that.

520
00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:16.040
One of the things that
you kind of, you, you

521
00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:18.890
force the user to do,
like in the onboarding is

522
00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:20.780
you say, okay, you've got
it set up. You printed

523
00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:24.140
a little cube. Good job.
Congratulations on your cube. Now

524
00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:26.060
the first thing you're going
to do is print a

525
00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:29.150
little, you call it a
fan shroud. And basically it's

526
00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:33.380
a, it looks like a
traffic cone that directs the

527
00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:37.250
fan down into the, the
extruder, Right? So that's one

528
00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:40.460
of, that's the best example
of how people begin to

529
00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:44.600
upgrade their bodies from day
one. And I say, upgrade

530
00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:48.350
really what I'm saying is
like a convenience thing. This

531
00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:50.420
it'll work without the fan.
In fact, I have printers

532
00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:53.480
at my shop that don't
have that shroud, but it's

533
00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:57.200
just a little bit better
with that shroud. So we

534
00:27:57.620 --> 00:28:00.830
forced them to kind of
go through the learning process

535
00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:05.420
of see you can print
useful things, not just like

536
00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:09.620
little plastic octopus or key
chain holders or whatever. I

537
00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:12.050
mean, you know That my
family teases me because they're

538
00:28:12.050 --> 00:28:13.700
like, Oh great. You're going
to print us a bunch

539
00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:15.860
of crap for Christmas. I'm
like, well, you're darn right.

540
00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:19.520
Expecting plastic robots for Christmas.
That's going to happen, but

541
00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:22.190
Might have to walk before
you run. So why not

542
00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:25.100
just force them to, and
now that the risk in

543
00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:28.310
that by the way is
some people don't. So then

544
00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:32.120
they get less than excellent
results on their cooling because

545
00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:34.520
the fan shroud directs, you
know, most of the air

546
00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:36.350
flow down to where it
needs to be to cool

547
00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:38.840
that plastic quickly and you
get a better surface finish.

548
00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:41.840
So I've, I've kind of
weighed, you know, are we

549
00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:46.250
really helping people by forcing
them to print something that

550
00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:49.880
I would consider an essential
addition? You know, you mentioned

551
00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:53.240
the feet too. Like we
may, you may see us

552
00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:55.490
add that fan trout and
the feet and who knows

553
00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:58.790
the handle, the spool holder
as, as a, you know,

554
00:28:58.790 --> 00:29:01.850
something that comes with the
kit, but it's just great

555
00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:03.830
to have something in front
of you that you can

556
00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:06.590
bolt something onto that you
printed on your first print.

557
00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:08.690
People do love it. I
will say that we get

558
00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:12.980
great feedback on that first
print up. I think that

559
00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:16.430
the, the, it was, there
was an empowering experience because

560
00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:18.560
it wasn't just printing this
piece and it snaps on,

561
00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:20.570
you had to unscrew some
things and take it apart.

562
00:29:20.570 --> 00:29:23.090
And it made me not
afraid of the printer. Right.

563
00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:25.600
And it made me say,
Oh, okay, well, if, if,

564
00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:27.650
if he says that this
is a design that might

565
00:29:27.650 --> 00:29:30.510
improve it, maybe other people
might. And I, I, I

566
00:29:30.570 --> 00:29:32.000
added a couple of things,
like you said, I added

567
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.650
a spool. I added the
feet. I put a little

568
00:29:33.650 --> 00:29:36.320
camera on the side. I
don't think I'm quite ready

569
00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:40.040
to take the metal parts
apart and make the things

570
00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:43.090
longer. But I do have
a sense of, of, of

571
00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:45.280
power that, that I like.
And I, I went to

572
00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:47.830
my dad who has a
it's funny. So I go

573
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:50.260
to my dad's, my dad's
shop. And I say, I

574
00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:52.180
got three D printer. You
know, it's pretty amazing. And

575
00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:55.270
I said, I'm a maker
to now now understand I'm

576
00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:59.080
standing in my dad's garage.
And in my dad's garage

577
00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:04.030
is all this woodworking equipment
and, and saws. And he's

578
00:30:04.030 --> 00:30:06.370
got one of those, like
fans mounted on the, on

579
00:30:06.370 --> 00:30:09.310
the ceiling that sucks the
sawdust up forever. And he's

580
00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:12.820
calling me a dork. He's
saying I'm a geek. And

581
00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:16.330
he's literally saying this without
realizing that he's standing amongst

582
00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:20.050
his generations makers stuff. Right.
So I'm trying to convince

583
00:30:20.050 --> 00:30:22.570
him that like woodworking and
that level of kind of

584
00:30:22.570 --> 00:30:25.870
like, you know, making geekery
is just like, I'm right

585
00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:27.580
there with you, man. I'm
just doing it in plastic.

586
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.740
And we're arguing about whether
or not which one of

587
00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:32.560
us is a maker. That's
awesome. My brother says, you

588
00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:35.230
know, guys, it's just two
sides of the same 12

589
00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:40.350
sided dice. I think we're,
you know, Dale Doherty, who's

590
00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:44.550
the guy that founded make
magazine. He was with Tim

591
00:30:44.550 --> 00:30:48.720
O'Reilly on a rally media.
He is great because he's

592
00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:52.920
like a big kid. And
when he talks about making,

593
00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:55.890
it just resonates because he,
his belief and it is

594
00:30:55.890 --> 00:30:59.520
mine as well, is that
we're all makers. And I

595
00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:02.190
challenged that when I talked
to him for the first

596
00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:04.380
time, I'm like, you really
think we are because I

597
00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:07.680
believed, but I wanted to
hear him articulate. But think

598
00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:11.190
about, think about just your
everyday life. We are constantly

599
00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:16.080
making something we're creative beings.
I think that it's just

600
00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:19.740
in our DNA to make
stuff and to put things

601
00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:24.030
together. I mean, Legos resonates
with all ages. Just, you

602
00:31:24.030 --> 00:31:27.270
know, even like when I,
when I play Minecraft with

603
00:31:27.270 --> 00:31:28.860
my kid, I'm like, Oh,
this is the kid's game.

604
00:31:28.890 --> 00:31:32.250
No, I want to build
the biggest baddest castle I

605
00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:36.450
eat in there, whether it's
cooking, which, you know, you're

606
00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:41.970
making dinner or you're drawing
on a whiteboard, or it

607
00:31:41.970 --> 00:31:45.240
just doesn't matter. We're constantly
when I mow the lawn,

608
00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:48.240
I, I look at like,
how straight are my lines?

609
00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:52.830
Everything we do is, is
a kind of tied to

610
00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:56.340
making things. I mean, even
procreating, we have children, we

611
00:31:56.760 --> 00:32:00.540
were constantly making. And so
when you unlock that little

612
00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:04.620
like, Oh, I can actually
do something that didn't exist

613
00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:07.590
a minute ago. And I
had a part in that,

614
00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:11.070
especially when you get people
to start designing, they're like,

615
00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:13.500
Whoa, that didn't exist before
I thought it. And then

616
00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:15.270
now it's here in my
hand. There's just like this

617
00:32:15.270 --> 00:32:19.020
magical thing that happens where
there's a, you kind of

618
00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:22.740
validate this urge that we
all have to make. And

619
00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:24.240
then you hold it in
your hand, you give that

620
00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:27.480
guest the heart pen in
or whatever. There's something so

621
00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:32.160
incredibly satisfying about adding something
to the universe that is

622
00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:34.560
just, it's hard to even
explain. It's kind of metaphysical

623
00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:38.670
or spiritual. Almost. It absolutely
is. And I, I honestly,

624
00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:40.910
I couldn't, it, I couldn't
say it better when I,

625
00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:43.910
you know, I downloaded things
from Thingiverse and I made

626
00:32:43.910 --> 00:32:46.400
other people's things, but then
when I couldn't get that

627
00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:50.570
school to fit and I
made an adapter and then

628
00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:52.160
I had dinner and I
came back in there, it

629
00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:55.010
was, it was, it was
weird. I mean, I mean,

630
00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:57.950
it was, it was like
star Trek. Yeah. Yeah. It

631
00:32:57.950 --> 00:33:00.590
took, it took a couple
hours, but that didn't exist

632
00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:02.990
before I thought it and
made it. And now it's

633
00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:05.270
here and it is solving
a problem for me every

634
00:33:05.390 --> 00:33:08.710
single day. I think wild
too, about this is cut.

635
00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:11.980
It's not really off topic,
but it's related. So there's

636
00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:17.620
something about also sharing what
you have made yourself to

637
00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:19.930
other person. And it's not
just like, you know, I've

638
00:33:19.930 --> 00:33:23.710
showed, shown people, things I've
drawn or a website I've

639
00:33:23.710 --> 00:33:27.070
done or whatever. And there's
something like, there's a disconnect

640
00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:29.650
when you can't actually touch
it. And when people hold

641
00:33:29.650 --> 00:33:32.620
it and feel the weight
and the texture and they

642
00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:35.110
turn it over and they
see the bottom and then

643
00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:38.620
they instantly understand like infill
and overhanging, they see the

644
00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:41.950
lattice work and the translucent
PLA or whatever. I got

645
00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:44.530
to tell this quick story.
So when I first started

646
00:33:44.530 --> 00:33:49.060
printing with my first three
D printer, I designed the

647
00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:51.790
first thing I designed this
may tell you something about

648
00:33:51.790 --> 00:33:56.290
myself was a bottle opener
to open your beer. And

649
00:33:56.950 --> 00:34:00.250
I uploaded it to Thingiverse.
And I thought I made

650
00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:02.860
this thing. I'm made this.
Now. It was kind of

651
00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:04.660
a riff off of another
one I saw, but the

652
00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:07.150
other one was like clunky.
The first thing I printed

653
00:34:07.150 --> 00:34:09.280
was a bottle opener. And
I just wasn't, I was

654
00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:10.780
glad to have it, but
wasn't pleased with how it

655
00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:13.000
looked. So I made the
design better and then I

656
00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.980
uploaded it and I was
like, that's awesome. I made

657
00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:19.870
something. And then literally it
was probably two hours later.

658
00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:23.320
I get this alert on
my email thing. And it

659
00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:26.620
said, somebody downloaded your, or
no, it actually told me

660
00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:31.210
somebody made your thing, this
thing that I uploaded. And

661
00:34:31.220 --> 00:34:34.840
I'm like, what somebody made,
what I designed. This is

662
00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:37.720
awesome. And so I go
online and the guy had,

663
00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:40.180
he was so kind, I
gotta look this guy up.

664
00:34:40.390 --> 00:34:44.890
He, he posted a picture,
a real picture of the,

665
00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:48.430
the thing that he printed.
And I was like, no

666
00:34:48.430 --> 00:34:51.460
way somebody pre somebody printed
what I designed a couple

667
00:34:51.470 --> 00:34:54.100
hours ago and he's holding
it in his hand. And

668
00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:57.880
so I read the details.
He was on his boat

669
00:34:58.450 --> 00:35:02.650
off the coast of Australia.
Wow. And he was sitting

670
00:35:02.650 --> 00:35:05.980
there with his Corona that
he had opened with the

671
00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:09.130
bottle opener that I designed.
You put a penny in

672
00:35:09.130 --> 00:35:11.080
it and it helps you
open your bottle. And it

673
00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:13.750
just blew my mind. And
like forever changed. I was

674
00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:18.370
like, Oh my gosh, I
just physically came in contact.

675
00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:21.400
My ideas physically came in
contact with a guy on

676
00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:25.720
the other side of the
world and he's enjoying himself.

677
00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:28.450
Maybe it was the beer,
but in part it was

678
00:35:28.450 --> 00:35:30.940
the bottle opener. So I
was just like, this is

679
00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:35.380
beyond just creating something and
like having the satisfaction it's

680
00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:39.870
beyond sharing this, someone else
In the room, this is

681
00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:43.440
sharing it with the world
in a very real way.

682
00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:47.430
And it just blew my
mind. Absolutely. Fantastic. Thank you

683
00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:49.680
so much, Brooke, from, from
printer, but for talking to

684
00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:51.870
me today, this has just
been an absolute joy and

685
00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:54.360
I do hope we stay
in touch. Oh, my pleasure,

686
00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:57.150
Scott, anytime. Thanks for what
you're doing. Then this has

687
00:35:57.150 --> 00:35:59.700
been another episode of Hanselminutes
and we'll see you again

688
00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:00.330
next week.
