talks with Steve Beauregard about
Bitcoin. Hi, this is Scott

10
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.580
Hanselman. This is another episode
of Hansel minutes. I'm chatting

11
00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.480
with Steve Beauregard, founder and
CEO at go coin. And

12
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.350
I want to understand Bitcoin
and why I should care.

13
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.590
Steve, why is everyone going
insane about Bitcoin right now?

14
00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.800
Thanks for having me, Scott.
Well, you know, the, the

15
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.130
primary reason is if you
look at the world, 75%

16
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.190
of the people in the
world can't participate online in

17
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.270
commerce or byproducts, and Bitcoin
changes that. So it's the

18
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.390
on ramp to get the
unbanked. And, you know, the

19
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.270
people that don't have credit
cards participating on the, on

20
00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.640
the internet is that that's
really, it. It's just that

21
00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.190
there are people who need,
need to have a place

22
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:41.930
to hold money and they
just, they don't have an

23
00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.850
account. They don't have a
visa card. They don't have

24
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.480
a way to a PayPal
account. Yeah. And in many

25
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.330
cases that the unbanked population
is huge and most of

26
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.840
these people have computers. They
have smartphones and you know,

27
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.820
but they don't have bank
accounts and that's a lot

28
00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.820
of the developing countries have
that problem. So a lot

29
00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.490
of people also, you know,
they want Bitcoin for the

30
00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.180
speculative purposes in the U
S and in Europe. However,

31
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.090
the utility of the invention
is really far greater in

32
00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.690
the developing countries. Don't you
think though, that in, in,

33
00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.900
in the last kind of
couple of months, it's pretty

34
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.690
clear that it's techies that
do this. Do you really

35
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.780
think that developing countries and
people out there have any

36
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.960
idea what Bitcoin is? I
mean, you're describing a world

37
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.520
that seems a little bit
farther in the future when

38
00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.940
it's more mainstream. Yeah. And
I am, I am describing

39
00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.430
the future and it is
mostly technical people today that

40
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.340
have Bitcoin or people that,
you know, had extra hardware

41
00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.890
laying around in a, a,
they ran a miner and

42
00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.740
they developed, you know, they,
they got coins and yes,

43
00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.090
those are a lot of
the people that have it

44
00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.350
today. However, they've really provided
the backbone. If you will,

45
00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.130
of the Bitcoin network such
that it will support now

46
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.380
this worldwide peer to peer
network of, of payments. What

47
00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.880
about other alternative non Bitcoin
things in developing worlds? Like

48
00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.810
I know Kenya has Their
own digital currency that's used

49
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.200
where they send some via
SMS. Don't you think that

50
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.440
those things that are more
entrenched in an emerging economy,

51
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.870
like for example, Kenya, or
have a better chance of

52
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.720
winning? Yeah. The pace is
very interesting because many times

53
00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.580
the fees with the M-Pesa
in Kenya can be as

54
00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.310
high as 40%. So, and
yet the people are still

55
00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.650
using it and adopting it,
and it really shows that

56
00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.760
they need the utility. So
in the, in a world

57
00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.680
where I believe that, you
know, pigs get fat and

58
00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.130
hogs get slaughtered, I think
40% is way too rich

59
00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.460
for a, for a fee.
Whereas Bitcoin, literally you can

60
00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.480
have a transaction for pennies.
Hmm. So you're saying that

61
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.480
that in paisa, because it
has relationships with, you know,

62
00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.780
Safari comm the mobile networking,
old people over there and

63
00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.930
Vodafone that it really is
an example of the rich

64
00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.770
taking advantage of the poor.
Yeah. And, and in many

65
00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.600
cases, but, you know, don't
get me wrong. It does

66
00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.350
have a lot of utility.
And, and that's oftentimes the

67
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.860
signs of an early market.
They found an opportunity yet.

68
00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.370
You know, anytime somebody starts
making money with a system

69
00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.220
like that, it's going to
bring in innovation and innovators

70
00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.230
are going to come in
and, and find better, cheaper

71
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.300
ways to do things that,
you know, can take advantage

72
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.390
of it. I've heard people
describe Bitcoin as the, kind

73
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.260
of the democratization of, of,
of currency. And we're kind

74
00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.040
of releasing the, the, the
idea of money out into

75
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.230
the world and getting the
governments out of the way.

76
00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.310
Certainly one of the, one
of the goals of it

77
00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.940
is to, you know, create
a currency that can't be

78
00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.370
devalued by just printing more
and printing more and printing

79
00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.000
more. And, but I don't
see it as necessarily competitive

80
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.210
with, with, you know, government
issued currencies. I think they're

81
00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.870
going to coexist for some
time to come. And, you

82
00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.550
know, I think that's the
right way to think about

83
00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.380
it, but it is, it
is the people's money. It

84
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.250
is, you know, giving you
control back over, over your,

85
00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.310
your own credit situation and
your own, you know, what,

86
00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.710
what you've earned. Okay. So
you, you seem like you

87
00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.940
have a much more kind
of measured businessperson's perspective on

88
00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.190
this. I hear a lot
of, you know, kind of

89
00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.740
revolutionary types online that are
thinking like, know, this is

90
00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.810
it, this is the end.
It's the people's money. It's

91
00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.800
the end of currency and
the military industrial complex. And

92
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:17.940
then I'm hearing people like
you that are like, well,

93
00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.430
this is another, another exchange
in other, a way for

94
00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.460
us to move money from
place to place. Yeah. And

95
00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.580
more efficient way to do
that. I revert back to

96
00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:30.000
the rule of going to
Las Vegas, the house always

97
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.970
wins. So if you keep
it in perspective that the

98
00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.040
house will win, don't think
that you're going to get

99
00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.350
away with not paying taxes.
Don't think you're going to

100
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:41.100
get away with, you know,
cutting the government's out of,

101
00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.640
of, of being in control
of this because I, yeah,

102
00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.100
I don't take that. I
don't subscribe. Subscribe to that.

103
00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:50.520
Let's talk a little bit
about this, the, the process

104
00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.290
and the currency. When I
have, when I have a

105
00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:54.240
wallet, that's the first thing
I need to do to

106
00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.550
get Bitcoin, right. I have
to have a wallet and

107
00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.330
this is a file. It's
just a file on my,

108
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.030
on my device, somewhere on
my computer, on my phone.

109
00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:06.820
Yeah. It's a set of
programs. And, you know, inside

110
00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.130
of that wallet, there is
a private key and a

111
00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:11.860
public key. So think of
the, the public key, like

112
00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.950
your routing number at your
bank, anybody, you have no

113
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:16.630
problem giving that out to
somebody and say, you know,

114
00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:20.170
here's my routing number wire
money to my account, but

115
00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:22.630
your private keys, like your
pin, you don't give that

116
00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:24.640
to anybody. You that's, you
know, the way that you

117
00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.740
can then access your money
and transact. So that's the

118
00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:31.030
private key, which is stored
and most modern wallets have

119
00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:34.450
that file encrypted on the
local machine. So they can't,

120
00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.670
you know, you required password
to get to it. Okay.

121
00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:40.150
And that wallet, that file,
it is truly a wallet

122
00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.870
in the sense of don't
lose your wallet. Absolutely. It's

123
00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.390
actually, the private key is
really the, the component you

124
00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:49.210
can't lose. So that should
be backed up, put away

125
00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:52.870
in a safe, you can
even print out that key

126
00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:55.990
and, you know, store it
in multiple places. But anybody

127
00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:58.810
who can get access to
that key can access your

128
00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:02.290
coins. Okay. If I do
lose my wallet, but I

129
00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:05.350
have my private key, I
heard, I understand that in

130
00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:08.710
Bitcoin, there's this concept of
labor transaction history that can

131
00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:10.960
I recover my wallet as
long as I have the

132
00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:14.440
private key. Absolutely. Yup. That's
the whole power is you

133
00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:17.680
can, you know, inject that
private key into a different

134
00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.710
wallet and voila your access
to your money as restored.

135
00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:24.640
So my public Public key,
my public visit my public

136
00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:27.250
address. I understand this concept
of addressing people are saying,

137
00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:29.350
what's your public address? It
looks like it's a kind

138
00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:31.540
of a guru at the
global unique identifier. And that's

139
00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:33.490
not something I have to
be fearful of. I can

140
00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:36.370
give it to anyone, put
it on Twitter. That's right.

141
00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.460
That's right. And that's a
34 character string and very,

142
00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:43.720
you know, uppercase lowercase numbers
embedded. And that string is

143
00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:46.450
your public address and you
can send money or anybody

144
00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:49.060
can send money to that
address. And is the, is

145
00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:51.550
that something that could run
out? Are there enough of

146
00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:53.770
those for all the people
in the world, wherever? Oh

147
00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.470
no, you do. You would
never run out. I, I

148
00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:58.510
can't quite do the math,
but you take, you know,

149
00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:01.480
all of the upper case,
lower case alphanumeric plus a

150
00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:04.660
numbers and 34 characters long
yet you, you have a

151
00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:06.340
lot of the combination. So
it is a, it is

152
00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:09.760
a goo, it's a global
unique identifier. Yes. And when

153
00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:13.750
someone then sends me money,
let's say, I've got my

154
00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:16.840
public key and you're going
to send me some fraction

155
00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:21.940
amount of Bitcoin. You're sending
it where, So it goes

156
00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:26.170
into the public blockchain. So
the blockchain is a, there's

157
00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:29.170
a copy of the blockchain
on every single mining computer.

158
00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:32.020
And it used to be
wallet, but I won't get

159
00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:35.140
into the detail of that.
But everyone is agreed to

160
00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:37.840
all of the transactions in
history among all of this

161
00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:41.950
peer to peer network of,
of mining notes. Okay. So

162
00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:45.670
what happens is when you
send your money, that transaction,

163
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:48.700
it gets picked up and
validated by the miners and

164
00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:51.280
added to the blockchain. So
it's like cemented in history

165
00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:55.000
that that particular transaction, and
then the balance on, on,

166
00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:58.170
on your wallet will, will
be reflected in the blockchain

167
00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:01.370
as well. So there's this,
there's a finite number of

168
00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:04.070
Bitcoins. At some point before
the sun death of the

169
00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:09.110
universe, we will know that
we found them all. Well,

170
00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:10.910
it, yeah, it's not a
matter of finding them every

171
00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:14.570
10 minutes, 25 new Bitcoin
come into existence. And that's

172
00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:17.510
going to go on pretty
much until the year 2140.

173
00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:19.010
It could be a little
bit longer. It could be

174
00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:21.770
a little bit shorter, but
it's really up to the

175
00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:26.870
speed and, and how fast
the, the mining network works.

176
00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:29.930
But 10 minutes is what
it's designed to, to maintain

177
00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:33.980
is the degree of difficulty.
So that every 10 minutes,

178
00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:37.850
25 new Bitcoin are awarded
to a minor. And there,

179
00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:41.180
there they're awarded because that's
the protocol indicates that there's

180
00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:43.670
this there's this tempo to
it, or because this is

181
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:46.460
a math, you know, all
we're, we're trying to calculate

182
00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:48.620
this as fast as we
can. And math dictates that

183
00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:51.050
this is as fast as
we can make them. No,

184
00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:53.180
no, it's really a think
of it. Like a lottery.

185
00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:58.550
Each of the computers is
running a certain algorithm on

186
00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:01.400
a block of data and
it's, and it's trying to

187
00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.710
get an answer in a
certain format. And when it

188
00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:05.480
gets to it in the
format that it's expect that

189
00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.550
all of the nodes are
expecting, it's a bit sit

190
00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:09.800
and broadcast that it, it,
you know, got the answer

191
00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:13.220
and then all the other
nodes will vote. And that's

192
00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:15.410
where the democracy comes in.
They all 51% of them

193
00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:18.440
say, Oh yeah, we agree.
You won. Now that person,

194
00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:22.310
or that particular minor gets
awarded, you know, 25 Bitcoin.

195
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:25.910
And the way the protocol
works is beyond that in

196
00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:28.070
the four years, that that
number gets cut in half

197
00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:29.960
and it continues to get
cut in half every four

198
00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:33.080
years. So most of the
Bitcoin will be, will be

199
00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:35.720
released early. And then as
time goes by fewer and

200
00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:38.450
fewer Bitcoin will be released.
Doesn't that imply that the

201
00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:42.380
people who got in there
earlier and mind are super

202
00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:44.060
rich right now. And the
rest of us it's too

203
00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:46.700
late. No, I wouldn't. I
wouldn't think of it that

204
00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:49.400
way at all. I think
it, it really is reflective

205
00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:52.610
of the fact that Bitcoin
price is anticipated to continue

206
00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:56.180
to go up. So, you
know, mining right now is

207
00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:59.330
a, is it's questionable. Whether
it's worth it from a

208
00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:02.780
standpoint of paying for your
power bill, for the mining

209
00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:06.470
power, however, as the Bitcoin
goes over a thousand dollars,

210
00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:09.690
it will suddenly become worth
it again. So, you know,

211
00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:12.110
sort of a spring effect
that will happen, you know,

212
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:14.900
for years and years to
come, You're using the word

213
00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:19.550
awarded, which kind of implies
a certain amount of meritocracy.

214
00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:21.950
And then you're saying that
there's, there's, there's mining where

215
00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:25.580
there's actual work in crypto,
and we need powerful computers

216
00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:28.970
to, to hunt through math
space. But then you also

217
00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:32.300
said, there's a lottery. Is
this a math problem? Or

218
00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:34.580
are we winning something? No,
no, let me, let me

219
00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:37.160
say, they said, think of
it like a lottery and

220
00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.920
the fastest computer gets the
most lottery tickets. If you

221
00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:42.110
think about it, that way
you can sort of conceptualize,

222
00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:44.600
but when you get down
to actually how it works

223
00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:47.180
is they are trying to
solve a math problem. And

224
00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:50.810
it's a proof of work
algorithm. And it basically, once

225
00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:53.180
they've come up with the
answer in a certain format,

226
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:57.340
that's when they then have
won, if you will, they

227
00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:00.900
won the lottery. Right? So
you're saying that, that, that,

228
00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:03.390
you know, I let's say
I have a giant refrigerator

229
00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:06.060
sized computer in my house
here and I'm mining and

230
00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:07.710
you're mining and we both
get it right at the

231
00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:11.130
same time, then that's where
the voting happens. Exactly. That's

232
00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:12.870
right. And I understand that
there are a number of

233
00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:16.200
people who have built mines.
I think there's a person

234
00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:18.500
either in Iceland or Finland,
where it's very cold and

235
00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:21.330
it's able to build a
lot of machines for, and,

236
00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:23.490
and the, the w the
weather is makes it, it

237
00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:25.350
was okay for him to
be able to run these

238
00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:27.540
machines hot. It makes it
cheaper to cool them. They're

239
00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:30.180
building huge minds. That is
data centers that do nothing,

240
00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:34.260
but look for Bitcoin. That's
right. Yep. What about this

241
00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:38.190
idea that the power consumed
looking for them in computing

242
00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:41.340
is somehow more than the
value of the coin at

243
00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:45.120
least today. Yeah. Yeah. That's
something that will be a

244
00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:47.730
problem for some time to
come and meet people that

245
00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:52.110
are running a Bitcoin miners
on graphics cards. They still

246
00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:54.540
might be getting a fraction
of a penny out of

247
00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:56.670
it. They're not getting much
money, but it's something to

248
00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:59.460
them. And maybe they're in
a apartment where they don't

249
00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:01.560
pay for power, and that's
a part of their deal.

250
00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:05.250
You know, it's a huge
waste that, that situation, because

251
00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:08.670
anybody who's running a non
what they call ASIC, which

252
00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:12.600
is a application specific hardware,
anybody who's running, you know,

253
00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:14.880
you know, old graphics card.
Now you can use graphic

254
00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:18.480
card for different coins. Like,
like coin, for example, is,

255
00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:22.140
is scripted. So that's relying
more on memory than it

256
00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:24.780
is on the computing power,
but, you know, there, there's

257
00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:28.170
definitely a problem with power
consumption and you know, how

258
00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:30.420
serious is it? I probably
not the right one to

259
00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:34.260
answer. Sure, sure. Is there
value in me or my

260
00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:38.190
nontechnical mom to mine? Or
should we just think about

261
00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:41.100
it as a currency that
we can use? You know,

262
00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:43.740
It really, if you only
had a little bit of

263
00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:45.570
money to invest in, in
mining and you wanted to

264
00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:48.390
get in the game, I
would suggest you mind something

265
00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:50.400
else that you mind a
light coin or something, a

266
00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:55.270
script based Bitcoin mining at
this point is a, it's

267
00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:57.240
a it's to the point
where it's beyond the reach

268
00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:02.250
of the average person to
do it effectively. So before

269
00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:04.560
we, we chatted here, I
went and I got a,

270
00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:06.720
I'm a windows user, and
I got multi bit, which

271
00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:08.820
is a wallet for windows
that kind of the standard

272
00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:12.300
wallet. And it gave me,
I put in my mere

273
00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:15.240
very complicated passphrase, and it
gave me a I'm looking

274
00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:17.760
here. I have an address
now. So I put the

275
00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:21.000
address on, on Twitter. And
I said, right. I said,

276
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.030
I'm learning about Bitcoin. And
I just pasted my address,

277
00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:26.940
no request or begging. I
understand that begging for Bitcoin

278
00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:32.070
is considered really quite poor
form. And since you and

279
00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:33.930
I have been chatting just
in the last 10 minutes

280
00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:37.110
here, I've received two transactions.
I'm just sitting here. I

281
00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:39.510
didn't have to push refresh.
It just shows up. I've

282
00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:49.140
got now 2 cents, 0.00016, BTC
a Bitcoin is worth how

283
00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:51.650
much right now, because I
understand that it's always fractions.

284
00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:56.480
Very often. These transactions are
in five, six digit decimal

285
00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:59.650
points. Yeah. It's actually eight
decimal points, but yeah, so,

286
00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:03.370
so a single Bitcoin today
is a, in the $600

287
00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:05.030
range. I haven't checked this
morning unless I looked there's

288
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:09.510
about 630, but you know,
we're starting to talk in,

289
00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:12.340
in bits as a, as
opposed to in Bitcoins. So,

290
00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:14.380
you know, we just move
over a couple of decimal

291
00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:16.600
points. So right now it
would be, you know, you

292
00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:20.200
would be a, you know,
620 bits for per Bitcoin

293
00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:23.410
And in this particular application.
And I know that there's

294
00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:25.900
lots. So I'm not thinking
about this specific one, there's

295
00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:30.550
a status, a status column.
And in that status column,

296
00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:33.910
in this particular application, there's
a pie chart, and I'm

297
00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:35.110
not sure what the pie
charts trying to tell me,

298
00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:38.470
but it's filling up is,
is that mean that other

299
00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:41.320
parts of the blockchain are
starting to learn about the

300
00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:44.350
fact that I just got
2 cents worth of Bitcoin? That's

301
00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:48.580
right. That's a, it's validating
the transactions. So as the

302
00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:52.330
pie gets filled, once it
gets completely full, I think

303
00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:54.070
it turns to a check
Mark or something in multi

304
00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:56.650
bed. And then you, you
know, that yes, that, that

305
00:15:56.650 --> 00:15:59.470
has been validated by the,
by the blockchain. And typically

306
00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:01.660
the, the gold standard is,
you know, when you get

307
00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:05.530
six validations, that's the point
at which the transaction is

308
00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:10.000
considered, you know, completed. So
this almost feels like, like,

309
00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:13.060
like BitTorrent, where everyone's kind
of working together and voting

310
00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:16.030
and chatting, and it's, it's
very conversational, but we're all

311
00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:20.620
trying to just agree that
something is the case. Yeah.

312
00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:22.990
It's very much like BitTorrent
in that it's a peer

313
00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:26.440
to peer network. Everyone has
a copy of, you know,

314
00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:29.440
of the same blockchain and
a, that's a good analogy

315
00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:33.460
actually. And is this, these,
these, these very kind people

316
00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:35.320
on Twitter that are helping
me learn about Bitcoin, who've

317
00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:38.380
given me this penny, you
said that there's transactional fees,

318
00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:40.690
who was there a fraction
of a fraction of a

319
00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:42.670
Bitcoin that was taken out
when this person sent me

320
00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:46.870
these sense? Well, there could
be. Now that really depends

321
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:49.720
on the sender. The sender
has the option to include

322
00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:52.690
a transaction fee. And if
they don't, then they run

323
00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:55.390
the risk of the minor,
not picking it up. So

324
00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:58.660
there's two ways that the
miners make revenue. The first

325
00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:00.550
one is the, you know,
the, the contest that we

326
00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:05.050
talked about, or, you know,
being winning a block and

327
00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:08.080
being rewarded with 25 Bitcoins,
the second is they can

328
00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:13.000
be rewarded with transaction fees
by validating your transaction. So

329
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.970
if, if the sender, you
know, has the good sense

330
00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:19.240
to put a little transaction
fee reward in there for

331
00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:21.370
the minor, it's more apt
to be picked up more

332
00:17:21.370 --> 00:17:23.650
quickly. And the bigger, the
larger, the amount of the

333
00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:27.010
fee, the faster it's going
to be picked up by,

334
00:17:27.070 --> 00:17:32.110
by minors. So I'm looking
here@ablockchain.info, and it looks like

335
00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:35.200
the person who sent me
this appears to be in

336
00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:37.270
Germany. There's a map there.
Is there any way for

337
00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:41.620
me to know who this
person is? Not really, no.

338
00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:45.580
I mean, they could have
put a, a little note

339
00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:48.940
inside of there and sent
you a note saying, you

340
00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:52.140
know, a comment, Hey, this
is, this is, you know,

341
00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:55.990
Nimrod in Germany, and I'm
sending you a big point.

342
00:17:56.280 --> 00:18:00.090
It's used to it, thanks
for your show. But if

343
00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:02.640
they, haven't, there's really not
an easy way to, to

344
00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:06.540
connect to who exactly sent
that Bitcoin to you. However,

345
00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:08.520
over time, I do believe
that, you know, some of

346
00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:12.120
the, once you can identify
a few wallets, it probably

347
00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:15.660
won't be that difficult to
unravel connections to other wallets.

348
00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:19.230
So, yeah, and I think
they've proven through law enforcement

349
00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:22.590
with the case of the
silk road, that it really,

350
00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:25.200
it's not really anonymous. A
lot of people like to

351
00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:28.470
speak of Bitcoin as being
an anonymous protocol and anonymous

352
00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:32.070
wallet, but actually it's very
public and that the ledger

353
00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:35.270
has a copy of every
transaction. And when you nail

354
00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:37.220
it down to an individual,
is it when they change

355
00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:40.820
it from Bitcoin into a,
a country currency when things

356
00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:43.460
become less anonymous, or is
it an, is it not

357
00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:45.950
anonymous even now when it's
in the, in the chain?

358
00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:49.250
Well, I think you, you
do have the IP address.

359
00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:51.800
So in so much that
you can trace back to

360
00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:55.160
an IP address. So you
can see where that transaction

361
00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:58.010
took place or where that
person is sent from at

362
00:18:58.010 --> 00:18:59.570
least down to the IP
address. Now they can do

363
00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:03.080
things to obscure their IP
address and so forth through

364
00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:06.260
something like tour or, or
things of that nature. But

365
00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:11.810
for most people using using
Bitcoin for legitimate purposes, you

366
00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:14.930
know, I, I wouldn't think
to go through that kind

367
00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:18.680
of a, of a hoop
just to send Bitcoin, Starting

368
00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:22.160
to see a lot more
Bitcoin comments show up in

369
00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:25.700
a popular press. It's not
necessarily a nerd thing anymore.

370
00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:27.800
And I'm even seeing it
on television shows. There's a

371
00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:31.490
TV show on Fox called
almost human that's placed in

372
00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:33.650
the far future, maybe 50
to a hundred years in

373
00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:37.580
the future. And almost every
week on the future, they

374
00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:41.270
come upon some criminal and
they find the, the future

375
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:43.040
equivalent of a thumb drive
on him. And they say,

376
00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:45.230
Oh, he's got Bitcoin in
his pocket. How much is

377
00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:49.130
on it? This has happened
consistently. So even my parents

378
00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:52.880
know what Bitcoin is in
the context of Saifai. But

379
00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:54.830
what I think is interesting
about that showing up on

380
00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:58.250
a TV show, like almost
human, is that it's a

381
00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:03.230
mainstream recognition that this may
be around for a long

382
00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:06.280
time. And since you're now
the founder of a, of

383
00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:09.650
a Bitcoin based company, you're,
you're bullish on this, this

384
00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:13.310
is happening and it's not
going anywhere. Absolutely. And in

385
00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:16.070
fact, you know, at go
coin, we're, you know, we're

386
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:17.930
a merchant processor and we
have a lot of, you

387
00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:20.000
know, companies that come to
us and they're very interested

388
00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.100
in taking Bitcoin as payment.
And, you know, sometimes I

389
00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:25.970
was speaking with the folks
at Zynga yesterday and he

390
00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:27.710
said, you know, we really
haven't had the uptake that

391
00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:31.160
we would have expected because
you know, most of our

392
00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:35.150
audience are, are women, you
know, Housewives, oftentimes that are

393
00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:37.970
on playing games and they
really don't have Bitcoin yet.

394
00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.640
So I submit that the
tipping point is going to

395
00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:43.400
be an episode of something
like a, you know, high

396
00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:46.640
Housewives of Beverly Hills, where
they show that a housewife

397
00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:48.850
has that she can, you
know, buy all these things

398
00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:50.230
with Bitcoin and not have
it show up on a

399
00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:52.960
credit card. And so I
think that's the kind of

400
00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:55.210
thing that it's going to
take for awareness, that people

401
00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:57.640
start to see that some
of the utility that, although

402
00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:00.010
it's not completely anonymous, if
somebody really wants to trace

403
00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:03.460
you down, however, by and
large, it's, it's almost as

404
00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:06.730
anonymous as cash in terms
of, you know, where you

405
00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:09.850
spend it. And, you know,
you know, following the trail,

406
00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:13.650
I shouldn't look at Bitcoin
as an anonymous thing in

407
00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:16.500
the context of a, that's
not a feature that we

408
00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:18.330
really want to promote. Like,
yeah, if you want to

409
00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:22.590
move money around and be
sneaky Bitcoins the way You

410
00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:25.170
definitely not, I think a,
you know, cash is still

411
00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:27.360
King when it comes to,
to that type of thing.

412
00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:31.260
So I think if there's
a criminal that wants to

413
00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:34.380
operate in Bitcoin, that they're,
they're in the wrong place.

414
00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:37.200
I think that's a, a
big mistake because the, the

415
00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:39.480
ledgers out there, and I
think of it this way,

416
00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:44.400
remember the Boston strangler case
where recently they, they gathered

417
00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:47.100
some DNA evidence 30 years
ago. And at the time

418
00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:49.380
they didn't have the technology
to really look through that

419
00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:52.830
evidence and be able to
pin that to a particular

420
00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:55.350
person. And then 30 years
later now they do have

421
00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:58.110
the technology and they were
able to, you know, conclusively

422
00:21:58.110 --> 00:22:00.990
prove that this was the
person responsible. I think you'll

423
00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:03.360
see much the same kind
of technologies with Bitcoin. Although

424
00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:06.060
it's hard today to, to
connect a wallet to a

425
00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:09.300
person, believe me, there's people
out there working on it.

426
00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:12.480
And, you know, they'll be
able to very quickly, you

427
00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:16.980
know, sort of put the
puzzle back together. So speaking

428
00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:21.150
specifically about go, go coin
your company. I understand that

429
00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:25.590
there's a lot of complaints
amongst smaller merchants that, you

430
00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:28.620
know, PayPal might hold your
money sometimes. And PayPal is

431
00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:30.330
maybe not a great solution
that was supposed to be

432
00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:34.050
the way for the people
to be able to hold

433
00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:36.960
money and accept money. But
now if there's any kind

434
00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:39.330
of fraud, PayPal will freeze
your account. So there's concern

435
00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:43.500
about that. There's visa fees
is, is go coin and

436
00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:47.040
is Bitcoin a solution for
maybe smaller merchants in the

437
00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:48.840
future to kind of be
able to get their money

438
00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:54.300
and receive and accept currency
over the web? Absolutely. And

439
00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:56.880
I see it solving a
number of problems. You, you

440
00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:58.950
hit the nail on the
head with, you know, the

441
00:22:58.950 --> 00:23:02.310
monopoly that the credit cards
and the PayPal have on,

442
00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:06.330
on, on online sales and
so forth. And that power

443
00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:09.240
of just freezing your account
and freezing your money with

444
00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:11.430
Bitcoin. The, the beauty of
it is you don't have

445
00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:14.490
a charge back when you've
sent the payment through, they

446
00:23:14.490 --> 00:23:17.760
all sales are final. And
so there's, there's no reason

447
00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:19.650
for us to have to
hold the payment up of,

448
00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:23.880
of the merchant, unless there's
some sort of an escrow

449
00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:26.850
service or something that everyone's
agreed to, you know, the

450
00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:29.010
money has been received. So
think of the person in

451
00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:32.430
Nigeria that may want to
buy something online. There's no

452
00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:34.680
way they can use a
credit card. You know, there's

453
00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:36.900
no, no company that would
take a credit card from

454
00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:39.840
Nigeria. However, if they have
Bitcoin and they want to

455
00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:42.150
have some good shipped to
them, there's no reason they

456
00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:44.100
can't push the money there.
And now that the merchant

457
00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:46.700
has the money, they can
ship the goods in. So

458
00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:48.440
it really that's what I
mean by it opens up

459
00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:50.270
a lot of market. The
other thing it really does

460
00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:55.100
is think about a credit
card purchase of $5. So

461
00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:58.310
you've got, you know, three,
four and fee that they're

462
00:23:58.310 --> 00:24:00.230
going to charge, and then
they're going to have 30 cents

463
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:03.360
per transaction. Well, very quickly,
you've completely eroded that, that

464
00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:06.380
value of the transaction with
Bitcoin, we're discharging 1% flat

465
00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:08.420
rate. So now you're going
to be able to do

466
00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:12.650
a $5 transaction, you know,
for, for all of 50 cents.

467
00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:15.760
And is, is that how
go coin will make money?

468
00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:18.640
It's just a flat 1%
and that's how that that's

469
00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:21.670
the future. Sure. Well, the
a that's part of the

470
00:24:21.670 --> 00:24:25.870
equation then of course, you
know, as we take the

471
00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:28.810
Bitcoin in, we are, you
know, trading it at, you

472
00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:31.210
know, on different exchanges and
we'll, you know, find ways

473
00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:35.050
to optimize how and when
we trade. And so beyond

474
00:24:35.050 --> 00:24:38.440
just the 1% we make
as a transaction fee, we

475
00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:41.050
hopefully can, that can optimize
that and do a bit

476
00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:44.020
better than that. I see.
So like any currency where,

477
00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:45.700
where you're holding it, and
it's going to sit with

478
00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:49.930
you for awhile there's opportunities
for, for investment at scale

479
00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:51.530
and all the different kinds
of things that went, you

480
00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:53.560
know, my, my credit union
has my money right now,

481
00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:56.110
and I have no doubt
they're making money on holding

482
00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:57.880
my money and moving my
money from place to place.

483
00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:01.660
Yeah, that's right. I mean,
we, we probably trade a

484
00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:04.060
lot more quickly than that
because we have to mitigate

485
00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:07.330
our risk. So, you know,
as we take coins in,

486
00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:09.940
we, we traded pretty quickly,
but you know, there's many

487
00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:13.870
exchanges around the world and
the, the price that we

488
00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:16.660
give on the, on the
invoice is going to be

489
00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:19.540
an average of the different
exchanges. And you've got a

490
00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:22.840
developer kit for people who
have Ruby or Java or.net,

491
00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:26.590
whatever someone can go and
make a shopping cart that

492
00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:29.500
accepts Bitcoin. And then you'll
basically do all the work

493
00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:33.580
for them. Right. That's right.
That's right. So I think

494
00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:35.860
a bit like, you know,
the, the old days of

495
00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:38.800
e-commerce twin, you know, the
biggest pain was the last

496
00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:41.200
mile when you had to
connect the merchant services up

497
00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:43.240
and do all of the
testing and, and, you know,

498
00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:45.100
get your bank accounts and
go through all of the

499
00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:47.680
stuff at the bank. You
know, we eliminate all of

500
00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:50.530
those kinds of issues. So
we've had a very, very

501
00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:55.480
straightforward set of APIs, client
libraries for the major languages,

502
00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:58.450
plugins for major shopping carts,
like Magento and WooCommerce and

503
00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:01.270
so forth. And, you know,
we're making the OnRamps very

504
00:26:01.270 --> 00:26:03.910
simple. And then in terms
of opening their merchant account,

505
00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:06.580
they literally, you know, fill
out a form on our

506
00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:08.860
site. They upload some documentation
to show that they're a

507
00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:12.370
legitimate, valid business. And then
they're, they're accepting Bitcoin. We're

508
00:26:12.370 --> 00:26:13.840
actually accepting it for them
and paying them out in

509
00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:17.770
cash. And it looks like
you've got all of this

510
00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:21.160
on get hub you've got,
and it's actively being worked

511
00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:22.930
on. I mean, I see
some of these have been

512
00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:26.260
updated just hours ago. That's
right. That's right. We've got

513
00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:30.610
a really strong technical team,
you know, working from, from

514
00:26:30.610 --> 00:26:32.680
various parts around the globe.
We have some developers in

515
00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:36.130
India, some developers in Argentina
and some in the U

516
00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:38.830
S so, So you're handling
the conversion as well. You're

517
00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:41.080
not just a middleman, but
you have the ability to

518
00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:44.070
pay me in, in dollars.
Is that what you just

519
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:47.030
said? That's right. That's right.
So you can, you, as

520
00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:50.060
a merchant can opt to
take your payment in Bitcoin

521
00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:54.020
light coin, you can opt
to take your payment and

522
00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:56.450
your local currency, What is
light coin, and what are

523
00:26:56.450 --> 00:26:58.550
the, what the, why, if
Bitcoin is the way to

524
00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:01.310
move money, why do I
need Kanye West coin and

525
00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:05.840
all these other kinds of
alternatives? Yeah, it's a great

526
00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:09.590
question. Well, you know, interesting
light coin, the, the founder

527
00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:11.690
of Lakewood and Charlie Lee
are the, I guess you

528
00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:14.630
would call him the inventor.
He basically took the open

529
00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:17.810
source blockchain code and fork
the code and made a

530
00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:20.630
couple of significant changes. The
first change he made was

531
00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:23.510
he made it four times
faster. So a block gets

532
00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:26.000
mined every two and a
half minutes, as opposed to

533
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.210
10 minutes on average. The
second thing he did was

534
00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:32.420
rather than using Shaw two
56, he used script based

535
00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:36.650
mine, which is more memory
intensive. And that's, that sort

536
00:27:36.650 --> 00:27:39.710
of made an opportunity for
the, those that missed out

537
00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:41.930
on the early days of
mining bit point to be

538
00:27:41.930 --> 00:27:43.790
able to mind light coin.
And so a lot of

539
00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:47.570
the mining power as, as,
as far back as a

540
00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:50.870
year ago, started going over
to light coin. And the

541
00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:53.090
other thing he did is
he did not pre mine

542
00:27:53.090 --> 00:27:55.550
the blocks. So he made
it fair for everybody. So,

543
00:27:55.550 --> 00:27:57.350
and I said, Hey, we're
going to start a new

544
00:27:57.350 --> 00:28:00.770
coin and already said, go.
And he didn't pre mine

545
00:28:00.770 --> 00:28:02.540
a bunch of blocks and
have a bunch, you know,

546
00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:05.690
sitting in his pocket at
the, at the start. So

547
00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:07.850
many coins is that those
are the questions you need

548
00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:09.140
to ask. When you look
at a coin, was it

549
00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:12.830
pre mine, has somebody sort
of game the system by,

550
00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:14.690
by, you know, having a
bunch of it already in

551
00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:18.560
their pocket before they even
start. And then you also

552
00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:21.110
want to make sure that
they're open source code and

553
00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:22.910
that they've published it up
to get hub or somewhere

554
00:28:22.910 --> 00:28:24.950
where everybody can see the
code, because some of the

555
00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:29.240
coins out there are not
open source. And so you

556
00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:32.990
don't know exactly what's happening
behind the curtain. So it

557
00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:35.150
sounds like there's kind of
a long tail. I mean,

558
00:28:35.150 --> 00:28:37.970
you've got Bitcoin, you've got
light coin, that's got a

559
00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:41.630
market space of almost half
a billion dollars, and then

560
00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:45.020
it pretty much tails off
very quickly from there. Yeah.

561
00:28:45.050 --> 00:28:48.680
And I believe, I truly
believe that that every coin

562
00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:52.730
has a different user base.
And I think the people

563
00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:54.380
that have like wind will
probably going to be a

564
00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:57.050
bit more apt to spend
it. I believe if you

565
00:28:57.050 --> 00:29:00.710
use the golden silver analogy,
you know, gold is more

566
00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:04.550
the, the standard storage of
value. And there's a lot

567
00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:07.370
of speculators that are hoarding
Bitcoin, but they're not really

568
00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:11.180
willing to transact with it.
And my, my thesis is

569
00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:13.100
that I, I believe that
that light coin is going

570
00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:16.010
to be more transactional and
more people will be apt

571
00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:20.390
to spend it Fantastic. And
people can learn about go

572
00:29:20.390 --> 00:29:22.910
coin, go up. There's a
merchant sign up. There's API

573
00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:26.610
docs all up on GitHub.
They can get involved really,

574
00:29:26.610 --> 00:29:31.220
really quickly. Absolutely. Well, I
really appreciate you chatting with

575
00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:35.480
me today and setting me
straight. I've gotten out 2 cents,

576
00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:40.190
so I'm on my way.
Hey, send me your link.

577
00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:42.850
I'll, I'll send you some
more Bitcoin Right away. Very

578
00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:46.090
cool. Thank you so much,
Steve Beauregard from gold coin.

579
00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:48.820
This has been another episode
of Hanselminutes and we'll see

580
00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:49.720
you again next week.
