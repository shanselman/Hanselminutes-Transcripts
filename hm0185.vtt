live from the dev days

7
00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.540
conference in San Francisco. Scott
talks with Joel Spolsky, Jeff

8
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.970
Atwood and Rory Bly. Hi,
this is Scott Hanselman, and

9
00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.580
this is another episode of
Hansel minutes slash Jack or

10
00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.720
flow coming into your own
other space and time. And

11
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.550
here we are content free
backstage at stack overflow brought

12
00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:14.720
to you by Telerik is
brought to you by it

13
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.440
conversations. Yes. The conference is
brought to you by all

14
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.310
kinds of people, stack overflow
Carsonified fog bugs, SmartBear software.

15
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.360
Codera paid for the wifi,
which we did really good.

16
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.240
Really good and turn on.
But yeah, and it was

17
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.180
a nice thought and Microsoft,
Oh, Microsoft is here in

18
00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.600
the lobby upgrading everybody's laptops.
That was sweet. That was

19
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.120
pretty nice. And it wasn't
announced because they didn't want

20
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.910
people to bring their laptops.
Didn't want to let people

21
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.480
know too many, but now
everybody's coming to Seattle will

22
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.730
presumably know to bring their
laptop and just put in

23
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.680
like a 16 K chip
or something. Like I got

24
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.970
16 K and seriously he's
upgrading everyone to four kids.

25
00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.070
He's asking him, went to
the maximum of their laptops

26
00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.370
will hold. Yeah, that's great.
That's Brandon Watson actually just doing

27
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.120
that. He's our cloud services
guy. I'll part of the

28
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.280
value proposition of the dip
days. This has been an

29
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.010
episode of, so, so let
me ask you this it's

30
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.920
a pretty mixed crowd. It
was a, it's an exceeded.

31
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.460
It was really difficult. I
felt for me to present

32
00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.130
what I was doing because
at the end, a couple

33
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.130
of the guys said that
was really great. Thanks a

34
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.040
lot for coming. I'm still
gonna write Mark, right? I

35
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.630
mean, I wasn't here to
pitch them. We were just

36
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.120
really here to kind of
chat, right? Yeah. I mean

37
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.090
like my ideal of this
conference is that if you're

38
00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.600
a good developer, you're constantly
encountering technologies that you wish

39
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.800
you had time to learn
about. And you kind of

40
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.320
wanting to spend more time
with, and pretty much everything

41
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.770
we're doing jQuery, Android, iPhone,
or this kind of things

42
00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.360
that like, I really need
to learn something about this

43
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.030
and see if it's that
interesting. And so we thought

44
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.160
the most appealing possible kind
of conference would be like,

45
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.760
Hey, these are the five
to six technologies that people

46
00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.500
most want to learn this
year. And haven't, and the

47
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.530
fewest people know, but the
most people have heard of

48
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.000
in which they can sort
of learn a little bit

49
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.970
more about. So that was
sort of the organizing theme,

50
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.610
I think. Well, it's also
reflective of the actual user

51
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.160
base of stack overflow. It's
very diverse. Yeah. You know,

52
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.470
we're trying to pitch to
people, you know, get outside

53
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.870
your ghetto a little bit,
like rub shoulders with how

54
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.520
other developers get outside your
ghetto. That's the informal tagline,

55
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.970
not the official one, but
it really is like that.

56
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.470
I mean, you have the
ghettoization where all I do

57
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.810
is X and I don't
really know or care about

58
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.370
any of this other stuff
that's going on. Like for

59
00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.080
example, and this might be
embarrassing to admit, but like

60
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.480
seeing Roy do objective C
was really the first time

61
00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.870
I had really seen objective
C and actually looked at

62
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.600
the first time he'd ever
seen C no, I've seen

63
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.790
C before, but objective C
is a whole different animal.

64
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.130
It kind of made my
face hurt a little, like

65
00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.990
watching an apartment. What are
those little dashes? Little what?

66
00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.630
Little, little dashes. The lines,
the lines start with the

67
00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.740
dash and objective C sometimes.
Okay. Okay. So if a

68
00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.600
line starts with the dash
and objective C, it means

69
00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.970
it's an incidence method. If
it starts with a plus,

70
00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.480
it means it's a studying
method. Oh, okay. I mean,

71
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.380
it's intuitive and obvious. So
cut it. I would have

72
00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.460
guessed comment. I was going
to go with negative using

73
00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:18.100
me as a probably bad
examples. Like this is my

74
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.190
opportunity to expose to iPhone
development. Like probably literally for

75
00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.660
the first time and seeing
it like any kind of

76
00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.790
detail, somebody run through it
in the ID. Cause I

77
00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.650
mean, who has time? Right?
Like I'm kind of busy

78
00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.230
with the things that I'm
doing. So it's nice to

79
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:30.940
get sort of jolted a
little bit. And then it's

80
00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.260
kind of the goal of
stack overflow. And when Joel

81
00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.910
set it up, he did
a good job of matching

82
00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.380
the spirit of stack overflow
to the spread of the

83
00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.940
conference. I thought, So why
wouldn't I just watch it

84
00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.830
online? Say what's the, is
it the fact that we're

85
00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.740
forced into the theater and
we were right. It's like

86
00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.490
a parade of different technologies.
Again, microphones working at this

87
00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.400
conference. The idea of lots
of getting cameras, according at

88
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.200
this conference is above and
beyond. But I actually have

89
00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.550
something on this day, but
not the people that are

90
00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.320
speaking right now. No, we
don't have internet. Yeah. And

91
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.080
what does it meant? So
ghetto, it's not nice to

92
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.750
use the word ghetto for
what this conference is, but

93
00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.950
it's a $99 content entry
level conference call this conference

94
00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.190
ghetto. I think doesn't do
the work ghetto service. Okay.

95
00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.170
This is not a bad
conference, but we're trying to

96
00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:19.680
do it in a very
economical way. Yeah. You're being

97
00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.090
really hard on yourself and,
and, and no, no, I'm

98
00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:25.920
serious. So after doing so
many of these things, like

99
00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.430
talking about the promises I
walked right in and both

100
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.950
times just stuck the lapel,
right? Yep. Pull my red

101
00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:33.990
on me and it worked
right. And I actually went

102
00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:35.760
in the back and I
was talking to Scott in

103
00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.800
the dressing room and I
had a lapel mic on

104
00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.440
the whole time. I never
switched to intro to standby.

105
00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.900
I had no idea that
it was actually on, but

106
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.910
it turns out I wasn't
broadcasting because the staff was

107
00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:47.130
good enough to know that.
Well, that was on Ustream

108
00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.480
no, no. Yeah. You're right.
You're right. So they didn't,

109
00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.680
they've actually been really, really
good. That's true. It's called

110
00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.810
Carson. Those guys are Carsonified.
Yeah. The only thing that's

111
00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:01.460
wrong with this conference at
this point is the internet.

112
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.840
And let's wait let's every
conference, no one ever expects

113
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.820
to get an IP address
at a conference. That's the

114
00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:09.920
way yeah. It can't be
done. That's what we, that's

115
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.840
what we've discovered. Who was
really good though, that you

116
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.710
probably picked that they figured
that out Buddha was not

117
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.900
good in LA. So we're
making up for that. Yeah,

118
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:19.580
but it was good in
Boston. It was good. In

119
00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:23.540
another plan for Seattle. I
don't know. I'd get to

120
00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:25.880
probably get surprised by this
every time. We'll see who

121
00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:33.410
we have. You Rory, Rory,
not Jeff. Me. There'll be

122
00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:35.840
a few others. We've got
an academic guy, Steve sights

123
00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:41.900
in from university of Washington.
I'm tired. I'm tired. Tired.

124
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:46.340
I don't even know my
schedule. Oh, every other day.

125
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:48.890
Yeah. I'm basically doing one
of these conferences Monday, Wednesday,

126
00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.650
Friday for three and a
half weeks. So that's what

127
00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:56.300
that's, what's kind of killing
me. So since, since this

128
00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.550
has gone nowhere in 14
minutes, and even though Rory

129
00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:01.160
is raising his hand, do
you have a question? Is

130
00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.620
this the first conference you've
ever put on? Pretty much.

131
00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:06.590
Okay. You really do need
to be using yourself very

132
00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:11.300
well. I'm just saying, I'm
just saying, thanks. What's all

133
00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.840
this about duct tape. Oh,
we're going to talk about

134
00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:18.250
content. Like this is going
to be substantial. I just

135
00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:23.480
got deleted duct tape. I
think people misunderstood. What I

136
00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.820
meant about buck duct tape.
Duct tape is a simple

137
00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:29.360
tool that gets something done.
And the duct tape programmer.

138
00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:31.550
I like invented that word
instead of saying quick and

139
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:33.440
dirty programming like that because
it's not what I meant.

140
00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.810
I meant this is a
different kind of programmer who

141
00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:38.960
was always afraid to use
like these latest gadgets that

142
00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.190
they just heard about it
on a Hanselman it's a

143
00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:43.160
week before. And it just
came out, which are awesome.

144
00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:46.580
Don't get me wrong. But
sometimes you have a really

145
00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:47.990
critical project and you're trying
to get it to work.

146
00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:49.670
Listen, let me give you
an example just from, just

147
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:51.560
from the conference, all the
audio visual of the conference

148
00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.840
you've got, and we know
this is podcast is we

149
00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:57.140
all know this is podcasters.
This is a real mic.

150
00:07:57.140 --> 00:08:02.540
This is a professional like
this connector. Thanks for that.

151
00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.900
And my back back and
my back and my back

152
00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:08.930
and my back, that's an
XLR connector. It's bounced. There

153
00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:11.630
are three, there are three
power. There are three wires

154
00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:14.570
going through here because it's
bounds. It's not from radio

155
00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:18.830
shack. You could get maybe,
nah, not this nice. And

156
00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.820
you got plugged into decent
M audio gear. Now we

157
00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:25.460
could be using one of
those little radio shack, cheapo

158
00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:28.100
or Kmart microphone. You know,
that comes like my first

159
00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:30.110
karaoke machine. And you could
have a plugged into a

160
00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:31.910
laptop and be like, what's
wrong with my laptop. It's

161
00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:34.070
got a little mic port
on the side and you

162
00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:35.830
could try to do a
podcast that way. And it

163
00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:38.060
kind of work. And after
15 minutes, your little recorder

164
00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:41.150
app would crash or just
things would go wrong. And

165
00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:42.920
the same thing happens at
a conference you've got kind

166
00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:45.590
of high end Davey tools,
high end video tools, high-end

167
00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:48.470
internet access. And if you
don't have that, then it

168
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:50.360
doesn't work. It's the internet
access they have here is

169
00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:53.030
an airport express. That's a
consumer grade thing. That's not

170
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:55.170
a high end thing and
it just falls down. It

171
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:59.550
doesn't. So the duct tape
programmer says, listen, I know

172
00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:01.830
that you've got your fancy
digital giga that I can

173
00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:04.230
get for only 1995. And
it's all awesome. And it

174
00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.480
lets me run my whole
conference digitally and all the

175
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.550
mix could be digitizing right
here and sending it onto

176
00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:11.220
an IP network and blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah. And

177
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:13.920
they never ever do that
at real conferences in real

178
00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.200
shows, in real plays, they
use the same old, old

179
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:19.800
school. This XLR thing was
invented in 1903 or something.

180
00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:22.350
I mean, it's the same
exact interface it's been around

181
00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:25.530
since the beginning of time,
which was 1903. Well, I

182
00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:27.360
don't know. It's just the
beginning of like electronics. The

183
00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:34.510
XLR has a ridiculously old
interface. It's from the old

184
00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:37.980
to the old, the old
days of radio, right. Or

185
00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:40.910
the three of us were
born certainly. And that stuff

186
00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:43.820
still works. It's like simple.
So let me make sure

187
00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:45.590
I understand. So it's about
two things. It's about pro

188
00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:48.380
level versus consumer level. It's
also about tools that have

189
00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:50.930
like a long history of
being well established and well

190
00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:53.690
understood. The guy, the guy
doing the mic, Roy that

191
00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:55.370
you were saying was doing
an awesome job and he

192
00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:57.470
needed to cut you off
and stuff like that. He's

193
00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:59.270
been on the road. He's
been a roadie for 30

194
00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:02.150
years. He's been doing rock
concerts. He, he had that

195
00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:03.710
look. I mean, I looked
at him and he looks

196
00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:06.110
like a roadie. Who's been
doing this for, And not

197
00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:07.610
just that you didn't even
catch this, but in the

198
00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:09.830
mean, the morning he had
a way of talking to

199
00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:12.170
you, that puts you at
ease about the AAV, which

200
00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:13.970
he's learned at the 30
years of how to make

201
00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:16.760
the performers not stress out
about the equipment. And you

202
00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:18.860
know, just that kind of
like telling little funny jokes

203
00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:21.200
and stuff like that, and
just basically calming everybody down

204
00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:24.500
around him, bedside manner, bedside
manner. Exactly. And that's just

205
00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:25.760
like, it takes a lot
of experience. It takes a

206
00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:27.830
lot of, and he's not
going to use some new,

207
00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:30.620
crazy, ridiculous. He's just going
to plug in and you're

208
00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:31.880
gonna be like, why don't
you have this all on

209
00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:34.580
a big old audio IP
network with super, and then

210
00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:36.890
instead of having 400 of
these cables going from the

211
00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:38.360
front of the house to
the back of the house,

212
00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:41.030
you got one little cat
five, which somebody steps on

213
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:43.160
the whole thing goes down
and nobody knows what happened

214
00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.370
because it's interfering with some
who knows what and with

215
00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:48.650
the XLR, it's a well,
you know, to solve problems.

216
00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:51.170
Well, no problem. The downs
cables and whatnot. So it's

217
00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:53.930
also known versus unknown new
stuff tends to be less

218
00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:56.660
well known, less tested just
by virtue of being newer.

219
00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:58.550
It's kind of a little
bit suspect, even though it's

220
00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:02.120
better. Yeah. Ultimately it will
be better ultimately, when we

221
00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.670
may want to use It
may win. So is this

222
00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:08.090
about picking things, picking a
technology to get the job

223
00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:10.880
done at the appropriate level
Adoption curve? Like for example,

224
00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:14.270
I picked Vantis. Yeah. Like,
I don't know, six years

225
00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:20.660
ago. Yeah. For about five
years, but I haven't had

226
00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:22.880
a problem with Vonage for
the last year. It's like,

227
00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:25.520
you got one at a
sixth grade in all seriousness

228
00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:28.310
though. It's solved now voiceover.
Right. He worked, but it

229
00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:30.500
took a half decade to
like pull it off. I

230
00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:32.240
think people don't realize how
long it takes for some

231
00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.970
of the, the technologies that
we're using in code to

232
00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:36.890
like get to that point
where you understand it. Well

233
00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:39.620
enough. I mean, we're always,
especially given the web and

234
00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:41.780
the nature of things going
on. See, did you see

235
00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:45.800
your computer? Just <inaudible> me
now? My computer is just

236
00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:49.280
either falling apart. Yeah, no,
it's just a, it's just

237
00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:52.370
like screensaver time now I'm
not blogging, but that you

238
00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:54.160
can't have that happening in
a conference. In fact, it

239
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.560
did this morning at a
little movie stopped in the

240
00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:03.060
middle because this is actually
a battery for that. I

241
00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:06.060
see these require Phantom power,
but also your iPhone battery,

242
00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:08.730
isn't it? Yes. That is,
that is my best portable

243
00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:13.170
battery pack slash laptop. I
remember one of my favorite

244
00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:15.540
photos of Scott carrying around
a little, like a ultra

245
00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:17.400
mini PC and like using
it to power his life.

246
00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:19.680
I saw like this is
my battery pack for my

247
00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:22.710
iPhone. So yeah. So why
don't people get on a

248
00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:26.100
twist about the duct tape?
I think that what they,

249
00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:28.140
they, they saw the duct
tape programmer and they thought

250
00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:30.270
of the, the style of
program and we just slapped

251
00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:32.190
and duct duct tape on
something. And that is something

252
00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:34.410
that a duct tape program
will do. Cause a duct

253
00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:38.430
tape is well understood. And
B sometimes is you're in

254
00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:40.860
a rush to ship so
that your company doesn't go

255
00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:43.650
out of business and it
is worth incurring technical debt,

256
00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:45.990
right? Like we all, we
all already saying technical debt

257
00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:47.670
these days is if that's
a bad thing, you're going

258
00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:49.890
to have to pay that
down, but taking a little

259
00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:51.330
debt. And another way of
looking at is taking the

260
00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:53.910
leverage. It allows you to
get code done more quickly

261
00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:56.070
so that you can ship
it. Now. Then there are

262
00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:59.250
people that are just really,
really determined to say that

263
00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:03.390
being an extremely slow and
cautious developer and writing TDD

264
00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:06.600
test for all your getters
and setters is a actually

265
00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:09.540
makes you write code faster.
And most of the good

266
00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:11.880
developers, I know many of
the good developers. I know

267
00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:16.590
don't actually think that way.
So, so that's like, whoops,

268
00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:18.420
now I just got myself
in trouble without even getting

269
00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:21.690
myself out of trouble. But
what happened is that the

270
00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:23.490
teeth people read the article
that duck they program. And

271
00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:26.730
they said, Oh, Joel is
about to write saying dirty

272
00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:30.090
programming is good, sloppy programming,
gunslingers, fastest gun in the

273
00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:32.820
West, whatever bad crappy programming
is good. And that is

274
00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:35.430
not what I was saying
at all whatsoever. It seems

275
00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:38.550
like if you had said
something more Software craftsmanship is

276
00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:40.980
good or the Yankee workshop
is a great show on

277
00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:44.670
people Would have been really
boring. Well, I know the

278
00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:47.400
title was link bait now,
but it had to be

279
00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:50.010
like, don't, don't you? I
mean, I shop at Ikea.

280
00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:52.790
Yeah. I sit on my
Ikea couch and I watched

281
00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:55.410
the Yankee workshop and I
see how this guy is

282
00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:58.140
like using like the tools
that Laura Ingalls Wilder, his

283
00:13:58.150 --> 00:14:00.960
grandfather used to make, you
know, and he works for

284
00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:03.480
six months to make a
chair and that chair will

285
00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.910
live forever. And don't, you
kind of sit on your

286
00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:09.180
Ikea couch and gosh, wish
that you had that kind

287
00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:13.590
of tool or that talent
or that whatever, Sometimes, sometimes

288
00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:16.230
it's worth doing. And sometimes
it doesn't make sense cause

289
00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:17.760
you're just opening a coffee
shop. That's going to have

290
00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:20.400
the best coffee and Portland.
And you want to get

291
00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:22.770
a couch that people can
sit on so that you

292
00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:25.680
can open it and you
have X dollars and having

293
00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:27.630
the nicest craft and blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah, is

294
00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:29.010
not going to bring you
any closer to having a

295
00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:31.770
successful coffee shop. So you
kind of have to decide.

296
00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:35.280
And sometimes you're not, not
everything. It's not always appropriate

297
00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:39.060
to use the most gold-plated
tool in the world for

298
00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:40.920
what you're doing. Sometimes it's,
what's not in sending out

299
00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:42.180
and getting it out to
the people so they can

300
00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:44.430
use it and try it
and give you money for

301
00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:47.370
it. I just want to
say, I'm also totally Not

302
00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:49.200
advocating that people go out
and just do really sloppy

303
00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.290
job stuff. But yeah. And
I'm not naming any or

304
00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:53.510
any people or any companies,
But I have been involved

305
00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:57.050
in some projects since leaving
Microsoft where there were times

306
00:14:57.250 --> 00:15:01.000
Since leaving Microsoft. Yeah. Since
leaving Microsoft, where, where there

307
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.320
have been times when release
of software was delayed because

308
00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:07.660
there was a perfectionist aspect
of the code. And the

309
00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:09.760
reality is when users are
using your stuff, like they

310
00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:11.620
don't know what it looks
like underneath and they don't

311
00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:13.450
care if it works. And
if it's not perfectly done,

312
00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:15.250
it doesn't really matter. Like
get it out there and

313
00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:18.640
then give yourself like the
version two release to predefine.

314
00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:20.830
It. Maybe that comes right
back to this whole conference,

315
00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:22.630
which I, which is I'm
sitting here stressing out like

316
00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:25.300
crazy because all kinds of
stuff is not working behind

317
00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:27.310
the scenes. But the bottom
line is the speakers are

318
00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:30.580
on stage and they're teaching
people stuff and their laptop

319
00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:32.690
is being projected on the
monitor. And the people are

320
00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:34.510
sitting in the audience and
learning and that's all we

321
00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:36.610
need. Yeah. You're, you're stressing
out about stuff that I

322
00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:37.810
had no idea it was
even going on. You didn't

323
00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:39.340
even know it was going
on and you're a speaker

324
00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:42.820
let alone. Yeah. It feels
I didn't detect any problems.

325
00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:46.570
So yeah, We arrived. I
walked on stage the equipment

326
00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:50.830
worked and did my talk
people applauded. I stepped off.

327
00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:52.810
I didn't have a problem
with anybody. It was just,

328
00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:56.080
yeah, except for the world,
except for those guys. And

329
00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:59.950
they're starting to work. It's
a verb again. It's another

330
00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:02.890
NBC framework Like for like
rails, but it's not rails

331
00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:06.790
rails itself. Okay. It's another
Ruby. It's Ruby. It's a,

332
00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:10.900
I think it's a Ruby
NBC framework. Okay. But it's

333
00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:13.600
fun. It's more fun to
say Merck is to say

334
00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:16.000
rails. So they use, it
sounds like a guy sounds

335
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.830
like some dude named Merv
is out there. I'm not

336
00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:20.500
even if I state my
opinion of, of the Ruby

337
00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:24.970
programmers, this, this, this, this,
this, this, this, this it's

338
00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:27.190
going to be brains in
a room. Thing is turned

339
00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:29.710
into. Let's see what wacky
stuff we can get Joel

340
00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:34.900
to say I'm giving up.
Oh yeah. So when it

341
00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:36.760
comes down to what wacky
stuff, can we get someone

342
00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:40.300
to, Let's give the mic
to Rory. Okay. Could you

343
00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:41.920
give me like a question?
Did you just want me

344
00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:43.540
to extemporize? Cause I can
do that for hours. I

345
00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:47.080
can just talk for hours
seriously. I'm sorry. What my

346
00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:50.710
sister was here, which is
most exciting program. She's not

347
00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:52.390
exactly a program. And she
worked for the San Francisco

348
00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:59.200
bar. She was like a
clerical worker and the whole,

349
00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:02.740
you know, the attorneys. Yeah,
no, yeah. She's not like,

350
00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:06.100
yeah, no, it's, it's the
whole attorney referral service center.

351
00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:09.400
And she didn't really, she
wasn't a coder. She was

352
00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:12.160
assuming like data entry and
she didn't like the data

353
00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:15.280
entry out there using those
written access. So she went

354
00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:18.460
and decided to just rewrite
the thing without asking anybody

355
00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:21.610
and eventually changed the way
that her department was doing

356
00:17:21.610 --> 00:17:25.150
the business. And then some
of the classic software engineering

357
00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:27.850
story, it was awesome. And
some people were so impressed

358
00:17:27.850 --> 00:17:28.990
that they were like, Hey,
why don't we go off

359
00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:30.940
and start a business? So
now she runs a business

360
00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:35.020
that specializes in providing a
web and software services to

361
00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:38.380
people in legal profession. She
doesn't actually code like code

362
00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:40.240
code, but I went to
her office yesterday and she

363
00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:42.160
has like, she has jQuery
books on the shelf, which

364
00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:44.800
I was like CSS, jQuery
books, man. Like that was

365
00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:50.280
weird. He's right. Yeah. No
there's there's stuff. My sister

366
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:51.690
knows that I dealt with
and she just picked it

367
00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:56.840
up out of nowhere. But
she, she Started coding almost

368
00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:59.690
before I did right back
in 1984. I think she,

369
00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:02.120
well, it was 83, 84.
She wrote a first app

370
00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:03.560
and like, she kind of
got me going. And so

371
00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:05.000
it was neat to have
her here. It was really

372
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.130
neat to have her here.
And I don't know if

373
00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:07.880
she dug it. So wait,
is there any truth your

374
00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:12.230
sister actually wrote a Am
I okay. I was writing

375
00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:17.330
software for the timing Sinclair
1000 in 1983. And she

376
00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:20.510
wrote the first app on
an IBM PC. She beat

377
00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:22.520
me to that. All right.
And I saw what she

378
00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:25.130
did and I was jealous.
And then I went and

379
00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:26.420
I went up there and
then I two up there

380
00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:28.640
and then I just, it
was a factor of, you

381
00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:32.300
know, Virgilian Timex Sinclair. 1000
was the programming, had the

382
00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:34.460
programming language where instead of
saying print, which would take

383
00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:37.130
five bites, you a peak
period to save three bucks.

384
00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:39.520
Well, it wasn't just, yeah,
they had that. They had

385
00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:42.020
a weird keyboard where you
didn't actually type, you would

386
00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:44.060
hit a button that's at
print. Yeah. That would just

387
00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:45.770
stick everything. Yeah. It was
bizarre. And you had to

388
00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:47.690
retype it every single time
because you had no storage

389
00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:49.820
format and ours is upgraded
to, I think two K

390
00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:53.360
of Ram. It was a
great platform for learning because

391
00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:55.100
you had to write your
app every single time you

392
00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:57.770
wanted to use it. Those
calculators that they had in

393
00:18:57.770 --> 00:19:00.140
those days that, you know,
like the T I M

394
00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:04.100
as a Texas instruments, programmable
calculator and the HP 65.

395
00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:06.200
And you know, you had
about a hundred instructions that

396
00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:08.480
you can store every time,
every time. But this look

397
00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:10.790
up to the TV. Oh
yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. I

398
00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:12.350
wrote a spreadsheet for one
of them. Not just kidding,

399
00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:16.460
Speaking of missing. So I
missed when programming was like

400
00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:19.460
hard, you know what I
mean? Like it wasn't like

401
00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:21.800
building stuff with Legos when
you were actually yeah. Inventing

402
00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:24.560
new kinds of labels, you
know, what's funny is how

403
00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:26.120
many we have. We have
speakers. How many of the

404
00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:28.490
speakers today? But we're basically
doing like the first year,

405
00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:31.070
first VB, 1.0 app like,
Oh look, and then I

406
00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:34.640
clicked the cute, the cute
guy, the iPhone. I mean,

407
00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:45.110
<inaudible> he wasn't cute. No.
Well, okay. I don't get

408
00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:49.910
in trouble. QT is Nakia
is now owned by Nakia.

409
00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:54.740
Yeah. Parents are pronounced Nakia.
Yeah. It's definitely not yet

410
00:19:56.360 --> 00:20:00.040
finished. Yeah. I just know
he spoke French. It's the

411
00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:03.350
things you can learn. So
what did he actually do?

412
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:05.330
What happened? He basically made
an app that was one

413
00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:06.920
of these hello world. Like,
look, look what I did

414
00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:08.840
in VB. 1.0, I just
made an edit box. And

415
00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:10.010
when you click on it,
it adds it to the

416
00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:12.260
list box below there. And
his was kind of cool

417
00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:14.240
because it ran on Symbian
devices and it ran on

418
00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:15.830
Unix and it ran on
Mac. What you didn't show

419
00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:18.470
any ran on windows, but
I mean, we're still doing

420
00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:20.380
these. We're still coming up
with these new frameworks and

421
00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:22.560
anything like that. And the
demo it gets, everybody started

422
00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:24.950
it. He's always like, you
know, look how I have

423
00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:28.580
a box and edit box
that sends a text, you

424
00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:31.280
know, parameter to a method
on some other box that's

425
00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:34.160
on his page. And that's
a, that's kind of what

426
00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:36.950
all these apps do. It's
all visual basic 1.0 It

427
00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:39.740
is kind of beginner. No,
it is. And that's the

428
00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:41.960
exciting thing. And that's why
I've always liked mobile. Like

429
00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:43.310
when I went to the
pocket PC back in the

430
00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:45.380
day and it was just
an embedded visual basic and

431
00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:48.010
embedded a visual C plus
plus you really had to

432
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:50.170
Make a lot of stuff
up. Right. And that's one

433
00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:51.520
of the reasons I enjoy
the iPhone is that it's

434
00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:54.190
actually still hard. Right. And
you like the iPhone, cause

435
00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:57.670
it's hard for you. You
have to deal with, it's

436
00:20:57.670 --> 00:21:00.640
funny. When I was working
in visual basic six, the

437
00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:03.160
thing that I enjoyed the
most was working on the

438
00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:06.370
Palm pilot at night. Yeah.
One of the applications that

439
00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:07.690
I worked on in the
Palm pilot, cause I have

440
00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:09.640
my forecast stack and I
did the whole thing and

441
00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:12.340
see the most like the
most like, like you don't

442
00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:14.530
have a programming experience where
you like lift your hands

443
00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:17.410
in victory, like hero on
heroes. Like one of those

444
00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:22.600
experiences, it was drawing a
circle. Exactly. Because the iPhone,

445
00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:26.320
the iPhone computer, it was
the gluco pilot application. Okay.

446
00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:29.020
Application for diabetics in the
Palm pilot. And what was

447
00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:31.420
significant about it was that
there was no floating point

448
00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:34.750
and there was no math
library. So I had to

449
00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:36.670
take an integer and chop
it in half and do

450
00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:40.240
fixed point math. And then
the screen was like 160

451
00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:43.510
by 160 pixels, like an
old QuickTime movie. But there

452
00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:45.910
was talk about going to
three 20 by three 20,

453
00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:47.230
which was going to be
huge. So I wanted to

454
00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:50.110
be future proof. So what
I ended up doing was

455
00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:53.830
building a array in a,
like a, like a static

456
00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:57.910
resource that described a 1000
by 1000 circle and then

457
00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:01.770
scaled it appropriately and then
wrote co-sign and sign stuff.

458
00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:02.830
And then was like, all
right, now I'm ready to

459
00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:06.400
draw some dots. Right? Well
there's no get pixel or

460
00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:08.740
put pixel on the early
Palm pilot. So then your

461
00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:10.900
ex ordering it directly to
memory, you know what I

462
00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:13.060
mean? And then, then you
go on, you show your

463
00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:16.180
wife, Hey, I drew a
circle on this tiny device.

464
00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:18.460
He's like, yeah, great. And
you've been up how many

465
00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:22.210
nights? And this is paying,
this is paying the mortgage.

466
00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:24.670
How man, the victory, you
know what I mean? The

467
00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:27.630
accomplishment, One thing I would
like to comment on is

468
00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:29.970
that there's so much mobile
here. I mean, it's really

469
00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:32.220
surprising how much energy there
is in the mobile space

470
00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:34.950
that wasn't really there three
to four years ago. And

471
00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:36.870
so between web and mobile,
it's like what happened to

472
00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:40.470
the executable styler? And you
know, it's like, where did

473
00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:42.030
that go? This seems to
be where all the energy

474
00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:43.950
is right now. And just
one comment on the iPhone

475
00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:46.800
stuff. And, and I It's
10 times the penetration, right?

476
00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:48.660
Like you're going to reach
10 times as many people

477
00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:51.570
on any little cell phone
devices here. Cause it's their

478
00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:54.510
computer. Yeah. Cause it's even
our computer. Right. Everybody who

479
00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:56.400
has a laptop has a
phone. And then there are

480
00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:58.470
all these people that just
have phones if their phone

481
00:22:58.470 --> 00:23:00.390
too. I think that's the
other crucial thing is that

482
00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:04.320
they have phones. Right? They
gotta have phones. Yeah. I

483
00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:07.680
was in Tanzania a couple
of, well last, last Christmas.

484
00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:12.480
And we were driving between
Urrutia Tanzania and the border,

485
00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:14.310
the Southern border of Kenya
to pick up my brother

486
00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:16.020
in law. And we were
out in the middle of

487
00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:20.250
nowhere and I'm getting uncomfortable
and the brakes overheat and

488
00:23:20.250 --> 00:23:23.370
the driver is pouring cold
water on our brakes. And

489
00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:26.730
we're standing in the middle
of nowhere. And I mean,

490
00:23:26.730 --> 00:23:29.640
there's no bigger words than
that. I'm like, I am

491
00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:34.710
alone with this driver in
freaking Kenya. That's why I

492
00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:36.990
look at my phone calls
by the side of the

493
00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:39.570
road with the vultures there.
It was, it was pretty

494
00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:42.900
much exactly like that. There's
like, you know, African, what

495
00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:45.860
are those tumbleweeds going by
and stuff. And then I

496
00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:47.780
see a guy in the
distance like, Oh right now

497
00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:50.360
I'm going to get killed
by a massage. Yeah. Well

498
00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:54.350
he was walking by full
Mussai regalia, the whole thing,

499
00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:58.610
texting he's texting. So I
look at my, I look

500
00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:02.150
at my Blackberry and it
says, Kenya, sell five bars.

501
00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:07.070
Wow. You could not see
anything in any direction. And

502
00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:10.550
we had five bars and
people were chilling. Yeah. And

503
00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:13.700
they use SMS over there.
Well, that's the best way

504
00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:16.730
to get on Twitter. Yeah,
exactly. That's all my Mussai

505
00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:19.520
friends are Twittering. No, but
they, they, they, they do

506
00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:23.300
market. They have the complete
eBay marketplaces on SMS with

507
00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:26.660
L use short codes to
describe what they're selling and

508
00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:30.170
hook up with with other
people who are selling stuff.

509
00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:33.160
What You can say, don't
they also, they have like

510
00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:37.150
these little one person, mobile
phone companies to Africa. Yeah.

511
00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:38.770
I'm talking about, I'm talking
about like the one person

512
00:24:38.770 --> 00:24:40.870
who has the cell phone.
They like lease out cell

513
00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:43.180
phone, time to the other
people. It's not called a

514
00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:45.280
neighborhood. Talk about Africa. We're
not talking about like the

515
00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:47.230
city, right? Like if you
go to the city, you

516
00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:49.060
can get an iPhone. I
was in Johannesburg and they

517
00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:50.560
have an iPhone and they
have windows mobile phones and

518
00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:52.830
they've got 3g in their
house. No, I'm saying about

519
00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:54.640
the middle of nowhere where
there's that one person who

520
00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:56.440
has the phone. Yeah. Yes.
So the person who owns

521
00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:58.810
a phone can set up
a little table and what

522
00:24:58.810 --> 00:25:01.030
they do, what they actually
had there in Tanzania was

523
00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:05.590
a desk phone with a
cell phone adapter. So basically

524
00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:07.780
you have like this cell
phone that is just a

525
00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:10.750
place to plug in your
desk phone. And they would

526
00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:12.220
set up a cardboard box
on the side of the

527
00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:14.770
road. And they would say,
it's like one shilling, one

528
00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:16.930
Tanzanian shilling per minute. And
you can talk on the

529
00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:18.820
phone and you just sit
there on a desk phone

530
00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:21.880
in the middle of nowhere
for shade. Oh the cardboard

531
00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:26.560
boxes with opponents sitting on.
But it's back to your

532
00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:29.620
point. It's all about communication.
And there's actually a buddy

533
00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:32.650
of mine. Who's got a
project called the <inaudible> project,

534
00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:35.560
which is trying to make
an online Swahili dictionary and

535
00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:38.620
he wants to make it
available via SMS so that

536
00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:41.620
someone who doesn't speak English
could text an English word

537
00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:44.230
to the dictionary and then
get back the equivalent word

538
00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:46.390
in Swahili. That would be
like an example of a

539
00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:49.150
really cool app that you
could write that would not

540
00:25:49.150 --> 00:25:51.160
necessarily be like a, an
iPhone app. It'd be more

541
00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:54.280
like a text gateway. Yeah.
They're also using it for

542
00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:57.730
doing things. Like I know
that in India to ensure

543
00:25:57.730 --> 00:26:01.240
the produce like, so they
don't purchase more inventory, say

544
00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:04.120
like dairy, perishable items than
you can ever actually use.

545
00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:06.100
Like they've got these really
complicated networks of people who

546
00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:08.620
are just SMS in each
other and ordering like a

547
00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:10.150
certain amount of dairy based
on a certain amount of

548
00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:11.800
orders, et cetera, et cetera.
I mean, it's kind of

549
00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:14.710
bizarre, like how totally integral
the whole thing is like

550
00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:21.040
the, Yes, it's just like,
FIDOnet, FIDOnet over SMS for

551
00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:24.340
dairy. And I hope that
our listeners can write in

552
00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:27.130
the comments about if you
are in fact from Africa

553
00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:28.750
or from India from way
out in middle of nowhere

554
00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:31.120
to validate that we're not
just a bunch of white

555
00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:34.420
guys talking about stuff we
don't know about nowhere. Is

556
00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:39.220
that what you're saying? I'm
saying that Africa, India, and

557
00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:45.210
then also South Dakota. Okay. Do
we have any South Dakotans

558
00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:48.900
here tonight? Where does John
Sheehan? I don't know. Yeah.

559
00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:51.390
He's from Minnesota and he's
probably from Minneapolis. My brother

560
00:26:51.390 --> 00:26:54.180
lives outside Portland in the
middle of nowhere and he

561
00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:55.530
moved out there so he
could have a couple of

562
00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:59.400
acres and everything. And they've
been out there three months

563
00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:01.680
now and they finally broke
and his wife called and

564
00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:06.650
he's like, I need internet
There's 24, four. Is that

565
00:27:06.650 --> 00:27:09.170
fast? I'm getting 24, four.
Is that good? Like, I

566
00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:12.590
think that your cables are
dirty. You're someone needs to

567
00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:14.780
go and scrape the copper.
So they're going to go

568
00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:17.060
either satellite or DS and
they're only three miles out

569
00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:20.180
of town. Can they get
DSL or actually, you know

570
00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:23.510
what, a cable, the cable
cable as much better penetration

571
00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:26.750
and yeah. Yeah. From what
I remember, it's about distance

572
00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:30.500
from the central Office has
limited distance over copper, but

573
00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:34.220
cable works better. Hey everybody,
this is Scott coming at

574
00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:36.680
you from another place in
time. No doubt. You probably

575
00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:39.260
bumped into testing tasks now,
and then, and your work

576
00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:41.870
and, you know, writing functional
tests is probably not your

577
00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:44.150
favorite thing. It's kind of
difficult. It takes time and

578
00:27:44.150 --> 00:27:46.700
the results can be dubious.
Well, get ready to start

579
00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:50.360
liking tests. Thanks to Tellerik
with the, the new whereby

580
00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:54.260
testing framework building web automation
test is a breeze. You've

581
00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:58.070
got code automation with advanced
asp.net, Ajax and certified applications.

582
00:27:58.070 --> 00:28:00.680
You can write a single
test, have it executed against

583
00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:04.130
multiple browsers at once. You'd
benefit from a rich API

584
00:28:04.130 --> 00:28:07.670
there's link support integration with
visual studio, unit testing, also

585
00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:11.030
end unit X unit and
MBE unit, not to mention

586
00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:13.880
the free rappers for Telerik
rad controls for ESPN and

587
00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:17.450
Ajax and several light, all
shipping with Telerik's new testing

588
00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:20.900
tool. One of the best
features, the webinar testing framework,

589
00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:23.780
which is developed by art
of test is it's absolutely

590
00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:27.830
free. Freddie got hooked on
web testing framework, start using

591
00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:31.370
it right away, go to
tellerik.com for more info. Thanks

592
00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:34.310
a lot. Staying with the
theme of mobile development. So

593
00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:36.740
I really enjoyed Roy's iPhone
presentation, but I got them

594
00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:39.020
and I was really kind
of horrified like by objective

595
00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:40.790
C and you sort of
hinted at this, you're like,

596
00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:42.590
well, I'm going to start
repeating a lot of stuff

597
00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:44.360
and I'm going to do
this stuff over and over,

598
00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:47.030
and I'm gonna use all
these brackets that kind of

599
00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:48.680
makes sense. And I thought
you, you had a good

600
00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:50.830
way of explaining it. And
I think it was, it

601
00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:52.160
was neat. Maybe you could
talk a little bit about

602
00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:54.590
the juxtaposition of objective C
I'm gonna hand it over

603
00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:58.040
objective C versus a mano
touch, which that seems to

604
00:28:58.040 --> 00:28:59.420
be sorta like the new
hotness of like, maybe this

605
00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:01.160
will get simpler. Cause I
looked at it and went,

606
00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:03.080
wow, that's cool. But that's
like kind of like a

607
00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:05.600
little bit further back in
time, all your eighties analogies,

608
00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:07.280
like back to the future
a little bit further back

609
00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:11.060
in time than I want
to go. So, Okay. So

610
00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:12.470
I got, I got in
some trouble when I did

611
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:15.440
the Don rocks episode where
they interviewed me about iPhone

612
00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:17.630
development. Yeah. Because, and then
I listened to all those

613
00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:19.220
things you said, and I
repeated them on our stupid

614
00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:22.790
podcasts and Miguel was like,
yeah, that's true. You got

615
00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:24.860
us in trouble. Well, that's
the thing. No. So we're

616
00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:29.210
just spreading wrong information. Okay.
Well, well, okay. So I'm

617
00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:32.060
talking to Carl and you
know, we're just making conversation

618
00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:34.580
and I'm thinking, this is
a show for.net developers. So

619
00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:36.470
I'm presenting the information from
the point of view of

620
00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:38.540
a.net developer. What does it
done? A developer need to

621
00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:40.970
know about iPhone development? Right.
And the first thing is

622
00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:43.690
objective C is nothing Like
any dominant language you've ever

623
00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:47.320
used. And to me it
was a little bit, it

624
00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:49.660
was a little bit scary,
right? You're getting away from

625
00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:53.920
your fancy easy dot notation.
Properties are a completely different

626
00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:57.700
thing. Everything has a different
name, right. And interface from,

627
00:29:58.210 --> 00:30:00.910
from Dianetta, it's called a
protocol and objective C a

628
00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:03.340
a method is a message.
And they actually are technically

629
00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:06.250
different. There's all these just
weird, bizarre things. And, and

630
00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:09.040
they're holdovers from like 1996.
And that's why I say

631
00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:11.770
that installing the Ivan SDK
is like installing a flux

632
00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:14.350
capacitor inside your computer. Right.
You just go back in

633
00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:18.160
time and you code like
it's 1980s again, right? Yeah.

634
00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:26.850
Yeah. And, and, and, and
I actually, at first it

635
00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:28.530
scared me, but I started
to really enjoy it because

636
00:30:28.530 --> 00:30:30.390
of that bizarreness. Again, we
were talking about it being

637
00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:32.190
a, you want a program
to be a hard again,

638
00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:35.070
you should learn objective C
with me, I've been, I've

639
00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:38.070
been working with Chris Ellis
actually weekend after weekend doing

640
00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:40.290
F and velvet with him.
And we just been banging

641
00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:44.280
our heads on keyboards at,
at times, Chris sells is

642
00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:46.260
brilliant. Right. But, but there
are things that we run

643
00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:50.460
up against that he's not,
we're not, we're not even

644
00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:53.430
gonna talk about that. We're,
we're apparently iPhone developers in

645
00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:56.760
that freaking hard because people
are doing it. We know

646
00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:59.010
what we know now. There's
a certain, there's a certain

647
00:30:59.010 --> 00:31:01.590
level of iPhone like the
first year or so of

648
00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:03.470
iPhone development is going to
be people writing dinky little

649
00:31:03.510 --> 00:31:05.580
apps that takes them 16
minutes to drag to get

650
00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:08.190
other things and selling them
for 99 cents. And that that's

651
00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:10.170
going to work for a
year or so because it's

652
00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:13.470
no competition. But the minute,
you know, as the platform

653
00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:15.120
matures, you have to write
some pretty good apps to

654
00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:17.850
beat up. I mean, you
know, I just, I just,

655
00:31:17.850 --> 00:31:19.710
just think about like, you
want to have a little

656
00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:22.890
application to track how much
you weigh every day. And

657
00:31:22.890 --> 00:31:25.290
pretty soon that becomes, you
know, all the exercises that

658
00:31:25.290 --> 00:31:26.430
you did that day. And
then it's got to have

659
00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:28.230
videos showing you how to
do more exercises. And then

660
00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:30.600
it's got to have a
measure, your biceps feature and

661
00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:32.160
all kinds of stuff. This
stuff just gets added. It

662
00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:34.050
becomes more and more complicated.
And at some point you

663
00:31:34.050 --> 00:31:35.790
have to be a good
developer in the early days,

664
00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:37.700
you can get away with
some little dinky things and

665
00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:40.140
point being the flashlight app
was okay at some point.

666
00:31:40.490 --> 00:31:42.480
Right? And, and, and you
can actually, you can, you

667
00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:45.270
engrave, that's a good point
too. You can create the

668
00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:47.940
flashlight out though with new
projects and you're done and

669
00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:50.070
that's it, you've got a
flashlight app. So you could

670
00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:51.690
do that. But as you,
as you go along, not

671
00:31:51.690 --> 00:31:54.690
only is the functionality more
important, but performance is a

672
00:31:54.690 --> 00:31:56.130
big deal, right? So there,
there are people who are

673
00:31:56.130 --> 00:31:59.010
going to use a lot
of the builtin convenience of

674
00:31:59.010 --> 00:32:01.440
the whole view system to
build a table. For example,

675
00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:02.850
if you do that, you're
going to have a chunky,

676
00:32:02.850 --> 00:32:07.140
terribly scrolling table. That is
so it's not like it

677
00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:09.090
doesn't come out perfect. And
pretty right off the bat,

678
00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:10.920
right. You end up having
to bypass all that and

679
00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:13.320
go straight to the CAPC.
I juxtapose this to the

680
00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:16.380
time when I tried to
move my Palm pilot application,

681
00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:19.380
when the Palm pilot was
dying from C to C

682
00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:22.560
sharp on the little windows
mobile phone. And it took

683
00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:26.190
me like three days to
like put together a nice

684
00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:29.100
little blood sugar application grid,
detail. The problem was it

685
00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:32.700
was ugly. But from like
a productivity perspective, it was

686
00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:34.860
ridiculous. He had his string
type and everything. It was

687
00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:41.780
probably very exciting. Yeah. But
you know what I'm saying?

688
00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:43.790
It's just interesting that people
will work hard at something

689
00:32:43.790 --> 00:32:46.300
that looks pretty. Yes. But
they will not do the

690
00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:48.970
easy thing that looks ugly
when you, when you get

691
00:32:48.970 --> 00:32:51.460
into it though, like my
iPhone, when I go and

692
00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:54.100
I download an iPhone app,
I get so easily offended

693
00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:55.780
now because I know what
it takes. I know what

694
00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:57.340
it takes to build one
of these things. And I

695
00:32:57.340 --> 00:33:00.310
know what people are doing
and it horrifies me like

696
00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:05.050
you're angry at an application.
Yes. I'm angry at the

697
00:33:05.050 --> 00:33:06.790
app, but by proxy, I'm
angry at the person who

698
00:33:06.790 --> 00:33:10.750
made it. Okay. And I'm
angry at how lazy, you

699
00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:12.430
know, people are how little
research they do. Like there

700
00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:14.800
are all these guidelines to
make the apps usable, right.

701
00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:16.120
To make them look good,
to make them usable, to

702
00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:18.220
make them consistent from one
after the other. So you

703
00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:19.420
never need to have a
manual. And a lot of

704
00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:21.160
people don't need to bother
to read the most basic

705
00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:24.700
documents to make that happen.
And as a result, the

706
00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:28.840
app store is just packed
with garbage. Like almost everything

707
00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:31.270
in there is garbage. There's
a lot of them. Well,

708
00:33:31.270 --> 00:33:35.440
that's just because people are
writing unfunctional. It is like,

709
00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:38.860
SourceForge, it's a graveyard of
broken technical dreams. This is

710
00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:41.230
Scott, the Scott, not Scott,
the Microsoft guy. But yeah.

711
00:33:41.230 --> 00:33:43.000
I mean, the iPhone apps
are, is like, SourceForge where

712
00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.410
it's like, we've got 86,000
apps and 1% of them

713
00:33:47.410 --> 00:33:49.330
are interesting and you should
care about them. That's so

714
00:33:49.330 --> 00:33:51.660
much better than the one
that we used to have

715
00:33:51.670 --> 00:33:54.460
all is mobile. Where if
there were 86,000 apps, they

716
00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:55.600
were at, some of them
are good and some of

717
00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:57.310
them are bad and they
didn't even have consistent user

718
00:33:57.310 --> 00:34:00.070
interfaces. Well, they, and they
were on 86,000 different sites.

719
00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:04.720
Yeah. Yeah. You had to
go find it. And they

720
00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:06.190
were like, and then it
didn't work because it was

721
00:34:06.190 --> 00:34:07.690
missing a button and you
didn't have a button on

722
00:34:07.690 --> 00:34:10.420
your phone that you needed
to use this application, But,

723
00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:13.690
but, but mano, a mano
touch. Oh yeah. So, so

724
00:34:13.690 --> 00:34:15.370
mano touch, it's actually exciting
to me for almost the

725
00:34:15.370 --> 00:34:18.370
same reason that just objective
C development for the iPhone.

726
00:34:18.370 --> 00:34:21.550
Isn't that mano touch is
brand new. Right. And, and

727
00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:23.710
those guys are geniuses. Like,
I want to say that.

728
00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:27.940
I mean, they are seriously
freaky smart people, and it's

729
00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:30.610
a version one product that
does, you can write a

730
00:34:30.610 --> 00:34:32.680
pretty solid app with it.
There's some stuff that's missing.

731
00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:35.290
Right. But that's one of
my favorite parts. I mean,

732
00:34:35.290 --> 00:34:37.570
one of my favorite parts
is finding the bits of

733
00:34:37.570 --> 00:34:40.420
the cocoa touch framework that
they did not bind for

734
00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:42.970
monitoring and writing the bindings.
I don't know why I

735
00:34:42.970 --> 00:34:47.410
must be sick, but I
okay. So if you want

736
00:34:47.410 --> 00:34:51.070
to use a cocoa touch
type, like if there's, for

737
00:34:51.070 --> 00:34:54.460
example, the serialization bits in
cocoa, the, the, the libraries

738
00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:58.720
for the iPhone, they're very
different from any kind of

739
00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:01.720
Danette serialization. It isn't, it's
just like wrapping the windows

740
00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:03.760
API. Like there's some something
you want to call on

741
00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:06.550
the windows API. That's not
exposed into the.net framework. It's

742
00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:10.030
it's you have a wrapper.
It's almost like that, except

743
00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:14.020
that because you're dealing with
a completely, I mean, they've

744
00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:15.850
got to pass everything through
the objective C runtime, right?

745
00:35:15.850 --> 00:35:18.070
So they've got a wrapper
around the objective C runtime,

746
00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:19.810
and you've got a set
of attributes that they use

747
00:35:19.810 --> 00:35:23.680
to either export types to
the objectives, the runtime, or

748
00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:28.150
make objective C cocoa types
available to.net. Right. It's just

749
00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:32.050
fascinating. And there's some things
you just can't do right

750
00:35:32.050 --> 00:35:34.210
now. And that's one of
my favorite parts, right? And

751
00:35:34.210 --> 00:35:36.310
those guys are gonna, they're
gonna fix it. You get

752
00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:38.670
those guys two, three months,
and The model guys are

753
00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:40.770
gonna have everything, put it
over this going to be

754
00:35:40.770 --> 00:35:42.900
necessary. But right now, if
you really want to write

755
00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:44.700
an app, that's going to
be able to like save

756
00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:48.780
state properly, restore properly a
B performance. You're going to

757
00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:50.550
have to do some story
like writing for the Palm

758
00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:52.350
pilot again, where it's like,
you could be shut down

759
00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:55.220
at any point. But, but,
but, but it's, but it's

760
00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:57.440
not that it's not quite
that, right. Because the things

761
00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:59.750
that you can do, you
really do write half the

762
00:35:59.750 --> 00:36:02.210
code. Like Miguel loves to
talk about properties. And it's

763
00:36:02.210 --> 00:36:04.640
a great example because in
the objective C world, you

764
00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:06.620
have to write your local
in your head or file.

765
00:36:06.830 --> 00:36:09.470
Then you've got to write
the property, a declaration, that's

766
00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:12.200
going to represent it. And
then you've got to put

767
00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:16.220
the synthesized statement in the
implementation file. You're just talking,

768
00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:18.200
right? I mean, you're like,
you're translating stuff from English

769
00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:20.390
to Japanese and back into
English. And I have no

770
00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:25.670
idea what you're saying. <inaudible>,
it's a million steps. And

771
00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:28.280
just to hook it up
to a UI component that

772
00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:30.350
exists in interface, builder is
a whole extra set of

773
00:36:30.350 --> 00:36:32.630
steps with mano touch. You
want an interface builder, which

774
00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:35.630
is their UI designer. You
create your button or whatever

775
00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:38.480
it is, and you give
it, we'll just call it.

776
00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:39.700
You give it a name.
It's called an outlet, but

777
00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:41.840
we'll just say a name
and mano touch. As soon

778
00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:44.930
as you save that interface
file will generate a partial

779
00:36:44.930 --> 00:36:48.950
class that will make all
of those UI components available

780
00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:50.490
to use properties. And you
don't have to wire anything

781
00:36:50.490 --> 00:36:53.180
away. It's like wind forms
and how wind farms is

782
00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:56.420
really a very, very light
framework on top of wind

783
00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:59.390
32. It is, it's all
alive, but there's so many

784
00:36:59.390 --> 00:37:01.820
things that were hard and
went 32. They're just done

785
00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:04.580
for you. It's not, it's
not a lie that because

786
00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:07.610
cocoa touch, like you cannot
do things a doughnut way

787
00:37:07.610 --> 00:37:08.900
for the iPhone or else
we're going to be wrong.

788
00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:11.600
If you try to ride
like a.net app for the

789
00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:13.850
iPhone, you're going to screw
up like the point isn't

790
00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:16.070
to make it possible, to
write.net apps for the iPhone.

791
00:37:16.070 --> 00:37:18.140
It's to be able to
write iPhone apps using.net. Right.

792
00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:19.940
I don't know if that
makes sense, but string manipulation,

793
00:37:19.970 --> 00:37:23.390
data manipulation, all of that
is so much easier. You

794
00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:24.770
wonder when you, when you,
when you see something like

795
00:37:24.770 --> 00:37:26.750
that, and you must be
wondering if the people at

796
00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:29.390
Apple that engineered this stuff
have ever looked at any

797
00:37:29.390 --> 00:37:31.820
other programming frameworks, other than
the one they're using, because

798
00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:33.470
they haven't figured out some
of the stuff that was

799
00:37:33.470 --> 00:37:36.470
invented 20 years ago to
make programming easier. And it

800
00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:41.300
happens in the other direction
too. Of course. No, no,

801
00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:43.760
but it's really true. Okay.
I can understand if they

802
00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:45.440
said, look, we just, haven't
had time to fix up

803
00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:47.870
objective C and to add
to these following features. But

804
00:37:47.870 --> 00:37:49.790
some only 20 years, you
look at these, you look

805
00:37:49.790 --> 00:37:54.470
at these application frameworks and
this stuff is they, they

806
00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:58.250
don't even seem to be
aware that certain technologies have

807
00:37:58.250 --> 00:38:03.080
been invented in programming languages
in application frameworks. Things like,

808
00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:05.210
you know, this stuff is
starting to show up in

809
00:38:05.210 --> 00:38:07.670
C sharp. So C sharp
3.0 is classic certain things

810
00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:11.000
that are starting to shop
in. C-sharp like a little

811
00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.610
bit of type inference, which
was invented in probably, well,

812
00:38:13.610 --> 00:38:15.740
I was first learning about
it in college. So Haskell

813
00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:18.980
1988 or something, the idea
of type inference, which the

814
00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:20.300
only thing we're the only
place that showed up in

815
00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:22.610
C sharp is the VAR
statement. And then in first

816
00:38:22.610 --> 00:38:32.120
the type. So if you
have something that's a variant.

817
00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:37.210
Yeah. Okay. Okay. That's another
invention. It's a dish that

818
00:38:37.210 --> 00:38:40.270
I dispatch clients and I
call my dispatch, but I'm

819
00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:42.520
pretty good in Joel terms.
Okay. So it's a thing

820
00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:45.550
that can, it's a, it's
a variable in Joe's world.

821
00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:49.360
Okay. I'm sorry. I have
to go back to 10

822
00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:54.130
years because I haven't paid
attention. It's a virus. A

823
00:38:54.130 --> 00:38:59.050
virus compile time. Correct. Okay.
Totally understood. So VAR is

824
00:38:59.050 --> 00:39:02.260
a feature called type inference
with a compiler, actually figures

825
00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:05.530
out what types of things,
tactics, sugar, and syntactic sugar.

826
00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:09.040
And it's only partially implemented
in C sharp, for example,

827
00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:10.210
can you do it? Can
you can't use it for

828
00:39:10.210 --> 00:39:14.290
a parameter. Okay. That's not
there yet, but there are

829
00:39:14.290 --> 00:39:16.720
programming languages such as Haskell
and ML. How would you

830
00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:19.330
use it for parameter? You
would say far X, how

831
00:39:19.330 --> 00:39:21.010
would you know how someone
was going to call you?

832
00:39:21.010 --> 00:39:22.780
Two guys could call you
differently. Only one of them

833
00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:24.550
would work because you decided
to code, you would be

834
00:39:24.550 --> 00:39:26.950
saying X equals 12. And
it would know that it's

835
00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:29.110
an ENT, or you would
be saying print FX. And

836
00:39:29.110 --> 00:39:30.700
it would know that it's
a string. You couldn't know

837
00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:32.830
that because two people would
call you from two different

838
00:39:32.830 --> 00:39:35.170
places. The one who gets
mad, it's not, who's calling

839
00:39:35.170 --> 00:39:37.030
you. It's what you're doing
with the variable. And you're

840
00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:39.640
using that variable in places.
And it turns out that

841
00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:41.770
you can deduce what type
of thing is supposed to

842
00:39:41.770 --> 00:39:45.130
be. And if this sounds
bizarre to you, a go

843
00:39:45.130 --> 00:39:47.050
look at Haskell or ML,
there are languages that do

844
00:39:47.050 --> 00:39:49.900
this completely, a hundred percent
tech type inference. And B,

845
00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:52.260
we got wasabi, which is
a language that some idiot

846
00:39:52.330 --> 00:39:54.820
profile, no, sorry. This is
some kid at fog Creek

847
00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:58.510
software, right? I don't know
what I'm going to have.

848
00:39:58.510 --> 00:40:00.400
Andrews is going to call
you now. And you're going

849
00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:02.980
to arm wrestle. Does Andrew
say you can't do type

850
00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:05.920
in, for instance, he not.
I'm not saying you can

851
00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:08.110
or can't do. I'm just
saying here as a layman,

852
00:40:08.110 --> 00:40:11.110
as a non compiler designer,
as a person who doesn't

853
00:40:11.110 --> 00:40:14.890
own a multimillion dollar company
in New York, I'm just trying

854
00:40:14.890 --> 00:40:19.360
to think about the logistics
of parameter inference. Okay. So

855
00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:22.600
you get a parameter. It
says, bar X, what do

856
00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:24.760
you do with X? You
could call another function, right?

857
00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:28.510
Maybe I return X, maybe
I X plus plus a

858
00:40:28.570 --> 00:40:31.450
X plus pluses in a
day plus plus plus plus

859
00:40:33.010 --> 00:40:37.090
as an operator, I could
have overdone operator overloading. Ah,

860
00:40:37.110 --> 00:40:38.800
that's a good question. Okay.
Well, I don't know if

861
00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:40.750
ASCO has that porno letting
it. And sometimes it's true

862
00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:43.240
that sometimes these languages, like
if you look at Oh,

863
00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:47.080
camel, it's very bizarre in
that there is talking to

864
00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:49.590
you. It's like talking to
a college professor. Hold on,

865
00:40:49.590 --> 00:40:52.230
hold on. I think, I
think, I mean, maybe because

866
00:40:52.530 --> 00:40:54.540
I'm sorta dumb, so it
might help for me to

867
00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:57.480
give the numbers. You may
find when the listeners hear

868
00:40:57.480 --> 00:40:59.130
this show that we're all
doing, You just look at

869
00:40:59.130 --> 00:41:01.650
how somebody's calling the function,
right. And you can figure

870
00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:04.080
out from that, what kind
of data is being passed

871
00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:05.460
in, right? And either it's
going to work or it's

872
00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:08.160
not. And that's, let me,
let me tell you, the

873
00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:11.910
wasabi programming language developed at
fog Creek is VB script

874
00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:15.720
where nothing is, things are
totally bummed. They don't have

875
00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:18.930
to be, and it does
full type inference. So it

876
00:41:18.930 --> 00:41:21.780
is possible. And BB script
like languages, why doesn't it

877
00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:24.930
compile more into more than
one application? It, well, that's

878
00:41:24.930 --> 00:41:27.450
just cause we didn't bother
implementing all this little specific

879
00:41:27.450 --> 00:41:29.550
language. Joel was just way
ahead of his time. Domain

880
00:41:29.550 --> 00:41:33.060
specific language that compiles into
one application, it was given

881
00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:34.910
to the lab. Why don't
you give it to the

882
00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:41.140
world? Ah, because it sucks.
Well, you heard it here

883
00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:44.320
first. Good night, everybody tip
your waiter. That's the best.

884
00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:46.120
I've you know, any podcasts
I've done with Joel? That's

885
00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:48.220
the single best thing he's
ever said. And I love

886
00:41:48.220 --> 00:41:51.400
it. That has to be
published somewhere. T shirts made

887
00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:54.160
me, it sucks. Exactly. You
shouldn't be wearing it. You

888
00:41:54.310 --> 00:41:56.860
had to invent a language
whose only goal of this

889
00:41:56.860 --> 00:41:59.140
language was to compile the
source code that you already

890
00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:02.350
had. You wouldn't bother implementing
all kinds of useful language

891
00:42:02.350 --> 00:42:05.080
features. We've done this before.
I'm with you brother. I'm

892
00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:07.750
with you. Here's the thing.
I know why you wrote

893
00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:11.020
wasabi and I agree and
I'm with you, but to

894
00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:14.440
then declare it a surprise.
Your, your general purpose language

895
00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:18.160
is a bit of a
stretch. Try compiling Fritz as

896
00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:23.110
possible. Try compiling. It is
an existence proof of type

897
00:42:23.110 --> 00:42:26.680
inference. It proves that you
can infer types. Okay. To

898
00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:28.690
be clear. Yeah. We're not
talking about it. I think

899
00:42:28.990 --> 00:42:31.300
everyone understands. You can do
type inference. Yeah. I was

900
00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:33.880
just saying I had to
do it with a parameter.

901
00:42:33.970 --> 00:42:35.860
I just said with parameters,
it might require a little

902
00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:39.400
more thought. That's sense between
calling a function with a

903
00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:43.960
parameter and assigning to a
variable because you can call

904
00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:47.530
it. I can passion because
I could call Fu with

905
00:42:47.530 --> 00:42:51.040
a string and Fu with
a food, with another variable

906
00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:54.070
called a and Fu with
a number three different times

907
00:42:54.070 --> 00:42:55.690
and the same application you're
going to have to generate

908
00:42:55.690 --> 00:42:57.580
three D. If that's going
to ever be tightly back

909
00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:00.760
to put a stop to
the armchair language, You can't

910
00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:03.880
be doing that because that's
a type error he's describing.

911
00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:09.730
He's describing generics. He's completely.
You're delusional. You're delusional. No,

912
00:43:09.730 --> 00:43:12.520
no, no, no. You're not
going to finish it. No.

913
00:43:12.730 --> 00:43:15.640
All right. So here's the
deal, right? You got, that

914
00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:17.860
is a type error. Let's
you and I talk here.

915
00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:20.230
This is fact Scott, if
you call the same function

916
00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:22.060
once with an H went
to the string, that is

917
00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:24.880
a type error, right? Aha
type inference. Doesn't mean you

918
00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:27.610
can't ever have type errors.
The type inference says type

919
00:43:27.610 --> 00:43:30.580
error. The type infer can
say you have a type

920
00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:32.620
error. Well, hold on. You
just blow stuff up at

921
00:43:32.620 --> 00:43:37.060
runtime. Well, no, I think
objective to see where you

922
00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:38.350
can blow stuff up at
runtime where you can just

923
00:43:38.350 --> 00:43:40.120
pass anything and he wants
it. We have got to

924
00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:43.540
stop. This Is Joel jolt
with all due respect. Joel,

925
00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:46.060
Joe, we're 50 minutes into
this and I'm just telling

926
00:43:46.060 --> 00:43:47.530
you, the comments are not
going to go well for

927
00:43:47.530 --> 00:43:49.300
you on this one. That's
because you're not letting me

928
00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:53.200
explain. Alright, well actually I
have a segue because I

929
00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:56.260
was intrigued. I do know
I have a segue in

930
00:43:56.260 --> 00:43:59.740
the other sense of the
word. You said you, thank

931
00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:02.530
you. I mispronounced it as
usual a you, I would

932
00:44:02.530 --> 00:44:05.200
like to say you into
a different topic. So you,

933
00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:09.100
you showed, you showed to
us visual studio 2010 beta

934
00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:12.280
two, which just came out.
It's true. Yes. And I

935
00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:14.170
was actually, although, you know,
I do not. I try

936
00:44:14.170 --> 00:44:16.510
to avoid the new and
shiny the bang PI developer

937
00:44:16.510 --> 00:44:18.970
problem. I'm gonna say the
shininess was very attractive to

938
00:44:18.970 --> 00:44:22.240
me that got you. It
was the non rectangular splash

939
00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:24.730
train. First of all, <inaudible>
let me just let that

940
00:44:24.730 --> 00:44:29.230
sink in non rectangular spot
spot. Yeah, exactly, exactly. So

941
00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:30.850
I thought maybe you could
go over just a few

942
00:44:30.850 --> 00:44:32.490
of the highlights in terms
of like what's Coming. Cause

943
00:44:32.490 --> 00:44:34.050
I haven't, haven't really had
time to look at it,

944
00:44:34.050 --> 00:44:36.810
but no, I haven't at
all. So are you setting

945
00:44:36.810 --> 00:44:38.570
me up to be a
shill? I know. I just

946
00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:43.310
honestly want to know. It
doesn't have type in for

947
00:44:43.310 --> 00:44:47.480
instance, parameter types. Cause it's
Passing a parameter Assignment. If

948
00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:48.950
you could do it with
assignment, you can do it

949
00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:51.740
parameters. I will tell you
a few things and then

950
00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:56.690
Joel will tell us when
they were demented. I will

951
00:44:56.690 --> 00:44:59.330
then I'll just tell you.
And then Joel say 1904

952
00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:07.450
and I was there. Okay.
Okay. Just so much. Okay.

953
00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:12.890
What do you care about
asp.net? Obviously MVC core language

954
00:45:12.890 --> 00:45:15.260
stuff. Like C-sharp 4.0, this
is like a real runtime

955
00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:17.960
change. This is the side
by side runtime, which means

956
00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:20.450
that it's not a fake,
there was never a fake

957
00:45:20.450 --> 00:45:25.460
runtime. There were fake runtime.
There've been four runtime, One

958
00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:30.560
Oh one, one, two And
four. Yes. So we're actually

959
00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:32.030
getting a new runtime. So
you're getting a new side

960
00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:37.880
by side 3.0 and 3.5.
You can put me up.

961
00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:40.220
You can put four O
on a machine with two

962
00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:42.380
Oh and three and three,
five. And it will keep

963
00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:44.750
running as before. Nice. You
can have a machine, like

964
00:45:44.750 --> 00:45:47.900
a windows server machine that
has different virtual directories and

965
00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:52.040
runs one, one, two Oh
three, five, four, Oh all

966
00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:53.930
on the same machine and
they'll they won't break it

967
00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:56.270
installing four. Oh, it won't
break your three, five app.

968
00:45:56.330 --> 00:45:57.470
Right? Right. So let me
just go off the top

969
00:45:57.470 --> 00:45:59.210
of my head. So at
1.0, was okay. Initial release

970
00:45:59.210 --> 00:46:03.680
of.net. 1.1 was the non
broken version finally, right? 2.0

971
00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:06.140
actually added generics. I'm just
listening to highlights later. Yeah.

972
00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:08.990
Three. Oh, I think was
link. No, that was WTF.

973
00:46:08.990 --> 00:46:12.740
Three, five was link. Wasn't
it? Yeah. Three Oh was

974
00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:16.850
an extension was WPF. W
a CF. So my point

975
00:46:16.850 --> 00:46:19.340
is there's a few Highline
features the big stuff. The

976
00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:21.710
big marketing stuff. Give me
the big 4.0, sell, like

977
00:46:21.740 --> 00:46:24.650
make me believe. Make you
believe. Make me believe again

978
00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:27.920
that I can fly. Well,
NBC two ships out of

979
00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:31.910
the box, right? jQuery ships
with asp.net. What? Regular. These

980
00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:35.060
are not language. He thinks
language. Okay. Dynamic the DLR

981
00:46:35.060 --> 00:46:38.090
ships. Okay. Okay. So that
means you've got iron Python,

982
00:46:38.090 --> 00:46:41.720
iron, Ruby. You've got also
calm better combining. So if

983
00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:43.940
you're going to call CommonWell,
so wait, iron Python and

984
00:46:43.950 --> 00:46:46.010
Ruby are going to ship
like parallel with four point.

985
00:46:46.010 --> 00:46:47.480
Oh. Or is that going
to yeah, they'll they'll they'll

986
00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:48.800
probably be out of band.
I'm not sure. I'd have

987
00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:50.600
to ask those guys what
the DLR is in the

988
00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:52.460
box. Oh, nice. So that's
so that means that you

989
00:46:52.460 --> 00:46:55.710
could go and you could
say, you know, a VAR

990
00:46:56.090 --> 00:47:00.920
VAR, you could say, you
know, VAR P equals Python,

991
00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:03.920
I'll create runtime and then
give it a whatever.py and

992
00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:06.170
then call it. You get
me? I can say no,

993
00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:08.030
actually wouldn't say VAR or
you take dynamic rather. Excuse

994
00:47:08.030 --> 00:47:10.190
me. It's tell me on
the code simplification. Because to

995
00:47:10.190 --> 00:47:11.960
me, one of the smart
things about not net was

996
00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:13.280
it sort of got rid
of some of the cruft,

997
00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:15.200
like as I went from
2.0 to three Oh three,

998
00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:17.600
five, I could use the
VAR key word. I could

999
00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:21.410
use generics, these guys property
stuff. Right? Property shattered, getter

1000
00:47:21.410 --> 00:47:24.650
setter. Automatic. It's just one
line now. Sure. Right. So

1001
00:47:24.650 --> 00:47:26.210
yeah, there are things that
made my life. You could

1002
00:47:26.210 --> 00:47:30.100
have name parameters, parameters. That's
cool. When you're calling calm,

1003
00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:31.810
you don't have to keep
saying missing comma missing. Come

1004
00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:34.420
missing. Yeah. You have named
that's a good one. Yeah.

1005
00:47:34.510 --> 00:47:35.830
Is that a comment? I
wanted to say, first of

1006
00:47:35.830 --> 00:47:40.060
all, that I got comments
after today's talk where I

1007
00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:42.760
was told that one of
the most exciting parts was

1008
00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:45.160
where I showed the difference
between doing properties in objective

1009
00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:48.100
C and in C-sharp. Right.
Instead of having to do

1010
00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:51.400
it in the 5 million lineups
and no, it was, and

1011
00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:53.350
I liked, I got to
make it clear too. I

1012
00:47:53.350 --> 00:47:54.940
just wanted to cause I
like objective C and I

1013
00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:57.490
like developing for the iPhone
Apple guys. I'm sorry. I

1014
00:47:57.490 --> 00:48:00.850
like the stuff, but C-sharp
getting to do all that

1015
00:48:00.850 --> 00:48:02.830
stuff on one line, get
my whole, just get everything

1016
00:48:02.830 --> 00:48:06.340
done there. It was amazing.
And people were genuinely really

1017
00:48:06.340 --> 00:48:08.560
excited about getting to do
that for the iPhone. Right.

1018
00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:10.690
And in fact, I'm sorry,
can we go back to

1019
00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:12.940
something in a little while?
At least the Joel brought

1020
00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:14.890
up, it's been a while
since I've done any windows

1021
00:48:14.890 --> 00:48:18.790
development. Now, why would I
get so excited about, would

1022
00:48:18.790 --> 00:48:21.010
you say like better calm
something or other, I mean,

1023
00:48:21.010 --> 00:48:23.260
is this real? So here's
the thing. This is, I

1024
00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:25.060
like to call it. This
is Scott talking, not Microsoft

1025
00:48:25.060 --> 00:48:26.770
talking. I like to think
of it as a customer

1026
00:48:26.770 --> 00:48:29.980
pain release. There's a whole
bunch of stuff that people

1027
00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:32.830
were hurting about. Not necessarily
stuff that you Rory care

1028
00:48:32.830 --> 00:48:36.610
about, but people who are
automating doing business problems, automating

1029
00:48:36.610 --> 00:48:39.130
word and Excel on the,
you know, they're trying to

1030
00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:44.230
get it done would, would
be pretty excited about how

1031
00:48:44.230 --> 00:48:46.840
using the DLR and the
combiner to make things easier.

1032
00:48:47.110 --> 00:48:49.330
Right now name parameters is
huge because once you have,

1033
00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:51.220
I mean, if you try
to avoid having functions like

1034
00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:56.380
seven parameters, that will be
extreme, right? 47 grammar. Yeah.

1035
00:48:56.940 --> 00:48:58.770
Yeah. So another example on
the comp side is the

1036
00:48:58.770 --> 00:49:03.270
ability to do a type
inference with a dynamic, which

1037
00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:06.660
is you can have like
a Pia primary interrupt assembly

1038
00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:09.450
and you like reference a
word interrupt assembly. And that

1039
00:49:09.450 --> 00:49:11.220
would ordinarily be like a
20 Meg file. You have

1040
00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:13.380
to carry around. Now you
can just say embed inter-op

1041
00:49:13.390 --> 00:49:15.750
assemblies. And it'll look at
the types that you use

1042
00:49:15.750 --> 00:49:17.550
and then just embed the
ones that you need. And

1043
00:49:17.550 --> 00:49:20.400
then it runtime later, it'll
say, Oh, well, these types

1044
00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:22.200
that he has embedded are
the same ones that are

1045
00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:24.210
installed in the machine. You
don't have to ship the

1046
00:49:24.210 --> 00:49:26.910
PIs and it makes your
application smaller. Right. And you

1047
00:49:26.910 --> 00:49:29.790
also mentioned there's a dynamic
keyword was a dynamic keyword.

1048
00:49:29.790 --> 00:49:32.670
So you know how you
could do make calls with

1049
00:49:32.670 --> 00:49:34.950
reflection now. Right. You could
go and you know, I

1050
00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:37.530
see you, you could do
reflection and reflection was so

1051
00:49:37.530 --> 00:49:39.640
painful, but it's not painful
anymore. Cause there's a, there's

1052
00:49:39.660 --> 00:49:42.300
a, Oh, so you could
actually take dynamic, you know,

1053
00:49:42.330 --> 00:49:45.630
a equals and then wander
around the ABI. You could

1054
00:49:45.630 --> 00:49:48.960
take calc dot add. Oh.
And even though it doesn't,

1055
00:49:48.990 --> 00:49:50.910
you know, you don't know
until runtime, if it has

1056
00:49:50.910 --> 00:49:55.410
the add method, it's the
equivalent of a, you know,

1057
00:49:55.420 --> 00:49:58.740
calc equals new calculator and
then a dot add and

1058
00:49:58.740 --> 00:50:00.660
then suddenly you, yeah. Yeah.
But this means this part

1059
00:50:00.660 --> 00:50:02.550
of the base framework. This
is an ILD. You can

1060
00:50:02.550 --> 00:50:05.430
use this in wasabi though.
Here we are fighting to

1061
00:50:05.430 --> 00:50:07.640
get back things they were
in now, literally tell next

1062
00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:10.380
to the objective C guys,
they haven't even gotten there

1063
00:50:12.150 --> 00:50:16.310
so long. You taught me
of the objectives. So what's

1064
00:50:16.310 --> 00:50:18.210
so what's cool about it
Is that you get, you

1065
00:50:18.210 --> 00:50:20.400
get binders, you get Python,
you get Ruby, you get

1066
00:50:20.430 --> 00:50:23.820
calm, you get dotnet. So
stuff that you were doing

1067
00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:26.280
that was like meta programming
type stuff and like code,

1068
00:50:26.340 --> 00:50:29.300
you know, any time that
you were well, anytime you

1069
00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:32.780
want basically call site dispatching,
dynamic, dispatch of methods and

1070
00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:35.120
all the framework underneath it
to make it fast. That's

1071
00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:37.030
all included on the box.
Actually, all I need to

1072
00:50:37.030 --> 00:50:39.460
hear the money line for
me is it makes reflection

1073
00:50:39.460 --> 00:50:43.630
not painful. Oh, I'm making
an app scriptable you can

1074
00:50:43.630 --> 00:50:45.190
take any app and then
just tell I'm going to

1075
00:50:45.190 --> 00:50:47.770
expose these objects. And now,
now I can drop in

1076
00:50:47.770 --> 00:50:50.530
Python. And the app is
scriptable. Yeah. I'm going to

1077
00:50:50.530 --> 00:50:54.220
make baby smash Python addition
basically. And like kids could

1078
00:50:54.220 --> 00:50:56.710
write their own apps using
the baby smash framework or

1079
00:50:56.710 --> 00:50:58.390
whatever. It might be a
sort of steep learning curve

1080
00:50:58.660 --> 00:51:01.090
to the regular babies user.
Right. For infants. I think

1081
00:51:01.090 --> 00:51:03.160
it may be a struggle,
but not for rock-hard awesome.

1082
00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:06.460
Of course. No. He's way
ahead of his time. It's

1083
00:51:06.460 --> 00:51:09.130
true. So, w what's the
ETA roughly on like for

1084
00:51:09.130 --> 00:51:13.180
Panella being available? Like for
real, I'm not sure. I

1085
00:51:13.180 --> 00:51:16.540
mean, they, I saw online
something about next March, but

1086
00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:18.250
I don't know. I'd have
to check sometime next year

1087
00:51:18.250 --> 00:51:21.040
then probably sooner than later
sooner. No, no I'm saying

1088
00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:24.100
that. I honestly don't know.
I read on Twitter. Someone

1089
00:51:24.100 --> 00:51:26.290
said next March, but I'd
have to go and check

1090
00:51:26.650 --> 00:51:28.810
beta two came out now.
So that would be six

1091
00:51:28.810 --> 00:51:30.610
months from now. Well, what
about, okay, so that was

1092
00:51:30.610 --> 00:51:32.170
the language, which I think
is the core thing. That's

1093
00:51:32.170 --> 00:51:34.120
interesting. But what about, what
about the IDE? Because I

1094
00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:36.250
think, Oh yeah. So the
IDE like most of the

1095
00:51:36.250 --> 00:51:38.800
IDs using WPF now, which
means that you can write

1096
00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:42.010
plugins for the IDE in
managed code. They had a

1097
00:51:42.010 --> 00:51:45.220
nice icon. I just wanna
point that out, But yeah,

1098
00:51:45.220 --> 00:51:46.810
I'm looking forward to the
ID, improving one thing like

1099
00:51:46.810 --> 00:51:50.110
multimillionaire, There's an app store
for IDE extensions really. Or

1100
00:51:50.110 --> 00:51:52.510
you can go tools, extension
manager, and you can download

1101
00:51:52.510 --> 00:51:54.820
dynamically. So check this out
and pay for it and

1102
00:51:54.820 --> 00:51:56.290
all that stuff. I don't
think about the pay for

1103
00:51:56.290 --> 00:51:59.560
it part because it's like,
it's like a store, but

1104
00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:02.440
it's like a store where
everything's free. So there's an

1105
00:52:02.440 --> 00:52:04.930
extension estimate store. So there
was this there's this demo

1106
00:52:04.930 --> 00:52:08.080
that we did internally, where
I'm at, there's an internal

1107
00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:09.670
conference. We have, it's kind
of like a mini ticket

1108
00:52:10.090 --> 00:52:12.910
and the only member of
the Songsmith thing we like.

1109
00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:16.960
So this guy wrote an
extension, that embedded song, so

1110
00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:19.900
you can sing your comments.
And it was, it was

1111
00:52:19.900 --> 00:52:22.540
an example of, it was
pretty crazy, stupid, but awesome.

1112
00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:27.460
But the point was that
to see it was exactly

1113
00:52:27.460 --> 00:52:29.470
what we did and what
he did was he put

1114
00:52:29.470 --> 00:52:32.650
in some comments and in
the markup for the comments

1115
00:52:34.030 --> 00:52:40.030
Dragons here, It's like Sondheim
on Sondheim with, with type

1116
00:52:40.030 --> 00:52:44.500
inference. You could put in
some markup inside of your,

1117
00:52:45.670 --> 00:52:48.100
your comments and then key
off of that. And then

1118
00:52:48.100 --> 00:52:52.090
literally drop, he dropped the
Songsmith component into the editor

1119
00:52:52.090 --> 00:52:54.400
itself. So the point is
you can interact with the

1120
00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:55.930
editor in a way that
you could never do before.

1121
00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:58.270
So it's much more extensible.
Oh yeah. And you have

1122
00:52:58.270 --> 00:53:02.050
multi-monitor support. That's been the
whole thing now. Right? Like

1123
00:53:02.050 --> 00:53:03.880
give me like the top
three things that you notice

1124
00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:07.660
When I saw you get
into it. Yeah. WPF apps

1125
00:53:07.690 --> 00:53:11.710
typically have a, have a
bad reputation of being blurry.

1126
00:53:12.220 --> 00:53:15.220
That's totally fixed. And the
speed of WPF is really

1127
00:53:15.220 --> 00:53:19.540
fast. So w visual studio
2010 is written mostly in

1128
00:53:19.540 --> 00:53:21.670
WPF now, but it's as
fast as it was in

1129
00:53:21.670 --> 00:53:24.550
2008. So it just looks
better. It just looks better.

1130
00:53:24.580 --> 00:53:27.240
It looked good. You get
like controls, crawl support in

1131
00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:30.090
your, so you can like
zoom in and out of

1132
00:53:30.090 --> 00:53:33.990
your code. Yeah. Yeah. It's
I mean, it's pretty cool.

1133
00:53:34.350 --> 00:53:36.930
Very great. Pretty cool. There's
a whole new redesign new

1134
00:53:36.930 --> 00:53:39.840
project dialogue box to in
my world for the past

1135
00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:43.070
year, I've had a color
coded. Oh. And the, the

1136
00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:45.720
ad referenced dialogue is multi-threaded
now, now that was the

1137
00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:48.570
big deal for me was
getting code completion that mostly

1138
00:53:48.570 --> 00:53:51.810
worked. We just got refactor
for some things. Okay. So,

1139
00:53:51.950 --> 00:53:53.820
so you guys are like,
Oh, it's pretty cool. You

1140
00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:56.610
know, but I mean, seriously,
like when I, when I

1141
00:53:56.610 --> 00:54:01.350
see visual studio, like 2003,
I get jealous. Right. I

1142
00:54:01.350 --> 00:54:03.540
mean, it's a totally different
where you get the ID

1143
00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:06.210
thing down. Pretty solid. It's
it's it's nice. It's nice.

1144
00:54:06.330 --> 00:54:09.840
Oh, Oh, the other thing
done it for the bootstrapper

1145
00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:11.670
for done at four it's
like, was it like 80%

1146
00:54:11.670 --> 00:54:14.790
smaller than before you can
start installing Dutton at four,

1147
00:54:14.790 --> 00:54:18.300
put downloading a, was it
less than one Meg? So

1148
00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:21.900
it's like a 1.8 Meg
bootstrapper and it comes down

1149
00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:23.820
to there's a client profile.
If you're only going to

1150
00:54:23.820 --> 00:54:26.190
install a client app and
then there's a server profile.

1151
00:54:26.190 --> 00:54:28.410
So if you're going to
install a, you know, I

1152
00:54:28.410 --> 00:54:31.890
don't know the rory.net application,
it's not going to install

1153
00:54:31.890 --> 00:54:35.460
asp.net on the person's machine.
Cause it's not needed. Did

1154
00:54:35.460 --> 00:54:37.650
I hear you say the
compilation is finally multithreaded for

1155
00:54:37.650 --> 00:54:40.260
like, actually this is something
I learned actually on the

1156
00:54:40.260 --> 00:54:44.280
seaside compilation is just very
easy to multithread. But on

1157
00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:46.410
the compilation where you can
come, you can do military

1158
00:54:46.410 --> 00:54:50.130
compilation now in three, five
kind of ms. Build slash

1159
00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:52.010
M and you put the
number of projects. Yeah. But

1160
00:54:52.010 --> 00:54:54.350
it doesn't really scale. Whereas
the C stuff like <inaudible>,

1161
00:54:54.380 --> 00:54:55.490
What's that out of your
ass? What are you talking

1162
00:54:55.490 --> 00:54:59.270
about? I've written articles about
this. I know, but I'm

1163
00:54:59.270 --> 00:55:00.890
just saying, so they fixed
that. So now out of

1164
00:55:00.890 --> 00:55:02.840
the box, I don't know
what has been fixed about

1165
00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:05.360
multi-threaded compiling other than the
fact that I've been doing

1166
00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:06.800
it for years. Well, cause
when I posted it on

1167
00:55:06.830 --> 00:55:08.470
my blog, all the C
programs can know that we

1168
00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:10.340
were working like, ah, we're
gonna Lynch you because you

1169
00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:15.110
know, Spilled support multi-pronged for
a long time. Yeah. It

1170
00:55:15.110 --> 00:55:17.660
really has her saying, Oh,
but speaking of, But wait

1171
00:55:17.660 --> 00:55:20.180
on the seaside, you own
a funeral. It Linearly like

1172
00:55:20.210 --> 00:55:22.340
perfectly. Well, that would be
great if you, if you

1173
00:55:22.340 --> 00:55:25.460
knew how to code C.
Well, I don't code C,

1174
00:55:25.460 --> 00:55:26.630
but that was my point.
It's like, I would like

1175
00:55:26.630 --> 00:55:28.430
to, I just, I always
feel the need to give,

1176
00:55:28.700 --> 00:55:31.520
to give a Jeff crap
about never learning, see 10

1177
00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:33.230
times as much good. Do
the same thing and see

1178
00:55:34.820 --> 00:55:37.640
it should be great because
it scales linearly. Well, I

1179
00:55:37.650 --> 00:55:39.800
got a whole caveat around
my recommendation. I was like,

1180
00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:41.900
okay, I really need quad
core. Unless you're a C

1181
00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:45.380
program, then you really need
it. But seriously, about on

1182
00:55:45.380 --> 00:55:48.890
the core stuff, the parallel
framework extensions is a huge,

1183
00:55:48.890 --> 00:55:51.500
huge parking now. Oh, that's
in four point it's built

1184
00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:53.030
in. It's built in. So
that means if you have

1185
00:55:53.030 --> 00:55:54.620
like a four loop or
you're doing like some link

1186
00:55:54.650 --> 00:55:55.670
and you just want to
say, ah, you know, I

1187
00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:58.220
wish I could do this
across multiple processors. You just

1188
00:55:58.220 --> 00:56:00.290
say parallel dot four. And
then you just for each

1189
00:56:00.290 --> 00:56:02.570
over stuff, or if you
want to do link, that's

1190
00:56:02.570 --> 00:56:04.580
like a big link query
over a huge dataset. You

1191
00:56:04.580 --> 00:56:10.910
could say, you know, from
FN, whatever.as parallel dot with

1192
00:56:10.910 --> 00:56:14.360
degrees of parallelism and then
pick the number of processes

1193
00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:15.950
you want to use. So
then you can take any,

1194
00:56:16.280 --> 00:56:19.100
any big enumeration or I
query we'll enter anything over

1195
00:56:19.100 --> 00:56:21.050
a large list and then
do it on multiple products.

1196
00:56:21.650 --> 00:56:23.620
And then there's also gateway
you like, did you do

1197
00:56:23.620 --> 00:56:25.570
that too? I had this
thing, this language, there was

1198
00:56:25.570 --> 00:56:29.200
a line. Joel is the
star, which is walking right

1199
00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:30.940
now. What the heck were
those machines that I had

1200
00:56:30.940 --> 00:56:34.810
in college? The parallel, super,
super parallel trays. It was

1201
00:56:34.810 --> 00:56:37.540
after the Cray, after the
Craig concurrent, it was a

1202
00:56:37.550 --> 00:56:40.180
thing we should, maybe there's
a thinking machine STEM connection

1203
00:56:40.180 --> 00:56:42.310
between it's called the connection
and actually machine. It just

1204
00:56:42.310 --> 00:56:44.650
had buckets and buckets about
buckets of 83, 86 chips.

1205
00:56:45.130 --> 00:56:46.960
And there was a language
for it called Seastar. There's

1206
00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:50.230
another language called Fortran star.
And you could run C

1207
00:56:50.230 --> 00:56:55.330
code, unfortunately code and a
and C code that it

1208
00:56:55.330 --> 00:56:57.820
would just automatically massively palatalized
for you just by adding

1209
00:56:57.820 --> 00:57:00.820
a little stars in various
magical places. It would cause

1210
00:57:00.850 --> 00:57:05.320
you to loops to run
in parallel automatically. Erline isn't

1211
00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:06.820
that the language does you're
right now that people are

1212
00:57:06.820 --> 00:57:09.160
talking about that does that
actually it's like designed for

1213
00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:11.920
parallelism. It's extremely well in
those days. And this may

1214
00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:14.290
still be the case. It's
extremely, sometimes it really doesn't

1215
00:57:14.290 --> 00:57:15.790
help because you think, all
right, I got this big

1216
00:57:15.790 --> 00:57:18.880
array of just the cost
of moving the data to

1217
00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:21.700
all these different CPS or
do this different cores is

1218
00:57:21.700 --> 00:57:23.950
actually higher than the amount
of time it was depressing

1219
00:57:23.950 --> 00:57:26.260
yourself. We added a bunch
of new visualization tools now

1220
00:57:26.260 --> 00:57:28.660
where you can see all
the threads, what they're doing,

1221
00:57:28.990 --> 00:57:31.690
what they're blocked on, why
they're blocked. Oh, Ooh, historical

1222
00:57:31.690 --> 00:57:40.270
debugging. Just like TiVo for
your debugging. <inaudible> but historically

1223
00:57:40.270 --> 00:57:42.820
booking, you can actually back
up and the debugger for

1224
00:57:42.820 --> 00:57:44.600
threatening when the whole, no,
but I'm just saying you

1225
00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:46.390
can go forward and you
can go backwards and I'm

1226
00:57:46.390 --> 00:57:48.580
not, I can say drop
it. It's wait a minute.

1227
00:57:49.030 --> 00:57:50.680
What do you like that
to step, step, step in

1228
00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:53.440
the back. And then you
can also go and say,

1229
00:57:53.590 --> 00:57:55.510
well, I want to take
this Intel a trace file.

1230
00:57:55.510 --> 00:57:57.420
And then I want to
give it, I want it

1231
00:57:57.440 --> 00:57:58.630
to tell the trace is
cool. Cause you can then

1232
00:57:58.630 --> 00:58:00.460
wrap it up and then
give it to somebody else.

1233
00:58:00.460 --> 00:58:02.680
Like, like, like remember the
replay TV used to do

1234
00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:05.710
that. And you can say
here, figure this out. So

1235
00:58:05.710 --> 00:58:07.210
rather than having someone to
dump, you had them in

1236
00:58:07.210 --> 00:58:09.610
Intel, a trace. Awesome. And
then they just keep debugging

1237
00:58:09.610 --> 00:58:14.370
from where you left off.
Nice transition point. So where

1238
00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:16.200
we're going to wrap it
up. But real briefly, I

1239
00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:18.720
want to tie into the
Apple world. Like what I

1240
00:58:18.720 --> 00:58:22.080
know they're very secretive, which
is, well, I'm just saying,

1241
00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:23.490
cause I'm curious, like where
are they going? Like with

1242
00:58:23.490 --> 00:58:25.620
Microsoft, one of nice things
is they're almost too open,

1243
00:58:25.890 --> 00:58:28.230
like 2010. We know what's
happening and blah, blah, blah.

1244
00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:30.210
So like what's next for
iPhone? Like, are they gonna

1245
00:58:30.220 --> 00:58:33.260
improve the environment? Are they
gonna do garbage collection? Well,

1246
00:58:33.270 --> 00:58:35.220
garbage collection already exists in
objective C too. I would

1247
00:58:35.220 --> 00:58:37.950
just not on the phone
for some reason. As far

1248
00:58:37.950 --> 00:58:41.550
as where they're gonna go
with it. Joel, you were

1249
00:58:41.550 --> 00:58:43.470
saying that I'm not saying
he knows. I'm saying that

1250
00:58:43.650 --> 00:58:45.390
early on, you were talking
about how it seems like

1251
00:58:45.390 --> 00:58:47.250
the people in the episode
and the objective seaside have

1252
00:58:47.250 --> 00:58:50.250
never really looked at anything
else. And that is exactly

1253
00:58:50.310 --> 00:58:51.600
the case. If you go
to your own site, if

1254
00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:54.900
you go to stack overflow.com,
which I visit, anytime somebody

1255
00:58:54.900 --> 00:58:58.380
asks a question about like
mano touch, you get five

1256
00:58:58.380 --> 00:59:00.000
angry comments about when do
you want to learn a

1257
00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:04.080
new language? Why don't you
just use objective? You get,

1258
00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:05.670
at least when you get
to these people who are

1259
00:59:05.670 --> 00:59:08.160
really upset about somebody wanting
to learn anything else. So

1260
00:59:08.280 --> 00:59:10.410
people don't like, I don't
want to say that people

1261
00:59:10.410 --> 00:59:12.420
don't like progress in the
objective C world, but they

1262
00:59:12.420 --> 00:59:16.860
just got objective. See progress.
Well, it's it's they, they

1263
00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:19.710
don't have perspective. They don't
like listening to you guys.

1264
00:59:19.710 --> 00:59:22.730
Talk about these things. I'm
thinking I'm just in there

1265
00:59:22.730 --> 00:59:25.610
with GDB, like stepping over
stuff, hoping that I can

1266
00:59:25.610 --> 00:59:27.500
expect. I can expect a
property. I've got to go

1267
00:59:27.500 --> 00:59:29.990
to the console to inspect
a property. By your hand,

1268
00:59:29.990 --> 00:59:35.120
using chemo. You code it
to work for Microsoft. Not

1269
00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:36.860
yet. I mean, I did,
I did that once and

1270
00:59:36.860 --> 00:59:38.060
it was, I mean, it
was cool. It was fun.

1271
00:59:38.060 --> 00:59:42.650
Everything. But I actually, I
like this. I it's not

1272
00:59:42.650 --> 00:59:45.050
suffering. It's a challenge. It's
a hobby. It's like, it's

1273
00:59:45.050 --> 00:59:47.780
like being a hobbyist. It's
it's it feels like, it

1274
00:59:47.780 --> 00:59:49.910
feels like the frontier, even
though it's actually really old,

1275
00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:51.640
but I mean, it feels
like you're a hobbyist. Who's

1276
00:59:51.640 --> 00:59:55.910
suffering. I'm a hobbyist. Who's
getting paid and suffering. Making

1277
00:59:55.910 --> 00:59:59.180
programming too easy is can
not end well, cannot end.

1278
00:59:59.180 --> 01:00:02.060
Well if programming, if the
compiler took care of everything,

1279
01:00:02.060 --> 01:00:04.240
if you just sort of
who needs these, like these,

1280
01:00:04.250 --> 01:00:06.500
these, these Cadillacs where there's
no, you don't feel the

1281
01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:09.230
road. Let's go fall. You're
going to hit. You're going

1282
01:00:09.230 --> 01:00:10.520
to hit a kid and
you're not going to know,

1283
01:00:12.020 --> 01:00:14.180
get a child with your
car. And the shock is

1284
01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:16.490
going to be so good.
We gotta, we gotta sign

1285
01:00:16.490 --> 01:00:18.020
this off, but I'm not
going to be able to

1286
01:00:18.020 --> 01:00:23.390
say the phone number of
this stack overflow. Now you're

1287
01:00:23.390 --> 01:00:25.100
hitting kids with cattle that
are never going to be

1288
01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:27.710
a little upset. I literally
don't even know where I

1289
01:00:27.710 --> 01:00:30.350
can put this thing. I
can't put it on. I

1290
01:00:30.350 --> 01:00:32.660
can't put it on Microsoft.
I can't put on Hanselman.

1291
01:00:32.660 --> 01:00:36.620
It's the audio and hitting
kids with Cadillacs. No, the

1292
01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:38.390
audio is horrible. I'm just
going to throw this thing

1293
01:00:38.390 --> 01:00:41.630
up on. This is going
to mega upload.com. I liked

1294
01:00:41.630 --> 01:00:43.640
it too. I thought it
was good. It was good.

1295
01:00:43.730 --> 01:00:45.260
Alright. Well we're going to
give it a thumbs up.

1296
01:00:45.260 --> 01:00:47.300
Ready? Wait, wait, wait, wait.
We'll make the audio good.

1297
01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:49.550
We will really, we will.
This is going to be

1298
01:00:49.550 --> 01:00:54.920
Hansel minutes and stack overflow
podcast and crappy edition contact

1299
01:00:54.940 --> 01:00:58.040
stack overflow. If you have
any questions for me and

1300
01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:01.640
Jeff call the stack overflow
podcast hotline. Oh, there it

1301
01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:06.380
is. (646) 826-3879 or email podcast
stack overflow.com is also where

1302
01:01:06.380 --> 01:01:11.660
we could patient training transcripts.
People who couldn't understand what

1303
01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:15.590
we were saying. Cause you
have to read it and

1304
01:01:15.590 --> 01:01:17.480
you can also parade us
in the comments. Thank you.

1305
01:01:17.490 --> 01:01:19.460
Feel free to bring some
comments. Now what's the closing

1306
01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:22.130
for the hands on minutes.
This has been another horrific

1307
01:01:22.130 --> 01:01:24.770
episode of Hansel minutes. We'll
see you again next week.
