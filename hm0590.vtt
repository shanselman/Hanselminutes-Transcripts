Hi, this is Scott Hanselman.

8
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.420
This is another episode of
Hansel minutes today. I'm talking

9
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.080
with Aria had ironed. He's
a technologist who is running

10
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.920
the engineering team at shape
security. How are you? God?

11
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.830
How are you? Thanks for
asking me. I'm thrilled. We've

12
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.220
been trying to get together
now for three years on

13
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.590
the show, but our schedules
have not lined up and

14
00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:09.210
today they did. All right.
Perfect. Yeah. I first learned

15
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.330
about you when I was
doing web automation and I

16
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.900
started playing with Phantom JS.
How long ago did you

17
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.350
work on that? And the
loss? My handiwork started about

18
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.860
seven years ago and I
think I announced it about

19
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:29.760
a Christmas 20 somethings 2011.
It's been in the process

20
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.130
for awhile, but I didn't
have time to Polish it

21
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.040
new listen to the world.
And finally, I had time

22
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.160
back then, man, it worked
out. So it was a

23
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.950
popular tool back then for
what proclamation is less popular

24
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.260
these days. And there's a
lot of other alternative, better

25
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.650
alternative development kind of slowed
down a little bit, but

26
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.040
it had this run. Why
do you think it was

27
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.230
so popular? Was it just
because it was the idea

28
00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.110
that something headless would be
valuable? I mean, I had

29
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.900
done selenium testing before, but
of course that required a

30
00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.550
browser. Yes. I think that
was one of the major

31
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.280
key point. You can just
download an executable pretty much

32
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.520
self contained and you hit
the ground running. So back

33
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.470
then it's quite a hassle
to set up. So I

34
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.350
knew much, much easier these
days. And I think that

35
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.370
makes it a sort of
alternative easy choice to do

36
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.550
web automation besides driving the
true Grasser of course. Right,

37
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.880
right. And now is seven
years in it's quite popular.

38
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.260
Of course, the 20 plus
thousand stars on, on a

39
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.990
get hub. But as you
said, it's, it's winding down,

40
00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.730
perhaps it's in a maintenance
mode. I think it's sort

41
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.020
of the victim of it.
It's unsuccess so there's only

42
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.770
very few following work happening
right now, but since it

43
00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.470
was popular for a while,
there's a massive expectation of

44
00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.860
what it should do, how
the future should be implemented,

45
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.960
what should be the should
be in the next release

46
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.760
and so on and so
forth. So there's a huge

47
00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.840
mismatch between the fallen team,
volunteering work happening for the

48
00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.540
development for sues the expectation
From the wild audience out

49
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.130
there. And it's sort of
typical problem in successful open

50
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.900
source project. That's, that's an
interesting point as a successful

51
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.420
open source project, I assume
that you had all of

52
00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.170
the experiences that any organizer
has, which is people expecting

53
00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.280
a lot of free work.
That is true. So interesting

54
00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.330
story. For instance, one time
I COVID package new release

55
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.560
and start building it for
some platform Linux and mango

56
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.570
ass. And I decided, okay,
let me take a breath

57
00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.520
on me. Let me get
some sleep for tomorrow morning.

58
00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.850
I'll continue. And both the
executable for windows the next

59
00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.970
morning, lo and behold, the
first email was whereas windows.

60
00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.710
So I couldn't even imagine
that someone is that hurry.

61
00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.150
And of course it's in,
in the beginning, I took

62
00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.580
it personally. But at the
end of the day, I

63
00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.980
know that this is the
expectation that people want from

64
00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.270
such projects. Hmm. Did you
have anger or people yelling

65
00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.610
at you or people who
not only wanted free work,

66
00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.730
but also demanded support and
Sunday at two in the

67
00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.550
morning? Huh? I think every
open source project mentoring is

68
00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.700
bound to experience all kinds
of insults, but I use

69
00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:13.710
that as an opportunity to
grow my skin and becomes

70
00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:16.830
thicker over time. I used
to joke that if you

71
00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:19.530
want a free anger management
course just meant an open

72
00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:25.170
source project. Did that ever
get you a feeling like

73
00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.920
you wanted to rage quit
Sometimes, but they don't at

74
00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.170
the end of the day.
What counts is that? First

75
00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.270
of all, it's impossible to
please everyone. Anyway. So if

76
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.270
you tried that you will
fail no matter what, but

77
00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.070
at the end of the
day, what counts is, as

78
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.800
long as there are people
benefiting from my work, whatever

79
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.650
it is, whether it's Phantom.
Lot of the other projects

80
00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.320
that I maintain, I think
that's enough for me. I

81
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.960
think that the motivation is
not to get fame and

82
00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.040
glory, but the motivation is
to do a full entering

83
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.590
work. And this is similar
to, you know, you package

84
00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.220
some care package or sandwich
for, for some unfortunate, less

85
00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.340
fortunate people. And, and you,
you feel that you couldn't

86
00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.530
do enough and that's okay.
As long as you, you

87
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.200
you've done your part and
people are happy and, and

88
00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.740
you feel good. I think
that should be the main

89
00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.350
motivation not to seek fame
or glory or anything else.

90
00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.120
That seems like an extremely
healthy attitude. I see a

91
00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.550
lot of people becoming very
angry at opensource and very

92
00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.210
angry, angry at the time,
the, the sense of being

93
00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:28.170
it, being thankless work. How
much of it do you

94
00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:33.300
think is attitude? It's scarf
becoming like that. I think

95
00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.200
it's, it's just natural. It's
human nature to demand more.

96
00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.940
And sometime you, as a
maintainer, you try to provide

97
00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.880
as much surface as possible.
But for, for the other

98
00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.130
end, because they haven't seen
that you actually need to

99
00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.710
work. You, you need to
have a day job. You

100
00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.780
need to take care of
your family. You need to

101
00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:55.020
take care of your pants.
You have add friends. They

102
00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.490
don't see that. So they,
they assume that, Oh, because

103
00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.370
you released this project for
free, then that's all you

104
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:04.040
do. You, you have nothing
else in your life. So

105
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.160
it's in one way, it's
unfair to expect any maintainer

106
00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:11.000
to work long hours to
release features or to work

107
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.970
on feature for, for the
projects at the same time.

108
00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:18.320
If you encounter, if you
see some mentors in real

109
00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.230
life, your perspective might change.
Suddenly you realize, Oh yeah,

110
00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.660
this person also needs to
do a lot of different

111
00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:28.100
things. And then the expectation
will be much, much different.

112
00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:29.870
I think it's the exploration
of the nature of open

113
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:32.030
source project is just, you
don't get to see the

114
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:35.210
maintainer or the volunteer or
the contributors of the project

115
00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:39.640
face to face. And that
becomes becomes challenging. Had you

116
00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.520
ever thought about building a
company around Phantom JS when

117
00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.770
it was at its peak
or how important do you

118
00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:48.970
think it is to be
OSS versus to be F

119
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.700
O S S So there
are two aspects of that

120
00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:53.920
first. I don't think I
have any business skills at

121
00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:57.190
all. So if I think
of creating company, it might

122
00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:00.550
be a big feller. And
second, I think that's a

123
00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:03.940
huge different between working on
something as, as, as part

124
00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:06.400
of your job and working
on something, because you find

125
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.090
it's fun. And I mentioned
about, you mentioned what rich

126
00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:12.670
quid, but I think that
the emphasize here is if

127
00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:16.420
you find, or if you
reach a point where maintaining

128
00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:18.340
a print on an opensource
project is not fun and

129
00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:20.770
stop doing that. Nobody forces
you to do that. So

130
00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:23.650
you shouldn't become depressed because
you're, you fall into some

131
00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:28.270
work. So there's that aspect
where I'm my feet. My

132
00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:30.340
biggest fear is that if
this turned into a job,

133
00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:34.870
then I will enjoy less
for me doing free and

134
00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:38.260
open source software is kind
of therapeutic because I also

135
00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.140
have a day job and
think of it. This is

136
00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:43.450
a hobby, as opposed to
something that I do to

137
00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:50.200
earn my living. There's a
great section on your GitHub

138
00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:53.740
called AMA. I've never seen
anyone do this before. You've

139
00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:57.250
made an ask me anything
and you're using GitHub issues

140
00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:00.250
to do the answers to
the AMA. Did you have

141
00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:02.710
this idea or is this
a unique idea? This is

142
00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:05.350
not unique at all. I
think I'm probably the 200

143
00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:07.660
person that does that. So
that is a fork of

144
00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:12.550
the original AMA and a
lot of very well known

145
00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:15.850
developer have done that. Hmm.
I like this idea. I

146
00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:20.050
may do this myself. Please
do. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So

147
00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:23.140
I'm on this one, you
have a great, a particular

148
00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:26.020
AMA it's number, number 20
that says what are the

149
00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:30.130
three most underrated overlooked open
source projects? Such a great

150
00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.920
question. I don't know if
do you have that up

151
00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:34.270
in front of you? If
not, I can read it

152
00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:36.940
to you. I do. So
what are some of the,

153
00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:41.080
your favorite underrated or overlooked
projects? So I put three

154
00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:47.830
Pasco on the list, I
think, yes. If you remember

155
00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:52.000
a turbo Pascal that that
is among others, the first

156
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.550
encounter to a lot of
teenagers back then to the

157
00:08:54.550 --> 00:09:00.390
world of, and free Pascal
is the implementation of Pascoe

158
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:05.280
GPL implementation. And it has
been in the dolphin one

159
00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:08.100
for 20 years, and there's
no indication that it is

160
00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:11.340
going to stop anytime soon.
It supports everything from 16

161
00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:14.850
bit dos. If you still
remember that to writing Pascal

162
00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:17.880
for iOS, a 64 bit
arm, I, I find that

163
00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:24.120
extremely fascinating these days, everyone
is really into JavaScript, but

164
00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:28.260
for some of us who
had the experience of learning

165
00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:31.890
basic Pascal and so on
and so forth, basketball is

166
00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:36.200
still one of the easiest
barrier into programming. Yeah, it

167
00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:39.560
is. I started in visual
basic three, but then immediately

168
00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:44.900
went into Pascal. I did
turbo Pascal back in 1993,

169
00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:48.860
I did Delphi. And as
you said, I think the

170
00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:51.380
most interesting aspect of this
is that it supports 16

171
00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:55.550
bit dos and 64 bit
arm, which is such an

172
00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:58.160
interesting idea that this language,
you know, short of C,

173
00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:01.220
it just kind of continues
and continues and continues. And

174
00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:03.230
it's much easier to read
than some of the other

175
00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:07.060
languages like lists that have,
have so much wide system.

176
00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.570
And there's also a component
library and a full blown

177
00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:16.100
IDE called Lazarus just the
other day. I needed to

178
00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:19.400
create something I'm running windows
10 and then to create

179
00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:22.220
a little utility with GUI.
And this is the fastest

180
00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:27.170
I could imagine it just
launched Lazarus, put a bunch

181
00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:29.870
of components, right? Some logic
and lo and behold it's

182
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:33.320
up and running in a
few minutes. Interesting. And which

183
00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:36.560
sounds a lot like visual
basic, right? It's that four

184
00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:39.470
GL experience. And you can
just drag some buttons and

185
00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:42.080
have some button click events.
And if you want, you

186
00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:45.560
can compel another version for
say Lennox, or as, Hmm.

187
00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:48.650
Is this an application that
is kind of sneaking its

188
00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:51.500
way under the radar? Why
don't, why isn't everyone talking

189
00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:56.030
about free Pascal, maybe because
Pascal's not Popular anymore. I

190
00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:59.600
know that as soon as
there was C and C

191
00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:03.740
plus plus and Java, and
then shop, of course basketball

192
00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:07.250
is considered old fashioned. I
don't know. Hmm. It's interesting.

193
00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:12.770
Because yesterday I was hacking
into my Nintendo wi and

194
00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:15.440
wanted to maybe write some
programs for it. And of

195
00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:19.640
course, there you go, free
pascal.org. You can download runtimes

196
00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:23.900
for the Nintendo Wii. I
didn't know that the social

197
00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:26.570
supports intend to be. Now
you give me an idea.

198
00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:29.210
Now you're going to think
about what you can move

199
00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:32.450
or to the we who
knows are the next application

200
00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:35.570
16 bit dos is supportive.
I'm sure it's a much

201
00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:38.090
easier to support intern. Do
we as a platform? Yeah,

202
00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:41.240
yeah, yeah. Okay. What's another
one. The other one is

203
00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:46.520
the Apache traffic server. People
are probably familiar with Apache

204
00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:50.420
HTP server and another four
pro surfers, such as engine

205
00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:54.460
X ThreadFix are very, very
similar to engine X that

206
00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:57.040
as a form of 41st
proxy, this is not usually

207
00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:00.310
very well known for normal
developer because unless you work

208
00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:04.720
on a server site, a
web WebEx or some technology,

209
00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:11.740
then it's not very, very
well known. Again, it processes

210
00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:15.220
terabit per second of traffic
at Yahoo. And I can't

211
00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:19.270
remember another company sponsor of
this traffic surfer was originated

212
00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:22.810
from Inktomi if you still
remember those days. Oh, wow.

213
00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:25.840
Tommy was acquired by the,
by Yahoo and Yahoo decided,

214
00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:28.330
no, let's just make this
a open source. So they

215
00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:30.700
released the source code. In
fact, in some, in some

216
00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:32.710
part of the search code,
you can still see the

217
00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:35.700
reference to in Tommy Really.
And do you think that

218
00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:37.860
there's still value in traffic
server in a world of

219
00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:41.520
engine X? Oh yeah. It's
still being widely used. We

220
00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:43.950
just don't know about it.
And now it's part of

221
00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:49.650
the project for under a
Apache foundation And quietly handling

222
00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:53.970
400 terabytes a day at
Yahoo. It supports HDP to

223
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.050
web socket, all the latest
technology, you name it. Interesting.

224
00:12:58.050 --> 00:12:59.970
You know, the two things
that I finding in common

225
00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:03.870
between free Pascal and Apache
traffic server are that their

226
00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:09.090
websites look old fashion. I
wonder if people are likely

227
00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:12.990
to stumble on an opensource
project, see a website that's

228
00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:16.890
not bootstrap or not pretty
or not a fancy WordPress

229
00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:19.680
theme. And they simply can't
Write it off. On the

230
00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:24.540
other hand is functional. On
the other hand, it's functional.

231
00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:26.520
See there, there is a
tee shirt right there that

232
00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:30.240
we need to make And
that's last for more than

233
00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:34.290
a decade. So it's a
true Testament to its survivability.

234
00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:38.430
Do you think that people
in open source in 2017

235
00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:42.990
are a little frivolous with
their, with their preferences, maybe

236
00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:46.320
a little bit not. They're
interested in the new thing

237
00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:48.660
and they run towards the
new thing rather than thinking

238
00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:53.040
about the, the reliable Old
thing. It might be the

239
00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:56.370
problem that we create ourselves
because we tend to glorify

240
00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:59.190
new inefficient, new projects, new
library, new ways to do

241
00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:03.600
things in all kinds of
forms, write a newsletter or

242
00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:07.440
medium POS or Twitter or
whatsoever. But we sometimes forget

243
00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:10.470
that we also need to
celebrate a long lasting project.

244
00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:14.220
For instance, what if newsletters
start to mention, Hey, this

245
00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:16.950
project's own sort of celebrate
this fourth birthday or a

246
00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:20.100
fifth birthday start from small
number. And I think it

247
00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:24.360
will draw more attention to
the fact that sometime there

248
00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:28.440
are projects designed for, we
can fund their projects that

249
00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:33.330
can survive years and years
of ups and downs. And

250
00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:35.610
if we, if we look
at GitHub as the form

251
00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:39.570
of the, the, the center
of social coding, there's no

252
00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:42.930
way to distinguish within project
that I throw together. And

253
00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:45.240
then I feel that, Oh,
someone might find it useful

254
00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:48.780
and put it up there.
Versus I took some time

255
00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:52.250
to design this years and
I've took some time to

256
00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:55.310
come up with the proper
architecture. And I hope when

257
00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:58.130
I released this is gonna
last for a hundred years,

258
00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:01.280
there's no really label for
that. And therefore it's hard

259
00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:04.730
for, for folks to understand
that some projects have different

260
00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:08.320
threat of than other projects.
Do you think it's, do

261
00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:11.650
you think that it's possible
to, to, to start a

262
00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:13.900
project and say this one
is gonna be around for

263
00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:16.090
a long time and this
one's not, or you're saying

264
00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:17.710
that you just don't know,
you never have a way

265
00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:20.470
of knowing when you try
something out. If it's going

266
00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:24.340
to become the next Ruby
or the next node, everyone's

267
00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:27.370
just out there coming up
with new ideas and maybe

268
00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:30.490
it sticks. And maybe it
doesn't, It's hard to say

269
00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:32.500
on one hand, as long
as there's the men, as

270
00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:36.160
long as there's no need
for that project. And there

271
00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:39.850
will be that then there's
the men tenants motivations. I

272
00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:42.970
think that project is going
to last for awhile. I

273
00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:47.710
observed a lot of projects,
projects, which are successful projects

274
00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:50.020
with fail after just few
months and so on and

275
00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:53.320
so forth. And I'll observe
that sometime, if you, if

276
00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:55.690
you try not to be
ambitious on your first release,

277
00:15:56.110 --> 00:16:00.250
if you try small and
then improve it, some parts

278
00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:02.110
of the project and an
improvement of the part and

279
00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:03.760
implement some of the features
and so on and so

280
00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:07.750
forth, I think that's going
to last much longer than

281
00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:11.680
you create the project, just
to feel full, fulfill your

282
00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:16.240
adrenaline rush. In other words,
this is the, there's a

283
00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:18.520
famous saying that you just
need to run faster than

284
00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:21.790
a friend. If, if, if,
if you see some verus

285
00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:24.730
trying to catch you, I
think rather than coming up

286
00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:28.390
with the best possible technology
and with zero defects or

287
00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:32.440
bugs on your first release,
if you improve your project,

288
00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:35.980
one thing at a time,
one feature per week or

289
00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:38.470
per month, whatever it is.
And you keep doing that

290
00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:41.140
for years and years, you
are gone. You're going to

291
00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:44.530
outrun everyone. Even if every
project was superior in the

292
00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:48.370
very beginning, it doesn't really
matter. If you walk one

293
00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:50.500
step at a time, eventually
you reach a very fair

294
00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:53.620
far destination compared to someone
who just, you know, sprint

295
00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:56.530
and then stop. So just
like in sport, that's a

296
00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:59.650
huge difference between focusing on
endurance and focusing on speed.

297
00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:03.220
For instance, I don't have
any endurance to physically fit

298
00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:06.580
so I can run marathon.
But if you asked me

299
00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:10.240
to play basketball or badminton,
we're where you need this.

300
00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:13.120
High-speed for just a couple
of seconds. I could do

301
00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:14.590
that. And after that, I
need to catch my breath.

302
00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:18.370
Of course. So there's a
huge difference between people who

303
00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:24.060
like to do one little
thing every week, every month

304
00:17:24.070 --> 00:17:27.040
fascist someone who I just
want to, I have this

305
00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:29.230
crazy thought. I want to
create this project. And in,

306
00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:31.210
in, in a month, I'm
just going to wrap it

307
00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:33.580
up, release it to the
open source community as a

308
00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:37.150
gift, but then don't ask
me what any support whatsoever.

309
00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:41.020
It sounds like you've got
a very positive attitude about

310
00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:44.350
not only life, but code
in that you're saying continuous

311
00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:50.130
improvement, small measurable improvement, always
moving forward with a attitude,

312
00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:55.850
Not, not big giant sprints,
not Herculean efforts, just consistency.

313
00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:00.850
Correct. And I think it's
important because when, when I

314
00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:03.380
look at this projects, I
don't know if you remember

315
00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:05.120
this, but a few weeks
ago, the main general for

316
00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:08.990
Gillepsie has steps down after
30 years of maintain maintenance

317
00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:13.070
of Gillepsie. That's unheard of.
And, and we need to

318
00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:16.940
learn from, from this folks,
from this projects, because I

319
00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:23.780
think it's this meant donors.
We serve deserve some respect

320
00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:26.900
and we should start to
highlight them as opposed to

321
00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:30.350
just new projects. And that
way, we also start to

322
00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:33.740
give examples to new folks,
to open source that, yeah,

323
00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:37.430
it's okay to do one
thing, one small thing every

324
00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:40.880
week consistently for years and
years, and keep doing that

325
00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:44.270
and keep getting new inspiration,
getting in touch with new

326
00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:48.920
people or support new platforms
such as free Pascal. And

327
00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:51.820
that's, that's not, that's not
a bad thing. That's, that's,

328
00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:56.210
that's, that's also an honorable
thing. Yeah. The maintainer that

329
00:18:56.210 --> 00:19:00.380
you're referring to is Roland
McGrath, who started working on

330
00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:05.060
G lib C when he
was 15 in 1987 and

331
00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:09.140
spent 30 years working on
that project. So not, not

332
00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:12.590
starting as a professional, but
definitely ending as one. I'm

333
00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:16.100
sure there are people in
your podcast listener, or even,

334
00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:19.450
even their parents who are
not born yet when Roland

335
00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:23.330
start mentioning Gillepsie It was
also a teenager in 1987.

336
00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:26.390
I may have been reading
Roland's mailing lists cause we

337
00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:31.220
were contemporaries, but definitely not
as, as accomplished. And I'm

338
00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:33.620
sure, very sure that there
are people who are listening,

339
00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:36.830
who were both very experienced
at that time. And who

340
00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:40.340
also, as you said, were
not born yet. There's definitely

341
00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:41.810
a lot of tools that
would have been created in

342
00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:44.390
the last 30 years since
Roland started on G Lipsey.

343
00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:48.620
You also call that a
third opensource project that is

344
00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:53.870
a, a source code management
system. Yes. Fossil. And it

345
00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:57.050
was born about the same
time when it was born.

346
00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:01.100
One of the, one of
the crazy things about fossil

347
00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:04.820
is that it's not only
version control. It's not only

348
00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:06.890
like get where you store
it, but it's, it also

349
00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:09.980
has Wiki and he should
track her and everything is

350
00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:15.800
integrated. And the repository file
is one single file, which

351
00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:18.380
is a database, a sequel,
a database. It is created

352
00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:21.020
by a rechart tip, which
is also the author of

353
00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:26.030
SQL line. And it's just
as powerful as skip, but

354
00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:31.190
not very popular, Very popular,
a very simple looking modest

355
00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:34.460
website with no real sense
of dates when it was

356
00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:36.650
created, how long it is,
how old it is, but

357
00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:39.590
it has some really interesting
and innovative features that I

358
00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:44.030
frankly wish that we had
in, in get one of

359
00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:49.630
the most impressive things about
fossil. You can get it@fossilhyphenscm.org

360
00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:52.810
is that you can type
fossil UI and then the

361
00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:55.570
name of your repository. And
suddenly it will pop up

362
00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:58.300
a web browser with a
local web server. What a

363
00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:01.680
clever idea. I think it
has the same feature, but

364
00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:03.960
this is one thing where
a simple features makes a

365
00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:07.500
huge difference. If you have
multiple repository, you keep, you

366
00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:10.530
can keep typing fossil UI
for each repository, and it

367
00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:14.220
will search for the Mo
the first unused TCP port

368
00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:17.130
to serve that web web
server. So you can have

369
00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:20.820
three different web browsing session
for us, a gooey interface

370
00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:25.560
through two, three different fossil
repositories that is not easily

371
00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:29.190
possible with get, Yeah, well
get, has a, an extension

372
00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:32.940
called get web UI, but
I did not know if

373
00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:35.250
get itself has this kind
of same kind of feature

374
00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:39.030
it does. It does. Oh,
really? Do you know how

375
00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:41.310
I can learn about that?
I would. I'm you're teaching

376
00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:44.610
me something right now. I
think I tweeted about that

377
00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:47.070
sometime. Good. But I forgot
about it. I will go

378
00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:49.800
and look for your tweets.
What's amazing thing about fossil

379
00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:54.300
is everything is in one
single self-contained excavate will file

380
00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:58.380
and on windows, the, the
executable fuss to make a

381
00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:03.270
bet, something really. So at
Taylor Swift song is larger

382
00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:07.200
than, than all these features
back into fossil Or the

383
00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:13.620
average animated GIF. Right. Interesting.
And it does make you

384
00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:16.650
wonder though again, why these
kinds of features don't win,

385
00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:18.690
you know, and I think
that the, the thing that

386
00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:21.030
we're seeing about all of
the things that you're bringing

387
00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:25.560
up are a certain sense
of, of modesty, of, of

388
00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:31.140
simplicity, of a certain kind
of, of elegance. I'm also

389
00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:35.370
curious, maybe it's also because
there's no scandal, there's no

390
00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:38.430
story, there's no drama and
therefore it draws, it doesn't

391
00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:41.970
draw any attention. Fossil does
exactly what it promised you

392
00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:45.540
to do. And it doesn't
do more than this. No,

393
00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:51.300
the main Turner is an
extremely reasonable gentlemen, so there's

394
00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:55.650
no controversy or that kind
of thing. Interesting. I feel

395
00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:57.780
like you've touched on that
a little bit. You're referring

396
00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:00.390
to the actual maintainer of
the project rather than the

397
00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:05.070
project itself. Are you thinking
that some projects we learn

398
00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:08.850
more about because they have
big personalities behind them, or

399
00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:15.690
There is some friction or
differences in opinion, strong opinions

400
00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:19.560
that causes it to get
picked up by say something

401
00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:22.320
like the Fox and appears
in some medium paws and

402
00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:25.470
you know, all tweets and
that kind of thing. Yeah.

403
00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:27.300
Interesting. And that's not necessarily
what you want in a

404
00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:30.840
healthy project. Right? Another thing
that is interesting is that

405
00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:35.820
some of these projects have
excellent, excellent documentation. I cannot

406
00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:40.080
emphasize that enough. And therefore,
sometimes you don't need to

407
00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:43.530
ask anyone about it or
you don't need to throw

408
00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:45.860
a question to stack overflow
or melon lists and any

409
00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:49.610
of the form. And therefore
people will encounter that less

410
00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:53.000
compared to, Hey, this tool
is fantastic. I don't know

411
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.580
how to do it. Just
ask everyone and see if

412
00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:59.260
someone comes up this sort
of solution. Yeah, it is.

413
00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:01.210
That is the number one
thing that is so important

414
00:24:01.210 --> 00:24:04.240
about open source projects is
good documentation. And so much

415
00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:09.010
of the new stuff doesn't
have good documentation, Both in

416
00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:12.040
the form of written documentation,
or even in a form

417
00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:15.310
of verbal in case someone
give a talk or presentation

418
00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:20.140
about that. I found that
that web server that you

419
00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:22.600
were mentioning that was built
in to get it's called

420
00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:25.390
Insta web. And I found
your tweet on it that

421
00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:27.310
I'll include in the show
notes. It turns out the

422
00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:28.780
reason that I don't know
about it is that it

423
00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:32.980
only works on non windows
devices. So now you've given

424
00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:34.900
me a task, I'm going
to go learn how to

425
00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:38.860
make that work on windows.
We can use the windows

426
00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:42.340
subsystem for Linux. That's a
great point. I bet you,

427
00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:43.870
that would work out of
the box on that. So

428
00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:47.350
now I'll try that after
we're done, that's fantastic, which

429
00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:51.340
is get Insta web, My
favorite feature of windows 10.

430
00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:55.960
Interesting. So you mentioned that
you have a windows machine.

431
00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:58.420
Did you need that Linux
subsystem or were you a

432
00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:02.650
windows person before I switched
to windows from Mac Stan?

433
00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:08.350
Precisely because there is windows
subsystem for Linux. None that

434
00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:11.980
I can't use windows, but
there are certain things that

435
00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:16.330
makes it easier to work
on real Linux system. And

436
00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:18.370
you found that it was
complete enough that it allowed

437
00:25:18.370 --> 00:25:20.710
you to get done what
you needed to get done.

438
00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:25.110
Yeah, absolutely. Although you and
others mentioned that running GUI

439
00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:29.500
is not really supportive. It
works well and interesting in,

440
00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:32.290
in cases where I need
it. Yeah. Yeah. The only

441
00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:33.940
thing that I've found that
I wasn't able to do

442
00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:36.520
with it was things like
Docker, where I, you know,

443
00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:39.010
Docker server, I can run
Docker as a client, but

444
00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:42.070
not more than that. So
Colonel level stuff, or low

445
00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:44.080
level hardware things where I
wanted to talk to a

446
00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:47.380
serial port, I wasn't able
to do, but 99% of

447
00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:50.320
everything else, I've had no
issues with Completely agree. And

448
00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:53.350
it's also fantastic because it's
a, the vanilla Linux is

449
00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:57.130
not some other project that
you need to compile yourself

450
00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:59.740
if the burner is available
and you know, that kind

451
00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:04.150
of hassle. So what are
you doing at shape? I

452
00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:07.870
am running the 50% engineering
team at shape for about

453
00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:11.650
almost four years. Right now
we are specialized in preventing

454
00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:16.510
automotive attacks on weapon APS
servers. And yeah, so far

455
00:26:16.690 --> 00:26:20.620
we can't disclose our customers,
but so far we have

456
00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:25.990
big customers in the verticals
of airlines, sufficient system retails.

457
00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:29.290
And so on, The reason
that I ask is because

458
00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:32.560
there's been a theme kind
of throughout our interview today,

459
00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:35.620
which is the sense of,
of calmness of, of gently

460
00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:38.140
moving forward. And on your
blog, you talked about the

461
00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:42.550
concept of emotional resilience, particularly
when creating a small organization

462
00:26:42.550 --> 00:26:44.820
or working on, on a
startup. Can you talk a

463
00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:48.860
little bit about that? Yeah.
This is definitely my own.

464
00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:51.620
I'm trying to document my
own experience as I try

465
00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:54.740
to help shape. This is
my second startup. I used

466
00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:57.950
to work for a center.
The, the maker of UX

467
00:26:57.950 --> 00:27:02.420
did yes. If you still
remember that framework. And as

468
00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:06.170
we, as we grow the
team, we try to identify

469
00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:09.890
what makes a great team,
why certain team works or

470
00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:13.940
certain composition of teams work
and certain sworn. And one

471
00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:18.530
of the common theme is
that apparently grip teams have

472
00:27:18.530 --> 00:27:22.490
this resilience built into them
so that it creates a

473
00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:25.490
healthy organization. It can reject,
or it can defeat all

474
00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:31.280
kind of intervention from external
or internal because it's resilience

475
00:27:31.290 --> 00:27:35.120
enough to bounce back from
that moment and then start

476
00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:41.570
to pursue its mission. When
you're in a tech startup

477
00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:45.800
that has really high risk,
it can be really stressful

478
00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:48.320
if you make mistakes, though,
and that can break people

479
00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:54.860
down emotionally. Absolutely. We have
to be extremely careful about

480
00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:58.340
that. We need to understand
why someone is working there.

481
00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:01.430
What is their motivation? What
makes them tick? What makes

482
00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:05.060
them successful? What are the
strengths? How can we harness

483
00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:09.800
that? Strengths? Empathy is extremely
important here. And there's a

484
00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:14.810
lot of discussion about engineers
who become senior enough and

485
00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:17.210
then who become a manager
for the first time and

486
00:28:17.210 --> 00:28:19.130
didn't know what to do.
And I think there's a

487
00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:22.370
lot of, it's a lot
of movement out there these

488
00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:26.360
days to start to educate
everyone who got into that

489
00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:29.660
career path to understand what
it takes to be a,

490
00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:32.000
a good manager, what is
takes to be a good

491
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.930
supervisor. I like the notion
where you judge a manager

492
00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:41.840
by how much every individual's
reporting managers progress over time.

493
00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:46.100
So I view managers as
a, as a teacher. If,

494
00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.520
if all the students in
a class for the teachers

495
00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:52.610
fail, then we give the
blame to the teacher. Of

496
00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:55.280
course, That is a, that's
a very challenging thing to

497
00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:58.430
translate your, your skills. If
you spend five or 10

498
00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:01.940
years as an individual contributor,
and then suddenly you're being

499
00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:04.880
judged, not on your contributions,
but on the sum of

500
00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:08.300
your team's contributions. And I
think this is why I

501
00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:11.840
believe there are many different
career path, an engineer who,

502
00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:15.320
who has the aspiration to
continue to produce high quality

503
00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:21.830
code. Maybe that's their strength.
If they don't have the

504
00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:26.330
drive or the excitement and
the happiness of making other

505
00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:29.930
people also as good as
them, it doesn't have to,

506
00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:33.040
they don't need to be
forced to become a manager

507
00:29:33.050 --> 00:29:36.470
supervisor. Otherwise you're going to
lose one good engineer and

508
00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:38.810
you get, you're going to
get one bad manager. That's

509
00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:42.370
not the William insufflation. Yeah,
absolutely. So how do you,

510
00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:46.000
as the lead, try to
try to move the organization

511
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.150
towards emotional resilience? Is it
mostly by modeling that behavior?

512
00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:53.500
Correct. So there's a lot
of investment in building the

513
00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:56.710
relationship. I talk a lot
about the book called beyond

514
00:29:56.710 --> 00:30:00.610
office politics. Despite the title,
the title carries the politics

515
00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:04.000
as a word, there's nothing
bad about the book. In

516
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.720
fact, it's extremely powerful. It
describes why some people have

517
00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:11.770
certain drive. And it's also
allows you to be able

518
00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:16.090
to form a certain kind
of relation that makes that

519
00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:20.440
organization healthy. There was also
another book dealing with conflict

520
00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:27.400
resolution. I love crucial conversation
and verbal judo, and, and

521
00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:31.960
I think investing in the
relationship between individuals, between, within

522
00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:39.040
managers, those aren't the keys
to create a highly productive,

523
00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:44.830
fast paced organization. How, how
important is this, this idea

524
00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:47.680
of emotional health, as opposed
to technical health? I noticed

525
00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:50.830
in your list of books
that you recommend, there's fewer

526
00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:53.380
technical books than I would
expect. You have, you suggest

527
00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:58.180
books on personal productivity and
office politics. And somehow that

528
00:30:58.180 --> 00:31:00.220
surprised me. I think of
you as being a very

529
00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:03.970
technical person. I think, I
think it's a burst into

530
00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:06.610
one thing. So if you,
if you don't know something,

531
00:31:06.850 --> 00:31:09.610
we can learn about it.
And it's really fast to

532
00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:12.250
learn something technical because you
have a lot of resources

533
00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:16.300
to do that. On the
other hand, things like how

534
00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:21.670
to build a healthy organization.
It's not only exact science

535
00:31:21.670 --> 00:31:25.150
and therefore to measure it.
It's very hard. And there's

536
00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:27.370
also cultural differences that they
need to be aware of.

537
00:31:27.670 --> 00:31:31.180
And therefore, if you see
that one organization successful with

538
00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:33.970
certain recipe, it doesn't mean
that suddenly it works for

539
00:31:33.970 --> 00:31:36.220
you. There's a lot of
tweaks and a lot of

540
00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:41.170
customization necessary. And I think
it warrants a lot of

541
00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:45.100
attention. We were born not
being able to speak any

542
00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:48.010
language. Yes. In few years
we couldn't communicate with, with

543
00:31:48.010 --> 00:31:52.060
our parents with various using
various language. So I don't

544
00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:54.850
think there's a huge better
in learning new technology. I

545
00:31:54.850 --> 00:32:01.510
think there's, there's undiscovered barriers
in building relationship and building

546
00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:05.890
healthy organization. That's cool. I
really appreciate your, your positive

547
00:32:05.890 --> 00:32:07.810
attitude. And I appreciate the
time that you've given me

548
00:32:07.810 --> 00:32:12.220
today. Thank you for having
me. This has been another

549
00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:14.770
episode of Hansel minutes and
we'll see you again next

550
00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:22.440
week. <inaudible>.
