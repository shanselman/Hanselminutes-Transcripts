00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.300
In this episode from mixed
Oh nine. Scott talks with

9
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.840
Chris woods, a program manager
on the mobile browser platform

10
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.580
team. Hi, this is Scott
Hanselman, and this is another

11
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.130
episode of Hansel minutes, and
I'm here at Mixo nine

12
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:06.710
talking to Chris woods program
manager on the mobile browser

13
00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.730
platform team, and something pretty
cool happened at mix. When

14
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.220
we were talking about mobile,
they released something on code

15
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.820
Plex with the MSPL, which
is our most permissive open

16
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.250
source license. Chris, what did,
what did you guys release?

17
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.330
We released the, a device
database, basically a database of

18
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.420
the top 500 devices that
we see on windows life.

19
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.290
And it provides a bunch
of capabilities for those devices

20
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.980
allows you to adapt to
the render content or mobile

21
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.130
handsets. So is a database,
but this is an app

22
00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.140
or they call an app
browser file. Is that right?

23
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.530
Or dot browser file browser
file. And it is a

24
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.430
database that is effectively of
their glorified XML file. You

25
00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.750
drop it into asp.net and
asp.net will automatically pick it

26
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.200
up. And I was playing
with all the capabilities you

27
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.440
needed automatically pass this, this
file for you, caches the

28
00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.590
results. Now I remember years
and years ago when I

29
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.590
was doing mobile, there was
this browser capabilities section of

30
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.260
the web config, and it
would get bigger and bigger

31
00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.500
and bigger. And the blogging
engine that, that I work

32
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.190
on called DAS blog ended
up having a 256 K

33
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.590
or 300 K web config.
Cause it was just full

34
00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.550
of this really strange format.
Yeah. asp.net two. They introduced

35
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.160
this notion of the dot
browser file. Yes, that's right.

36
00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.580
The dub browser file already
superseded the web config. Okay.

37
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.560
So this is something I
could drop in my site

38
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.020
now. And now do I
need a DLL to make

39
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.940
this work or all of
the existing kinds of things

40
00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.130
that I call going to
going to work? Yeah. All

41
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.040
the existing stuff that you've
got works. There's no additional

42
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.920
binary that's needed. You just
simply drop the file into

43
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.000
your app, grabs his folder
slash mobile and then drop

44
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.770
it in there slash mobile.
And you're all set. It

45
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.050
just picks it up your
Apple refresh and you'll have

46
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.950
all the latest capabilities available
to you in your asp.net

47
00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.560
page. So you said the
top five hundreds, like how

48
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.040
many, how many mobile devices
are there out there? Oh,

49
00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.370
there's thousands. Thousands of devices.
So, but what we've done

50
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.360
is tried to pick the
most useful are the ones

51
00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.060
These people are using. Cause
if I understand you actually

52
00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.010
pick this from usage, you
didn't just make these up,

53
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.690
but you said these are
the top. These are the

54
00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.200
ones that visited. Yeah. So
they, they reflect the most

55
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.500
popular browsers or most popular
mobile handsets that we see

56
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.450
hitting windows live. Particularly we
look at the Hotmail usage

57
00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.900
figures. We can see who's
using what and these phones

58
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.820
appear to be the most
popular. Right? Yeah. And are

59
00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.040
we talking 70% of them
are like, we can cover

60
00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.380
70% or like 90%. I
mean, I'm looking at ballpark

61
00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:38.190
Ballpark looking around 80, 85%.
Oh really? Okay. So we

62
00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.960
can get a pretty good
sense of these things. Now

63
00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.440
there's a number of different
levels of what I would

64
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.050
care about when I'm doing
mobile At the simplest level.

65
00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.170
There's just, is it a
mobile browser or not? Yes.

66
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.380
So I could say something
like, you know, if request.browser.is

67
00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.530
mobile. Yeah. Do this, otherwise
do that. Yeah. Yeah. That's,

68
00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.780
that'd be the first sort
of level of customization that

69
00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.210
you could apply. But we
supply a lot of we've

70
00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:03.660
spliced, the 67 different capabilities
that you can query about

71
00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.380
the incoming request, 67 capabilities,
67. So what are some

72
00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.960
examples you can find out
if it's a touch screen

73
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:15.300
device, you can find out
some CSS support information. You

74
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.990
can find out what image
files, it supports, what Kodak's

75
00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:22.410
video, codecs audio Kodak's, the
device will support. So if

76
00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.140
you've got a photo site,
you could adaptively run the

77
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.530
photos or pick the appropriate
format. But if you're trying

78
00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.020
to sell MP3s to a
mobile phone, you'd be able

79
00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.390
to work out well, Hey,
it doesn't support MP3s, but

80
00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.660
it supports AAC instead. Ah,
so that's a really interesting

81
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.390
example that just gave up
a gallery. So let's say

82
00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.180
I've got an, you know,
flicker like site, I've got

83
00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.620
a gallery and I've got
a bunch of files, but

84
00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.630
let's say that I'm storing
them as a, as PNGs.

85
00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.420
And I I've, I found
a phone today. Someone showed

86
00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:49.920
me a mobile phone and
I tried to have them

87
00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.640
test a mobile site that
I was working on. It

88
00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.390
turns out that their phone
didn't support me. Yeah. There's

89
00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:58.290
a surprising number of relativity
advanced handsets that you see

90
00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.800
out there today that they
actually don't support panties at

91
00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.460
all. If they've got a
broken image icon. Yeah. And

92
00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.700
that's not a great user
experience. So without device data,

93
00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.740
you'd know ahead of time,
this phone doesn't support a

94
00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.980
PNG and you've got, you've
got a couple of choices

95
00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.750
you could try and read
code the file on the

96
00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:19.080
fly that might not be
proficient enough. You might have

97
00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.590
precast versions of these images
floating about, you can pick

98
00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.460
one of those instead. But
what we aim to do

99
00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.190
is provide you as the
web developer enough information that

100
00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.650
you can customize your site
based on what you need.

101
00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:33.330
And one of the things
that I noticed that I

102
00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.240
was looking for the list
of capabilities should there's 67

103
00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.790
of them was that there
was a lot of granularity,

104
00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:41.640
but it's not like it's
not exhaustive in the sense

105
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:42.750
of, it's not telling me
a bunch of stuff. I

106
00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.000
wouldn't want to know. An
example would be like a,

107
00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:47.280
you know, support CSS. That's
kind of an obvious thing

108
00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.190
to ask, but one of
them was supports the CSS

109
00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:54.150
background color property. So you're
actually telling me if the

110
00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:58.750
phone supported this one specific
CSS. Yes. Because That's a

111
00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.860
rule I would very likely
care about. Yeah. So there

112
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.130
is, what we've tried to
do is, well, internally we,

113
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.930
we have the 67 capabilities,
but we've tried to pick

114
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:11.540
67 capabilities. That would mean
something to a web developer.

115
00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.230
There's other factors you could
have in there, for instance,

116
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:20.660
to support WML a, of
modern handsets can support WML

117
00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:23.210
as a legacy, a throwback,
but there's no use to

118
00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:26.720
most modern websites who wouldn't
use that. Anyway. Now, when

119
00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.590
I was doing Mobile and
banking years ago, we were

120
00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:31.960
talking to partners about Rayanne
coding and we would use

121
00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:35.500
terms like web gateways and
WML, and WML this version

122
00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.380
of them. And it was
really quite a miserable experience.

123
00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:42.070
I almost feel like I
blinked and that just disappeared.

124
00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:44.230
Is that a nonissue or
is that just a nonissue

125
00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:46.930
in the, in the Western
world? What we're seeing is

126
00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:51.460
that that the most well
used handsets are the ones

127
00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:54.820
that have a good browse
experience on them. So we're

128
00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:57.460
looking at the top 500
devices you'd seen, majority of

129
00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:01.600
those would have hasty male
support of some kind. Now

130
00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.650
of course, each to male
support varies widely between browsers

131
00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:09.250
anywhere and particularly so in
the mobile sphere where browsers

132
00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.820
will often say that they
support web standards, but really

133
00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:15.880
don't, or even the same
browser and the different handset

134
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.700
will behave slightly differently. Really?
Yeah. We often find that

135
00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:26.320
for instance, access a Chinese
company, they produce a browser

136
00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:31.780
mobile browser. And as a
device manufacturer that and your

137
00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:35.830
handset, they will customize that
browser for that handset. So

138
00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:38.800
I've got, so if I'm
pulling out a new mobile

139
00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.800
phone and it's got haptic
support and vibrates, when I

140
00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:44.530
touch it and I want
a great touch feel, I'll

141
00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:47.560
alter the code base code
base of the browser to

142
00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.440
make it smoother. Slicker, give
me a better user experience.

143
00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:54.970
You just picked access as
an example, but right. They

144
00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:56.860
may not do it. It's
just, just to give you

145
00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:59.980
a feel, Makes me feel
like that we're still in

146
00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:01.810
an area we're still in
a, in a place right

147
00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:03.520
now with mobile, that we're
going to be chasing our

148
00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:06.040
tails to get a hundred
percent. I mean, you're not

149
00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.620
going to ever going to
hit an awesome, awesome experience

150
00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:13.000
on every single device. That's
a very tall order really

151
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.300
is what we're seeing in
our experiences, that there is

152
00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:24.400
a consolidation and the market
is consolidating a bunch of

153
00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:31.300
handsets and browsers, mobile browsers
that provide great, just a

154
00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:37.000
great, great web browse experience.
So yeah, it's not going

155
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.200
to be possible to get
a a hundred percent all

156
00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.570
the time. There's always the
long tail, but that long

157
00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:45.820
tail is getting shorter effectively
as people consolidate. Well, when

158
00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:47.920
you guys kind of contacted
me a couple of days

159
00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:49.360
ago, and you gave me
this file a day or

160
00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.820
two, before it started out,
I had been preparing a

161
00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:55.230
talk for, for about nerd
dinner, nerd dinners, a website

162
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:59.340
I've got that, lets nerds
have dinner together. And, and

163
00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:00.810
I said, Oh, wait a
second. This is going to

164
00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:02.700
be cool. I can make
a mobile version. So I

165
00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:05.340
sat down and I took
your file. Yep. I drug

166
00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:09.030
it into app browser slash
mobile. And then I I'm

167
00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:11.760
using MVC. Although you could
use this on NBC, or

168
00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:14.430
you can use this on
wave forms. And I basically

169
00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:17.520
wrote code that said, if
it's a mobile browser, look

170
00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:20.550
for a view here in
slash mobile, otherwise look there.

171
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:23.640
So I just started with
what I was thinking. I

172
00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:27.060
called it tiny HTML and
it was just the simplest

173
00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:29.100
possible thing that would work.
It was like input box

174
00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:32.540
button, and then unordered list.
Oh, you know, that's really

175
00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:36.560
interesting because I'm customizing for
a mobile handset or any

176
00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:40.250
mobile experience. Isn't just about
reformatting the page. So it

177
00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:43.460
looks good. The user experience
on the phones, different people

178
00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:47.090
do different things with a
mobile phone. So why am

179
00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:49.250
I wanting to go check
no dinner out when I'm,

180
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:51.230
when I'm out and about
with a mobile phone? Well,

181
00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:53.180
now you're questioning The whole
reason to put it on

182
00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:55.220
mobile. But an example would
be that we had a

183
00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:57.710
nerd dinner on Tuesday. Yeah.
And a guy was walking

184
00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:00.740
to the dinner And couldn't
remember where it was. Exactly.

185
00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.050
So this is slightly different
use case, which is interesting.

186
00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:05.810
Cause I thought he'd want
to search for them To

187
00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:08.960
get directions, which I hadn't
even thought about. Yeah. So

188
00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:12.290
I sent him to a
page that showed an address,

189
00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:15.470
but that didn't do him
any good. Yeah. So then

190
00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:18.470
one of your, one of
your guys that was helping

191
00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:21.710
me out with this said,
well, why don't you link

192
00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:24.710
the address to a mobile
version of a map site?

193
00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.320
Exact. So I ended up
linking into the mobile version

194
00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:29.960
of live.com where then he
could find his way to

195
00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.840
the thing. Excellent. And then
another guy said, well, I

196
00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:35.120
saw your phone number there,
but I couldn't click on

197
00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:37.100
it. Yeah. So then I
made that a link that

198
00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:39.020
they could click on that
would cause the phone Call

199
00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:41.630
out except to call link.
Yeah, exactly. So all those

200
00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:45.110
things started making me realize
that is the, I literally

201
00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:48.200
thought I was porting. I
was down porting my desktop

202
00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:52.850
app. You know, I think
that's just it's most people

203
00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:55.100
think damn postings what you're
doing and that's not it

204
00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:58.250
at all. Yeah. Customizing for
this mobile experience and really

205
00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:01.610
taking advantage of what a
phone provides. It's in my

206
00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:03.710
pocket all the time. I
have it with me. So

207
00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:06.320
they use this scenario as
a slightly different, how do

208
00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:08.060
I get, how do I
get to where I need

209
00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:11.180
to go? So very common
scenario and then it's, well,

210
00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:13.250
how do I speed that
up? Because every click on

211
00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:17.170
a mobile phone takes a
long time, mobile data connections

212
00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:20.300
is still quite clunky. So
minimize the clicks and give

213
00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:22.250
me the data fast. Right.
Right. And it's interesting. And

214
00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:23.750
what, well, one of the
things that's frustrating is that

215
00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:26.240
a guy with a phone
in the head GPS visited

216
00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:29.750
nerdina.com and it introduces him
to a box that says

217
00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:32.030
where and a button. And
he says, well, my phone

218
00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:35.570
knows where I am. Yeah.
Why can't your application? Figure

219
00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:39.110
that out. And I don't
know the state of geolocation

220
00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:41.390
and browsers and stuff. So
I was like, well maybe

221
00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:43.610
there's some JavaScript I could
call. I mean, are we

222
00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:48.470
getting that stuff straightened out
yet? I would. Yes. I

223
00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:51.680
mean, there's some great W3C
standards right now. It's just

224
00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:55.420
going through the pipe are
gonna provide web developers for

225
00:11:55.420 --> 00:12:00.250
JavaScript access to location information.
So some really great location

226
00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:03.490
stuff coming through in the
pipeline. It's not there quite

227
00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:05.370
yet. I see. But soon
I'm gonna be able to

228
00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:07.980
fill out that box for
him. You think? I, I,

229
00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:10.950
I think so. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Another thing that I

230
00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:12.900
thought was interesting that I'm
still getting my head around

231
00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:17.490
is that the live site
uses a very interactive scrollable

232
00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:20.490
virtual earth map. But then
the mobile one, I haven't

233
00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:23.010
figured out yet how to
request a static version of

234
00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:25.860
the map. Really. I know
that it's possible, but that's,

235
00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:28.770
it, it also changed the
interaction model because in the

236
00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:31.050
live site you interact with
them app and on the

237
00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:33.360
mobile one, I would just
really want to generate a

238
00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:36.810
graphic of a map. Yes.
So send that down. It's

239
00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:40.050
excited, slight to slightly different
use of the same technology.

240
00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:43.800
So I'm going to continue
to kind of add on

241
00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:46.470
to that. But so far
I've made an iPhone version,

242
00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:49.260
a windows mobile version, and
then kind of an other

243
00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:53.100
where other is as simple
as possible. Yeah. I've seen

244
00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:55.590
it running on my, in
95. It was pretty. So

245
00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:57.750
you got to know Kia.
Yeah. Right. And that worked

246
00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:59.970
okay. I did. Yeah. Now
one of the things that

247
00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:01.770
was a, it was interesting.
Cause I, I put it

248
00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:03.990
up on the wind mobile
and I called a guy

249
00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:06.060
who had a windmill wants,
said, check this out. And

250
00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:09.090
he ended up with a
scroll bar that went horizontally

251
00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:12.090
way, way, way, way off
in the corner. And my

252
00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:14.640
buttons were incredibly wide and
everything like that. And he

253
00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:16.950
said, well, there's this notion
of a viewport, what's the

254
00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:20.580
deal with this viewport meta
information. So it turns out

255
00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:23.280
that there was a series
of meta-tags you can put

256
00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:25.530
on a mobile device that
they listen to. This it's

257
00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:30.150
sits exists inside of your,
your head that says the

258
00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:32.190
portion of the view that
I want you to show

259
00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:34.650
in the area where scroll
bar should start and stop

260
00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:37.860
is is here. This is
where your file came in

261
00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:40.410
to place. Yep. So I
got to say request dot

262
00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:42.840
browser, and then I could
treat it as a dictionary

263
00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:47.340
and say screen width. Yes.
Screen height. And this particular

264
00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:49.890
device was a three 20
by two 40. So I

265
00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:53.250
was able to dynamically write
out this viewport information. And

266
00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:58.230
I took my existing view,
my ASP X page. And

267
00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.140
now I didn't have to
make another whole view. Yeah.

268
00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:03.210
And this was a really
important thing. I thought I

269
00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:06.960
was going to have to
pick five, 10, 12 phones

270
00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:08.520
and make a bunch of
views and test a bunch

271
00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:11.100
of views. Yeah. It turns
out that that default view

272
00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:14.220
can be made richer by
doing a couple of, not

273
00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:17.400
necessarily conditionals, but by saying,
Hey, if, if you know

274
00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:21.030
your width and height, I
can help make things. Excellent.

275
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:22.770
Yeah. And that's a great
use of the data that

276
00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:24.660
we provide because that's how
you intend that kind of

277
00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:27.450
thing to be. And we
also supply not just the

278
00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:30.570
screen width and height, but
we also supply the available

279
00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:33.180
browse width and height is
slightly different because we take

280
00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:36.450
into account that some browsers,
for instance, and some handsets

281
00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:39.150
we'll put in a title
bar at the top, which

282
00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:42.450
consumes some spaces. You know,
that's interesting because by default,

283
00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:43.980
I ended up with a
chest, a little bit of

284
00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:46.230
a vertical scroll bar. There
we go. I need to

285
00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:49.530
switch that to available. How
do you collect all of

286
00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:50.910
this? I mean, it, you
just have a bunch of,

287
00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:53.270
a lot of, I mean,
that's a lot, it's a

288
00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:56.110
ridiculous amount of data. There's
a huge amount of data

289
00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:58.540
and we collect it from
various sources. So we have,

290
00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:02.650
we take data in from
waterfall. You take data, the

291
00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:05.960
second person you mentioned Warfield.
Yeah. So talk to me

292
00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:09.340
about, about what that is,
is a, an open source

293
00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:15.160
supplier of device data information,
and it has thousands of

294
00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:18.550
devices listed on it. And
that information is freely available

295
00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:20.020
to anybody can come along
and pick it up and

296
00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:24.370
use it. We consume that.
What we've found though, is

297
00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:27.640
that in our experience, some
of the data that's in

298
00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:30.700
there hasn't been as accurate
as it could be just

299
00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:32.590
been entered wrong or somebody
who's taken a guess and

300
00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:37.390
some capability values. We combine
that in a database internally

301
00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:43.420
with data from UA profile.
So device manufacturers, when they

302
00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:46.960
release a new device, put
up an XML schema, which

303
00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:51.940
describes what that device is
and its browse capabilities. The

304
00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:56.230
profile means user agent profile.
Yeah. And as a device

305
00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:58.660
makes a request to a
web server, it includes the

306
00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:01.810
link, the URL to where
you can find that UAE

307
00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:03.960
profile that XML fine. Where
is that? Is that man?

308
00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:06.970
The header that's in the
HTTP header. Yeah. Really The

309
00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:09.640
mobile devices are, all of
them are good ones, good

310
00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:12.700
ones, good ones include data
about themselves. Yes. So then

311
00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:14.410
you can find that when
you log the headers and

312
00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:16.990
go look and say, well,
I've never seen it. Yeah.

313
00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:20.590
So we, we log headers
from windows live and we

314
00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:22.960
can see the UI profiles
that come in. We take

315
00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:26.920
that UAE profile. We go
along and get that information

316
00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:29.440
and put that into a
database. I mean, obviously you

317
00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:32.410
could, if you really wanted
to go away and make

318
00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:35.680
a request at the time
you get the request in

319
00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:37.840
for the handset, make that
request to the URL, pull

320
00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:39.700
down the exponent, pass it.
But it's just not, yeah.

321
00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:42.040
That wouldn't make any sense.
Yeah. You'd just be wasting

322
00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:46.090
time. Yeah. As an academic
exercise, it might be interesting,

323
00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:48.430
but That's cool. So you're
consuming information from this one

324
00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:50.680
open source project, combining it
with data of your own

325
00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:52.870
from various sources and then
releasing it again as, as

326
00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:55.180
open source. Yeah. We get,
we also get input from,

327
00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:58.060
from carriers. Some of the
operators will come into us

328
00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:00.910
and say, Hey, we're releasing
a new device. We need

329
00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:04.750
to, we need it. We
would love a Hotmail to

330
00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:07.660
work well on it. Love
I am to work well

331
00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:09.490
on it. So we go
away and try and customize

332
00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:11.980
for that. Now I bumped
into a very interesting edge

333
00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:15.790
case that I think is
not necessarily a completely interesting

334
00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:18.310
as an edge case, but
interesting because it's representative of

335
00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:19.690
the kind of things that
are going on under the

336
00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:24.040
covers. I was trying to
use the W3C validator to

337
00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:28.180
find out about my, my
desktop site. And it told

338
00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:32.260
me, which is an ex
H XHTML strict site, but

339
00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:35.380
the validators that I was
ex HTML basic, that's it,

340
00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:38.140
that's strange. The only thing
I have that's XHTML basic

341
00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:41.380
is my mobile site. Well,
it turns out that one

342
00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:44.170
of the devices, I think
it's a Nokia six Oh

343
00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:48.850
six. Yep. Happens to use
a very greedy, regular expression

344
00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:51.630
that says if the number
six Oh six appears anywhere

345
00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:54.720
in the user agent. Yes.
That's a Nokia. Well, a

346
00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:57.570
couple of days ago, apparently
the WTC validator got rev

347
00:17:57.570 --> 00:18:02.160
to version 1.0 0.606. So
now the validator shows up

348
00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:05.280
as a Nokia device. I
think that's a really interesting

349
00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:09.030
problem because you have to
find some aspect of the,

350
00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:13.890
of the signature, the fingerprint
that you can identify. That's

351
00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:20.330
a Nokia, that's a Samsung.
Yes. So the, the dot

352
00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:24.080
browser file itself is made
up of regular expressions like

353
00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:26.060
you were saying, right. And
it's a node basis, a

354
00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:28.460
tree structure. Right. So based
on the outcome of a

355
00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:31.730
regular expression, determines what way
you flow down that path.

356
00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:34.640
And by building this up,
we have this set of

357
00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:37.660
capabilities. So we're able to
determine if we can determine

358
00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:40.310
first on the handset and
then on the browser. Right.

359
00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:42.500
So it could be a
windows mobile device that's running

360
00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:45.830
opera or windows mobile device
is running. I E so

361
00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:47.990
we'd have the base set
of capabilities for the screen,

362
00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:50.000
width and height, but that's
not going to change. Right.

363
00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:53.480
But the browser characteristics will
change so we can build

364
00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:56.150
it up. And we use
the UAA string as the

365
00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:58.790
key for this, because it
contains both pieces of information.

366
00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:01.460
Right. I we'd love to
say that we're a hundred

367
00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:03.770
percent accurate all the time.
Yeah. But we're not, I

368
00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:05.990
mean, it's a tough job.
Well, it's a tough job

369
00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:09.620
because you, you naively one
would think that, Oh, well

370
00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:11.360
this is just a key
and a hash table somewhere.

371
00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:15.500
Yeah. But UAA strings are
freeform. People have tried to

372
00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:18.050
say, well, here's the segment
for platform and here's the

373
00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:20.570
segment for this. And then
they, then now they've become,

374
00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:24.200
you know, paranthetically instead of
parents medicals with, you know,

375
00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:28.640
semicolon, delimited payers, that's quite
a bit of mess parse.

376
00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:33.260
One of the interesting things
that we found we found

377
00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:36.980
also is that web crawlers
have started to identify themselves

378
00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:39.800
as mobile because Hey, you
know, I can crawl the

379
00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:41.960
web and I'm not getting
as much data back. Oh

380
00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:46.880
no. So that too poses
some interesting. Yeah. That's interesting

381
00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:50.510
because I, in my down
porting exercise, present, you know,

382
00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:54.470
possibly less information. Yeah. So
if, if a web crawler

383
00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:56.660
starts showing up and they
inadvertently get that, that's going

384
00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:58.790
to be an interesting thing.
And here I am now

385
00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:01.310
sniffing to give the user
the best experience, but I've

386
00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:04.190
just realized that I don't
know what Google or live

387
00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:07.070
or act.com is going to
see yeah. When they show

388
00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:08.960
up. So that means that
I need to do testing

389
00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:13.400
using known user agent strings
of popular spiders, which I'm

390
00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:15.260
sure that you do. Yes,
we do. But this is

391
00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:16.880
kind of a, it sounds
like a mobile best practice.

392
00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:21.260
Yes. Yeah. So we, we
do have some very strict

393
00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:24.740
constraints around what we put
into this, this file. And

394
00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:26.120
we make a good effort
to make sure that we

395
00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:30.680
don't include, or we exclude
deliberately exclude the crawlers. What

396
00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:32.870
do you think of best
practices with regard to the

397
00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:36.950
sub domains? It seems that
kind of spontaneously the world

398
00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:40.340
has decided that m.whatever.com is
a good way to get

399
00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:43.130
to a mobile site. Well,
that's an interesting question. Cause

400
00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:47.180
I just had a conversation
with.mobi who have the.mobi extension

401
00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:51.350
and they would, they're like
a people. Yeah. Yeah. They

402
00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:54.040
are. They're a group of
consortium. They're, they're a company

403
00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:57.190
they're also based in Dublin.
Oh really? So they manage

404
00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:00.320
the.mobi top level in Ireland,
not Dublin, Ohio. Yeah. Dublin.

405
00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:05.410
So they manage the.mobi domain
and they would rather that

406
00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:08.800
you use to really, I
wonder why. Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

407
00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:13.290
M dot, whatever.com. It's just
such an elegant Way to

408
00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:17.190
do things, you know, testing
in house. One of the

409
00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:20.220
most annoying things we found
is you create a website

410
00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:21.480
and you need to test
it. And a bunch of

411
00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:25.080
devices just typing in the
URL and the T nine

412
00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:28.530
keyboards can be bit tiresome,
especially if you have to

413
00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:33.030
do it 50 times in
different handsets. So you tiny

414
00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:37.080
URLs come in really handy
for that. Really? The, I

415
00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:41.100
have a wondering if I
should have m.nerdina.com or COVID

416
00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:45.090
Well, it's interesting. Cause you'd
expect your mobile users to

417
00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:46.800
know that they should go
to M dot or would

418
00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:49.920
you automatically redirect? That's an
interesting question. And I think

419
00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:52.290
this is a windows mobile
has, this has this quote

420
00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:56.460
unquote problem. And the iPhone
does too, Where they are

421
00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:58.920
on a street, Wrong device.
They are on a mini

422
00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:02.520
company. Yeah. And often they
know that, okay, They're going

423
00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:07.170
to move more likely to
hit www.something.com. Yeah. I'm noticing

424
00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:10.830
more and more sites that
are detecting and forcing the

425
00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:16.020
user to a particular Experience.
Yes. Self included. I'm realizing

426
00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:18.210
that I haven't figured out
quite what the best practices,

427
00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:19.860
if I should have at
the bottom of my site

428
00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:23.760
view in standard view, in
a mobile. Because right now,

429
00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:26.460
if an iPhone hits my
site, they're stuck. Yes. Locked

430
00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:29.610
down. I will not show
them the desktop. Yep. Well,

431
00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:34.080
on windows, windows, mobile, there's
an option to say, I

432
00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:38.820
am a desktop browser I
experienced. Yeah. Or I'm a

433
00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:42.120
pocket browser. Yeah. Which is
a little more intuitive from

434
00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:45.060
a developer's perspective, but not
something I think my mom

435
00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:48.390
would really care. No, no.
And you know, the soap

436
00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:51.480
was down to what is
the user experience? Not just

437
00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:54.030
the rendered content. What do
you want to provide your

438
00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:56.490
user when he's using it
on a, or she's using

439
00:22:56.490 --> 00:23:00.810
it on a mobile phone?
That's the real key It's

440
00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:03.180
like, what do they want
to do from my point

441
00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:05.850
of view on a nerdier
side, I don't think hosting

442
00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:08.520
a nerd dinner, like the,
the actual initiation of the

443
00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:11.580
hosting of the dinner is
an appropriate mobile thing. Yeah.

444
00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:13.650
So that makes me wonder
on the Hotmail side, what

445
00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:16.260
are some things that you've
decided are not something that

446
00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:19.740
someone would want to do?
So that would really be

447
00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:21.420
a question for the Hotmail
team, but I can give

448
00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:23.340
you some insight. I know.
I realize you're not the

449
00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:25.980
Hotmail team. Yeah. So help
me out kind of canonical

450
00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:28.740
example, well, help miles assist
the team in that they

451
00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:31.770
do sit beside us. And
So other mobile sites that

452
00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:33.510
you think where someone has
said, you know, this is

453
00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:35.670
not the kind of thing
that a mobile user would

454
00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:38.340
want to do or the
experience can't be good. Yeah.

455
00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:41.370
By virtue of the fact
That's mobile. Well, you know,

456
00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:43.950
what's really interesting is the
Twitter site, you check that

457
00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:47.270
out on the mobile Twitter
site. So it provides some

458
00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:51.800
really good, really strong scenarios
for mobile stuff. So I

459
00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:53.780
can read messages really quickly
and I can create a

460
00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:57.620
new message, but I can't
search. Yep. Which sucks. And

461
00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:01.190
you couldn't do replies for
the longest time, which was

462
00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:04.510
It's mobile people. A lot
of mobile people are not

463
00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:06.880
using Twitter apps yet, you
know? Yeah. They find the

464
00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:09.520
site is so light Wait.
And in fact, come on,

465
00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:11.530
it's been a year. Can
we look at our replies?

466
00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:14.800
Yes, exactly. And now, now
of course we have replies

467
00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:17.680
and now we want search.
Yep. Be some technical reason

468
00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:19.960
for not doing that. Or
the experience can't Be a

469
00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:22.780
good one or perhaps they've
just not completed the deep

470
00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:27.370
experience. But in general, what
we've found for mobile scenarios

471
00:24:27.370 --> 00:24:31.120
is the input method on
a mobile phone right now.

472
00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:33.850
Isn't great. Even on the
iPhone, you're not going to

473
00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:36.400
write an essay using that
touch screen. It's a good

474
00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:38.890
user experience, but it's not,
not nothing you're going to

475
00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:41.980
sit and write or a
piece on. Right. Is it

476
00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:46.600
also tabbing tech quote unquote
tabbing between Yeah. To move

477
00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:50.530
between fields is difficult. Yes.
So what people are using

478
00:24:50.530 --> 00:24:53.950
the phones for is reading
and consuming content and trying

479
00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:57.490
to quickly access that content.
So that's more important than

480
00:24:57.490 --> 00:25:01.780
being able to input long
messages. So Twitter is great

481
00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:04.930
because you're constrained by the
text message, length information. So

482
00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:08.530
it's a good fit for
a mobile phone. But what

483
00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:10.390
I'm interested in when I
go to Twitter would probably

484
00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:12.070
be, I want to read
my messages. I want to

485
00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:13.870
quickly search my messages and
I don't want to have

486
00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:17.380
to type because typing is
painful. So the last number

487
00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:20.410
of clicks I've got the
better. Yeah. And if I've

488
00:25:20.410 --> 00:25:22.840
got to do a web
refresh for a full page

489
00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:26.740
refresh, that's bad as painful
because the data connection's going

490
00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:28.390
to be slow and I'm
going to wait for the

491
00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:32.050
reply. And you know, I'm
on a mobile phone, I'm

492
00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:34.300
in a rush, I'm stuck
in traffic. I'm trying to

493
00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:36.040
get to an, a dinner.
I don't know where it

494
00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:38.860
is. And I'm trying to
type on the keyboard. Yeah.

495
00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:41.200
Well certainly I don't know
why you're texting while driving.

496
00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:44.200
Oh, well I've seen, I
never do that. You know,

497
00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:46.120
it's one of the things
also that's interesting is these,

498
00:25:46.150 --> 00:25:48.820
these interactions with what the
expectation is when I click

499
00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:50.680
on a link, I know
there's a lot of people

500
00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:54.040
who feel very strongly that
they don't like it. IPhone

501
00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:59.980
will intercept a link to
Google maps You out of

502
00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:03.430
the browser and into Google
maps. Yeah. They actually see

503
00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:06.100
that. Yeah. So some people
would say, you know, pragmatist

504
00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:08.230
might say, well, this is
a great experience. That's what

505
00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:11.110
the user would expect while
a purist might say, no,

506
00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:12.910
we should be going to
a tiny map site and

507
00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:15.250
they should be given the
choice. And then also these

508
00:26:15.250 --> 00:26:18.280
a T L colon slash
slash links where someone can

509
00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:20.200
say, well, I want to
know Good call. Yeah. Click

510
00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:22.570
to call links. Okay. Is
that a standard or does

511
00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:26.380
someone just decide one day
Tel colon Wacker call two

512
00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:30.580
was going to be something.
Yeah. Protocol. It is a

513
00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:33.730
mobile standard CS. You will
see that. Okay. So someone

514
00:26:33.730 --> 00:26:36.790
decided that yeah. I've always
decided to someone or did

515
00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:38.830
someone just come out and
do it? I think it's

516
00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:45.600
probably general general agreement. It's
defacto staff. Yeah. So it,

517
00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:48.750
you know, the clinical, stuff's
just so useful. I mean,

518
00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:51.450
you know, the old Nakia
browse is on series 40,

519
00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:55.290
for instance, would try to
PrePass the website and work

520
00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:57.420
out. It was look, there's
a string of numbers. It's

521
00:26:57.420 --> 00:26:59.970
probably a telephone number, your
account number for your bank.

522
00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:02.370
You can now call it.
Yeah, exactly. That's really useful.

523
00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:06.090
So why don't I introduce
the tail tag? So it's

524
00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:08.700
a H ref tail and
then your mobile number or

525
00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:10.650
whatever number you want. Right.
And you can have a

526
00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:12.990
name associated with it now.
So I can say Scott,

527
00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:15.210
call Scott, click this button.
Really? How do you do

528
00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:19.710
that? Well, it's just use
a tag tail, put it

529
00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:21.990
in. And then his label
for the tail you put

530
00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:24.480
in. So it doesn't have
to be a number shown

531
00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:26.670
on the screen. It can
be a person's name or

532
00:27:26.790 --> 00:27:29.490
that's a restaurant that you're
going to meet at. Are

533
00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:31.420
there any other ones, other
ones like SMS, colon or

534
00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:35.060
something? I think there is.
Yeah. Huh. Now where can

535
00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:38.870
people find this information? Because
I'm not a mobile expert,

536
00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:40.730
but if I want to
start getting better at this,

537
00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:43.010
do I just spend time
with the W3C? Is that

538
00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:47.390
I would recommend starting there?
Yes. They have. W3C has

539
00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:52.160
some great mobile recommendations, best
practices for web development. That'd

540
00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:56.030
be a great starting place,
but really once you've got

541
00:27:56.030 --> 00:27:58.400
the basics down and you
know, the rough standards that

542
00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:01.250
are out there, the real
key is this user scenario.

543
00:28:01.670 --> 00:28:05.300
Cause this, these clicks take
forever, really take them away.

544
00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:08.960
So really focusing on the
experience, not down porting it,

545
00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:11.300
I had as I have,
but thinking about how will

546
00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:13.100
they interact with this and
how can I save them?

547
00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:17.060
Yeah. And the material you
see in the web mainly

548
00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:22.490
concentrates on let's, let's really
think about a seamless user

549
00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:26.690
interface, making this really slick,
really smooth and a couple

550
00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:31.220
of very good key scenarios.
And I think that's something

551
00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:34.400
you see Apple do a
lot in their products. There's

552
00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:36.140
one way to do something
and they do it really

553
00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:40.550
well. But if you wanted
to add options and change

554
00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:42.740
things, or it's not quite
the way you want to

555
00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:45.620
do it often doesn't work
out. So good. So where

556
00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:48.800
can I go on code
Plex to get this MTBF

557
00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:54.020
copex.com DBF. So it's a
mobile browser data file. M

558
00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:57.050
D B f.copex.com. I hope
so. And we can get

559
00:28:57.050 --> 00:28:59.240
that right now and we
can bring that into our

560
00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:02.090
applications and I'm going to
put a post up. That'll

561
00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:04.040
be up by the time
you're listening to this show,

562
00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:08.030
explaining how to use this
on a NSF MVC. And

563
00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:10.250
I'm sure there'll be some
samples out there for web

564
00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:13.220
forums as well, to explain
how to use this. Yeah.

565
00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:15.500
Just go up to our
complex site. You can download

566
00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:18.260
this file and use it
in your applications today. We'd

567
00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:22.130
love to get feedback, like,
like knock Eric six Oh

568
00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:25.550
six example. Yep. We're not
always a hundred percent. Let

569
00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:27.890
us know. So you'll take
the feedback and issues and,

570
00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:29.630
and patches and stuff and
you'll do something with it.

571
00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:32.540
Yeah. We will. We, we
plan to roll out updates

572
00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:34.580
to this file, but it
will be based on community

573
00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:36.710
feedback. So if somebody in
the community is using this

574
00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:39.650
file and we've got something
wrong, if you tell us,

575
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:41.680
we'll do our best to
update it and get any

576
00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:43.990
release Out. Cool. And then
where can, where's the main

577
00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:46.690
place for mobile people to
get into the, the live

578
00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:54.850
mobile platform, mobile.life.com mobile.live.com, not
M dot line, I guess,

579
00:29:55.090 --> 00:29:57.070
mobile. That likes to come.
All right. Well, thanks so

580
00:29:57.070 --> 00:29:59.800
much, Chris, for talking to
me today about, about mobile

581
00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:02.740
and making it better. This
has been another episode of

582
00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:10.450
Hansel minutes. We'll see you
again next week. <inaudible>.
