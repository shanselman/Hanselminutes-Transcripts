00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.370
From hanselminutes.com. It's Hanselman. Oh,
weekly discussion with web developer

2
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:21.570
and technologists. Scott Hanselman. This
is Lawrence Ryan announcing show number

3
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.060
308. Recorded live Thursday, March 1st, 2012.
Support for Hanselman it's. This

4
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.570
provided by Telerik rad controls,
the most comprehensive suite of

5
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:39.600
components for windows forms and
asp.net web applications online@wwwdottelerik.com. In

6
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.780
this episode, Scott talks with
Corey Haynes about pairing with

7
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:49.550
other developers and software craftsmanship,
Scott Hanselman. This is another

8
00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.430
episode of Hansel minutes, and
I am talking today with

9
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.170
software journeymen, Corey Haynes. How
are you, sir? Good. Excellent.

10
00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.070
How are you, Scott? I
am very well. So I

11
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.960
wanted to talk to you
because of a couple of

12
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.170
things that you call yourself,
the software journeymen. And I

13
00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.320
just love that because craftsmanship
is a word that I

14
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.290
personally use all the time
to refer to what I

15
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.470
think has kind of been
lost in software. The idea

16
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.000
that we don't have this
apprenticeship journeyman master kind of

17
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.790
process, I feel sometimes like
it's harder to become a

18
00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.310
plumber or a certified electrician
than it is to become

19
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.600
a software developer. Yeah, it's
pretty much, if you can

20
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.470
type into a computer, you
have the rights to say

21
00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.250
you're a software developer. Is
that okay? I mean, should

22
00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.440
there, should, should it be
harder? Should people put the

23
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.810
kind of effort that you're
putting into this and that

24
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.620
you encourage people to put
into their craft? I think

25
00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.230
so. I'm not, I'm not
a hundred percent sure how

26
00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.200
to go about doing it,
but it does make sense,

27
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.920
especially as software becomes so
prevalent in our lives and

28
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.560
it's, you know, it's in
pretty much everything. It's in

29
00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.800
our cars, it's in the
medical devices, it's in planes,

30
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.520
you know, the quality of
code that we generally see

31
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.950
when we go around that
both we write and everybody

32
00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.700
writes is it's frightening. If
you think about it in

33
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.680
terms of this is running
our lives and this is

34
00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.770
saving our lives. And you
know, if a pacemaker goes

35
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.480
under, what's going to happen.
Well, I hope that people

36
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.030
who work for the pacemaker
company or myself as someone

37
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.220
with an insulin pump that
has never had it software

38
00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.260
crash. I hope that the
people who are writing that

39
00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.390
kind of software have some
qualifications, but I, you know,

40
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.880
other than things like ACM
and I Tripoli and different

41
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.880
organizations, there's really no way
to know other than looking

42
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.210
at someone's resume, whether or
not there's, they've gone through

43
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:46.220
that process. They've, they've really
honed their craft. Yeah. And

44
00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.760
it's difficult. And we've had
a couple sort of starts

45
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.460
at it of people talk
about having it be sort

46
00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.030
of very reference-based or trust-based,
or, you know, a couple

47
00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.760
of websites that popped up
before of, you know, I

48
00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.930
vouch this person, but it's
a very difficult, they get

49
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.920
gamed very easily and people
just, they tend to only

50
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.810
be looked at by developers
and that's, that's more difficult

51
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.300
to get it out into
the world so people can

52
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.540
understand how do you hire
a software developer? How do

53
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.930
you gauge what their skill
level is? And it's something

54
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.080
that, you know, is inactive
conversation right now, but we

55
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.790
stay away so much from
the idea of an external

56
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.810
certification board, because it's, it's
difficult to say, like in

57
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.710
electricity, there's some, there's some
fundamentals that most everybody agree

58
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.880
upon, but in software, we're
at the stage where there's

59
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:45.340
still discussion about certain fundamentals
that I think shouldn't be

60
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.150
argued anymore, but we still
argue about them and we

61
00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.930
still discuss them. So it's
hard to say here's an

62
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.430
external certification board when you
can't even agree amongst yourselves.

63
00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.380
What are the fundamentals of
development? I wonder if, you

64
00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.990
know, there's, there's been books
on software architecture that have

65
00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.120
drawn long and extended analogies
with software design, with a

66
00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.330
building design, you know, and
they, they do, you know,

67
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.670
I read a couple of
books, I forgot the name

68
00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.250
of the one, but it's,
it's basically, you know, 150

69
00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.380
pages, 200 pages drawing, direct
correlation between construct, shop software

70
00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.060
construction and actual construction. I
think that buildings, you know,

71
00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.740
and how do you put
up a building and these

72
00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.150
kinds of things, how do
you put up a building

73
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.720
without a collapsing are pretty
well understood? Is that because

74
00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.390
we've got 2000 years of
practice and with software we've

75
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:39.720
really only got maybe 50
to a hundred years. Yeah,

76
00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.810
I think so. And it's,
we're still, we also have

77
00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.380
a problem of not carrying
on knowledge from generation to

78
00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.950
generation. So we have a
tendency for people to come

79
00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:53.730
into it without a good
introduction, a good way of

80
00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.750
learning from the people that
came before us and in

81
00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:03.090
software, it's, it's similar to
like bridge building or something

82
00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.660
like that, except for the
fact that the actual construction

83
00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.970
phase is pretty much instantaneous.
So you can know the,

84
00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.870
the actual going out and
physically constructing the bridge is

85
00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.200
like a compiler. And we
have, I mean, that's, we

86
00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.180
can do that over and
over again. So if you

87
00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.780
think about how your, how
you would go about building

88
00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.830
a house, if you could
rebuild it physically every morning,

89
00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:33.630
you would most likely go
into a very iterative development

90
00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:38.010
cycle because you could change
the blueprint, click a button,

91
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.280
and suddenly you have another
room. And if you don't

92
00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.370
like that room, you change
the blueprint. And it's like,

93
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.680
Oh, now I have this
different room. Now that my

94
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.160
bedrooms on the second floor,
and we don't have a

95
00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.960
really great sense of how
to adjust to that. Glenn

96
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.520
Vanderburg had a, has a
talk that he gave, I

97
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.010
think last year at a
couple places called real software

98
00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:06.170
engineering, where he took apart
sort of what engineering is

99
00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.620
took apart, what software development
looks like and kind of

100
00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.540
put it back together and
said, you know, there are

101
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:17.000
analogies, but it really is
a, a different type of

102
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.190
thing from most physical engineering
disciplines. And it's a fam

103
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.750
it's fantastic speech. It gets
me thinking about layers of

104
00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:29.470
abstraction. Like I think I'm
a, not a hardware person,

105
00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:32.170
but I'm pretty well. I
pretty much understand that the

106
00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:34.630
folks that are making Silicon
right now pretty much understand

107
00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:37.390
how it should be done.
And as you start moving

108
00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:40.600
up the stack, you know,
machine language and assembly language,

109
00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.780
and C and all these
kinds of things, the higher

110
00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:46.270
up you get, the more
likely we are to disagree

111
00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:48.790
about stuff, but at the
funding, you know, certain fundamentals,

112
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:50.950
we agree upon. I find
it kind of interesting that,

113
00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:53.470
that, you know, Intel and
AMD and all the different

114
00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:58.300
folks that make processors mostly
agree on how to do

115
00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.990
hardware design and feel OSI.
But we are up at

116
00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:04.450
the top here. We're going
to floating above the, you

117
00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:06.760
know, standing on the shoulders
of giants. Can't agree how

118
00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:12.490
to do a proper crud
implementation. That just seems so,

119
00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:16.870
so ironic. Yeah. Yeah. And
I think it's a lot

120
00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:20.470
because of the fact that
we don't, we don't really

121
00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:23.320
kind of learn from the
stuff that's gone before. So

122
00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:26.770
I think it was Jason
Gorman put out on Twitter

123
00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:31.120
the other day that he's
sad that he reads all

124
00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:34.240
of these papers from the
early seventies and spends all

125
00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:36.520
of his time shaking his
head saying, yes, that's how

126
00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:40.840
it should be done. And
we're just now rediscovering these

127
00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:44.080
principles. We keep discovering them.
We keep going through these

128
00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:47.980
things rather than really just
stopping and saying, what is

129
00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:52.900
it that we were discovered
before? There's my favorite paper

130
00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:57.400
is a Parnussas paper on
the deconstruction of modules or

131
00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:00.640
the decomposition of modules. And
he goes in and talks

132
00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:07.180
about decomposing systems based on
task versus layer. And they

133
00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:10.180
find that a layered system
is a much more effective

134
00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:15.970
way for obtaining both incidental
reuse and intentional reuse than

135
00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:18.820
building up what would, what
we would consider like an

136
00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:24.490
object graph based on responsibility.
And, and it's back in

137
00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:27.880
the, back in the seventies
that he wrote this paper,

138
00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:33.340
I'm looking at Jason Gorman's
Twitter feed, and he has

139
00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:37.570
a wonderful re retweet from
our Tyler Croy, who says,

140
00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:41.020
let's all argue about whether
Haskell or closure is better

141
00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.540
while someone else ships a
product with the PA Duct

142
00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:48.680
tape. Yeah. Yeah. I saw
that. The one thing that

143
00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:53.170
I find important about those
sorts of comparisons though, is

144
00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:57.990
that there is an important
of more of academic discussions

145
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:03.600
that eventually lead into the
more production oriented things. Like

146
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:08.190
I, I use almost exclusively
Ruby on rails for my

147
00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:13.110
web application development, because it
is so incredibly productive for

148
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:16.380
me. And there's a lot
of issues with it. There's

149
00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:18.780
a lot of problems with
it. And, you know, last

150
00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:21.960
year I was giving some
talks on sort of extracting

151
00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:26.040
out your actual business code
from the rails framework itself,

152
00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:31.290
but it's still so incredibly
productive to use. And, but

153
00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:35.760
it's important to have those
sort of very theoretical discussions

154
00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:40.980
about design and about languages,
because those are the things

155
00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:45.510
that come eventually come into
real production work. And we,

156
00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:50.670
we start to get a
better understanding of how to

157
00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:54.270
best apply it. And the,
the idea of getting something

158
00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:58.860
into production very, very quickly
is one thing. But I've

159
00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:05.850
seen several companies that have
significant problems startups because their

160
00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:10.860
code base is so not
malleable. It's so like rigid,

161
00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:13.860
and you can't go in
and fix issues. You can't

162
00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:16.800
go in there and move
at the pace that businesses

163
00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:20.250
really do need to move
at. And we hear a

164
00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:25.380
lot about companies that succeed
despite their messy code basis,

165
00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:30.930
but I do advising for
tech technical advising for nontechnical

166
00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:36.000
founders of startups, and we
see time. And again, the

167
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.870
effect that a bad code
base can have. And I

168
00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:44.070
think that the academic discussions
about design and languages do

169
00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:49.710
influence how we work in
our actual, like productive production

170
00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:52.680
languages. Not that those languages
aren't productive. I know people

171
00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:57.740
doing great stuff in closure
and that area Well, but

172
00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:01.280
even to talk about something
like, like Haskell or closure

173
00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:05.570
is immediately kind of excluding
the available pool of talent

174
00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:08.750
down to like the top
one or 2%. And then

175
00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:10.970
you, I think you start
getting into discussions about kind

176
00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:14.210
of like the software haves
and have nots, you know,

177
00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:18.170
like the, the, the, the
pragmatist versus the purist or

178
00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:22.880
the academic versus the non
academic arguments are interesting, but

179
00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:26.090
it also brings up the
question that is it possible

180
00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:29.300
for us to kind of
raise the discourse and raise

181
00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:32.720
the discussion around software development
when maybe the talent pool

182
00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:35.750
is just still interested in
slapping this stuff together? I

183
00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:37.730
mean, I wrote a blog
post a while back called

184
00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:40.550
a five Oh one developer,
and this is the developer.

185
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:42.620
Who's like, you know, Hey
man, it's five Oh one,

186
00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:45.860
can I punch out? And
it wasn't meant to imply

187
00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:47.720
that people should work long
hours, but it was more

188
00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:50.690
about the attitude of like,
you know, Hey, I'm gonna,

189
00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:52.670
I gotta get outta here.
I got a soccer thing

190
00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:54.760
later know, can we just
compile this and ship it?

191
00:11:56.340 --> 00:12:00.510
Yeah. I call those accounting
developers because we tend not

192
00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:05.610
to go into the accounting
department and derived the accountants

193
00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:11.550
for not going home and
doing accounting. You know, it's,

194
00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:16.890
there is a valid place
for people who do software

195
00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:21.060
development as a job, as
a skilled job. It's not

196
00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:25.200
their passion, it's not their
hobby. And, you know, there's

197
00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.480
this place for it. There's
a place where that is

198
00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:31.080
not appropriate. Like, I, I
think that small businesses that

199
00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:34.560
need to move very quickly,
that's not an appropriate place

200
00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:38.880
for that mentality, but in
companies where the software is

201
00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:43.620
not the main thing that's
driving their business, there's, you

202
00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:48.060
know, I, my last big
job was there were tons

203
00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:50.120
of people. There were, you
know, I think a couple

204
00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:53.460
thousand developers, and there were
a lot of people there

205
00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:55.920
who came in, they did
their job. They didn't write

206
00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:59.040
the greatest of code. You
know, there was there's times

207
00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:02.370
when it caused problems, but
it got done and it,

208
00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:05.280
and it worked for the
most part. And they had

209
00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:09.780
processes in place to make
sure that really, really bad

210
00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:11.970
stuff didn't make it into
production. I mean, stuff that

211
00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:15.750
made it into production more
or less worked. And so

212
00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:20.400
there were processes in place
to take advantage of the

213
00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:24.360
masses of people who do
have that attitude. And while

214
00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.490
it's not the most effective,
and it's not the most

215
00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:30.930
efficient, it's, it is a,
there is a level of

216
00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:35.340
effectiveness there. And I think
it's worth treating that as

217
00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:39.480
a, you know, as valuable.
And then there's a, I

218
00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:42.510
think there is a place
for the discussions, the very

219
00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:48.930
highly theoretical discussions or discussions
of we are going to

220
00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:53.130
be so incredibly fast and
productive in the long run.

221
00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:55.500
So we're going to build
systems in such a way

222
00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:58.950
that over the course of
the years, they don't get,

223
00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:02.400
you know, they don't calcify.
We can still add features

224
00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:08.520
very easily, and those places
might be considered exclusionary to

225
00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:13.290
the other type of developer,
but that's okay. As long

226
00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:16.620
as it's not considered, this
is the best way, or

227
00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:19.860
this is the only way
to do it. I generally

228
00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:22.890
tell people that I consider
there to be several software

229
00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:26.910
industries and they each have
their different focuses and they

230
00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:30.300
each have their different value
that they provide to places.

231
00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:34.200
And you just have to
find the one that suits

232
00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:37.230
you best, you know, large
scale corporate work was not,

233
00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:39.480
you know, I did it
for quite a while, but

234
00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.600
after a while it just
did it. I realized it

235
00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:46.560
wasn't the place for me.
And when you did that,

236
00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:49.050
when you decided that that
wasn't for you, as I

237
00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:52.070
understand it, you kind of
went on walkabout. You just

238
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:54.170
said, all right, I'm leaving.
I'm going to go and

239
00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:58.010
learn about software the way
that feeds my spirit. What

240
00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:01.390
did you, what did you,
Yeah, so I, when I

241
00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:03.760
left the corporate job, I
started at a small startup

242
00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:06.760
for about seven months that
wasn't a cultural fit for

243
00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:08.950
me. So I, I actually
ended up getting fired from

244
00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:14.380
there and then spent nine
months traveling around, working with

245
00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:17.920
people in exchange for room
and board. And so I

246
00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:22.330
traveled around basically in the
Midwest region and then did

247
00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:25.090
a long trip from Cleveland
to Miami, to Prince Edward

248
00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:27.370
Island, back to Cleveland, where
I was living at the

249
00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:30.570
time. And yeah, and I
would spend anywhere from one

250
00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:36.040
day to five days with
a developer, a freelancer, sometimes

251
00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:39.940
with small companies and learn
what they were doing, teach

252
00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:45.160
what I was doing and
just sort of share, you

253
00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:48.910
know, level, figure out what
my level was, increase my

254
00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:51.760
level by having to teach
stuff. And it was a

255
00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:55.570
lot of fun. How do
you coordinate something like that?

256
00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:58.930
I mean, there is kind
of the one could dismiss

257
00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:01.390
that as kind of a
strange hippie, a couch surfing

258
00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:03.940
adventure, but you were actually
reaching out to people that

259
00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:06.340
you wanted to meet, as
well as maybe reaching out

260
00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:09.070
to people who you did
not know already. How do

261
00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:11.020
you convince them that you're
not just some weirdo and

262
00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:13.030
you legitimately have a reason
to hang out with them

263
00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:17.050
and talk? Yeah, I think
it was like a lot

264
00:16:17.050 --> 00:16:20.980
of the coordination was over
Twitter. Cause once it got

265
00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:24.730
word out that I was
doing this, people started contacting

266
00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:27.640
me, asking me to come
in there. I started off

267
00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:31.540
with a couple people that
I knew, and we had

268
00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:34.480
driven to Chicago and spent
about a week with people.

269
00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:37.780
And then another week with
some people that I knew.

270
00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:40.930
So it was, they knew
me, they trusted me. It

271
00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:45.820
wasn't so, so weird there.
And I think one of

272
00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:48.430
the major things that got
the word out was that

273
00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:52.000
I started doing video interviews
with the people that I

274
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.960
stayed with. And so I
think that that got it

275
00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:59.110
out there. People saw me,
people heard me talking to

276
00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:04.090
people and then over time
it just sort of got

277
00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:07.630
it. Didn't sound so strange
anymore to have somebody doing

278
00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:10.330
this. And people would bring
people to be like, Hey,

279
00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:14.260
come in, stay for a
day or two. The big

280
00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:18.760
thing was when, like I
had one guy have me

281
00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:21.610
come in and talk to
his wife about it because

282
00:17:21.610 --> 00:17:25.870
they had two young girls
like, and she was like,

283
00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:28.930
you know, nervous, who's this
weird guy. But it had

284
00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:31.600
turned to help that I
had talked to them and

285
00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:35.500
effectively been nice to them
at the previous Ruby con.

286
00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:39.220
And they, she was like,
Oh, it's that guy. Yeah,

287
00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:41.710
he can come in. And
so I went over there,

288
00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:44.350
stayed a night with them,
ended up playing guitar with

289
00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:48.640
their daughters playing harmonica. I
was, I put a blog

290
00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:50.400
post up it with a
video that this was like

291
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:53.970
the highlight of the whole
thing. But yeah, it was

292
00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:59.520
a lot on Twitter email
and people just once, once

293
00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:03.300
somebody is doing that, it's
not so strange anymore. I

294
00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:08.000
think What can someone, what
can someone listening learn from

295
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.250
that? Who can't necessarily kind
of like pack it up

296
00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:12.650
and then like code and
couch surf their way across

297
00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:16.460
America? Well, one of the
things that I've talked to

298
00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:18.650
people there's been more and
more people who do this

299
00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:22.070
type of thing is if
you can't like you have

300
00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:25.010
a family and all of
that is take a day,

301
00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:27.980
take one day off a
week or take one day

302
00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:31.850
off and go find a
company. You know, most people

303
00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:34.040
have some friends in the
community that work at different

304
00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:37.610
companies say, Hey, I'm going
to take Friday off. I'd

305
00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:41.390
love to come over and
pair with you or find

306
00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:44.510
a regular PAC Fest that
you go to. Like every

307
00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:47.720
Tuesday morning here in Chicago,
we have a thing called

308
00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:50.060
code and coffee, and it's
7:00 AM to 9:00 AM at a

309
00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:53.630
Starbucks. And we get, we
have about 15 to 20

310
00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:55.910
people that come every week
and we just get together

311
00:18:55.910 --> 00:19:00.290
and code and you can
get so much value from

312
00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:03.980
pairing with people that you
don't ordinarily pair with, or

313
00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:08.330
that you don't ordinarily talk
to hear what their, how

314
00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:11.720
did they do software development?
Cause if they're effective and

315
00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:14.450
your effective, and they do
it a little bit differently

316
00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:18.230
than you, then it's worth
looking and seeing what are

317
00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:20.600
they doing and how can
I incorporate some of their

318
00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:24.860
best or their better practices
into my development methodology as

319
00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:29.360
well. Yeah, that's really, it's
really powerful, but you have

320
00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:31.160
to be a kind of
a self starter to do

321
00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:35.150
that. It's funny that you
recommend this because I I've

322
00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:37.310
recommended this similar thing. I
get, you know, I get

323
00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:41.000
emails from people who say
that, you know, I live

324
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.040
in such and such an
area and there's not a

325
00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:45.470
user group that speaks to
me in this area. I

326
00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:47.810
feel alone. I feel like
I'm doing all this work

327
00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:50.810
by myself. And I think
to myself, well, I live

328
00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:53.540
in a tiny little town
in rural Oregon, and I'm

329
00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:56.240
pairing with people all the
time. I, you need to

330
00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:58.130
get out there and get
out there. It could be

331
00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:01.520
pairing over Skype. It could
be finding the one other

332
00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:03.470
coder in your town and
hanging out with them at

333
00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:06.650
Starbucks, or it could be
forgetting about a user group

334
00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:09.770
and just finding another company
that's not in a competitive

335
00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:12.920
area and sitting with them
and brainstorming this. There's such

336
00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:16.130
a value in that. It's
surprising more people don't find

337
00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:20.720
that to be the obvious
solution. Yeah. It's one of

338
00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:25.010
the things that everything is
2020 in hindsight. And a

339
00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:29.030
lot of times we wonder
how can we get out

340
00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:31.580
there? How can we meet
people? And then somebody just

341
00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:35.570
says their Skype or their,
you know, go into IRC

342
00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:37.790
for it and ask one
of the people that you

343
00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:40.790
talk to, Hey, you want
to, you know, set up

344
00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:45.470
a remote pairing session. And
most devs will, are interested

345
00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:49.750
in coding with people. So
After you did this trip,

346
00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:52.390
then this thing called code
retreat starts up. Can you

347
00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:55.480
help me understand the relationship
between your, your pairing trip

348
00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:57.490
and what came out of
and what has become this

349
00:20:57.490 --> 00:21:02.310
thing called code retreats? Yeah.
So during the, during the,

350
00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:06.450
the year of 2009, several
guys in us, actually a

351
00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:11.100
code mash had thought of
the idea of what could

352
00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:15.480
we do to help people
practice software development, as opposed

353
00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:19.710
to the constant, like learn
new frameworks or things. And

354
00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:24.210
through the course of 2009,
we worked on establishing and

355
00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:28.200
sort of evolving this format
of a workshop that focused

356
00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:32.520
on the practicing the fundamentals,
rather than learning something new

357
00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:34.800
per se. Cause we spend
all of our time learning

358
00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:38.070
new things, but we forget
just the fundamentals of object

359
00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:42.000
oriented design, a test driven
development thing, these sorts of

360
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.380
things. And so code retreat
over the course of 2009

361
00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:51.180
and roughly 2010, we stabilized
onto a really good format

362
00:21:51.570 --> 00:21:55.440
that is reproducible. It works.
People have a great time

363
00:21:55.770 --> 00:22:00.450
and it's, we do 45
minute sessions through the course

364
00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:02.550
of the day we do
about five or six sessions.

365
00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:05.700
And we, at the end
of each 45 minute session,

366
00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:08.310
we delete all of the
code that we wrote. And

367
00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:11.520
we start again, we swap
pairs, start again. We work

368
00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:14.220
on Conway's game of life.
Cause it turns out it

369
00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:19.740
has an incredibly rich problem
domain and design characteristics that

370
00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:22.140
you can go in and
look at. And so the

371
00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:25.710
idea is that by deleting
the code, we're not left

372
00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:28.800
with the legacy decisions that
we had. So we can

373
00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:34.860
try new things. We can
practice really those core principles.

374
00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:38.190
I always introduce the four
rules of simple design and

375
00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:43.530
focus on naming and duplication.
And the facilitator then introduces

376
00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:48.900
different constraints and exercises each
session. And it's been going

377
00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:52.320
on for more than three
years now. We, they happen

378
00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:57.090
almost every weekend, somewhere in
the world. In December, we

379
00:22:57.090 --> 00:23:00.540
had global day of code
retreat where we had, we

380
00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:03.360
ended up with about 94
cities around the globe, all

381
00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:08.100
doing it on the same
day. And plans are roughly

382
00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:11.520
in place for doing the
second one this year as

383
00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:15.300
well. Wow. Now how does
is this, this is a

384
00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:18.150
nonprofit and this is something
I could put together in

385
00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:23.190
my town. Absolutely. It's specifically
designed so that you don't

386
00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:26.880
need one person. You don't
need me to be there.

387
00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:30.840
We have a, a situp
called code tree.org where you

388
00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:34.560
can find out information about
the format. And all it

389
00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:37.830
really takes is about, you
know, six to 10 people

390
00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:41.610
so that you can pair
and there's a set format.

391
00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:44.130
There's a recipe for it.
So even if you've never

392
00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:48.530
done it before, you can
follow this recipe, there are

393
00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:55.970
ideas for different session constraints.
There's a pretty active community.

394
00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:58.070
So if you ask questions,
a lot of people will

395
00:23:58.070 --> 00:24:03.500
answer. And yeah, we, when
we had the 94 cities,

396
00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:07.640
most everybody, it was their
first time facilitating a code

397
00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:11.180
retreat. And we, you know,
we told them everybody was

398
00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:14.990
a first time facilitator at
some point. And the, the

399
00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:18.800
format itself is designed to
be a really great day,

400
00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:23.390
even if you don't have
a very experienced facilitator. And

401
00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:25.700
that, that I think is
the key to having it

402
00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:28.280
expand as much as it
has over the last three

403
00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:35.330
years. And we, we just
started a nonprofit out of

404
00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:37.700
it that we're hoping to
be in a sort of

405
00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:43.130
an umbrella fundraising organization to
help fund kids programming events.

406
00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:47.120
And so the code retreats
I do, they're all free.

407
00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:51.140
Every one of the, one
of the core rules of

408
00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:53.480
a code retreat is that
it's free to the participants.

409
00:24:54.890 --> 00:25:00.410
And, but we oftentimes will
ask for a refundable deposit

410
00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:06.350
and I've started using them
as fundraising for this nonprofit

411
00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:10.940
to give kids, kids programming
events, stuff like we just

412
00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:16.040
funded the, or helped sponsor
the STEM video game challenge

413
00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:18.980
for black girls code, which
you had Kimberly on a

414
00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:22.870
couple of weeks ago. I
did. So the format you

415
00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:27.040
say that it's, it's, it's
fairly set it's set. Is

416
00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:28.900
it kind of like an
open space in the sense

417
00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:30.970
of like when you, when
you think about the idea

418
00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:32.350
of going to an open
space, you think, wow, this

419
00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:34.870
is going to be really,
really open and confusing and

420
00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:37.030
it's going to be like
really sloppy, but it's actually

421
00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:39.970
quite organized and there's definitely
a format and there's a

422
00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:42.610
big difference between a sloppy
open space. And one that

423
00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:46.540
is pretty well organized is
this, this is a coder

424
00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:48.760
heat is not just a
bunch of guys sitting in,

425
00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:51.040
you know, we can coding
that there is a, there

426
00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:53.090
is structure to it. And
even though like you said,

427
00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:56.200
anyone can, anyone can make
this happen. There are certain

428
00:25:56.200 --> 00:26:00.850
things that dictate success, right?
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's,

429
00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:04.450
it's 45 minutes. We work
on Conway's game of life

430
00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:07.120
at the end of the
45 minutes, you delete your

431
00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:12.820
code. And so it's, it's
very, it's a very structured

432
00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:18.070
day and it's, you know,
we, there's basically about 10

433
00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:22.300
or 15 minute break between
them and the facilitator generally

434
00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:25.990
talks and explained some constraints
for the next session. So

435
00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:29.860
like one, one session we
might do where there's methods

436
00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:32.980
have to be less than
three lines. No, if statements

437
00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:37.870
and no primitives passed over
method boundaries, and then it's

438
00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:43.260
like, okay, go. And one
session might be completely tell,

439
00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:49.410
don't ask. And it's really
this day of working in

440
00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:52.920
small 45 minute chunks on
a very set problem that,

441
00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:56.340
you know, over the past
three years, we, we experimented

442
00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:58.500
a little bit with different
problems, but found game of

443
00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:04.230
life to be just a
beautifully rich SIS or rich

444
00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:10.410
problem to experiment on different
topics in design. And Oh,

445
00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:14.220
another rule is there's no
pizza. There's no what pizza?

446
00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:18.080
So you get lunch and
it can't be pizza. I

447
00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:20.810
support that a hundred percent
pizza isn't as much as

448
00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:23.540
people think pizza is coding
fuel. I have found that

449
00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:30.530
it is in fact not.
Yeah. So you've got the

450
00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:32.870
speaking thing, you've got the
code retreat thing. You do

451
00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:37.160
consulting. This is all kind
of under the Corey kind

452
00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:39.560
of brand, but you're doing
so much of this for

453
00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:45.380
free. Yeah, I do. I
do in-company trainings as well

454
00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:49.700
for, to survive and to
get, make money. So I'll

455
00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:54.200
go into companies and do
I have an intermediate TDD

456
00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:56.510
workshop that I do. I
actually go in and do

457
00:27:56.510 --> 00:28:01.190
team based in house code
retreats for companies that are

458
00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:06.020
a little more focused towards
topics that the team needs

459
00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:09.470
to practice, as opposed to
the public ones are a

460
00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:14.270
little more free in the
topics. And I do in-company

461
00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:17.810
consulting like that as well
as my girlfriend and I

462
00:28:18.050 --> 00:28:22.940
work on are building some
products together. So we she's

463
00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:25.940
a developer as well. So
we do a development on

464
00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:29.690
side projects that so far
are not making a tremendous

465
00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:32.360
amount of money, but this
year we're, we've got a

466
00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:35.780
couple of things coming out
that we're hoping to build

467
00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:41.630
up. And the code retreat.org
website, you say that there's

468
00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:44.120
one going on. And they
said almost like almost every

469
00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:48.560
weekend. Yeah. And then there
are any specific rules about

470
00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:50.990
what you can't do. Like
could you make a code

471
00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:53.270
retreat and make it a
fundraiser for something at the

472
00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:57.350
same time? Yeah, you can
absolutely. It's. As long as

473
00:28:57.350 --> 00:29:02.480
it's free for the participants,
the rules, the surrounding rules

474
00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:05.180
of, you know, we're going
to raise money. One time

475
00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:08.000
I raised, I did a
code retreat in Bletchley park

476
00:29:08.570 --> 00:29:11.810
and we ended up raising
about, I think, $1,900 for

477
00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:17.390
Bletchley park. It's easy. Anything
you want to use, you

478
00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:21.140
know, use it for something
like that. I don't, I

479
00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:24.710
don't support the idea of
the community. Coder treats. I'm

480
00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:29.420
paying somebody like I've had
my travel expenses covered, but

481
00:29:30.050 --> 00:29:32.620
you know, bringing somebody in
and paying them, I, I

482
00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:35.450
don't support, but I, you
know, I don't, there are

483
00:29:35.450 --> 00:29:38.210
certain things that I'm very,
that I try to be

484
00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:42.880
strict about like the format
of it, but things around

485
00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:45.290
the edges of it. I'm
not, no, I'm not a

486
00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:48.670
dictator about it. And there's
a lot of people who

487
00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:51.430
are involved in more kind
of leadership roles in the

488
00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:57.160
community. And that's so it's,
it's very much a community

489
00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:00.550
oriented thing and code retreat.org.
You can find all of

490
00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:06.340
the events listed. There's a,
you know, usually like I

491
00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:08.890
think every weekend in March,
except st Patrick's day there's

492
00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:12.040
one going on, but I
wouldn't be surprised if somebody

493
00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:17.260
throws something together for that.
And there's also starting to

494
00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:22.060
expand out the family of
code retreat events, J B

495
00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:26.830
Ravensburger has put together a,
a format called Rifat or

496
00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:29.380
a legacy code or treat
where the format is still

497
00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:33.550
the same as a code
retreat. But the problem is

498
00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:39.100
really focused on working with
legacy code. And then Brian

499
00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:41.230
Merrick is just putting on,
we're going to run the

500
00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:45.700
first one on April 7th, a
refactoring code, or so he's

501
00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:51.940
put together some exercises around
practicing refactoring and the format

502
00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:55.420
will be the same, but
the problem and the focus

503
00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:58.870
will be a little bit
different. So we're slowly expanding

504
00:30:58.870 --> 00:31:02.890
out into a sort of
a family of code retreat

505
00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:06.510
style events. That's really clever.
I liked the idea of

506
00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:09.930
specialized ones. Let's just say
having one that is like,

507
00:31:10.550 --> 00:31:13.800
like a, like a kata
specific to something that is,

508
00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:18.660
that is not well understood.
Yeah. Yeah. And we, because

509
00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:22.140
of the fact that we're
very strict on the format

510
00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:24.630
of the standard code or
treat people ask, can we

511
00:31:24.630 --> 00:31:27.990
do a different problem? And
it's, and our general responses

512
00:31:28.290 --> 00:31:32.220
do game of life, because
until you've done it, you

513
00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:35.760
don't realize that you can
spend the whole day working

514
00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:40.800
on one problem. And the
guy Aviv in Israel just

515
00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:44.670
wrote a nice blog post
about attending his third code

516
00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:47.070
retreat. And they're still amazed
that there's so many different

517
00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:51.450
ways to approach the problem.
And because it has such

518
00:31:51.450 --> 00:31:55.740
a set format, it's him,
it's nice to see people

519
00:31:57.420 --> 00:32:00.660
sort of riffing on it,
but in a separate, in

520
00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:03.390
a different way and saying,
okay, well this is legacy

521
00:32:03.390 --> 00:32:06.450
code retreat. And that makes
us so that when people

522
00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:11.100
go to a code retreat,
they can know pretty clearly

523
00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:12.960
what their day is going
to look like. If they

524
00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:15.930
go out to hand, look
at the site and see

525
00:32:15.930 --> 00:32:19.620
what the, what the format
is going to be. Very

526
00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:24.090
cool. Very cool. So people
can learn about that@coderetreat.org, they

527
00:32:24.090 --> 00:32:27.390
can check out your blog.
You're easy to find on

528
00:32:27.390 --> 00:32:31.530
the web and on Twitter
as well. Yeah, pretty loud.

529
00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:35.610
And I'm luckily or happily.
If you go to Google

530
00:32:35.610 --> 00:32:37.770
and type a Haynes and
click, I feel really lucky

531
00:32:37.950 --> 00:32:41.150
if you get to my
blog for my website. Very,

532
00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:43.870
very cool. Thank you so
much for taking the time

533
00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:46.180
to chat with me today.
I really Oh, well, thanks

534
00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:47.980
a lot, Scott. It was
good talking to you. This

535
00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:50.470
has been another episode of
Hansel minutes and we'll see

536
00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:51.610
you again next week.
