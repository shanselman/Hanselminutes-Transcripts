From Hansel minutes.com it's Hansel
minutes or weekly discussion with

2
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.410
web developer and technologists. Scott
Hanselman hosted by Carl Franklin. This

3
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.640
is Lawrence Ryan announcing show number
one 35. Recorded live Wednesday,

4
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.820
October 8th, 2008. Support for Hanselman it's

com. In our last episode,
we kept the recorder rolling.

9
00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.480
After the show, as Scott
spoke candidly with the guys

10
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.440
from stack overflow, the result,
a podcast that's a little

11
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.200
less polished and a little
more irreverence. We hope you

12
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:14.480
enjoy it. This has been
another episode of Hansel minutes

13
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:20.180
and I'll see you again
next week. Cool, dude, that

14
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.640
was good. That's twice as
long as I like to

15
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:24.920
be, sorry, I didn't mean
to call you guys out

16
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:31.070
for, but you know, again,
it's so different. I mean,

17
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.210
I spent seven years making
sites like right, of course

18
00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.390
in flames today, but you
get the point, you know,

19
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.780
this, what you're doing is
not a best practice. It

20
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.730
can't be, you're going to
get, I'm worried. You're going

21
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.250
to get hacked. Right. Are
you worried you're going to

22
00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.540
get hacked? Well, I don't
think, no, not really. I

23
00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.050
mean, w w they would
have to like hack our

24
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.530
RDP passwords. Right? Well, now
that you throw it on

25
00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.080
the gauntlet, somebody's going to
try it. I didn't mean

26
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.450
it. We'll just go change
all our passwords to like

27
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.080
pass phrases. I mean, there's
something for that, but the

28
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.180
point is though, is that
people are going to hack

29
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.570
a port, not because now
with a password. I mean,

30
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.140
that's script kitty type stuff.
I'm talking about people hacking

31
00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.980
it, using known exploits in
the RDP protocol and overflowing

32
00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.870
a buffer and getting it
not because they're gonna figure

33
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.100
your password out, but that's,
that's Microsoft. I mean, that's

34
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.110
just a patch issue, right?
I mean, we do have,

35
00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.820
we do download lists, but
there's, there's certainly, there's zero

36
00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.490
day exploits in there. Certainly
most exploits are actually six

37
00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.190
week exploits where there's at
least a month to six

38
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.300
weeks of time where you,
the patches are being developed

39
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.180
and exploit and is known
by a few. But the

40
00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.000
point I'm making is that
there's there's, there are certain

41
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:55.910
agreed upon best practices for
security and some of, you

42
00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.060
know, layering, it is multilayered.
Right. And you're just, I

43
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.340
know if I, if I
were you and it was

44
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.070
my project, it was my
company. I would get a

45
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.980
security consultant to come in
and make recommendations and then

46
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.950
take him or leave him.
But I can think of

47
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.480
a dozen things that you
could do that would just

48
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.970
be involved, changing physical topology
and stuff that could, I

49
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.280
don't know. All I'm saying
is that when I was

50
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.050
working in banking, we, every
day we got to work

51
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.440
and it's like, is this
the day we're going to

52
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.600
be on ABC news? Or
is it going to be

53
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.640
tomorrow? Right. You know? Right.
Well, Jeff and I, well,

54
00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.620
we didn't get into background,
which is too bad, but

55
00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.660
it wasn't, it was a
long podcast. Jeff and I

56
00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.050
worked together on a company
that delivered nine one, one

57
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.460
system, like literally like, so
people would theoretically, theoretically someone

58
00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.710
called and our software didn't
work. Somebody could get killed,

59
00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.940
like, right. Like, Oh, my
child is my child can't

60
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.300
breathe. And then our software
crashes. Right. So we, we

61
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.020
know that feeling we found
was that the type of

62
00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.020
people developing the software, or
really no better than you.

63
00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.990
It's just weird. How, I
don't know, you just have

64
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:07.560
to make it work. It's
just special Value judgments. What

65
00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.200
I am saying is that
in my years of doing

66
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.970
that, it's got me paranoid
about security. And, and it

67
00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.460
sounds like you guys are
paranoid about security and reliability

68
00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:19.980
as well. I'm just surprised.
And we're getting, we're not

69
00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.990
recording anymore, but I'm just
surprised you played it so

70
00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:26.010
fast and loose with something
that is a huge target.

71
00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.550
You know what I mean?
It's a challenge who, who

72
00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.560
can bring down second or,
you know what I mean?

73
00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.120
Well, you've lived through several
of those already, so we're

74
00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.670
a little jaded, I guess.
Cause there's, it's a cipher

75
00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:41.790
programmers, dude. What do you
think they're doing? They're out

76
00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:43.560
there trying to do every
stupid thing you can think

77
00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.930
of. It's amazing. Jeff, have
you thought about doing any

78
00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.770
branded versions of your stuff?
Oh, it comes up like

79
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.580
every other day and I'm
totally for it, obviously, because

80
00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.040
I mean the whole reason
you create software, so lots

81
00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.900
of people can use it.
So sure. Why not? You

82
00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.360
want to spread your seed
far and wide, But wouldn't

83
00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.210
it split? Wouldn't it split
the knowledge though? Well, I

84
00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.760
think that the issue there
and Joel and I talked

85
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.160
a little bit about this
on our podcast was that

86
00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.890
it's really hard to develop
a product, right? Where you're

87
00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:14.160
shipping something to someone and
you know, it's like packaging,

88
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.830
an open source project. It's
like half or more of

89
00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.920
the work. Right. Building it.
That's that's, that's no thing.

90
00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:21.870
Right. You just built it.
Awesome. It works for you.

91
00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.630
It works on your, your
server and your context and

92
00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.850
it fits your mental model
of how the world works.

93
00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.730
Doris blog is a perfect
example for me because it's

94
00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:31.890
a great blog. It works
great for me, but we

95
00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:35.700
have no documentation. It's hard
to install cars. I don't

96
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.500
give it because it works
for me. That stuff is

97
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.890
a huge, huge amount of
work, right? Yeah. I think,

98
00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.920
Hey, we're not done. We're
still building very much actively

99
00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.560
building the site. Like there's
core pieces that are still

100
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.230
kind of missing. So it's
not ready. It's not fully

101
00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:51.990
baked anyway. But even if
it was fully banked, I

102
00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:55.350
would estimate at least two
to three months of just

103
00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:59.120
packaging the code, getting an
installer. But I was thinking

104
00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.480
more about that, about software
as a service style branding.

105
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:05.120
Well, even that, then we're
running like just brainstorming here.

106
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.460
But like if, if you
started, if you took like

107
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.100
a guy Kawasaki style doing,
you've seen his all top

108
00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:16.280
stuff, right? Yes. He's just
exploring of sub domains. Right?

109
00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.130
You've got these great tags.
Why don't you make tags

110
00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.710
sub so that I can
hit ASP, net dot stack

111
00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:24.050
overflow to comm and I
get a filtered view. I

112
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.440
can do it anonymously. I
don't need to have a

113
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.940
login. Right, Right. No, I
think the most obvious direction

114
00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.010
for this is we've said,
okay, this is a site

115
00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:35.140
for programmers. It's an explicit
goal, but there's a lot

116
00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:38.260
of people that are just
it guys that are kind

117
00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.330
of want to be programmers
a little bit. They know

118
00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.610
enough to be dangerous. I
know what you're going. Yeah.

119
00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:44.140
But be careful, you're gonna
get to the channel nine

120
00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:47.530
situation. Right. Because now they've
got channel eight, channel 12

121
00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:51.490
and 10 and 45, you
know? Right. But I think

122
00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:53.590
that's the most obvious direction
is to have a site

123
00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:57.340
for it. People. Yeah. That
comes up a lot. So,

124
00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:00.850
so, and it's not as
stack overflow, like DSOD yeah.

125
00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.240
Would you like some other
term, you know, SIS admins

126
00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.990
would know. Yeah. But yeah.
Our development process is pretty

127
00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:11.200
ghetto. I mean, there's no
doubt. I mean, honestly, I

128
00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.600
mean, we have just one
server and we do everything

129
00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.270
pretty much on one server
and I agree it's not

130
00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:18.610
ideal, but it's, it's sort
of like we're in startup

131
00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:20.590
mode. I'm just really trying
to keep our expenses. I

132
00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:23.320
would rather pay Jared than
buy another server when he

133
00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:28.300
puts you that way. Yeah.
Me too. Yeah, exactly. So,

134
00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:30.310
so that's the situation we
had and you know, we

135
00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:32.170
are starting to get some
ad revenue and we're starting

136
00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:33.760
to ramp up and there's
some other ways we're going

137
00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.340
to try to make money
on this thing. But until

138
00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:38.380
we need it, you know,
it's sort of an as

139
00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:41.110
you need it sort of
thing, and this is a

140
00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:44.290
credit to asp.net. If I
was doing PHP, we would

141
00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:46.960
be screwed. We wouldn't be,
God knows how many servers,

142
00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:51.460
right. It'd be Facebook. Yeah.
Have you thought about other

143
00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:53.140
things that are going to
spread out to like Facebook

144
00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:54.970
apps and stuff like that?
We are going to have

145
00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:58.420
a little badge. You can
put sort of a back

146
00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:00.010
link scheme where you can
say, okay, this is my

147
00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:02.770
stack overflow gamer card, right?
Like very much like the

148
00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.320
Xbox live gamer card because
the Xbox live stuff was

149
00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.330
the inspiration for a lot
of what we do in

150
00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:10.060
terms of badges and reputation
and things like that. And

151
00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:11.710
we want to have a
little badge that we're going

152
00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:13.780
to serve up, that you
can link to your blog

153
00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:15.550
or whatever. You should have
a whole host of them.

154
00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:17.470
I want to be able
to put my questions, my

155
00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:20.380
answers, my, my gamer card.
Yeah, exactly. It's like your

156
00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:22.450
game. One of the more
interesting game cards have like

157
00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:24.790
tabs. So like staying on
the gamer card, you can

158
00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:27.560
explore their profile. Yeah, Sure.
No, totally. I mean, that's,

159
00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:29.620
that's the direction we want
to go in because you

160
00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:31.900
know, people are proud of
the work they've done and

161
00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:34.060
this is more useful than
a gamer card. Cause this

162
00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:36.130
is about your professional life,
right? Yeah. I mean, if

163
00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:38.710
you're really good at CQL,
that's awesome. You can make

164
00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:40.990
money doing that. You can't
make money, killing people in

165
00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:43.780
halo for the most part.
Right. Interesting. If you put

166
00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:46.900
together an API, a rest
API, if people would build

167
00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:50.500
stack over 400 front ends
like Turrell, There's been some

168
00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:52.720
requests for full blown API.
As we've tried to shut

169
00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.460
a lot of it into
the RSS, we still have

170
00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:56.970
a lot more work do
around, you know, Adam feeds

171
00:08:56.970 --> 00:09:01.470
actually technically is what we're
using eventually an API for

172
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:04.590
now try to get as
much stuff behind, you know,

173
00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:10.820
Adam as Paul <inaudible> system,
not service model that's syndication

174
00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:18.230
stuff. Or are you using
organic? No, you're talking to

175
00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:23.300
us. Do you know who
you're talking to? Man, come

176
00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:25.280
on guys are killing me.
You're just like XML writer,

177
00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:27.050
but I don't know. Are
you like string builder? Come

178
00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:33.410
on The view. The view.
Okay. Well you guys should

179
00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:37.790
familiarize yourself with the results
stuff. Like, like rather than

180
00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:40.340
using a view for Jason,
you would use like Jason

181
00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:44.720
result. Right. You guys know
about that. Yeah. That's not

182
00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:47.180
an issue. Yeah. So you
get the idea though about

183
00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:50.560
action results as their own
kind of view. Yeah. Yeah,

184
00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:53.450
no, we got, you don't
need a view to do

185
00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:56.600
Adam. Right? You could just
say return Adam result, right?

186
00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.810
No, no, no. We do
know that, but actually this

187
00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:02.750
approach was kind of recommended.
So you're using views as

188
00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:05.600
templates. You have some template
that looks like a document

189
00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.370
you go for each and
you basically just have a

190
00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.640
view as a templater and
you spit out for each

191
00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:14.570
whatever and there's Adam that's
right. That's right. Yeah. Least

192
00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:21.230
resistance, I guess. Yeah. Amazing,
amazing stuff. And amazingly crappy.

193
00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:25.610
But Hey, I mean, again,
this, anytime you get like

194
00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:27.920
one of these, all button
that guys or me, or

195
00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:31.610
whoever bitching about purity, you
just say, Hey man, I

196
00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:35.560
did it. What are you
doing? Right. That's the Ninja,

197
00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:37.640
that's the comfort foods. You
just do the thing to

198
00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:41.360
take success. Do you know
how to make the possible

199
00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:44.300
out of the impossible? Well,
the dotnet ninjas at Telerik

200
00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:47.060
do they just released a
huge pack of web controls,

201
00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:50.090
all built on top of
ESPN at Ajax, that'll help

202
00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:53.210
you build impossibly fast and
interactive applications in no time

203
00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:57.200
at all. They've made the
impossible possible in desktop development.

204
00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:00.320
If you think you can't
have a carousel component and

205
00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:03.830
wind forms, well you can.
They're windows forms, suite features

206
00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:06.530
a super powerful grid view
control on 32 other crazy

207
00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:10.670
desktop components. That'll give you
a dazzling WPF like features,

208
00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:13.190
but in wind farms, they
do the same thing in

209
00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:15.800
reporting solutions with a new
design surface, like nothing else

210
00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:19.310
looks just like graph paper.
Cause you advanced page layout

211
00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:22.550
capabilities makes it feel more
like a graphic design software

212
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:26.090
than a reporting solution. Go
check them out@telerik.com and be

213
00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:30.200
a dotnet Ninja. And thanks
for listening. You really do.

214
00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.510
Have you got understand these
guys that we're talking to,

215
00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:34.970
these are, these are really
close friends of mine from

216
00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:37.850
previous jobs that were outstanding
programmers. So these are like

217
00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:40.820
my, it just happened that
the people that I would

218
00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:43.760
have handpicked to work with
on my previous job were

219
00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.070
available to work with me
on stack overflow. And they're

220
00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:50.420
working basically for slave wages,
right? So like we have

221
00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:52.670
to be very efficient in
how we work. We don't

222
00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:56.170
have weeks to set up
the ultimate set of unit

223
00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:58.870
tests, right. Where you can
just go and, you know,

224
00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:00.970
squirrel yourself away and just
do nothing but unit tests

225
00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:02.680
for a week. I mean,
we have to ship code

226
00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:07.000
to our users. Right. Right.
And we have to build

227
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.390
the features that actually drive
adoption of the application. And,

228
00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:13.300
and a lot of times
we can't be as pure

229
00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:15.760
as we would like to
be. But over time, we're

230
00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:18.010
going to go back and
start, you know, we believe

231
00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:20.680
in refactoring constantly. You know,
I I've, I've always said

232
00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:23.590
this, we're going to rebuild
stack overflow four times. Right.

233
00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:26.500
This is just the way
the software works. So I

234
00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:29.200
am totally open to coming
back and constantly improving things

235
00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:32.370
as well as there's time
to do. Yeah. Well good

236
00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:33.990
for you guys. I think
it's great. I wish, I

237
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:36.300
mean, I wish all the
success in the world. I

238
00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:40.680
think that envy is the
sincerest form of flattery. Yeah.

239
00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:42.900
Well, no, thanks. I mean,
it's a fun site. We

240
00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:44.730
just wanted to build something
that we liked. Right? Like

241
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.940
we, as programmers would want
to participate and I go

242
00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:51.180
in like, I'm on there
for hours every day. You

243
00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:53.010
guys are going to be
as successful as Digg or

244
00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:56.350
more so because you are
reinventing a genre. I think,

245
00:12:57.210 --> 00:12:59.010
I think it's great. I
think it's a big deal.

246
00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:03.240
And I think you're going
to make millions. That's tremendous.

247
00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:05.540
And thank you. But I
think that was the goal

248
00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:09.330
was like, Hey, let's build
something awesome for us. And

249
00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:11.280
when I say us, I
mean, programmers, this really is

250
00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.770
for us. Right. And I
think that's why Jeff and

251
00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:15.900
Jared have been doing such
a kick ass job for

252
00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:19.110
slave wages because they know
this is something they can

253
00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:21.930
point to wherever and say,
look, we helped build that

254
00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:24.120
over for me. You might
disagree with some of the

255
00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:28.290
architectural choices, but at its
core, any asp.net dev could

256
00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:29.940
come look at this and
they would get it. It's

257
00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:32.880
not like our code. Is
that crazy? Right? Yeah. I,

258
00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:35.770
I totally get your, I
don't know if you said,

259
00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:39.840
have you seen baby smash?
I have, I have, I

260
00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:43.320
have. I've seen screenshots of
it. Yeah. So you look

261
00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:44.880
back over for, it was
the way I wrote basically.

262
00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:46.830
Oh, that's right. Yeah. Hey
exactly. We're going to try

263
00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:48.420
it out with our kid.
We're just waiting for the

264
00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:50.190
kids To be boring. I
sat down and I was

265
00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:52.740
like, okay, I think I
should probably write some tests.

266
00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:55.710
And it was a calf
and it was done, you

267
00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:59.790
know? And it's horrible to
look at him. You had

268
00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:02.040
to learn WPF as well.
And WPF is kind of

269
00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:03.870
hard to learn, right? It's
like, it's a whole different

270
00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:06.090
world. It's a mess. And
I remember you blogging about

271
00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:08.640
that. And I worked with
WPF enough to see what

272
00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:10.200
you were talking about, where
you have to kind of,

273
00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:13.080
you have to make some
attempts that suck to learn

274
00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:14.820
it. Right. You have to
make mistake. So that's what

275
00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:16.680
I did with every smashed.
I made it suck on

276
00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:19.050
purpose. And then I'm trying
to dig myself out of

277
00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:20.910
the suck. I'll write it
four times before I'm done.

278
00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:24.510
Exactly. I'll write it four
times before I'm done. This

279
00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:26.220
is my philosophy with stack
overflow. We're just going to

280
00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:28.530
keep writing it until we
get it right. I mean,

281
00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:32.100
if people can make millions
of dollars writing crappy PHP,

282
00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:34.860
God knows what websites. Yeah,
we are certainly better than

283
00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:38.430
that. Yeah. The fact that
Facebook even exists is should,

284
00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:40.890
should be. That should make
you feel better about yourself.

285
00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:44.100
You just look at the
code of WordPress and you

286
00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:47.310
will disavow all code quality
for the rest of your

287
00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:49.680
life. Cause you'll realize it
totally doesn't matter. WordPress is

288
00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:52.610
a huge monster and it's
the worst code. It's horrible.

289
00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:54.460
I don't know really, but
due to my soul, I

290
00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:56.230
looked at, if I looked
at that code, that would

291
00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:58.350
probably, it would be a
dark line. It would just

292
00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:00.460
melt. It would just melt
your brain. And you realize

293
00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:02.920
that code quality is very
low on the list of

294
00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:05.290
things that matter. And that
said, I mean, we are

295
00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:11.770
Good. Yeah. We're not writing
crap. It's just, I think

296
00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:14.650
we're choosing some unorthodox methods
just to get things done.

297
00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:19.120
Yeah. That's the way I
would describe it. Cool. And

298
00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:20.920
then too, you know, I
use stack overflow to ask

299
00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:23.380
questions about stack overflow. I
mean the system can build

300
00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:25.960
itself. It's starting to get
embarrassed though. I'm starting to,

301
00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:28.360
I asked a question on
stack overflow, like my first

302
00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:34.360
question <inaudible> flow. I just
want to answer the damn

303
00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:37.120
question. I'm worried that people
are gonna think I'm a

304
00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:39.580
dork for asking some question.
That's a stupid question. You

305
00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:43.450
know, don't make a stupid
question. Batch, please. Did you

306
00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:48.010
see John, John SIG posted
some stuff? No way. I

307
00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:49.840
never realized like, Oh my
God, we're not worthy. We're

308
00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:51.610
not worthy. And the funny
thing is half the people

309
00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:53.620
probably didn't know who he
was. So because it was

310
00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:56.590
just some Joe Schmoe answering
their question, they didn't realize

311
00:15:56.650 --> 00:16:01.540
like he's a God, you
know? Yeah. It was on

312
00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:04.540
a jQuery itself. It was
great. And then it became

313
00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:07.630
the accepted answer. Like the
question asked her actually accepted.

314
00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:10.390
Okay, here you go. You
need a famous person stab.

315
00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:14.440
The one question I've asked
on stack overflow, I have

316
00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:17.620
not received a satisfactory answer.
I know I felt bad

317
00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:19.240
about that. I tried to,
I tried to bump your

318
00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:21.880
question. Did you see that?
Yeah. What is your question?

319
00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:23.650
It was a, it was
a question like how to

320
00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:27.790
do a request throttling. And
I know we were talking

321
00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:31.690
about on the podcast, we
were abusing the cash. Well,

322
00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:34.720
I'm abusing the crap out
of the cash by just

323
00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:38.080
putting in no simple records,
like a user's IP address

324
00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:40.870
and what we're trying to
throttle like as the key

325
00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:44.920
and yo just no value
and you know, it'll automatically

326
00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:48.160
expire. So when somebody posts
a question, if that records

327
00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.860
in the cash, you know,
we'll throttle them. If it's

328
00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:52.420
not in the cash, you
know, we'll put it in

329
00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:55.360
there and you know, do
the action that we're abusing

330
00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:57.010
the cash in that manner.
I couldn't think of a

331
00:16:57.010 --> 00:17:01.630
better way. Tell me a
week. And I'll, I'll ask

332
00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:05.860
some guys internally. Okay. Yeah,
that'd be great. Cool. Cool.

333
00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:08.500
Alright. You guys awesome. Thanks
so much. This will probably

334
00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:14.380
go up. Not this Friday,
but next Friday. Yeah. And

335
00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:16.480
also with regards to stack
overflow, I mean, if you

336
00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:18.970
have time, we could give
you access to the code.

337
00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:19.900
I mean, if you want
to come in and just,

338
00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:22.870
you know, critique it or
if there's some specific area

339
00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:25.300
you feel like we suck.
I don't know what value

340
00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:27.670
we provide at that point.
I mean, yeah. Well that's

341
00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:30.610
the thing. I mean, you
know, it's, it's completely voluntary

342
00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:32.380
and it's up to you.
Yeah. But what I'm saying

343
00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:33.790
is, I don't know, honestly,
if I would provide you

344
00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:36.820
value, I mean, if I
know what I care about

345
00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:40.510
and if you don't care
about those things, then that's

346
00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:44.740
cool, but me saying, it's
not going to change it.

347
00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:50.700
Right. I am fearful for
your security. That's the first

348
00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:51.840
thing you looking at. So
we'll just go in and

349
00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:54.830
change all our passwords. The
really long passphrase. Yeah. I

350
00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:57.560
thought about passwords and you
know, it, it's not about

351
00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:00.830
passwords. It's about physical security.
You're not going to get

352
00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:04.040
somebody at Microsoft to like
use the special Microsoft backdoor

353
00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:07.970
to it. No password is
bill G. No, we don't

354
00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:13.550
do that anymore. No. Seriously.
If you feel very strongly

355
00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:15.710
about something, I mean, okay,
so security, right? We'll take

356
00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:18.530
that under advisement. I mean,
we just need to remote

357
00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:20.710
desktop into the server. So
I mean, you're just saying

358
00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:23.150
the database server, we would
never be able to ruin.

359
00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:25.460
I mean, what are you
proposing? Exactly. Tell me what

360
00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:28.100
you were proposing. You would
have. I don't know what

361
00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:29.720
kind of firewalls and stuff
you have in the front,

362
00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:32.420
but you got here, your
main firewall, the front, it

363
00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:36.230
was just some physical piece
of hardware. And that probably

364
00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:38.180
would be a load balancer
for the future. When you

365
00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:43.670
have multiple web servers that
would have a white list

366
00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:47.690
of URL styles that we
would allow through. And of

367
00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:50.270
course, blacklists of bad IP
is and stuff like that.

368
00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:53.900
And you'd have your web
server, then you'd have another

369
00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:58.760
firewall that would let only
traffic from that Mac address.

370
00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:03.170
And that machine you'd have
IP sec talking from the

371
00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:07.250
web server to the SQL
server and do that. You

372
00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:09.770
know, you'd have impersonation at
that point. SQL server would

373
00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:12.350
be behind at that 0.2
firewalls and would have one,

374
00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:16.820
you know, one port open,
you'd have a separate network

375
00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:19.880
back plane for administration. That
is not part of the

376
00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:22.520
open internet. So your web
server and your SQL server

377
00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:25.700
are not on the same
network, meant that their management

378
00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:29.270
stuff is bound to a
different Nick to physical Nicks

379
00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:33.350
that are separate. And you
would be doing your RDP

380
00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:37.190
by RDP first into the
DMZ and then RDP from

381
00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:40.220
there into the boxes themselves.
Yeah. But how would you

382
00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:43.130
do this in the context
of like orcs, web, You

383
00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:45.650
talk to them and you
work it out. I have

384
00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:47.360
a physical box of Rockwell
to do whatever I ask

385
00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:52.350
them do. Okay. I'm just
saying, you were saying, at

386
00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:55.220
some point you'll be dig
sized and then you got

387
00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:57.740
to stop then, then you
know, and I'm just talking

388
00:19:57.740 --> 00:20:00.080
hyperbolically here, but you did
not manage your hours over.

389
00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:03.590
You think you have people
trying to hack you now.

390
00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:06.410
Right? Right. I have to
do that kind of setup

391
00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:09.980
for other e-commerce type stuff
that I'm running. I've never

392
00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:12.530
really taken a real strong
focus to this cause we

393
00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:17.000
really aren't start storing like
credit card information, even login

394
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.760
and usernames and passwords don't
end up in the database.

395
00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:23.630
So we don't know. So
as far as our surface

396
00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:25.400
plane, yes. Somebody can get
in there and do damage

397
00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:27.410
and destroy the database. So
what do we do? We

398
00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:30.140
restore from a backup. Okay.
Yeah. It's about reputation. It's

399
00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:32.450
about saying, when does the
blog post go up? That

400
00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:37.460
I hacked Joel on software.
I hacked, Right? Yeah. That

401
00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:41.660
reputation because your whole site's
on about reputation, right? It's

402
00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:44.090
a programming question site and
nothing would be more embarrassing

403
00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:46.310
in my perspective than to
blog than to destroy the

404
00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:49.510
website. If someone that's got
a sip, a website about

405
00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:52.890
answering questions, it's true. We've
had a few renegades where

406
00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:55.440
early on in our beta
that really loves to get

407
00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:57.300
in there and muck, The
only thing that could go

408
00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:01.740
be worse than that would
be extended downtime. But I'm

409
00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:03.870
also saying this, and this
is like 10% of what

410
00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:05.610
I'm talking about. 10%. What
I'm talking about is that

411
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.790
as an asp.net MVC site,
I would hate to get

412
00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:11.280
you that you'd be hacked.
And then someone playing NBC,

413
00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:16.260
right? You need to have,
you know, do these to

414
00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:23.790
have ice happy we right.
And URL scan installed. We,

415
00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:26.850
we have a rewrite installed.
I did not install Earl

416
00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:29.010
scan because I was afraid
it would break open ID.

417
00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:32.010
It does have a little
bit of an issue with

418
00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:33.480
open ID, but all you
have to do is make

419
00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:38.040
sure that that one end
point is cool. So on

420
00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:41.610
my side, I haven't reopened
ID problem because every single

421
00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:45.240
comment page is there's an
end point that someone could

422
00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:51.960
potentially log into, but you
don't have that problem. Right.

423
00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:54.960
So your asking scan would
be a great way to

424
00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:58.290
you up leave how much
you're getting hit. Probably with

425
00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:01.230
just random bullshit. Just to
see if someone's going hit

426
00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:04.260
you with more than, you
know, a certain amount of

427
00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:07.830
characters. I think I was
waiting. There's no really true.

428
00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:10.620
<inaudible> Earl scan yet. Is
there, we're still waiting on

429
00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:13.170
that Earl scan three or
leave is that I asked

430
00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:17.160
him in our old scam
it's in beta. Right? And

431
00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:20.580
then there's the new URL,
rewriting module. Yeah. Rewriting. We're

432
00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:22.440
doing, that's a core, in
fact, I just installed the

433
00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:25.290
go live the other day.
Okay. And then there's one

434
00:22:25.290 --> 00:22:26.490
other you might want to
look at, which is called

435
00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:30.290
a R R, which is
a forward proxy. It's like

436
00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:33.360
Apaches mod proxy. It lets
you do things like reverse

437
00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:36.120
proxies and stuff. So that
would be a way for

438
00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:38.910
you to do port forwarding
and were written in reverse

439
00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:41.640
proxy stuff. So you could
have, you could have your

440
00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:45.000
boxes farther behind the firewall
and rather than just doing

441
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.280
port forwarding from the inside,
you could do proxying from

442
00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:50.730
the outside. Right. Well, let
me play a little bit

443
00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:52.890
of devil's advocate here. Okay.
So if there were these,

444
00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:55.620
this is a pretty typical
config. In my opinion, we

445
00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:59.430
have windows firewall going. We're
only allowing like basically FTP

446
00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:02.340
web and remote desktop. Those
are the only things that

447
00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:05.880
are getting through the windows
server firewall. Right. And granted,

448
00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:07.590
you can always have more
security, but how is this

449
00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:10.770
any different than the average
Microsoft customer hooking up a

450
00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:13.200
server? That's supposed to be
secure out of the box.

451
00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:15.330
Right? For the most part,
I totally agree. And putting

452
00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:17.430
it on the public web.
I mean, if we have

453
00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:22.980
massive vulnerabilities based on, based
on, you know, right. I'm

454
00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:24.990
talking as a guy who
spent seven years in banking,

455
00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:27.690
that's all right. Once you've
done it, once you spent

456
00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:29.850
that much time doing this,
you can't think otherwise. Right.

457
00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:33.330
You know, I mean, dash
blog, Dutch blog is COVID

458
00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:36.570
base, but it's never going
to happen. I'm just saying

459
00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:39.120
that there has to be
some default level of security

460
00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:44.400
expectation around putting modern operating
system on the web, behind

461
00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:46.960
its normal firewall. You have
to have some reasons They

462
00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:50.260
never put RDP on a
public web server ever. And

463
00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:52.450
I would never put a
SQL server on a web

464
00:23:52.450 --> 00:23:57.280
server box ever. Right. That
was never opened 1433 or

465
00:23:57.280 --> 00:23:59.500
whatever that I, you know,
the address and I just

466
00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:04.210
wouldn't do it. I would
never have un-encrypted traffic moving

467
00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:07.690
between two boxes inside the
DMZ. Right. So I would

468
00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:10.690
encrypt the traffic between the
web server and SQL server.

469
00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:14.170
And that's just, that's just
me. I would say that

470
00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:17.710
it's probably like closing the
last one, half of 1%

471
00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:21.580
of problems. Like it could
potentially happen, but it makes

472
00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:23.110
me, it would make me
sleep better at night. I

473
00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:25.180
could not sleep knowing that
I had a parasite as

474
00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:28.210
popular as yours as wide
open as yours. That's fair.

475
00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:29.860
That's fair. I mean, this
is definitely the kind of

476
00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:31.720
feedback I'm looking at here.
No, but some people just,

477
00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:33.370
they don't, they don't lock
their car and they're like,

478
00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:36.190
yeah, I live in a
nice neighborhood. Right. And that's

479
00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:38.440
totally fine. Except for the
one time when your car

480
00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:40.780
has gone, but you never
know when that's going to

481
00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:43.240
happen. You could live your
entire life. My grandmother's 95,

482
00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:45.400
never been in an accident.
Never had her car stolen.

483
00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:47.890
Never locked your doors. Or
if you live down here

484
00:24:47.890 --> 00:24:49.840
in Corvallis, you know, you
know everybody, you could see

485
00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:53.110
your car driving down the
street and go, I do.

486
00:24:56.110 --> 00:25:00.430
Ah, cool. And we're just
neighbors sorta. Yeah. We both

487
00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:04.420
live in little towns in
Oregon. How far far is

488
00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:08.920
that? He's about 45 minutes
away. Yeah. Oh, well the

489
00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:10.510
next Scott, the next time
you do like a geek

490
00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:13.660
lunch or something, you should
make sure. Yeah. Jeff, you

491
00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:15.130
should go. I mean, do
you, Scott, do you ever

492
00:25:15.130 --> 00:25:17.170
do anything locally? Actually, I
was down at Corvette. I

493
00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:19.760
was at an Oregon state
giving this presentation recently, so

494
00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:22.930
yeah, I should Good. Next
time. You're doing some locally

495
00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:25.870
ping me or Jeff and
we'll make sure Jeff is

496
00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:30.520
there. Cool. Well dude, thanks
for doing the podcast with

497
00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:33.970
us. And as always, I
mean, we definitely every, all

498
00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:36.910
this input, particularly from leaders
like yourself, we look at

499
00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:39.310
it and take very seriously.
So obviously we're going to

500
00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:40.510
look at the RDP thing
and see what we can

501
00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:44.380
do about that. Cool. You
know, ask, ask around. I've

502
00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:47.020
got a buddy of mine
who is a chief security

503
00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:51.130
officer at, at Kirlian. He's,
he's hanging out now. He

504
00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:53.860
cashed in his stock options.
If you're interested in talking

505
00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:56.650
to anybody about security, you
know, he, this guy, this

506
00:25:56.650 --> 00:26:01.210
is Greg Hughes, right as
radio. All right. You're listening

507
00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:03.940
to run as radio tonight.
T podcasts on Carl Franklin's

508
00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:06.250
network. I haven't listened to
it, but I do know

509
00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:09.910
the name. Yeah. Anyway, Greg
hughes.net. He's a security expert,

510
00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:12.070
but you know, any of
those guys just talk to

511
00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:14.230
Carl or two, I'm actually
the best guy to talk

512
00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:17.560
to about security and network
stuff would be, would be

513
00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:22.210
fricking Richard Campbell. I'll do what
you're gonna do. You could,

514
00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:24.580
you should do this. You
should talk to Richard. Campbell

515
00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:29.290
is he is an owner
of strange loop networks. Strange

516
00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:33.370
loop networks is currently working
on an appliance that sits

517
00:26:33.370 --> 00:26:36.310
like in your fi after
your firewall. That is a,

518
00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:40.090
an out of band caching
thing like velocity. And they're

519
00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:43.440
looking at ways to accelerate
NBC right now you just

520
00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:45.330
plug the appliances and you
push a button and then

521
00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:47.880
new offload stuff, like, you
know, all your cash issues

522
00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:51.680
moving off of a hardware
appliance, Right? Yeah, no, that's

523
00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:54.920
cool. I remember his trains
loop stuff. I had seen

524
00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:57.450
some stuff about it. So
That'd be cool if you

525
00:26:57.450 --> 00:27:00.140
guys play with philosophy yet,
We haven't looked at it

526
00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:02.150
yet. I mean, eventually you're
right. Eventually we get to

527
00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:05.180
a certain scale. You should
look at the city because

528
00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:07.220
even if you didn't, even
if you kept your stuff

529
00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:09.650
the way it is, like
which one, one box you

530
00:27:09.650 --> 00:27:12.470
could have another whole box
dedicated to just caching, right.

531
00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:16.430
And velocity supports in Prague,
out of proc cluster, whatever.

532
00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:21.590
Right. Right. Adding more boxes
is in the, in the

533
00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:24.380
cards. I mean, for sure
at the very least we're

534
00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:26.990
going to have a separate
database server. Just, it's just

535
00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:30.140
a question of when. Right.
And also we want to

536
00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:32.240
move to SQL 2008. Do
you think we'll get a

537
00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:33.950
big, do you think we'll
get any kind of performance

538
00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:37.160
boost from going from 2005
to 2008 On the SQL

539
00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:40.160
side? Maybe 20%. Yeah. Not
too much. Not as much

540
00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:42.020
as you got from going
from iOS six to iOS

541
00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:45.530
seven, 20% is a ton.
And that would be pretty

542
00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:48.170
dramatic. It's just, there's a
lot more, apparently the query

543
00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:51.260
analyzer speak to the, the
query plan is a lot

544
00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:53.150
smarter. Now. I think we
are going to kind of

545
00:27:53.150 --> 00:27:55.670
wait until service pack one,
just to be sure. Everything's

546
00:27:55.730 --> 00:28:00.020
nailed down. It's really good.
On 64 bit machines with

547
00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:02.240
eight gigs around that's where
the, where the sweet spot

548
00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:04.820
is, You know, what sucks
about upgrading our server? So

549
00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:07.280
our server is four gig
to upgrade to eight gig

550
00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:10.070
would cost us as much
per month as getting another

551
00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:14.240
server. Ridiculous. Cool. All right.
Well, I do have to

552
00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:16.250
run, but I'll email you
in this podcast and I'll

553
00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:17.300
catch you guys later. Thanks
again.
