Hi, this is Scott Hanselman.

8
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.900
This is another episode of
Hansel minutes today. I'm talking

9
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.200
with George <inaudible>. He's the
co founder of a startup

10
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.430
in Kenya called moot. How
are you? I'm good, Scott,

11
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.000
how are you? Yeah. Good
to see you again. We

12
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.580
were hanging out a couple
of weeks ago and now

13
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.680
I'm back. I'm back here
and I'm jet lagged and

14
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.060
I hope you are Enjoying
the sun. You had a

15
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.980
long trip ahead of you,
so I'm glad to hear

16
00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.990
you made it safe. We're
waiting for you to come

17
00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.570
back already. We're planning your
visa and a little trip

18
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.350
out to see some animals.
We've got you covered. I

19
00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.320
appreciate that. I appreciate that.
Of course, when we talked,

20
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.170
I told you I'm actually
more interested in the people,

21
00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.470
the animals we'll do the
people there who was interesting.

22
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.230
And when I met you,
we were at kind of

23
00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:35.000
a startup showcase because there's
a lot of really cool

24
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.060
startups that are going on
in, in Kenya, in Nairobi

25
00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.650
specifically <inaudible> M O O
K H. I had my

26
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.130
move.com is a, is one
of them. So what's, what's

27
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.900
the pitch of what Mooka
is? Well, Well, we're in

28
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.650
an environment where it's it's.
I mean, for a long

29
00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.650
time, people have referred to
Africa as, as the developing

30
00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.820
world. And so we're at
a point now where there's

31
00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.660
so much that is being
developed in this developing world

32
00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.830
that is innovative, that is
different, and that is made

33
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.100
to accelerate the kind of
growth that we have to

34
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.820
what we see. So we,
with the incoming of the

35
00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.550
internet and all that, we
have been able to see

36
00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.130
so much more. And so
even as we build and

37
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.060
as we grow, our eye
is on that. So moon

38
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.950
MOCA is a, is a
payment processing platform. And we

39
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.090
focus on online payments. And
our key customer is small

40
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.830
to medium enterprises who are
looking to start their online

41
00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.990
trade. So not a lot
of the enterprises that are

42
00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.560
already making big bucks online,
who are all the new,

43
00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.560
small scale businesses that are
starting up that need to

44
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.210
get online and need to
start commercializing their businesses. Now,

45
00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.120
in the States, when I
want to buy something, I

46
00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.380
go online. I take out
either my debit card, which

47
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.250
comes from my checking account
of real money, or I

48
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.400
have my credit card, which
is borrowed money that I

49
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.990
borrow a little bit of
a month and I pay

50
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.080
back every month. Yes. Why,
why can't I just do

51
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.540
that? Because you need to
realize that we come from

52
00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.830
an environment where until I'll
say maybe 10 years almost,

53
00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.540
if I was to give
it a lot 15 years,

54
00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.970
a large percentage of the
population was completely unbanked. These

55
00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.780
are people who operated and
until today, some still operate

56
00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.620
no bank account at all,
which means that obviously they

57
00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.640
have no cards to associate.
And which means that even

58
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.230
how they interact is either
within the reach of somebody

59
00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.910
I can get to and
pay cash or, or nothing.

60
00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.510
And so we, we, we
are working in an environment

61
00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.320
where, when you talk about
online payments, that you're starting

62
00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.570
from the point where the
customer or the end user

63
00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.330
is not holding onto a
card. And so it's, how

64
00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.470
do they get their physical
cash into your online platform?

65
00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:11.610
So the physical cash of
course is not possible. And

66
00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.450
you're running around with difference
with this currency. They can't

67
00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.700
do anything with you. Don't
have a card or a

68
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.160
bank, where do you keep
your money? You keep it

69
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.720
in a, like, my dad
would keep it in a

70
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:27.060
jar. That's not scalable. You
can't have my small business

71
00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.510
keeping my money in a
pile somewhere. So where does

72
00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.170
the money live? Believe it
or not. Until until the

73
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.510
15 years ago, there was
a lot of people keeping

74
00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.090
that money in the jar
or under their mattresses or

75
00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.920
somewhere. And then as mobile
phones came in and as

76
00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.860
technology started to come in,
one of the craziest we'll

77
00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.170
call it crazy. One of
the craziest things that happened

78
00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.520
on this side, especially here
in Kenya, was the mobile

79
00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.120
networks were bent on making
sure every single person in

80
00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.910
the country. We have a
population of about 40 million people.

81
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.150
They were bent and making
sure every single person has

82
00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.460
a mobile phone. And as
they were doing that, the

83
00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.620
subsequent questions that came about
is what else can we

84
00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.830
give this people that they
haven't had before by giving

85
00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.010
them a mobile phone? And
one of those solutions was

86
00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.370
this thing called M Pesa.
Pesa is money in Kiswahili.

87
00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:25.050
So M is mobile, mobile
Pesa. And they put a

88
00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.080
mobile wallet, which is what
you would be used to,

89
00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.420
if you, if your bank
offered a wallet or something

90
00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:33.360
like that, they put this
wallet into the SIM card,

91
00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.270
which meant that every single
phone, whether it was a

92
00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.480
feature phone or a smartphone
that got to all this

93
00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.110
40 million people came with a
wallet in it. And what

94
00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.200
that meant for trade is
that now you have a

95
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.750
way that once this wallet
is adopted, how do we

96
00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.120
make sure that they can
use this wallet across the

97
00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.190
board on, on online and
offline as well to, to

98
00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.830
trade and make it a
trusted? Ah, okay. So the

99
00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:02.080
couple of things I'm hearing
there that are significant is

100
00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.410
that the phone came that
way. It's not like in

101
00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:07.990
the States where if I
launch a startup, I have

102
00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:10.270
to go and download an
app. It came on the

103
00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:13.600
SIM, they went straight to
the, they went straight to

104
00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.820
the vote of the Vodafone,
the Safari comm the voter.

105
00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:19.960
Yes. And so, and so
you, your same came already

106
00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.910
with a menu in it
that went to the same

107
00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:26.290
and note that when we
got mobile phones, by the

108
00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:29.020
time we're getting mobile phones,
the internet was already advanced.

109
00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.450
By the time mobile phones
were becoming big. On this

110
00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:35.740
side, the internet had, had
gone past what the, what

111
00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.590
we'd call the baby stage
or the entry stage that

112
00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:40.690
you went through in the
States where we started with

113
00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:43.840
an email or a dial
up connection, or that now

114
00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:47.260
we started with the mobile
phone as the primary channel

115
00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.260
for me to connect to
everything. So on top of

116
00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.890
learning mobile and mobile payments,
this is also when we

117
00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:57.100
learned social media. So at
the same time, for example,

118
00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:00.130
the Facebooks and those things
are starting is the same

119
00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:02.980
time that we're plugging into
mobile. So the kind of

120
00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:05.440
apps we're getting into and
the kind of interaction we

121
00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:09.250
have on the internet was,
was not traditional in any

122
00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:12.970
way. We started with certain
features that we considered basic.

123
00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:16.210
So that ordinary Kenyan considers
the wallet in their phone

124
00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:22.050
as a standard basic feature.
That's interesting. And the, the

125
00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:26.080
amount of signup is so
minimal. Like I, I'm still

126
00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.930
trying to get family members
to use Apple pay right.

127
00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:32.830
Or contactless payments, but it's
because it requires what we

128
00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:36.310
call in the UX world
ceremony. Right? I have to

129
00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:38.110
go through the ceremony. I
have to tell it about

130
00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:41.200
my, at my, my credit
card. I have to install

131
00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:42.760
my credit card. And then
I have to do an

132
00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:46.060
authorization back and forth. Now,
what if I lose my

133
00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:49.900
SIM or I, I, I
get a new SIM, can

134
00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:54.250
I move money between Sims?
So once you, because this

135
00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:59.080
is a SIM built application,
it means that it's already

136
00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.210
attached to your phone. If
your SIM is off of

137
00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:02.740
your phone is off and
you lose it and you

138
00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:06.070
replace your same. It comes
back with the exact same

139
00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:09.580
state. It was before the
same contacts, same amount of

140
00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:13.540
money. And the most interesting
thing to note about this

141
00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:16.360
and Pesa is that there's
all this agents and there's

142
00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:19.510
all this virtual modes to
put in and take out

143
00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:24.340
the money. But what people
actually trade is is it's,

144
00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:27.040
it's the next level of
virtual money, because all I

145
00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.500
get is a text message
on my phone that says

146
00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:34.330
Scott has sent me 2000
Kenya shillings. And for me,

147
00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:37.720
it's, it's the complete trust.
And the fact that from

148
00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:40.510
this text message, if I
went somewhere and went into

149
00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:44.050
my same application and went
for example, to an ATM

150
00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:47.320
machine, because then these things
are plugged into several lawyers.

151
00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.810
I went online and I
needed to do a transaction.

152
00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:53.800
If I hit send out
of my text message, I,

153
00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:58.560
it will guarantee a and
that trust is what it

154
00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.980
has taken several years to
build. But then that becomes

155
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:05.730
the transformative part of business,
because then people trust doing

156
00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:09.240
business on a text message.
They trust that if I'm

157
00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:12.240
buying a product and I
send you this, and I

158
00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:15.060
get the text message confirmation,
then it's as good as

159
00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:17.930
a done deal. So let
me ask a couple of

160
00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:20.540
ignorant questions. And actually in
this case, most of my

161
00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:23.300
questions come from a place
of my own ignorance. What

162
00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:25.520
if I just copy paste
the text message? Of course,

163
00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:28.670
people can tell it didn't
come from an Pesa central.

164
00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:31.220
It came from, I just
clearly this person copy pasted

165
00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:33.170
to trying to cheat me.
I go into the SIM

166
00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:36.290
application. I confirm the money
was not sent, correct? Correct.

167
00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:40.430
Okay. So you always can
go back into the SIM

168
00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:44.090
and double check. You always
have access to the SIM

169
00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:46.460
and the SIM is able
to give you balances. It's

170
00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:48.530
able to give you so
the same way you'd operate

171
00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:53.390
a bank and a mobile
banking system. All those features

172
00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:57.290
that are available in this
little SIM application. If, if

173
00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:59.270
you let's say you and
I are having lunch, you

174
00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:01.400
go to the restroom, you
leave your phone. I pop

175
00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:04.220
your SIM out. I run
away. Have I stolen your

176
00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:07.910
money? No, you've taken a
SIM, but because it still

177
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:11.270
requires a pin, just like
a car transaction. By the

178
00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:13.400
time you're about to finish
the transaction. You'll need to

179
00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:17.240
put a unique pin. And
so if, if I have

180
00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:19.100
your phone, but I don't
know the pin, I have

181
00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:21.950
no access to that wallet.
And then you fit, you

182
00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:25.760
can recover this money somehow.
Exactly. This has been really

183
00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:29.270
interesting because the, as an
iPhone user, I've had an

184
00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:32.690
iPhone for many years. I
always thought if you asked

185
00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:36.020
me that I knew where
everything was like, there's no

186
00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:40.310
corner of my iPhone that
I don't know. Yes. When

187
00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:43.850
I was talking with you,
you went to settings, then

188
00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:46.490
you clicked on phone and
you had a menu that

189
00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:50.960
said, SIM applications in my
brain exploded. I told my

190
00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:54.800
boss about this. And he
immediately went running to settings

191
00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.980
and phone and he doesn't
have that option. But when

192
00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:00.050
you click on it, these
are apps that I assume

193
00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:04.310
run anywhere. They're little who
knows Java something. You know,

194
00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:05.630
you can take that SIM
and put it in an

195
00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:08.840
Android phone and you'll have
the same app. Exactly. And

196
00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.660
the benefit of it is,
is that if I left

197
00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:15.650
Nairobi today and I was
roaming to South Africa, or I

198
00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:18.680
came out to the States
tomorrow and I have my

199
00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:22.070
same card on roaming, I
have the exact same access

200
00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:23.900
to the wallet as I
do. If I was at

201
00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:27.650
home. That's yeah, that's powerful.
And this, this is where

202
00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:30.860
I think things get interesting
from a social change perspective.

203
00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:33.860
Is this an augmentation of
banking or is this a

204
00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:36.710
reinvention of banking? Like you're
telling me that a business

205
00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:39.140
could even not have a
bank account if they chose

206
00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:43.730
to. So for example, when,
when we started conceptualizing MOOCs

207
00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:46.760
and this was, let's say
five years ago, what we

208
00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:50.300
were trying to crack is
how does the match and

209
00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:53.470
who sent them? Because if
you're selling an item, that's

210
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:58.300
five, $10, okay. Especially out
in this market, a small

211
00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:02.440
denomination amount, this people, the
consumer here is keeping up

212
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:06.790
to 50, to a hundred
dollars easily on their mobile

213
00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:09.310
wallet. The mobile wallet will
let you keep up to

214
00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:15.280
$700 in the wallet. Okay?
So any small transactions that

215
00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:17.050
happen if I need to
buy air time, if I

216
00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:19.960
need to buy a little
thing, I'd rather use this

217
00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:22.690
mobile wallet and pull out
a card that attracts that

218
00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:26.400
in charges. That will be
X percent. So all of

219
00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:29.440
those, because the transaction fees
on the mobile on this

220
00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:32.950
mobile wallet is at call.
It minimal. It's less than

221
00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:39.310
1% per transaction. Okay. So
a lot of micro fees.

222
00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:42.340
So a lot of the
consumers would rather use this

223
00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:44.380
to pay than anything else.
And so when we were

224
00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:48.280
going online, we could have
plugged into a visa, for

225
00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:51.430
example, as our entry point
for, for mobile payments and

226
00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:56.650
just kept going, or we
could have plugged into a

227
00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:59.230
Stripe for example, or something
like that. So there are

228
00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:02.920
solutions out there that rely
on the banking system. But

229
00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:07.690
when we looked at our
consumer here, at least 50%

230
00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:09.460
of them are cut out
by the fact that they

231
00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:11.950
do not have this cards,
or they're not in the

232
00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:15.520
formal banking sector, but they
do have this emphasis and

233
00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:18.070
they do have the spending
capacity. So for us, it

234
00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:22.360
was, this was an equal,
if not more important channel

235
00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:28.030
than plugging into the traditional
bank. And even today, if

236
00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:32.650
you look at our transaction
volumes, at least 85% of

237
00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:37.680
that is coming from mobile
versus traditional banking. Nope. It's

238
00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:42.690
so interesting that while over
here on this hemisphere in

239
00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:46.440
Europe, you hear all this
talk of Bitcoin, but from

240
00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:51.720
a user experience perspective, it's
not user friendly. It's like

241
00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:53.970
I joke a little bit.
It's like the Linux desktop,

242
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.680
everyone keeps saying that this
is the year that the

243
00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:58.260
Linux desktop is going to
happen. Right? They've been telling

244
00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.380
me that for 20 years,
Bitcoin is never going to

245
00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:07.020
be successful for the average,
you know, Joe and Jane

246
00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:12.090
Kamau, if it still involves
giant, globally unique identifiers and

247
00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:15.750
two gigabyte wallets and Pesa
is it works because it's

248
00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:19.350
user experience is so simple
and so clean. I don't

249
00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:22.110
see how Bitcoin, I mean,
maybe it gets all of

250
00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:27.600
the, the news articles, but
it seems like mobile wallets

251
00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:29.460
could be the future of
banking and the future of

252
00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:33.030
money. And the thing is,
we are now operating in

253
00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:35.220
a place where, because of
how close we've become to

254
00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:37.200
our mobile phone, you know,
when you think about a

255
00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:41.580
Bitcoin, you think of something
new, something different. When we're

256
00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:44.580
now our users think about
their mobile wallets because of

257
00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:47.040
how they have their mobile
phone in their hand, every

258
00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:50.700
single minute of the day,
almost it doesn't feel like

259
00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:54.440
you're something new to them.
It feels like this wallet

260
00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:56.570
is already a part of
me. It's on my phone.

261
00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:59.750
And so you're not telling
them about a new way

262
00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:02.330
to do business. You're telling
them the thing that you

263
00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:07.640
already have is your guaranteed
payment system. And that's trust

264
00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:10.310
has taken such a long
time to build that. Now

265
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:12.950
you'll find people who would
rather use that mobile payment

266
00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:15.620
system than use cash. And
when you think about the

267
00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:19.520
business of online, where, especially
in Africa, a lot of

268
00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:23.630
the online transaction, so you
lied on cash on delivery,

269
00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:28.310
which has its own drawbacks
for people to now trust

270
00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:31.490
another payment model more than
they trust cash means that

271
00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:34.490
they're more willing to send
you this mobile payment, even

272
00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:37.460
before they get the item,
because they have a reference

273
00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:41.090
of it. If you do
a wrong transaction, or if

274
00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:43.640
you send money to the
wrong person, there's a way

275
00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:45.890
to report it and have
it reversed. So there's a

276
00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:50.510
system which the consumer has
grown with, and this has

277
00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:54.260
completely changed the landscape of
how they use the service,

278
00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:58.570
Right? So the model, the
user experience model is cash.

279
00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:00.250
Like if we have a
question about how this should

280
00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:03.910
work, how would cash do
it? Let's do that. Exactly.

281
00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:09.250
There's a great article in
business, insider.com that talks about

282
00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:11.890
forget banks. If Bitcoin is
going to change the world,

283
00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:13.810
and this is the real
competition, and it talks about

284
00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:17.920
in Pasa. And one of
the charts says, the regions

285
00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:20.470
in the world that are
in, that are least in

286
00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:24.730
need of Bitcoin, have the
largest share of Bitcoin accepting

287
00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:28.630
businesses. It's, it's, it's flipped
on its head, Europe and

288
00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:32.830
North America don't need Bitcoin,
South Asia, South America, India,

289
00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:36.670
Africa need a new kind
of currency. So rather than

290
00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:40.030
letting the, the Western world
come up with this, they

291
00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:42.040
did it themselves. You did
it, you did it yourself.

292
00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:44.800
Yeah. And, and the, and
the good thing is to

293
00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:46.960
see. And I mean, it's
a good thing. And it's

294
00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:49.480
also the current challenge. And
it's the thing to crack

295
00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:54.880
now, it's that within that
African landscape, unlike in the

296
00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:59.860
States where between one state
and the next state, the

297
00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:02.590
mechanics would be the same.
The banking system is the

298
00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:05.620
same that Karen sees the
same and all this other

299
00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:08.560
factors. When you look at
Africa, you have all these

300
00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:12.400
countries where between me and
Uganda, which is just a

301
00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:16.210
couple of kilometers across, it's
a different currency, it's a

302
00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:20.920
different mobile network. It's a
different system of banking. And

303
00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:24.580
so what you're seeing now
is in, in all the

304
00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:28.570
big African countries, you're having
little M as kind of

305
00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:32.470
mash rooming and becoming the
mode of payment. So you're

306
00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:35.650
finding other countries starting to
accept this mobile way of

307
00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:39.670
payment or this mobile way
of moving money. And now

308
00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:42.160
the thing is becoming, how
do we start to unify?

309
00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.890
Because if you look at
the numbers of our combined

310
00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:49.740
African market, as opposed to
the individual little markets, if

311
00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:54.360
we're able to get one
mobile wallet across that everybody

312
00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:57.930
uses the same way that
everybody uses visa or MasterCard,

313
00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:01.770
or one of these other
cards. Then you have almost

314
00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:05.820
a billion people who will
be transacting at less than

315
00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:10.440
1% on a currency that
is completely virtual and that

316
00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:14.700
lives on their phones and
that they trust because it

317
00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:17.550
understands where they've come from.
When, when you compare to

318
00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:22.550
the banking system, Then putting
my brain in the, in

319
00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:24.770
the brain of the audience
who may be listening, or

320
00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:26.780
maybe a fan of Bitcoin,
and they might be yelling

321
00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:29.450
at their, at their radios
and their podcast apps right

322
00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:31.670
now, they may say, well,
wait a second, the real

323
00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:33.950
problem. Then the one thing
that's going to hold and

324
00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:36.200
piss it back is that
it's not open, it's owned

325
00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:41.420
by Vodafone, Correct. And Been
a problem as a user

326
00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:43.430
of this. I mean, building
your platform on something that's

327
00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:46.460
owned by a company and
not by the people. Here's

328
00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:51.740
the thing about it, Vodacom
on, on the biggest version

329
00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:56.150
of it, right? They own
the M Pesa itself. But

330
00:18:56.180 --> 00:19:01.820
the, the, the way in
which that system works is

331
00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:05.540
what other networks have also
replicated and built. And when

332
00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:07.670
you think about it, what
they built as a wallet,

333
00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:09.950
if you, if you look
at what the core functionality

334
00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:14.060
of MSA is, the amount
of things that have stemmed

335
00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:15.830
out of it. So for
example, to be able to

336
00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:21.170
trade online, we use a
short code, kind of M-Pesa

337
00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:25.970
as opposed to a mobile
phone number and the operation

338
00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:28.820
that has developed the little
short codes. And that manages

339
00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:32.870
the transactions online, away from
the mobile SIM card is

340
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:36.980
something that has been developed
and innovated by another set

341
00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:41.150
of developers outside of Vodacom.
So as much as the,

342
00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:45.110
the application lives on the
same card, there is the

343
00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:49.430
opportunity for developers to take
this concept and start to

344
00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:52.400
adapt it into something that
works in different ways. So

345
00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:55.250
like, what is being used
online? What is being used

346
00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:59.660
at businesses as a tale,
for example, is all spinoffs

347
00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:04.070
of M-Pesa. That just rely
on the end user already

348
00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:06.350
having this money on their
phone and needing to be

349
00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:09.320
able to pay. So what
we're doing is innovating around

350
00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:13.970
this big idea. Imagine if
you could innovate around the

351
00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:17.870
Bitcoin and create your own
online version for the Bitcoin

352
00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:20.360
to be used in your
system is the kind of

353
00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:24.260
environment we're playing in at
the moment. So you're not

354
00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:27.650
finding that it being controlled
by Safari comm or Vodafone,

355
00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:30.170
Neupro Vodacom being an issue.
You're still able to call

356
00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:31.880
the API as you need
to call, move the money

357
00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:36.170
around. And it's, it's, it's
working out. Okay. Exactly. And

358
00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:38.780
if anything, they're looking to
us to be able to

359
00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:43.430
see what else can this
little payment monster that we've

360
00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:47.620
built be able to do
in other environments. So, yes,

361
00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:51.850
we've gotten 40 million SIM cards
already where this wallet, how

362
00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:54.010
can we make sure that
they are transacting more? How

363
00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:56.110
can we make sure that
as they grow, as they

364
00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:59.710
become more tech savvy, as
they start to shop in

365
00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:02.410
different markets, how can we
make sure that this platform

366
00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:05.350
can adapt? And so, even
as the owners of the

367
00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:08.230
platform, they are looking to
the developers, and this is

368
00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:11.680
the benefit of a space
with a big development community,

369
00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:14.920
is that there's all these
kids who have grown up

370
00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:19.840
now using this mobile thing
or seeing this mobile payment.

371
00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:22.030
It's not as new, the
same way you felt when

372
00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:25.060
you first saw me play
with the phone. This kids

373
00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:27.070
have grown up with that
as their normal thing. And

374
00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:29.200
so even the way they
are thinking of the future

375
00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:34.630
of payments is completely different
and completely revolutionary. If you

376
00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:37.180
think Bitcoin's is crazy, wait
and see what will come

377
00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:39.400
out of Africa in the
next four or five years,

378
00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:43.750
because you have grown up
with payments as, as a

379
00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:47.910
thing that happens in naturally
on their phone. So what

380
00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:50.820
will they come up with?
And already we're seeing bridges.

381
00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:53.790
We're seeing, you know, and
pass it to PayPal and

382
00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:56.070
back and forth people. That
being the whole point is

383
00:21:56.070 --> 00:22:00.390
being able to move money
smoothly. So then MOOCs can

384
00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:04.110
enable a, you said it's
a small to medium enterprise,

385
00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:07.110
small to medium company. If
I am a business person

386
00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:11.010
and I want to take
online payments, I sign up

387
00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:14.940
as a merchant with MOOCs.
I can do tickets for

388
00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:17.130
like an event, like, right.
I could have like a

389
00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:20.760
onetime event or a musical
event. I could sell my

390
00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:25.500
books, my PDFs, my digital
content, or even take donations,

391
00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:28.740
right. All on your platform.
So when I'm signing up,

392
00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:31.410
do I sign up for
an account? And then how

393
00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:32.820
do you get, how does
the money get from my

394
00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:35.480
SIM into my webpage? And
then, you know, I don't,

395
00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:39.180
I don't see how that
attaches. So when you think

396
00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:44.310
about the businesses and when
businesses move online, the first

397
00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:46.680
thing that, that you would
want to collect as a

398
00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:50.430
business online is the data.
And for us, it was

399
00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:53.250
how do we create a,
a means that this data

400
00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:55.830
from the payments. So this
person is going to pay

401
00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:59.190
from their wallet and send
this virtual text. How do

402
00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:02.310
we make sure that this
is coming into a dashboard

403
00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:06.990
that tallies with your product,
with your sale, with your

404
00:23:07.050 --> 00:23:11.040
event. So they're able to
see this by the money

405
00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:13.890
comes into an escrow account,
which you're able to see

406
00:23:13.890 --> 00:23:16.620
in your dashboard. And you
make a withdrawal all the

407
00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:23.670
way you transfer money from,
for example, our receiving account

408
00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:27.210
into your personal bank account.
So this is the same

409
00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:29.880
way the merchant would do
it is that they, they

410
00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:32.940
sign up into a system
that already has end to

411
00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:36.060
end payments plugged in. It
has a shop setup. So

412
00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:38.700
if you're selling an event,
you'd come sign up, create

413
00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:42.420
your account within this account,
begin to set up your

414
00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:45.770
event, put up your ticket
prices, set up your codes.

415
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:49.040
You're able to share this
to your social networks. And

416
00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:52.310
this is sharing directly to
a page that they can

417
00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:54.860
buy. So for us, it's
always, there's a lot of

418
00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:58.550
marketing that happens online. How
do you convert that marketing

419
00:23:58.550 --> 00:24:02.870
communication into an actual sale?
So to get this people,

420
00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:05.990
to see click buy, and
then in the backend, as

421
00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:08.210
a merchant or as a
small business, be able to

422
00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:11.300
look at one dashboard where
you're able to see this

423
00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:14.510
is the consumer who bought
this is their contact information.

424
00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:17.630
This is what they bought.
They have been repeat customers

425
00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:20.810
once or twice before, and
this is the amount of

426
00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:24.350
money they've paid. And I
paid this much of commission,

427
00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:25.880
or this is how much
I need to pay on

428
00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:28.550
transport. And the rest of
it is available for me,

429
00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:31.580
but it's something they manage.
And because from the system

430
00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:34.100
from MOOCs, they're able to
move it even as a

431
00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:37.640
business, back into their mobile
wallets. So as the person

432
00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:39.380
who's selling, I could then
see at the end of

433
00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:42.290
the day, I made a
hundred dollars move, the a

434
00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:46.370
hundred dollars to my mobile
wallet. And that happens instantly.

435
00:24:47.470 --> 00:24:51.010
Is there some JavaScript API
that you're using? Like, how

436
00:24:51.010 --> 00:24:52.720
does the, am I doing
this on my phone? Or

437
00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:55.000
can I do this from
my desktop computer as well?

438
00:24:55.700 --> 00:25:01.570
Well, 75% of our usage
is on mobile. And so

439
00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:04.900
a lot of our system
has been built mobile ready

440
00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:09.340
and mobile first as well
at the moment, some of

441
00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:12.760
the dashboards for the businesses
are still very desktop heavy,

442
00:25:13.390 --> 00:25:15.490
but that is part of
the development that we're doing

443
00:25:15.490 --> 00:25:17.440
now to be able to
ensure that even as a

444
00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:21.160
much, and you're able to
use your phone to run

445
00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:24.130
and manage your entire store,
but for the end user,

446
00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:28.990
for the customer, the entire
experience is mobile. Okay. And

447
00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:32.770
then how does the browser
on my Android or my,

448
00:25:33.610 --> 00:25:38.700
my, my iPhone know that
the SIM is there and

449
00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:44.350
authorize the money. So we,
we have, I mean, it

450
00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:47.470
took us about nine months
to develop a small online

451
00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:50.590
API that we use. And
what it does is by

452
00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:53.770
the form that you feel
as you're making your transaction.

453
00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:57.820
And we have a system
where we don't require the

454
00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:00.040
end user to sign up
it's it's, it was a

455
00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:04.480
big cause for cart abandonment.
So we took out that

456
00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:06.850
feature and every time you
want to buy something, you

457
00:26:06.850 --> 00:26:10.060
just put in your name,
email address, and phone number.

458
00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:13.960
And off of that form,
what the system does is

459
00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:15.970
that it will pick your
phone number. It will pick

460
00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:18.880
the transaction details. You're trying
to go buy one ticket,

461
00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:24.490
worth $5, and it will
automatically link into your SIM

462
00:26:24.490 --> 00:26:28.930
application and pop up a
menu that will say, you're

463
00:26:28.930 --> 00:26:32.980
trying to perform an online
transaction for this, because you've

464
00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:35.380
put your number. It just
reads into your phone number,

465
00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:38.020
reads into your SIM card,
pops up. I think that

466
00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:40.840
that prompts you for a
pin and you put in

467
00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:44.580
the pin and it automatically
the $5 out of your

468
00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:49.190
same wallet and complete the
transaction online. And it's something

469
00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:52.520
you watch happening in real
time. So I'm up here

470
00:26:52.550 --> 00:26:55.190
on the site right now,
and I'm shocked that black

471
00:26:55.190 --> 00:27:03.530
street and SWV are actually
playing SUV to come down

472
00:27:03.530 --> 00:27:07.460
there, but I'm impressed. Okay.
I'll tell you one thing,

473
00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:10.610
if you look at that
directory, so we set up

474
00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:13.520
a small directory or now
a page, because as much

475
00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:15.920
as we're not an aggregator,
we wanted to have a

476
00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:18.920
spot where we can showcase
all the different merchants that

477
00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:22.010
are using the platform. And
the one year and four

478
00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:26.180
months that we've been in
operation, we've had about 449

479
00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:31.160
much and sign up. Now
that's 449 new businesses that

480
00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:33.980
are going online for the
first time that are doing

481
00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:37.970
transactions online. For the first
time, they're bypassing the need

482
00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:41.120
for a physical brick and
mortar store, because some of

483
00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:46.130
these people are producing handcrafted
bags, hair products, things like

484
00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:49.790
those that they are able
to sell directly from manufacturing,

485
00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:52.790
send it to the customer
without having to go and

486
00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:56.180
pay Goodwill for a store
in town and stuff like

487
00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:58.850
that. So being able to
create that kind of impact

488
00:27:58.850 --> 00:28:07.730
means The future is. Yeah.
So I just tried to

489
00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:11.240
buy tickets. I must say
the VIP is a little

490
00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:15.340
expensive. It comes with a
dinner and free wine. Luckily,

491
00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:20.480
Is it dinner with SWV?
Because 10,000 Kenyan shillings is

492
00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:23.030
a lot of money And
you're going to get to

493
00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:25.850
see us WV and black
street out in Nairobi. Again,

494
00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:30.650
I respect that premium tax
Unless they're coming to pick

495
00:28:30.650 --> 00:28:32.720
me up. I don't know,
man, a lot of money.

496
00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:34.880
So I go in there,
I put my phone number

497
00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:37.640
in and there it is.
I enter, I go to

498
00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:42.230
my MSA menu. I select
Lipa, Pesa, pay bill business

499
00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:44.510
number, account number. I send
my money. And then like

500
00:28:44.510 --> 00:28:46.820
you said, in real time,
the money gets transferred and

501
00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:49.100
then you broker the deal.
And then I've got tickets.

502
00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:51.530
You got tickets in your
email and we send you

503
00:28:51.530 --> 00:28:54.590
a ticket and your text
messages as well. That was

504
00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:57.290
pretty slick. Are you going
to the conference? I am.

505
00:28:57.290 --> 00:28:59.030
I'm looking forward to it.
They just landed in the

506
00:28:59.030 --> 00:29:02.660
country this morning. So I'm
looking forward to this a

507
00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:06.950
lot, actually. And this has
been Jet lag. I don't

508
00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:08.930
know They're going to do
that. They've got that. They're

509
00:29:08.930 --> 00:29:11.180
used to it. This is
what they do. And one

510
00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:14.690
of the best things about,
about this platform is because

511
00:29:14.690 --> 00:29:16.910
we're a startup and we're
super young and we've been

512
00:29:16.910 --> 00:29:20.930
building throughout the entire time
that we've been live. A

513
00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:23.780
lot of our growth has
been organic. It's been, it's

514
00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:26.420
been good gigs like this.
A few months ago, we

515
00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:31.760
had aloe black here. We
had Kool and the gang

516
00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:34.970
here and being able to
do ticketing for them has

517
00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:37.880
opened up the Avenue to
be able to ticket for

518
00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:40.880
a lot more gigs. So
today it's black street, keep,

519
00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:44.790
you know, we're going to
bring everybody. That's pretty cool.

520
00:29:44.790 --> 00:29:47.190
So what, what does this
mean? Do you think then

521
00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:50.850
for like, let's say Americans,
let's say Europeans, who are

522
00:29:50.850 --> 00:29:54.840
watching this, are you all
gonna take over the world

523
00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:57.720
and we need to just
get ready? Or how do

524
00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:59.640
we, how do we get
involved? Does this mean that

525
00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:03.330
I can start taking, you
know, integrating into my business

526
00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:08.910
and then exploring Kenyan commerce
or African commerce? I feel

527
00:30:08.910 --> 00:30:12.750
that the opportunity is in
the fact that the internet

528
00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:15.120
that we are using now
is global and that the

529
00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:17.490
same things that you put
out, if you're a small

530
00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:20.670
business in the States, that's
looking to sell, I'll put

531
00:30:20.670 --> 00:30:24.510
t-shirts or sneakers, which the
culture has cuts across. If

532
00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:29.940
you're selling cooled sneakers in
the States today, a market

533
00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:34.770
or your audience is going
to be half American or

534
00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:38.160
European. And another part of
it will come from Africa

535
00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:40.470
because we have a billion
people. A lot of them

536
00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:42.600
are young. A lot of
them are in the same

537
00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:45.810
internet culture as everybody else.
And if you want to

538
00:30:45.810 --> 00:30:49.110
speak or tap into that
billion people, you're going to

539
00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:52.350
need a way that they
can pay you and you

540
00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:55.260
can receive their payment and
fulfill the order in a

541
00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:58.680
way that you're both trusting
and trustworthy. And that way

542
00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:02.340
is not going to be
a Bitcoin or a Cod,

543
00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:05.400
which have been in existence
for the last couple of

544
00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:09.390
years and require adoption. It's
going to be a format

545
00:31:09.390 --> 00:31:12.960
that will come from the
billion people up. And one

546
00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:16.530
of those is what we
have now. Very cool. So

547
00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:20.070
