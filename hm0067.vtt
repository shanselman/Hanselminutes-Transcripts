In this fourth episode of
Hansel, minutia, Scott, and crawled

9
00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:06.210
discuss recent technology changes and
upgrades. Hi, this is Carl Franklin

10
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.430
and you're listening to Hanselman.
It's from Hanselman it's dot

11
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.490
com. Here I am with
Scott Hanselman. How you doing

12
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.850
Scott? I'm well, yourself. I'm
great. Thanks. And this show

13
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.610
is a, another Hanselman new
show. We were deciding what

14
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.650
to do and what to
talk about. And there's just

15
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.300
too many little things that
are kind of newsworthy. Yeah.

16
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.920
I mean, we could though
we'll get back into some

17
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.770
dotnet stuff next week, but
it seemed to me that

18
00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.510
there were so many things
that could be talked about

19
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.850
that were not necessarily worth
20 minutes of our time,

20
00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.450
but you know, it's an
interesting week. Let's talk about

21
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.080
Apple first. Okay. Because there's
at least three things about

22
00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.280
Apple that we should talk
about. Yeah. Well, I guess

23
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.450
they went DRM free today
for EMI music. I just

24
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.940
fired up iTunes on my
box and was told that

25
00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.280
iTunes 7.2 appear Today being
May 30th, the recording date. All

26
00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.120
right, this is a Wednesday.
Yeah. And when you, when

27
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.200
you log in, they automatically
detect what music on your

28
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.830
system is from the EMI
publishing group. And they give

29
00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.010
you the opportunity for 30 cents
a song to upgrade them

30
00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:16.240
to two 56 K DRM
free AAC. There's another word

31
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.140
it's just straight, straight copies.
No copy protection, no, anything

32
00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.420
like that straight A's. This
would mean that my wife's

33
00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.720
Zune would be able to
listen to the EMI music

34
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.620
from my library. EMI is
taking a, you know, a

35
00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.820
bold step there by announcing
their DRM free. They, they

36
00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.440
basically seen the demise of
DRM and eroding people's confidence

37
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.460
in people's purchasing habits in
forcing people to pirate music.

38
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.190
I think this is what
happens. You know, the industry

39
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.230
is waking up to the
fact that DRM doesn't work

40
00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:49.700
Well. They just don't want
to be on the wrong

41
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.310
side of history. And I
know that DRM has caused

42
00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.610
me a number of headaches
over the years. I've constantly

43
00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.610
not constantly. A couple of
times I've had to call

44
00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:04.420
Apple. I hit that five
computers authorization limit, right? Because

45
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.970
I've upgraded a machine and
I forgot to de authorize

46
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.580
the computer before. And I've
always had that kind of

47
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.470
question in my mind that,
you know, what happens if

48
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.140
iTunes or Apple goes away,
or if some new format

49
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.600
comes out and I've got
all these songs that are

50
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.710
trapped in my, in my
existing format. So it's, it's

51
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:22.330
a start, but it sounds
like there's a couple of

52
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:27.820
glitches. There's some confusion about
you can't upgrade just an

53
00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.160
album or just a song
right now. It's all or

54
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.800
nothing. So you just take
all the EMI songs on

55
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.730
your system, times 30 cents and
you get one price, but

56
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.320
it might be an old
song I'm on all the

57
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.480
album. You're not interested in
listening to anymore. So that's

58
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.210
a little bit of a,
of a glitch. Also, they're

59
00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:47.260
going to still hold your
username inside of the song.

60
00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.540
So if you had the
ideas that you were going

61
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.690
to somehow throw all that,
now DRM free music that

62
00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.210
you purchased up on a
file sharing service. Your name

63
00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:56.890
is still going to be
in there, your Apple user

64
00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.800
name and personal information. Certainly
there'll be ways to strip

65
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.950
that out. But the point
is that the it's not

66
00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.200
quite, not quite there. And
it's certainly never going to

67
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.790
be appropriate to throw that
kind of music up on

68
00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.320
a file sharing service, but
it's a step in the

69
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.200
right direction personally. I think
I'm going to just hang

70
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.750
back and wait until all
of my music can be

71
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.140
converted to DRM free rather
than a, than being an

72
00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.360
early adopter on this particular
thing. But it's still, I

73
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.180
think it's a great move
and a more brilliance on

74
00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.050
the part of Steve jobs.
I agree. And it's ultimately

75
00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.180
a good business move to,
I think for everybody. Oh

76
00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:32.700
yeah. Also Apple announced today,
the iTunes U section of

77
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.580
the iTunes store, did you
see this right iTunes university?

78
00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.960
And this is a, a
place on iTunes that's dedicated

79
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:45.030
to free content, such as
course lectures, language lessons, lab,

80
00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.470
demonstrations, sports highlights, and campus
tours that are provided by

81
00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:55.140
us colleges and universities like
Stanford, UC Berkeley, Duke university,

82
00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.770
and MIT. Wow. That's interesting
because I've, I've got a

83
00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:03.240
bunch of lectures from MIT
that I had downloaded some

84
00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.370
of the, you know, the
classic computer science stuff that

85
00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.160
you can find right. Where
somebody filmed from years ago

86
00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.890
and they've got a lot
of free content up there

87
00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:12.890
and was at Stanford. That's
got a great deal of

88
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.380
free. Yeah. Stanford. There's a,
there's a website where they

89
00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.130
have just a ton of
video content from lectures. Interestingly,

90
00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.470
right now on the, just
at, at the time of

91
00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.290
recording, those URLs are broken.
I just tried to go

92
00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:27.090
to iTunes U and it
didn't work. I got a

93
00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:31.110
four Oh four, Well, this,
this came out today. So

94
00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.920
they they're either getting hammered
or they're fixing bugs probably

95
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.970
more likely. It's still a
fantastic idea. Yeah. It's going

96
00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.640
to make it easier. If
people can use the iTunes

97
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:47.580
process, the iTunes workflow for
putting this data around and

98
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:51.120
you've already seen a number
of universities decide to give

99
00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.760
away iPods. Yes. Just say,
you know, welcome to the

100
00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.030
university and here's your free
iPod. It's part of the,

101
00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.020
part of the process. People
have already kind of informally

102
00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.230
started to record lectures and
things like that. And now

103
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:05.990
they're gonna be able to
get those things. So getting

104
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.880
your homework, you know Exactly.
And you have a Mac,

105
00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:12.060
what kind of Mac do
you have? Okay. So I

106
00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.590
didn't actually end up buying
it. So what's going on

107
00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:17.710
is that I borrowed John
Lamb's Mac and I wanted

108
00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:21.650
around the rails conference showing
people demos of the, the

109
00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:25.150
dynamic language runtime. And I
wanted to borrow his Mac,

110
00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:27.460
not only because I was
excited about the DLR and

111
00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:29.260
Silverlight, but because I wanted
to see what it was

112
00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.330
like to really experience a
Mac. Now I do have

113
00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:34.780
a Mac mini, but it's
kind of a crappy Mac

114
00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.120
mini from six months ago.
It's not like the super

115
00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:41.380
Intel core two duo, but
John's is fully loaded. Three

116
00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:45.070
gigs of Ram core two.
And I, I filled it

117
00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:47.290
up with all sorts of
stuff that I probably shouldn't

118
00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:49.030
have. Cause it's a, he'll
have to uninstall it when

119
00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:52.180
he gets it. I put
on parallels and VMware fusion

120
00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:54.220
and I installed two copies
of Vista on it. And

121
00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.250
I've been doing some different,
different tests and stuff. It's

122
00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:00.730
the top of the line
Mac book pro that, that

123
00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:03.280
John loaned me and I
went to the Apple store

124
00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:05.680
and asked the guy if
I should buy. And he

125
00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:08.350
said, give it a week
or two, because the, the

126
00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:12.340
Apple developers conference WWDC is
going to be June 11th. And

127
00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:14.680
he says, just wait, whatever
you want to buy today

128
00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.660
is going to drop in
price 500 bucks. There'll be

129
00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:19.300
a new one. That'll come
out. You probably want that.

130
00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:22.770
One is what he said.
So I'm going to, I'm

131
00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:24.670
considering getting a Mac book
pro. I want to be

132
00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:26.470
able to run Vista on
it. And I tell you

133
00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:30.190
this, this parallels parallels is
one of the VM tools

134
00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:34.300
that the Apple has $79.
It's kind of their virtual

135
00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:38.830
PC. Wow. Really fantastic. The
thing that's really significant about

136
00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:41.530
it is that as a
compliment to boot camp boot

137
00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:43.690
camp is the dual boot
stuff that lets you own

138
00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:47.860
Vista on another partition. You
can partition your Mac half

139
00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:49.630
and half or whatever you
like. So you can have

140
00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:53.170
Apple on one Macko S
tan on one partition and

141
00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:58.660
this on another, but then
you can launch into <inaudible>

142
00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:01.690
run a virtual machine and
tell the VM that you

143
00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:05.200
want the disc it to
use to be the other

144
00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.290
partition. So you could do
a boot, leave something on

145
00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:12.130
your desktop, right? Like a
file. Do a boot again,

146
00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:14.470
come into <inaudible> run a
VM. And your file is

147
00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:16.990
still there. Wow. So you
can have the native speed

148
00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:21.580
running outside of macro S
10 running Vista natively, and

149
00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:24.760
then you can run it
in a VM. So I've,

150
00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:27.360
I've been using visual studio
on it, running orcas and

151
00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:30.430
having a blast. It's it's
a really great windows laptop.

152
00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:34.060
I've been really impressed. Now,
the other thing that was

153
00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:38.260
announced today was came from
Palm and shrinks.com P I

154
00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:43.300
five Palm introduced some sort
of new laptop Palm top

155
00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:46.360
thing. What is this? Yeah,
they call it the folio.

156
00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:50.650
I think that ARS Technica
said it correctly when they

157
00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:55.090
said, and their recent headline
Palm officially out of ideas,

158
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:59.610
1990s Palm top. Yeah. If
you've ever used the cyan

159
00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:02.550
or familiar with Saigon PSI,
O N was a British

160
00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:07.500
company, 1991 through 1994, came
up with some really amazing

161
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:10.100
stuff. That was like the
new kind of thing. Yeah.

162
00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:12.500
Well, it was like, it
was the anti new, it

163
00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.030
was the Newton, but it
was the anti Newton. So

164
00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:17.270
while Apple was innovating with
the Newton doing a slate

165
00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:21.860
style touchscreen, these guys felt
it was all about the

166
00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:26.960
clam top format. It was
a clam shell. Open it

167
00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.930
up with, with an almost
full sized keyboard. They started

168
00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:32.810
out with a small push
button keyboard, and then they

169
00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:35.480
came out with the siren
five. I think it was

170
00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:38.240
the five MX. Yeah, that
was the one I had.

171
00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:42.110
And this is like 96,
16 megs of Ram big

172
00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:45.410
wide screen. And it had
this amazing little keyboard that

173
00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:48.410
kind of came out of
nowhere. It folded open. And

174
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:54.170
the Palm folio is basically
a tiny laptop. Remember windows

175
00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:56.420
CE tried to do this.
I actually had a little,

176
00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:59.600
IBM. It looked like a
tiny ThinkPad. It was the

177
00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:06.250
IBM X 41. No, remember
this little tiny thing, it

178
00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.540
looked like it was I'm
trying to forget actually it

179
00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:12.310
was like an infant's ThinkPad.
Right. And it ran, it

180
00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.120
was gorgeous. And it was
a cute little thing. I

181
00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:15.920
had, I had one of
these that had 16 megs

182
00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.500
of Ram and it ran
windows CE and it had

183
00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:22.820
a little, a ThinkPad pointer
and it lasted forever. The

184
00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:25.370
batteries lasted forever, but it
had had pocket word and

185
00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:29.060
it had pocket Excel, Probably
they they're, they're really only

186
00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:33.470
telling us the folio has
three features, email attachments, and

187
00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:36.500
web browsing. I mean, those
are the details, you know,

188
00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:38.780
that they go into. So
it's really just an ad.

189
00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:41.720
They say, it's an add
on for your Palm and

190
00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:45.710
they're introducing it at four
99. So it's not like

191
00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:48.530
a full Well, and to
be clear, that's four 99

192
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:52.460
after $100 rebate. Oh, okay.
Well, so that means that's

193
00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:55.130
there, they're overtly eating a
hundred dollars there. So who

194
00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:57.620
knows how much it really
costs. But it's interesting if

195
00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:00.500
you take a phone on
the far kind of the

196
00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:03.020
far left of an imaginary
scale and you take the

197
00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:06.200
desktop replacement super laptop, like
the one that you've got

198
00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:09.260
on the far right of
that scale and you move

199
00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:11.540
kind of towards each other
while you've got people coming

200
00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:15.800
out with more and more
powerful sub notebooks, like the

201
00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:19.490
<inaudible> and the Sonys, and
some of the Fujitsu life

202
00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:22.340
books that are getting smaller
and smaller, full featured laptops.

203
00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:27.050
You've got the ultra mobile
PCs, the origami brand origami

204
00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:30.050
code name PCs from Microsoft.
A bunch of those, we

205
00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:35.360
saw mix very, very tiny
tenants' screens, almost look like

206
00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:38.870
a Newton, but they were
on Vista and that's heading

207
00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:41.030
to the left while on
the other side, they're from

208
00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:43.430
the left, heading off to
the right, you've got phones

209
00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:45.830
getting more and more and
more full featured. I saw

210
00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:49.820
a Verizon phone recently that
would flip, open vertically and

211
00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:53.710
flip horizontally and let you
watch television brother has one.

212
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:56.020
You know, the thing is,
I don't think this is

213
00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:59.170
going to work because the
middle size device is not

214
00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:04.060
good at doing either very
well. You know, the laptop

215
00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:05.860
is good when you have
a table, a place to

216
00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:08.620
sit and to work, or
you just have a chair,

217
00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:10.210
you open it up, you
put it on your knees

218
00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:13.450
or whatever. And the phone
is good if you're just,

219
00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:16.180
you know, on the train,
walking around, you know, in

220
00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:18.310
a, in a restaurant and
you want to know your,

221
00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:21.940
your spouse and your family,
you know, I don't think,

222
00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:25.090
I don't think a, a
mid sized device works well

223
00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:28.080
in either of those situations.
Right? I think when a

224
00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:31.830
device tries to be a
cop out or a companion,

225
00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:35.310
it's going, it's relegated immediately
to being a niche. I

226
00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:38.280
mean, basically they're saying here's
a tiny device that turns

227
00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:41.250
on really quick when the
screen on your phone is

228
00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:44.850
too small and it works
great with the poem. And

229
00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:48.030
if anyone's interested rather than
shipping with support for windows

230
00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:51.300
mobile and for Blackberry, we'll
leave that up in the

231
00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:53.430
air. If you care. It
seems to me like a

232
00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:55.500
more effective thing to do
would have been to make

233
00:12:55.500 --> 00:13:00.060
it more of a, a
more controversial shape rather than

234
00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:01.860
trying to look like a
laptop. I mean, it looks

235
00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:04.260
like it Tiny laptops and
therefore you're going to be

236
00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:07.350
disappointed when you find out
it doesn't have laptop feet.

237
00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:09.900
Exactly. So why not make
it not look like a

238
00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:11.820
laptop? Why not make it
look like an eight inch

239
00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:15.810
screen, a companion screen? You
know, the windows side show

240
00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:19.620
equivalent, just as windows side
show attempts to be tiny

241
00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:24.270
auxiliary devices for an auxiliary
screens for your laptop. Where's

242
00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:27.390
my giant screen. If I've
got a phone that already

243
00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:31.020
has a keyboard on it,
why not give me a,

244
00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:35.100
like a quote unquote, Bluetooth
screen and Bluetooth keyboard. Let

245
00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:37.500
the phone be the brain.
If the phone be all

246
00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:39.240
the, you know, the computer
make the phone smarter, the

247
00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:42.990
phone's already got two gigs
or VRA of, of SD

248
00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:45.930
card Ram. Right? I've got
one of these, a windows

249
00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:50.160
mobile, six devices from HTC,
and I've got a micro

250
00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.500
SD card. Have you seen
this card? I almost swallowed

251
00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:55.590
it. Yeah. It's very, very
tiny way too small. If

252
00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:57.510
you don't get it in
the device quickly, it'll blow

253
00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:00.120
away in the wind. The
device, I think has got

254
00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:02.340
a half gig of its
own plus the two gigs.

255
00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:03.840
So they go two and
a half gigs in a

256
00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:06.930
tiny little device like this.
Why do I need another

257
00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:10.050
device with screens and batteries
and buttons for me to

258
00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:13.350
manage? And it runs Linux.
I've got a device already.

259
00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:19.830
Where's my remote display protocol,
right? What, let that you

260
00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:21.840
know, sell the screen and
let it, let it be

261
00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:24.720
a companion in that way.
Then you might have, you

262
00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:26.850
know, imagine just having a
screen and a keyboard, a

263
00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:29.220
dumb terminal to your phone,
which is sitting in your,

264
00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:33.270
in your bank, you know,
Bluetooth, Bluetooth, remote desktop. Yep.

265
00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:37.290
This thing just seems like
it's neither an organizer nor

266
00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:39.630
a laptop. Now we're bad.
Mouthing is a device we've

267
00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:42.900
never seen, but it sure
seems like Palm. Well, we're

268
00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:46.050
badmouthing the idea. We haven't
seen the device. Sure. Right.

269
00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.330
But, but that all comes
down to, this has been

270
00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:53.090
done before. Right. Let's move
on a Microsoft surface. Now,

271
00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:56.930
this also was announced today.
And was it today or

272
00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:58.940
yesterday? I can't remember, but
I didn't see it in

273
00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:00.980
here. Anything about this yesterday.
So it must be today.

274
00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:05.450
Apparently there's been a team
inside of Microsoft. That's been

275
00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:09.530
working on this since 2001,
according to the website and

276
00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:13.580
they have a timeline 2001,
2003, four, five and seven.

277
00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:18.920
And this is a 30
inch diagonal display table. It's

278
00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:21.680
actually a table with a
glass table top that has

279
00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:25.490
a 30 inch monitor a
projector underneath and sensors on

280
00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:30.170
the sides and whatever. It's
the minority report machine. You

281
00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:32.180
know, that you can manipulate
with your fingers, with your

282
00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:35.720
hands. You take your fingers
and diagonally move them in

283
00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:39.320
different directions to zoom out.
You zoom in by squeezing

284
00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:43.040
your fingers together. One feature
that I I read about

285
00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:45.860
was great. That you can
take a camera that has

286
00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:49.010
a wifi adapter on it.
A digital camera just put,

287
00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:51.470
place it on the table
and all the pictures just

288
00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:55.010
sort of spill out of
it onto the screen. Like

289
00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:57.770
they have animations of your
pictures, just oozing out of

290
00:15:57.770 --> 00:16:00.350
the place where your camera
is, and then blowing up

291
00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:02.900
in spilling in a, in
a series, in like a

292
00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:06.160
pile of photos, Right. It
introduces a new kind of

293
00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:09.460
a more obvious metaphor. I
mean, I've always tried to

294
00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:13.540
explain to family members and
nontechnical folks that this is

295
00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:16.690
your desktop. This is where
your stuff lives. Right. You

296
00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:18.520
know, and try to explain
them the difference between the

297
00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:20.650
desktop and the filing cabinet.
You know, this is where

298
00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:23.680
you put your temporary stuff
and then your more longterm

299
00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:26.620
storage stuff goes here. But
that metaphor has always been

300
00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:31.360
a bit abstract. It's abstract.
It's one, it's one level

301
00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:34.750
removed because it's not your
finger, it's a mouse pointer.

302
00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:37.210
Right? So there's your hand
on the mouse? The mouse

303
00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:40.270
moves the pointer, the pointer
does the work, as opposed

304
00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:42.430
to your finger doing the
work. That's why I've always

305
00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:44.800
kind of preferred the idea
of a, of a tablet

306
00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:47.470
PC that used my finger
rather than a stylist. I

307
00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:50.500
remember being at VBS. I
think it was in the

308
00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:53.950
early nineties when Alan Cooper had
just come out with his

309
00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:58.180
book about face and he
asked the audience, what is

310
00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:01.900
the best pointing device we
have in somebody? You know,

311
00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:04.210
there's a bunch of answers
from the audience. And then

312
00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:07.600
he just held up his
finger, you know, and this

313
00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:10.840
is what we're talking about.
The finger is That's making

314
00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:14.910
the metaphor natural. Yeah, absolutely.
I mean like around here,

315
00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:17.410
you know, CheckFree the company
that just bought us. I

316
00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:19.840
saw one of their conference
rooms for video conferencing. And,

317
00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:21.970
you know, you could have
a screen with people up

318
00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:25.000
on it, showing the people
in another room, or you

319
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.150
could blow up the entire
wall and make it like

320
00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:31.480
a virtual portal through there.
And then if you could

321
00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:34.180
collaborate on that wall, you
know, and blur the line

322
00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:35.740
of where the computer is,
why do we have to

323
00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:37.750
look at all of the
work that we're trying to

324
00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:41.410
accomplish through these tiny <inaudible>
through these lenses of these

325
00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:44.140
metaphors, as well as these
tiny view ports, right? So

326
00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:47.680
the idea that rather than
having a, a 15 inch

327
00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:51.060
screen or a 17 inch,
and I have to, to

328
00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:54.510
visualize that this is a
desktop, you know, just take

329
00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:57.930
that whole monitor and make
it your desk. I think

330
00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:01.500
that while that sounds cool,
what you should see when

331
00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:04.430
you look@surface.com and it should
focus on are the, the

332
00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:07.470
ways that that could more
naturally interact with real things

333
00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:09.600
in the world. So like
the example you gave, you

334
00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:13.440
put a, put a device
on the table and then

335
00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:15.720
a circle goes around it
to indicate that it's found

336
00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:19.740
the device, right? And then
you could pick something up.

337
00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:22.920
Like you could look at
a map, take a number

338
00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:25.680
of maps would be a
fabulous. You could take a

339
00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:28.350
number of locations and then
pull those locations into the

340
00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:32.130
circle where your phone or
your PDA lives. And then

341
00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:35.040
they automatically get uploaded into
the device. It's a much

342
00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:37.980
more natural way of thinking
about things. Additionally, you could

343
00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:40.620
put a credit card down
on the table, right. It

344
00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:43.230
could then say, Hey, it's
Scott. And then I could

345
00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:46.140
look at a catalog of
things. Yeah. Pull them over

346
00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:48.270
to the credit card. They
could orbit it. Like they

347
00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:52.800
were in a shopping cart.
Yeah. And multiple people could

348
00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:54.720
potentially do that. So yeah.
There's nothing, this notion of

349
00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:59.010
multipoint, there's a rumor that
multi-point technology will be in

350
00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:02.130
the next version of OS
10. I think it's codenamed

351
00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:06.270
leopard, meaning multiple people could
be manipulating objects on the

352
00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:08.150
screen at once. Right. Right.
And this is something that

353
00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:10.610
I asked Microsoft for a
couple of years ago, few

354
00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:13.550
years ago now in a
blog post that I think

355
00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:16.340
got some play and some
traction. But anyway, I'm not

356
00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:19.220
the first one to think
of this is that, you

357
00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:22.700
know, what I wanted the
surface for was mixing, right?

358
00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:27.350
I mean, you have audio
engineers right now tend to

359
00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:30.740
like the hardware mixing desks
with the knobs that go

360
00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:34.130
up and down because it's
tactical. They understand the metaphor,

361
00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:37.490
they get it. Right. The
problem with digital audio mixers

362
00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:39.590
is that it's all like
on the screen with a

363
00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:43.520
mouse and you can only
pull down and move up

364
00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:45.770
one fader at one time.
So if you're in a

365
00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:48.830
live sound situation, you certainly
can't use that. What if

366
00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:50.720
you're in a live sound
situation you want to record

367
00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:54.530
on the, on the computer?
Well, you have to now

368
00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:58.850
use a outboard gear mixer.
But that means that that

369
00:19:58.850 --> 00:20:02.180
changes the color in the,
in the hardware that is

370
00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:04.850
processing the audio signal and
it takes it out of

371
00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:07.610
the computer. So you're in
the analog domain. Well, they

372
00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:10.910
have digital mixers too, but
that's a different story. So,

373
00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:13.100
so you would like to
be able to just put

374
00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:15.350
your hands on the screen
and you know, you got

375
00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:17.720
10 fingers, so let's put
eight of them on different

376
00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:20.690
faders and move them all
at the same time. Bruin

377
00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:23.480
bill said, you know, a
desktop PC on everyone's desk,

378
00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:26.780
a PC on everyone's desk.
Yeah. If right now they're

379
00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:29.600
starting by making this a,
you know, an entertainment and

380
00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:34.160
hotel and casino devices, people
who can afford the $10,000

381
00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:37.340
to, to make something like
this happen, but just There's

382
00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:40.040
a thousand. I think it
was 30,000, I think so.

383
00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:42.320
Yeah. Like it should be
that much considering that you

384
00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:45.440
can buy a 30 inch
screen from Apple for 1200

385
00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:48.820
bucks. If I install it
into a coffee table and

386
00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:50.260
add a touch screen over
the top of it, it

387
00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:52.900
shouldn't be 30 grand. Well,
I think that just means

388
00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:56.680
that someday I'll be able
to buy a $1,500 coffee

389
00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:59.320
table and make this happen.
So I'm just wondering if

390
00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:02.360
this means, you know, a
coffee table, surface PC and,

391
00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:07.850
and anyone's, and everyone House
certainly would be cool. The

392
00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:10.820
Microsoft research and looked at
them, Microsoft home on campus.

393
00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:14.490
Yeah. I was invited to
go out there and Richard

394
00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:16.710
went, but I didn't go,
I couldn't go. I had

395
00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:19.230
to work, but they've got
this Home where they've got

396
00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:23.520
a, a surface, like, experience
where you're basically preparing a

397
00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:27.090
menu and you ask for
a recipe and they project

398
00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:31.770
it onto your, on your
kitchen counter, basically following along

399
00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:34.290
with the recipe. That's awesome.
I mean, if you could

400
00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:37.560
think that every flat surface
in your house could potentially

401
00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:40.290
become a screen. Right. But
then you get into that

402
00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:43.500
kind of Idiocracy is a
movie about that. Where, you

403
00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:47.250
know, when, where, when did
the banner ads begin, right.

404
00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:49.320
When do you start having
popups on your, on your

405
00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:53.580
wall and a advertisement on
your kitchen counter? Yup. Looks

406
00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:57.750
like you're making brownies. Well
let's how are we going

407
00:21:57.750 --> 00:21:59.940
to wrap up the show?
We talked about a few

408
00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:02.220
things. So real, they really
sort of disparate things, I

409
00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:05.400
guess. I guess we could
just say, you know, thanks

410
00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:08.850
for listening. It's been a
minutia type show again. Yeah.

411
00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:10.980
It is random. Hopefully people
don't mind the mind that

412
00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:13.800
every once in a while
we have these rounding error

413
00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:17.160
shows where it's like, wasn't
enough to make a whole

414
00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:20.280
show on by themselves. But
these are the kinds of

415
00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:22.080
things that we're thinking about.
And if there's something that

416
00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:25.080
you're thinking about that you
think we haven't covered, you

417
00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:27.300
know, send me an email,
you know, my email address,

418
00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:32.700
it's justScott@hanselman.com. My first name
at my last name, hopefully

419
00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:34.470
the spammers. Won't be able
to figure that out with

420
00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:37.410
speech to text software, but
yeah, send me an email

421
00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:41.040
or go to my homepage,
enhancement.com and send us a

422
00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:42.390
note. I know we've got
a lot of things in

423
00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:44.430
the queue. We're going to
talk about ORM. I know

424
00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:46.350
that you guys over at
Dutton at rocks just did

425
00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:50.070
some or, or M discussion
object, relational mapping. I'm going

426
00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:52.170
to cover that a little
bit. Talk a little bit

427
00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:56.010
more about what's coming in
asp.net orcas. Some of the,

428
00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:59.520
the futures that are coming
in asp.net around Atlas. Yeah.

429
00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:01.050
I think we're going to
probably want to do a

430
00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:05.640
JavaScript library smack down a
little bit. jQuery. Talk about

431
00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:12.000
dojo is different libraries, Especially
dynamic JavaScript. That's interesting. What's

432
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.490
this dynamic JavaScript. Yeah. Can
manage JavaScript. Oh, DLR. You're

433
00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:21.030
talking about. Yeah. So the
using basically an ECMAScript running

434
00:23:21.030 --> 00:23:24.720
in the browser inside of
Silverlight and getting full.net support.

435
00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:28.110
Yeah. I think that's silver
light as a bridge between

436
00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:30.510
managed and unmanaged. JavaScript is
going to be really interesting.

437
00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:33.090
Should we talk about the
future of JavaScript? Because while

438
00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:36.600
Microsoft is off developing things
like the DLR, you've got

439
00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:41.820
Mozilla talking about including basically
a JavaScript compiler and you

440
00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:48.200
know, in a 100 or
1000 times faster JavaScript, Jitter

441
00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:51.830
running inside of Mozilla. So
more and more the browser

442
00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:55.010
is going to be smart.
And if the ECMAScript spec

443
00:23:55.010 --> 00:23:57.660
gets ratified, then it's all
that ratified. Then we're going

444
00:23:57.660 --> 00:23:59.270
to be in a really
good spot. Well, that's another

445
00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:03.020
show for now. Thanks for
listening. And thank you, Scott.

446
00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:14.390
<inaudible>.
