<inaudible>. Hi, this is Scott

8
00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.720
Hanselman. This is another episode
of Hansel minutes today. I'm

9
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.690
chatting with David <inaudible>. He's
a video game designer, a

10
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.840
producer, a programmer, and he's
best known as a co

11
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.470
founder and president of blizzard
North and help make the

12
00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.860
successful video game company behind
titles like Diablo and Diablo

13
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.890
two. How are you, sir?
I'm doing quite well. Thank

14
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.900
you. This is great. I'm
glad to be chatting with

15
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.800
you. You, you have a
company now called gray beard

16
00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:15.110
games.com. Yeah. Which looks just
like you that's cause it

17
00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.440
is me. Is it just
you? Is it like a

18
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.440
boutique? It is. It is
just me. I am. After

19
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.680
working on large teams for
a long time, I'm kind

20
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.580
of going back to my
roots and doing a one

21
00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.490
man project here where I'm
doing every part of it.

22
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.670
I'm doing everything from the
coding to the design, to

23
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.150
the arts to music. Really?
Okay. That was where I

24
00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.950
was going to ask. He
didn't outsource a little bit

25
00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.830
of art or maybe get
a little subcontractor to do

26
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.610
some music. This is every
pixel, every note. Yes. Every,

27
00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.320
every bit of it, you
know, I've, I've been programming

28
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.040
for a very long time,
but art is definitely something,

29
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.860
a little new. And so
I took some online courses

30
00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.920
and been practicing for a
little while and, and finally

31
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.020
decided to, to give it
a go and we'll see

32
00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.850
how it turns out. I
think it's looking pretty good.

33
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.030
If you don't mind. I
want to just double click

34
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.350
on that for a second.
Cause I think that people

35
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.770
who listen to the show,
listen for inspiration, listen for

36
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.280
new topics. But you sir,
as someone who's been programming

37
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.800
for the better part of
30 plus years who created

38
00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.610
a Diablo just said that
you took some online courses.

39
00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.520
Yeah. I mean, there were,
there were courses for art,

40
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.550
they weren't for programming, but
the, but yeah, I think

41
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.830
that that can help a
lot. Anytime that you want

42
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.540
to study anything, I feel
like getting advice from experts

43
00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.730
is the way to go.
That's the best way to

44
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.110
learn. And, and so there's
nothing embarrassing or anything about

45
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.190
taking online course. I learned
more that way in a

46
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.280
quicker time than anything else
that I could, that I

47
00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.500
could have done on my
own. Yeah. I appreciate that.

48
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.420
I want people to know
that because I think that

49
00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.700
people follow their favorites on
Twitter or they find out

50
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.700
that someone has a Wikipedia
page and then they, you

51
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.190
know, they think this is
a rockstar programmer. And I,

52
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.130
I do believe that there
are, you know, maybe 10

53
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.560
X programmers occasionally, but it's
a rare thing. But I

54
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.650
think that when we deify
programmers, because they did something

55
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.380
cool online, we forget that
they're humans, that they're sitting

56
00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.320
at their desk sometimes alone
in front of one to

57
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.780
three monitors taking an online
course, trying to figure out

58
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.000
how to do a layer
and Photoshop. Yeah, absolutely. That's

59
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.130
great. I'm glad because I
just want people to know

60
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.980
that because I don't people
shouldn't beat themselves up. Oh

61
00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.150
no, absolutely not. Again, you
know, we're first time you

62
00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.420
do anything, you're not an
expert. Right. I don't remember

63
00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.450
the exact phrase, but it's
the, you know, it takes

64
00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.090
a thousand hours to become
an expert at anything or

65
00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.770
10,000 hours. So it's a,
you know, the only way

66
00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:52.050
you're going to learn is
by trying, and there is

67
00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.720
no such thing as failing,
it's just a learning experience

68
00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.430
and you just keep getting
better and better at something.

69
00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:57.960
And the more you practice
it, the better you'll be.

70
00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.270
Yeah, definitely. I like to
say you gotta be agile

71
00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.020
about your failures, right? Fail
fast fail often. Yeah, absolutely.

72
00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.690
So let's, let's take it
back then. 20 plus years,

73
00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.480
you did. How many games
before you were the lead

74
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:18.180
programmer on Diablo? Geez, not
many, maybe maybe five to

75
00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:21.870
five to eight games before
that. But I had been

76
00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.010
programming for a long time
since the early eighties, when

77
00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.760
my dad brought home an
Apple two plus, and that's,

78
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.370
I taught myself to program
when I was in sixth

79
00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.510
grade. Do those, did those
skills, do those skills build

80
00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.360
on top of each other?
Like you've got 10 years

81
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.260
behind you when you're doing
Diablo, but you're still, you

82
00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.370
know, in your twenties, is
that, what is that doing

83
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.590
in your brain? How is
that preparing you for success

84
00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.510
to do something big? You
know, I think that it

85
00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:59.640
did, it definitely builds upon
previous experience. Just like anything

86
00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.100
else, right? The more that
you learn, the more you

87
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.440
more comfortable you are with
it, the more that you

88
00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.030
get new techniques and stuff,
you can use those techniques

89
00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.060
to, to build upon something
that you couldn't do before.

90
00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.620
And, and so I think
that the baseline of, Oh,

91
00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.770
I've taught myself, you know,
Apple soft, basic. And then,

92
00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.340
then I learned six, five
Oh two assembly language. And

93
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.670
you know, then I was
able to, Oh, I can,

94
00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.610
I understand how assembly language
works. Now I'm going to

95
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:34.050
school. And I'm taking this
course on programming on a

96
00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.840
PDP 11 or whatever, and
all of these things. And

97
00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.240
so they kind of build
upon each other and then

98
00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.120
come forward to Diablo and
it's like, Oh, I need

99
00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.720
to write really fast drawing
routines. And the only way

100
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.490
I'm going to do that
as an assembly language. But

101
00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.320
if I hadn't had those
skills, I wouldn't be able

102
00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.800
to get the performance that
I needed out of Diablo

103
00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:55.830
Diablo's rendering. Yeah. Did you
know that someone is doing

104
00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:00.110
a modern reimplementation Diablo? No,
I didn't. I didn't know

105
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.330
that. I mean, it doesn't
really surprise me that much.

106
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:07.430
It's been extraordinarily popular. And
so a lot of people

107
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.680
would like to see kind
of modern versions of that.

108
00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.130
No, well, this, this is
a student and what they're

109
00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:16.450
doing is they're taking the
original Diablo data file. That

110
00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:21.910
<inaudible> file. And they are
reimplementing the engine to learn

111
00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:25.300
so that they can load
up that, those resources and

112
00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.820
then do the, do the
brains of the thing. And

113
00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.890
they're doing it. They're actively
doing it's on GitHub. I'll

114
00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:31.330
send it to you. They've
been working on it for

115
00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:34.000
a couple of years now.
That's a really cool, I

116
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.950
think that that's definitely a
way that people can learn

117
00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:39.220
how games are made and
become an ex more of

118
00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:43.120
an expert at making games
is understanding how people that

119
00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.570
have done it and been
successful at it and do

120
00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:49.090
this for a living. Hey,
I can kind of reverse

121
00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:52.840
engineer this and understand their
techniques and stuff to allow

122
00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:56.890
them to become better at
making games. When you started

123
00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:59.380
out with Diablo, was there
ever any concern that it

124
00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:01.960
would, that aspects of it
wouldn't be possible technically from

125
00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:05.620
the resolution to the number
of things happening? No, I

126
00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.380
don't think that that was
ever really a, you know,

127
00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.080
a concern. I think that
really, it was more of

128
00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.420
a concern at the time
was the fact that the,

129
00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:19.690
the industry was just starting
to change and many games

130
00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:22.900
were starting to go 3d.
And instead of a kind

131
00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:26.020
of two D pixel art
and our game was kind

132
00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:30.250
of a hybrid in that
everything was 3d modeled, but

133
00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:35.110
then the, we rendered them
all to sprites to little

134
00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:39.460
sheets where we could condense
the art into pixels and,

135
00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:45.070
and display, and then redisplay
them later. And so, you

136
00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:48.670
know, the original source art
was made with 3d tools,

137
00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:52.060
but the actual rendering was
done in two D. So

138
00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:53.620
there was, there was kind
of, it was kind of

139
00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:57.310
a hybrid approach, but I
knew that it wouldn't be

140
00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:59.920
possible to get the kind
of action and the speed

141
00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:03.550
and the look that we
wanted out of pure 3d

142
00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:06.160
at the time, I just
was not gonna be technically

143
00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.790
possible. So we didn't even
never reach for that. And

144
00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:14.830
so then, you know, that
was, I think that that

145
00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:18.220
was, that was never really
on the, on the horizon.

146
00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:20.590
The biggest technical hurdle that
we had when we had

147
00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:22.600
the ABA one is that
I had never made a

148
00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:28.240
multiplayer game before. And so
when we started, you know,

149
00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:31.270
working on the game and
the, the people, the parent

150
00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:34.750
company that was doing a
lot of the funding of

151
00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:39.130
the product said, you know,
Hey, it's multiplayer, it's multiple.

152
00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:42.040
Yeah, sure. It's ready for
multiplayer. I say, and then,

153
00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:44.440
you know, I didn't know
anything about that at all.

154
00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.840
And so when it came
time, then six months before

155
00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.030
we were going to publish
the game, they came up

156
00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:53.110
with this idea of Battlenet,
which is this a way

157
00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:55.980
for people to hook up
over the, and play with

158
00:08:56.010 --> 00:09:00.060
each other, doing a peer
peer model where you just

159
00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:02.040
send them their IP address,
you guys hook up, and

160
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:05.850
then you, then you play
with each other where everybody

161
00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:10.200
kind of lock steps to
the game. And it turned

162
00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:13.230
out that, you know, I
didn't have anything prepared for,

163
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.670
for a multiplayer. And so
I think that technically, that

164
00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:19.590
was probably the biggest hurdle
that we had to overcome

165
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:21.840
when we were making the
one was the fact that

166
00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.570
I had no experience making
multiplayer things and the game

167
00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:26.970
was really not prepared for
that. And so we had

168
00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:29.820
to go back and, and
spend a bunch of time,

169
00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:31.980
maybe in the last six
months. In fact, we had

170
00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:35.340
some people come up from
blizzard, South the headquarters down

171
00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:38.250
in Irvine, came up to
the Bay area and worked

172
00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:40.800
on the product with us
to teach us how to

173
00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.290
make multiplayer games and stuff.
They had a lot of

174
00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:49.350
experience making Warcraft and stuff,
multiplayer games before. So we

175
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:50.910
learned a lot. And with
that, we were able to

176
00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:54.600
actually implement and do a
lot of the, the coding

177
00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:58.860
ourselves for Diablo two. When
we changed the model to

178
00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:02.120
client server, instead of peer
to peer, How do you

179
00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:05.300
test something like Diablo, where
there's many, many hours in

180
00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:08.420
it, you've got the multiplayer
aspect, is it manual testing

181
00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:10.970
where you just have, I
don't know, young people and

182
00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:12.560
a lot of pizza and
they just test it. Was

183
00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:14.390
there any kind of automated
that you make it so

184
00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:16.550
you could automate elite tape,
play the whole game back

185
00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:21.080
to front. So the that's
kind of a tricky question

186
00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:23.570
because there, the answer is
yes, to pretty much all

187
00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:26.990
of it. One of the
biggest problems with Diablo is

188
00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:29.750
that it has from a
testing standpoint, is that it

189
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:34.400
had so many random variables.
And so the levels are

190
00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:38.000
randomly generated. The items are
re randomly generated. The monsters

191
00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:41.300
are randomly generated. And because
of all of this randomness,

192
00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:44.330
you ran into situations you
wouldn't maybe never even see

193
00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:50.690
again. And, and so finding
bugs that are extremely rare,

194
00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:55.100
under weird seeds and weird
conditions was very, very challenging.

195
00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:57.440
So we came up with
tools that allowed us to

196
00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:00.410
iterate through a bunch of
items or a bunch of

197
00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:04.310
levels and, and kind of
be able to make sure

198
00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:06.290
that, Hey, I can traverse
all the way through this

199
00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:09.590
level, or I can, you
know, this item isn't broken

200
00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:12.260
and we could just hit
the space bar or something

201
00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.030
like that, and look at
a bunch of levels or

202
00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:16.010
look at a bunch of
items and make sure that

203
00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:18.320
they're all working in and
try and find bugs that

204
00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:22.370
way. Nonetheless, they still, you
know, some things fell through

205
00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:26.360
the cracks and whatnot, but
then that was a different

206
00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.190
type of testing. And that's
kind of the brute force,

207
00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:30.260
Oh my God, we've got
all of these, all of

208
00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.170
this random content that who
knows what it's going to

209
00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:35.180
do. And so we have
to test it, test that

210
00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:38.480
stuff in kind of an
automated fashion, but their actual

211
00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:41.210
gameplay in the balance and
all of that, you can't

212
00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:44.930
really, you can't really simulate
that very well. You really

213
00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:47.150
have to play through it
from the beginning. And that,

214
00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:49.400
that is where the, the
pizza and lots of man

215
00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:52.970
hours come in, where you're,
you're iterating on something over,

216
00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:56.890
over again, and actually playing
the experience because there's nothing

217
00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.620
you can't really simulate that
experience, especially with all the

218
00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:02.320
randomness, different things would happen.
And they would end up

219
00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:05.440
in different situations and different
levels of power and things

220
00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:08.680
like that at different points.
And so trying to really

221
00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:11.110
hone that in just took
hours and hours of time.

222
00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:15.540
No offense is intended by
this question, but do you

223
00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:16.890
ever look back on it
and just go, wow, I'm

224
00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:18.600
surprised that whole thing worked
as well as it did.

225
00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:26.760
Oh yeah. Every day. Yeah,
absolutely. Yeah. It, you know,

226
00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:30.960
I, I think that we
were, you know, young and

227
00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:34.140
bright eyed and it's pretty
amazing that it all came

228
00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:37.440
together. We were very fortunate
for all of these, you

229
00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:39.960
know, I think that luck
definitely has something to do

230
00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:42.330
with it. And the fact
is that, that we were

231
00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:44.220
a bit lucky that we
came out with the right

232
00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:46.710
thing at the right time
and, and it had kind

233
00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:49.830
of a magic touch and,
you know, it's, it's, it's

234
00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:53.370
tough to do. And we're
still very fortunate that it

235
00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:56.100
all worked in that, that
it spoke to a bunch

236
00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:59.700
of people. So you didn't
expect, or you weren't prepared

237
00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:02.850
for multiplayer, but you made
that happen. Something else happened

238
00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:06.120
that was interesting. In 1997,
there was an expansion pack

239
00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:09.840
that came out called Diablo.
Hellfire was an expansion pack,

240
00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:12.540
just a patch, or was
the system built in a

241
00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:15.630
modular way that it could
expect an expansion pack in

242
00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:20.820
the future. It was built
in a fairly modular fashion.

243
00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:25.500
We allowed for the inclusion
of extra tile sets and

244
00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:29.220
monsters and, and, you know,
item types and things like

245
00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:31.860
that. It was all data-driven.
Most of our, most of

246
00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:37.320
our data was done in
Excel. Actually we would, you

247
00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:39.570
know, do a lot of
the lot of the data

248
00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:43.770
was just in this giant
Excel spreadsheets. And we were,

249
00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:46.470
here's an item spreadsheet and
a monster spreadsheet and things

250
00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:48.210
like that. And then we
would just export it to

251
00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:51.060
text and then be able
to import them into the

252
00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:53.400
game. So adding new tile
sets or new monsters was

253
00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:56.670
just a matter of adding
stuff to it, to, to

254
00:13:57.930 --> 00:14:02.250
lines of Excel. And so,
you know, I think that

255
00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:05.490
we, in that way, it
was very modular, but the

256
00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:11.640
expansion itself, you know, going
past a Diablo and having

257
00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:14.010
new levels and things like
that, there was quite a

258
00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:17.790
bit in there that was
kind of centered around the

259
00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:20.100
idea that that Diablo was
going to be the end.

260
00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:23.940
And so changing that and
whatever needed needed some updating,

261
00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:26.580
but I'd say a great
majority of the content was

262
00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:30.750
able to go in without
much trouble. Nice. There is

263
00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:34.620
a pitch deck up at
gray beard games called Diablo

264
00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:38.460
pitch dot PDF. It's a
it's as condor incorporated 1994.

265
00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:40.440
And at the very, very
end of it, it's got

266
00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:45.240
this Gantt chart that shows
your plans about how long

267
00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:48.930
it would take you to
make this. And it's, it

268
00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:51.890
says, it says about 12
months and it says, yeah,

269
00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:53.930
you know, month, three and
four, we'll have the first

270
00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:56.300
level down. And then you
basically go, yeah, these additional

271
00:14:56.300 --> 00:15:01.700
levels, character's music testing. You're
testing only has three months

272
00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:04.370
for testing. Did you pull
the whole thing off in

273
00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:08.230
12 months on this game?
Oh, not even close. It

274
00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:10.900
took, it took two years
and of the a, the

275
00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:14.410
last year, it was probably
eight months or so of

276
00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:20.680
pretty hard crunch. That's awesome.
Okay. I appreciate you being

277
00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:23.350
such a good sport about,
about these things. It's important

278
00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:27.100
that people understand how, how
it all comes together is

279
00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:29.380
never as pretty as the,
as the tails behind it.

280
00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:34.480
Absolutely. I've never been on
a project that we estimated

281
00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:37.450
the right amount. Usually it's
around double. What I, what

282
00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:40.390
I would think would be
the worst case scenario. And

283
00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:41.920
I don't know why that
is. Maybe I'm just an

284
00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:45.730
optimist and I believe in
my abilities more than the

285
00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:49.480
reality, but I think that
the reality is that things

286
00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:53.440
just happen. Plans change, like
the game that we pitched

287
00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:58.960
in the Diablo pitch document
was single player. Turn-based dos

288
00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:02.320
operating system, et cetera, et
cetera. There are a bunch

289
00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:05.920
of things about it that
that changed. When we finally

290
00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:08.920
shipped the game, it turned
into a real time game,

291
00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:11.830
which required more animations and
a whole bunch of new

292
00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:15.610
ways for the game to
work. It was multiplayer instead

293
00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:19.060
of single-player, it was in
windows using direct X instead

294
00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:22.900
of dos. And these were
all important and good and

295
00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:25.690
the right decisions to make.
But every single one of

296
00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:30.580
those things, you know, made
the project bigger. And so

297
00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:36.250
still taking basically double the
amount of time. I think

298
00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:38.590
we did a pretty good
job at actually releasing a

299
00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:41.980
product in such a short
period of time under, under

300
00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:45.010
with all of these kinds
of changes. Yeah. Given feet,

301
00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:48.070
that's pretty intense feature creep.
Yeah, it is. It is.

302
00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:53.230
What's weird though, in games,
oftentimes, you know, you can

303
00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:56.770
design something, designing something in
it, as far as gaming

304
00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:59.920
is concerned is very difficult
because you never have all

305
00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:03.730
of your best ideas at
the very beginning. And so

306
00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:07.600
when you actually are playing
something, you oftentimes can say,

307
00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:11.080
Hey, it's important that we're
gonna change this. Or this

308
00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:14.710
feature didn't work. Like we
wanted it to, and we

309
00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:17.020
need to do something different
because this is just not

310
00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:20.800
fun or it doesn't fit
the game correctly or whatever.

311
00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:24.490
And so oftentimes there's a
very iterative process to making

312
00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:28.540
video games. That's why it's
extremely difficult to actually predict

313
00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:31.840
when the game is going
to be done, because who

314
00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:34.810
knows, you know, they, they,
you try and get your

315
00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:39.220
best judgment going, invest guests,
but in the end, it's,

316
00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:43.630
it can be pretty radically
shifted. Especially the game itself

317
00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:46.180
can turn out to be
something different than you had

318
00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:50.670
planned in the very beginning.
Yeah. There's a great Documentary

319
00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:53.430
on YouTube, kind of a,
a retrospective. I just, I

320
00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:54.810
sent that to you on
Twitter. It sounded like you

321
00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:57.420
hadn't seen it before where
people were exploring what happened

322
00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:00.540
at the time. And that
switch from turn-based to real

323
00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:04.340
time was pretty significant design
change. Oh, absolutely. It was

324
00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:08.150
huge, but it was huge
in terms of not just

325
00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:10.370
because it was going to
be more work, but it

326
00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:15.200
was just so revolutionary and
really separated the game and

327
00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:18.980
made it very unique. And
that, so it was obviously

328
00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:22.400
once we had tried it
and, and played with it

329
00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:24.980
in and said, Oh my
God, this is so much

330
00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:28.850
better screw all the plans
at this point. This is

331
00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:31.070
definitely the way we've got
to go, because this is

332
00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:33.770
just so much better than
the previous way we can't

333
00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:36.680
go back. And, you know,
we talked about it with

334
00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:41.510
the guys down South at
blizzard headquarters and they, and

335
00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:43.940
they agreed. They said, look,
it doesn't matter that it's

336
00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:46.430
going to take longer. This
is the right decision. This

337
00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:48.860
is going to be a
better product. And, and so,

338
00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:51.800
you know, we paid the
price in terms of man

339
00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:54.350
hours, but at the same
time, it was worth it

340
00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:57.770
in the end because the
game became very different than

341
00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:00.950
the other things that are
out there. So coming back

342
00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:03.860
to the, to the present
day, this is a question

343
00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:06.710
that I've asked kind of
other people, you know, quote

344
00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:11.480
unquote, famous people. Who've worked
on something big before. What

345
00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:13.310
do you do? And how
does it feel when you

346
00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:18.140
basically hit a home run
early in your career? Is

347
00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:21.830
there daily, yearly, ongoing pressure
to hit home runs? Every

348
00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:26.570
year I talk, we talked
to a DHH, this kid

349
00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:29.870
that made a Ruby on
rails, hit a home run

350
00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:32.900
when he was like 20.
And then, you know, you're

351
00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:36.290
40, you know, you're almost
50 then, is there pressure

352
00:19:36.290 --> 00:19:38.030
to like hit a home
run? Or can you just

353
00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:40.490
be happy with that and,
and do your own thing

354
00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:42.980
and make games every year
that are maybe not as

355
00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:47.150
successful as Diablo, but still
amazing. Yeah. I think that

356
00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:51.110
that trying to hit home
runs is, is it's a

357
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:56.540
dangerous, dangerous game. And I've,
I've gone through that where

358
00:19:56.540 --> 00:20:01.190
I tried to back up
my success with, of Diablo

359
00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:04.310
with another product called Hellgate
London, and it did not

360
00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:08.990
go as well. And you
know, that, that was quite

361
00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:14.240
the learning experience for me.
And I, you know, I

362
00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:16.850
realized at the time that
what I really need to

363
00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:19.160
do is I need to
make sure that number one,

364
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:23.210
I'm happy. I'm happy with
my products. I'm happy with

365
00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:25.880
my life. I'm happy with
the way that I'm doing

366
00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:28.910
things. And I go about
making a game that I

367
00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:31.850
want to play that's that
I believe will be fun

368
00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:35.360
that people will enjoy. And,
and, but is making me

369
00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:39.380
happy doing it because, you
know, there's, there's too much

370
00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:41.840
pressure out there to, to
hit a home run. The

371
00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:44.120
fact of the matter is
that hitting a home run

372
00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:48.550
is extremely difficult and there
are very few people that

373
00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:50.410
ever get the chance to
hit a home run. So

374
00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:51.910
the fact that I actually
got to hit a home

375
00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:54.880
run and maybe two, if
you count the elbow and

376
00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:58.270
the elbow too, I think
that that is that's, you

377
00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:01.900
know, that's incredible. And I
will always be very grateful

378
00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:06.280
for what, for that experience,
but to expect that of

379
00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:09.190
myself every single time, I
just don't think it's fair

380
00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:11.950
to anybody. And it's just
too much pressure on yourself

381
00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:15.130
instead, be happy with what
you're doing and be proud

382
00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:17.800
of what you make and
do the best you can.

383
00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:20.350
And if it works out,
it does, if it doesn't,

384
00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:23.950
it doesn't, but you know,
you always have that, the

385
00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:26.530
fact that you have hit
a home run as something

386
00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:29.950
that can be a shining
star on your, your, your

387
00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:34.000
career. And so that's, that's
something that I always be

388
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.240
really grateful for, but actually
thinking mean to do that

389
00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:40.440
again, is, is hard to
hard to imagine. No, it

390
00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:42.750
sounds like a very healthy
attitude at the same time

391
00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:46.260
though. Well, well, Hellgate, London
might not be a game

392
00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:49.740
that our listeners are like,
you know, familiar with in

393
00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:51.540
the sense that it's not
part of like the cultural

394
00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:55.650
zeitgeists, there were still novels
made about it. There's they're

395
00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:59.220
actively, I guess, making a
VR version, even now 10

396
00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:03.300
years later, the IP is
out there floating around. Yeah,

397
00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:07.200
absolutely. It's it's, you know,
it turned out fairly successful.

398
00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:10.800
It was not critically acclaimed
at the time, but now

399
00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:13.590
that it's been, you know,
whatever, it's been now 10

400
00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:18.300
plus years since it came
out, it, I think that

401
00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:20.820
there's a lot of people
who feel, Hey, it turns

402
00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:23.520
out that Hellgate London though,
the hype was so big

403
00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:25.950
and it didn't leave live
up to those expectations turned

404
00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:29.280
out. It had quite a
few pretty revolutionary things in

405
00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:31.710
it that are used today.
And it kind of paved

406
00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:34.020
the way for a bunch
of kind of first person

407
00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:37.770
RPG hybrid stuff like destiny
and things like that that

408
00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:42.180
are out now and, and
borderlands and some other games

409
00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:45.180
like that. And so I
think that the idea was

410
00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:48.780
very sound and very solid.
And people looking back on

411
00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:52.710
it now, maybe little through
Rose colored glasses say, Hey,

412
00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:56.670
it's still around. It was,
it was really ahead of

413
00:22:56.670 --> 00:22:59.190
its time, but you know,
it didn't deliver on the

414
00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:03.900
promise that w that everybody
had expected of it when

415
00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:05.820
it first came out, but
in the end, it turned

416
00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:07.930
out that it wasn't that
bad of a game. Yeah.

417
00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:10.770
Yeah. I mean, if you
leak in looking back with

418
00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:13.230
both the history on our
side, but maybe a little

419
00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:15.780
bit of Rose colored glasses,
it looks, you know, there's,

420
00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:18.870
there's pieces of Skyrim in
there. There's, you know, people

421
00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:21.780
have looked at that in
bar borrowed number of aspects

422
00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:24.690
of it. And certainly when
you played, you know, doom

423
00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:27.600
three VR today, you say,
wow, this sure looks familiar.

424
00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:30.600
So it's not just about
the concepts, it's the mechanics.

425
00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:34.650
Yeah, absolutely. And, you know,
that's very flattering. And I

426
00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:37.560
think that, that a lot
of people tried it. So

427
00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:41.610
it definitely was a situation
where people were influenced whether

428
00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:45.030
or not it's directly or
indirectly through their experience of

429
00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:49.490
these different types of, of
games and including Hellgate definitely

430
00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:52.900
had influences on games in
the future. For sure. So

431
00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:54.760
what, what, what is the
genre of the game that

432
00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:57.700
you're working on now, and
do you deal with the

433
00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:00.040
home run by just going
in an entirely different direction?

434
00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:02.710
Or do you try to
refine the design concepts that

435
00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:06.970
you've built up over the
last 20 years? I, you

436
00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:09.250
know, I don't want to
make a game that can

437
00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:11.740
directly compete with the things
that I've done in the

438
00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:15.040
past, because a that's not
fair because it's just me

439
00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:20.920
and a and B you
know, but I don't wanna

440
00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:22.870
make that same game in
a lot of ways. I

441
00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:26.230
want to do something a
little bit different. So that

442
00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:28.600
said I'm using a lot
of the experience and a

443
00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:30.910
lot of things that I've
done in the past to,

444
00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:34.300
to help make the design
decisions that I'm using this

445
00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:37.780
time, all of the randomness
and things like that, that

446
00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:42.280
are, that I'm very kind
of famous for. And I've

447
00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:46.420
done throughout my career, random
items and monsters and things

448
00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:49.210
like that are definitely part
of this new product. And

449
00:24:49.210 --> 00:24:52.690
so using that experience and
building upon that wisdom of,

450
00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:55.510
of years and years of
making these kinds of games,

451
00:24:56.410 --> 00:24:59.560
he's kind of skills and
what good affixes are and

452
00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:02.320
things like that. Like I
I'm able to draw upon

453
00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:07.060
that knowledge and then use
that in a new way.

454
00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:10.630
And so I'm, I'm excited
in that there's still lots

455
00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:12.790
of randomness and a lot
of things I'm very familiar

456
00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:16.780
with, but the perspective and
the, and the, the game

457
00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:20.350
itself is very different than
something that I've done before

458
00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:24.850
in. So it's kind of,
it, it's, it's still an

459
00:25:24.850 --> 00:25:29.500
RPG, but, and it's still
very action oriented, but it's

460
00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:33.010
not like Diablo. And so
in a lot of ways,

461
00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:37.150
it's kind of like a,
if you'll get a lot

462
00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:39.220
of taste of Diablo in
there and you'll see that

463
00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:42.040
it's definitely a game that
I would design, but at

464
00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:44.560
the same time, it's, it's
different than something I've done

465
00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:47.170
before. So it's hard to
explain what genre it is

466
00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:51.970
because I don't really know.
It's kind of it's, I

467
00:25:51.970 --> 00:25:55.600
would still say it's an
action oriented RPG is really,

468
00:25:56.650 --> 00:25:59.920
it speaks the most to
it. Can you speak a

469
00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:02.140
little bit about the technologies
that you would choose? Because

470
00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:03.700
I think people out there
who might be thinking of

471
00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:06.700
making a game would like
to know, well, I'm creating

472
00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:08.440
a game. Am I going
to put it on steam?

473
00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:09.820
Am I going to put
it on Gog? It, will

474
00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:12.010
it go on a Nintendo
switch? How, you know, how

475
00:26:12.010 --> 00:26:14.140
many platforms do I want,
or should I just write

476
00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:17.230
the game on one platform
and then worry about others

477
00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:20.050
if it becomes successful? Yeah.
I think that that's the

478
00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:23.200
approach that I'm taking is
the latter there, which is

479
00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:27.040
let's focus on doing one
thing, right. Rather than, you

480
00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:33.220
know, five things mediocre. So
it's very difficult to, to

481
00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:35.950
make sure that your game
runs on tons of different

482
00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:40.150
platforms all the time, especially
when it's just myself. You

483
00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:42.730
know, it's a, it's a
much bigger project when you're,

484
00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:46.350
when you're something like that.
So I'm focused specifically on

485
00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:50.460
making a PC game, integrating
it with steam and maybe

486
00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:54.120
Gog and th and like
things like that to do

487
00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:57.810
the distribution. But the main
focus right now is focused

488
00:26:57.810 --> 00:27:00.870
on making it a PC
game that said, I've also

489
00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:03.570
coded a lot of stuff
to make sure that it's

490
00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:06.270
ready so that when I
want to put it on

491
00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:11.220
other platforms, I've abstracted enough
stuff that I can make

492
00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:14.220
that transition a lot easier.
I'm not going out of

493
00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:16.980
my way to write all
of the little extensions to

494
00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:19.620
different platforms, but I am,
you know, set up so

495
00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:22.770
that I could swap out
routines to be for different

496
00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:26.870
platforms and things like that
pretty easily. Are you using,

497
00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:28.700
are you using unity or
may I ask what you're

498
00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:35.060
writing? I wrote everything from
scratch. Yeah. I, I, I've

499
00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:39.170
always been that way. The
real reason that I'm writing

500
00:27:39.170 --> 00:27:42.650
everything from scratch is because
they're, I don't think there's

501
00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:44.690
an engine out there that
can do the things that

502
00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:47.690
I want the game to
do. And so that, that's

503
00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:52.640
a bold statement. Well, yes.
And maybe it is, but

504
00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:55.850
no disrespect, none at all,
none taken. It's just that,

505
00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:59.390
you know, the, the type
of game it is, it

506
00:27:59.390 --> 00:28:03.410
was best for me to
write my own engine for

507
00:28:03.410 --> 00:28:06.560
this, rather than use one
that already exists. I mean,

508
00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:08.540
I know how to do
it, and I have it

509
00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:13.010
running at about 700 frames
a second. So I think

510
00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:18.320
that, you know, it's paying
off in that it's, you

511
00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:21.410
know, it's got the feel
and the speed that I

512
00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:25.130
want to make sure that
I'm delivering a good experience

513
00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:29.660
for everybody, but Given how
high up above the metal

514
00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:33.500
that we are today, you
know, back in the day

515
00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:37.070
you wrote the outflow in,
in C and assembler. Yes.

516
00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:40.790
So now we don't necessarily
have to do that. And

517
00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:44.120
we've got two, three, four
orders of magnitudes, more power.

518
00:28:44.510 --> 00:28:46.340
Would you choose to go
and still do it and

519
00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:48.260
see in a similar, or
do you do it in

520
00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:50.900
a higher level language? And
then when you do that,

521
00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:53.420
how, how low level do
you go? I guess what

522
00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:55.820
I'm trying to ask is,
Hey, it's 2017. I'm going

523
00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:57.710
to write a game first.
I'm going to write a

524
00:28:57.710 --> 00:29:03.410
Ray tracer from scratch. You
couldn't do that. I don't,

525
00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:06.650
I wouldn't recommend that. But
How far down to the

526
00:29:06.650 --> 00:29:09.650
metal did you go to?
Right. I, you know, I'm

527
00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:13.640
just using calls to direct
acts. I mean, right now

528
00:29:13.670 --> 00:29:17.450
it's using direct X, but
you know, it can be

529
00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:22.640
open GL or something like
that. But so I, I've

530
00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:25.010
gone down to kind of
that level of where it's

531
00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:28.160
getting everything ready for the
video card to do a

532
00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:32.750
lot of the rendering, you
know, that that's kind of

533
00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:36.890
where it stops. Like I'm
letting direct X or open

534
00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:39.980
GL do, do its thing
rather than then going any

535
00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:44.230
further than that. So, you
know, I, I originally I've

536
00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:47.620
always been in favor of
I'm kind of old school.

537
00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:50.860
I don't really like high
level language is very much,

538
00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:54.070
I like having more control
and most more speed. I

539
00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:55.960
grew up in an era
where it was just super,

540
00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:59.530
super important when you're making
games to be the fastest

541
00:29:59.530 --> 00:30:02.620
thing you could be. And
so anything that isn't the

542
00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:06.610
fastest it could be for
me just feels bad. So

543
00:30:07.150 --> 00:30:10.300
the way that I enjoy
making games the most is

544
00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:13.360
to be, you know, be
writing things that I think

545
00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:17.710
are very efficient and very,
very fast. And that allows

546
00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:21.610
me to spend my resources
on doing different things than,

547
00:30:22.390 --> 00:30:25.750
rather than making a, a,
a game that spending a

548
00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:30.210
bunch of time using an
interpreted language or something. So

549
00:30:30.270 --> 00:30:34.020
back to schedule, you had
said that, you know, Diablo

550
00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:35.190
was going to be a
year and then it was

551
00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:37.590
two years, but it turned
out amazing. But at the

552
00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:39.810
same time, really it was
done when it was done,

553
00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:41.790
is the same thing gonna
apply to your new game?

554
00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:45.960
Oh, I think that I
would like for it to

555
00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:48.570
be that way, whether or
not we'll be that way,

556
00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:51.870
who knows, you know, I
think that that attitude is,

557
00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:55.770
is fine when the company
or whatever has tons of

558
00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:59.040
money and resources and backing
of bigger companies that are

559
00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:03.190
going to support you through
thick and thin. But the

560
00:31:03.210 --> 00:31:06.600
fact of the matter is
that, you know, reality is

561
00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:11.250
that sometimes we have to
adhere to deadlines because we've,

562
00:31:11.250 --> 00:31:14.250
you know, that's how much
time and money we have

563
00:31:14.250 --> 00:31:17.390
to do to make it.
So it feels a lot

564
00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:19.320
in a lot of ways
that games are never really

565
00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:22.320
finished. In my opinion, it's
like a lot of other

566
00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:26.250
apps that you can constantly
iterate on it and improve

567
00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:28.110
it and make it better,
and then patch it. And

568
00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:30.450
especially in this day and
age, it's easier than ever

569
00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:33.960
to patch things and improve
them and, and get feedback

570
00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:37.080
from a community and listen
to them and, and incorporate

571
00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:39.420
their feedback and, and what
not. And in fact, it's

572
00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:42.150
pretty vital to the way
that games are made today

573
00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:47.460
to, to really kind of
create that, that community and

574
00:31:47.490 --> 00:31:50.280
involve them in the process
of, of making a game

575
00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:56.310
better and better. And, and
so, because of that, you

576
00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:58.560
know, when's it done? When
is it not done? It's

577
00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:01.980
really hard to, it's really
hard to tell and you

578
00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:04.530
have to just be okay,
this is the point which

579
00:32:04.530 --> 00:32:06.240
I'm going to release it.
It's good enough at this

580
00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:08.850
point. And so from here
on out, I'm going to

581
00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:14.100
try and, you know, still
improve the product, but this

582
00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:17.190
is good enough to be
called release. So you've been

583
00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:20.010
a little quiet on your
blog and a little quiet

584
00:32:20.010 --> 00:32:22.920
on your website. Are you
in stealth mode? Where can

585
00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:24.900
people follow you and learn
about what's going on, or

586
00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:26.970
at least watch for when,
when it's time for your

587
00:32:26.970 --> 00:32:29.520
game to come out? Yeah,
they can. They're welcome to

588
00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:33.780
follow me, David Breivik on
Twitter. And then my gray

589
00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:37.890
bear games, that's gray with
an, a gray beard games,

590
00:32:37.890 --> 00:32:42.470
and that that's on my
website. I have a blog

591
00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:47.180
there where I just didn't
game jam along about a

592
00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:49.970
year ago. And that's about
the last update that on

593
00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:53.930
there. And I'm hoping to
discuss the new game very

594
00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:56.120
soon. And so a lot
of the Twitter stuff and

595
00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:59.540
the blog and, and my
personal account will all be

596
00:32:59.690 --> 00:33:02.530
talking about those things here
in the near future. Very

597
00:33:02.530 --> 00:33:04.870
cool. And I would definitely
encourage folks that are listening

598
00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:07.660
to, to take a look
at the old man game

599
00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:11.560
jam, David stream, 30 hours
and on Twitch. And he's

600
00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:13.660
got it all up in
an archive on YouTube. So

601
00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:16.750
if you want to watch
a game being created, you

602
00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:19.570
can see that in a
solo game jam with David.

603
00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:22.210
Thanks so much for chatting
with me today. Oh my

604
00:33:22.210 --> 00:33:25.060
pleasure. Thanks so much. I
enjoyed it a lot. This

605
00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:27.640
has been another episode of
Hansel minutes, and we'll see

606
00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:28.570
you again next week.
