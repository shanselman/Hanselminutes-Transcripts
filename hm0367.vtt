end developer Garren means about
developer model culture. Hi, this

9
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.320
is Scott Hanselman. This is
another episode of Hansel minutes

10
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.930
and I've got Garren means
with me today. How are

11
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.320
you? I'm good. How are
you? Brilliant. Although not as

12
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.070
good as you, because apparently
you, I was asking you

13
00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.650
what you were working on
and you are you're. I

14
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.020
said fun employed, but you
have something even more interesting

15
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.080
going on. Well, I don't,
I don't know. I don't

16
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.950
know if it's, it's exciting.
Definitely. I'm I'm traveling around

17
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.080
speaking at conferences while I,
because I committed to that

18
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.870
before leaving my previous position.
And so I didn't want

19
00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.990
to start a new position
having already committed to do

20
00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.200
that. So That seems super
fun though. How is that

21
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.540
different than like, you know,
a lot of these people

22
00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.600
are doing this journeymen thing
where it's like, quit your

23
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.000
job and then just couch
surf and code your way

24
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.530
across the planet. I, well,
I'm not making any money.

25
00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.040
So that primarily it's that.
So like all of this

26
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.610
is like stuff that, that
either conferences have very kindly

27
00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.390
sponsored for me or, or
I'm outlaying the cash for

28
00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.290
like random things like pet
sitting and taxis myself. Yeah.

29
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.810
It's definitely hard. I don't
think one can really make

30
00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.460
a living running around speaking
most conferences. Don't don't give

31
00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.500
you anything other than conference
food. Oh, I, I think

32
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.170
a lot of the conferences
I've been lucky to be

33
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.420
involved with like give you
like and fair and like

34
00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.940
a hotel. So that's great.
It's like, of course free

35
00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.440
travel, but yeah, it definitely
doesn't. Doesn't satisfy your, your

36
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.780
day to day needs back
at home. Yeah, exactly. I've

37
00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.730
talked to a number of
people who think that somehow

38
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.430
I'm making piles of money
speaking at conferences. I'm like,

39
00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.060
no, you know, coach airfare
domestically and the holiday Inn

40
00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.500
is about as exciting as
it gets recently. You did

41
00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.080
a talk at a conference
called bacon is bad for

42
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.840
you. What conference was that
at? That was at a

43
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.600
devil of bacon in London.
It was, that was actually

44
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.320
the name of the conference.
Yeah. Deb's love bacon. Yeah.

45
00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.860
Was the conference about bacon?
No, it, it was about

46
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.770
The subtitle was things developers
love. So it was about

47
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.080
all kinds of things. And
I saw amazing talks about

48
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.550
like music theory and travel
hacking and just a variety

49
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.180
of things that you could
potentially geek out over. Oh,

50
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.800
like, like kind of like
life hacks, just like, yeah.

51
00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:18.330
Kind of like wave packs.
That seems like a very

52
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.430
exciting conference. The only thing
is I don't eat bacon.

53
00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.470
I don't eat any pork.
Oh, none at all. Yeah.

54
00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.630
My wife doesn't eat pork.
So when we got married,

55
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.030
we made an agreement. It's
funny what the deal is.

56
00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.350
I don't drink and she
doesn't eat pork. So when

57
00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.470
we got married, we traded.
So now neither of us

58
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.170
eat pork and we don't
drink. So if we went,

59
00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.750
if I had to, I
did a post recent Iceland

60
00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.600
recently, maybe a year or
two ago about alcohol at

61
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.900
conferences. And I started going
to some, some kinds of

62
00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.740
conferences, but you know, by
10 30, 11 at night,

63
00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.370
everyone's drunk. Yeah. And that
just made me really uncomfortable.

64
00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:58.920
So I just was like,
you know, can we just

65
00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.800
not have any alcohol at
a dev conference for once

66
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.260
in our lives? And a
lot of people really did

67
00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.020
not agree with that. And
I kind of got Dogpile

68
00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.720
Don. And now I was
at a, I was at

69
00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.410
a really good conference recently
called code mash. And they

70
00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.950
had a bacon bar. Like
it was just a bar

71
00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.020
that served nothing but bacon.
And I found, it felt

72
00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:22.410
like it was a little,
little, much. Yeah. I think

73
00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.140
JS comp does it as
well. They have like, or

74
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.940
at least one year that
I went, they had, they

75
00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:32.230
had just piles of bacon
in, in burners. So, so

76
00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.510
then you're at a conference
called devs, love bacon, doing

77
00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.600
a talk called bacon is
bad for you and you

78
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.060
don't even eat bacon yourself.
So what is this talk

79
00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:47.090
about? And It wasn't really
about bacon. I just, I

80
00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.380
actually submitted the talk because
of the name of the

81
00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.120
conference, sort of a play
on it. But it was,

82
00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.710
it was more about the
idea of, of the things

83
00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.640
that developers love and like,
what are those things doing

84
00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.770
for us? And are they
helping us in like, does

85
00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.500
that sort of way of
defining a developer by the

86
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.770
things he or she loves
does, is that helping us?

87
00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.850
What should we be defining
a developer by? Like, I've

88
00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:15.600
always thought that what Linus
said, talk is sheep talk

89
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.510
is cheap. Show me the
code. Yeah. Was the really

90
00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.850
the best way. And then
when I have, when I

91
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.820
do talks on diversity or
have conversations with people on

92
00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.880
diversity, I always say that
code doesn't really have a

93
00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.780
gender or a race. And
while I, while I admire

94
00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:35.010
diversity and I strive for
diversity of, of diversity of

95
00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:38.220
thought, ultimately I just want
to know if it compiled

96
00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.850
and passed the test. Yeah.
I think that, I think

97
00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:44.160
that's exactly it like a
developer, somebody who writes code.

98
00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:47.550
Okay. So then that kind
of takes a talk like,

99
00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:51.000
or a conference called what
developers love and just makes

100
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
it about code. Then it
kind of basically says the

101
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.940
premise of the entire conference
that you're at is wrong.

102
00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.500
Like let's all watch big
bang theory and, and star

103
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.670
Trek. I don't know. I
don't know if I would

104
00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:05.860
say the premise of the
conference was right. I mean,

105
00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:07.810
it was still, it was
still a fun conference, but

106
00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:11.350
I, I wanted to talk
about the, like most of

107
00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:13.360
the talks I saw at
the conference were like about

108
00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.450
things that, that are not
such sort of memes in

109
00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:19.000
the developer community, which was,
which was cool. They were

110
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.100
just random things you could
geek out about. But there,

111
00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.630
there definitely are like, you
know, like star Trek is,

112
00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.210
is when I mentioned a
lot in the talk things

113
00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:30.940
that I think you're sort
of expected to like as

114
00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:34.360
part of your identity as
a developer, and maybe that

115
00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:39.100
is not such a great
way to define developers. Isn't

116
00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:41.950
this, the definition. And I'm,
we're not dog piling on

117
00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:43.960
this conference. If anyone listens
to this, I hope they

118
00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.480
understand that this is about
the larger issue and not

119
00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.790
in any way about this
particular conference, which sounds like

120
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:50.980
a super fun conference to
go to awesome coffee. Yes.

121
00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.430
Please invite me to come
to this conference, but doesn't

122
00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:58.540
this promote monoculture. He doesn't
just basically say, you know,

123
00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.850
if you don't like star
Trek and if you don't

124
00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:03.090
like big bang theory, and
if you don't, you know,

125
00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:07.270
you can't quote a Babylon
five, then you're probably not

126
00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:09.970
going to be good at
programming. Yeah. I think, I

127
00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:13.250
think that's exactly the danger
that, that we, we, we

128
00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:17.950
conflate the cause and effect
there and what's actually relevant

129
00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:21.520
because we get so used
to sharing those things with

130
00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.610
the people around us. And
like, we, like most of

131
00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:27.370
us when we started out,
like we, we got that,

132
00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.950
like that impression really strongly
that we were supposed to

133
00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:32.680
be that kind of person
until it enables us to

134
00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.380
relate to each other really
easily. And so then when

135
00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:39.200
we're in any kind of,
not sitting down with literally

136
00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.790
the hands, like keyboards coding
situation, it's an easy way

137
00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:45.430
to be like, Oh, we're
we're buddies. We're like part

138
00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:48.790
of the same team go
developers. It makes me think

139
00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:51.520
about young people who are
thinking about getting into programming,

140
00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:54.760
because it almost says you
can't be a well rounded

141
00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:59.830
individual if you choose this
vocation. Yeah, exactly. That was,

142
00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:03.190
that was totally my feeling
as well, like that you,

143
00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:06.010
whatever, whatever your identity is
outside of that, like you're,

144
00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:09.040
you're supposed to kind of
suppress, and I've definitely noticed

145
00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.950
that happened, like where people
have have interests that are

146
00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:17.050
considered, like, especially if they're
considered non-serious like people will,

147
00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:19.660
I don't know, just, I
guess, just laugh at you,

148
00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:22.960
which is, which is not
super, like not a big

149
00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:26.980
deal, but it, you definitely
get the message that you're,

150
00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:29.920
you're not supposed to talk
about your non serious interests

151
00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:34.960
in certain circles. I also
noticed that some technologies can

152
00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:39.250
chop themselves up their culture's
up based on age. So

153
00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:42.730
I'm a.net guy. And there's
the, the kind of the

154
00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:46.330
joke about like old.net people
and their kids. Right. You

155
00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:50.470
know, like everyone's over 35
and has kids, well, like

156
00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:53.980
the node community is early
twenties and you know, the

157
00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:58.440
Ruby people have certain style
and personality and there's a

158
00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:02.160
lot of free hugs. And
these kind of like this

159
00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:07.890
clumping occurs within, within code
tech, within code, which makes

160
00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:09.870
me feel like, well, maybe
I'm too old to go

161
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:12.540
and become a node person.
Or maybe I'm not, I

162
00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:15.510
don't, I don't do enough
vintage clothing. So I shouldn't

163
00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:18.230
be a rubious or, you
know what I mean? And

164
00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:20.040
like, Oh, I don't want
to do.net. Those people are

165
00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:23.100
like, they've given up on
life and they work for

166
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:28.520
Aflac or something. I would
imagine Affleck's actually very good

167
00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.980
to work for. I would
suspect they'd probably have good

168
00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:34.460
disability, I would think. Yeah.
But I totally know what

169
00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:37.550
you mean. Like I I'm,
I'm in my mid thirties,

170
00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:40.880
myself and being a front
end person and JavaScript person.

171
00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.180
I definitely noticed that everybody
around me is for the

172
00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:47.060
most part in their twenties,
which is a little weird.

173
00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:49.430
And it makes me wonder
if I'm immature for my

174
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:54.020
age. Well, does doesn't that
make it that much more

175
00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:56.780
difficult to put yourself out
there? And I don't necessarily

176
00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:59.480
mean speaking, but just, just
showing up to work and

177
00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:04.160
presenting yourself, you know, who,
you're not one of us.

178
00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:09.980
I don't know. I think
it's, it's again, going back

179
00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:13.700
to that idea of an
adopted identity. Like I I've

180
00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:16.400
learned to fake it. Like,
I, I, I've sort of

181
00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:20.060
learned to take, to keep
up with, with things like

182
00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:22.730
that, that the kids are
into so that I can,

183
00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:24.680
you know, like I can,
I can still be a

184
00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:27.320
part of those communities, but
on the other hand, like

185
00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:29.840
I have the things that
I do on my own

186
00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:32.020
that, like, I don't really
talk about it in those

187
00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:34.910
communities, like working on my
house or like the importance

188
00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:37.460
of like my pets in
my life. Well, like a

189
00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:39.410
lot of developers I know
who like fly all around

190
00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:41.840
the world don't have pets
or like children or like

191
00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:44.480
spouses or anybody that they
have to, they have to

192
00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:48.190
be concerned about like leaving
at home. And like, I

193
00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:52.310
don't know, it's, it's, it's
different, but like, it's definitely

194
00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:55.310
there definitely is that segmentation
there. And like, you definitely

195
00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:59.270
have to, like, I think
adopt the traits of whatever

196
00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:02.930
that segment is to, to
fit into something. Yeah, yeah.

197
00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:06.350
Yeah. I did. I did
a blog post once on

198
00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:11.480
square foot gardening for programmers
and then like all these

199
00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:14.480
like older married couples, just,
Oh, this is amazing. I

200
00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.730
didn't know. I thought we
were the only ones I

201
00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:18.650
thought we were the only
ones that loved square foot

202
00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:21.020
gardening. And you did it
from a programmer point of

203
00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:23.180
view. And then at the
same time, I'll have people

204
00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:25.820
unfollowing me for tweeting about
my kids. You know, it's

205
00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:28.730
like, you know, I'll just
put some harmless tweet out

206
00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:30.530
there. It's a day at
the zoo with the kids

207
00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:32.150
and then pictures of the
kids. And I was like,

208
00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:37.520
Oh, unfollowed, not enough technical
meat. Okay. Okay. That's a

209
00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:43.250
little unfriendly. They're hipster. Why,
why don't we like hipsters?

210
00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:48.230
Oh, I, I, my, my
theory is I can't remember

211
00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:50.360
all the points that I
had on the slide right

212
00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:54.310
off hand. But you said
they were unfriendly. Yeah. Basically

213
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:58.330
unfriendly know-it-alls would, would sum
it up very well. Yeah.

214
00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:03.090
And much like, Yeah, of
course. Except we're older experience

215
00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:07.140
get off my lawn unfriendly,
not at all. But I

216
00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:08.310
think that one of the
points that you made in

217
00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:11.670
the talk was that punishing
people for the wrong interests.

218
00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:14.040
And I think we see
that if you've ever seen

219
00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:18.150
Portlandia it's, it's like, you
know, you're in, you're in,

220
00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:20.040
you're in Austin and I'm
in Portland. So it's this,

221
00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:23.190
this kind of hipster central.
Yeah. But you know, if

222
00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:24.690
you, if you don't, if
you didn't read that article

223
00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:29.040
in the new Yorker, and
then, then you're not the

224
00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:34.170
right kind of people who,
who do we want to

225
00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:36.510
join our communities and what
do we need to do

226
00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:39.600
as a, as people who
are talking on a podcast

227
00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.000
or people who are arguably
out there in public to

228
00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:44.820
let people know, Hey, the
water's fine. Come in. We

229
00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:47.490
want you in our community.
We want differing point of

230
00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:53.250
views and we want non
bacon eating people. Well, I,

231
00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:57.090
my feeling is that one
of, one of the issues

232
00:12:57.090 --> 00:12:58.980
that we have is we
don't want people to join

233
00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:02.190
our community because that dilutes
the idea that we're all

234
00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:06.180
really kind of these special
geniuses, if, if just anybody

235
00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:09.450
can, can join. And so
I think we, we like

236
00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:12.960
to set up sort of
this, not quite hazing, but

237
00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.840
like something like it before
we allow people into the,

238
00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:19.200
the core of like whatever
our community happens to be.

239
00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:22.680
And, and when, when really
what we should be looking

240
00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:25.900
for is just everybody who
has the capacity to, to

241
00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:28.440
write code, because that's how
we get that diversity of

242
00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:31.950
ideas and experience. And then
we become better coders. We

243
00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:37.290
write better software, et cetera.
So I think we have,

244
00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:39.900
we have a real problem
of motivation in terms of

245
00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:42.780
getting people into coding. And
there's a lot of lip

246
00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:46.230
service paid, but when it
comes down to it, like

247
00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:49.410
what we're looking for, people
like us who validate the

248
00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:52.050
idea that we're supposed to
be here, and it's some

249
00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:55.560
sort of birthright. And I
think that's, that's my own

250
00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:57.300
suspicion. I don't have anything
to back it up, but

251
00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:00.090
that's how it feels to
me. That's an interesting idea

252
00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:03.390
though. The, the, the birthright
comment, that's a, that's a

253
00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:07.710
word with a lot of
emotional baggage to it, but

254
00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:10.680
there are, and of course
we're talking in general generalisms

255
00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:13.500
generalizations, but the idea like,
you know, I was, I

256
00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:15.930
was oppressed in high school
and you know, this is

257
00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:18.060
my right, you know, I'm
smart, I'm smart. And this

258
00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:20.250
is what I was born
to do, you know? I

259
00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:22.020
mean, I don't know about
you, but I definitely had

260
00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:25.110
that feeling when I kind
of discovered that I had

261
00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:27.480
some ability at this. It
was like, ah, here we

262
00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:31.200
go, revenge. Right? This is,
this is how it's going

263
00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:34.080
to happen is that I
have this superpower. Right. You

264
00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:35.940
know, you're, you're beat up.
And then you get bit

265
00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:40.170
by the radioactive spider and
now everything is going to

266
00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:44.550
be okay. But also the
idea that there is no

267
00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:48.240
payoff or at least in
the short term for bringing

268
00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:52.640
people in that have diverse
interests, right. Is the code

269
00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:54.110
better? I don't know. We'll
have to go and build

270
00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:57.620
a crim incredibly diverse and
exciting team in order to

271
00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:00.830
see. I've never seen any
studies on that. Like, you

272
00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:04.670
know, we have fewer, a
fewer tests failures because our

273
00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:09.430
team has diverse interests. Right?
Yeah. I think it's one

274
00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:12.730
of those things that I've
certainly seen studies saying that

275
00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:15.940
the groups perform better with
a diversity of ideas and

276
00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:19.480
backgrounds. I feel like you
can extrapolate that to say

277
00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:22.210
that you're, you're, you're just
going to have better planning

278
00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:25.540
when, when everybody isn't sort
of school to have the

279
00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:28.660
same ideas and the same
approaches, like you'll, you'll plan

280
00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:31.630
your software projects better, which
will lead to better code

281
00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:34.030
and like better like division
of labor. When you have

282
00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:36.730
people who are interested in
doing different parts of the

283
00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:41.530
system, all kind of working
together. But yeah, I've never

284
00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:43.690
seen any studies either. It's
just something I feel in

285
00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:47.110
my heart Is that enough
though, for us to make

286
00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:50.410
a more welcoming community that
we just, we know in

287
00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:52.300
our hearts, this is the
right thing to do. Therefore

288
00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:55.310
we should try to be
more welcoming. Well, I, for,

289
00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:57.730
for technical people, I would
say probably not. I think

290
00:15:57.730 --> 00:16:01.570
we probably need some metrics
behind that, but, but that

291
00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:03.820
of course implies that, that
we, we find that we

292
00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:07.060
find a widely diverse pool
of people with all kinds

293
00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:09.430
of interests and put them
in a room for a

294
00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:12.280
couple years and see what
kind of software they're able

295
00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:16.210
to produce, assuming that they
all get treated equally as,

296
00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:19.540
as developers. And we don't
sort of keep the classic

297
00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:21.880
developer who watches star Trek,
like on a, on a

298
00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:26.500
pedestal. And I think that
would be very difficult thing

299
00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:33.910
to, to actually test out,
unfortunately. Hmm. The, in the,

300
00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:37.120
in the talk you were
going on about how the

301
00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:40.780
caricature has become very public
now, like our little group

302
00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:45.340
has, has people watching us
now, like we remember the

303
00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:47.920
revenge of the nerds movies
and things like that. And

304
00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:51.940
that was kind of a
pocket protector slide rule, kind

305
00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:55.120
of a nerd, but the
stereotype is now kind of

306
00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:59.110
been, been owned and now
I've been repackaged and turned

307
00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:02.410
into, into television and movies
and stuff like that. The

308
00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:10.340
character is completely public now.
Yeah. Is that okay? I

309
00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:12.670
think it, it bothers me
a little bit. I actually,

310
00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:15.460
I was just on a
plane back from a conference

311
00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:18.580
and I watch every watched
the social network on the

312
00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:23.260
plane and just like, like,
who is it? Aaron Sorkin,

313
00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:26.350
I think wrote the film
and he's known for his

314
00:17:26.350 --> 00:17:29.410
dialogue. And I, I was,
I was thinking about like

315
00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:32.380
how the dialogue is like
super clever, but the, the

316
00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:34.960
things that, that when he,
when he tries to make

317
00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:38.770
like technical jokes or like
just show some sort of

318
00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:42.340
technical credit in the writing,
it comes across, like with

319
00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:49.500
the same level of sophistication
is, is hackers hackers. Yes.

320
00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:54.990
Which is a fabulous film.
But yeah. And I think

321
00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:59.470
it's interesting that like, people
are aware enough of, of

322
00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:02.040
sort of the buzz words
and like the, the things

323
00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:05.610
that are associated with, with,
with what we do, but

324
00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:09.150
the, they still use those
things to paint a picture

325
00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:12.840
of, of, of this, this,
this nerd, like this, this

326
00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:16.470
sort of like social outcasts,
like the, I remember reading

327
00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:19.560
when, when the social network
came out, that it was,

328
00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:23.130
it was a mischaracterization in
a lot of respects, particularly

329
00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:26.880
one of the things that
I remember was that they'd

330
00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:31.320
mentioned the, the sort of
driving force in, in the

331
00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:33.900
movie is that like, he's
trying to like impress or

332
00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:37.560
anger this girl. And in
reality, he had like a

333
00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:40.080
steady girlfriend throughout the time.
Who's now his wife. I

334
00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:44.340
think. So it just, just
this idea that like, that

335
00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:48.270
like nerds are like romantically
flawed. Like it just was

336
00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:50.630
one of the things that
kind of stuck out. Yeah.

337
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:54.260
I mean, there is a
certain amount of, let me

338
00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:56.180
just to say that he
created the, you know, one

339
00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:58.520
of the most successful companies
and now, you know, a

340
00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:01.640
billion people on the planet
because, you know, he really

341
00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:04.580
wanted to hang out with
this girl. Like he didn't

342
00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:07.330
just want to solve a
technical problem. God forbid he

343
00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:09.530
didn't want, and they never,
they never showed the nerd

344
00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:12.110
as being a competent business
person who had an idea

345
00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:14.720
and executed on that idea.
Right. You know what I

346
00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:17.630
mean? That would be a
really boring social network trailer.

347
00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:20.390
He had an idea he
chose to execute on that

348
00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:23.180
idea. You know? I mean,
no. Yeah. There was a

349
00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:29.660
girl. Oh, alright, here we
go. Great. So then does

350
00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:34.790
that cause people to kind
of opt out? Yeah, that

351
00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:37.910
was, that was, that was
definitely one of the things

352
00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:40.460
that, that I felt like
I could back up. So

353
00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:44.180
there's, there's this deep room
study. I, a woman at

354
00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:46.880
the university of Washington did
where she, where she led

355
00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:50.000
these people into one of
two rooms and asked them

356
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.950
if they wanted to do
computer science. One was like

357
00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:54.830
a very generic kind of
room, very comfortable. The other

358
00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:57.200
was essentially a comfortable room,
but it was covered in

359
00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:00.680
like geek paraphernalia. And she
got, she got a much

360
00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:03.830
better response from people led
into this sort of neutral

361
00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:07.460
room. Then those led into
the geek room just because

362
00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:10.190
people were like, Oh, this
is, this is not me.

363
00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:12.590
Like, this is something very
well, I dunno, I dunno

364
00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:14.750
why they did it or
why they said that. But

365
00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:18.080
the, the results imply that
that people didn't want to

366
00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:23.310
be associated with with that
sort of geekiness or it

367
00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:27.260
made them feel excluded in
some way. Well, I could

368
00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:29.690
definitely see how that would
make someone feel it, people

369
00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:32.060
can feel excluded based on
any number of things. It

370
00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:34.940
can be something that you
can see a color or

371
00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:37.780
gender, or it could be
something that how you, how

372
00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:42.180
you feel. I mean, this
is why a, a in

373
00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:46.010
equal workplace is so important
because if you're calling out

374
00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:48.790
someone because of any aspect
of their personality, they're going

375
00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:52.360
to feel totally excluded in
Latin and unwelcome, but they

376
00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:55.030
may never actually say it.
They may just disappear from

377
00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:57.400
the workplace one day and
you're like, exactly what was

378
00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:59.560
wrong with that guy? Oh,
well, you know, it turns

379
00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:01.570
out we were all eating
bacon and he totally was

380
00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:04.600
not into vacant. Yeah. But
when does it get to

381
00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:06.970
PC though? I mean, someone
who listening might say, I'll

382
00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:10.270
come on. This is another
diversity and technology talk and

383
00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:13.870
you know, who cares? Who,
who has the opportunity or

384
00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:16.030
who shows up ultimately the
work gets done. And if

385
00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:19.690
it's all a bunch of
Anglo-Saxon white guys, why do

386
00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:24.120
we, you know, who cares?
Right. And that's a, that's

387
00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:28.320
an attitude that I think
definitely pervades everything. Even, even

388
00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:31.020
like, it's easier to talk
about almost when you're talking

389
00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:33.210
about things like, like vacant
or like drinking, like you

390
00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:36.330
mentioned, because those are, those
are things that, you know,

391
00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:38.370
we, we can change and
like, we don't, you know,

392
00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:41.280
we don't have to go
around all the time. Like

393
00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:44.220
even if we enjoy bacon
or alcoholic eating bacon or

394
00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:48.450
drinking alcohol, but people still
don't want to be, I

395
00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:52.290
think they, they perceive being
told what they can and

396
00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:54.720
can't have in can can't
do as, as some sort

397
00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:59.010
of threat. And there that's,
I think we just need

398
00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:00.480
to be better about that.
We need to be a

399
00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:03.600
little bit more adult about
being willing to have those

400
00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:07.380
kinds of conversations, because right
now, like you said, like,

401
00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:10.590
I, I think that if
you, if you feel uncomfortable,

402
00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:13.020
like with something that's happening
in your workplace or like

403
00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:16.260
a conference or on IRC
or whatever, like you're really,

404
00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:19.260
your only option is to,
is to leave because you're

405
00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:21.600
not going to get a
good response. If you're like,

406
00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:24.330
Hey, can we, can we
like stop doing this? This

407
00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:27.180
is making me uncomfortable. And
we don't have, we don't

408
00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:29.250
really have a good way
of talking about that without

409
00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:32.010
everybody like flipping out and
being like, you're trampling over

410
00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:36.810
my rights. And it's unfortunate
and kind of silly because

411
00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:42.150
it, yeah, it's just pointless.
I don't know What about

412
00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:44.740
professionalism? This word gets thrown
around a lot and I

413
00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:48.090
get accused of being ageist.
Cause I'm like, I'm, you

414
00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:50.640
know, I'm, I guess I'm
in my late thirties now,

415
00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:54.180
right up against 40. And
a lot of people are

416
00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:56.580
using this kind of get
off my lawn comment around

417
00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:58.830
me a lot. And I'm
just like, yeah, the kids

418
00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:01.050
today. And you, you use
that, you throw that term

419
00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:05.100
out there kind of lightly
the kids today. You know,

420
00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:08.790
the kids today, they don't
not understand professionalism and they

421
00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:14.550
don't understand. And his professionalism
even required. I think we

422
00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:18.240
need some professionalism. I don't
think we necessarily need the

423
00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:21.000
classic picture of professionalism, but
I think we need to

424
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.820
be willing to define professionalism.
And I think that's our

425
00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:26.640
real problem is that we
refuse to define it for,

426
00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:30.180
for our own industry. We
don't have any idea of

427
00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:33.840
professional standards beyond just like
the basics of like showing

428
00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:36.420
up to work and like
definitely you have to check

429
00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:39.480
in your code, but like
how we, how we act

430
00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:42.090
and behave like with each
other, as professionals, I think

431
00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:44.700
is something that we, we
refuse over and over again

432
00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:47.870
to talk. And Python is
a really good example. I

433
00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:51.770
think just the blow up
around, around everything that happened

434
00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:54.890
there and how it was
dealt with and were the

435
00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:59.150
comments inappropriate and all this
stuff like that. To me,

436
00:23:59.150 --> 00:24:02.180
those are questions that professionalism
is it professional to, to

437
00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:04.490
make off color jokes at
a conference. And is it

438
00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:06.770
professional to take a picture
of other attendees that are

439
00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:09.200
at a conference and where
are our standards in those,

440
00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:11.450
those are all interesting questions
that it would be good

441
00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:14.750
for us to resolve, but
that's not what happened. Everybody

442
00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:19.190
freaked out and people got
fired. And I think that's

443
00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:22.160
what our community does over
and over again when presented

444
00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:25.400
with opportunities to clarify what
we expect from one another,

445
00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:29.950
How could we, that was
a, that was a complicated

446
00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:34.810
and multilayered situation. Yes. And,
you know, I think as

447
00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:37.570
they say, as with all
scandals, mistakes were made on

448
00:24:37.570 --> 00:24:41.680
all sides, but I think
your point was whether or

449
00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:45.910
not the off-color comments were
off color or not, and

450
00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:48.670
whether or not the picture
taken was appropriate or not,

451
00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:52.900
frankly, neither of those things
matter because the re the

452
00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:56.890
resulting reaction was so completely
over the top. Right. And

453
00:24:56.890 --> 00:25:01.300
completely disproportionate to the original
problem that it in fact

454
00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:06.250
proves the original point. Right.
Right. I mean, the point

455
00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:12.760
was, did she feel uncomfortable?
Were those jokes inappropriate doesn't

456
00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:17.590
really matter because the resulting
reaction by whoever and not

457
00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:21.940
necessarily people who reflected the
developer community at large, although

458
00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:26.260
geek community was REL reflected
in the people who reacted,

459
00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:31.750
I could totally see how
anyone, no matter what their

460
00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:33.970
gender or color would say,
okay, this is not really

461
00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:35.980
a group of people I
want to hang out with.

462
00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:39.100
I mean, that was, you
know, like we just poked

463
00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:44.590
the poke, the sleeping lion
here. Yeah. Oh, it was

464
00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:48.880
unprofessional. Yes, exactly. And you
used the term a asshole.

465
00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:52.660
We have an asshole problem
in your tongue. There's actually

466
00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:56.260
a really great book. There's
a couple of, I hate

467
00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:58.240
to say asshole so much
because people listen to this

468
00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:01.900
in the car with their
kids, but there's asshole driven

469
00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:05.650
development. Scott, Scott Burkin has
a whole whole post about

470
00:26:05.650 --> 00:26:08.830
that, about where the biggest
jerk makes the decisions. Wow.

471
00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:12.430
Yeah. That's a reason. It's
like a real thing. You

472
00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:14.170
can probably work. The, I
know I may have actually

473
00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:18.400
been that guy and there's
a couple of books on

474
00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:20.980
finding out, like, if, if
you, if you don't know

475
00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:23.470
who the asshole is on
your team, it's probably you.

476
00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:26.950
Yeah. Yeah. There's a great
book called the no asshole

477
00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:31.480
rule about building a civilized
workplace. That sounds like a

478
00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:34.810
good baseline rule. Indeed, indeed.
But you do do, does

479
00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:38.350
this mean that developers are
simply need babysitters? Is this

480
00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:42.520
why managers exist? I think
that, that's why we have

481
00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:44.700
so many, right. I think
that we could, we could

482
00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:48.000
probably deal without as much
supervision as we have right

483
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.570
now, if we were willing
to, to sort of stop

484
00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:54.720
being assholes to each other,
to make that a priority

485
00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:57.630
in our communities. That that
is maybe not an equal

486
00:26:57.630 --> 00:27:00.600
level, but like somewhere close
to, like how much code

487
00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:02.430
do you check in? Are
you writing? Are you writing

488
00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:05.340
comments? Are you writing tests?
Like, are you being an

489
00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:07.740
asshole, should be one of
those things that you check

490
00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:10.860
when you're doing any sort
of professional coding work. I

491
00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:12.600
think if we want to,
if we want to be

492
00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:18.700
able to be like, like,
conversely, I think that that

493
00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:21.570
would, that would provide us
more freedom if we, if

494
00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:25.830
we were, if we were
able to agree on some,

495
00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:27.990
some, some freedom. So we're
going to give up like

496
00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:29.940
the freedom to offend one
another. I think that we

497
00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:32.370
would get more freedom out
of that because we get

498
00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:35.970
less of these distractions and
less as these like Twitter

499
00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:38.730
Wars and everything else. And
then we actually have more

500
00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:40.860
time to focus on what
we're, what we're doing and

501
00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:45.270
we can exchange ideas and
be good professionals and good

502
00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:48.860
developers. How, how do we
find an end point? Is

503
00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:51.930
there, is there an end
to this, I mean, is,

504
00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:54.800
is civilized discourse like we're
having right now the solution,

505
00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:57.110
or is this, we, we
don't, I don't know how

506
00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:58.730
this culture got created and
I don't know how we're

507
00:27:58.730 --> 00:28:02.780
gonna, I think it's, I
think it's, it comes from

508
00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:06.770
expectations. And I think that
when, when, like, like if

509
00:28:06.770 --> 00:28:09.620
you and I like our
people on, like, we go

510
00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:11.330
in and like go to
our teams and like, we

511
00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:14.480
have a certain expectation professionalism.
And instead of, instead of

512
00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:18.380
just leaving, like when, when
things get uncomfortable, we're willing

513
00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:20.210
to like, do the hard
work of being like, Hey,

514
00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:22.370
that's not cool at work.
I wish you would stop

515
00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:24.830
writing your razor scooter up
and down the hallway. Or

516
00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:27.860
I wish she would stop,
you know, drinking in the

517
00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:29.570
middle of the day or
whatever. I wish she would

518
00:28:29.570 --> 00:28:32.690
stop, like using swear words
to talk about our users,

519
00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:36.890
whatever it is. Like just,
just saying those things and

520
00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:40.130
being, being willing to be
accountable for them. And just

521
00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:43.580
having somebody say those things
though, that that might be

522
00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:47.930
uncool or like, you know,
not, not, not super popular

523
00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:53.840
ideas to consider in developer
communities. I think that's where

524
00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:56.390
it starts in. Like the
more people you have seen

525
00:28:56.390 --> 00:28:59.660
those things, then, then it's
sort of like any other

526
00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:01.760
kinds of diversity, then the
people around you who are

527
00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:04.820
maybe scared to say those
things can, can feel like

528
00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:06.920
that's a valid thing to
say and be like, Hey,

529
00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:09.560
I wish you would take
your razor scooter outside and

530
00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:12.020
play with it out there
while you're at work or

531
00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:17.090
whatever the issue happens to
be. And of course this

532
00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:19.220
all depends on the culture
that that can mean that

533
00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:23.540
a company has chosen definitely
to promote, you know, not

534
00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:25.460
to pick on razor scooter
people. But if you've got

535
00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:27.470
a, you know, if you've
got a ping pong and

536
00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:31.010
pool loud rock music at,
in, in the afternoons and

537
00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:34.730
like beer from two o'clock
on kind of company, yeah.

538
00:29:35.030 --> 00:29:37.430
Someone might think that's not
professional. That seems a little

539
00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:43.330
bit dorm room to me.
But ultimately that's the culture

540
00:29:43.330 --> 00:29:46.020
that, that company has kind
of decided. Yeah. Yeah. If

541
00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:48.660
it's coming from the top,
I don't think you can

542
00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:51.240
really do anything, but leave
if you're not comfortable with

543
00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:54.180
that, which is unfortunate. But
if it's coming from the

544
00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:57.690
top, then that's what it
is. Right? Yeah. It's a

545
00:29:57.690 --> 00:29:59.460
tough one though, because I
mean, no one wants to

546
00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:02.310
be the square, you know,
like that's why I was

547
00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:04.080
so uncomfortable when I said,
you know, I'd really rather

548
00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:06.900
not have a lot of
drinking at these developer conferences.

549
00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:10.080
Yeah. I think, I don't
know. I think that there's

550
00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:12.660
sort of a false economy
there because we expect all

551
00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:15.510
this. We expect we've come
to expect a lot of

552
00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:19.260
entertainment from our communities, from
our jobs, from our professional

553
00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:22.860
circles. And like, I see
it. And I think, I

554
00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:24.810
think there are a lot
of people like who, who

555
00:30:24.810 --> 00:30:27.090
are sort of coming around
to this and Def definitely,

556
00:30:27.090 --> 00:30:29.550
it seems more common among
people who are a little

557
00:30:29.550 --> 00:30:36.090
older to me, but it's,
it's, it's, you're, you're being

558
00:30:36.090 --> 00:30:38.820
given these things and being
asked to stay at work,

559
00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:42.000
to enjoy them instead of
having the free time to

560
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.130
go and do the things
you love on your own,

561
00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:46.590
which yes, you might have
to pay for your own

562
00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:49.140
beer. You might have to
pay for your own train

563
00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:51.090
at the pool table. But
on the other hand, you

564
00:30:51.090 --> 00:30:53.160
get to play, play pool
when and where you want,

565
00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:54.630
you get to drink beer
when and where, and with

566
00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:59.910
whom you want. And we
it's a strange trade off.

567
00:30:59.910 --> 00:31:04.020
And I don't know why
we wouldn't want to define

568
00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:06.300
our, what we do at
work a little bit more

569
00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:09.210
narrowly to not include those
things because they might be,

570
00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:12.570
they might be good bonding
exercises in some sense, but

571
00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:18.450
they're there. I dunno. I
feel like they take away

572
00:31:18.450 --> 00:31:23.700
time from our lives outside
of work and make it

573
00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:26.100
a little dorm roommate. Like
you said, you don't want

574
00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:28.080
to bond necessarily with the
people you work with, the

575
00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:30.570
way you would with the
people you, you had to

576
00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:33.840
live with in college. Yeah.
Yeah. It's such a challenge

577
00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:36.840
though, to find the right
balance. It seems to me

578
00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:40.380
like kind of in wrapping
up that the balance is

579
00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:42.570
the word that everyone wants.
Right. Everyone wants to feel

580
00:31:42.570 --> 00:31:44.970
comfortable. Everyone wants to do
good work. Everyone wants to

581
00:31:44.970 --> 00:31:47.730
have fun. You know, I
like fun as much as

582
00:31:47.730 --> 00:31:51.450
the next person, but at
the same time, they want

583
00:31:51.450 --> 00:31:54.060
to do it in a
safe and encouraging environment where

584
00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:57.150
they're not, but they feel
that their work is appreciated,

585
00:31:57.660 --> 00:32:03.780
right. Without necessarily being a
square. Yeah. It's tough. Yeah.

586
00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:07.980
So people can see your
talk on Vimeo and they

587
00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:12.210
can look at your slides
on speaker deck and they

588
00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:14.820
can check you out at
Garren, G a R a

589
00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:18.750
N n.com and see other
parts of your work. Of

590
00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:23.430
course your work is front
end development, and presumably a

591
00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:25.650
lot more interesting to you
then this topic that we've

592
00:32:25.650 --> 00:32:28.470
just spent the last half
an hour talking about. Well,

593
00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:30.450
this is, this is very
interesting as well. I mean,

594
00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:34.450
I've been doing this since
the nineties. And so I'm,

595
00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:38.190
I'm very interested in sort
of what, what that's all

596
00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:40.640
meant to me as a
person. So Yeah, this is

597
00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:43.570
interesting too. Cool. Well, thanks
so much for chatting with

598
00:32:43.570 --> 00:32:48.700
me today. This has been
another episode of Hanselminutes and

599
00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:54.010
we'll see you again next
week. <inaudible>.
