this episode, Scott talks to

7
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.750
the science of fitness with
John Lamb. Hi, this is Scott

8
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.940
Hanselman and this is another
episode of Hansel minutes. And

9
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.820
today I've got a really
smart guy and good friend,

10
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.240
John Lamb from the Microsoft campus.
How's it going, John? I'm

11
00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.790
going to good, Scott, John
you've always got cool stuff.

12
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.460
Every time we talk, we
end up talking for about

13
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.920
two or three hours. I
usually stop by and say,

14
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.290
Hey, how's it going? You
have 10 minutes. And then

15
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.130
we ended up canceling meetings
and stuff. And a little

16
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.740
while ago, I had the
idea that we should talk

17
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.360
about some of the cool
gadgets out there. Cause I

18
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.430
know you've always got good
analysis and good opinions, and

19
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.050
oftentimes they are completely separate
from my opinions. You were

20
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.410
telling me about tracking your
workouts via, via GPS. Yeah,

21
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.260
so I'm, I used to
do a lot of writing

22
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.680
when I was a kid
and of course, you know,

23
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.470
life happens, you know, afterwards,
right? So I had plenty

24
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.900
of time when I was
in graduate school to go

25
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.640
train and do a bunch
of other fun things. And,

26
00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:42.920
and then when, you know,
you're, you know, you get

27
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.960
married and a bunch of
kids show up, you pretty

28
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.000
well have no time at
all to do things until

29
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.710
your kids kind of get
to this kind of magical

30
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.080
age. Right. Which is where
mine are right now. So

31
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.760
actually I have some time
to myself again, and I

32
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.260
can get to go off
and do some fun things.

33
00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.200
And so one of the
things that I recently started

34
00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.020
doing again, was riding my
bike and, you know, and

35
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.940
being kind of like this
kind of data obsessed kind

36
00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.590
of guy, I decided to,
you know, start buying some

37
00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.290
more gadgets right. To, to
help motivate me. Cause in

38
00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:10.970
a lot of ways, it's,
it's being able to do

39
00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.770
the measurement and seeing the
progress and stuff that keeps

40
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.760
me motivated to do this
stuff. So this, this gadget

41
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.610
that I just bought from
my bike recently was the

42
00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.970
garment edge 500. And what
it is is it's a

43
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.070
little, it's a thing called
a it's a head unit.

44
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.420
So it's something that you
kind of clip to your

45
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.880
handlebars on your bike. And
really all it is is

46
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.580
it's a little time series
recorder along with GPS. So

47
00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.250
the time series or quarter
will obviously record your GPS.

48
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.870
This is where I am
at this moment and do

49
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.800
that on, on two second
intervals. But what it also

50
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.400
does is it collects data
from sensors. So there's a

51
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.930
protocol called the ant plus
protocol that was developed by

52
00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.260
a company that Garmin recently
acquired. And the Amplus protocol

53
00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.480
allows a bunch of different
devices, much of these kinds

54
00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.500
of exercise, keep devices to
speak wirelessly to this head

55
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.540
unit, right? So it will
do things like, you know,

56
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.010
what the right and plus
heart rate strap monitoring strap.

57
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.710
It will transmit that signal
off to your, to your,

58
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.580
your bike computer. There's a
little thing that measures how

59
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.070
fast to, you know, you're
peddling, right? Your cadence meter.

60
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.320
So that thing is there,
there's another sensor on the

61
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.300
wheel that will tell you
what your four velocity is,

62
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.940
which is generally more accurate
than relying on GPS to

63
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.030
tell you what your, what
your instantaneous velocity is. So

64
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.610
that gets recorded as well.
So what happens is these

65
00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.350
guys typically take their, their
workouts. They upload them to

66
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.100
some site. The big one
is, is training peaks and,

67
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.380
and your coach will also
have an account on this

68
00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.540
site. So while it's free
for the use of the

69
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.520
coach winds up paying, you
know, fees to use a

70
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.850
training fee on training peaks,
which kind of translates back

71
00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.010
into you paying more money
to the coach, right? So

72
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.440
to get this kind of
value added analysis, and what

73
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.360
they'll do is they'll kind
of look at your, your

74
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.180
data and tell you whether
or not you're on track

75
00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.610
for the goals that you're
setting and to do kind

76
00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.590
of adjustments based on the
data. So you can either

77
00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.360
analyze the data yourself, or
you're gonna hire somebody else

78
00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.670
to analyze the data. And
more importantly, kind of plan

79
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.350
what the next set of
workouts you're going to be

80
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.500
doing are. And so this
is all made possible, you

81
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.520
know, through, through additional data.
There's plenty of guys out

82
00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.390
there Remembering that you have
to talk to me like

83
00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.310
I'm a four year old
here because I probably have

84
00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.000
the cardiovascular system of a
four year old as a

85
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.200
happily sedentary individual. I want
to understand why I would

86
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.270
care this much about this
much data. I mean, I'm

87
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.730
looking at these screens and
I see like a satellite

88
00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.850
route from the sky with
a line showing where the

89
00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:38.730
person ran like average, average
power in Watts, average Watts,

90
00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:43.200
per kilogram, of, of a
physical weight. There's lots of

91
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.510
charts and graphs. Why do
I care this much? I

92
00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.790
mean, I understand why I
would care if I was

93
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.430
compiling code. And this was
like looking at on a

94
00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.790
kind of dependency analysis and
psychometric complexity, but here I'm

95
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:57.540
just seeing color colorful information
that doesn't, it doesn't tell

96
00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.580
me anything. Why do I
care this much? Don't I

97
00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.830
just want to have a
good run. Sure. You want

98
00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.230
to have a good run.
It all depends on where,

99
00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.800
so the, the kind of
analytical personality that I think

100
00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.960
is, you know, a lot
of you see a lot

101
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.480
of people around here at
Microsoft, you know, riding their

102
00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.510
bikes and running and doing
other things. Right. And, and,

103
00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.970
and not surprisingly the same
people that have the inclination.

104
00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.520
I'm not saying that all,
all software developers that people

105
00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.230
like to go running, ride
bikes and stuff, you know,

106
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.080
just kind of look around.
Right. But, but for the

107
00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.320
people that do have that,
the kind of analytical bench

108
00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:32.130
that they have really kind
of drives them towards, Hey,

109
00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.500
I want more information about
what I'm doing and I

110
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.330
want to do it the
right way. Right. So, so

111
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.630
a lot of this stuff
is really about being able

112
00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.280
to train at the right
intensity of the right times

113
00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:42.690
because you can't just go
out there and hammer on

114
00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:45.630
every single workout. Right. Cause
if you do that, you're

115
00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.060
just going to suffer and
you're unlikely to improve anywhere

116
00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.050
near as fast as you
could. If you worked out

117
00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.360
at precisely the right intensity
and in a lot of

118
00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.040
cases is a lot less
intensity than you might expect.

119
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.470
Right. If you're just kind
of this type, a kind

120
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:02.510
of person that just wants
to improve, improve, improve, right.

121
00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.910
More often than an OD,
you're going to overtrain rather

122
00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:08.960
than under-trained. And so being
able to analyze a monitor,

123
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.240
precisely what you're doing and
give you two things, right?

124
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.720
Both the instantaneous feedback when
you're actually doing the activity,

125
00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:19.520
as well as the kind
of posts, activity analysis, you

126
00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.020
know, those are the ways
that you can wind up

127
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.270
making sure that you're doing
the right activities at the

128
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.410
right times. Yeah. How do
we know what this, I

129
00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:28.870
mean, where's the science of
this that tells me that

130
00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.750
it's a good time to
work out versus a patch.

131
00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:35.650
Oh, there's an enormous amount
of literature on, on this

132
00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:37.390
kind of stuff. So depending
on the activity, right. So,

133
00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:40.570
you know, I don't know
our activities, but so there's,

134
00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:43.600
if you kind of look
at things like cycling, there's

135
00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.730
this kind of notion of
periodization that you want to

136
00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:47.410
do, right. So you want
to, you want to start

137
00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:48.940
off at different points of
time and you want to

138
00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:51.100
kind of increase the stress
for some period of time

139
00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.710
and then back off. Right.
So kind of think about

140
00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:56.620
it as this kind of
stepping function, right. Where, you

141
00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:57.670
know, we're going to go
up and we're going to

142
00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:59.170
get down a little bit,
and then we're gonna go

143
00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:00.700
up a little bit more
higher than where you were

144
00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.040
before and then down a
bit. So the notion is

145
00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.850
that your bite by doing
this periodization and, and by

146
00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:09.220
stressing your body and then
giving it a chance to

147
00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:10.960
recover, stressing your body and
giving you a chance to

148
00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.330
recover and doing that on
the right sets of intervals,

149
00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.860
you can peak for some
important event. So give me

150
00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:19.870
a good example of this.
If you look at how

151
00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:23.560
Lance Armstrong dominated the tour
de France, certainly during the

152
00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.180
seven years where he wanted
seven years in a row,

153
00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:28.450
he took a very unusual
approach, unlike like a lot

154
00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:30.880
of other guys, which was,
that was the only race

155
00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.710
he really cared about. He
didn't care about any of

156
00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:34.120
the other races. So he
showed up at a race.

157
00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:36.640
He was using it as
a training thing, or as

158
00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:37.840
a way to kind of
support some of the other

159
00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:39.760
guys on his team that
he would need to support

160
00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.040
him when it came time
for his important race, which

161
00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:45.190
was the tour. And so
his entire season was built

162
00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:48.700
around peaking in, on a,
roughly a two week period

163
00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.670
in the latter half of
July, right. Which is when

164
00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:54.400
you hit the mountains and
in the tour. And that's

165
00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:57.490
primarily responsible for why he
was, he was as successful

166
00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:00.550
as he was. And his
coach, Chris Carmichael is one

167
00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:03.130
of these guys that is
extremely focused on this kind

168
00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:06.190
of data thing, right? So
the magic number for the

169
00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:08.380
tour de France, if you
want to win the tour,

170
00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:11.920
what you need to be
able to generate is 6.7

171
00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:17.110
Watts per kilogram of body
weight for 30 minutes, right?

172
00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:19.390
That's your, your kind of
your CP 30, if you

173
00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:21.700
can generate that much power
for that period of time,

174
00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.730
you're going to win the
tour. And You said for

175
00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:28.300
30 minutes in a purse,
30 minutes. So that's the

176
00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:30.070
average power that you need
to be able to generate

177
00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:31.780
the 30 minutes in order
to win the tour de

178
00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:34.630
France, right? Because that's the
power that you need to

179
00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:36.910
be able to generate on
the steep Hill, right? When

180
00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:39.940
you need your competition right.
Everywhere else, it doesn't really

181
00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:41.560
matter. But that's the part
where you have to generate

182
00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:43.390
your peak power. And that's
where the kilogram thing becomes

183
00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:46.690
important because you know, these
guys are obsessive about their

184
00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:49.090
ways. You know, cyclists are
really kind of crazy obsessed

185
00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:51.400
about weight, right? Because it's
all about, you can imagine

186
00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:54.760
how that affects that ratio
and your ability to hits

187
00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:58.770
6.7 Watts per kilogram. So,
you know, a lot of

188
00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:00.150
these guys and a lot
of the numbers that you

189
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:02.100
do in your testing, right,
is all about seeing whether

190
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:04.140
or not you're getting closer
to the set of goals

191
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:06.990
that you need to accomplish
the things that you want.

192
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:10.140
Right. So when it's where
at 6.7 to be a

193
00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:13.470
nationally ranked rider, it's five
point something. So, you know,

194
00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:15.750
you, you kind of get
to see the number, right?

195
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:19.140
That it takes for you
to be competitive, all sorts

196
00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:20.790
of other things, right. That
are around whether or not

197
00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:22.890
you're actually gonna win, you
know, whether or not you

198
00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:25.050
crash, whether or not you're
healthy, there's a whole bunch

199
00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:27.330
of other factors. Right. But
some of those things are

200
00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:30.000
things you can't really control.
Right. But that's one thing

201
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.170
you can absolutely control. So
I'm looking at this website

202
00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:37.100
by a guy named DC
Rainmaker who does an analysis

203
00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:40.130
of this software called sports
tracks. And I'm looking in

204
00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:42.200
his screenshots and this, you
know, it looks like a

205
00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:45.230
pretty fit guy and he
does triathlons. And basically it's

206
00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:48.110
pretty clear that whether he
has a job or not,

207
00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:50.870
this is what he does.
And he, his job is

208
00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:54.710
secondary to, this is running
physicality aspect of his personal

209
00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:57.590
Blogs. He doesn't really blog
about his job. Right. He

210
00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:00.290
he's a, he's some kind
of computer guy. Right. But,

211
00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:02.030
but he doesn't really say
much more than he's some

212
00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:04.730
kind of computer guy. It's
like, when you meet somebody

213
00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:07.160
and they say, Oh yeah,
I'm an actor. And you

214
00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:09.080
say, Oh, really? You know,
so what restaurant do you

215
00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:12.170
work at? They are an
actor regardless of where they

216
00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:14.180
work. So here's a guy
who is a software guy,

217
00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:16.250
even though he seems to
be pretty hardcore. It says

218
00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:21.020
his average power is three
Watts per kilogram. So that,

219
00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:23.030
that tells me one thing
that this guy is incredibly

220
00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:28.730
hardcore, but still not even
half as, as powerful as

221
00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:31.040
he would need to be
to compete at the door.

222
00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.170
Oh yeah. Yeah. The tour
is a whole other thing

223
00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:35.810
than just being a guy
that, that, that he does

224
00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:37.820
well, by the way. Right.
So, so if you look

225
00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:39.260
at his race results, this
is a guy that does

226
00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.650
well, but, but yeah. You
know, there's, there's a world

227
00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:43.970
of difference between a guy
like him and a guy

228
00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:46.550
like Lance Armstrong. Well, then
it brings up the question

229
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:49.280
of those. What's the difference
between this guy, this average,

230
00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:56.150
you know, this average physical
guy and me, Well, there's

231
00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:58.070
a big difference between him
and you as well. It's

232
00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:02.000
probably bigger than the gap
between him and Lance, right?

233
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.560
Like, you know, if you
don't do this stuff right.

234
00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:07.760
It's, you know, it's a
huge difference. Well, well, you

235
00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:10.550
know, like, like I saw
you re tweeting last night,

236
00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:14.840
the, the, the, the video
right. Of the NFL combine,

237
00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:18.110
right. They had some sports
Casper guy. Right. You know,

238
00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:21.080
try to do the 40
yard dash. Right? Yeah. They

239
00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:23.330
had a random guy in
a suit, which I thought

240
00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:25.250
was kind of a cheesy
thing. And they filmed him

241
00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:27.710
running as fast as he
could for 40 yards. And

242
00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:30.560
then they overlaid all the
other people on the team.

243
00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:33.350
And it was pretty clear
that the other guys were

244
00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:36.050
three, four times faster. Yeah.
I don't know if you

245
00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:37.760
know what the combine is,
but the Columbine is where

246
00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:44.210
we're prospective NFL recruits go
to kind of show off

247
00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:47.330
their, their physical abilities let's
call it. So there's a

248
00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:48.830
whole bunch of different tests.
And one of the tests

249
00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:51.920
that they do is this
40 yard dash. And so

250
00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.280
I think the guy that
the at Jacoby was the

251
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:56.680
fastest guy that combined Jacoby
rented in four to eight,

252
00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:00.160
which is really, really fast.
World-class speed is generally around

253
00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:04.150
four, three world-class sprinters. We'll
do it for three. And

254
00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:06.910
so it's, it's yeah. It's,
it's amazing. So some of

255
00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:08.800
the things that you might
not expect when you look

256
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.780
at, you know, kind of
numbers like that, my brother

257
00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:14.290
works in this area. He's
a high performance trainer in

258
00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:18.010
Toronto. And so one of
the interesting things that they

259
00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:19.870
do at the combine is
see how high guys can

260
00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:22.390
jump, right? And so there's
a whole science around kind

261
00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:24.970
of measuring, you know, and
training and so that you

262
00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:27.100
can peak on your, on
your vertical cause that's, that's

263
00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:30.460
the best predictor of what
your explosive power is, is

264
00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:32.230
how you, how you can
jump. So you see some

265
00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:35.410
of these giant NFL lineman,
right? These 300 2,330 pound

266
00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:38.320
guys, you'd be shocked at
how high these guys can

267
00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:42.430
jump right there. These NFL
lineman guys, right. Can probably

268
00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:46.330
jump, you know, the good
ones can jump 35 inches

269
00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:49.240
now to put that in
perspective, the average vertical in

270
00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:52.420
the NBA is I think
it's somewhere around 25 inches,

271
00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:56.650
right? So there's 330 pound
guy can jump higher than

272
00:12:56.650 --> 00:13:00.100
the average NBA basketball player.
And which is like, again,

273
00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.890
night and day above like
normal, regular people that don't

274
00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:05.740
train for those kinds of
stuff. So it's really interesting

275
00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:08.230
to kind of look at
the, the kind of science

276
00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:10.110
and the sport that, you
know, that goes into training

277
00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:12.100
and for this kind of
stuff. And a lot of

278
00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:14.230
just kind of driven by
data. So the vertical thing

279
00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:16.030
is actually most people do
this just by jumping on

280
00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:17.380
timing, how long it takes
for you to hit the

281
00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:20.700
ground again, Right now, interestingly,
a lot of these people

282
00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:24.720
are focusing their, their training
and their coaches are focusing

283
00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:27.120
their training on, like you
said, achieving a particular goal,

284
00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:31.320
a winning a particular game,
or maximizing their abilities during

285
00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:37.320
their, during their reasonable amount
of usefulness. Right? I mean,

286
00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:40.380
an NFL guy, isn't you
understands he's only going to

287
00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:43.470
play the game for so
long. I wonder if anyone

288
00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:48.360
does analysis to maximize one's
life and health. Cause it

289
00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:50.460
seems like it's always the
basketball players and the football

290
00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:53.340
players that are blowing their
knees out or collapsing, which

291
00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:56.250
makes me think that maybe
they're operating at peak intensity

292
00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:59.250
for too long. And I
wonder if, if one could

293
00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:03.330
do, if, if a coach
could be managing your peak

294
00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:06.630
output such that you're not
trying to win races, but

295
00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:09.060
you're just trying to live
a really long time. Sure.

296
00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:10.710
So if you look at
some of the other things

297
00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:12.660
that people have kind of
created, if you go to

298
00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:18.090
a site called fitbit.com or
you've seen Fitbit before it

299
00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:22.680
does fit, yeah. They sold
this little church gum for

300
00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:26.370
a hundred bucks and you
clip it to yourself. And

301
00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:28.410
what the thing is is
it's got a little accelerometer

302
00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:31.260
in it and, and the,
the ability to record time

303
00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.930
series data again, right? And
it's also got a transmitter

304
00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:37.020
so that when you walk
by this, this little sensor

305
00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:40.050
connected to your PC, it
will automatically sync with your

306
00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:42.600
PC and upload the data
up to the Fitbit website.

307
00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:44.820
And the idea here is
what it's going to track

308
00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:48.930
is how many it's going
to be, obviously right? Since

309
00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:50.550
it's an accelerometer, it knows
when you're sitting on your

310
00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:52.850
butt in front of computer,
it knows when you're walking

311
00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:55.670
around and knows when you're
running, if you sleep with

312
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:58.400
this thing as well, right?
With this little strap, it

313
00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.470
will also tell you how
many hours of quality sleep

314
00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:02.570
that you've gotten tonight. And
it will tell you how

315
00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:04.850
long it took you to
fall asleep. How long, how

316
00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:06.080
many times you woke up
in the middle of the

317
00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:08.150
night and a bunch of
other things like that. So

318
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:10.700
there, this is probably the
most interesting device in the

319
00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:12.620
sense that it records, what
you're doing when you're asleep.

320
00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:16.400
And what that is great
for is if you're back

321
00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:19.520
to this kind of, I'm
obsessed about numbers and hitting

322
00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:23.030
my numbers kind of person,
it helps because this is

323
00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:24.230
one of the few things
that's gonna force you to

324
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:26.810
sleep more because you get
to see it, right? There's

325
00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:28.940
this old saying that says,
you know what, Lord Kelvin

326
00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:32.100
said this, right? Which says,
you know, you, can't what

327
00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:37.850
you can't measure. You can't
improve. And so, so back

328
00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:39.290
to the kind of quality
of your life and your

329
00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:41.720
kind of sleep patterns is
a really big part of

330
00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:43.910
that thing. If you don't
actually measure and write that

331
00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:47.650
down, you don't know. Okay.
Cause this is interesting because

332
00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:50.260
this resonates with me more
than the charts and graphs.

333
00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:54.370
Sure. But this is a
really kind of unobtrusive device.

334
00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:58.780
Hi, this is Scott Hanselman
from another parallel universe. Gotta

335
00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:00.460
tell you about some of
our things our sponsors are

336
00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:04.480
doing. They make this free
podcast possible. If you're developing

337
00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:06.910
a new line of business
application, you've probably tried the

338
00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:09.280
latest version of server line.
Now you can get even

339
00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:12.070
better results by combining the
functionality and server Lite for

340
00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:14.410
beta, with some of the
richness or the third party

341
00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:17.860
controls from our friends at
Tellerik, they're the first vendors

342
00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:20.200
to offer native support for
the server Lite for beta

343
00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:22.570
and their rad controls. They've
got a new server Lite

344
00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:25.600
for CTP suite of these
controls. They let you tap

345
00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:28.090
into the frameworks, great potential.
You've got native, right mouse

346
00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:30.400
click and all the new
features of server line. There's

347
00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:33.850
38 controls that give you
all these features. You can

348
00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:36.520
start building those compelling line
of business applications right away.

349
00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:41.110
I encourage you to check
those products out at tellerik.com/silverlight

350
00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:44.620
and you know, thank Tellerik
for supporting Don and rock

351
00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:48.670
supporting Hansel minutes on their
Facebook fan page at facebook.com/tellerik.

352
00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:52.600
Now back to the show,
I did a thing recently

353
00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:55.390
with called a Z O
Z O if you want,

354
00:16:55.390 --> 00:17:00.100
are you familiar with this
device? Zeo is asleep. I

355
00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:04.870
think it's my xeo.com Z
O. And it's a focus

356
00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:07.180
entirely on sleep. So it's
not like the Fitbit in

357
00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:10.630
that it's focused on, you
know, just general movement and

358
00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:12.700
fitness, but it's a, they
call it a personal sleep

359
00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:16.300
coach. It's at my ceo.com
and it looks, it looks

360
00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:20.260
like a clock radio. And
rather than using an accelerometer,

361
00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:23.170
it's actually, you know, I
don't know, zapping something into

362
00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:25.420
your brain and getting a
general sense of whether your

363
00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:30.100
brain's on or not. And
it basically, it has four

364
00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:33.370
levels that it can measure.
Are you awake? Are you

365
00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:35.650
in Ram? Are you in
light sleep? Or you can

366
00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:38.230
completely conked out in, in
deep sleep. And then it

367
00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:41.320
comes up with a number
they call your ZQ from

368
00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:43.360
zero to a hundred or
zero to something like some

369
00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:45.520
kind of an index, right?
It gives you a sense

370
00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:47.470
of how you're doing. And
basically they take all that

371
00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:48.880
data and give you a
nice chart and a graph

372
00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:51.750
if care. But ultimately they
say, yeah, last night you

373
00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:54.570
slept a 73 and then
you can go and say,

374
00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:57.450
Oh God, why did I
sleep at 73? Oh gosh,

375
00:17:57.810 --> 00:18:00.450
I bet you that if
I closed the window, I

376
00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:02.010
would sleep. And then you
get to look at that

377
00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:04.710
number. And it was really,
really useful. The problem was

378
00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:07.320
it was $300. It was
brilliant. I mean, everyone, I

379
00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:10.020
had a bunch of people
went and did trials with

380
00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:11.940
it. There's a free 30
day trial. It's really popular.

381
00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:16.050
Everyone loves it, but what's
this, have you used this

382
00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.900
yourself? Oh yeah, I did
the full 30 day trial.

383
00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:21.800
And you returned it at
the end. I return it

384
00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:24.900
at the end because for
two reasons, one's, it's $300

385
00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:29.910
and two, I sleep awesome.
I sleep like dead. So

386
00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:32.280
I don't need a machine
to tell me that. What

387
00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:34.560
did the machine tell you
that you slept awesome? Yes.

388
00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:37.050
And the machine confirmed that
I slept awesome. Like I

389
00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:39.060
slept so awesome that the
machine didn't have anything to

390
00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:42.240
do to tell me that
I could sleep better. And

391
00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:44.550
one thing though, that was
creepy though, from a biofeedback

392
00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:47.250
perspective, was that it did
tell me what I already

393
00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:49.320
knew and it confirmed it
very clearly. Like I knew

394
00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:51.210
when I was up and
I knew like there was

395
00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:54.420
one night where I had
some just crazy dreams. So

396
00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:56.400
then I said, Oh, this
is a good opportunity to

397
00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:58.410
check, to see if it
noticed that. And it did,

398
00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:01.740
it knew that I was
completely whacked out while sleeping.

399
00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:05.490
And the time that I
thought I was it registered

400
00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:09.770
on their chart, Things like
that. Right. Like, so I

401
00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:12.020
think some of the interesting
things about these devices is

402
00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:14.660
the kind of connecting to
your social graph thing. So

403
00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:16.700
here's, here's another example, right
back to this aunt plus

404
00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:18.800
wireless protocol we were talking
about with the garment thing,

405
00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:24.320
they now have a plus
scales and a so, and

406
00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:27.200
there's also scales that also
do things like connect to

407
00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:29.240
the internet via wifi and
stuff like that. Right. So

408
00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:31.310
this is kind of part
of the, one of the

409
00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:34.010
best ways of trying to
achieve your goals is to

410
00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:38.390
kind of engage in public
humiliation and shaming. So, so

411
00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:39.770
one of the great things
is, you know, you go

412
00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:41.960
up and you stand on
the scale, right. You know,

413
00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:44.210
each day, or however, often
you want to measure yourself

414
00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:46.040
and it's going to go
off and tweet that, right?

415
00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:47.960
So there's scales out there
that actually do this kind

416
00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:51.620
of stuff. And I think
that, you know, there, there

417
00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:54.710
is something to this, right?
Where if you belong to

418
00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:57.140
the community of people that,
that cares about some set

419
00:19:57.140 --> 00:19:59.480
of goals, right? You know,
this, this kind of personal

420
00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:01.580
humiliation shaming thing, it's actually
a really good way of,

421
00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:05.210
you know, kind of reinforcing
the behavior that you want

422
00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:09.320
out of yourself. That's really
interesting. I, as a, as

423
00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:12.080
a diabetic myself being a
type, a type one diabetic,

424
00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:14.630
I am obsessed with, with
one kind of data, which

425
00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:17.300
is my, which is my
blood sugar. And I have

426
00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:21.710
a continuous meter. That's actually
implanted into my abdomen. I

427
00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:23.510
have to move it once
a week. It's basically, it

428
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:25.760
takes about a, a one
inch needle. You shove the

429
00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:28.220
needle in to your abdomen,
pull the needle out. And

430
00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:30.830
then it leaves a big
long sensor in, and it

431
00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:35.330
looks at the interstitial fluids
and then measures the resistance

432
00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:38.840
that, that interstitial fluid provides
the little battery. And then

433
00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:41.420
the more resistance you have,
the more blood sugar you

434
00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:44.030
have in your, in your
fluids and then the higher

435
00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:46.070
your sugar is. And then
it does some correlations and

436
00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:49.150
some magic. And then wirelessly
tells me, plus, or minus

437
00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:51.850
20% what it thinks my
blood sugar is. And I

438
00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:53.590
always thought, it'd be interesting
to figure out a way

439
00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:56.140
to hook that up to
my blog, such that I

440
00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:59.470
can dynamically update my blood
sugar and thereby publicly shaming

441
00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:04.200
myself into not having that
cookie. Right. I think about

442
00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:05.880
does nothing record the time
series so you can do

443
00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:09.810
the upload later. Oh, absolutely.
It has a Twyla has

444
00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:13.170
24 hours of data. Okay.
So you'd put, the problem

445
00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:15.420
is it's probably inconvenient. You've
got to take it out

446
00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:17.940
and plug it into something
and run some crazy crappy

447
00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:20.430
piece of software. And that's
the thing, the idea that

448
00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:22.890
I could just simply walk
by, it would be cool.

449
00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:24.600
I mean, I don't want
to have to think about

450
00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:28.110
it. The older versions did
USB the newer versions too.

451
00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:31.020
Some kind of Bluetooth derivative,
but none of it's automatic.

452
00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:34.260
Right. See, that's where the
Fitbit guys really nailed the

453
00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:36.390
experience. Right. Cause they know,
Hey, you're probably going to

454
00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:38.460
walk up to your computer
sometime during the day. Right.

455
00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:41.310
Considering the audience and you
know, so when you do

456
00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:47.010
that yeah. Magic, this stuff
just gets uploaded. Yeah. How

457
00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:48.780
long does the battery last?
I don't know. I still

458
00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:50.400
haven't gotten one of these
things yet because they'd been

459
00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:52.590
back-ordered forever. I think there's
still order for the other

460
00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:55.800
month. They're shipping at the
end of April right now.

461
00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:58.860
Yeah. You know, they've got
the price right though. 100

462
00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:00.420
bucks. It's just about the
amount of money that I

463
00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:02.370
would want to spend on
something like this. But the

464
00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:05.010
fact that it does the
sleep, as well as physicality,

465
00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:07.380
I think is kind of
a good idea. And then

466
00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:10.140
what's this about 10,000 steps.
Doesn't that seem to be

467
00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:12.520
the number that everyone talks
about for sedentary people. What

468
00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:16.770
does 10,000 steps, You know,
like it's just some arbitrary

469
00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:19.890
number, right. Which, which is
what you need in order

470
00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:26.310
to get enough motion during
the day that you're going

471
00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:29.880
to hopefully climb out of
that sedentary bucket that you

472
00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:32.550
would otherwise be sitting on.
I don't know much about

473
00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:34.140
that. Cause I don't really
care about the 10,000 steps

474
00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:37.530
thing myself, but Right. You
care about GPS tracking of

475
00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:39.960
every move I care about,
you know, how fast I

476
00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:42.630
can go on my bike.
Yeah. Have you now, have

477
00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:44.820
you ever had a sedentary
point in your life or

478
00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:46.740
have you been fit the
whole time? Oh, hell yeah.

479
00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:49.140
No, I haven't been fit
my whole life. That's life

480
00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:51.360
got really bad for me
back in the nineties. Right.

481
00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:53.850
When I traveled a lot.
Right. So when you travel

482
00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:57.540
a lot, as you well
know now is, you know,

483
00:22:57.540 --> 00:22:59.400
you're eating out all the
time. Right. So, you know,

484
00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:01.440
it sounds kind of glamorous
and all that stuff, but

485
00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:03.330
the reality is a lot
of times you eat crap.

486
00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:07.580
Other times you're eating, you
know, at some restaurant things.

487
00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:10.710
So you'll eat, not necessarily
crap, but expensive crap. Right.

488
00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:14.490
And you know, that combined
with just kind of sitting

489
00:23:14.490 --> 00:23:16.620
around all day long, it
doesn't really do good things

490
00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:18.450
for you. Cause I remember
at one point I think

491
00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:21.060
I peaked out at, at
traveling 26 weeks a year

492
00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:25.260
and that was also correlated
very nicely with weight gain.

493
00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:28.560
Right. So, but now I
think, you know, I've just

494
00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:30.270
kinda got to this point
in my life now where,

495
00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:32.400
you know, a couple of
nice things is, you know,

496
00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:34.470
I, I now live in
a very hilly area, so

497
00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:36.900
it's, you know, you're either
going uphill or downhill around

498
00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:41.160
here. Right. There's no flat
in Redmond and you know,

499
00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:43.890
so that's, that's been great.
That's been great because you

500
00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:46.340
know, just riding my bike,
it's a, it's a great

501
00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:48.890
way of very quickly getting
yourself back into shape at

502
00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:51.080
the same time, because you
have no, no choice, but

503
00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:55.090
to climb Hills around here,
How did you get out

504
00:23:55.090 --> 00:23:58.180
of being, being sedentary? I
mean maybe, maybe I'm just

505
00:23:58.180 --> 00:24:00.760
cynical, but whenever I ask
people, how do you get,

506
00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:03.340
how do you get on
sedentary? They just say, start

507
00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:05.890
moving, just start moving. Just
walk, walk. Well, you start

508
00:24:05.890 --> 00:24:07.960
moving. Right. But you need
to do the right sets

509
00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:11.380
of activities to kind of
reinforce the behavior that you

510
00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:14.410
want. Right. So, so, so
for me, I can't speak

511
00:24:14.410 --> 00:24:16.750
to all people. Right. But
for me, a big thing

512
00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:19.570
is being able to look
at the freaking numbers. Right.

513
00:24:20.650 --> 00:24:23.410
That's interesting to me. So,
so by being able to

514
00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:24.940
go off and ride my
bike, the first thing I

515
00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:26.590
do when I get into
work is pull my bike,

516
00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:29.320
computer off, plug it into
my machine and upload my

517
00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:31.030
data. It's like, Oh yeah.
Okay. Now I see what,

518
00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:32.790
not that, I didn't know
what I did. I, I

519
00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:34.900
did. Right. But it's, I
can compare it against what

520
00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:36.910
I did in different days
and other things, right. It's

521
00:24:36.910 --> 00:24:39.280
back to this because you're
measuring it because there's this

522
00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:41.710
act of writing it down,
even though there's no physical

523
00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:46.270
writing involved here, it, it
really makes things better. So

524
00:24:46.270 --> 00:24:49.480
back to, I remember when
I was a kid and,

525
00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:52.030
and I rode my bike
a lot, I used to

526
00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:55.090
carry a, used to have
a training diary and I

527
00:24:55.090 --> 00:24:56.410
wish I could find that
thing again. Right. Cause that

528
00:24:56.410 --> 00:24:59.050
was an incredibly motivational thing
for me, was being able

529
00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:01.780
to, after I come back
and write down what happened

530
00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:05.800
on that ride. And so
for a lot of that

531
00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:08.440
stuff, it's I find that
the measuring thing is a

532
00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:10.570
huge part of it because
you can see the improvement

533
00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:14.350
and once you can start
seeing the improvement, it becomes

534
00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:17.500
harder to kind of not
do something a given day.

535
00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:19.150
Right. Because I was saying,
Oh, but I like seeing

536
00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:21.430
that, that number. Right. And
that's something that you're not

537
00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:24.640
going to have. I wonder
if this, this Fitbit might

538
00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:26.860
be a good, a good
start. I think about there's

539
00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:29.380
the looking at your basic
chart of like where you

540
00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:32.590
sedentary today, how many hours
were you sedentary and then

541
00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:35.860
the number of hours of
activity. But, but when you

542
00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:38.140
say you're looking at the
numbers to just see improvement,

543
00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:41.020
are you, are you thinking
about how long, how far

544
00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:43.210
you went or how long
you were, you were physically

545
00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:45.670
active and you say, Oh,
look, this week I can

546
00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:48.340
run 15 more minutes than
I could before. Like what

547
00:25:48.670 --> 00:25:51.670
what's improvement. It could be
any number of things like

548
00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:53.890
that. It really kind of
boils down to the goals

549
00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:56.140
that you set for yourself.
And that's when a lot

550
00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:58.090
of cases, it was really
good to actually have somebody

551
00:25:58.090 --> 00:26:00.640
else help you set those
goals. Right. So depending on

552
00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:05.350
how, how much disposable income,
cause that's, that's an expensive

553
00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:06.790
thing all of a sudden,
right? Cause you're now paying

554
00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:09.130
for somebody, else's time to
help you set your goals.

555
00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:11.560
And there's various pieces of
software out there that will

556
00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:13.270
also try and do this.
Right. So rather than the

557
00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:15.850
ongoing costs, you pay the
onetime cost for the software

558
00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:20.020
instead, you know, once you
kind of have your goal

559
00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:22.570
set. Yeah. Then it could
be something as simple as

560
00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:26.050
I want to increase my
weekly mileage by 10% over

561
00:26:26.050 --> 00:26:29.500
this period of time as
I'm building my base. So

562
00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:32.710
that's one way that you
can measure your progress and

563
00:26:32.770 --> 00:26:36.160
because you are measuring it,
you know, you will see

564
00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:38.380
the times when you are
slacking off or you're not

565
00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:40.060
doing things right. You know,
you're not gonna achieve your

566
00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:42.610
goals. And, and I think
again, right, that's the course

567
00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:45.210
correction that you get by
having that kind of continuous

568
00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:48.330
feedback, big believer in continuous
feedback. I think that, yeah.

569
00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:50.060
You know, if you kind
of look at where we're

570
00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:52.430
going with these kinds of
sensors, right? Like, so we're

571
00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:54.200
in this kind of weird
place where if there's lots

572
00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:56.600
of these companies coming up
with these arbitrary little pieces

573
00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:59.870
of technology, almost none of
which actually talk well with

574
00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:02.630
each other, like that I've
got hopes for this Amplus

575
00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:05.780
protocol. Right. Because more and
more right. There's, there's actually

576
00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:09.290
scales now that, that, that,
that speak the N plus

577
00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:11.330
protocol. Right? So for example,
if you weigh yourself in

578
00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:14.330
the morning that Garmin bicycle
computer, if it's on at

579
00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:17.030
that time, right. We'll receive
your weight wirelessly. Right. That

580
00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:18.800
kind of stuff. So you
don't have to go in

581
00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:20.540
and punch some number in,
right. So it's all about

582
00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:22.670
removing the friction points and
trying to get the data

583
00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:26.510
around. And I think that
over time, you know, by

584
00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:29.330
having that data and having
that data available at the

585
00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:32.510
right time to the right
people, you can potentially have

586
00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:37.310
much more wide ranging changes
in people's behavior. So I'll

587
00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:41.550
give you another example of
this. So my wife's a

588
00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:47.150
grandfather in the last year
of his life had a

589
00:27:47.150 --> 00:27:50.090
pacemaker, one of these, no,
sorry. It wasn't a pacemaker.

590
00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:55.100
It was a defibrillator implanted
on his heart. And so

591
00:27:55.130 --> 00:27:56.540
what was interesting is when
he went in for his

592
00:27:56.540 --> 00:28:00.440
checkup, right. Every three months
or so, they would kind

593
00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:02.630
of wave this wand over
him and they would go,

594
00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:05.600
Oh yeah. This thing actually
went off this time and

595
00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:07.910
this time. Right. So this
thing actually kept them alive.

596
00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:09.890
Right. His heart had actually
stopped and this thing has

597
00:28:10.370 --> 00:28:14.060
gone off and he didn't
even know. So what's interesting

598
00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:16.280
is, is, okay. So for
an old guy like him,

599
00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:20.240
that was something that kept
him alive. Right. But if

600
00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:23.690
you consider that somewhere in
the future, right, you might,

601
00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:25.780
you might just implant. One
of these things is this

602
00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:29.240
is a good thing to
do. And once you have

603
00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:31.190
one of these things implanted
and assuming that you've got

604
00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:34.580
an interesting sensor network connected
to your body, now you

605
00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:37.100
have this ability for your
doctor to be able to

606
00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:39.290
go off and look at
your time series data of

607
00:28:39.290 --> 00:28:42.380
what your heart rate was
like since you've last visited

608
00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:45.920
the doctor once time or
not just having the doctor,

609
00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:47.480
being able to see that
stuff, but also for you

610
00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:49.190
to be able to see
that same data so that

611
00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:51.800
you can do those kinds
of self-correction of your activities,

612
00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:53.390
right. It's kind of like
wearing a heart rate monitor

613
00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:55.520
all the time. Right. You
know, if you have the

614
00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:58.280
defibrillator in there, you know,
it's essentially the same thing

615
00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:00.740
as having a heart rate
monitor implanted inside of your

616
00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:03.740
body. I'm really hopeful that
the more kinds of sensors

617
00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:08.750
a weekend, we're also gonna
have this ability to have

618
00:29:09.050 --> 00:29:12.320
a device take that data
from your body and uploaded

619
00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:14.140
into the cloud. Let's call
it right. You know, you

620
00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:16.280
know, somewhere on the internet.
So you can do this

621
00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:20.060
analysis later. So, and now
imagine that you've got all

622
00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:23.000
of this data up in
the cloud. I think there's,

623
00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.940
there's some really interesting opportunities
for, for us to do

624
00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:30.620
much more interesting studies of
people's behavior, right. To hopefully

625
00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:32.990
come up with ways to
try and correct. Some of

626
00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:34.520
the problems we have is
certainly we've we know all

627
00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:37.970
about the obesity epidemic in
the United States and you know,

628
00:29:37.970 --> 00:29:39.680
what are the kinds of
things that might actually work

629
00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:41.730
as motivators? Cause now you
actually have data, right? Because

630
00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:43.870
before you didn't have any
data about this stuff, I'm

631
00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:45.520
only knows. Yeah. People sit
around, watch TV all the

632
00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:48.880
time. Right. But, but now
you potentially have an opportunity

633
00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:52.360
right. To, to try things
and get instant feedback. And

634
00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:54.820
it's all about closing that
feedback loop. So it's not

635
00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:56.890
just about having feedback for
you individually, but it's also

636
00:29:56.890 --> 00:29:59.980
potentially having large clusters of
people to get those kinds

637
00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:03.280
of feedback back on, let's
say a societal level as

638
00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:06.190
well. That's where I really
see the kind of technology

639
00:30:06.190 --> 00:30:09.540
trends going in this area.
It's interesting from a, from

640
00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:13.650
a thinking about it in
the context of privacy, like

641
00:30:13.650 --> 00:30:15.780
I wish that we could
tell all of these different

642
00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:19.860
accelerometer enabled phones that people
have in their back pocket

643
00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:25.530
to suddenly start acting like
they are a Fitbit. But

644
00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:27.450
of course everyone has to
opt into that. But I

645
00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:30.480
wonder if we'll get to
a point where it'll just

646
00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:33.360
be in your pocket and,
and maybe, maybe you'll have

647
00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:35.130
to see this is the
thing. Every time you think

648
00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:37.980
every time you try to
think revolutionary, it starts sounding

649
00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:41.250
like 1984 and you're spying
on everyone. It's like, well,

650
00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:43.890
you know, maybe if you
want to have a really

651
00:30:43.890 --> 00:30:47.190
good health insurance, then you
have to turn on your

652
00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:49.650
phone and it'll tell us
whether or not you're a

653
00:30:49.650 --> 00:30:52.350
fat ass or not. Yeah.
Those privacy things are really

654
00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:53.880
scary, right? Like you take
a look at another little

655
00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:56.070
gadget that the Nike has
come up with, right? The,

656
00:30:56.180 --> 00:31:00.450
the Nike plus stuff where
you, you essentially insert, it's

657
00:31:00.450 --> 00:31:03.960
not an accelerometer, it's actually
a switch that you put

658
00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:05.640
in your shoe. Right. So
when you step on it,

659
00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:07.350
the switch goes off. And
when you, when you step

660
00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:09.630
off of it, right, the
switch, it turns on and

661
00:31:09.630 --> 00:31:13.850
turns off. And, and so
there's a little computer probably

662
00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:17.250
load computer, but it is,
it's a little computer inside

663
00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:18.540
of this little pod that
you put in your shoe.

664
00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:20.790
And what it does is
it measures the time between

665
00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:22.710
the switches going on and
off, right. Based on that,

666
00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:26.550
it can determine how fast
you're going. Right. So lots

667
00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:28.350
of people have that, you
know, the Nike plus shoes

668
00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:31.470
actually have a little kind
of insert. Those kind of

669
00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:33.000
carved out section of the
shoe that you can plug.

670
00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.270
One of these things into.
And people actually around here

671
00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:38.220
at university of Washington have
gone off and use that

672
00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:40.440
to invade people's private privacy.
Right. Cause they have a

673
00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:42.840
little sensor that can also
listen in on the signal.

674
00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:44.310
Right. That's being admitted by
the sink. Cause it's a

675
00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:47.100
wireless transmission to some kind
of unit. It could be

676
00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:49.560
your iPod or it could
be, you know, a phone,

677
00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:53.430
a little watch that you
get from Nike. So people

678
00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:55.500
listen in on this. And
so they actually identify individuals

679
00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:56.640
when they go by. Right.
Cause each one of these

680
00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:59.310
things has a unique ID.
Right. And so they can

681
00:31:59.310 --> 00:32:01.050
kind of track where people
are going and stuff right.

682
00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:02.580
Over some limited range. Right.
Cause you'd have to have

683
00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:05.880
these sensors everywhere, right. To
track where everybody goes, but

684
00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:07.530
it's things like that. Right.
But the reality is if

685
00:32:07.530 --> 00:32:10.770
you carry a cell phone,
right. Somebody somewhere knows where

686
00:32:10.770 --> 00:32:14.290
you are. If they intended
to, if they wanted to

687
00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:17.340
know yeah. Yes. The data
is there. Right. They might

688
00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:19.230
not be looking all the
time, but who knows? Right.

689
00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:23.400
Interesting. Well, you've given me
a lot to think about

690
00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:25.620
John. I really appreciate you
sitting down today and talking

691
00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:29.370
to me about technology and
fitness. Sure. Yeah, no worries.

692
00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:33.030
This has been another episode
of Hansel minutes and we'll

693
00:32:33.030 --> 00:32:34.290
talk to you again next
week.
