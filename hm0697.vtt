G U n.com. Hi, this

11
00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.680
is Scott Hanselman. This is
another. So the Hansel minutes,

12
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.920
and today I'm talking with
dr. Nneka Simmons she's professor

13
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.520
at San Jose state university
does work in teamwork and

14
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.880
leadership and organizational behavior. How
are you? I'm doing well.

15
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.600
Good morning. Yeah. Thanks for
chatting with me today. You

16
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.590
did a very well received
talk at a conference called

17
00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.350
the lead dev conference. This
is this a conference for

18
00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.160
lead developers. Absolutely. Yes. And
you did this in, in

19
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.510
conjunction with your husband who
is in tech, and I've

20
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.000
actually had an one on
the show years ago. So

21
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.250
it's kind of fun to
have, have the other side

22
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.910
of the, the team here.
And Antwan was telling me

23
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.390
earlier that you all are
in what we jokingly call

24
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.480
a mixed marriage. My wife
and I are in a

25
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.540
mixed marriage, but when we
say mixed, we mean geeks

26
00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.870
and tech people and normal
people. Are you the geek

27
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.270
or are you the normal
person? I think I'm the

28
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.780
normal person, but yeah, I'm,
I'm an, I'm an academic

29
00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.690
and we do have some
overlaps with everyone. Definitely loves

30
00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.070
technology at a whole different
level. So he probably reboots

31
00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.390
the router. That's basically his
job in the house. So

32
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.840
what is your PhD in,
you know what? I have

33
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.570
a PhD in management from
Texas a and M in

34
00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.990
college station. I am an
Aggie and I studied organizational

35
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.190
behavior specifically. Interesting. So it's,
so it's so fun for

36
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.540
me as a techie. When
I think of the, I

37
00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.370
call them the hard skills
and we shouldn't say hard

38
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.790
skills or soft skills, but
things code compiles and it

39
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.410
either errors or it doesn't.
And that's very, very measurable

40
00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.850
to me. And when I
think about academics and management

41
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.240
and leadership, it feels soft
in the sense of humans

42
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.840
are complicated and squishy, but
there's real data behind human

43
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.660
behavior. Isn't there. Absolutely. I
mean, yeah. And in some

44
00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.540
ways people consider this, the
things that we study in

45
00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.580
organizational behavior, organizational psychology are
concepts that are abstract, but

46
00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.680
absolutely you can have, we
do studies, qualitative studies, quantitative

47
00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.820
studies, and we look for
statistical significance that can definitely

48
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.000
and show patterns And correlations
in human behavior. Okay. So

49
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.270
this means that this isn't
just opinion, this isn't a

50
00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.110
bunch of people in academia
up on a, a ivory

51
00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.980
tower saying Pretty much. Oh
no, no, absolutely no. There's

52
00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.400
there's data to support these
concepts and these theories that

53
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.150
we're investigating for sure. And
the talk that you all

54
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.190
did was called managing the
burnout burn down. Now I

55
00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.070
know about burndown charts. I
know that I can set

56
00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.140
up a schedule and I
can set up a project

57
00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.900
and burn it, you know,
burn down to eight to

58
00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.260
a moment. What do you,
how do you applying burnout

59
00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.390
to burn down? Yeah, that's
a really good question. So

60
00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.460
basically, as you said, I'm
in a mixed marriage. And

61
00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.740
so when I want to,
now we're talking about burnout

62
00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.560
and how we struggle to
not get to that place.

63
00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.280
He started explaining to me
about the burndown chart, like

64
00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.980
you just said. And basically
we, as, as we discussed

65
00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.960
it, we realized, Oh my
goodness, this really could be

66
00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.490
used as a framework for
this type of a phenomenon

67
00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.950
that people are experiencing and
we can use it to

68
00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.850
kind of help explain some
things that are very apparent

69
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.910
in our culture today. Okay.
So what does that, what

70
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.100
does that framework, how do
you think about tech burnout?

71
00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.930
Well, basically what happens is
we have these charts and

72
00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.870
I know everyone always talks
about there's this optimal line

73
00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.640
in this chart now, and
I may not be using

74
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.970
the proper term, but he
wants to always stay below

75
00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.160
that so he can make
sure that he's on schedule

76
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.310
he's on time, he's all
budget. And what happens is

77
00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.780
with burnout is that people
focus on that and it

78
00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.250
becomes overwhelming. And it's something
that begins to seep into

79
00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.430
your life. And then it
can overtake you and have

80
00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.760
a lot of negative consequences.
Yeah. When I think about

81
00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.370
burn down charts in the
context of a project, I

82
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.070
think about landing an airplane.
But when I think about

83
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.140
burnout and I think about
it in the context of

84
00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.240
a burn down chart, I
think about maybe crashing the

85
00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.260
airplane if I don't maintain
altitude. Right. Absolutely. And what

86
00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.440
happens is, you know, human
beings, I mean, you're your

87
00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.120
biggest asset is your, your
health, your personhood. And a

88
00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.550
lot of times we can
get so engaged in the

89
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.870
work that we're doing, that
we don't actually manage our

90
00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.080
person, who we are, our
humanity, our health, our balance,

91
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.770
our, our mind, and we
can burn out and we

92
00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.530
can crash just like an
airplane can. Yeah. And I

93
00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.560
think that to my point
about how I kind of,

94
00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.160
you know, in appropriately called
things hard skills and soft

95
00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.430
skills is that computer people
in tech people, myself included

96
00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.720
tend to depersonalize our person
ness and think that we

97
00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.200
are just compilers that happen
to be, you know, made

98
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.380
of flesh and bone. And
we're not computers this week.

99
00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.550
We simply can't behave like
that. We know. Absolutely. And

100
00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.580
it's interesting that you use
the term depersonalization cause I

101
00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.440
am an academic. So just
to make sure we're all

102
00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.500
on the same page, there
are three dimensions of burnout

103
00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.310
and one of them is
emotional exhaustion. And when we

104
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.980
talk about burnout is something
that's chronic that you feel

105
00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:04.670
like you can't come out
of. And the second component

106
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:08.660
that relates to what you
just said is depersonalization. And

107
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.590
what happens is when you
are burned out, you, you

108
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.740
do lose the personhood of
people that you're working with.

109
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.170
So an example that we
like to use is if

110
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:21.650
you went to a nurse's
office or to a doctor's

111
00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:24.380
office, an appointment, and you
said, Oh, I'm here to

112
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.020
see my friend. And they're
like, Oh, well the broken

113
00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:31.250
leg is in room two.
Well basically you've completely dehumanized

114
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.700
that person. And it's just
a person or an object

115
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.400
that needs to be fixed.
And when you get to

116
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.550
a level of depersonalization in
other people, or even in

117
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:44.390
yourself, that could mean that
there is a detachment that's

118
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:47.390
happening there and you could
be overwhelmed. So you're just

119
00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:50.600
focusing on lasering in on
what you can do because

120
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.090
you realize that, Oh my
God, I'm just spent, I

121
00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:55.670
have nothing else to give.
I can only focus on

122
00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:00.170
the essentials here. And sometimes
humanity and personhood gets lost

123
00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:03.880
in that You think that
that's something that is worse

124
00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:08.170
or exacerbated by the personalities
and the work that we

125
00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:11.170
do in tech. It seems
like we refer sometimes the

126
00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:16.030
tech workers as resources and
things become depersonalized well before

127
00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:19.630
burnout. Like they become culturally
depersonalized, which might mean that

128
00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:23.080
tech workers are more likely
to burn out. That's a

129
00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.570
great question. And one of
the things that I want

130
00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:28.240
to not discover when we're
doing research here is that

131
00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.810
some groups that tend to
be more likely to be

132
00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:34.600
burned out are those that
are engaged and to be

133
00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.000
a person who works in
tech, you have to really,

134
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.460
really be engaged in your
work. And hopefully you love

135
00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:42.040
it. And most of the
times you do, and you

136
00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:45.280
would think that some research
or previous research said, well,

137
00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:49.000
maybe engagement is the antonym
to burnout. But no, what

138
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.450
we really found out is
that people that are really,

139
00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:55.000
really engaged are the ones
that are most susceptible to

140
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.480
burnout. So you're saying, is
it cultural? Absolutely. It can

141
00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:00.970
be cultural because in order
for you to do, to

142
00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:03.580
be a great developer, to
be a great program, or

143
00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:05.740
to be a great coder,
you have to really be

144
00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:08.890
involved. And that involvement that
takes you in and sucks

145
00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:11.590
you in could be the
same thing that can lead

146
00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:14.950
you down the road of
burnout. Oh, interesting. That is

147
00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:18.190
kind of the, it's funny
how these things are counterintuitive.

148
00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:20.050
Like if I give too
much, if I am too

149
00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:22.600
empathetic, that's in fact what
I am doing, I'm giving

150
00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:27.190
a resource, a finite resource.
So what, what is that

151
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:30.070
you say giving of yourself?
There's no real word for

152
00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:34.450
one's emotional resource. Well, I
mean, I, I think one

153
00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:36.910
mentioned to you that also
study creativity and to be

154
00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:39.580
creative, there are, there are
three components. There are, you

155
00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:42.100
have to have domain skills,
you have to have creativity

156
00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:44.650
skills. And one of them
is intrinsic motivation. So if

157
00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:47.290
you were to ask me,
what is it that I'm

158
00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:51.340
giving? It's that intrinsic motivation,
meaning that I'm not doing

159
00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:53.590
this for a reward. I'm
not doing this for a

160
00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:56.610
promotion. I'm not doing this
impress anyone. I actually do

161
00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:59.040
love this. And that's a
good thing. And when you

162
00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:01.260
think about it, I don't
know if you love music

163
00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:02.760
or not, but I know
I do. You don't have

164
00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:04.530
a lot of, a lot
of times people say, Oh

165
00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:07.890
man, that first album by
that artist was excellent. But

166
00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:10.680
that second album, I don't
know what happened. And what

167
00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:13.980
had happened is is that
when you're intrinsically motivated, you're

168
00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:17.310
not distracted about anything external
to you. So that first

169
00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:19.620
album from artists, they just
give their all not caring

170
00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:22.770
about anything. But that second
album, a lot of times,

171
00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:26.520
now you have, you know,
your boss and your manager

172
00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:28.380
and the record company saying,
Oh, we've got to do

173
00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:30.270
this. And you made 10 million
here. Now we need to

174
00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:34.080
make 20 million there. Those external
forces come in. And then

175
00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:37.800
that takes away from that
laser focus and your ability

176
00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.780
to kind of hone in
on what you love. So

177
00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:43.080
if you ask me, what
is that intangible thing that

178
00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:47.280
can sometimes get out of
control? Intrinsic motivation is a

179
00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:50.550
good thing, but if you
take it too far and

180
00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:53.610
you can never disconnect or
turn off, it can become

181
00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:56.540
something destructive in your life
That I really liked that

182
00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:58.940
term. I am going to
use that. That is, that

183
00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:01.790
is exactly what it is.
There is a tank of

184
00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:06.650
motivation of, I think there's
also been papers and some

185
00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:10.190
recent articles about the idea
of willpower is a, is

186
00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:14.990
a finite resource. And oftentimes
people will say to either

187
00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:18.410
a depressed person or a
person who has an issue

188
00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:19.700
that they're trying to work
through, maybe they're trying to

189
00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:21.920
lose weight or get, get
fit. And they said, well,

190
00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:24.140
you know, just do it,
you know, just do it,

191
00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:26.390
right. This is like one
of the most iconic marketing

192
00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:28.760
terms of all time, just
do it, which is really

193
00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:34.940
saying, ignore that this is
a finite resource and simply

194
00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:39.080
push through that's. That is
a problematic statement. That is,

195
00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:42.260
that is ignoring that the
gas tank is on E

196
00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:46.250
keep driving. Yeah, absolutely. And
I think that one thing

197
00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:48.530
that we like to talk
about is that to be

198
00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:51.230
successful, you do have to
have balance. And one of

199
00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:55.970
those things is to interrogate
reality. And if, a lot

200
00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:58.340
of times we're so busy,
I can just think about

201
00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:00.770
when I was getting my
dissertation and I had to

202
00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:03.050
write the papers and I
had deadlines and all this

203
00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:06.710
stuff going on. I didn't
even realize if I had

204
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:08.900
a headache or I didn't
realize if I was tired,

205
00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:10.640
I would look up and
it would be midnight. And

206
00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:12.800
all this time went by,
well, I loved what I

207
00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:15.800
was doing and I was
completely engaged. But what was

208
00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:19.070
happening is I was losing
touch with my, who I

209
00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:21.050
am the core of who
I am. And in some

210
00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:23.990
ways I created my best
work, but it also took

211
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:27.080
a toll on my body
as well. It's interesting that

212
00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.940
you bring up the idea
that you were doing your

213
00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:32.750
best work, you enjoying yourself,
but you didn't notice that

214
00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:35.450
the tank was becoming depleted.
I think that we think

215
00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:39.530
about burnout as something that
people would notice, but you

216
00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:41.540
kind of just implied that
it can sneak up on

217
00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:44.390
you. Absolutely. And I think
that one of the solutions

218
00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:46.670
that am one, and I
like to talk about is

219
00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:49.160
that one of the ways
that you can manage the

220
00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:53.650
burndown is relationships. So partners
and you know, it could

221
00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:56.480
be a friend, it could
be a spouse. It could,

222
00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:58.810
it could be a team
member. And I know for

223
00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:02.680
me, everyone can tell my
husband, I'm a Nika. You

224
00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:05.030
know, maybe we need to
take a break here or

225
00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:07.390
maybe we should go for
a walk or something like

226
00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:10.330
that. So, yes, because we
are engaged people and we're

227
00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:14.860
highly capable. There is an,
an opportunity for us to

228
00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:17.260
lose touch. And we may
need others who care about

229
00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.440
us to kind of step
in and provide some possible

230
00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:24.670
solutions are possible outlets for
us to kind of disengaged,

231
00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:27.130
kind of regroup, fill that
tank back up and then

232
00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:30.690
dive back in. Right. And
not everyone necessarily has those

233
00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:33.420
close connections on everyone has
a partner. So you have

234
00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:36.540
to ask yourself, look inside
yourself and say, am I

235
00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:38.550
an introvert? Or am I
an extrovert? Am I someone

236
00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:41.490
who goes, where do I
go for my energy? Is

237
00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:44.010
it video games? Is it
a support group? Is it

238
00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:47.340
simply going outside and walking
in the sunshine, but catching

239
00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:49.980
yourself and I've done it
before. I think we all

240
00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:52.680
have coders or catching yourself
after six hours and not

241
00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:54.420
moving in front of the
computer. And you go like,

242
00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:57.450
Oh, what have I just
done? Time? Time has just

243
00:12:57.450 --> 00:13:00.030
teleported me into the future
and I'm hurting. I need

244
00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:02.880
to stop. Absolutely. And I
completely agree with what you

245
00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.820
said and another book that
we we've discussed. And when

246
00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:08.760
I was a book called
quiet and you're correct, that

247
00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:14.700
introverts do require sometimes quiet
time to kind of rebuild

248
00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:16.860
and energize and word another
mixed marriage. And that I'm

249
00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:20.250
an extrovert. So when I
get, when I get, you

250
00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:22.350
know, down or what have
you, I want to go

251
00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:25.410
to, you know, a gathering
or to some kind of

252
00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:28.020
park and go and meet
new people and talk and

253
00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:30.420
do those types of things.
So yes, you're absolutely right.

254
00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:33.270
Regardless of what the situation
is, you have to know

255
00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:36.450
yourself, spend some time and
do the things that work

256
00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:38.520
for you. If it is
video games, if it's reading

257
00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.920
a book, if it's going
a walk, whatever it is,

258
00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:44.490
we have to try to
make sure that we stay

259
00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:48.480
balanced and connected with where
we are. So things don't

260
00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:51.270
just overtake us out of
nowhere. Yeah. And I think

261
00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:53.490
the thing that I'm hearing
in, everything that you're talking

262
00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:57.720
about is this idea of
an intro and introspective analysis.

263
00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:01.440
It's funny that we analyze
code. We analyze problems all

264
00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:05.100
the time and we schedule
meetings to analyze problems, but

265
00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:08.280
I don't know how often
coders sit down and put

266
00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:12.540
up one hour meeting on
the calendar that says, analyze

267
00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:15.180
myself, look inside myself and
really just sit there and

268
00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:17.730
ask myself the question. What
do I need to refill

269
00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:20.160
this tank? So I don't
burn out. Yeah. And I

270
00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.710
think when you, what you
mentioned earlier about culture, I

271
00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:24.540
think that it's a cultural
thing and I used to

272
00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:26.610
be a consultant. I used
to work for Accenture and

273
00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:28.470
I used to work for
cap Gemini, Ernst and young

274
00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:31.560
as well. And I think
that if companies put a

275
00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:38.850
priority on their helping their
employees pursue wellness, then that

276
00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:42.150
would trickle down leaders. Leadership
starts at the top. So

277
00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:45.180
if you have a company
that says, Oh, okay, we

278
00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:48.210
need to do yoga or
let's schedule some yoga and

279
00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:51.060
we'll have this team, or
this group from two to

280
00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:54.200
we'll do that. Or, you
know, as some countries, they

281
00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:58.610
spend time in Asian nations,
you know, stretching or what

282
00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:02.390
have you before work. And
so it's, it's, it's a

283
00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:07.430
mentality, it's a mentality. And
we do have a situation

284
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:10.010
where many of us live
in the States and we

285
00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:14.360
have a Protestant work ethic
where the work itself is

286
00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:17.840
valuable and it, it makes
us feel important and that

287
00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:20.990
we have meaning and, and
dignity. And if we're not

288
00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:23.990
working, a lot of people
feel like, well, there's no

289
00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:27.200
I'm not contributing to anything.
So I'm, I'm just here.

290
00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:29.480
But sometimes the best thing
that you can do for

291
00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:32.990
yourself as go take a
nap, but that's not, that's

292
00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:37.250
not a concept that is
really in my opinion, or

293
00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:40.790
in my experience and in
my reading addressed or discussed

294
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:43.520
or implemented in a, in
a real way. And the,

295
00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:46.540
in the organizations that we're
working in these days, That's

296
00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:48.820
really significant. A lot of
people who listen to this

297
00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:51.670
podcast are not in the
U S are not in

298
00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:54.880
Western countries. So if you're
listening to this show, be

299
00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:57.430
empathetic and think about how
every country is different. Every

300
00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:59.290
culture is different. And you
just brought up something really

301
00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:03.850
interesting that you and I,
as Americans have for better

302
00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:06.010
or worse, been brought up
with this idea that the

303
00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:10.870
work itself, as opposed to
recharge me. And we have

304
00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:13.150
the sense of guilt that
we're not even supposed to

305
00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:15.610
take vacation. How many people
do we know who have

306
00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:19.390
lost vacation hours because they
filled up their bucket of

307
00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:22.330
vacation hours and then forfeited
them at the end of

308
00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:25.000
the year. EV everyone I
know has done that at

309
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.640
some point or another in
America, while it seems like

310
00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:32.140
other nations are culturally more
comfortable with taking vacation unapologetically.

311
00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:35.020
Absolutely. And a lot of
times it's, it's almost like

312
00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:37.030
a little bit of a,
of a battle or a

313
00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:39.160
badge of honor of, Oh,
I didn't, I haven't taken

314
00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:41.590
any vacation or I've been
here since five in the

315
00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:45.190
morning. And, and, and what
we have to realize is

316
00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:47.290
that, you know, that's only
something that you can do

317
00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:51.040
for so long. That's a
short term plan because you

318
00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:54.280
need your best self. So
you can be the best

319
00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:57.640
coder and, and really see
those nuances and see the

320
00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:00.670
have vision for where we're
going with this project. And

321
00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:03.610
if I'm burned out, I
really don't have the resources

322
00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:06.340
to do that. So it's
kind of a, a change

323
00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:08.680
of a way that we're
looking at things. I know

324
00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:11.680
that there's some articles out
there where people say, you

325
00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:14.290
know, I'll rebel. Then I
left work at five or

326
00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:16.810
leaving work at five was
like a rebellious thing to

327
00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:20.020
do. So we really have
to kind of think about

328
00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:22.960
this and, and look at
it from a longterm view,

329
00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:27.670
if you want your people
to be the most productive.

330
00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:29.650
And in the terms that
I always think of is

331
00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:32.200
people to be, you want
them to be the most

332
00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:35.680
efficient and effective they can
be. We have to also

333
00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:39.130
look at the wellness of
the employees and the organizations

334
00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:42.970
in which they work. Hey,
friends, summers longer days and

335
00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:45.910
slower pace. Invite us to
pick up a book, follow

336
00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:49.200
our questions and try our
hand at something new. The

337
00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:51.930
work of modern software developers
is evolving in ways that

338
00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:55.530
are both challenging and rewarding.
As a developer, it's essential

339
00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:59.010
that you cultivate a security
mindset and to help we've

340
00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:03.240
put together a collection of
information, security books, podcasts, blogs,

341
00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:07.410
and hands on exercises recommended
by Vira coders, across our

342
00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:11.610
development security and product teams
from a just published page

343
00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:15.360
Turner to classic frac articles.
There's something here for everyone

344
00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:18.750
who is interested in becoming
more security minded. So dip

345
00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:22.230
your toes in, or take
a deep dive visit www

346

dot Vira code that's V
E R a covid.com/reading that's

347
00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:36.620
Vira code.com/reading in your talk
at lead dev New York. You

348
00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:39.330
have a slide that says
the wrath of work ism.

349
00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:43.220
I have never heard that
word work ism. Well work

350
00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:46.010
is a miss is correlated
in some way with the

351
00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:48.500
Protestant work ethic. And what
that, what that really is,

352
00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:52.880
is talking about is, again,
that the, the value of

353
00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:57.230
my humanity is tied to
my work, meaning that if

354
00:18:57.230 --> 00:18:59.840
things are not going well
at my work, then they're

355
00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:02.300
not going well in my
personal life. There, there is

356
00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:07.820
a relationship, a, a tangible
relationship there. And what happens

357
00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:11.060
is things at work sometimes
occur that are not the

358
00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:12.920
best, and it has nothing
to do with me. You

359
00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:16.760
know, the economy might take
a hit, or maybe a,

360
00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:19.820
you know, a piece of
software that we're working with

361
00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:22.430
may not do what we
wanted to do, but that

362
00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:24.890
had nothing to do with
me. But since I'm so

363
00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:28.490
correlated and tied into it,
it touches who I am.

364
00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:32.510
And I feel less than
because my work is taking

365
00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:37.460
a hit <inaudible> and this
causes physical, not just this,

366
00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:40.250
isn't just mental. Like you
can physically break your body.

367
00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:43.460
You can burn burning down
illness. Like you can become

368
00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:51.020
ill physically and, and, and
exacerbate underlying conditions. Yeah. Unfortunately

369
00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:54.230
we live in a, in
a very stressed out society

370
00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:56.030
and in a lot of
people, and a lot of

371
00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:59.330
research was suggests it has
something to do with number

372
00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:01.850
one, it's really a struggle
for people to have work

373
00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:04.670
life balance. So if I'm
doing well at work, I'm

374
00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:06.920
not doing well at home.
Or if I'm doing well

375
00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:09.110
at home, I'm not doing
well at work. And the

376
00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:12.380
quick example was that I'll
ask him one sometimes, Oh,

377
00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:14.540
well, maybe you can come
home early. Well, he may

378
00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:17.440
come home early and I'll
be happy, but his boss

379
00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:20.300
may not be happy because
he is not finishing something

380
00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:22.790
that needed to be finished.
Or his boss, Eddie fetal

381
00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:24.830
work label. Then the boss
is happy, but then me

382
00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:27.980
and the kids aren't happy.
So it's this, this constant

383
00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:31.760
war that a lot of
people live under in terms

384
00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:35.060
of illness, stress is the
root cause of a lot

385
00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:38.870
of illnesses. People are dealing
with all types of challenges

386
00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:45.530
and decreasing stress can help
provide health for your body

387
00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:49.300
because the stress, something that
is Leighton. I know for

388
00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:51.640
me, when I was getting
my dissertation and I was

389
00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:54.220
working really, really hard, I
started grinding my teeth, Scott,

390
00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:56.830
and I didn't even know
that it was happening. And

391
00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:59.440
then I woke up and
finally, my, my job was

392
00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:01.270
hurting and I went to
the dentist and that's what

393
00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:03.780
was happening. And it was
stress and it was stressed

394
00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:06.880
out. Even know that I
was experiencing. Cause once again,

395
00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:09.160
I was doing what I
love. That was, I was

396
00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:12.190
up all night. I was
engaged and I was used,

397
00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:14.830
I was, you know, firing
on all cylinders, but it

398
00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:18.210
took a toll on my
body over time. My goodness,

399
00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:22.290
that sounds like there's also
a leadership issue there where

400
00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:25.020
a leader needs to be
able to help their team

401
00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:28.080
with burnout, but they might
be burned out themselves. So

402
00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:31.200
then it's a vicious cycle.
Absolutely. And again, this, this

403
00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:34.380
start, it's all about the
tone. It's the tone. It's

404
00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:37.830
the tone at the top
on we value, we, we

405
00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:42.390
appreciate our people. We want
people to live balanced lives,

406
00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:45.000
or you could work somewhere
where your bosses, all they

407
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.090
care about is the work.
And you're just like, you

408
00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:50.280
talked about it at the
very beginning. You know, you're

409
00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:53.640
just a Cod you're, you're
just a piece in a

410
00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:57.630
manufacturing system here, you know,
humanity is completely removed. So

411
00:21:57.870 --> 00:22:01.590
the tone, the culture is
very powerful and plays a

412
00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:04.470
huge role in this situation.
So when you're trying to

413
00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:07.170
make an effective team and
efficient team, and you're trying

414
00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:10.860
to inspire people and fuel
them where I have found

415
00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:13.710
for myself that a leader
who is, who can give

416
00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:15.810
a good pep talk, a
pep talk from my boss

417
00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:17.700
can really get me going
for a couple of months,

418
00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:21.090
which is amazing, like a
20 minute conversation about what

419
00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:24.000
we're doing here at the
organization can fuel me for

420
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.700
a few months. And that's
really significant. But at the

421
00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:29.550
same time, if a boss
is like, Can you just

422
00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:31.680
take, you know, take, take
the weekend, whatever you need

423
00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:36.540
to do That could also
breed negative behaviors where without

424
00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:38.250
using, I don't know if
lazy is a bad word,

425
00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:41.280
but you could imply that
the work doesn't matter at

426
00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:45.090
all. Therefore people could start
being abusive with a program

427
00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:47.220
of all there's unlimited vacation.
Take the time you need,

428
00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:49.470
just get the work done.
How do you balance that?

429
00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:52.470
Getting stuff done with not
burning out? Yeah, well, I'll

430
00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:55.900
also, you know, have a
PhD in human resources. They

431
00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:58.590
come together and, and I
would say the solution to

432
00:22:58.590 --> 00:23:01.800
that is how you bring
people on. I mean, we

433
00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:04.470
want to bring on the
best people, right? So we,

434
00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:08.970
we interview people. We fly
people in. We make sure

435
00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:11.430
that there's a connection that,
and really that there's a

436
00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:14.670
passion for what people are
doing when you bring them

437
00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:17.250
on. And if you have
people like that, I think

438
00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:19.380
you're going to be hard
pressed to find people that

439
00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:21.900
want to, you know, you
know, what do they say?

440
00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:24.090
The, the mice will play
when the cats away? I

441
00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:26.630
think a lot of there's
a theory X out there

442
00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:29.220
in theory, X is really
a leadership style. That's command

443
00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:31.200
and control. And they kind
of believe that way. But

444
00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:34.950
a theory, Y leadership approach
is basically where I want

445
00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:37.980
to empower people. And I
feel like people are creative

446
00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:40.230
and they're innovative and they
want to do good work.

447
00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:44.310
So that comment will be
taken completely different depending on

448
00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:46.730
the type of that you're
hot that you hire. So

449
00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:50.120
what's the solution. You hire
the best people, the people

450
00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:52.250
who will have the skills
that are engaged and are

451
00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:55.970
passionate, and they will not
want to take advantage of

452
00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:59.030
any situation where they feel
like they're taking time off.

453
00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:01.370
They're really genuinely going to
take that time off to

454
00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:04.310
re refill that tank that
we were talking about, and

455
00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:06.620
then continue to dive back
in and do the work

456
00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:08.680
that they need to do.
So it sounds like the

457
00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:10.960
leader really needs to think
about the behaviors that they

458
00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:15.100
are modeling as well. And
if your boss looks and

459
00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:18.580
exudes burnout and stressed out,
or they're sending emails to

460
00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:22.510
you at 2:00 AM on a
Friday night, then they're not,

461
00:24:23.050 --> 00:24:24.340
you know, it's one of
those do, as I say,

462
00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:26.950
not as I do type
of situations and the organization

463
00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:29.920
will notice that. Absolutely. Yeah,
definitely. We get our cues

464
00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:32.520
from the top. No doubt
about it. Okay. So then

465
00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:34.990
that implies that if you
are, but if you're being

466
00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:37.390
compassionate, you're not trying to
say I'm letting you off

467
00:24:37.390 --> 00:24:39.790
the hook, or I'm being
lazy as an organization. We

468
00:24:39.790 --> 00:24:43.360
are literally creating a psychologically
safe place for, for the

469
00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:46.540
worker. Yeah. And there there's
a construct in organizational paper

470
00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:49.600
that is entitled is psychological
safety, what you just said.

471
00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:54.250
And basically if I, if
I work somewhere and, and

472
00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:57.880
things aren't going well, and
I feel concerned about communicating

473
00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:00.550
that that is a sign
that either there's not a

474
00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:03.730
good fit here, or we
need to have a conversation

475
00:25:03.970 --> 00:25:06.250
or something needs to happen
to alter that because I

476
00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:10.630
should be able to bring
my full self to work

477
00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:13.150
and contribute and be a
part of the team That's

478
00:25:13.150 --> 00:25:16.840
really significant. And I know
that sometimes in least in

479
00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:19.540
the Western culture, we tried
to get around the idea

480
00:25:19.690 --> 00:25:24.370
of, I, I want to
have a psychologically safe workplace

481
00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:27.640
with this idea of the
open door policy, which implies

482
00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:29.890
that anyone at any level
can just wander into a

483
00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:33.880
boss's office and say, Hey,
I have a problem, which

484
00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:36.820
sounds great on its face,
but it's self can be

485
00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:38.920
a stressor because then you
feel like you only got

486
00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:40.600
so many of those. I
don't want to be high

487
00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:43.090
maintenance it's I could get
out of jail free card.

488
00:25:43.090 --> 00:25:44.710
Like how many times can
I really wander into the

489
00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:48.400
CEO's office? I don't, I
don't email Satya at Microsoft

490
00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:51.220
every 20 minutes because you
know, we're out of free

491
00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:55.450
soda pop. So them saying,
I have a open door

492
00:25:55.450 --> 00:25:58.960
policy itself stresses me out.
Right? Absolutely. I understand what

493
00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:01.030
you're saying. And what really,
what I hear you talking

494
00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:03.760
about is the fact that
in many organizations, we have

495
00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:07.840
a hierarchy, so smaller organizations
and in terms of structure

496
00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:10.420
are flat. So if we
were a startup, you may

497
00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:12.850
not feel that that anxiety
or anyone may not feel

498
00:26:12.850 --> 00:26:15.130
the anxiety about going down
to the boss's office. Just

499
00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:16.900
five of us here are
10 of us. What have

500
00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:21.430
you. But as organizations grow,
we tend to establish hierarchy.

501
00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:24.790
Human beings put established Archy
at anything. There's a heart

502
00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:27.730
I'm on the PTO board.
There's a hierarchy there. So

503
00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:31.390
the thing about that is
when you do have an

504
00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:35.770
open door policy, we do
self-assess and say, is this

505
00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:38.800
a meaningful thing to say,
or, or what have you,

506
00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:40.990
but what we have to
do is decide, you know

507
00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:43.200
what? This is something that's
key. This is something that

508
00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:45.780
I really need to discuss.
Of course we don't want

509
00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:48.120
to go in with, with
little things here and there.

510
00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:50.880
But if there's something that
is really touching you or

511
00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:54.240
something that's on your mind,
I think that having that

512
00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:57.150
open door policy and utilizing
it when you need, it

513
00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:00.630
is an important thing. And
your boss or your managers,

514
00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:02.520
many times they want to
hear from you. I know

515
00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:04.620
for me, I go in
and I talk to my

516
00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:07.800
chair when things are on
my mind and I don't

517
00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:10.110
bug him all the time,
but if there's something going

518
00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:13.230
on and, and generally when
you have a healthy boss

519
00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:15.840
or a healthy relationship, they're
pleased to see you and

520
00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:18.680
they want to hear what
you have to say. All

521
00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:20.360
right. Well, let me ask
a hard question then. Cause

522
00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:22.130
I think this is one
that everyone's thinking, but no

523
00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:24.410
one actually wants to say
out loud. Okay. When is

524
00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:29.760
it appropriate to quit to
get away from burnout? That

525
00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:33.020
is really a real question
because you know, life is

526
00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:35.050
short, in my opinion, if
you ask me and I,

527
00:27:35.050 --> 00:27:37.280
and I believe that if
you, you should do what

528
00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:39.560
you love and the money
will follow up. That's another

529
00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:42.590
one of my philosophies. And
the thing about is I

530
00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:44.900
understand we have mortgages and
we have bills and we

531
00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:48.200
do have to live, but
after you've tried to develop

532
00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:52.130
your internal network, after you've
spent time, making sure that

533
00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:56.090
you're building relationships and, and
going to, you know, different

534
00:27:56.090 --> 00:27:59.330
events in your area, in
your field of study, you've

535
00:27:59.330 --> 00:28:03.860
tried to, you know, have
yoga on campus. You've read

536
00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:07.010
books, you've meditated, you've done
all these things and you're

537
00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:10.250
still stressed out. You're still
not sleeping. Well, you're still

538
00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:12.980
grinding your teeth or what
have you. Sometimes you do

539
00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:16.070
have to pull yourself out
of the situation, hopefully after,

540
00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:19.010
you know, saving some money
and really having some nice

541
00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:22.130
fillers out there. But there
is a point if you

542
00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:26.240
ask me, there is a
point where my health cause

543
00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:28.520
to me, health as well.
And if my health has

544
00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:32.660
taken such a strong hit,
then there may be an

545
00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:35.360
opportunity or a time for
me to maybe do something

546
00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:37.810
different than what I'm currently
doing. If it's just, if

547
00:28:37.810 --> 00:28:41.330
it's becoming too much, but
again, organizations should want their

548
00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:44.630
people to be healthy because
a healthy employee is going

549
00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:46.580
to be doing healthy work.
They're going to be, you

550
00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:48.890
know, providing healthy code. They're
going to be a healthy

551
00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:51.740
team member. So it's, it's
not a negative thing. So

552
00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:55.820
it's that, it's that reframing
of work and wellness and

553
00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:59.180
balance that we need to
be having a discussion about

554
00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:02.150
income in organization, Indeed. And
it seems like if a

555
00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:04.550
good reason to leave would
be, if that is not

556
00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:08.720
respected as a value, if
humans themselves and their humanity

557
00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:12.080
is not respected as an
organization, then if you are

558
00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:13.850
not enabled to fix that,
cause you're not at the

559
00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:17.300
top, that's a good reason
to pull the ripcord. Absolutely.

560
00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:20.420
Yeah. Changing your working environment,
I think can be really

561
00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:24.200
overwhelming for, for someone and
not everyone has that luxury.

562
00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:25.640
And I wouldn't have that
privilege to be able to

563
00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:28.880
go and quit. That can
be a very, very stressful.

564
00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:32.540
Absolutely no doubt about it.
So I'm hearing that you

565
00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:35.630
shouldn't be too hard on
yourself. It is not like

566
00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:39.230
burning out is not a
personal failing though. Like everyone

567
00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:41.000
burns out. This is not
a thing where you just

568
00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:44.020
take a nap and everything's
fine. You really have to

569
00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:46.740
look inside yourself. Yeah. Again,
I know I'm giving a

570
00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:50.280
lot of my little statements
here, but I allow myself

571
00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:53.730
to be human. That's the
thing. And if I am

572
00:29:53.730 --> 00:29:56.700
feeling tired, I'm tired. And
if I feel like I'm

573
00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:59.340
giving my all, I've given
my all, and I know

574
00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:02.520
that, and I can't let
anyone make me feel small

575
00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:06.390
or that I am not,
you know, a respected person

576
00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:08.070
because I need to take
a nap or take a

577
00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:10.830
vacation or, you know, have
a break or what, what

578
00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:13.650
have you. So yes, we
want to allow ourselves to

579
00:30:13.650 --> 00:30:17.520
be human and, and really
build that relationship with your

580
00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:19.710
boss as much as you
can, or with your team

581
00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:22.410
as much as you can
so that they can see

582
00:30:22.410 --> 00:30:25.170
you as a person and
not just a, you know,

583
00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:29.040
output or, you know, a
contributor, but an actual human

584
00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:32.430
being behind the work. I
think that's really important. Yeah.

585
00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:35.010
That one has been interesting.
I've watched people on different

586
00:30:35.010 --> 00:30:38.190
teams, at least at Microsoft
and IBM in big companies

587
00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:41.850
that I've worked with where
some folks come to work.

588
00:30:41.850 --> 00:30:44.220
Like you said, extroverts, go
out to get their energy.

589
00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:46.980
They come to work and
they get energy from genuine

590
00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:49.590
work friendships. While other people
say I didn't come to

591
00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:53.730
work to make friendships. That's
also cultural. Some people go

592
00:30:53.730 --> 00:30:56.400
to work, meet, meet friends,
and have barbecues with them

593
00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:58.890
afterwards while others say, I
want to get the work

594
00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:01.500
done. And I'm not interested
in being your friend. Absolutely.

595
00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:03.660
And what that is is
you have to have healthy

596
00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:07.110
boundaries that work for you.
That definitely that work for

597
00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:10.380
some people is, is a
place to socialize and, and

598
00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:14.040
really have friends that even
become family. And there's nothing

599
00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:15.780
wrong with that. But what
it, what it is is

600
00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:18.450
you have to make sure
that our, we have to

601
00:31:18.450 --> 00:31:21.120
make sure that we get
involved in a situation that

602
00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:24.270
works for us, because for
a person that wants that

603
00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:27.030
healthy boundary and you try
to keep pulling them in

604
00:31:27.030 --> 00:31:29.910
to be light family within,
that becomes stressful for them.

605
00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:33.600
So really it's just about
respecting people and their personal

606
00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:37.110
principles and values. I mean,
everyone's different. We have to

607
00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:39.840
respect where people are coming
from. We're here to do

608
00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:42.090
the job. And if you
want more than go for

609
00:31:42.090 --> 00:31:44.280
it, if you need that
healthy boundary, then that's okay

610
00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:47.160
too. You know, that really
hit me for a second

611
00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:49.230
there because I have worked
at companies where someone was

612
00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:51.000
like, we're all a family.
And I'm just like, you

613
00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.490
know, I don't want to
be like, I like you

614
00:31:53.490 --> 00:31:57.960
all, but I'm not your
family. Right, right. At home.

615
00:31:57.980 --> 00:32:02.550
You're keeping me from them.
Exactly. Yes. Yes. Fantastic. Well,

616
00:32:02.550 --> 00:32:04.800
thank you so much, dr.
