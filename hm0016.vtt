00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.260
web tools. Text-based utilities, source
code, and other Hansel minutia.

9
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.090
Hi, this is Carl Franklin. You're
listening. Two Hansel minutes. Show

10
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.380
number 15, Hansel minutia. Number
one. Hi Scott. Hi Carl.

11
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.960
How are you? So rather
than having a theme, we're

12
00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.260
sort of scatterbrained today, right?
Well, I wouldn't say scatterbrain.

13
00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.480
I would say that I'm
de fragmenting the Hanselman. It's

14
00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.540
trying to get all the
different little things that didn't

15
00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.500
fit into a large thematic
show. The Hansel minutiae altogether.

16
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.110
I'm really getting tired of
all the Hansel puns that

17
00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.150
are being sent out. Okay.
So basically, yeah, You got

18
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:27.920
to defrag the hard drive
from once in a while.

19
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.180
So this is defragging In
fact it is web tools,

20
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.730
got some web tools for
us today. Yeah. A couple

21
00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.730
of cool things that came
across the email today. One

22
00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.580
of them was a thing
called clip.net, except spell clip

23
00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.630
with a one you go
cl one p.net or for

24
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.800
the shrinks to people@theirshrinks.com slash
E I V with all

25
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.260
the Ray Ozzie stuff, going
around with his live internet

26
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.280
clipboard and micro formats and
stuff. Web 2.0, came up

27
00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.420
with their own solution called
clip.net, the internet clipboard. And

28
00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.290
basically it's a fairly manual
and hacky, but incredibly clever

29
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.770
way to copy paste between
computers. So if you go

30
00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:13.160
to shrinks.com/e w, which is
actually an alias for clip.net/hansel

31
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.340
minutes, you'll see some texts
that I pasted there earlier.

32
00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.550
So if you've ever got
to go around firewalls, or

33
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.340
you want to paste a
whole lot of text to

34
00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.560
someone, you can just go
up there. It's like, you

35
00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.910
could go up there right
now. Carl would go to

36
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.260
cl one p.net/and then putting
whatever you want, like slash

37
00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.010
Carl Franklin. And if that doesn't
already exist as a clipboard,

38
00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.410
you'll get a big text
box. You can paste a

39
00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.300
whole bunch of stuff there
and then send someone that

40
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.100
link and they'll be able
to pick it up or

41
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.460
you can up upload files
up to two megs. Wow.

42
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.650
I like it in size.
Yeah. So as long as

43
00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.830
you're not putting private information
up there and private files,

44
00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.930
you can move files of
up to two megs and

45
00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.280
big chunks of clipboard information.
Pretty clever. They've got about

46
00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.290
30,000 clips up there. Very
cool stuff. Very cool. So

47
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.600
in the, in the interest
of being of sharing, I'm

48
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.850
on the delicious bandwagon. I
don't know if I've got

49
00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.430
you hooked on delicious yet.
I am hooked. You are

50
00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.800
on delicious. Isn't it? It's
just, it's very cool. It's

51
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.940
fantastic. So this is Del
dot ICI O dot U

52
00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.780
S. It's basically delicious with
dots strategically placed within the

53
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.480
word, the delicious dots. Yeah.
And you can go to

54
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.320
my delicious list at <inaudible>
dot com slash E ex.

55
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.740
And the thing that is,
people look at it, malicious

56
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.510
thing. I don't quite get
it. I don't quite understand

57
00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.340
what delicious is all about,
but you've just got to

58
00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.700
give it a day of
your time. And instead of

59
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.970
putting things in your bookmarks
or trying to save Earls

60
00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.710
and a text field, try
delicious, it's a social bookmarker.

61
00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.010
The thing that's interesting about
a delicious from my point

62
00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.680
of view, isn't that right?
You can store all of

63
00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.350
your information up there it's
that you can see information

64
00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.480
that other people have tagged,
right? So I can go

65
00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.680
and say delicious slash S
Hanselman cause as Hanselman's my

66
00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.690
username slash and then the
name of one of my

67
00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.530
tags. So delicious slash S
Hanselman slash MSH. And I

68
00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.510
can see all of the
things that I have tagged

69
00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.620
with MSH MSH is the
Microsoft shell. We'll talk about

70
00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.840
it a little later. It's
now changed its name, but

71
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.670
what's cool is that I
could say, well, what are

72
00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.120
other people tagging with MSH?
What are other people, what

73
00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.100
are popular? Things that are
tagged with MSH, and then

74
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.230
I can copy them into
my list. So it's the

75
00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:25.470
power of bookmarking along with
the power of the entire

76
00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.430
web, also bookmarking and ranking,
right? Yeah. And these tag

77
00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.400
clouds built exactly like you're
saying the ranking, if it

78
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.850
seems that a particular page
is better tagged with something

79
00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.580
else, other than NSH, maybe
it should be tagged with

80
00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.750
monad or PowerShell or whatever.
The, the mob mentality of

81
00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.830
bookmarkers will eventually pick the
right tag. So what you

82
00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.160
mentioned PowerShell, what is PowerShell?
Well, PowerShell is the new

83
00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.220
name and isn't a lovely
name. It is a four

84
00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.530
monad that we did a
show on a couple of

85
00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.310
weeks ago. Aha. PowerShell is
the marketing version of the

86
00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:04.260
really awesome and kind of
like clever monad mysterious name.

87
00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:10.500
Nice. I actually blogged a
eulogy@ashrinkstir.com slash E I Y

88
00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.930
about mourning monad and a
PowerShell though. It is they've

89
00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.330
changed everything. The thing that's
kind of interesting, they've changed

90
00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.840
the extension from dot MSH
files to dot P S

91
00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.930
one, which means that the
next version of PowerShell will

92
00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.420
have a PS two extension.
Oh no. Which will make

93
00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:31.020
the PlayStation users very happy.
I'm sure. But one of

94
00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.340
the things with the name
change, Bruce Payette, a brilliant

95
00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.060
leader engineer on the PowerShell
project has come out with

96
00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:43.500
a, a chapter one free
free chapter of his PowerShell

97
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:48.180
and action upcoming book. You
can go to shrinks.com/e Z,

98
00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.780
Z, Z E I S.
Ed. And you can get

99
00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:55.530
a copy of that first
unedited chapter. This is going

100
00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:58.820
to be a, an insider's
view on the PowerShell with

101
00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.460
all the updated information you
can get the link directly

102
00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:06.500
to the PDF is shrink,
stir.com/j zero. And that's the

103
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.340
unedited draft source for his
chapters chapter one. And I

104
00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:13.130
read it yesterday and I
must say, I really liked

105
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.740
the style. And if you
are wondering what monad is,

106
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.520
what PowerShell is, this is
a really quick read, very

107
00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.000
flowing language with a lot
of cool examples, a definitely

108
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.650
a chapter to check out
if you wanna get excited

109
00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:28.150
about being more effective from
the, We had a lot

110
00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:31.060
of great emails, feedback, a
lot of great feedback by

111
00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:34.450
email about the monad show
and so much so that

112
00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:39.760
we chose that as our
first installment in.net developers journal,

113
00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.820
we're doing a sort of
a synopsis of one of

114
00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:47.440
the shows that we've done
recently and just a transcript

115
00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:49.720
of a part of that
show. And we chose the

116
00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.780
monad show for the first
one. That was, that was

117
00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:54.040
a lot of fun. A
lot of people thought it

118
00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.110
would be weird to talk
about a command line over

119
00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:58.030
the, over the radio, but
I think we pulled it

120
00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:01.510
off. Yeah, I can almost,
I can almost talk in

121
00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:06.100
monospace font right now. Not
quite so speaking actually of

122
00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:09.220
a, of text mode and
things of that ilk, spending

123
00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:12.340
time at the command line.
I blogged recently about a,

124
00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:16.000
what I call the return
of Norton commander turns out,

125
00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:18.400
you know, and I had
forgotten about this, cause I

126
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.860
used to use this tool
called far a while back.

127
00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:24.430
It's a Russian tool, but
you know, Norton commander, that

128
00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:27.430
was the bomb. That was
the big blue two pain

129
00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:32.140
dos application. That was the
Shell of the preferred shell

130
00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:34.810
for dos. That's where I
spent all my time at

131
00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:36.400
Norton commander. Because the thing
that was cool about it

132
00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.260
is that you could fold
up the panes and still

133
00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.730
do your dos commands in
the background. So you knew

134
00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:44.530
you could do dos without
ever leaving Norton commander. It

135
00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:47.830
was wicked fast. It was
basically windows Explorer for DAS,

136
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:51.730
right? But it didn't suck.
And Oh man, that's cold.

137
00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:54.640
But some people have called
Norton commander, the greatest application

138
00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:57.850
ever written. And there's actually
a series of fan sites,

139
00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:03.460
including the commander homepage. And
there's a couple of applications

140
00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:05.890
out there. One of which
called far that I have

141
00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:08.590
get I'm getting back into
that Misha Burgle emailed me

142
00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:13.390
about, and all those links
are at shrinker.com/ <inaudible>. Okay.

143
00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:16.990
Far is a text mode,
Norton commander clone with full

144
00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:20.620
windows long file name support.
So you can be poking

145
00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:23.320
around and, you know, full
speed using two type fonts.

146
00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:26.260
I changed my font to
a, listed a console for

147
00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.020
an big, you know, big
screen text mode. No, this

148
00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:32.590
is far far. Does that
stand for something? Ah, you

149
00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:34.540
know, I don't know. I
don't think it does. It's

150
00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:38.830
it's the farm manager. Yeah.
And what's cool about it

151
00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:40.510
though, is that you not
only do you get full

152
00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:43.420
support for long file names,
but there's a whole rich

153
00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:47.140
plugin community such that it's
really impossible to look at

154
00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:50.410
far without its plugins. So
you can step into archives

155
00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:55.860
as if their directories it's
pretty amazing and turns out

156
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.560
I'm getting a whole lot
of comments on that post.

157
00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.890
I've got 14 at the
time of this, this recording

158
00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:05.610
and people are talking about,
there are other applications out

159
00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:07.770
there. I thought that'd be
like one dos application that

160
00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:10.650
would be filling this niche,
but there's a application called

161
00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:17.490
total commander directory, Opus, servant,
salamander Z tree when extra

162
00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:22.560
gold clones, these are all
applications vying for that valuable

163
00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:28.680
space. As number one, DOS-based
text mode, you know, file

164
00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:31.590
manager. I had no idea
I knew about far, but

165
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:35.160
did not realize there was
such a fervent group of

166
00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.560
fan boys out there. And
I'm going to have to

167
00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:39.660
go through step by step
and learn about all these

168
00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:41.850
other ones that I, that
I hadn't heard of. And

169
00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:44.300
maybe do a review sometime.
Well, why, When you think

170
00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:47.510
that there's this return to
text mode, utilities like this?

171
00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:51.320
Well, you know, text mode
is fast. It's guaranteed. It's

172
00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:53.690
it's. I actually did an
article on my blog a

173
00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:56.360
while back, I'll put a
shrink stir up. This was

174
00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:00.380
in 2000 and, and four.
I've got that up at

175
00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:06.350
shrink, stir.com/e J V that's
shrinks your.com/ejv. And I had

176
00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:10.970
blogged about to post I'd
called opportunity. Windows is missing

177
00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:13.760
the text mode boat because,
you know, I was over

178
00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:16.640
at Toyota service, getting my
car worked on and everyone

179
00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:20.540
was working on text mode.
You know, you go to

180
00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:23.000
a JC Penney's and you
buy something at a department

181
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.910
store. They're all typing in
a text mode when you

182
00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:28.010
go somewhere and you notice
that they have to reach

183
00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:29.870
for the mouse in order
to, you know, click and

184
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:31.730
open up the cash register.
Don't you kind of go,

185
00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:33.830
gosh, don't just in their
hot key to open the

186
00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:36.600
register. Yeah. Or a button
on the screen. Yeah. There's,

187
00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:39.590
there's a real or a
touchscreen. I don't think a

188
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:41.450
mouse and a keyboard are
really a point of sale

189
00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:44.360
kind of a thing. Definitely
not. But you know, I

190
00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.520
know I hate putting my
hands on the mouse when

191
00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:48.650
I'm writing code, but I
always have to reach for

192
00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:50.330
it when I want to
start dragging things around and

193
00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:54.080
explore. And there's just something
comforting about, about text mode.

194
00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:57.020
It's fast, it's clean, it's
crisp. There's nothing in the

195
00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:00.920
way, Especially data entry, right?
Yeah, totally. This is one

196
00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:03.380
of the biggest problems of,
you know, working in a

197
00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:07.550
asynchronous environment like windows is
windows will just pop up

198
00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:10.370
on you. Like you're typing,
you're entering some data and

199
00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:13.070
all of a sudden Boeing
something comes up and I

200
00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:15.800
am, comes up or something.
And all, you know, you

201
00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.840
type the last half of
your sentence to a friend

202
00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:20.240
of yours or something and
they steal your focus and

203
00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:24.350
you can prevent that with
the tweak UI tools that

204
00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:27.620
we talked about last week,
there's a setting in there

205
00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:31.220
to prevent other windows from
stealing your focus, but still,

206
00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:33.620
you know, it's not the
default behavior. Yeah. And I

207
00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:35.540
understand when I talk to
some of the guys on

208
00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:38.570
the Aero team at windows
Vista, that they are doing

209
00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:42.440
things to be a little
more formal about what windows

210
00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:44.300
are allowed to steal, focus
away from you and, and

211
00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:46.700
what aren't. Yeah. There's a
couple of interesting posts, I

212
00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:51.470
think at Raymond Chen side about
why exactly that happens in,

213
00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:53.500
you know, the internals of
windows, why someone, her allowed

214
00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:56.260
to pull full focus away
and some aren't cool. So

215
00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:59.020
couple of other cool applications
that I've been checking out

216
00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:03.010
a, one's actually an older
application called denim. And this

217
00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:06.640
is a, an informal tool
that you would use to

218
00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:10.690
prototype an application or typically
a website. This has been

219
00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:13.660
an app for a while,
but it's, it's a, it's

220
00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:16.870
over at the university of
Washington and this is been

221
00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:19.180
getting more and more advanced.
They've got version two out

222
00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:22.600
to Java based application that
runs on windows and Unix

223
00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:26.110
and Mac. And this is
cool. You actually draw your

224
00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:30.610
prototypes, just like using a
pen, you know, like, like

225
00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:33.520
you're drawing on a tablet,
PC, just sketching out kind

226
00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:34.750
of how you want things
to look. And then you

227
00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:36.910
might say, well, this button
is going to go over

228
00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:39.550
to that page. Then you
would draw that other page

229
00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:42.070
and then just draw a
line between the button and

230
00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:46.660
the page. And you're basically
building a hypertext, a demo,

231
00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:49.390
but what's cool is then
you hit export to HTML

232
00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:52.870
and then they use your
actual rough sketches and export

233
00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:56.880
your, your entire demo. How's
the HTML, that's the question?

234
00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:59.250
Well, basically what it is
is it's just an image

235
00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:02.550
of what you drew with
a bunch of image maps.

236
00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:04.920
So the idea is that
you're going to be giving

237
00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:06.990
them a live, you know,
it's like drawing on paper

238
00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:09.270
except you get the hypertext
feel. I get it. So

239
00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:13.380
you can do quick prototyping
of, of functional aspects. And

240
00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:17.280
it is prototyping. It's not
website building. No, exactly it

241
00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:19.770
is. It is prototyper. And
this has been around for

242
00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:21.540
a very long time and
it's a, it's a sketcher

243
00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:24.780
and they've got videos and
different examples of this up

244
00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:27.810
at <inaudible> dot com slash
EJB. And I've been a

245
00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:30.420
fan of this for a
number of years. I've used

246
00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:33.720
it a couple of times
on a project. And then

247
00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:37.680
I noticed that there is
a unrelated, but way more

248
00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:44.100
advanced commercial prototype or called
easy prototype@stringer.com slash EJC. Hmm.

249
00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:47.250
And this one actually lets
you take existing images and

250
00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:49.950
import them. So you could
be basically building your website

251
00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:53.640
on it, whiteboard, take a
picture of your whiteboard, import

252
00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:55.860
them into the tool and
then Mark the different hotspots

253
00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:59.400
and then build your prototype
from existing pencil sketches, existing

254
00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:02.880
digital photos. Wow. Make them
all interactive and then publish

255
00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:04.980
them as HTML and then
show them to the client

256
00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:07.770
and say, so kind of
like this, yeah. The speed

257
00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:10.290
that you could do, this
kind of prototyping versus writing

258
00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:14.040
the, you know, the application
yourself would be significant. Yeah,

259
00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:16.500
I bet. So you can
get that feedback loop started

260
00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:19.140
in a way earlier. This
is about making the pages

261
00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:22.860
interactive, not making them, making
them pretty sounds great. All

262
00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:24.720
right. Let's talk about some
source code. You found some

263
00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:27.960
good source code repositories this
week. I noticed that, you

264
00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:32.880
know, we had talked about
Sean McCormack last, last week

265
00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.610
and I ended up meeting
him in person for the

266
00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:41.730
second time@deeperin.net in Wisconsin, and
then come home here, log

267
00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:44.100
in Monday morning. And then
I see that he's released

268
00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:48.840
the underlying framework for his
two applications, codas and Zane

269
00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:51.980
bug they're up source. The
T's released out to the,

270
00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:56.960
the world@stringer.com slash <inaudible>. This
is an enterprise library that

271
00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:01.460
he is released. That includes
object caching, business rule validation,

272
00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:04.550
a really cool X path
navigator that you can basically

273
00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:09.020
navigate over objects using X
path, even though they're not

274
00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:10.880
XML, they just do you
have an object graph, you

275
00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:13.700
can walk around inside it.
Wow. He's got some pretty

276
00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:18.050
interesting cogeneration stuff and just
a bunch of really useful

277
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:22.550
classes that are, that are
utility based. I like the,

278
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:24.500
you know, the Microsoft enterprise
library, but it was really

279
00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:27.560
cool to see a smart
developer basically take all of

280
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:30.860
the chunks of source that
he uses to make his

281
00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:33.650
life easier. And rather than
making it snippets, he's made

282
00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:36.710
it a formal library and
then gone on and created

283
00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:41.210
two really successful open source
applications using that underlying library.

284
00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:43.210
Wow. That's great. You know,
you could really become a

285
00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:46.150
better cook Or reading other
people's code. Yeah. You know,

286
00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:47.920
you don't become a better
coder writing. You know, if

287
00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:49.810
some, if you're in an
English literature class, they don't

288
00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:51.940
say you really should write
more. You'll become a better

289
00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:54.780
writer. Yeah. Although there is
truth to that, but there

290
00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:56.620
you have to read a
lot, lot more than you.

291
00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:00.340
Right? Totally. So I was
really happy to see that

292
00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:02.710
out there and he's doing
a great thing to make

293
00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:05.140
it available. And I'm looking
forward to reading, reading that

294
00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:07.720
code over the coming weeks.
Are you doing a webcast

295
00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:10.900
coming up here soon about
hardware? Something? Yeah. Actually speaking

296
00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:13.420
of source code, I've got
all of those, all the

297
00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:15.790
different source and things that
I've written for the I'm

298
00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:19.780
coding for fun site at
msn.com/coding for fun. I'm going

299
00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:24.550
to be doing a webcast,
talking about programming hardware with,

300
00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:29.440
with dotnet 2.0, that's up
at shrinker.com/e I T. Now

301
00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:32.590
what do you mean hardware?
So this is basically anything

302
00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:36.550
that's a physical object, separate
free from your computer. So

303
00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:38.680
that might, well actually on
the webcast, we'll be talking

304
00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:42.160
about talking to a GPS
with serial ports. Okay. I'll

305
00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:44.830
be talking about those key
fobs, the security key fobs

306
00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:47.530
that are USB based and
talk about the hell that

307
00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:51.100
is USB. Yes. We'll talk
about, I'm talking to that.

308
00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:55.300
Webcam, the baby webcam using
a HTTP. Alright. You know,

309
00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:57.310
it's really great. If an
object that you're trying to

310
00:16:57.310 --> 00:16:59.920
interface with has an IP
address. That's the ultimate for

311
00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:01.900
hardware. Yep. I can just
talk to it. And it's

312
00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:04.030
got its own web server,
but not every piece of

313
00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:05.350
hardware is like that. So
we're going to talk about

314
00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:07.210
all those things. Getting use
sockets for any of this.

315
00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:10.300
I'm probably not raw sockets,
but I will be manually

316
00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:14.530
parsing HTTP and looking at
JPEG files that are coming

317
00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:18.220
across in what's called an
JPEG or motion JPEG. Cool.

318
00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:20.830
And that won't be sockets,
but will be pretty low

319
00:17:20.830 --> 00:17:24.250
level. Pretty close. Yep. Yeah.
A couple other things that

320
00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:28.570
are going on right now
is a David JAKKS MVP

321
00:17:28.570 --> 00:17:32.440
hacks book is coming out
just in time for just

322
00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.960
not for tech ed. Yeah.
You can get details on

323
00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:37.810
that at shrinks, your.com/e J
four. And this was going

324
00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:39.220
to be a little bit
different kind of a book.

325
00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:42.730
It's not like the asp.net
two old professional book. This

326
00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:47.650
was just a book of
collected hacks, undocumented things, tips,

327
00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:50.910
tricks, things that will allow
you to mess around with

328
00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:53.970
ASP. And it'll actually be
most of the hacks work

329
00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:57.270
in asp.net. One, one and
two. Oh, and I did

330
00:17:57.270 --> 00:18:00.180
the HTTP handler section, the
view state section some stuff

331
00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:03.540
on HTTP modules pulled in
content from all over Phil

332
00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:06.660
hacks blog, a number of
different places. One of the

333
00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:10.140
neat things is a little
HTTP handler based on an

334
00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:14.100
Edward Tufty thing called spark
lines, spark lines. You can

335
00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:20.130
learn about those at a
shrinker.com/ega. Five are little tiny

336
00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:23.790
graphics that are like the
sizes of words, the size

337
00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:27.840
of words that are meant
to provide a burst of

338
00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:31.200
information and used almost like
a noun. So someone would

339
00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:35.040
say your blood sugar is,
and they would, and then

340
00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:36.900
you'd see a graphic appear
as if it were a

341
00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:39.180
word. And it would be
a tiny little line graph.

342
00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:42.060
And by just looking at
that line graph, you could

343
00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:46.920
tell a picture's worth a
thousand words, right? So this

344
00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:51.960
HTTP handler written by Eric
Bach tall is@shrinkstir.com slash EGA

345
00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:57.840
six is a totally a
kind of extensible C-sharp HTP

346
00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:00.030
handler that can be used
in any application that doesn't

347
00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:04.380
care about what kind of
a application you're using because

348
00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:07.170
the interface is query string
based. You actually describe the

349
00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:10.920
graph over the query string,
using whatever numbers you want

350
00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:15.330
and he'll automatically return and
generated graphic. You can do

351
00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:18.480
bar charts. You can do
that's cool. Smooth is all

352
00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:20.850
based on the course, you
can do smooth lines. And

353
00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:23.790
then we've put that into
the book with his permission

354
00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:29.070
and using that tough desk
way of thinking. You could

355
00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:32.700
take that and provide, you
know, ongoing balances information on

356
00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:36.960
a financial site, blood sugar
information visitors on your site.

357
00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:39.150
I mean the, the, the,
the benefits of having a

358
00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:42.870
tiny, tiny line graph within
a sentence available to you

359
00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:46.670
on your site. Very nice.
Very cool. I go rambling

360
00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:49.490
again. You know, one thing
you didn't say about the

361
00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:51.830
ASP net MVP hacks book
is that you're one of

362
00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:54.680
the authors, right? I agree.
I did imply that you're

363
00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:56.990
right. There are a number
of smarter authors than I

364
00:19:56.990 --> 00:20:01.910
on the book. If you
look@thecoverofthebookupatshrinks.com slash <inaudible>, I was

365
00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:04.070
joking earlier that that looks
like a bunch of guys

366
00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:05.960
with them. 12 set of
dice that are about ready

367
00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:08.930
to a place in D
and D a bunch of

368
00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:10.900
nerdy, bunch of nerdy looking
guys on our Brady bunch

369
00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:15.860
cover there. But you know,
we've got Jonathan Goodyear, you

370
00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:19.160
know, the angry coder there,
right? J Ambrose. I mean,

371
00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:21.770
these are some smart guys,
Joe Maio, who did a

372
00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:24.020
S a C sharp book
recently for the same author

373
00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:27.140
as the, a PowerShell in
action. So David Jack has

374
00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:30.110
really got a bunch of
smart folks together. And I

375
00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:32.600
guess they're doing a deal
up on Amazon now that

376
00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:35.360
you can buy that book
along with the asp.net book

377
00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:36.920
for the price of one.
So it's going to two

378
00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:39.620
for deals On Amazon, right?
It's a good book. I've

379
00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:42.050
read it. They had the
professional ESPN at two Oh

380
00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:45.380
one. No, your, your ASP
net MVP hacks book, you

381
00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:47.800
go, Oh, you were one
of the reviewers. Yeah. Oh,

382
00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:50.010
rock on. Yup. I didn't
know that you were sneaking

383
00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:52.590
around in the back, looking
The proofs brother. See, you

384
00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:54.450
don't even know. See. Yeah.
Yeah. I, you know, and

385
00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:55.710
if I had known you
were reading, I would have

386
00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:59.730
left messages for you in
the comments, a couple other

387
00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:03.990
things I'm going to be
running around next week. Speaking

388
00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:06.360
at a couple of places
as part of my Neta

389
00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:12.330
obligations, stringer.com/ega seven. I'll be
in Pittsburgh on Tuesday, North

390
00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:15.720
Dallas on Wednesday in Dallas,
on Thursday, all the while

391
00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:18.210
holding down my full time
job logging in over the,

392
00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:20.340
the cell phone modem, they
were trying to get real

393
00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:23.250
work done. Yup. And that
speaker schedule, like I said,

394
00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:27.090
is up there@shrinksor.com slash EGA
seven. And then at tech

395
00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:30.030
ed, I'm going to be
part of the group of

396
00:21:30.030 --> 00:21:34.170
judges for the iron architect
contests and the iron architect

397
00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:39.060
contest up@shrinksor.com slash E eight
is pretty interesting because if

398
00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:43.320
you, even though the site's
a little dense with its

399
00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:47.310
amount of information, if you
look into the details, they're

400
00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:52.140
giving away a free chance
at the Microsoft architect certification.

401
00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:54.960
And this is the super
certification, right? This isn't like

402
00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:58.530
MCC or MCFC. This is
like the $10,000 one They're

403
00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:01.050
giving away something worth 10
grand. Basically you sit in

404
00:22:01.050 --> 00:22:04.950
front of a board and
go through a whole process.

405
00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:07.980
This is a multi-month, you
know, six months, nine months

406
00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:09.770
process. You have to go
through. It's like getting your,

407
00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:13.080
getting your ms right, getting
your master's in, something like

408
00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:16.170
that. And they've got the
iron architect question up there,

409
00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:18.690
and they're going to be
judged by a bunch of

410
00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:22.680
a competent NBA MVPs. And
you could potentially win something

411
00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:25.050
worth 10 grand Pain. As
long as we're talking about

412
00:22:25.050 --> 00:22:27.810
appearances, I'm doing something. I
don't think anyone has done

413
00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:31.420
before. I'm doing, I'm making
a remote appearance at a

414
00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:33.810
code camper, a grok talk.
They're calling it. It's not

415
00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:37.500
really code camp. It's the
Anarbor GrokTalk and it's today,

416
00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:40.710
Wednesday, it's the day that
this show is coming out.

417
00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:45.270
I'll be doing it tonight.
And we're basically setting up

418
00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:48.450
a computer I'm remoting in.
I've got a telephone interface

419
00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:52.590
and I'm doing a remote,
a demo from my office

420
00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:55.590
in new London to a
crowd at this, at this

421
00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:58.080
group. And if it works,
you know, maybe we'll try

422
00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:01.080
to enable this technology for,
for other people who want

423
00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:02.880
to do remote presentation. Yeah.
I don't think I've ever

424
00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:04.830
seen that before. It's such
an obvious thing to do,

425
00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:07.080
but I think you're, I've
never seen anyone give a

426
00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:08.520
talk. Are they going to
put you on the screen

427
00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:10.200
with a camera? No, no,
no. You won't see me

428
00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:12.300
on the screen, but you'll
see my machine. And they're

429
00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:14.190
going to, you're going to
share your entire screen out

430
00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:16.320
to the share mine Entire
screen. And we have two

431
00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:18.990
way communication between the crowd
and me. That's how the

432
00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:22.020
phone that's hot. Yep. Try
that. That would get me

433
00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:24.630
off of an airplane. Yeah,
exactly. That's the whole idea

434
00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:25.950
is that, you know, I'm
going to talk to my

435
00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:28.440
Netta about this and maybe,
you know, making some formal

436
00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:30.600
process by which we can
get the equipment out to

437
00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:32.610
the user groups and get
them some training. What a

438
00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:35.040
great idea. Yep. It's the
same stuff that we use

439
00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:38.610
for a DNR TV and.net
rocks, telephone interface, kind of

440
00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:42.360
stuff with some microphones and
some audio wizardry on their

441
00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:46.130
end, very slick. And also
Richard and I are doing

442
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:50.000
a.net rocks live at tech
ed in Boston. And we're

443
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.340
going to be interviewing. We
think we're going to be

444
00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:55.190
interviewing the <inaudible> team, although
they haven't committed yet, but

445
00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:58.940
that's the, they have a
initial gee. That sounds cool.

446
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.740
And we're going to be
raffling off at that show,

447
00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:11.000
a MSDN premium subscription, MSDN
premium subscription. We're going to

448
00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.980
be giving one of those
away. Now, as you know,

449
00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:16.130
this is something that Microsoft
just doesn't give away very

450
00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:20.510
often, but we as regional
directors and MVPs too, as

451
00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:24.020
well, get to give a
few of these away to

452
00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:27.170
key customers. And we decided
to use one. I decided

453
00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:30.050
to use one of mine
at this tech ed session.

454
00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:32.540
Very cool. All right, Scott.
And that brings us to

455
00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:36.710
the end of another fabulous
episode of Hansel minutes. Thanks

456
00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:39.860
for listening, Scott. Thanks for
sharing. And we'll see you

457
00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:49.450
next week. <inaudible>.
