Scott Hanselman. This is another

12
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.000
episode of Hansel minutes today.
I'm talking with Matthew conlon.

13
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.000
He's a PhD student interested
in how computers can help

14
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
people communicate complex information more
effectively and the editor-in-chief of

15
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.700
parametric press how are you
sir? I'm great Scott. Thanks

16
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.400
so much for having me.
It is absolutely my pleasure.

17
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.800
I've been trying to get
you on the show for

18
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.000
a while because I I
stumbled upon you on the

19
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.800
internet, you know every Today
we see interesting stuff and

20
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.900
there's lots of interesting people
but every once in a

21
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.500
while you find it interesting
person that you then you

22
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.800
kind of start following around
like I was seeing. Oh,

23
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.900
wow, he worked on this
and then he worked on

24
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.900
that and oh that's interesting.
I get to know who

25
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.600
this this Matthew Conlan is
and the first time I

26
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.400
heard of the work that
you were working on was

27
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:40.000
at this this parametric, press
its parametric dot, press kudos

28
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.100
for the top level domain
there. Thank you unraveling the

29
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.400
Article that kind of went
low-key viral, I think it

30
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.300
was on Hacker News for
a while, but it was

31
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.100
just everywhere. Everyone was talking
about this article that Omar

32
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.000
shahada did called unraveling the
jpeg hosted on your on

33
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.100
your site. What is it
that the capture the imagination

34
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.100
of the internet with this
article? Yeah. So this article

35
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.400
walks readers through the technology
that makes jpegs possible on

36
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.800
the internet. So I think
one thing with the article

37
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.900
is that you know, it's
covering a topic that everyone

38
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.800
who uses computers or the
internet is familiar with which

39
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.100
is jpeg images and how
they can let us send

40
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.200
pictures to one another but
the way that Omar presented

41
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.300
the information was kind of
really special and really interesting.

42
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.900
So rather than just talking
about the technology and showing

43
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.500
kind of static diagrams and
equations. He built these interactive

44
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.900
diagrams that would allow readers
to actually manipulate the bits

45
00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.500
that make up the image
and see how changing different

46
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.400
pieces of information actually affect
how the image is encoded

47
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.900
and how it appears on
the screen. So that's something

48
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.400
that You know, the internet
is a great medium to

49
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.400
be able to create interactive
things like this and it

50
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.200
doesn't happen. So often that
you get someone who's so

51
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.000
knowledgeable and passionate as Omar
who's able to create something

52
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.600
like that and share it
with so many people indeed

53
00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.500
when I first arrived at
this page as we all

54
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.100
have a half-dozen long-form articles
that we're we promised ourselves

55
00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.400
that will read that the
come at us all year

56
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.100
all year long every day.
I thought oh, this is

57
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.700
like a medium a medium
post and by medium, I

58
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.800
mean nice typography. Clean use
of white space but it's

59
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.300
got dramatic use of typography
including some verticals and some

60
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.200
interesting fonts and it immediately
presents itself. And you go

61
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.100
in a second. This is
not what you typically see

62
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.300
in the internet and things
that I thought were images

63
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.000
were not and good use
of CSS and I started

64
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.300
to wonder what's going on
here and then you start

65
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.200
scrolling down and there's a
picture of a cat which

66
00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.200
we've seen before and then
there's some some bits and

67
00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.100
you're encouraged to manipulate the
bits. And then the the

68
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.400
jpeg is encoded and decoded
like live. I thought I

69
00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.800
was going to like hurt
my machine or corrupted or

70
00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.300
something. Like I was going
to like changing one bite

71
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.600
in a JPEG was going
to ruin things but it

72
00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.000
didn't really ruin it. Yeah,
so that's a challenge with

73
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
something like this is how
do you make it so

74
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.700
that the interactions are accessible
for people in the so

75
00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.300
that they're not, you know
scared to mess anything up

76
00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.800
and we tried really hard
to think about different ways

77
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.300
of how to do that.
But, you know providing kind

78
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.000
of Good error messages and
feedback. If you do corrupt

79
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.900
the image quote-unquote corrupt and
there's a very clear reset

80
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.800
button that can always take
you right back to the

81
00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.400
start. But we also added
links in line with the

82
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.500
text. So if you click
on particular sections of the

83
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:34.100
text Omar suggest these particular
configurations of the bits that

84
00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.800
you can just click on
and it will set itself

85
00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.300
in that configuration. You can
kind of learn okay. Here's

86
00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.900
you know, just changing this
one number. Here's what happens

87
00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.000
and you get this interesting
output now, maybe I'll try

88
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.800
something - Often see what
do these other configurations do

89
00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.100
there was so much about
this article in this level

90
00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.600
of interactivity that worked and
I think that that point

91
00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.800
that you just made that
it's one thing to have

92
00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.000
some pros and then have
a bitter a bit of

93
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.900
interactivity and then have some
pros but he literally in

94
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.500
the middle of a sentence
says, you know, it's interesting

95
00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.900
that changing. Some numbers doesn't
impact the image while link

96
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.700
setting at this number 217
online one ruins the image

97
00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.200
and then you click on
it and then it does

98
00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.600
exactly See what it says
it was going to do

99
00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.800
you build interactivity between the
pros and the the island

100
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.300
of of interactivity. Exactly. And
that's something that I think

101
00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.700
can be really powerful is
tying text to the actual

102
00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.500
graphics on the page and
it's something unfortunately. We don't

103
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.700
see too often because you
think about how would you

104
00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.300
do that in a site
built on WordPress or medium?

105
00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.900
For example, it just may
not be possible. Unless you're

106
00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.900
really diving into the low-level
under underlying HTML and JavaScript

107
00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.100
which brings me to a
really interesting question not to

108
00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.100
like You know impugn the
entire internet here because we

109
00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:49.900
all appreciate I don't necessarily
appreciate medium, but I appreciate

110
00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:53.300
the idea of free and
easy publishing and I appreciate

111
00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.200
that WordPress has become the
operating system that the internet

112
00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.300
seems to run on. But
you know, I grew up

113
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.900
on you know, Gio cities
and live journal and things

114
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.100
like that where we were
hacking in my space by

115
00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.500
just editing the HTML now
we want to be able

116
00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.800
to just slap the keyboard
and make things work. These

117
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.000
web sites like WordPress and
medium have really kept Us

118
00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:17.400
from making articles like what
you have a parametric press

119
00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.700
it's prevented us from creating
this level of interactivity. Absolutely.

120
00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.100
I mean, I think you
take the good with the

121
00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:27.000
bad because you know WordPress
and other blogging platforms really

122
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.900
they do give people a
voice to publish to a

123
00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:32.200
large audience that they wouldn't
have otherwise, but kind of

124
00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.800
the their these golden handcuffs
in a way as well

125
00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:39.100
because right you're not getting
able to manipulate the underlying

126
00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:41.500
code or add the custom
design that you want to

127
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.600
so we think of parametric
Press is kind of pushing

128
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.700
back against that and so
the whole issue of the

129
00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:50.500
parametric press is open source.
So we're kind of trying

130
00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:53.400
to provide not only a
really great publication but also

131
00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.500
kind of a model for
other people to follow as

132
00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:00.700
well. Why do you think
that 10 20 years ago?

133
00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:04.500
We were promised an interactive
internet and by that, I

134
00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:08.800
mean not just books copied
in there static Pros to

135
00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.300
the internet, but I seem
to remember in the early

136
00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.400
days with things like Java.
Let's we were promised an

137
00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.400
interactive internet and they just
all stopped one day. I

138
00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.700
think it goes back even
even further than that. So

139
00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:22.900
one of my big Inspirations
for this project is Alan

140
00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:27.300
Kay and his dynabook, but
I don't know. I mean

141
00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.500
they're I don't think there's
any easy answer for one.

142
00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:33.400
I think that publishing interactive
content like this is is

143
00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.700
really hard. I mean it
took a team of people

144
00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:40.000
with sort of different backgrounds
like designers writers as programmers

145
00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:43.200
editors all coming together to
be able to make this

146
00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:48.600
happen. And but also if
you think about just the

147
00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:51.800
the funding model of the
internet and how publishing works.

148
00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:57.000
It's not always in Publishers
best interest to spend so

149
00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.200
much time creating the content
like this. And if you

150
00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.800
have a new medium like
the internet where people don't

151
00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:06.300
really know what the possibilities
are. Maybe the audience isn't

152
00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:09.600
asking for quite as much
because they don't even know

153
00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.600
that it's possible then idea
that people don't know what's

154
00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.900
possible is interesting. Because it's
been so long since the

155
00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:19.300
internet was like this. It's
been many many years where

156
00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:22.000
it became a largely static
thing and I do realize

157
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.600
that I'm making some broad
generalizations here that there's a

158
00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:31.200
whole generation of people who
are surprised when someone utilizes,

159
00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.400
you know, scrolling in an
unusual way to do an

160
00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:36.100
infinite scroll or horizontal scroll
or when the New York

161
00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:38.800
Times or 538 does a
visualization and someone goes oh

162
00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:40.600
my goodness. How did that
pop out of that do

163
00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:44.800
that? So it's become the
The exception rather than the

164
00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:48.200
rule right? I mean so
I grew up in the

165
00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.900
generation. So my first social
network that I was on

166
00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:54.100
was my space and I
really love that just to

167
00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:57.600
be able to customize the
design of my page for

168
00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.400
example, and then I remember
moving to Facebook and you

169
00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.800
can do any of that
which which felt really frustrating

170
00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.200
even though the design was
clean and all my friends

171
00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:08.500
were on it. Right but
I kind of have always

172
00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:11.100
felt like there were these
two internet's existing at the

173
00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:13.400
same time. Like there was
the internet of the big

174
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:16.400
Usher's so there's the New
York Times and CNN websites

175
00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.200
and things like this, but
then there's also this other

176
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.900
internet where people are just
having fun and making their

177
00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:25.300
own web pages and making
their own content. And so

178
00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.500
I've always kind of identified
with that that second group

179
00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:31.500
but I don't think that
it has to remain so

180
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
small and uh, I think
that as publishing tools become

181
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.300
more powerful. Hopefully we can
bring some of these ideas

182
00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:42.900
to more of the mainstream.
Sometimes people point to Star

183
00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:46.000
Trek. As the time when
we thought that interactive graphics

184
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.800
and interactive movement and things
like quote-unquote iPad would be

185
00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:54.000
would would be we're conceived
of but you point to

186
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.100
Alan Kay who developed the
dynabook in the late 60s

187
00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:01.200
early 70s when he was
doing his Ph.D. As being

188
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:04.800
your inspiration. Did you think
about the Star Trek or

189
00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.500
iPads and things like that?
And while you were doing

190
00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:10.700
this work, so I didn't
think about Star Trek one

191
00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:14.900
thing that I did think
about was the The Illustrated

192
00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:19.100
primer, I know that from
I think it's Neal Stephenson's

193
00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:22.700
book that I forget the
exact title. It's the ladies

194
00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:25.400
the ladies guide the young
lady's Illustrated primer guide where

195
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.300
she's given this book which
is kind of this interactive

196
00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:33.200
tutoring system and the book
is kind of an artificial

197
00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:36.100
intelligence and it learns with
you and it can modify

198
00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:38.000
what it's telling you based
on how you doing and

199
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.300
based on what your interests
are. And so that was

200
00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:43.300
something that was really eye-opening
to me when I first

201
00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:45.800
That because it was I
think that book was written

202
00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:50.100
in the early 90s and
it's something that's like, oh,

203
00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:52.600
yeah, we should definitely have
this. Why don't we and

204
00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:54.400
why isn't there anybody that
I can that I can

205
00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.600
find who's even like working
on this or talking about

206
00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:59.500
this? Hmm. Yeah, that book
is the diamond age young

207
00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:02.900
ladies Illustrated primer by Neal
Stephenson part of a his

208
00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:08.000
kind of post cyberpunk style
of writing it do these

209
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
all of these things whether
it be dynabook or the

210
00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.300
Apple Newton or I think
about hypercard Guard we're all

211
00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:18.900
a promise of the easy
interactivity and the and then

212
00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:21.600
the during the rise of
JavaScript in the last few

213
00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:25.700
years as well as early
days with Java applets. It

214
00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:29.400
seemed like the barrier to
entry to create an interactive

215
00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:33.500
visualization kind of got higher
and higher to like only

216
00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:36.400
programmers could do such a
thing not not Publishers or

217
00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.500
not people who want to
just simply present information and

218
00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:41.400
interactive way. Yeah. I think
that's true. And I think

219
00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:44.300
we're seeing that some with
web development. In general like

220
00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:46.700
if you look at discussions
that are happening for example

221
00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:49.800
in the react Community right
now with like, you know,

222
00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:52.800
there's these really really powerful
tools and build systems, like

223
00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:57.200
react that allow you to
make web applications that are

224
00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:01.100
you know, well engineered and
well-structured but the cost that

225
00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:03.700
you have for that is
that a beginner coming into

226
00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:06.300
these things so just can't
wrap their head around why

227
00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:09.300
they're all necessary, right? And
even if you you know

228
00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.400
that at the end of
the day, it's just HTML

229
00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:12.900
and JavaScript. So why do
we need all of these

230
00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:16.900
other things? Things I think
there's maybe something similar in

231
00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:20.500
the area of data visualization.
I mean, I think that

232
00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:24.100
D3 has and Mike Bostock
have really done a great

233
00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:28.100
job in terms of making
that accessible to more people.

234
00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:30.500
I mean, it's just the
sheer number of examples and

235
00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:32.400
open source code that he's
posted on the internet I

236
00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:35.700
think has been a huge
inspiration and been to that

237
00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:38.900
Community for sure. Yeah. Definitely.
I was going to bring

238
00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:43.300
up Mike Bostock his kind
of seminal article on up.

239
00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:45.700
Our way to code bringing
the idea of like a

240
00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:50.200
jupyter notebook to integrated discovery
of data. He has a

241
00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:53.100
great quote in there called
a / Ben shneiderman that

242
00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:57.200
says the purpose of visualization
is in sight not pictures

243
00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:00.800
and interactivity as a dimension
to pictures that allows you

244
00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:03.700
to get that Insight. I
think I think that's right.

245
00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.900
It's this whole other dimension
that maybe we haven't thought

246
00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:10.200
about before when we're focused
more on kind of just

247
00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:13.400
the graphic design of visualizations
and thinking about how oh,

248
00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:16.300
they're laid out on the
page as a designer when

249
00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:18.400
you realize that there's this
whole other tool that you

250
00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:24.100
have which is motion and
responsiveness. There are tons of

251
00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:29.300
interesting capabilities that open up
Sick of waiting for your

252
00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:32.300
CI test to pass or
having to manage different CI

253
00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:35.800

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:53.000
your infrastructure. There's great documentation
a clean web UI and

259
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.900
plug-ins for different types of
tools visit build kite. That's

260
00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:02.500
ee.com Hanselman for a 14-day
free trial and see how

261
00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:07.100
shopify's scaled from 300 to
1500 Engineers while keeping their

262
00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:13.700
build times under five minutes.
Let's build kite.com Hanselman. How

263
00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:16.100
did this work? You have
you are the Editor in

264
00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:18.900
Chief of parametric, press do
you go looking for someone

265
00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:22.400
like Omar and then you
work together cooperatively or do

266
00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:24.500
you did he come to
you? How do you how

267
00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:28.800
did that happen? Yeah, so
parametric press Started just as

268
00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.800
an idea that I had
and I kind of recruited

269
00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:33.200
a few friends of mine
to work on it. So

270
00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:37.100
another editor that was on
board for this issue is

271
00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:40.900
Fred Homan who's a PhD
student at Georgia Tech and

272
00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.300
our collaborators terrorist Allah who
is one of the editors

273
00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:49.200
in terms of the text.
We wrote out a call

274
00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:54.900
for proposals and we sort
of built up this idea

275
00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:57.200
by just like writing out.
Okay, here's what we want

276
00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:59.400
the thing to look like
and we sent it to

277
00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:01.400
all of our friends and
they gave us feedback and

278
00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.200
we kind of refine it
and refine it until we

279
00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:06.200
had something that like really
captured the idea. We were

280
00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:10.100
trying to get at at
that point. We sent it

281
00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:13.900
to Andrew old one who's
the CTO of O'Reilly and

282
00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:17.500
he gave us a little
bit of money to create

283
00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:20.300
the first issue. So thanks
a lot Andrew for making

284
00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:23.600
that happen at O'Reilly media
and once we had that

285
00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:27.200
Should we put out this
call for proposals online? We

286
00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:32.000
said hey, if you're an
author who's interested in this

287
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.800
kind of new way of
Storytelling that utilizes visualization and

288
00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:40.000
interactive Graphics send in your
proposal just an idea a

289
00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.400
short paragraph and we have
some funds to pay you

290
00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:47.300
and we have some people
on board who are experts

291
00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:50.000
at the visualization side of
things who can help out

292
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.400
on the programming side of
things. So we wanted to

293
00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:55.100
make sure that people who
hadn't necessarily worked on this

294
00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:58.700
style of content before wouldn't
be scared off by trying

295
00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:01.200
to take it on and
that was successful and we

296
00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:06.900
got I think about 35
submissions for ultimately five spots.

297
00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:10.000
And so it was very
competitive for the first round.

298
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.600
I think it sounds like
it couldn't have gone better

299
00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:14.000
to you. Hit it out
of the park on the

300
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.300
first try there. Well, thank
you. Now I was looking

301
00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:19.800
at this and the first
thing I did of course

302
00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:22.600
is a programmers. I wouldn't
view Source I start to

303
00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:24.400
figure out like oh, this
is Using how did how

304
00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:28.200
did this happen? I want
to understand was this an

305
00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:32.800
app like was each page
was each article and app

306
00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:34.800
but it appears that it's
more than that. This is

307
00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.800
some kind of a document
is part of a larger

308
00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:39.800
larger way of thinking about
how to visualize things as

309
00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:43.000
part of a toolkit. That's
right. So the whole issue

310
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.200
is built on this open
source project called idle, which

311
00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:49.900
is an interactive publishing system
that I've been working on

312
00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:51.700
for the past couple of
years as part of my

313
00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:55.800
PhD research at the University
of Washington. Washington's and one

314
00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:59.800
of the so what we
wanted to do is, you

315
00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:03.900
know test out this system
in a real a real

316
00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:05.700
world setting so we wanted
to say okay we're going

317
00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:07.700
to do this live. We're
going to make the best

318
00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:11.400
possible article issue that we
can and we're also going

319
00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:15.500
to use that to understand
what are the failure points

320
00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:18.200
of the system what needs
Improvement and so on so

321
00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:22.300
that we can sort of
in typical open source fashion

322
00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:27.100
continue improving Everything in the
open and so this was

323
00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.200
one thing about the parametric
press was that it was

324
00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:33.800
the first kind of multi
page magazine that was built

325
00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:38.100
on the tool. So previously
we had seen people creating,

326
00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:41.600
you know, single page what
you would call explorable explanations

327
00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:45.000
or interactive essays using it,
but never anything that kind

328
00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.100
of had its own style
and design and it was

329
00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:51.800
very cohesive across multiple Pages.
I'm looking up at idle

330
00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:54.000
and I'm going to make
sure that I include Links

331
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.500
to all of this in
the show notes, of course,

332
00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:59.100
it spilled ID yll and
in the gallery, there is

333
00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:02.200
an example that I think
is particularly interesting when it

334
00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:04.900
shows you the difference between
where's the pros? Where's the

335
00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:09.200
visualization? And where's the componentry?
Because it really showcases the

336
00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:11.800
idea that this isn't meant
for one person necessarily but

337
00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:15.500
perhaps a way to reduce
the amount of code required

338
00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:18.400
for collaboration between the researcher
or a journalist in a

339
00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:21.400
programmer and the example I'm
thinking of is this card

340
00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:25.700
shuffling example, which is basically
Explaining, you know when you

341
00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:28.100
shuffle a card, how does
it really behave is there

342
00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:31.100
what we think is intuitive
is not necessarily how it

343
00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:33.700
works. If you go look
at the code on GitHub,

344
00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:36.500
there is some there's some
react you can use D3

345
00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:38.900
so like you can get
to the low level but

346
00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:42.200
if you look at the
pros within the pros written

347
00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:44.800
in this Idol markup language,
it looks kind of more

348
00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:49.200
like mark down with some
meaning than it does code.

349
00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:51.800
I don't even see any
any JavaScript you kept a

350
00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:57.600
nice separation. Of responsibilities. Thank
you. Yeah, that's I'm glad

351
00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:59.200
you pointed that out because
that was actually one of

352
00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:03.000
the big motivations for this
project was thinking about you

353
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.100
know, how do you enable
collaboration between people with different

354
00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:11.000
skills, whether they're writers are
technical people who are more

355
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.700
on the programming side or
designers who are interested in

356
00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:17.000
making things look good and
feel nice. And so this

357
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000
understanding that there needs to
be both a separation of

358
00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.500
concerns, but the ability for
people to Collaborate kind of

359
00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:26.000
came out of a lot
of the work that I

360
00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:29.500
did when I was at
5:38. I was on the

361
00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:33.700
graphics desk there and so
I understood kind of how

362
00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:37.900
a newsroom Works in that
sense that there are people

363
00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:40.800
who have these really specialized
skills and they have to

364
00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:45.300
all work together and when
you're publishing it interactive content,

365
00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:49.700
a lot of the tools
don't acknowledge that there's there's

366
00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:52.700
tools that really help out
one party or the other

367
00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:54.400
but then when you actually
Actually have to put the

368
00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:58.200
two together. It's a real
struggle. And so you'll have

369
00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:03.300
for example maybe a an
HTML page with something that

370
00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:06.100
a writer wrote put in
has a has a typo

371
00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:08.600
in it. Then how does
an editor go and fix

372
00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:10.400
that do they go on
get Hub and like change

373
00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:12.400
this one thing do they
have do they have to

374
00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:15.200
understand get just in order
to add a comma to

375
00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:18.900
to the article that seems
like something that is shouldn't

376
00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:22.300
be necessary. Right? And so
with idle the idea is

377
00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:24.800
that there's this Mark Up
which contains all of the

378
00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:28.600
text and there's the code
which has the kind of

379
00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:31.500
Snippets of D3 or react
or whatever and those are

380
00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:34.900
separate but they're tied together
through these I guess you

381
00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:37.900
would call them includes or
component markup lives in the

382
00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:42.200
idol file. So you can
kind of orchestrate where things

383
00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:45.800
appear and how they look
and what happens when someone

384
00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:47.900
reaches a certain section on
the page or when someone

385
00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:49.800
clicks on something that's all
done in the mark-up, but

386
00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:54.100
the actual implementation details of
the graphics themselves or Separate.

387
00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:56.900
Yeah, one of the things
that was particularly clever about

388
00:20:56.900 --> 00:21:01.500
Fred holmen's cards shuffling example
was that there certainly like

389
00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:03.600
a bunch of pros and
then there's an interactive thing

390
00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:05.800
with cards running around on
the page, but in the

391
00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:10.800
middle of sentences in line
referring to the cards and

392
00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:14.300
Suits it'll say something like
once the King of Diamonds

393
00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:18.100
moves up one position. He's
chosen rather than to spell

394
00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:22.100
out King of Diamonds. He
literally has a red k

395
00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:25.400
and a diamond Cleanly as
if it's as if it

396
00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:29.200
were a glyph that the
browser itself knew about and

397
00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:30.700
I thought to myself I'll
hang on a second. There's

398
00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:34.200
no there's no King of
Diamonds glyph that is like

399
00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:36.400
a Unicode thing. How did
he do that? There's a

400
00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:41.100
component within the code. That's
a react component that literally

401
00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:44.600
exists to visualize a card.
It's only like 16 lines.

402
00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:48.400
If you pull out white
space and curly braces and

403
00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:51.600
it takes care of saying
that so the the author

404
00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:54.300
just says just like they
would with An equation with

405
00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:58.800
like mathml they say I
want a visualization that represents

406
00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:03.500
an inline card and suit,
it's extremely clean and very

407
00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:06.200
very clever. Thanks. Yeah, I
think there's something to be

408
00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:09.200
said to be able to
kind of write things declaratively

409
00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:11.400
like this where you know,
you can really just say

410
00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:14.300
I want this card representation
here. I'm not going to

411
00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:17.000
worry about you know, how
the component is implemented and

412
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.200
that's something separate. But yeah,
so I think Fred did

413
00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:23.200
a great job utilizing the
the toolkit there and making

414
00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:26.000
it A nice article out
of it. So is this

415
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.500
something that like a New
York Times or 538 or

416
00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:31.200
one of the big visualisations
shops that everyone is impressed

417
00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.100
with would do or they
doing a lot of there

418
00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:38.500
things with D3 dot J's,
manually. Yeah. So most of

419
00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:42.300
the big media Outlets today
have invested a lot in

420
00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:46.400
infrastructure that you know, it
doesn't look exactly like Idol

421
00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:49.400
but has a lot of
the same ideas behind it,

422
00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:54.200
which is kind of combining
text and Pros. And code

423
00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:56.900
in this way. So I
wouldn't expect that. They would

424
00:22:56.900 --> 00:23:00.900
necessarily adopt this project in
the short term. I think

425
00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:03.600
that where I would expect
it to have a bigger

426
00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:07.200
impact is at smaller media
Outlets that actually don't have

427
00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:09.300
the technical capacity to build
this kind of thing on

428
00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:12.400
their own so I don't
they can say okay, here's

429
00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:16.300
you know, here's this project
that allows us to publish

430
00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:19.100
interactive articles in a well
structured way that has a

431
00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:21.300
lot of these design decisions.
Are you taking care of

432
00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:25.200
for us? So this could
be Integrated into someone else's

433
00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:28.100
existing publishing pipeline as well.
If they did use WordPress.

434
00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:29.400
I presume that there would
be a way that they

435
00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:32.200
could integrate this in without
having to have the entire

436
00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:37.100
sites publishing workflow move to
idle. That's right. Yeah, so

437
00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:38.800
it's designed so that you
can either kind of use

438
00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:41.800
it wholesale like use it
to publish everything and kind

439
00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:45.100
of turn it into a
CMS or do it in

440
00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:47.600
a sort of a more
piece male way where either

441
00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:52.400
you can embed idle Snippets
In Articles or just create

442
00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:55.400
single Idol. Articles and embed
those in your in your

443
00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:59.600
WordPress deployment or something. Hmm
many years ago and a

444
00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:01.200
little bit still now. I
was a big fan of

445
00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:03.700
Edward tufte and everything that
he had written and I

446
00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:06.400
think a lot of us
went to see tufty live

447
00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:09.900
and receive his books on,
you know, his books on

448
00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:13.500
the visual display of quantitative
information. A lot of those

449
00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:17.400
bits of ways does present
information is very static though.

450
00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:21.400
I think know that his
things were taught in school

451
00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:24.700
for print in newspapers and
things But where is the

452
00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:26.800
research and the work happening
right now for doing these

453
00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:30.400
kind of things interactively? Yeah,
so I think tufte is

454
00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:33.400
great. I mean I've learned
a ton from from his

455
00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:36.900
writing and it from his
books, but you're absolutely right

456
00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:42.300
that he's focused on print
design more than interaction. Right?

457
00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:48.400
And so there are a
few threads of research I

458
00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:52.900
think happening in this area
now if you look at

459
00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:57.800
the From the academic Community.
The IEEE Vis conference often

460
00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:02.600
has very rigorous academic research
that that looks at. How

461
00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:07.500
do you incorporate interaction into
data-driven storytelling in this way

462
00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:12.300
and going even even further
back? I think that interactivity

463
00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:15.800
has been incorporated into data
analytics systems for a while

464
00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:19.000
now looking at for example,
the work of Ben shneiderman

465
00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.300
who I think you mentioned
briefly before but it's just

466
00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:27.600
more. Recently that we're thinking
about the combination of data

467
00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:31.200
and visualization and interactivity and
this more kind of Storytelling

468
00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:35.600
capacity. Hmm. When I tried
to show some of the

469
00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:39.100
things that are attractive parametric
press to my wife who

470
00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:43.000
is highly educated and has
more degrees than I do

471
00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:47.300
but is not a techie.
She wasn't sure what was

472
00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:50.000
going to be interactive and
wasn't what wasn't and I

473
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.400
tried to figure out why
that was what was it

474
00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:56.300
about? The web that has
taught her that most things

475
00:25:56.300 --> 00:26:01.600
on the web are flat
and static. You know, she

476
00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:04.400
I found it like for
example looking at your article

477
00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:07.400
on particle physics where you
do things like how to

478
00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:10.900
accelerate a particle using an
electric field and it's full

479
00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:14.400
of these interactive interfaces. Those
were not immediately intuitive to

480
00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:18.900
me and they are all
new in independent in a

481
00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:22.200
little interaction moments little applications
of they would have been

482
00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:25.400
Java applets 20 years. Go
how do you teach that

483
00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:29.100
to someone who's not intuitively
a techie to do that

484
00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:31.400
to try to interact with
that and feel comfortable with

485
00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:34.200
that, right? Yeah. I think
it's really interesting how we

486
00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:37.500
come to understand a medium
like the internet. So if

487
00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:41.000
you for example came across
this diagram in the context

488
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.400
of a video game, for
example, you would automatically assume

489
00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:46.800
that everything was interactive. Probably
right exactly. We've been conditioned

490
00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:51.000
to think that posts on
the internet are typically static

491
00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:54.100
and so there are You
know, there are a few

492
00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:57.800
ways that we can sort
of try to help through

493
00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:01.700
different design cues inform people
that there are these interactions

494
00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:05.500
that you can take. For
example, one thing that we

495
00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:07.300
did which may or may
not have been successful in

496
00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:10.500
the first article in Omar's
peace was to include an

497
00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:15.000
animated gif of someone interacting
with the widget before they

498
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.900
actually got to it. So
there's this this animation that

499
00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:20.700
includes a mouse pointer that
shows them highlighting text and

500
00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:22.700
manipulating it so that you
had a little cue that

501
00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:24.600
okay later. In the article,
you're going to get to

502
00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:28.600
be a be able to
do that yourself. I think

503
00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:34.300
that something that Nikki case
said which we can probably

504
00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:38.600
learn from is to make
everything bouncy. So if you

505
00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:41.000
think about if you have
something on your page that

506
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.900
can be clicked or can
be manipulated make it move

507
00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:46.700
a little bit just subtly
so that someone understands it.

508
00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:49.300
Okay. This is this is
something more than just a

509
00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:51.800
static element on the page.
That is a really great

510
00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:54.600
Point anytime that anything. Thing,
you know just a little

511
00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:56.900
shimmy is enough for you
to go and say oh

512
00:27:56.900 --> 00:28:00.100
that's a thing because you
know, we I was I

513
00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:03.100
was remember reading somewhere that
our brains are always looking

514
00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:06.500
in the peripheral vision for
threats. So things on the

515
00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:09.400
screen that wiggle cause the
some part of your brain

516
00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:12.200
to go what and there
is no squirrel and then

517
00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:13.700
you want to go and
mess with that and I

518
00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:17.400
read an article recently saying
that we also want constant

519
00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:20.400
feedback that things are going
well, so it recommended that

520
00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:23.000
we put a ripple effect
on all of our buttons

521
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.600
because So many people click
a button with their iPads

522
00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:27.600
or their touch screens and
they don't know if anything

523
00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:30.300
happened and then they end
up hitting the button twice

524
00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:33.500
as simple ripple effect tells
them that it did. In

525
00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:36.900
fact get clicked. Oh, yeah.
I mean, there's all sorts

526
00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:39.300
of little design cues that
can be incorporated to make

527
00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:42.000
sure that we're sending the
right message to users that

528
00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.700
there's something available to be
done. There's there's something happening

529
00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:49.900
in the background that you're
not just sitting and waiting

530
00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:51.400
for no reason and you
have to click the button

531
00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:55.600
again, so I Love those
those examples of kind of

532
00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:58.700
using psychology in a way
in an applied way to

533
00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:00.400
make sure that people are
getting the most out of

534
00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:03.400
your interfaces. Let me put
you on the spot as

535
00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:06.100
we get ready to close
here. What is your favorite

536
00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:08.600
visualization? What's an example that
of wanting to the you

537
00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:10.800
did or the one that
you saw where you just

538
00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:12.400
had to be like, oh
my goodness and you just

539
00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:15.300
rush pick your laptop off
and up and run down

540
00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:16.900
the hallway and say look
at this. Look how they

541
00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:20.400
did that. That was amazing.
There are many I think

542
00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:23.300
that a lot of the
work coming out of the

543
00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:27.300
National Geographic recently has been
really really impressive to me.

544
00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:31.100
They've been doing some really
cool things with with 3D

545
00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:34.400
visuals, which we rarely see
done and if we do

546
00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:37.000
see them they're rarely actually
done. Well, I'm so they've

547
00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.300
done some things with showing
planets in the solar system

548
00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:45.000
and even 3D models of
dinosaur bones and you can

549
00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.500
kind of play as a
as a archaeologist looking at

550
00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:53.900
looking at these fossils. I
think Beyond those ER one

551
00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:59.700
that I really loved recently
was this tree ring graphic

552
00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:05.200
of immigrations, which was I'll
I'll send you the link

553
00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:07.900
because I'm blanking on who
it was but it was

554
00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:11.300
it was just it was
just a beautiful combination of

555
00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:14.700
Aesthetics and information. It was
kind of a masterclass effect.

556
00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:18.200
Was that the National Geographic
200 years of u.s. Immigration

557
00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:20.600
looks like the Rings at
yeah. That's the one. Yeah,

558
00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:23.000
these kind of things are
really really significant because they're

559
00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.600
taking Something organic and then
aligning it with something organic

560
00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:30.100
that we intuitively know at,
you know, we know as

561
00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:32.100
we learn a small children
how the rings of a

562
00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:35.700
tree Express Generations. So what
a clever way to take

563
00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:37.900
what could be a boring
radial graph and make it

564
00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:42.700
feel organic. Exactly. Yeah kind
of piggybacking on people's existing

565
00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:45.200
understandings of how trees work
and using it as a

566
00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:48.600
metaphor. I think was really
brilliant there. Yeah, that's fantastic.

567
00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:51.500
I will be sure to
include links to that and

568
00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:54.600
people can go and explore
Nat Geo. So.com, which is

569
00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:58.000
full of great stuff like
this all throughout some of

570
00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.600
the best work in visualization
as well as the work

571
00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:03.500
that happened as you mentioned
on 538 that you were

572
00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:07.000
associated with as well. Thank
you. Yeah. Well, thank you

573
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000
so much. I really appreciate
you chatting me with me

574
00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.800
today Matthew conlon. It's been
great. Thanks so much for

575
00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:14.900
having me. This has been
another episode of Hansel minutes

576
00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:16.700
and we'll see you again
next week.
