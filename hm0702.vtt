G U n.com. This is

11
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.310
Scott Hanselman, this Hansel minutes
today. I'm talking with Tai

12
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.990
Tamara. He's the CEO of
panel data web sites, design

13
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.920
development shop out of New Jersey.
How are you, sir? Very

14
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.040
good. Great to be on
with you. So you and

15
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.160
I have a, a shared
kind of interest and that

16
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.230
is, you know, being productive,
right? I mean, as a

17
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.770
CEO of a company that
does develop and design websites,

18
00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.900
you've got to juggle a
lot and you know, I

19
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.650
manage community for visual studio
and I work at Microsoft

20
00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.010
and I'm juggling a lot.
How many emails do you

21
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.830
have in your inbox? Right?
No, I don't know. Right

22
00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.030
now I get to zero
every morning, usually in the

23
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.740
morning I have maybe 20,
25, so I don't get

24
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.260
the volume that I know
a lot of people get,

25
00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.020
but a lot of that
comes down to, you know,

26
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.170
our communication style. It can't
deliver where we have more

27
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.190
base camp messages and things
in other places. And it

28
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.470
also comes down to the
way that I communicate in

29
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.560
general, which is to try
to encourage, you know, longer,

30
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.380
more substantive, email communication. So,
so yeah, that's skipping ahead

31
00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.240
a little bit to some
of the, some of the

32
00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.880
tricks that I've learned over
the years, but yeah, I

33
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.480
definitely have a passion for,
for productivity that kind of

34
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.840
started as a necessity because
when I was just taking

35
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.420
on more and more stuff,
as I think a lot

36
00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.560
of people find is their
careers evolve. And then especially

37
00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.550
having children, it became critical
for me to figure out

38
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.160
my strategy and, and, you
know, get my act together.

39
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.850
No, you know, every company
is different. The company I

40
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.120
work at is very email
heavy. You know, you use

41
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.420
Slack, we use teams. I've
started to realize that all

42
00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.570
of these are different inboxes,
right? Like you might say,

43
00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.450
you only get 25 emails
in the morning. You know,

44
00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.020
maybe I get probably maybe
a hundred, 150, but you

45
00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.480
probably get a lot more
slacks and that's a kind

46
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.670
of an inbox as well.
There are multiple inboxes in

47
00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.980
our lives. Yes, absolutely. I
think that's one of the

48
00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.850
key things that people need
to understand is that a

49
00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.500
true productivity strategy is something
that lets you consolidate all

50
00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.760
of those things into one
place. Whether it's your kid

51
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.060
coming up to you with
a permission slip or a,

52
00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.780
your car breaking down or
a, an email coming in

53
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.810
or a text message, all
of that needs to go

54
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.500
into a single consolidated location.
Otherwise you're absolutely going to

55
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.980
go insane trying to remember,
you know, what, what happened

56
00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.250
in certain areas and parsing
that out into actions and,

57
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.820
you know, especially when it
comes to, should I do

58
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.190
X or should I do
Y that's so hard to,

59
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.270
to make a judgment on
when your responsibilities are distributed

60
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.290
among different systems. Yeah. I
think the, the thing that

61
00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.620
helped me was the, the,
the recognition, the decision in

62
00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.980
my own head, that there
was more than one inbox.

63
00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.560
And then when we say
inbox, we, we may think

64
00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.500
email, but you know, physical
bills that come in the

65
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.990
mail and we still get,
I still get mail. Like,

66
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.840
male's a thing you can't,
everyone likes to say that,

67
00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.770
Oh, I've automated. Everything I've
already been at all my,

68
00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.650
well, you know, every once
in a while, something physical

69
00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.720
shows up, you need to
deal with it. That's, that's

70
00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.810
an inbox as well. Yes,
absolutely. Or something is signed

71
00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.410
or needs to be signed
or center notary Republic or

72
00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.960
whatever. Oh my goodness. I
don't, I don't know if

73
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.300
you own your house. Yeah.
I mean, I have to

74
00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.910
deal with property taxes and
physical things that come in

75
00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.730
the mail. I have a
house, you realize how much

76
00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.000
the rest of the economy
is still relies on fax

77
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.420
machines and lots of paper
that has to be very,

78
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.210
very particularly kind of taken
care of and transported from

79
00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.930
place to place. And absolutely
cashier's checks in your hand

80
00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.950
for a ungodly amounts of
money. And you're just like

81
00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.300
scratching your, your eyes out,
thinking of the inefficiency as

82
00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.520
a digital person, but that's
the world we live in.

83
00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.470
And, you know, even if
you, you, you know, try

84
00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.440
to streamline, you know, your,
your daily life, you are

85
00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.210
also a part of other
people's lives and you're going

86
00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.730
to need to be able
to interact with those folks

87
00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:50.100
in a way that's convenient
for them. Yeah. I had

88
00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.930
a person come over and
do some work on my

89
00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.440
house yesterday and they would
take a check or cash

90
00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.740
and, and, and that was
a thing. Right. And that

91
00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.570
was, that was it. And,
and, and people might be

92
00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:01.920
listening and saying, well, why
aren't they, why did they

93
00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.340
take Stripe, frankly, they didn't
know Stripe exists. You know,

94
00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.620
I don't even know if
their flip phone would run

95
00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.860
Stripe, like right. Not everyone
has that Privilege. Right. It's

96
00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.290
a comfort level thing, but
what's great is if you

97
00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:16.410
have a sound productivity strategy
as sort of a digitally

98
00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.910
minded person, you can convert
a lot of those inputs

99
00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.120
into something that can be
digitally managed. And then you

100
00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.330
can all the advantages of
that system or your, you

101
00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.910
know, your philosophy or your
approach. But you're also still

102
00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:32.160
like inter interfacing with the
rest of the world in

103
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.860
a, in a way that
is sensible to them. Because,

104
00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.410
you know, if you try
to send that, who was

105
00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.150
it, who was at your
house? So it was a

106
00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.030
handy person. Yeah. So you
tried to send, send them

107
00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.970
a link to your, you
know, online portal where they

108
00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.100
can receive payment. I think
that's probably not going to

109
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.530
be too, too pleased. So
you need to be able

110
00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:53.100
to, to act as the,
as the bus, if you

111
00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.140
will, to get, get signal
from one place to the

112
00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:59.030
other, and that's, you, you
can kind of be in

113
00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:00.920
your own domain and have
things set up the way

114
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.440
that you want, but, but
still, still interface reasonably with,

115
00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:08.230
with everyone else. I think
also the, when I first

116
00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:11.170
started my productivity kind of
journey, which was my, you

117
00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:13.780
know, that moment when you
say I'm overwhelmed was I

118
00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:15.700
thought that what I needed
was a prescription. So I

119
00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.590
would go and ask people
to tell me all about

120
00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:20.500
their tools. Like tell me
what you use, but now

121
00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.350
I've realized that it's not
about the tools. Like, I

122
00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:25.270
don't want to know what
you tie use as a

123
00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:27.910
tool. It's interesting, but the
fact that you set up

124
00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:31.180
a system, your tool might
be to do dot text,

125
00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.850
or it might be, you
know, a to do app

126
00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.890
or Wunderlist or whatever. I
don't know. But it's, it's

127
00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:38.260
the fact that your conscious,
I think, is what's important.

128
00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:42.130
Yeah. It can be a
paper notebook or a series

129
00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:45.880
of paper notebooks, you know,
stone tablets, if you want,

130
00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:48.460
if you're, if you're good,
if, if that's your style,

131
00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:51.880
go for it. Yeah, you're
right. The number one thing

132
00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:54.100
is, is the fact that
you have a system. And

133
00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:57.040
I think the system that
you have does need to

134
00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:01.870
have certain characteristics and, you
know, to, to provide some

135
00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:06.400
background. My personal strategy is
based heavily off the getting

136
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.330
things done methodology by David Allen.
And I'm, I'm very much,

137
00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.570
you know, inspired by, by
his writing and the, the

138
00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:18.640
work that their company has
done. And so fundamentally the

139
00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.670
way that you want your
system to be, which is

140
00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:24.340
sort of your, your database,
your repository of everything that

141
00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:26.920
you need to do, and
all the commitments you've made,

142
00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:28.930
and even things you want
to do that you don't

143
00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:33.250
need to do. You need
that to be instantly accessible

144
00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.670
wherever you are. That's a,
that's a key role. So

145
00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:38.230
like, if you're a paper
person, you need to at

146
00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:39.820
least make sure that, you
know, you have one of

147
00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:43.240
your notebooks on you at
all times, because you know,

148
00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.280
how many times have you
been in that situation where

149
00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:48.910
you get a phone call
or you are in a

150
00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:51.820
conversation with someone and they
say, you know, let's just

151
00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:54.220
say they recommend a book.
You really want to read

152
00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:56.650
that book. If you just
try to remember all of

153
00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:59.050
those things for the rest
of your life, not only

154
00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:01.120
is your head going to
be full of stuff that

155
00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:03.040
you might not be relevant
to you at any given

156
00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.050
moment, but you're going to
let a lot of things

157
00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:08.170
slip through the cracks. So
you need to be able

158
00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:13.660
to externalize your memory so
that you're never reliant just

159
00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:16.000
on being able to, you
know, kind of keep up

160
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.070
with all the input, but
you have these, these tools.

161
00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:21.170
And we, you know, we
have tools in, in this,

162
00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:23.560
this day and age, and
we don't have to rely

163
00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.590
on our brains as a,
as a storage mechanism. And

164
00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:28.750
I think once you, once
you make that sort of

165
00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:32.650
mental switch to think that
your brain is about processing

166
00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:39.430
information, not storing information theme
of the GTD methodology, that

167
00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:43.720
is revolutionary, you, you, you
externalize all of your tracking

168
00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:47.290
and your monitoring of those
commitments, and you just get

169
00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:50.530
to focus your brainpower on
solving your problems on being

170
00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:54.610
creative on getting, you know,
literally getting things done. That's,

171
00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:57.920
that's a switch for a
lot of people. That is

172
00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.170
a really interesting and cool
way to think about it.

173
00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:03.980
The, the idea that I
am good at processing, I'm

174
00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:07.490
not good at, at keeping
a lot of information in

175
00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:10.880
high fidelity, right? Yeah. Wrote,
wrote memorization is also not

176
00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:14.990
fun. Well, checking boxes on
to do list is fun.

177
00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:17.540
Yes, Yes, yes. And being
up until two in the

178
00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:19.940
morning, going through all the
things in your head that

179
00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:21.410
you're trying not to forget
that you have to do

180
00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:24.410
tomorrow is that's a painful
place as well. And it's

181
00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:26.450
also a painful place when
you do drop the ball.

182
00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:29.300
And you do forget that,
you know, birthday or that,

183
00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:31.820
that, you know, thing you
were supposed to pick up

184
00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:35.540
before you got home because
someone's coming over. So, you

185
00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:38.540
know, I think it's, it's
pivotal. If you want to,

186
00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:42.530
if you want to grow,
if you want to achieve,

187
00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:46.280
you know, big, complicated things
in the world, whatever that

188
00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:50.810
is, it's pivotal that you
sit down and establish the,

189
00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:53.510
the method that you're going
to use to process all

190
00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:57.260
of these inputs and these
commitments and, and actually be

191
00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:02.060
accountable to all of them.
And one great thing there

192
00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:04.910
is if you create a
system and you establish your

193
00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:07.070
life in a way that
you know that you're going

194
00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:09.560
to get to all of
your commitments, and that's incredibly

195
00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:13.430
powerful, and it's powerful for
your relationships because people can

196
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:16.760
count on you more, but
it's also powerful for yourself

197
00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:20.570
because like I remember going
back all the way to

198
00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:25.190
third grade, I used to
be, you know, lying in

199
00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:28.400
bed, thinking of the homework
that I hadn't done and

200
00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:29.960
how I was going to
have to figure out how

201
00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.330
to, you know, get out
of it or weasel around

202
00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:34.280
it tomorrow, or squeeze it
in at lunch or something

203
00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:38.090
like that. And that, that
like creeping sense of dread

204
00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:39.980
in the back of your
head, that am I doing

205
00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:42.470
everything that I needed to
have I prepared properly? Have

206
00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:46.220
I remembered everything? That's a
huge mental drag. And then

207
00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:48.350
if you're a creative person,
especially like if you're trying

208
00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:51.740
to make music or pain
or, you know, teach people

209
00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:54.110
or whatever you're trying to
do, being able to just

210
00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:56.060
totally be in the moment,
know that all of your

211
00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:58.820
commitments are taken care of
that everything's going to happen.

212
00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.970
And that you're, you are
keeping your promises to the

213
00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:04.400
outside world that makes you
feel better about yourself. And

214
00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:06.110
it makes it frees you
up to be able to

215
00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:09.560
do it. Yeah. The word
that I have historically used

216
00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:13.820
in my talks on productivity
is the psychic weight. Oh,

217
00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:16.550
yes. Of the things like
people don't realize, like, I

218
00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:19.040
don't know about you, but
I have multiple monitors. And

219
00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:20.720
on one of those monitors,
I like to keep the

220
00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:23.420
process Explorer or the task
manager running. And I tend

221
00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:26.510
to short by CPU. And
I've done that so long

222
00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:28.490
that I bet you that
there's one in my head,

223
00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:31.520
there's a task manager in
my head. You run top

224
00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:34.010
all day. I run top
or H H top. I

225
00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:36.980
mean, I'm not a Savage,
right. You know, a sorted

226
00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:41.300
by CPU. Yeah, exactly. Sorted
by CPU. And I could

227
00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:45.560
tell you when I don't
have a Mino my system

228
00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:47.030
with me, maybe I don't
have my phone, or I

229
00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:50.690
fail to write something down.
The psychic weight is 3%,

230
00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:54.160
5%, 7%, you know, it's
that, it's that little process

231
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:55.840
running in the background. You're
like, what is it that

232
00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.780
you're doing? And, you know,
if you kill dash nine,

233
00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:01.000
that process, you're probably not
going to end up bringing

234
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.060
milk home, or you're going
to forget something important. And

235
00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:06.550
then you'll have let someone
down. Maybe it's a small

236
00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:08.530
thing. Like you didn't bring
milk and you don't have

237
00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:10.150
milk for your teeth. Or
maybe it's a big thing.

238
00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:11.890
Like you forgot to meet
with the vice president at

239
00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:15.650
work. And you're a no
show. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. It

240
00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:18.270
doesn't take many of those
moments to kind of convince

241
00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:21.000
people that, you know, it's
time to make a switch.

242
00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.060
I, you know, I talked
to people about this and

243
00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:28.680
a lot of people kind
of naturally put together a

244
00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:33.420
methodology that, that kind of
works enough, you know? And

245
00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:35.670
that's, that's the necessity part
is that I think most

246
00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:38.910
people, if they're trying to
do something creative or, or

247
00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:42.990
difficult, especially in technology, they're
going to have to adapt

248
00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:46.860
to a certain degree, but
where, where you really take

249
00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:49.560
it to the next level
is being deliberate about the

250
00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:52.710
way that you want that
system to function. And the,

251
00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:55.200
the, you know, the manner
in which you plan to,

252
00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:59.070
to work from it and
process it. And those are

253
00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:01.340
things, you know, if you're
interested in this topic that

254
00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:03.570
get the book, getting things
done is, is excellent. There's

255
00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:06.000
also, you know, David, Allen's
been all over the place

256
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.490
doing Ted talks and such,
and you can find a

257
00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:09.990
lot of resources on that.
And there's a lot of

258
00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:14.880
other strategies available as well.
But the number one thing

259
00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:18.630
is that you, you need
to learn how you're going

260
00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:21.480
to live with your system,
because if you just, you

261
00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.400
know, just establishing where you're
going to keep all your

262
00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.230
crap is not going to
get the crap, you know,

263
00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:29.640
dealt with. So that's, that's
the sort of second pillar

264
00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:31.170
of this is that, you
know, first of all, you

265
00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:32.490
need a system, but second
of all, you need a

266
00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:35.070
relationship with that system. You
know, what, what are you

267
00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:38.760
going to do on a
daily, weekly, monthly, yearly basis

268
00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:41.450
to ensure that that system
is up to date and,

269
00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:45.030
and that it parallels accurately
your priorities within your life.

270
00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:49.890
Hey, friends, summers longer days
and slower pace. Invite us

271
00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:52.800
to pick up a book,
follow our questions and try

272
00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:55.920
our hand at something new.
The work of modern software

273
00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:58.650
developers is evolving in ways
that are both challenging and

274
00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:01.950
rewarding. As a developer, it's
essential that you cultivate a

275
00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:05.700
security mindset and to help
we've put together a collection

276
00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:10.260
of information, security books, podcasts,
blogs, and hands on exercises

277
00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:14.490
recommended by Vera coders, across
our development security and product

278
00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:18.660
teams from a just published
page Turner to classic frac

279
00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:21.600
articles. There's something here for
everyone who is interested in

280
00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.960
becoming more security minded. So
dip your toes in, or

281
00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:29.520
take a deep dive visit
www dot Vira code. That's

282
00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:39.930
V R a code.com/reading that's
code.com/reading. Do you think that

283
00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:43.170
people should learn that should
be taught? This is this

284
00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:46.110
something that should be a
class because I'm looking at

285
00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:48.630
my 13 year old, who
is going to be going

286
00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:52.370
into high school soon and
is doing a mediocre job

287
00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:55.250
at managing his homework and
his life. I'm looking at

288
00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:58.250
my nephew who just graduated
from high school. And frankly,

289
00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:01.820
I'm amazed that he pulled
it off with, with the

290
00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:05.270
scheduling systems that they have.
And then my niece, who

291
00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:07.250
is now out of college
and going into the workplace.

292
00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:11.180
So I've got these kinds
of different people going from

293
00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:14.480
different stages of their life.
And none of them really

294
00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:16.790
seem to have formal systems.
And, you know, with all

295
00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:19.640
due respect to them, they've
tended to miss things. They

296
00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:21.800
forget there's a party today,
and they forgot that there

297
00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:23.540
was a, you know, it's
the homework is the night

298
00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:26.270
before, or I didn't realize
we were going to meet

299
00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:28.970
today. I thought that was
Tuesday. And you can't just

300
00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:31.430
say, Hey, young person, why
don't you use Google calendar?

301
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:35.870
This is larger. I don't
remember ever learning organizational theory

302
00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:39.880
in school. It's absurd. Yeah.
A thousand percent. It should

303
00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:42.160
be a class. I mean,
add that to the list

304
00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:45.190
of things that ought to
be a class like changing

305
00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:49.390
a tire, changing a diaper,
doing your taxes. It should

306
00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:51.580
all be a class. Absolutely.
Yes. It should be delight

307
00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:53.740
life skills class. I mean,
I'm sure like in the,

308
00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:55.750
in the age of a
shop class, you know, maybe

309
00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:59.470
this was more top of
mind, you know, academically, but

310
00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:02.740
yeah, I, I think absolutely.
And one thing you can

311
00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:05.350
do is if you're a
part of an institution, like

312
00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:07.450
let's say you're a teacher
and you're dealing with high

313
00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:10.780
schoolers, one thing you can
help them do is learn

314
00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:13.510
how to manage the commitments
that they make to you.

315
00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:17.350
You know? So if you
say that a certain assignments

316
00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:19.000
due on a certain day,
or you, you give a

317
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.790
kid a, a mandate to
bring you some research by

318
00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:24.940
a certain date or whatever,
ask them, you know, how

319
00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:27.820
do you plan to do
that? What are you gonna,

320
00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:29.950
what are you going to
change or implement in your

321
00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:31.660
life so that you make
sure that that's going to

322
00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:34.120
happen? You know, and you're
going to have your exceptional

323
00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:36.700
kids who just, you know,
actually have the brain power

324
00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:40.090
to keep things in their
mind and also execute things

325
00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:41.590
at a high level, which
is, you know, it's never

326
00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:44.770
me. That is not me
either. Yeah. I don't think

327
00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:46.600
this is about being born
this way. Like, this is

328
00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:49.660
something that is absolutely taught,
you know, Taught and it's,

329
00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:53.650
it's, it's vital. I think
if you were able to,

330
00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:57.610
to introduce that, even just
the thought that like, yeah,

331
00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:59.560
maybe I need something to
keep track of all this

332
00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:02.440
into the life of a,
of a young person that

333
00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:05.380
that's vital. And then, you
know, as you mentioned, you,

334
00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:09.220
we have people coming out
of college who have never

335
00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:13.900
really had to deal with,
you know, capital R capital

336
00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:17.590
L real life and all
the bills coming in and

337
00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:20.950
all the commitments and all
the relationships that are, that

338
00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:23.770
are a part of being
an adult. And, and, you

339
00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:27.550
know, as a, an employer,
I think one major thing

340
00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:30.580
you can do is, is
try to evangelize and communicate

341
00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:34.480
these ideas within your organization,
because not only are your

342
00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:38.440
people going to improve in,
you know, productivity, nominally, but

343
00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:41.470
more importantly, they're going to
feel a sense of peace

344
00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:43.930
in their life because they,
they feel that they're, they

345
00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:47.470
have their, their act together
and that's gonna, that's gonna

346
00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:50.670
reflect incredibly well on a,
you know, on, on the

347
00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:53.940
attitude and the, the, the
manner in which the work

348
00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:55.740
gets done when they're actually
at work. You know, if

349
00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:58.500
they feel that their commitments
at home are taken care

350
00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:01.770
of, or at least that
they're, they're logged and ready

351
00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:04.290
to be worked on when
needed, that's going to free

352
00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:06.720
people up mentally. So, yeah,
I think it's a vital

353
00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:10.770
amenity in the, in the
21st century for, for employers

354
00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:14.070
to encourage this kind of
thinking with their people, because

355
00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:16.710
you're just going to get
so much more, you know,

356
00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:21.300
refreshed and energized staff, if
you're able to, to emphasize

357
00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:23.690
a lot of these principles.
And a lot of these

358
00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:26.000
principles, as you've mentioned, have
been talked about whether it

359
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.360
be David, Allen's getting things
done, or Stephen Covey's seven

360
00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:32.630
habits of highly effective people.
These, these are, you know,

361
00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:36.080
productivity is a well known
and understood science, certainly a

362
00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:39.470
billion dollar business. But what
I think you and I

363
00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:43.070
are talking about is really
the philosophy of not letting

364
00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:46.610
life happen to you by
default, right? If you simply

365
00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:49.970
accept the defaults, then you're
going to have a challenge.

366
00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:52.910
But if you can somehow
be given the tools can

367
00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:56.780
be taught to sit down,
define work, and execute on

368
00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:59.210
work. Like on my list,
when I'm looking at my

369
00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:01.640
to do list right here,
it's got some work stuff,

370
00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:04.190
move this to the virtual
machine, set up this network,

371
00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:09.080
buy dirt. I need to
buy dirt. And I've actually

372
00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:11.060
using my little system here.
Cause I've got it in

373
00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:14.780
a reminder tool that when
I leave the house, it

374
00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:17.420
will say, Hey, don't forget
to buy dirt. As I

375
00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:20.270
leave the geo fence of
my house. And that's an,

376
00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:22.880
that's a nerd detail. But
when I explained it to

377
00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:26.210
nontechnical spouse and said, Hey,
you know that you can

378
00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:29.420
tell your personal assistant, remind
me to buy dirt when

379
00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:33.050
I leave here. And they
were like game changer, game

380
00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:37.880
changer, or suddenly I'm getting
things done. Yeah, Absolutely. So

381
00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:40.610
that, that so many good
points there, the first point

382
00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:43.070
you made about not letting
your life happen to you,

383
00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:45.080
I think that's, that's a
vital turning point as well.

384
00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:49.940
And I think that, you
know, that really well pertains

385
00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:51.800
to the topic of young
people, because I think young

386
00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:54.350
people are used to being
told, you know, be here

387
00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:56.870
at this time, get this
done by then. And then

388
00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:58.610
you're out in a, in,
in the world and you

389
00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:00.560
have situations where, you know,
no one's going to be

390
00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:02.750
nagging you. No, one's going
to be reminding you that,

391
00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:04.520
you know, you really need
to, to hand this in

392
00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:06.740
by a certain date. And
if something's late, you know,

393
00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:08.270
if you miss the train,
you miss the train. If

394
00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:10.130
you, if you missed that
flight, you missed that flight

395
00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:13.340
too bad. So I think
that's, that's something that's really

396
00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:16.310
pivotal to instill in people
is that, you know, you,

397
00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:19.160
you are in charge of
the commitments you make, but

398
00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:21.980
you're also in charge of
whether you, you actually fulfill

399
00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:24.470
those or not. And you're
going to feel so much

400
00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:28.610
more inner harmony and less
psychic weight as you put

401
00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:32.000
it. If you are accurately
and consistently delivering on the

402
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.820
promises that you make to
the world, you need to,

403
00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:36.320
you need to look at
your life as something that

404
00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:40.100
you're actively constructing and not
something that, that just kind

405
00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:44.000
of occurs. And I'm blanking
on the other, the fine,

406
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.890
insightful thing that you said
at the end, please from

407
00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:49.090
it. That's okay. I think
we both agree Though that

408
00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:51.960
the definition of work and
some applying, some things like

409
00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:54.100
the getting things done, you
know, do it drop it,

410
00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:55.990
delegated to for it. I'm
going to make sure we

411
00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:57.820
have links in the show
notes to all these kinds

412
00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:01.540
of things you and I
agree on, on philosophy. Let's

413
00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:05.530
compare notes on, on tools
though, because I think that

414
00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:07.660
the other thing is don't
take, and this is for

415
00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:10.270
the listener. Don't take my
word for it. Don't take

416
00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:12.640
Ty's word for it. Try
a tool if it makes

417
00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:15.430
you happy, drop it. Like
the great thing about advice

418
00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:18.000
is you don't have to
take it. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.

419
00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:20.670
And you know, in speaking
about our tools, I think

420
00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:22.770
we can kind of contextualize
that for people to like,

421
00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:24.840
yeah, what is it about
this that works for us

422
00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:28.240
in particular? I started with
my, you know, when I

423
00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:30.240
was overwhelmed in the, you
know, in the early days

424
00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:33.390
it was to do dot
text on my desktop and

425
00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:36.810
that graduated to a Palm
pilot that I would carry

426
00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:40.250
in my pocket everywhere, which
graduated too early. I'm living,

427
00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:43.140
you know how I'm living?
I know your lifestyle. Yeah.

428
00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:46.380
That's true. Yeah. So, you
know, Palm pilot, and then

429
00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:49.470
I graduated to, you know,
the reminders list on my

430
00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:53.400
iPhone. And then I realized
what the reminders list on

431
00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:56.190
my iPhone, that it wasn't
everywhere. That the thing that

432
00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:59.070
you stated it has to
be everywhere. I use it

433
00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:03.210
still sometimes, but I ended
up graduating. I use Microsoft

434
00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:06.900
to do which, which I
was, I would say I

435
00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:09.210
was initially dismissive of. I
was like, okay. I mean,

436
00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:11.190
Microsoft has a to do
app. I don't really care,

437
00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:14.220
but it's got an iPhone
app. It's got a Mac

438
00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:17.550
app, it's got a windows
app. It synchronizes everywhere. And

439
00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:20.640
if I flag an email,
it shows up as a,

440
00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:23.610
to do. If someone assigns
me a task, it shows

441
00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:27.270
up and to do so,
it is everywhere. And that

442
00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:29.790
it is the ever presence
of it. That was what

443
00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:32.430
I needed for at least
my list of to do's.

444
00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:35.730
And then that plus Dropbox
puts the data wherever I'm

445
00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:38.310
at, because Dropbox is on
my, my Apple devices at

446
00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:41.220
my windows devices. And I
would say Microsoft to do

447
00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:44.100
plus Dropbox has been everything
I've needed so far. Right,

448
00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:48.990
right. That's great. So my
primary system is in OmniFocus,

449
00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:55.550
which is a outline of,
of, of tools for, for

450
00:22:55.740 --> 00:23:00.930
productivity. And so basically every
single commitment in my life

451
00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:04.800
goes into OmniFocus as a,
to do. And then from

452
00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:07.740
there, I process that into
the different buckets and, and

453
00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:11.040
contexts in which I can,
I, I will, will be.

454
00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:14.040
And that's a, that's a
pivotal step that I didn't

455
00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:16.380
get to touch on yet.
Yeah. Context. What about what,

456
00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:19.020
what's the context? Yeah. So
a context is something you

457
00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:22.830
need in order to accomplish
a certain task. So if

458
00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:25.860
you have buy dirt, your
context, there is a, you

459
00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:28.440
know, depends on how you
live. In my case, I

460
00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:30.450
work at home. I'm not
usually in the car, so

461
00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:33.300
that situation I would put
car. And so I have

462
00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:36.090
a category of contexts that
are, that are equipment and

463
00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:38.370
the car is one of
those things. It's not always

464
00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:40.770
at home. Usually my wife
has it when it's here

465
00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:42.150
and I have the chance
to, you know, go to

466
00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:45.070
home Depot and get the
dirt. That's, that's the, the

467
00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:46.910
tool that I'm going to
need to make that happen,

468
00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:49.790
but you can also have
contexts that represent other people.

469
00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:52.460
So I might have a
Scott context for, you know,

470
00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:54.590
when, when we're chatting, these
are some things that I

471
00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:56.810
want to bring up with
you, or I might have

472
00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:58.610
a con you know, I've
I've context for my children.

473
00:23:58.670 --> 00:23:59.930
You know, I have, I
have things that I need

474
00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:01.730
to need to remind them
of, or talk to them

475
00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:04.760
about or help prepare them
for. And I need them

476
00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:08.480
there in order to have
that conversation, right. So contexts

477
00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:11.060
are, are key because what
that lets you do is

478
00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:13.400
if you take all of
that input, everything that you

479
00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:15.980
need to do, and you
split that up into the

480
00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:18.830
buckets and into buckets, according
to what you need in

481
00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:21.500
order to finish them, then
all you need to do

482
00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:24.620
to look for something productive
to do is go to

483
00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:28.520
the appropriate bucket. So if
you're at the doctor's office

484
00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:30.710
and you have 10 minutes,
well, what do you have?

485
00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:33.530
You have your phone. So
look in your phone context,

486
00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:36.740
look at all the things
that you previously have designated.

487
00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:38.540
These are things that I
can accomplish with just my

488
00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:41.540
phone or when you're, you
know, I just mentioned, you

489
00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:44.380
know, my context with my
kids, if I'm, you know,

490
00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:46.940
if we have a, a
nice walk home or we're

491
00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:49.160
in the car, I know
that I can just take

492
00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:51.080
a quick glance at my
system. I know the, you

493
00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:52.580
know, two or three things
that I wanted to chat

494
00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:55.700
with them about. So I
can make sure that when

495
00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:59.330
that resource is available or
that that person is available,

496
00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:01.760
that I'm taking full advantage
and I'm doing things that

497
00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:06.050
I can uniquely do in
that situation. So yeah, when

498
00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:08.000
you're, when you're in front
of your computer at your

499
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.010
desk, you don't want to
be doing things that you

500
00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:12.320
could be doing at the
doctor's office. You know what

501
00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:13.880
I mean? You want to
be doing things that you

502
00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:16.370
can uniquely do in that
situation, with the tools you

503
00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:19.190
have available and push the
rest of it off until

504
00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:22.370
other situations. So that overall
within the course of your

505
00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:24.940
day, you're getting more out
of your day, Right? And

506
00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:28.900
that context can be a
place like, you know, shopping

507
00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:32.170
or in standing in line.
It can be a thing.

508
00:25:32.170 --> 00:25:34.570
Like I have my phone,
I have my laptop, or

509
00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:37.000
it could be a Headspace.
If there's a thing that

510
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.120
you can't do until unless
your context is, you know,

511
00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:43.540
calm or, you know, free
time or whatever. Like if

512
00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:46.330
you're working on the great
American novel, you need to

513
00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:47.530
be in a certain head
space. That can be a

514
00:25:47.530 --> 00:25:49.870
kind of context as well.
If a two in that

515
00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:53.320
vein, which I find very
helpful one is when I

516
00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:56.110
feel creative. So when I,
when I feel like I

517
00:25:56.110 --> 00:25:58.570
can, I can knock something
out, you know, if you

518
00:25:58.570 --> 00:26:02.440
do any writing or, you
know, speaking things like that,

519
00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:07.000
sometimes a given article will
take you all day and

520
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.030
sometimes it'll take you an
hour and it's really hard

521
00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:11.710
to predict kind of when
that Headspace is going to

522
00:26:11.710 --> 00:26:15.330
happen, at least for me.
So I love having that,

523
00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:17.500
that context because if I,
if I have energy, if

524
00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:19.900
I have a little short
block of time, I know

525
00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:22.900
that there's something that requires
my focus and creativity that

526
00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:25.600
I can, that I can
do probably much faster than

527
00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:28.870
I will be able to
in a different place. Like

528
00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:31.080
an airplane for instance, is
a great example. That's, that's

529
00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:36.370
a wonderful situation for your
creative context. The other context

530
00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:39.700
I have for Headspace is
tired mode. So when I'm

531
00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:41.200
dragging at the end of
the day, you know, it's

532
00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:45.030
getting to five o'clock or
whatever. I still have another

533
00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:47.040
20 minutes before my kids
are home and I'm going

534
00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:49.040
to be giving them dinner
or whatever, but I, I

535
00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:50.490
still have a window of
time where I've got my

536
00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:52.710
computer, but I'm shot, you
know, it's the end of

537
00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:56.160
the day, what can I
do? So this is a

538
00:26:56.190 --> 00:27:00.060
simpler emails, you know, following
up on things, remembering to

539
00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:04.020
just check in or do
research or, you know, just

540
00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:06.990
brainstorm something. Those are perfect
things for your, for your

541
00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:09.720
tired context. And that, that
lets you get the maximum

542
00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:11.730
out of those moments when
you're not feeling your best.

543
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.550
And what you're doing there
is you're, since you are

544
00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:17.610
taking that time to take
care of those tasks, those

545
00:27:17.610 --> 00:27:19.350
tasks aren't getting in the
way, when you do have

546
00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:23.810
more energy. Hmm. It sounds
to me like you all,

547
00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:26.270
you, you, you did this
on your own. Do you

548
00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:28.070
think you were always this
way or did someone teach

549
00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:32.240
you? So I was mostly
self directed in this regard,

550
00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:34.760
as I mentioned, you know,
mostly out of, out of

551
00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:38.180
necessity, just having a lot
on my plate and having

552
00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:42.350
to figure out ways to,
to, you know, process all

553
00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:45.590
of that. I would say
the, the getting things done

554
00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:48.110
book was pretty pivotal. I
mean, I think probably the

555
00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:51.590
way I found it was
through articles online, just reading

556
00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:55.080
up on different to do
list strategies like you, I,

557
00:27:55.130 --> 00:27:57.680
I think I started with
text files or, you know,

558
00:27:57.710 --> 00:28:01.670
very simple applications, sort of
like one access to do

559
00:28:01.670 --> 00:28:06.410
lists and then kind of
advanced into, into thinking in

560
00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:09.800
a more GTD aligned manner
and building up my tool

561
00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:13.050
set. So it was a
pretty slow process. And the,

562
00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:15.800
the other thing I would
say with GTD in particular

563
00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:20.240
is that I got on
it and I was using

564
00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:23.540
it for about a year.
And then I really learned

565
00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:27.140
how to use it really,
really took me. It took

566
00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:29.540
me probably a year, year
and a half before I

567
00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:33.980
went from just like nominally
applying these ideas to really

568
00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:36.710
relying on it in my
life. And that was a

569
00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:39.530
big turning point because that
was where I really started

570
00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:42.080
to trust the system and
think that, you know, I,

571
00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:45.170
if I was holding something
in my head, I started

572
00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:47.300
to get that sense that,
Nope, this is wrong. You

573
00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:49.910
know, something's wrong about the
situation I have to have

574
00:28:49.910 --> 00:28:54.020
to deal with it. So
yeah. Mostly self directed. Yeah.

575
00:28:54.050 --> 00:28:56.090
I think the acknowledgement though,
like what do they say?

576
00:28:56.090 --> 00:29:00.080
Step one is realizing you
have a problem. Yeah, absolutely.

577
00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:02.690
And you know, speaking to
your point about with, with

578
00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:05.210
kids. So I think it's
a gift that I really

579
00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:08.210
look forward to giving to
them is a framework to

580
00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:10.280
think about their life. You
know, that, as you said,

581
00:29:10.550 --> 00:29:13.310
it's not attached to a
software tool. It's not attached

582
00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:17.630
to any particular tactic. It's
a way of thinking about

583
00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:21.440
your life. And people often
think, Oh, you know, productivity

584
00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:26.210
is for work. Productivity means
cranking out more widgets during

585
00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:29.390
your day than, than the
other person. And that it's

586
00:29:29.390 --> 00:29:35.090
thereby sort of it would,
would, would capitalistic be too

587
00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:37.700
much Mister. Well, I think
that the point isn't to

588
00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:42.430
optimize for production yes. Exact
point is to optimize for

589
00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:45.070
what you want to optimize
for. Yeah. There's a, there's

590
00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:47.110
a famous quote. And I
actually talk about it in

591
00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:51.550
my productivity. Talk my own
talk where a gentleman says,

592
00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:54.790
if, if, if something in
my life is not making

593
00:29:54.790 --> 00:29:59.140
me money, then it's it's
out. So I, I scratch

594
00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:02.080
that part about money out.
And I said, if it's

595
00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:06.130
not underscore where there's a
blank space, if it's not

596
00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:10.600
whatever where whatever is the
thing that you care about.

597
00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:13.540
If it's not blank, helping
me spend time with my

598
00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:17.110
family, if it's not helping
me get, you know, build

599
00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:18.970
my business. If it's not
helping me spend time with

600
00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:22.390
my, you know, sick grandparents,
whatever the thing is that

601
00:30:22.390 --> 00:30:24.670
you care about should be
the thing you're optimizing for.

602
00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:26.950
So when you say, you
know, you have that feeling,

603
00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:28.450
when you ask a friend,
you're like, how do you

604
00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:29.680
have so many hours in
a day? I don't know

605
00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:33.070
how you get so much
done. It's very likely that

606
00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:37.090
it is not that they
it's intentionality. It is the

607
00:30:37.090 --> 00:30:40.330
intentional illness of it. And
this can be the same,

608
00:30:40.330 --> 00:30:43.090
whether you're a computer person
or whether you're working the

609
00:30:43.090 --> 00:30:49.330
fryer later at, at McDonald's,
the productive people. They, you

610
00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:51.070
know, we have, we have
privilege and that we can

611
00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:54.010
make these tools. But when
I didn't have privileges, when

612
00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:55.960
I didn't have money, I
was doing a lot of

613
00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:58.750
this work in a, in
a, in a folded, a

614
00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:01.740
folded piece of paper. Yeah.
And if you, if you

615
00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:03.630
are working the fryer later,
you know, what are you

616
00:31:03.810 --> 00:31:06.090
trying to do after that?
Yeah, Exactly. Because you're going

617
00:31:06.090 --> 00:31:09.810
to school at night, You
should be listening to audio

618
00:31:09.810 --> 00:31:12.360
books, you know, while you're
at, Probably not while you're

619
00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:14.490
on the fries, but yeah,
I hear you one year,

620
00:31:14.490 --> 00:31:16.620
one year, That's fine. That's,
that's not a health and

621
00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:21.030
safety concern, but yeah, it's,
it's finding those, those, those

622
00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:25.260
advantages. And that's where I
think people, people get it

623
00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:28.740
a little bit wrong is
they think that anything to

624
00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:32.250
do with productivity means doing
more work and being more.

625
00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:36.750
And that's exactly precisely the
opposite. It's that if you

626
00:31:36.810 --> 00:31:40.230
optimize the things you have
to do within your day,

627
00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:42.720
that gives you more time
for the things you want

628
00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:45.720
to do in your day.
That's really, really important. I

629
00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:47.580
think that's even where we
should end on that. Because

630
00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:50.730
what you're saying is you
get in, you do the

631
00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:54.120
thing and you get out.
Yep. And you don't spend

632
00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:56.790
time on Facebook and you
don't waste time. You know,

633
00:31:56.790 --> 00:31:58.890
if you're in a cab,
you're getting the, the, if

634
00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:00.690
let's say you have eight
hours of work to do

635
00:32:00.690 --> 00:32:04.560
in a day, if you
can sneak in more of

636
00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:07.380
that eight hours into the,
you know, time that you

637
00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:09.510
have the time window that
you have to do your

638
00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:12.210
work, what a quote that
is going to leave you

639
00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:13.830
time at the end of
the day, you might be

640
00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:16.620
done an hour earlier than
you thought you might be

641
00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:18.930
able to go, you know,
go to that soccer practice

642
00:32:18.930 --> 00:32:20.760
that you thought you weren't
going to make, or put

643
00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:24.690
time into that book, or,
you know, write that song

644
00:32:24.690 --> 00:32:26.850
that you've been thinking about.
That's been rattling around in

645
00:32:26.850 --> 00:32:29.250
your head. You know, you,
you just have to imagine

646
00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:32.010
most of us have so
little time, you know, I've

647
00:32:32.010 --> 00:32:34.500
got I've, I've really got
a couple hours at the

648
00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:36.480
end of the day where
I can really just hang

649
00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:40.850
out and do what I'm
interested in. So if I

650
00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:43.430
can squeeze in an extra
hour, an extra two hours,

651
00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:46.730
that's increasing the amount of
actual free time that I

652
00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:51.560
have by a huge percentage.
Exactly. Everybody has this time,

653
00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:54.500
somewhere in their life. And
it's just about setting up

654
00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:58.430
a system and devoting the
upfront costs of setting that

655
00:32:58.430 --> 00:33:01.310
up in order to be
so much more free and

656
00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:03.440
available for the things you
want to do. Right. And

657
00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:05.390
it's not, we're not trying
to make people feel guilty

658
00:33:05.390 --> 00:33:08.090
if they're not productive. Because
remember, remember when we said

659
00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:10.370
a moment ago, it's not
about making money or being

660
00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:13.310
productive. It's about optimizing for
what you want. So to

661
00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:17.510
be clear, if binge watching
a show on Netflix, feed

662
00:33:17.510 --> 00:33:19.420
your spirit and you want
to do it, do it,

663
00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:21.980
you should do it, but
you do it intentionally. You

664
00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:24.740
shouldn't just accidentally watch. Oh,
I wish I was supposed

665
00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:26.270
to do this thing for
work. And I accidentally watched

666
00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:29.210
eight hours of Netflix. Yeah,
that's a problem. But I'm

667
00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:31.400
going to treat myself and
this weekend, I'm going to

668
00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:33.590
watch this Netflix show and
I don't feel bad at

669
00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:36.980
all. Exactly. That's the Headspace
that you want to be

670
00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:39.320
in. Is that not feeling
good at all? Yeah, absolutely.

671
00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:43.430

much. Ty. Fujimura CEO of
