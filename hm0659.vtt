17
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.630
Hi, this is Scott Hanselman.
This is another episode of

18
00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.600
Hansel minutes today. I'm talking
with dr. Hannah. Oh, Dasher.

19
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.600
She's a PhD in cognitive
neuroscience and a data scientist

20
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.600
working at Microsoft on something
that was just so exciting.

21
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.570
I wanted to have you
on the show. I'm doing

22
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.600
well. Hi Scott. Nice to
meet you. I'm super excited

23
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.550
to be here. Yeah, this
is going to be great.

24
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.170
So I learned recently about
this idea of play fab,

25
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.170
PLA Y F a B
it's a game back end

26
00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.010
as a service. So this
is a, this is amazing.

27
00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.710
Like if I make a
game, I know I have

28
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.640
to like set up like
sign in and maybe, maybe

29
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.640
I can do a, a
top 10 leaderboard, but I

30
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.380
you're telling me I'm going
to spend a lot of

31
00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.020
time, like making the backend
when I really just want

32
00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.410
to make the game. Right.
Yeah. So PlayFab provides a

33
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.680
complete cloud base backend as
a service for games. So

34
00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.660
like, if you think like
traditionally how games were used

35
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.540
to just sold and operate,
you know, like you would

36
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.510
just go to a store
and buy like a game

37
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.450
and that the content never
changes. And you know, like

38
00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.880
you were kind of like
playing a stationary game that

39
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.060
over and over again. Right.
And, but now more and

40
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.210
more games are actually being
operated services and you can

41
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.870
even consider games as an
ongoing conversation with customers. So

42
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.050
for example, games can launch
live events and send out

43
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.080
push notifications, or even react
to certain player actions in

44
00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.960
real time. And this is
not uncommon, right? You download

45
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.190
mobile games and most games
nowadays duty stinks. And on

46
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.250
the other end of the
spectrum, sometimes game sank crash,

47
00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.170
which used to be the
end of the game life

48
00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.500
cycle. But now they can
actually quickly roll back without

49
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.770
really affecting much of their
player base. And we're getting

50
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.020
updates constantly. Like on my
phone, I might see a

51
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.240
game update once a month
or even once a week.

52
00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.650
Yeah. And you know, like
it's, the backend services actually

53
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.650
are not visible, but all
of these, like try to

54
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.480
operate your game active requires
extensive backend infrastructure, such as,

55
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.520
you know, CRM, marketing automation,
content, automation, commerce system, customer

56
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.600
support, big data analytics and
localization tools along with all

57
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.750
the other end game features
such as leaderboards and matchmaking.

58
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.080
And, you know, to effectively
operate a game, it's not

59
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.900
just about building these tools
independently, but all of these

60
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.620
tools need to talk to
each other. That seems like

61
00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.010
it's like as a game
developer, the least interesting part

62
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.200
of it, but it's also
going to be like the

63
00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.930
base of this pyramid or
the underneath of a giant

64
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.960
iceberg. Like I'll spend 20%
of the game, but I'm

65
00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.580
really gonna need a lot
of work if I want

66
00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.970
to succeed. And ideally the
customer will never see it.

67
00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.010
They'll just have a great
experience with a backend that

68
00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.850
they'll never know exists. Right?
Yeah. So Plato operates is

69
00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.570
like backend services, specialized for
games offering, you know, extensive

70
00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.940
cloud based tools and covering
all the things that I

71
00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.110
mentioned just now, like all
platforms like PC mobile, Xbox

72
00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.470
PlayStation, or Nintendo, you name
it. And it is a

73
00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.130
very cost effective way to,
to start launching and operating

74
00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.030
your games and, you know,
enable developers can so that

75
00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:14.730
they can focus on making
their games fun better than

76
00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.880
focusing on stressing out about
building their backend in front.

77
00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.480
So how much do you
think that most game developers

78
00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.300
are spending on the front
end versus the back end

79
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.450
these days? Well, I'll, don't
have the exact answer, but

80
00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.990
you know, typically game developers
used to spend like years

81
00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.140
in making games and upon
release their job was considered

82
00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.980
done. But nowadays we see
some of our customers spending

83
00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.100
maybe as little as eight
weeks building a game, and

84
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.250
then many years of fixing,
improving and operating their game.

85
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.270
So many successful games today
spend as much time and

86
00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.790
effort operating their live game
as they did to bring

87
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.920
it to the market. Interesting.
And they have to keep

88
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.820
that game up and keep
it running 24 seven. They

89
00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.770
have to babysit the game
and make sure that it's

90
00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.350
like, there's dev ops now
for games. Right, Right, right.

91
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.160
Right. So yes, a lot
of mobile developers, especially like

92
00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.800
indie studios, like we see
them like launching a very

93
00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.950
MVP and lean version of
the games first and then

94
00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.980
sort of like improving as
their customer base increases and,

95
00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.980
you know, getting their feedback
and, you know, just, just

96
00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.700
continuously operating and improving and,
and make sure that they're

97
00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:24.630
actually kind of like going
to a more like flip

98
00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.920
fledged product than sort of
like staying at that MVP

99
00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:34.080
stage. Now you have a,
a PhD in cognitive neuroscience.

100
00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.440
Is that like how the
brain works? Yeah. So I

101
00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.500
actually spent about 10 years
sort of like studying how

102
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.610
people operate, like kind of
ranging from, you know, vegan

103
00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:48.000
kind of looking into how
people perceive motion and depth,

104
00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.210
like using like a very
sort of like initial version

105
00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:55.230
of BR goggles. And then
my PhD work was more

106
00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.340
related to sort of like,
how, how do people make

107
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.100
decisions? How do people learn
from the environment? So I

108
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.910
actually sort of like studied
how people do reinforcement learning,

109
00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.830
not the machines do reinforcement
learning, you know? Hmm. Now

110
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.440
is reinforcement learning. That's something
certainly where I can go

111
00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.780
and learn a topic and
I can understand what the

112
00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:15.880
best way to teach something
is, but can that be

113
00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.270
then applied to like making
an online game better and

114
00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:22.090
making someone happier when they're
doing something that isn't necessarily

115
00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:24.940
learning? Well, it's sort of
like an kind of like

116
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.420
optimal, like you could actually
certainly use it to optimize

117
00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:31.990
the, your machine basically. So
the whole, whole theory behind

118
00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:35.740
reinforcement learning is that like
the, the, you know, the

119
00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:39.340
information in our, our environment
is kind of probabilistic, meaning

120
00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:43.810
that we don't necessarily get
a very stationary conclusions based

121
00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:46.060
on the decision that we
make every day. Even like,

122
00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:48.520
imagine you're sort of like
driving your car, trying to

123
00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:52.390
merge into a very busy
highway and you actually have

124
00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:55.120
to have a lot of
info information to actually emerge

125
00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:58.510
without crashing into another car.
And humans do this like

126
00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:01.990
really fast. I'm fairly easily.
If you're like a pretty

127
00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:07.450
advanced driver and machines actually
tend to fail a lot

128
00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:11.530
if, and given a same
situation. So it's certainly sort

129
00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:14.620
of like interesting kind of
like how people sort of

130
00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:18.460
like launched their experience, optimized
their decision, making skills, and

131
00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:22.090
then apply it in a
real world situation. Hmm. So

132
00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:25.630
reinforcement learning is how it's
also how people learn, but

133
00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:27.730
it's also how computers learn,
like in the machine learning

134
00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:29.890
context. Oh, you have to,
you have to run an

135
00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:33.160
agent through a process and
then hopefully they'll change their

136
00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.620
state based on some rewards
that they're given by their

137
00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:38.770
scenario. Right? Yeah. So the
reward is like the very

138
00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:43.000
sort of like a signal
that actually makes machines to

139
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.320
learn and optimize those skills
or sort of like value,

140
00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:51.820
which information is more important
in driving car, better decisions

141
00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:55.330
over the other, I guess.
Now if we plot, if

142
00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:58.420
we apply that to, to,
to a game or to

143
00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:01.840
a piece of software, is
that enabling the, the user

144
00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.810
then to achieve their goal
more, have more fun while

145
00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:07.180
they're doing it than anything,
you know, they open their,

146
00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:10.060
whatever it is, their loot
box or their next, their

147
00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:13.270
next achievement in the game.
And then the cycle continues.

148
00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:17.170
Yeah. Certainly it's sort of
like, you can actually kind

149
00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:20.080
of use that, like use
that algorithm to sort of

150
00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:23.950
like make the games more
fun and make the experience

151
00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:27.490
more engaging for users. So
if we're, if someone's listening

152
00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:29.590
to this show and maybe
they've thought about making a

153
00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:32.800
game or in the past,
they've, they've already made a

154
00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:35.050
game of put one out
there. They might be thinking,

155
00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:37.300
wow, this is an awful
lot of science. And, and,

156
00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.490
and PhD's to, to just,
I just want to make

157
00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:42.550
a fun game, but this
is proven to make games

158
00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:45.550
better, right? Like you, you
are making games more fun

159
00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:47.680
and making people stick around
and play them longer. When

160
00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.740
you think about science in
this way. Right? The whole

161
00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:53.830
goal of data scientists, especially
on gaming is to make

162
00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:58.080
games were fun, you know,
with the goal of improving

163
00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:01.110
acquisition, engagement and retention of
the player of your playbook

164
00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:06.360
player base. So basically, I
mean like a lot of

165
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.760
people think that data science
is like, you know, just

166
00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.640
kinda collecting and tracking some
well-known metrics, such as, you

167
00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:15.030
know, number of new installs,
monthly, daily, active users, their

168
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:18.360
retention game revenue, or even
crush rates that can actually

169
00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:22.170
help developers to track performance
after games. But it's not

170
00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:24.660
really limited to that. I
mean, if you have a

171
00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:26.790
really good set of data
scientist, you can do way

172
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:31.520
more interesting things with, with
the resources. That's a really

173
00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:34.490
good point. So you are
a data science with a

174
00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:38.420
particular background. Yours is in
cognitive neuroscience. You're not just

175
00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:40.170
going to sit there and
say, Oh, look, we have

176
00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:42.890
a, this many percent retention
rate. If we change this,

177
00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:45.890
we'll retain more. Right. You
can go far beyond that

178
00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:48.950
and understand why people do
what they do and push

179
00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:51.410
them forward in the game.
Yeah. I mean, if you

180
00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:54.050
think about it, there are
so many different reasons. Play

181
00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:57.170
people play games. I mean,
some people seek new experience.

182
00:09:57.170 --> 00:10:00.230
Some people play to socialize
with others and some people

183
00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:04.040
just simply play to kill
time. And, you know, modern

184
00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:06.590
games like the player base
is also kind of like

185
00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:09.650
coming from many different parts
of the world. And they

186
00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:12.740
may come from very diverse
cultural backgrounds and they may

187
00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:16.040
also be comprised of wide
range of age groups. And

188
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:19.280
as you can imagine, like
player behavior differs widely across

189
00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:22.490
diverse groups and you can
certainly use data science to

190
00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:27.230
identify like does different player
groups characterize how different or

191
00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:30.440
similar they are in their
activity patterns and detect which

192
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:33.230
part of the game players
are most engaged or even

193
00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:36.470
at which point players often
struggle and likely decide to

194
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:38.810
quit playing the games. And
all of these is just

195
00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:42.200
to sort of like improving
the quality of the product

196
00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:45.080
as well as sort of
like games from the player

197
00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:49.970
side game, making gameplay experience
more fun and engaging. Hmm.

198
00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:53.930
So when we think about
how a person engages with

199
00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:57.590
a game, you're sending whatever
telemetry you as the game

200
00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:00.350
developer chooses to, to the
back end in this case,

201
00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:02.840
it might be PlayFab. So
it could be, you know,

202
00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:06.590
user entered a new area,
user did something in their

203
00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:09.050
inventory. It's really up to
you as the game developer

204
00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:11.720
decide what you want to
capture in order to make

205
00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:15.020
the decision about what later
will be chewed up as

206
00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:18.620
a, as data and the
data science side. Right? So,

207
00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:21.980
I mean like game developers
know dare games the best,

208
00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:25.820
right? So data scientists can
certainly work with developers to

209
00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:29.000
actually let's say like, okay,
these are the good telemetry

210
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.190
events that you need to
implement in the game to

211
00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:34.820
measure, you know, like where
players are most engaged or

212
00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:38.030
where they're failing, or whether
the tutorials very helpful or

213
00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:40.880
not, you know, things like
that. And then become work

214
00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:43.550
with the developers to tune
their games with the optimal

215
00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:48.290
parameters, to provide more tailored
experience for disperse player groups

216
00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:51.560
or even for an individual
player. Hmm. So when this

217
00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:56.140
gets pulled into the PlayFab
backend, the game back end

218
00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:59.830
as a service, then we,
we, as the, the dev

219
00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:02.380
ops, people in the game
can, can chew that data,

220
00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:04.960
look at that data and
then apply whatever we want

221
00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:07.360
to, to, to confirm or
deny our assumptions about how

222
00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:11.580
people move around the game.
That's our goal. So we

223
00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:13.620
are still at an early
stage and we are sort

224
00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:17.820
of like trying to help
developers to make these telemetrics

225
00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:21.450
decisions better, help, help them
to better interpret their data.

226
00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:26.280
And we can also try
to optimize the, our backend

227
00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:30.300
system to easily push out
different contents, different store offerings,

228
00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:33.840
or even different gameplay experience
based on what we found

229
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:38.760
in the data I see.
And because the game front

230
00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:41.100
end can be changed and
the back end is always

231
00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:44.670
being improved. We might be
able to discover things farther

232
00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:48.090
along in the process that
may not exist today. Right.

233
00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:50.700
And then, you know, again,
to Rose can make changes

234
00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:54.120
to their games, update or
contents, and which refer to

235
00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:57.330
as live ops. And it's
like providing customized experience for

236
00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:01.880
each player so that they
can continue to engage. The,

237
00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:04.320
the idea of real time
is really interesting because we're

238
00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:07.530
not just chewing on data
from like last week and

239
00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:10.800
all the sessions last week.
You can literally say, you

240
00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:13.110
know, the people in India
are waking up right now

241
00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:15.180
and they're starting to enter
the game. So now, because

242
00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:17.730
of the time of day,
you know, we're really hot

243
00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:20.310
in this time zone and
those people are coming in

244
00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:22.830
and that, like you said
before, they might be treating

245
00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:25.260
the game differently than someone
in another country. And we

246
00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:28.290
can give them a better
experience. Yeah. I mean, for

247
00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:31.470
example, I mean, since it's
October, let's imagine that you

248
00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:33.870
are running, trying to run
a Halloween event, right? Like

249
00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:36.750
introducing special themes on items
in the game. And you

250
00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:39.840
see so many games do
this nowadays, right? And so

251
00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:41.640
it might be a really
good idea to launch the

252
00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:44.340
event. Only the countries just
celebrate Halloween like the U

253
00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:48.090
S and you can also
try to widely announce events

254
00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:50.370
and you might want to
send out a push or

255
00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:54.420
email notification to players in
this countries. And you can't

256
00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:57.570
even offer like special Halloween
discounts only to a group

257
00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:00.330
of your most, you know,
Royal players. Who's been active

258
00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:03.030
in your game for a
long period of time, or

259
00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:05.070
have spent a large amount
of money in your game.

260
00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:08.910
And then to go one
step further to make things

261
00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:12.030
more interesting. You can also
set some limited time achievements.

262
00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:14.670
So for example, collecting a
rare set of items to

263
00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:18.330
unlock a hidden level or
special rewards, or have a

264
00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:21.570
realtime leaderboards that show progress
amongst a group of friends.

265
00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:25.290
Hmm. I never even thought
it's such an obvious thing

266
00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:27.360
to say now that you've
said it, but the idea

267
00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:29.460
that I would not want
to do a worldwide Halloween

268
00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:32.550
push, if a country doesn't
celebrate it or doesn't even

269
00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:35.100
care, Right. It's not going
to be relevant for their

270
00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:37.710
experience, right? Like you might
want to target different types

271
00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:40.680
of events for the countries
that are not in that

272
00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:43.830
group of countries. You know?
I see. So then we

273
00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:46.470
were segmenting our different player
groups. They're all getting a

274
00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:48.810
different experience. And this is
part of that concept that

275
00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:53.290
you refer to called live
ops. Yeah. And there's code

276
00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:54.940
for all of this. Like
I noticed when I went

277
00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:56.590
up to get hub that
they had to get hub

278
00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:00.340
for PlayFab, there's a game
like a full game called

279
00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:02.440
unicorn battle that like has
examples of how to do

280
00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:04.990
this kind of stuff. Yeah.
I mean, the unicorn battle

281
00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:06.850
is like, sort of like
already example game kind of

282
00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:11.410
showing off our, you know,
capabilities using our PlayFab backend.

283
00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:14.740
And you can do really
interesting things. You can push

284
00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:18.910
out like a new store
offerings your two year, like

285
00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:22.150
to your specified segments in
a real time or change

286
00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:25.750
the content, you know, or
even like update like player

287
00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:28.630
status just in real time,
just using a few simple

288
00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:32.200
button clicks. So there's like,
there's end game promotions that

289
00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:34.720
we talked about. And there's
like, you know, cross promoting,

290
00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.190
if someone did something and
you want to let them

291
00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:38.620
know about something else that's
going on, but also the

292
00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:41.830
obvious things like leaderboards, but
messaging and DLC as well.

293
00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:45.970
Right? So like live off
strategies is just a collection

294
00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:49.240
of strategists for, for games
to continue to connect and

295
00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:53.110
develop deep relationships with players
for the long haul and

296
00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:56.080
all that, the goal that
improved acquisition engagement and retention.

297
00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:59.710
And we see all the
time that at an effective

298
00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:02.380
live of strategy can make
the difference between success and

299
00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:05.860
failure for a modern game.
And, you know, sometimes it

300
00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:09.790
can even turn games into
forever franchises. Yeah. That's an

301
00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:11.890
interesting thing. There are games
that I have had for

302
00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:14.320
years that you would think
would not be fresh anymore,

303
00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:16.720
but they are changing. They
are growing and they are

304
00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:19.630
different. So I keep coming
back to them. So it's

305
00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:23.470
like a new challenge, new,
new content update and, you

306
00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:25.750
know, new events. Those are
all sort of like very

307
00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:28.750
helpful in acquiring your players
and as well as like

308
00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:34.690
providing new content and interesting
challenges to existing players, Today's

318
00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:18.490
of this, from my perspective,
as the consumer is I

319
00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:20.920
want to be happy and
enjoy myself. And then from

320
00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:22.810
the point of view of
the game maker, they want

321
00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:24.850
their people to be happy,
but they also want them

322
00:17:24.850 --> 00:17:28.120
to remain players. They want
them to be, to be

323
00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:33.330
satisfied. And I was reading
your, your PhD thesis. And

324
00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:37.150
I saw a word I
did not recognize called satisficing.

325
00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:40.690
Right? What is that? That,
that's an awesome word. I

326
00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:44.950
know it's a portmanteau of
something. What does satisficing, It's

327
00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:47.890
a sort of like a
made up world word, like

328
00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:50.280
a proposed by Herbert Simon
who actually won a Nobel

329
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:55.260
prize in economics back in
1980s or something. And it's

330
00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:58.800
sort of like a merge
of two different words, satisfied

331
00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:03.540
plus suffice. So people are,
are like in the real

332
00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:06.420
world, like it's actually really,
really difficult to make an

333
00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:08.970
optimal decision. And I'm not
even sure if there's such

334
00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:12.000
thing as optimal decision given
the sort of like unknown

335
00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:17.190
uncertainties and probabilities of the
information. So it's sort of

336
00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:20.280
like a word that used
to describe how people make

337
00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:24.960
decisions based on heuristics. So
people tend to make decisions

338
00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:28.110
that's kind of good enough
or so five to satisfy

339
00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:32.570
their, their threshold. Okay. So
they're not necessarily making optimal

340
00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:36.200
but decisions, but they are
making reasonable decisions that meet

341
00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:41.390
a certain bar or level
of quality they suffice. Yes.

342
00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:44.060
And that's, that's what enables
sort of like a quick

343
00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:46.220
decision, you know, like if
you go to walk into

344
00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:48.230
a grocery store and you're
attracted, pick up a peanut

345
00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:51.290
butter, there are so many
different peanut butter brands and,

346
00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:54.410
you know, like there petition
differently, their labels are different.

347
00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:57.560
And how do you know
whether you actually pick the

348
00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:01.190
optimal peanut butter for yourself?
Yeah. Okay. So I'm applying

349
00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:03.380
this to games. I know
that very often I'll be

350
00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:06.080
running through a dungeon and
I'll get a new sword

351
00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:08.210
or a new shield and
I'll go, Oh, I don't

352
00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:10.640
have enough information to decide
if this is the right

353
00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:12.110
one or the best one,
but I just want the

354
00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:15.200
best one. And then I'm
forced to make some, what

355
00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:17.930
I feel is suboptimal decision.
And then I have to

356
00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:19.820
run forward with a, you
know, some sort of made

357
00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:21.230
of paper. I'm not sure
if it's the right one.

358
00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:25.250
Yeah. But interesting thing is
like, humans are actually extremely

359
00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:29.120
good at making this type
of heuristic decisions that are

360
00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:32.690
close to optimal, which is
kind of surprising. Interesting. So

361
00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:35.690
how is this different from
making a decision based on

362
00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:39.800
your gut? It's very similar
idea, actually. So people often

363
00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:42.470
describe it just as a
gut decision making as well.

364
00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:46.130
So when I was doing
my PhD, I was also

365
00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:48.740
looking into brain activities involved
in this type of decisions

366
00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:52.280
versus something that was actually
overlearned and odd and sort

367
00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:55.940
of like making optimal decisions.
And, you know, like this

368
00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:59.030
type of heuristic decision making
actually takes very little time

369
00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:03.110
and also involves less of
prefrontal cortex, which is known

370
00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:07.520
to be involved in making
more logical reasoning and sort

371
00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:11.360
of like more information based
decisions. Okay. So if I'm

372
00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:13.850
making a gut decision or
if I feel like my,

373
00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:15.830
you know, my chest rather
than the front of my

374
00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:18.440
head is helping me make
the decision, what part of

375
00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:20.120
the brain is lit up
or is it even being

376
00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:23.600
used to make those decisions?
So it's the part of

377
00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:26.750
the brain that I found
was called striatum. It's actually,

378
00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:29.930
I'm heavily involved in reinforcement
learning as well. So if

379
00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:33.530
you're sort of like learning
through experience and then you're

380
00:20:33.530 --> 00:20:36.440
kind of like making the
choice without really kind of

381
00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:40.130
logically going through what reasoning
steps that you're taking, then

382
00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:43.670
just part of the brain
actually lights up pretty intensely.

383
00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:47.620
And this is also very
heavily, like very closely to

384
00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:51.250
model reactions as well. So
it actually triggers faster motor

385
00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:53.940
response. Interesting. That makes me
feel like if I was

386
00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:56.250
playing a very twitchy game,
then that would be the

387
00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:58.590
brain that would be involved
in making those quick decisions

388
00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:00.720
where I don't even feel
like I'm making a decision,

389
00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:03.840
but I probably am. Right.
Like first person shooter game.

390
00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:06.960
It's like all about motor
reactions. Right. You're not actually

391
00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:09.600
kind of going thinking through,
Oh, like saying like, Oh,

392
00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:12.090
I detected an enemy right
there and I'm going to

393
00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:17.940
use this machine to optimally
kill that person. Okay. So

394
00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:22.200
in the game of course
indicate. Yeah. Interesting. Okay. So,

395
00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:24.420
but there are, there are,
there are things that exist.

396
00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:26.970
There are theories and frameworks
around like how people move

397
00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:30.570
through the world and there's
theories like, like rational choice

398
00:21:30.570 --> 00:21:33.750
theory that propose that users
have a certain preference and

399
00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:37.710
they can make an basically
an educated decision. How does

400
00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:41.160
sufficing relate to the theory
that you can make decisions

401
00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:44.580
with appropriate information and have
an opinion? Well, I mean,

402
00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:48.870
our brain stores so much
data and we have abundance

403
00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:53.200
of memory from built from
infancy to childhood to, to

404
00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:56.760
up until adulthood. Right? So
we have this abundance of

405
00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:01.680
information that actually pre-trained us
to, you know, make decisions

406
00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:06.600
that are fairly rational and
we develop preference. And if

407
00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:09.390
you are actually sort of
like making a very simple

408
00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:16.410
choices, like, I don't know,
simple choice cookies, cookies, right.

409
00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:19.050
You have a clear preference.
If you're kinda like given

410
00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:22.680
a choice between chocolate chip
cookie versus potato chips, you

411
00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:26.520
probably have pretty good, good,
you know, like preference to

412
00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:31.050
which one you like. So
that's, to your standpoint, that's

413
00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:33.690
probably a rational choice to
make. And that's fairly easy

414
00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:36.450
choice to make because you
already have a clear preference,

415
00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:39.960
but if you are sort
of like, if you actually

416
00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:44.070
joined, you know, a new
workspace or like you got

417
00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:47.070
a new job, like people
sort of like, don't know

418
00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:49.650
how to act or for
a couple of days, you

419
00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:52.710
know, like don't know how
to interact well. Or when

420
00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:55.320
I first joined Microsoft, I
was having so much trouble,

421
00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:58.350
you know, just kind of
like adapting to using outlook.

422
00:22:58.380 --> 00:22:59.880
You know, I didn't know
how to book a meeting

423
00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:03.540
room and that, those, those
things, you know, like I

424
00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:07.500
learned very fast, but like,
you know, it's, it's, it's,

425
00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:10.590
it's a steep learning curve.
It is, it is, there's

426
00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:12.240
a, this, this is a
little bit random, but there's

427
00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:14.070
a show. One of my
favorite TV shows is called

428
00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:16.230
the good place. And I
don't know if you've ever

429
00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:19.620
seen it before. Okay. You
know how cheaty on the

430
00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:22.680
good place has troubles with
decisions. And there was an

431
00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:25.170
episode last week where he
was trying to decide if

432
00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:27.660
he wanted a blueberry muffin
or another kind of muffin.

433
00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:29.760
And he finally came up
with it. I can, man,

434
00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:31.860
I'm gonna have a blueberry
muffin. And then he learned

435
00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:34.980
that the farmers that made
the blueberries were like oppressed

436
00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:38.010
and he received way more
information than he needed. And

437
00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:40.800
he no longer could make
an optimal decision. And he

438
00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:43.920
was choosing to make optimal
decisions rather than trying to

439
00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:47.720
make satisfactory ones. And it
ultimately kind of destroyed him.

440
00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:50.080
He was unable to make
any decision at all. Yeah.

441
00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:52.780
Cause we are constantly surrounded
by uncertainties of the world.

442
00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:56.740
Like there's no guarantee that
like the today's blueberry method,

443
00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:59.980
we will guarantee the quality
of tomorrow's blueberry muffin. Yeah.

444
00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:02.350
And any, any cereal that
you eat today will probably

445
00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:08.260
cause cancer in rats tomorrow.
Yeah, baby. Yeah. Okay. So

446
00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:12.130
people are trying to evaluate
like all the available information,

447
00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:15.130
both subconsciously and consciously, and
they're using different parts of

448
00:24:15.130 --> 00:24:19.030
their brains to make decisions.
And if we apply what

449
00:24:19.030 --> 00:24:22.090
we know about how people
move through life, we can

450
00:24:22.090 --> 00:24:24.430
presume that they'll move similar
leads through the game. And

451
00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:27.610
I assume we can make
even like AB tests or

452
00:24:27.610 --> 00:24:30.070
test these theories as people
move through our games to

453
00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:32.680
see if we offer them
something, they'll be excited about

454
00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:35.830
it or they'll shun it.
Yeah. I mean like that's

455
00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:39.310
the sort of like the,
the critical thing about having

456
00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:42.640
live ops strategy. So like
it's not just about like

457
00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:45.190
running a live ops events,
it's more critical to assess

458
00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:47.560
the effect of the strategy
after the event, you know?

459
00:24:47.890 --> 00:24:50.920
So you want to evaluate
like what percentage of players

460
00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:54.220
actually engage or like, was
it effective in attracting new

461
00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:56.800
players? Did it bring back
lapse players or was it

462
00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:00.040
growth helpful in growing revenue?
All these questions are interesting

463
00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:02.560
and it's sort of like
a, you know, it's an

464
00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:06.010
iterative process of sort of
like forming your optimal strategy

465
00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:10.090
in some sense. And in
your paper, in your thesis,

466
00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:13.000
you talk about decision making
in small worlds, in large

467
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.150
worlds. And in the real
world, I assume a game

468
00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:19.480
as a small world Game
is a small world, depending

469
00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:22.810
on how developers choose to
design it. So if it's,

470
00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:26.320
if it's super Mario, for
example, like Mar like you

471
00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:29.560
probably know the consequence of
like hitting the brake or

472
00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:33.940
like, you know, getting hit
by the floor and stuff

473
00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:36.940
like that. But I mean,
some developers actually choose to

474
00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:40.840
make their games somewhat probabilistic.
So like the same game

475
00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:44.500
action does not really result
in the same game reaction.

476
00:25:45.130 --> 00:25:47.950
And that is actually sort
of like more of a

477
00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:51.940
large world scenario. Oh, okay.
So a massively multiplayer game

478
00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:55.180
or a game that is
persistent or lives, lives forever

479
00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:57.610
with thousands or millions of
people in it is going

480
00:25:57.610 --> 00:25:59.710
to be in fact, a
large world and feel much

481
00:25:59.710 --> 00:26:03.790
different. Yeah. Interesting. Interesting. So
then to, how much time

482
00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:06.160
do you think people should
put into understanding these things

483
00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:08.200
are running these experiments as
they try to make their

484
00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:12.510
game successful? I mean, for
running experiments, there's certainly set

485
00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:15.340
to school theories that actually
measures, you know, a number

486
00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:18.730
of sample sizes, how long
the experiment should run and

487
00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:21.640
stuff like that. But I
mean, this is an iterative

488
00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:25.030
process, as long as it's
the games alive, then, I

489
00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:27.910
mean, this is the data
science should be involved all

490
00:26:27.910 --> 00:26:30.340
the time. So you should
always be having experiments and

491
00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:32.710
always be trying to learn
more about how your players

492
00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:35.530
play your game and how
they enjoy your game. Right.

493
00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:39.340
Yeah. So it's just kinda
like going back to the

494
00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:44.220
live ops theory that, you
know, it's just about continuously

495
00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:48.500
improving your product so that
it stays relevant. And you

496
00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:50.360
said that this is just
kind of getting started at

497
00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:52.730
PlayFab is just going to
be integrating itself into the

498
00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:55.580
Microsoft ecosystem. Is this something
people can sign up for

499
00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:57.980
and learn about now? Are
people people are using this

500
00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:01.580
now today, right? Yes. I
mean, we have thousands of

501
00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:04.520
developers who are already using
PlayFab and you can simply

502
00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:08.750
try it out@playfab.com by signing
up and it's free, it's

503
00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:12.650
free service until you reach
thousand Mau and yeah. So

504
00:27:12.650 --> 00:27:15.470
feel free to try it
out. And You just said

505
00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:18.950
a thousand mile Thousand monthly
active player is sort of

506
00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:22.690
like our, our business model
of saying, okay, you are,

507
00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:25.700
your game has significant users.
So it may be, you

508
00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:29.090
might consider paying it. I
see. So that's Mau, mult,

509
00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:34.910
you know, Mao is what
active users, users, monthly active

510
00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:37.190
users. So if I make
a niche game or I'm

511
00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:39.830
getting started testing my game
or trying it out, it

512
00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:41.630
is free. And then at
some point when I hit

513
00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:45.530
the limit, I should consider,
consider paying. And there's a

514
00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:48.200
free guide as well. It's
like a whole document that

515
00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:52.010
is you can download the
PDF. That explains what live

516
00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:54.020
ops is and how that
strategy can, can help your

517
00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:56.900
game succeed. Yes. It's on

out and see and learn
about live boss event. Hmm.

521
00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:08.480
And this plugs into any
engine, right? Like I'm a.net

522
00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:11.330
developer. So I use unity
and I can make Xbox

523
00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:14.990
games or whatever PlayFab works
anywhere basically on any engine.

524
00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:18.440
Yeah, exactly. So I can
use it on a phone

525
00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:20.240
as well. And you have
people doing that as well.

526
00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:23.420
Yeah. You can change like
game settings on your phone.

527
00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:26.930
We have a backend UI
that actually enables you to

00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:31.580
just update the contents using
any web browser. So yeah,
