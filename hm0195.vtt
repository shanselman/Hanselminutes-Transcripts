00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.740
web developer and technologists, Scott
Hanselman. This is Lawrence Ryan announcing

Scott talks about the Wix

7
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.540
project with project lead. Rob
mentioned. Hi, this is Scott

8
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.850
Hanselman, and this is another
episode of Hansel minutes. And

9
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.940
I'm chatting today with Rob
mentioned, who is the project

10
00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.970
lead for the Wix project?
The waste project is an

11
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.600
installer application that is open
source and it has had

12
00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.520
a public within the longest
open source projects that I've

13
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.430
seen running around Microsoft. How
are you Rob doing well

14
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.950
doing well. So this has
been going on for a

15
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.020
long time. Well, let's just
start at the beginning and

16
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.280
w what is Wix and
when did it start? So

17
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.270
the Wix tool set is
a set of tools that

18
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.370
build windows, installation packages. So
MSI files. We, the idea

19
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.320
is that you take source
code, which happens to be

20
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.500
XML. You feed it into
a compiler and a linker

21
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:31.970
much the same way as
you feed, you know, C

22
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.160
plus plus code into a
C you know, the component

23
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.130
linker and out the other
end pops on MSI that

24
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.110
has all of your files
cabbed up. If you want

25
00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.300
that, all the stuff laid
out such that you can

26
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.430
take that, put it on
a CD and ship with

27
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.550
your customers, tape that put
on the internet, flow to

28
00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.930
your customers and things like
that. And the idea originally

29
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.030
came from the fact that
we had all these tools

30
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.820
that were very focused on
gooey, and you had to

31
00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.530
go in and point and
click on things, but they

32
00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.990
didn't necessarily fit real well
into the development process. That

33
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.650
was typical inside Microsoft at
that time. And by the

34
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:09.110
way, we're talking 1999 when
I started this 99. Yeah.

35
00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.280
That's when I, I graduated
university and joined Microsoft in

36
00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.000
99. So the Wix tool
set was different because it

37
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.940
was check these command line
tools into your build system,

38
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.090
have a make file. They
make file. Cause that's what

39
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.610
we're using back then, and
then have them driven in

40
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.290
the same way with source
control and all that kinds

41
00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.590
of good stuff. A little
bit later, I think it

42
00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.810
was about 2003. We had
a guy joined us and

43
00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.270
said, how about I get
visual studio integration? So he

44
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.210
started the work to create
what we call votive, which

45
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.240
is the visual studio integration
package that gives us all

46
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.240
the build goodness and stuff
like that. And over time,

47
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.680
we've kept up with the
source control text files that

48
00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.230
are built by these command
line tools. Then we added

49
00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.990
Emma's build tasks and more
visual studio integration and so

50
00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.960
on and so forth. So
that's where we've come from.

51
00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.000
Our next thing is keeping
up with the state of

52
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.020
art of installation is people
are not shipping one in

53
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.420
Messiah anymore. They're shipping by
their MSI and they need

54
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.540
a.net framework, or they need
msi.net for American SQL express

55
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.060
or MSX ML. And all
these different packages can no

56
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.040
longer be put into a
single thing. So the big

57
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.840
thing that we're releasing in
the next version of the

58
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.560
Wix tool set is not
just visual studio, 2010 support

59
00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.660
when that ships, but also
this thing that we call

60
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.480
a chain or a bootstrapper
that will hook all those

61
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.510
packages together. Again, in a
you'll define a textile sale,

62
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.610
the things you want, the
build process, I'll put all

63
00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.430
these MSIs and then finally
an executable that allows you

64
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.920
to chain all those MSIs
together. So that's what we

65
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.380
are about. Okay. Wow. That
was a 10 year experience

66
00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.970
there. And a minute. So
this is, so this is

67
00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.330
a DSL, it's a domain
specific language for installers. The,

68
00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.980
the XML grammar is, is
your own right? Yes. Yep.

69
00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.100
Okay. So it's completely made
up and is it a,

70
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.200
it's a full fledged language
in the sense that it

71
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.710
has probably a schema associated
with it and does it,

72
00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.410
and it allows you, it
sounds like more granularity really

73
00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.400
over your, your emphasize. Dan
was actually present given the

74
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.730
gooey that was going on,
the gooeys that were available

75
00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.820
at the time. It depends
on the gooeys. Some buoys,

76
00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.100
you know, allows you to
get down to the actual

77
00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.460
table row concepts that are
inside the windows installer, which

78
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:20.370
it's the windows installer files.
The MSI files themselves are

79
00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.020
a little databases. So you
can actually see them as

80
00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:24.360
tables and rows. The goal
of the Wix tool set

81
00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.900
was to abstract away. A
lot of the weirdnesses that

82
00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.460
were in those tables and
rows, and the fact that

83
00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.300
their tables arose because installation
is very hierarchical, which will

84
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.750
map really nicely and XML,
you can imagine. So it

85
00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.350
has all these concerts to
hide away these, some of

86
00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.810
the nastier details, but also
give you full control over

87
00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.360
the windows installer, which was
one of the big key

88
00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.180
things at the time I
was a developer in window

89
00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.970
or in office. And so
I was looking at, Hey,

90
00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.100
this is this gigantic huge
project. How do we do

91
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.620
things to enable this fitting
the build process a bit.

92
00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.690
We have some other features
that allow you to do

93
00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.460
distributed development really well, so
that you can take what

94
00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.770
would be say the office
installation and break it up

95
00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.440
into many small parts where
one, guy's worried about Windward

96
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.690
dot ECC and other guys
worried about like MSO DLL,

97
00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.460
and there's all this calm
registration and things that hook

98
00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.000
together. Each individual developer can
be responsible for their individual

99
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.010
parts and the Wix tool
set through the compiling and

100
00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.860
linking we'll bring it all
back together into one MSI

101
00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.080
or however you want to
organize it. So I'll, it

102
00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.940
is designed to go to
huge scale and, and provide

103
00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:28.980
everything that you can do
in the windows installer. We

104
00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:34.020
support that in the store.
Wow. Okay. So, so your,

105
00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.330
so 10 years ago you
were just out of school

106
00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.450
and you've just, and Microsoft
is your first and only

107
00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:42.510
job is that right? Besides,
you know, I had an

108
00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.970
internship at an engineering firm
when I was in college

109
00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.520
and then I had an
internship at Microsoft in 98

110
00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.250
as well. And then I
came back in 99 And

111
00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.110
then you had this idea
and how did you have

112
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.510
this idea? Like, was this
part of your job where

113
00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.580
you needed to make installers
as part of your job?

114
00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.670
And you said, wow, existing
tool set is unacceptable. So

115
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.450
when I was an intern
on an office where the

116
00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:05.980
wind installer was actually created,
so I was an intern

117
00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:07.960
on the window installer 98.
So I had a little

118
00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.180
bit of background of what
this thing was when I

119
00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.930
started in 99. And I
had created mostly tools around

120
00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.300
the, when installed for my
course. You don't take an

121
00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:17.830
intern and say, here, let's
put you in the middle

122
00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:19.930
of the engine, near the
end of our ship cycle.

123
00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:21.070
And have you just kind
of write code in there.

124
00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:23.380
They don't do that interns.
So instead I got tools.

125
00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.960
How can you make it
easier things to know about

126
00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.090
when, as installers and stuff
like that? So at the

127
00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:32.170
time I created things like
ices, which are the internal

128
00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:33.850
consist evaluators. You can think
of it kind of like

129
00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.250
ethics cop for C-sharp. We
have an X, a static

130
00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:40.450
analysis for MSI files. I
also created Orca and which

131
00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:42.160
is probably one of the
things I'm more famous for,

132
00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.820
which is the assembly level
debugger kind of thing that

133
00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:48.130
you can get into and
see every little piece of

134
00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:52.510
a windows installer file in
that row table format. So

135
00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:58.210
Database editor, it's the Microsoft
access of, of, of installers.

136
00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:02.560
Yes. Of MSI files. Yeah.
And yeah, hardly anybody uses

137
00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.630
it today because I saw
people trying to do this

138
00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:05.860
and, you know, it's like,
Oh, he's got the foreign

139
00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:07.600
key relationships. Right. And you
have to type all this.

140
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.670
Right. I was like, this
is crazy. So that's when

141
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:11.800
I started getting into, well,
you know, there should be

142
00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.050
a high level concept. And
I knew textiles were, you

143
00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:16.120
know, the build process source
control, that kind of stuff

144
00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:21.010
was important thing. And I,
at the time, you know,

145
00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:25.360
we're talking 1999 XDR was
coming out, you know, XML

146
00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.700
with an XDR types things
and DPDs are going away,

147
00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:30.550
but Microsoft is doing STR
this was before XSD anyway.

148
00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.010
So I was like, Oh,
this XML thing, like going,

149
00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:34.210
gonna be good. It's gonna
be a big thing. And

150
00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:36.520
I didn't want to write
a whole parser for my

151
00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:37.960
language. I was like, I'll
just put it next to

152
00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:39.610
the mail. This section will
be a big thing. So

153
00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:41.260
in fact, if you come
to my office, you'll see

154
00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.170
a, my door tag I've
been carrying around since office.

155
00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:46.240
Cause the guys got tired
of hearing me say, I

156
00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.740
think XML is going to
be, this thing will be

157
00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:50.200
really cool. They gave me
a door tag that says,

158
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:53.200
has mentioned as elements had
Rob as the text of

159
00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.740
the element. And that's my
door tag, which of course

160
00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:59.170
is point people like, yeah,
okay. Whatever. But back in

161
00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:01.750
then XML was a big,
you know, new and exciting

162
00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:03.760
kind of thing. So I
took the one installer, took

163
00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.100
XML, put them together into
this project so that I

164
00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:07.840
can learn a lot from
this. And then it turns

165
00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:10.570
into what we have is
the Wix tool set. When

166
00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:13.240
you started this, did you
ask a boss ahead of

167
00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:15.460
time? And again, like not
only was XML in the

168
00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:17.650
kind of the beginning stages,
but I think it would

169
00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:20.380
be fair to say that
that open source, as far

170
00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:24.580
as Microsoft was concerned was
certainly not on their radar.

171
00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:27.700
Were you doing this as
part of your job or

172
00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:30.100
did we do this on
the side? This is a,

173
00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:32.050
so the Wix tool set
has been a side job

174
00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:37.000
for, you know, these 10
years I started because one,

175
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.560
I thought it would be
a good thing for us

176
00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.120
to have, I was going
to learn a lot from

177
00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:43.420
it, but I believed in
this text file build system

178
00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:45.490
for billing solution packages and
that set up could be

179
00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:48.550
developed, distributed across main developers.
I just, I believe in

180
00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:50.140
those things. So this project
was kind of a way

181
00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:53.020
of, you know, taking that
philosophy and saying, look, here's

182
00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:55.950
something you can do. Here's
the goodness you get out

183
00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:57.540
of it. And so I
was running, I mean the

184
00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:00.420
first version was all written
in VB script. So I

185
00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:03.750
mean like Wix V one,
it was all VB script

186
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:06.420
accrued to like 10,000 lines
of VB script code with,

187
00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:08.550
you know, all the WSF
files and stuff like that.

188
00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:11.280
The VB script team loved
me at that time. Cause

189
00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.880
I would stress their engine
I'd file bugs around. So

190
00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:15.400
I'm going, yeah, it doesn't
work when you do this.

191
00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:17.310
And I'm like, Oh, Hey,
it turns out my roommate

192
00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:18.990
later would be one of
the guys that worked on

193
00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:22.980
this scripting. And so anyway,
so it was just an

194
00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:25.050
idea that I had that
we should do this now.

195
00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:29.190
It was a side project
and I had been exposed

196
00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:33.570
very little to open source
just a little bit towards

197
00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:35.280
the end or one of
my friends in college and

198
00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:36.960
could be getting the WN
and stuff like that. And

199
00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.280
I kind of like going,
you know, what is this

200
00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:40.140
about why you got the
source code for free? That's

201
00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:42.810
kind of unique, you know,
this is junior year, whatever.

202
00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:44.310
So it was an interesting
idea. So when I was

203
00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:46.590
at Microsoft, I was like,
well, come inside. It only

204
00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:48.360
makes sense that I'm gonna
work in a society. You're

205
00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.520
going to get the source
code. It's VB script. So

206
00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:52.680
what if I can get
people involved in this project?

207
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:55.860
And I knew it was
open source, but I called

208
00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:57.630
it community source for a
long time. Look, let's build

209
00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:00.450
a community around this thing.
Let's get people talking about

210
00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:01.830
it. Cause I mean, and
we're talking about set up

211
00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:04.050
geeks here, right? So we're
talking about guys that build

212
00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:06.770
winterization packages and stuff like
that. Yeah. I mean, it's,

213
00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:08.420
especially, it's funny that you
point that out though. Let's

214
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:10.250
let's, let's back up for
a second. Cause we are

215
00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:12.320
talking about set up set
of geeks. As you'd like

216
00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.200
to say these are, there's
a special kind of engineer

217
00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:18.770
that really, really enjoys writing
a great setup application. That's

218
00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:20.750
true. I have, I have
a great amount of respect

219
00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:23.780
for those folks, but to
see, to see a good

220
00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:26.870
setup application is, you know,
is a work of art.

221
00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:29.180
And I think it would
be wonderful that to imagine

222
00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:31.490
a world one day when
there is no setup and

223
00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:34.040
then we're just dragging everything
in an applications folder. But

224
00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:37.340
until then a good looking
setup, like a paint.net level

225
00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:40.250
setup is a, is a
really beautiful thing. And so

226
00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.230
I totally agree with you
about that. And so the

227
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:44.510
big thing at that time
was set up. Guys also

228
00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:48.250
don't tend to get much
respect in general, this just

229
00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:49.850
kind of like, yeah, just
go make it happen. Why

230
00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:51.760
isn't this X copy? I'm
like, it's not as copied

231
00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.960
because the systems have been
made harder. The applications made

232
00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:56.960
difficult, not because we like
to make our lives difficult.

233
00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:58.760
And so it was a
nice way to kind of

234
00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:00.680
bring this community together and
go, Hey, there are other

235
00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:03.740
people out here that are
doing the setup stuff. Maybe

236
00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:05.690
we can all make our
lives better by building tools

237
00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:08.360
that help us. And that's
what the waste tool set

238
00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:13.370
has been for these years
and the open source. So

239
00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:15.920
it wasn't open source insight.
I mean it followed all

240
00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:17.720
of the typical things you
get from open source. There's,

241
00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:20.240
you know, there's a code,
you could get it, you'd

242
00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:22.340
send in, you we'd have
a mailing list. People would

243
00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:24.380
talk about it. And it
was all inside the company

244
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:27.050
until the end of 2003.
When I finally got to

245
00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:30.230
a point where I'm like,
okay, I think it's time

246
00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.330
for me to go and
see if I can take

247
00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:34.220
this project. The set of
tools that I think would

248
00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:37.940
be useful for developers outside
the company. And Oh, by

249
00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:40.340
the way, in that time
I'd rewritten the VB script

250
00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:42.620
into C sharp as a
way of learning C sharp.

251
00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:45.200
I had switched teams to
where we need to use

252
00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:46.460
C sharp and I didn't
know it well. So I

253
00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:49.760
took my VB script and
you know, rewrote this gigantic

254
00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:51.710
thing and C sharp in
a couple of weeks. Cause

255
00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:53.030
that's how long they gave
me a ramp up on

256
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:55.660
language. So I rewrote it
like, okay, that's great. And

257
00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:57.340
I was like, with this
C sharp language, I can

258
00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:59.440
take this outside the company
and people could use it.

259
00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:03.340
How do I go about
doing that? And so I

260
00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:05.430
started going through, you know,
every group has a LCR

261
00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:07.060
rep. So I went to
LSA rep and I sat

262
00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.600
down and I said Slow
down because people on the

263
00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:11.760
phone won't people on the
phone rather. It's not. Cause

264
00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:13.770
I'm talking to you on
the phone. People who are

265
00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:15.870
listening to the show, won't
know what LCA is. So

266
00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:19.340
legal and corporate affairs LCA
is what we call the,

267
00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:21.810
the, the, the suits, the
lawyers here at Microsoft. Yeah.

268
00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:27.090
So you actually called you
called the suits. Sure. I

269
00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:29.790
call them because people always
make fun of lawyers and

270
00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:31.950
stuff like that. I love
those guys because once I

271
00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:34.080
figured out what they're doing
is trying to apply what

272
00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:36.420
we do in logic and
coding rules and all that

273
00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:37.500
kind of stuff. They're trying
to apply it to the

274
00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:40.830
English language. It makes it
infinitely harder. But once I

275
00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:42.390
figured that about lawyers, I
was like, okay, I get

276
00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:46.140
you guys. Hey everybody, this
is Scott coming at you

277
00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:48.780
from another place in time.
No doubt. You probably bumped

278
00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:51.780
into testing tasks now, and
then, and your work and,

279
00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:54.060
you know, writing functional tests
is probably not your favorite

280
00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:56.040
thing. It's kind of difficult.
It takes time and the

281
00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.560
results can be dubious. Well,
I'll get ready to start

282
00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:02.220
liking tests. Thanks to Tellerik
with the, the new whereby

283
00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:06.090
testing framework. Building web automation
test is a breeze. You've

284
00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:09.900
got code automation with advanced
asp.net, Ajax and certified applications.

285
00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:12.510
You can write a single
test, have it executed against

286
00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:15.960
multiple browsers at once. You'd
benefit from a rich API

287
00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:19.500
there's link support integration with
visual studio, unit testing, also

288
00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:22.860
end unit X unit and
NBA unit, not to mention

289
00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:25.710
the free rappers for Telerik
rad controls for ESPN and

290
00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:29.280
Ajax and several lines, all
shipping with Telerik's new testing

291
00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:32.730
tool. One of the best
features, the webinar testing framework,

292
00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:35.640
which is developed by art
of test is it's absolutely

293
00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:39.660
free Friday got hooked on
web testing framework, start using

294
00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:43.230
it right away, go to
tellerik.com for more info. Thanks

295
00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:45.540
a lot. Did you just
say that the lawyers are

296
00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:50.880
trying to code with English?
Yes, absolutely. When you get

297
00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:53.580
into, when you get into
the interpretations of what open

298
00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:55.830
source licenses are, you're going
to see all of the

299
00:13:55.830 --> 00:14:01.620
baits are about, about the
placement of punctuation and what

300
00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:04.260
words are used and things
like that. If we have

301
00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:05.860
time, I can tell I'll
tell you something that the

302
00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:08.430
CPL was just kind of
fun. So, anyway, so I

303
00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:12.060
went to the LCA, our
legal rep and said, Hey,

304
00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:14.760
what I'd like to do
is release this code. I

305
00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:16.590
know Microsoft has kind of
been a little bit more

306
00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:20.130
open about releasing code to
the externals. We, some of

307
00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:22.050
the policies in 19 nine
were a lot more, do

308
00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:25.320
not touch open source at
all by 2003, we're starting

309
00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:26.540
to be a little bit
more well, you know, let's

310
00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:28.470
kind of, you know, let's,
let's do some things in

311
00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:30.630
this space. I went to
look, the guy said, okay,

312
00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:32.700
this is kind of the
ULA we put on the

313
00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:34.680
licenses that we put on
it that says, Hey, you

314
00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:37.020
can use this, but Microsoft
doesn't make any guarantees on

315
00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:38.310
it. Stuff like that. I'm
like, okay. Yeah. That's kinda

316
00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:39.990
what I'm looking for. I'd
also like to be able

317
00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:42.870
to like have contributions come
back and the lawyer just

318
00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:44.820
kind of stops and looks
at me and he's like,

319
00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:48.570
you mean like opensource? And
I'm like, yeah, like a

320
00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:50.820
community where we can hang
out and, you know, talk

321
00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:54.680
about and stuff. And he's
like, that's different. I know

322
00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:56.180
a guy that happens to
be working on that kind

323
00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:58.730
of project. So I got
looped to this lawyer. Another

324
00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:01.160
lawyer, I never say his
last name was like Steve

325
00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:02.900
McCalsky or something like that.
He doesn't work on that

326
00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:04.760
space anymore. But at the
time he was like, alright,

327
00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:05.980
I know who you need
to talk to. And they

328
00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:09.050
hook me in with this
business guy that was in

329
00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:11.090
the windows business guy. And
his name was Steven Wally.

330
00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:13.520
And Steven Wallace says, Hey, this
is great. Let's have coffee.

331
00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:15.380
I'm like, okay, we're gonna
have coffee. So I sit

332
00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:17.240
down and I look at
him and he looks at

333
00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:18.860
me and he goes, so
what are you doing? I

334
00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:20.540
tell them the story. I
was like, okay, that's good.

335
00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:22.610
That's good. I was like,
alright, so what do you

336
00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:23.930
wanna do? I'm like, I
want to release this. I

337
00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:25.330
want you to be able
to have countries. I'm gonna

338
00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:27.800
have community outside. It's like,
okay. Okay. That's good. How

339
00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:29.450
much headcount do you want?
And I was like, Hey

340
00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:31.070
cat, you mean like people
to work on this project?

341
00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:34.700
He's like, yeah. And I'm
like, none me and like

342
00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:36.650
four guys are working on
it right now. And you

343
00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:38.750
know, we get together at
my house on Thursday nights

344
00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:41.330
and order pizza and hack
on the code and have

345
00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:43.280
a good time and laugh.
And then, you know, we

346
00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:45.560
do our job during the
day and he's like, perfect.

347
00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:49.430
And so what ends up
happening is I ended up

348
00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:51.890
rolled in. He goes to
my management. We go to

349
00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:54.260
the guys, the management that
has the one installer team.

350
00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.210
They all talk about, Hey,
is this okay? Are you

351
00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:58.070
guys okay if we release
this project, it ends up

352
00:15:58.070 --> 00:16:01.130
going to on Jim Elgin.
And I have this meeting

353
00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:03.350
with Jamal just hour and
a half meeting. They'd been

354
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:05.930
looking for an open source
project to release from Microsoft.

355
00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:07.480
And just to be clear
to the folks that are

356
00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:11.020
listening, Jim, all chin is
important. Jim Olson is the,

357
00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:13.570
at this point in time,
the head of the windows

358
00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:17.590
organization, all of it. And
so he was a very,

359
00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:19.840
you know, important dude. And
we had this meeting and

360
00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:22.060
I'm like sitting here going,
this is crazy. Like, I'm

361
00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:23.710
just a dev, right. I'm
just the guy that writes

362
00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:26.350
code sitting here and Jim
mulches office. And, you know,

363
00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:27.880
they'll look at it. And
like, and there had been

364
00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:29.530
pre-meetings before it was talking
about what they've been looking

365
00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:32.410
for. So Steven Wally talks
about the project a little

366
00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:35.080
bit, what it is, Jim,
she looks at me and

367
00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:36.970
I don't remember all the
questions he asked. And he's

368
00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:38.500
like, you do this on
your free time. I'm like,

369
00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:40.900
yeah, this is important. He's
like, okay. And he looks

370
00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:42.490
everybody and goes, is this
are, you know, this is

371
00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:44.200
a good project. And he
has this lunch there. Cause

372
00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:46.630
we had this lunch meeting
and everyone goes, yeah, he's

373
00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:48.610
like, it looks at Steve.
And he goes, you found

374
00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:51.730
your project and walks out.
And so I'm like, cool,

375
00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:54.610
is that like we're signed
off. And so we walk

376
00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:56.500
out the door and the
admin, I remember that she

377
00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:58.510
looks and she goes, that
is the fastest meeting we've

378
00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:00.760
ever had. She goes and
she points at me. She

379
00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:04.420
goes, I like you. So
I'm at that point, we

380
00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:06.850
had approval. The things we
did after that was where

381
00:17:06.850 --> 00:17:08.710
do we put the project?
What license do we use?

382
00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:12.250
Jason Madison, who was a
big force in the open

383
00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:16.900
source and Microsoft agreements. I
guy was great too. We

384
00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:18.850
sat down with a number
of legal people and said,

385
00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:20.950
what license screen you use?
And remember, this is before

386
00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:23.380
any of the Microsoft open
source licenses exist or anything

387
00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:26.530
like that. And he said,
Actually, if there's any licensed

388
00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:28.810
before this, like what was,
was this the first thing

389
00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:30.640
that we really pushed out
with any kind of open

390
00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:34.210
source license? Yes. This is
the first thing that came

391
00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:36.460
from Microsoft that, you know,
it was a Microsoft project

392
00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:39.490
that came out under an
official OSI license. So we

393
00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:42.220
talked about licenses. We ended
up settling on the CPL.

394
00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:45.040
The, the legal guys could
explain to you why the

395
00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:50.820
CPL was this, the common
public, the common public license

396
00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:54.150
is the third version. I've
kind of heard of it

397
00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:56.970
as the IBM had the
IPL, which was the IBM

398
00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:59.250
public license that they based
on, some of the stuff

399
00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:01.200
that they had read and
like the differences between the

400
00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:03.750
Apache and the GPL. And
then the IBM came out

401
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:05.580
with the common public license.
And later on, they went

402
00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:08.460
on to the EPL, which
is the eclipse is like

403
00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:11.070
branches of this, you know,
how languages program. And they

404
00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:13.260
just all come back from
some language in the beginning.

405
00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:14.730
I don't know if it's
fourth or whatever it is.

406
00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:16.620
You can see the same
thing in open source license.

407
00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:18.300
This one B gets this
one and this one, we

408
00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:20.400
got this one and so
on and so forth. So

409
00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:23.810
to use the CPL, because
we want to use somebody

410
00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:26.420
else's license that was already
approved, just get this project

411
00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:27.890
out there. And then it
was, well, where do you

412
00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:31.670
put this? And the answer
was, well, you know, in

413
00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:35.330
2000, we're going through 2004
towards the end 2004, or,

414
00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:38.090
you know, beginning 2004. And
they're like, well, you know,

415
00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:41.420
the big place people are
on is so we're like,

416
00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:47.570
cool, we're going to SourceForge.
So April 5th, 2004, we released the

417
00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:51.590
Wix tool set under the
CPL on source four. And

418
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:53.090
this is Wix V too.
Cause we could be one

419
00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:55.970
was all VB script, never
saw the light of day

420
00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.010
outside of Microsoft. So it's
all the C sharp stuff.

421
00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:01.550
And poof, there you go.
Open source from Microsoft on

422
00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:05.990
April 5th, 2004. Huh? Was it too
much fanfare or was it

423
00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:09.740
too kind of a silent
nothing. No, it was so

424
00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:12.230
there was a set of
interviews set up. Jason Marisol

425
00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:15.320
had people he's meeting with
the news was first released

426
00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:19.550
to Mary Jo Foley. And
so she wrote a thing

427
00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:21.980
and then, and I had
a blog by that point.

428
00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:24.920
And so I wrote the
blog post that says, this

429
00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:29.060
is what it is, why
it exists and yay. And

430
00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:32.000
then that blog post just
got flooded with comments and

431
00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:35.810
all kinds of different things.
People were riding around the

432
00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:39.290
world. I remember there were
two running themes. The first

433
00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:41.690
theme is, Oh, Hey, you
know what? Mr. Barry cold and

434
00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:43.640
hell now, which was one
of the things Oh, flying

435
00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:45.260
pigs is another one. But
the one that I thought

436
00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:46.910
was most funny, he's like,
you know, this is like

437
00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:50.000
four days after April fool's
day. We're running. If Microsoft

438
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.380
is just playing a joke
on us a little late.

439
00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:58.610
Well they people did, but
they're like, is this for

440
00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:01.340
real? Like, there's Microsoft really
just do open source. And

441
00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:04.190
the answer was yes. Yeah,
we did right there that

442
00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:08.480
day released it. And now
we had a whole lot

443
00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:10.430
of, you know, critics and
people saying that it wasn't

444
00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:13.490
real, that what we were
doing really, for example, one

445
00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:15.290
of the mistakes I made
that I didn't even know

446
00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:18.560
was a mistake was the
initial build was released when

447
00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:21.110
I released the code. You
needed like visual studio to

448
00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:25.820
build it. And people were
like immediately complaining, Oh, this

449
00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:27.290
is just a ploy that
they're going to be self

450
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:28.830
source. That's going to force
you to buy copies of

451
00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:30.770
official studio. And I was
like, wow, people are going

452
00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:32.420
to use the Wix tool
set because it's going to,

453
00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:36.140
you know, it's so popular
among developers. Like they're trying

454
00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:38.180
to set up geeks that
they're going to buy a

455
00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:39.440
copy of. I was like,
well, that, wasn't what my

456
00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:41.330
intention was. All right. So
then I rewrote the build

457
00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:45.080
system and make literally, and
may, can all tools that

458
00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:48.790
were freely available from Microsoft
example to quiet all of

459
00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:51.820
these different concerns. And finally,
I got to the point,

460
00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:54.040
I'm like, you know what,
the way that we're going

461
00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:56.230
to be accepted by the
open source community is by

462
00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:57.700
being around for a long
time. So I was like,

463
00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:01.390
we're going to be, I'll
be here. People can be

464
00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:03.430
critical that, you know, Microsoft
is going to do this

465
00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:05.380
and they're gonna dump it
or whatever. I'm like, no,

466
00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:07.720
I'm, this is the project
I've been doing this up

467
00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:10.240
to this point up for
five years. This is not,

468
00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:12.760
this is not the end
at a certain level. This

469
00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:14.440
is like the end of
the beginning. And we're getting

470
00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:18.100
into the good stuff now.
And so we've been around

471
00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:19.690
for five years and all
those things are gone now.

472
00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:22.420
Now we're just, yeah. This
open source project for Microsoft,

473
00:21:22.690 --> 00:21:25.320
there's a whole bunch of
them who cares. So at

474
00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:27.780
this point, you're, you're, you've
been out 10 years now.

475
00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:30.420
Well, this project has been
around for 10 years. So

476
00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:33.740
for me, the way stool
toolsets existed in 1999 at

477
00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:36.510
the end of 1999. So
I pass the 10 year

478
00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:38.790
Mark, you know, end of
last year and it's been

479
00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:42.450
public for over five years.
Wow. And does this actually

480
00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:44.580
ship in visual studio? Like,
can I get this in

481
00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:47.040
visual studio 2008 or 2010?
Or do I still have

482
00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:49.890
to download it separately? You
still download it separately. There

483
00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:52.410
was a deal we cooked
up for a little while

484
00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:55.170
to have the Wix tool
set ship as part of

485
00:21:55.380 --> 00:22:00.270
the visual studio, 2010 and
the business guys got into

486
00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:02.010
it. They're like, yeah. You
know, we're not sure why

487
00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:04.830
don't you guys just keep
doing this? So the decision

488
00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:06.060
was then to go, you
know, we're not sure we

489
00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:07.740
want to do all the
work to bring it into

490
00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:09.750
the visual studio box with
all of that means. So

491
00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:11.040
why don't you guys stay
down low? So we're on

492
00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:12.750
S gallery now. So, you
know, you can get to

493
00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:15.570
it through the visual studio
gallery download and you can

494
00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:17.670
pull it from SourceForge. You
can pick a weekly build,

495
00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:20.880
but we are not in
the visual studio. Do you

496
00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:22.860
think that that gives you
less legitimacy? I mean, in

497
00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:24.600
the sense that, I mean,
it's still awesome and the

498
00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:27.570
accomplishment is great, but did
they not put it into

499
00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:29.790
the product just out of
laziness or did they think

500
00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:32.640
that by putting it in
the product, it might change

501
00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:37.350
the way people felt about
it? For me, I had,

502
00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:39.870
I think I had it
in my mind, how I

503
00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:42.420
could explain the differences between
what the community version would

504
00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:44.790
have been. And the visual
studio version would have been,

505
00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:48.090
cause they would have been
different versions slightly, right? Cause

506
00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:49.830
the community one would have
continued and the visual studio

507
00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:52.770
one would have stopped, stabilized,
shipping the product and then

508
00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:54.810
stayed there for a long
time. And we had, we

509
00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:56.490
were working on things to
try to get it so

510
00:22:56.490 --> 00:22:58.620
you could pull the community
version out and swap the

511
00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:00.690
fitness studio one out if
you wanted to move forward

512
00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:02.340
with the community thing. So
we're getting all of this

513
00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:04.980
and it was just kinda
like, you know where we're

514
00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:07.440
at, this isn't exactly the
experience we want to have

515
00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:08.880
the visuals that you guys
decide. This is exactly the

516
00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:11.220
experience we wanted to have.
So did it affect our

517
00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:17.280
legitimacy? The, the problem with
open source projects that are

518
00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:20.340
run like by the set
of volunteers, like they are

519
00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:21.840
in the way that we
run the Wix tool set

520
00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:25.470
is that there isn't a
company entity behind it that

521
00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:27.930
says, if you want to
pay me money, I will

522
00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:31.830
support you for, you know,
using this product. So that

523
00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:34.260
is one of the things
that I know affects the

524
00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:37.710
legitimacy of the Wix tool
set. Like it affects the

525
00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:40.620
legitimacy of any open source
project, which is the, you

526
00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:43.560
know, if a company, big
companies typically want to call

527
00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:45.290
somebody up and say, I
need you to fix this.

528
00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:46.640
I want you to fix
this now. Cause I am

529
00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:48.530
paying you this much money.
We don't have anybody that

530
00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:50.450
does that for the waste
tool set today. That's the

531
00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:53.960
only legitimacy. After that five
years in the community we've

532
00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:57.500
released, we released the Wix
two version. We've released the

533
00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:01.820
Wix three version that released
last summer. And we're working

534
00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:03.950
on with three, five to
bring in this chain or

535
00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:07.760
bootstrapper, we're alive, we're kicking,
we're growing. We get more

536
00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:10.910
people all the time. We
have people saying both good

537
00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:13.160
and bad things about us.
You know, about our language,

538
00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:15.260
about the way the tool
works. It's a good stuff.

539
00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:17.150
I appreciate the bad stuff.
I take it as, Oh,

540
00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:18.770
that's what we need to
fix. Got it. Thank you

541
00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:22.250
for the feedback. And we
have nothing, but I don't

542
00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:24.530
know, another 10 years ahead
of us, of things to

543
00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:29.900
improve. So we're a legitimate
opensource project with the way

544
00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:32.750
all those things work. We
are legit. I mean, we

545
00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:35.540
have some really big customers,
you know, office, visual studio,

546
00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:38.090
almost all Microsoft uses which
tool set at that point.

547
00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:40.370
That helps a lot with
people going, does this thing

548
00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:43.690
really work, But that was
the Wix tool set. Now

549
00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:46.000
that this isn't, this isn't
your job though, right? I

550
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.890
mean, has this, how does
this affect your job at

551
00:24:47.890 --> 00:24:52.600
Microsoft? Are you still doing
this on Thursday nights with

552
00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:55.180
your friends at the house?
Or do you have time

553
00:24:55.210 --> 00:24:57.460
at work on working like
nine to five that you

554
00:24:57.460 --> 00:25:00.310
can actually work on this?
So no, the way I

555
00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:02.140
still run it, as you
know, it's the thing I

556
00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:06.700
do on Saturdays or Thursday
nights or I interleave questions

557
00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:08.830
in the middle of the
day. Quite often when people

558
00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:11.530
ask questions, sometimes I'll answer
them and things like that

559
00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:13.840
when they're sent to me.
And then I just kind

560
00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:16.450
of mentally know that, Hey,
I have to work harder

561
00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:18.940
in the evening or something
to catch up any time

562
00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:21.010
that I might spend on
this. So it's still the

563
00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:25.780
side thing for me. And
that's starting to shift around

564
00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:28.690
a little bit, but that
to me, it's, it's still

565
00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:32.110
a side project has been.
And I just, I don't

566
00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:34.930
know, work harder at my
day job, I guess, Nippy

567
00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:38.500
better if Microsoft or your
bosses, I gave you like

568
00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:40.600
Fridays or Thursdays and Fridays
to work on this. I

569
00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:42.940
mean, at some point you'll
get married and have kids

570
00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:46.330
or get bored or I
don't know, get an Xbox

571
00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:51.430
and suddenly your weekend time
will dry up. So the,

572
00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:54.370
the that's true. And I
have, I did get married

573
00:25:54.460 --> 00:26:02.080
through this process and no,
I did get married throughout

574
00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:03.970
all of this process. I
did get married. I started

575
00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:06.040
dating when we started going
open source. I got married

576
00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:08.290
sometime after it was released
as open source. So she

577
00:26:08.290 --> 00:26:10.240
kind of came into it,
knowing that this is a

578
00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:13.300
thing that I do, which
probably helps, but it's not

579
00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:15.280
just me. You know, people
talk a lot about the

580
00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:17.260
way they'll say, Oh, that's
Rob mentioned, rule is code.

581
00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:19.990
I'm like, that's not even
close to fair. I'm actually

582
00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:22.840
on my, I think fourth
generation of set of people

583
00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:25.390
that were coming toolset. I've
been consistent through it. But

584
00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:28.840
you know, we've had names
like, you know, Derek Cicerone

585
00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:31.510
who now works for a
company in the Valley, Scott

586
00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:34.720
Kurtzberg, who still works in
office Reed, Gustin. He now

587
00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:37.150
works at Google, but I
mean, those guys all were

588
00:26:37.150 --> 00:26:39.430
like the first unit, the
second unit had, you know,

589
00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:44.280
people like Justin Rockwood and
Bob Aaronson, Justin still works

590
00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:48.540
in office. Bob works. Now
I am not alone. Like,

591
00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:51.390
I mean, we're talking this
project has, I haven't counted

592
00:26:51.390 --> 00:26:54.150
in a while, but there
are at least, you know,

593
00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:56.490
I think 50,000 lines of
code in the and linker.

594
00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:01.010
Wow. So it's non trivially,
large. And certainly not something

595
00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:03.680
one person can do in
their spare time. No, not,

596
00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:06.140
I mean it could someone
write that many lines of

597
00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:08.600
code in 10 years? Yes.
I'm in the free time.

598
00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:11.870
That's that's trickier. So the
fact that I'm not alone,

599
00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:15.440
you know, it's like, no,
it's this and the people

600
00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:17.210
are probably still set really
like it. Like we like

601
00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:19.850
the communities we like working
together. We keep moving it

602
00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:23.120
forward and we get a
lot of nice feedback. Regular

603
00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:27.650
feedback is hugely popular. So
all of this together is

604
00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.670
makes the project role really?
I don't know. We've been

605
00:27:31.670 --> 00:27:34.370
running really well. It hasn't
been a problem. The other

606
00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:35.930
thing is that I tend
to work in deployment related

607
00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:37.640
stuff in all of the
jobs that I've had at

608
00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:40.460
Microsoft. So I'm applying that
knowledge to the waste tool

609
00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:41.990
set. So it's not like
I'm out of the domain,

610
00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:44.300
not thinking about deployment. I'm
not just working on the

611
00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:47.580
core tool set day in
and day out. And, and,

612
00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:49.370
and the bosses are supportive.
They're not, I mean like

613
00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:51.110
when you have your reviews
are like, yeah, good job

614
00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:54.110
on the Wix thing, keep
it up. So let me

615
00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:55.580
give you a real good
example of what ends up

616
00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:57.080
happening. So this is one
of the things, one of

617
00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:58.850
the things we grow, people's
like, you know, and which

618
00:27:58.850 --> 00:28:00.200
tool set. I spent a
lot of time growing. The

619
00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:02.690
people work on it probably
recently like coming around. And

620
00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:03.650
one of the things you
do is you want to

621
00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:06.410
kind of, we call it
increasing your sphere of influence

622
00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:08.000
people. You know, things that
you can do so that

623
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.260
you can do a better
job at your job by

624
00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:12.290
knowing and being connected and
just, Hey, Oh, Hey, I

625
00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:13.580
know this other guy. He
told me to stay in.

626
00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:14.990
That's going to make my
day job better because I

627
00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:16.790
know that that's the kind
of thing customers will want

628
00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:21.800
in. I previously worked at
windows marketplace, which was selling

629
00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:25.100
software online. And at the
time we were starting to

630
00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:28.670
bring on Microsoft products into
that thing. They've been kind

631
00:28:28.670 --> 00:28:30.830
of there, but we're trying
to get them into better.

632
00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:32.210
And I was like, you
know, I happen to know

633
00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:34.250
pretty much all the teams
at Microsoft. So which team,

634
00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:36.050
you know, I could go
to our program managers say,

635
00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:38.030
which team would you like
to go talk to inside

636
00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:42.080
Microsoft about delivering their stuff
into windows marketplace and the

637
00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:43.670
program managers look at me
and go, you can get

638
00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:45.620
me any team. I'm like,
well, yeah, I'll just call

639
00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:47.660
it a setup guy. Who's
going to be right next

640
00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:50.150
to the release and the
release manager for that product.

641
00:28:50.450 --> 00:28:51.620
And they'll be able to
tell you everything you want

642
00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:53.750
to know about that. And
the program managers like that's

643
00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:56.360
awesome. So that kind of
stuff ends up helping me

644
00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:59.390
do my day job better.
Even though I spend my

645
00:28:59.390 --> 00:29:03.020
free time doing these other
things. Does that of make

646
00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:05.090
sense? Yeah. I just want
to, I want to understand

647
00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:10.820
whether someone is, whether people
at Microsoft are expected to

648
00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:13.010
do like a bunch of
opensource work on the side

649
00:29:13.010 --> 00:29:16.190
and the regular job and
be awesome at everything. And

650
00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:18.140
if bosses say things like
really, you ought to be

651
00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:22.130
working on your open source
thing less, you know, if

652
00:29:22.130 --> 00:29:25.220
they, if they realize that
there's not only just life

653
00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:26.900
out of work in a
personal sense, but also in

654
00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:29.390
a work sense. Well, you
know, if, if I was,

655
00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:31.190
you know, if I was
sucking at my job, I'm

656
00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:33.260
sure they'd say, dude, you
know, you probably need to

657
00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:35.120
work a little bit harder
at your job. So I

658
00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:37.310
guess I've always known that
I have to do good

659
00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:41.790
work no matter what. Well,
this is really interesting. I

660
00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:43.960
think It's great that this
has lasted this long, that

661
00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:46.840
the product is, is 10
years old. And I get

662
00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:49.630
to give you big credit
for sticking with it this

663
00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:53.190
long. Yeah. And so, and
I have a surprise coming

664
00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:55.740
out in another month that
I'm going to talk about

665
00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:00.390
around my birthday time when
I, that I'm not quite

666
00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:02.850
ready to tell you, you're
about a month early. So

667
00:30:02.850 --> 00:30:04.200
you're going to tell me
that you have a surprise,

668
00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:07.140
but you're not going to
use the show here as,

669
00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:09.690
as your, as your, your
voice box to spread the

670
00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:11.280
word. You can't give us
a hint. Can you give

671
00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:15.930
us something we can guess
about A little bit of

672
00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:19.620
a guess, a little bit
of a hint it's it's,

673
00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:23.010
it's all related to the
Wix tool set and Well,

674
00:30:23.010 --> 00:30:25.950
gosh, I wonder how I
could have guessed that It'll

675
00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:29.730
be good. So give it
and, and give another month.

676
00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:32.100
And I will, I'll have
I'm I've been formulating this

677
00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:33.480
blog post in my head.
It's kind of been this

678
00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:35.370
thing. That's been long coming
for me a long time

679
00:30:35.370 --> 00:30:37.740
to make the, the set
of changes that have all

680
00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:42.150
come together. So, and another
month you'll see it. Okay.

681
00:30:42.150 --> 00:30:44.790
