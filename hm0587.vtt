Hi, this is Scott Hanselman.

8
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.090
This is another episode of
Hanselminutes today. I'm talking with

9
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.810
muddy Yusuf. He is the
CTO at gyroscope innovations. How

10
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.660
are you, sir? Good, sir.
How are you doing pretty

11
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.720
good. I, I don't remember
how I bumped into gyroscope.

12
00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.160
We were talking about something
on Twitter and I was

13
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.800
talking about how I have
like my Fitbit and I

14
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.260
have my Microsoft band, but
I also have my blood

15
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.560
sugar. I got all this
data about myself and I

16
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.500
think it was Lynn who
jumped in and was like,

17
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.100
Oh, check out gyroscope. And
you know, people are always

18
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.160
jumping in and saying, check
out really Lynn Johnson. She

19
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.840
says, yeah, I got gyroscope.
And I was like, Oh,

20
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.860
okay. You know, whatever. I
was absolutely blown away. Like

21
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.950
I apologize for making the
first part of this podcast,

22
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.520
me gushing over gyroscope, but
I lose like legit. Wow.

23
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.450
Because I plugged in all
this stuff for my life.

24
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.570
So let me back up.
I've just gushed. What is

25
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.680
gyroscope? Gyroscope is what we're
positioning to be is the

26
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.410
operating system for your body.
So you're generating all this

27
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.710
data around your heart rate,
your activity level, what you're

28
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.840
doing on your computer and
all these are, like you

29
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.060
said, at the beginning of
our siloed into different pieces

30
00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.240
of your life. And what
Doris code provides is funding

31
00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.600
all into one space where
you can look and analyze

32
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.120
and view what you've been
doing. You can see when

33
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.500
you had a good day,
see what you had a

34
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.520
bad day. We connect to
pretty much everything. Our app

35
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.980
for the most part was
an iOS app. We recently

36
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.190
went into beta for Android
app and we sync with

37
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.700
Strava, Fitbit. We do a
bunch of stuff from blood

38
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.770
sugar most recently, cause we
noticed a lot of people

39
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.320
have been talking about that.
And you know, our users,

40
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.150
the ones that we've had
for a long time are

41
00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.850
very passionate. And I'm assuming
that's where Lynn came in

42
00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.880
and kind of suggest to
you. And yes, for the

43
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.490
most part, it's just something
that people use to track

44
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.500
their entire lives, as opposed
to just, Hey, I'm a

45
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.030
runner and I'm going to
look at this sort of

46
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.660
thing and not care about
the rest of my life,

47
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.670
but it gives you a
full context. And that's really

48
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.070
what the idea is. And
we're aiming to be like

49
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.990
the activity monitor for your
body. Yeah. And it felt

50
00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.150
though there was, there was
some things that made it

51
00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.270
stand apart. Like someone who's
listening might say, Oh, well,

52
00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.920
okay, it's a health tracker.
Well, it's more of like

53
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.390
a life tracker where you
get to decide what parts

54
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.790
of your life matter to
you. Like I've always felt

55
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.290
like you just said, I
go into an app and

56
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.360
it's like, Oh, this is
for runners. I'm not a

57
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.150
runner. Oh this is for
bicycle people. I'm not that

58
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.530
person. I went in here
and I, I plugged into

59
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.070
existing apps that I already
had, like my fitness pal

60
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:26.320
or Fitbit or the, the,
the, the builtin health stuff.

61
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.980
That's plugged into the, the
iPhone for me as an

62
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.910
iPhone developer, the idea that
it's using the stuff I

63
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.210
already am putting into the
system. Like for example, I

64
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.360
have a third party open
source app that manages my

65
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.110
blood sugar, that your app
gyroscope doesn't know anything about

66
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.590
it's called loop, but my
app puts stuff in a

67
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.490
centralized health store. And you
just noticed that and picked

68
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.610
it up and did the
right thing. That's amazing. Absolutely.

69
00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.220
And we kind of do
know that it's loop. We

70
00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.370
also collect sources for these
sorts of things. And so

71
00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.470
we kind of know where
the data's coming from because

72
00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.060
some of the apps after
a while, cause a lot

73
00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.610
of the issues that we're
facing on the building gyroscope

74
00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.970
end of it is like
data consistency where where's the

75
00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.330
data coming from, are these
good, reliable sources. So there's

76
00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.040
a lot of work put
towards the duping and making

77
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.860
sure things are accurate. And
so keeping track of sources

78
00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.620
is good to know. And
I'm sure when whatever the

79
00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.590
app that you said, the
loop was using health kits.

80
00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.000
And then when it stores
it in health care, it

81
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.090
gives some information about where
it came from. So we

82
00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.490
pull everything from health, get
everything from your blood sugar,

83
00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.530
all the way down to
like your heart rate minute

84
00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.170
to minute. So it gives
us a lot of information

85
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:38.340
around people's health and what
they're using to actually track

86
00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.080
this stuff. So if we
notice a lot of people

87
00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.420
are using Garmin, we can
kind of go, okay, here's

88
00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.280
a priority and something we
want to take a look

89
00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.090
at and kind of gear
that towards building stuff for

90
00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.650
those tools. So I'm looking
here in my app right

91
00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.570
now. I've got it on
my iPhone and I've got

92
00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.390
Fitbit. And then I've got
my, my Withings scale. So

93
00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.130
I am tracking them. I'm
trying to get loosened. Wait,

94
00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.940
I got that plugged in.
I got four square. And

95
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.130
it also like how I
move and where I go.

96
00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.110
I still use Foursquare. I
know a lot of people

97
00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.140
don't, but there's this great
app called moves that basically

98
00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.720
just watches you travel and
keeps a log. It's kind

99
00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.640
of a private log. It's
not meant for you to

100
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:16.710
like, for people to spy
on you. It's just for

101
00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.540
you to know where you
went and what you did

102
00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.730
and how long you spent
there. All of that gets

103
00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:24.810
plugged into, into this. And
then there's like a dashboard

104
00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.110
for all these different aspects
of your life. Absolutely. And

105
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.660
once you start seeing this
stuff visualized, you're like, I

106
00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.670
had a real shocking moment
that I go to like

107
00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:35.430
maybe, you know, in a
month, maybe 10 different unique

108
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.460
places, right? Like two of
which are new and everywhere

109
00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.340
else is just like either
the gym, home, movie theater,

110
00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:44.460
favorite place to eat. You'll
notice that you don't leave

111
00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.620
a certain area after awhile.
And the good thing about

112
00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.770
movies is constantly on and
it realizes where you're at

113
00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.830
places when you've been before.
So it learns over time.

114
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.650
And then that, that learning
ability gets passed onto gyroscope.

115
00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.380
And we can kind of
cluster things and kind of

116
00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.950
show where you're spending time.
Some people even have a

117
00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.260
thing that's automatic. Have you
heard about that company that

118
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.270
has like a little thing
that you plug into your

119
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.680
car? Yeah. Yeah. Would he
be tube connector for older

120
00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.600
cars and it tells you
how your car is doing

121
00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.360
and where it went. Yeah.
So w through rescue time,

122
00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.970
some people sink that in,
right? So you can calculate

123
00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:19.480
how much time you're in
the car, like commuting. So,

124
00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:21.160
you know, some people realize,
Oh crap, I'm in the

125
00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.710
car 40 hours a month,
which is something that, you

126
00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:26.920
know, people don't realize minute
to minute when you're stuck

127
00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.620
in traffic, but over a
period of time, it can

128
00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.590
stack up and some people
would stop, stop being in

129
00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:35.440
the car, they'll ride a
bike or run or something

130
00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.290
like that. Instead of, you
know, when it's convenient instead

131
00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:40.390
of being in the car
and that'll have effects over

132
00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:43.000
over the time, right? Like
if you're instead of driving

133
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.010
40 hours and sitting on
your butt and do nothing,

134
00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.890
you're getting a bike start
doing stuff. It'll, it'll show

135
00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:51.340
in your waistline. Say the
list. The thing that I

136
00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:53.620
think is the most powerful
about what you just said

137
00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:56.110
was that even like you,
as a CTO and working

138
00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:00.910
on this product yourself, you're
being surprised by, by your

139
00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:03.730
own product. It's, it's giving
you insights into stuff about

140
00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:05.410
yourself that you didn't even
know. And I think that

141
00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:07.960
seems to be like the
root about why one would

142
00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.110
measure, why would you let
a system carry, you know,

143
00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:13.210
look at all this data
so you can be surprised

144
00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:16.030
and then make a change.
Well, absolutely like, right? So,

145
00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:19.240
so I've started working a
lot longer than I was

146
00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.280
previously. I'd be at my
desk, kind of doing things,

147
00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.040
dealing with issues and stuff.
And you start not, you

148
00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:27.040
miss a gym session here
and there because your mind

149
00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.650
only realizes, you know, I
haven't gone to the gym

150
00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:32.080
past couple of weeks. Right.
But you know, in your

151
00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.420
mind, like, that'll happen. The
trend will change, right? You'll

152
00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:38.200
stop completely going. And you
start feeling groggy or start

153
00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:41.560
your sleep quality kind of
drops. And you only notice

154
00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:43.780
that when you look at
the data in aggregate and

155
00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:46.270
are kind of looking across
the scope, like, what did

156
00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:49.720
I change? Like I started
working more, I started sleeping

157
00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.510
less and that, you know,
with those habits come eating

158
00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:56.290
more and then gaining weight.
So watching that in aggregate

159
00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:59.170
is really important because you
won't know day to day,

160
00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:02.620
like there's this book that
I read it's about this

161
00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:06.310
guy who went to the
memory championships. He was a

162
00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:09.220
journalist and he was writing
about it. And then he

163
00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:11.260
came back and won. But
this was one point where

164
00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.150
he's with his mentor and
he's kind of talking about

165
00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:15.970
it. And he's like, your
experience around things is, you

166
00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:18.400
know what you remember? And
if you keep forgetting things,

167
00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.500
as you go along, there's
no way to correct in

168
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.740
order to manage what you're
doing correctly incorrectly, you have

169
00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:26.290
to remember, and gyroscope allows
you to do that over

170
00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:28.090
the period of time. You
can start to see when

171
00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:30.400
you dipped off and we're
working on a few things

172
00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:33.550
there where it notices your
behavior has changed. So we

173
00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:35.740
can tell you, Hey, you
started working more. You know,

174
00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:38.470
you went from being this
person in six months to

175
00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:41.170
being this person in six
months. And you can, it'll

176
00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:46.090
click you in earlier than
later. People don't realize Is

177
00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:50.230
that as software people, fundamentally,
we know that you have

178
00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:52.930
to test stuff. Otherwise you
can't make a change and

179
00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:55.800
you have to measure things.
Otherwise you can't cut. You

180
00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.860
know, this is a fundamental
thing about engineering, about software,

181
00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:03.960
about woodworking, right. Measure twice.
Cut, cut. Once this feels

182
00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.060
like this is a measure
tool that is going to

183
00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:09.210
allow us to make changes
in all aspects of our

184
00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:13.640
life. Yeah. And, and, and
it, and it's with context,

185
00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:15.170
right? You can look at
like, when you go to

186
00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:19.580
the doc yet with context,
when you give, when you

187
00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:21.500
go to the doctor, for
example, they kind of measure

188
00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:23.570
a few things where they
think the proper problem is,

189
00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:26.180
and they kind of hope
they can find it. If

190
00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:28.220
they see something there, they'll
wait a couple months, do

191
00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:31.550
some more tests and kind
of see, but they're there.

192
00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:34.190
They're looking to get a
trend from a few samples

193
00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:36.890
over time, right. When something's
really out of whack, those

194
00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:39.290
things, time to show up.
But if you're, if you

195
00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:41.420
don't have a baseline natural,
you don't have a baseline

196
00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:43.490
for yourself. Like up until
a few months ago, I

197
00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:46.460
didn't know where my baseline
blood sugar was right now.

198
00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:47.810
I have a feel for
it. So when it's a

199
00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:50.660
bit high, I'm like, that's
not normal for me. And

200
00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:52.490
I can, I can either
take action and go, Hey,

201
00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:54.020
I should go check this
out. Or I'm like, Oh,

202
00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:55.790
that's within normal. I had
a bunch of Coke earlier

203
00:09:55.790 --> 00:10:00.410
today. Right. And with that
context, it provides you some

204
00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:02.420
understanding of what's going on.
If you worked out a

205
00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:04.430
lot the day before the
next day, your heart rate

206
00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:07.250
may be a little bit
lower, or there's various things

207
00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:09.410
that we're looking at that
we're starting to see correlations

208
00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:12.710
between. And it's important to
kind of surface those, just

209
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:14.660
so, you know, as yourself,
what is going on with

210
00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:17.510
your body, and you may
not prescribe to the, you

211
00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:19.460
know, to the norm, like
they suggest, you know, normal

212
00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:21.770
heart rates between here and
here, certain blood pressures between

213
00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:23.570
here and here, but you
may be a little bit

214
00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:25.970
different, right. And then when
you go to the doctor,

215
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.280
they're, you know, they're just,
you know, there's a problem

216
00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:30.320
they're trying to fix it,
but like a mechanic, they're

217
00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:33.440
not really trying to understand
your whole system and fine

218
00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.020
tune it like you do
a machine or a server

219
00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:39.620
or something like that. So
when you're there kind of

220
00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:40.940
just trying to deal with
the problem and plug the

221
00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:42.500
leak and kind of keep
moving, kind of give you

222
00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:45.170
suggestions to improve it going
forward, but you have no

223
00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:47.120
data to base that off
of. You're not making a

224
00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:51.410
decision, like a conscientious decision,
as I would look at

225
00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:54.680
it in engineering, we're hoping
to change that sort of

226
00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:57.710
thing. So we've been starting
pulling in more medical, useful

227
00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:01.370
information and kind of helping
our users expose that from

228
00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:02.960
where it's already stored in
your phone. And you're not

229
00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:05.770
really seeing it in a
way that's really impactful. Yeah.

230
00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:07.730
Yeah. One of the things
that I was impressed about

231
00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:10.790
and I'm interested in from
a software architecture perspective is

232
00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:15.650
that rather than trying to
be a, a piece of

233
00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:19.940
software that, that, that gets
this data itself, it's really

234
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:22.970
interacting in a very creative
way with lots of other

235
00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:26.600
pieces of existing software. Like
this is an integration hub.

236
00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:30.230
You plug into moves, you
plug into rescue time, which

237
00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:32.540
people use to track their
computer time. You plug into

238
00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:35.560
Runkeeper. And all of these
kinds of things has that

239
00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:38.540
seems like a new, a
new perspective on how to

240
00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:42.200
design software. You're really a
tool that gets along well

241
00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:45.140
with other pieces of software,
as opposed to trying to

242
00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:48.920
do all that work yourself.
Absolutely. So the team's fairly

243
00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:51.230
small. So that was one
of the ways we kinda

244
00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:53.590
helped us get out the
door and kind of pulling

245
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:56.740
that information. Now we're starting
to be a generator of

246
00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:58.450
this information. So we have
a few ways of people

247
00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:00.700
entering things where they're not
that many tools or the

248
00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:03.760
tools are very expensive. So
things like ketones and blood,

249
00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:06.010
blood sugar, and stuff like
that, you can manually enter

250
00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:08.380
into the app, but we
do leverage all the tools

251
00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:10.180
that people have. So if
people have bought a Fitbit

252
00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:12.730
already, or if people already
have an Apple watch or

253
00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:16.210
a Samsung's offering, we try
to pull in that data

254
00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.670
and try to leverage it
for the user, right? Like

255
00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:20.350
if you're already generating this
stuff, we want to go

256
00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:22.090
get it from where it
is. We don't want you

257
00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:24.370
to starting from day one
where you got nothing and

258
00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:26.770
you can't, you gotta start
setting it up or spend

259
00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:28.720
a bunch of money to
get on. Right. We're trying

260
00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:31.120
to use the stuff that
already exists and provide that

261
00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:32.980
insight to you. Cause you're
already out putting that stuff

262
00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:35.260
and you're, and you're giving
it to another company to

263
00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.420
kind of, you know, use
for yourself. But they're also

264
00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:39.400
using it too. So we
kind of go, okay, you

265
00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:42.460
can take this information, benefit
from it through the context.

266
00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:44.980
Like when you, when you
go for a walk, one

267
00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:46.930
app, maybe just be a
pedometer. And it's not really

268
00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:49.270
tracking where you are and
moves knows where you are,

269
00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:51.610
but it's not really a
predominant. It kind of is,

270
00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:54.010
but not a very good
one. So when you combine

271
00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:56.680
those two things, it becomes
more useful. Hey, I walked

272
00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:58.420
a bunch cause I was
walking to the store and

273
00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:00.520
I'm like, those, you can
see those Carlos, all those

274
00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:03.970
contexts can multiply to provide
all types of insights around

275
00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:06.880
what you're doing. And generally
we want to integrate with

276
00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:08.920
most things to pull information
in and then we store

277
00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:10.780
it because a lot of
these services come and go.

278
00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:14.770
And sometimes up until recently,
iOS didn't really offer a

279
00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:18.520
way to sync your data
between devices. We store the

280
00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:20.590
data and you can move
between your phones and still

281
00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:23.830
have it on there. They
originally implemented that thing, but

282
00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:26.380
it's also a way to
store your data to longterm.

283
00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:30.840
One of the, the, a
great example of presenting data

284
00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:34.230
contextually in a smart way
is your, your beta feature

285
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:38.400
called mindmap. And I think
it's so clever because you,

286
00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:41.790
you can't get in my
brain, you can't decide what

287
00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:44.100
I'm doing, but you know,
if I'm working, if I'm

288
00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:46.500
at my computer, you can
use rescue time to tell

289
00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:48.840
me that rescue time is
an app that will tell

290
00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:51.150
you what app is in
the front, in the foreground.

291
00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:53.970
So if you're running, you
know, a terminal, you're probably

292
00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:56.070
being productive. And if you're
on Reddit, you're probably not

293
00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:58.950
productive. Right. And then you
can tell whether I'm playing

294
00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:01.620
music or not. So then
all of those things can

295
00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:06.030
theoretically give you a context
about what's going on in

296
00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:08.070
my mind, right? And if
I have a Fitbit or

297
00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:11.220
an Apple watch, you can
tell if I'm asleep, that's,

298
00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:14.850
that's an amazing roll up
of data that I didn't

299
00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:18.660
even imagine was possible. Well,
yeah. So that's one of

300
00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:20.730
our main views and that's
one of the really cool

301
00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:22.890
things. When you first start
using it, you can see

302
00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:25.650
when you slept. And then
the second you started working

303
00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:27.930
in the second year at
the gym, working out in

304
00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:30.990
one whole view, right? And
at a glance, you can

305
00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:33.090
tell if you had a,
you know, people have an

306
00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:34.950
ideal of a day, you
know, they wake up, they're

307
00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:37.470
productive at work. They go
and, you know, eat well

308
00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:40.230
throughout the day. Maybe have
a workout and then come

309
00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:42.210
back home, relax, and then
go to sleep. And my

310
00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:45.570
mind, that's a well balanced
day. And that's, you can

311
00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:47.700
look at that just at
a glance from taking a

312
00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:49.950
look at these things. And
the cross section of all

313
00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:52.370
these data points, like our
sleep AI is based off

314
00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:54.950
the cross section of these
things, right? Some people may

315
00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:57.380
not have a tool that
generates sleep or record your

316
00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:59.570
sleep. There are many apps
that are there, but your

317
00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:03.620
activity is the true sense
of like the truth. Like

318
00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:05.480
when did I actually lay
down one that I stopped

319
00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:07.040
when I did, when did
I get off the computer?

320
00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:08.960
When did I go into
bed? And our sleep, AI

321
00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:11.780
meshes a few of these
stuff plus plus a few

322
00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:15.140
other things internally to figure
out when you're asleep and

323
00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:18.440
it's fairly accurate. We recently
released that. And it, it

324
00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:22.690
can pinpoint when you went
to bed. Hmm. How, how

325
00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:24.730
does it, like, how do
you know that? Like, you

326
00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:26.290
know, I'm not at my
computer, you know, I'm at

327
00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:29.890
Ben bed, why everything stopped
me? Well, if you, if

328
00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:31.690
you have a band on,
so the requirement for that

329
00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:35.320
thing is having rescue time
and abandoned with those two

330
00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:39.820
things combined. If you're not,
you know, moving and moving

331
00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:42.220
around, you're probably laying down.
We have some accelerometer data

332
00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:44.350
that we're trying to pull
in recently to make sure

333
00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:47.590
that people are, are laying
flat, that combined with a

334
00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:50.530
bit of activity tracking from
when you've recently. So you

335
00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:52.540
can correct the sleep AI.
And we'll start to figure

336
00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:55.450
out when you naturally go
to sleep. And at which

337
00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:57.210
point, And is this, which,
which health band does, is

338
00:15:57.220 --> 00:16:02.260
any health band anyhow. And
it generates a reliable step

339
00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:05.230
count. And if you have
RescueTime connected, those two combined

340
00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:08.890
will give a pretty strong
correlation of when you went

341
00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:10.930
to sleep. Granted like things
like laying down during the

342
00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:12.610
day or taking your watch
off, do break it. So

343
00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:16.930
we do D D D
bounce, those bad values. But

344
00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:18.640
for the most part, if
you have those two things

345
00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:21.550
on for the most part,
it'll work fairly well. That's

346
00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:24.700
amazing. One of the things
that's also very striking about

347
00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:27.340
your stuff is that there's
all the tech behind it,

348
00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:31.210
which is amazing, but it's,
it's the, the design of

349
00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:34.150
it. The visual design, I
guess I apologize. I'm gushing,

350
00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:38.920
but it's so darn pretty.
Does this is this you,

351
00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:41.560
did you have a particular
person who designed this look

352
00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:43.240
and feel, did you just
get lucky with a great

353
00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:47.840
designer because it's extremely striking
in its, in its and

354
00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:51.490
its visual design. So the
CEO of nones is responsible

355
00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:53.350
for a lot of that.
And I know from the

356
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:55.210
day one, we kind of
made the focus of like,

357
00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:57.580
this needs to be consumable
in the sense that you're

358
00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:00.490
not looking at boring graphs.
You're not looking at things

359
00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:03.430
that are aren't as engaging.
So when something is striking

360
00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:05.020
to you, you'll give it
another look. You'll kind of

361
00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:07.840
look deeper, kind of look
to see correlations between things.

362
00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:10.750
And we think that's tremendously
important, especially when you're dealing

363
00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:13.300
with data that can be
kind of, you know, not

364
00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:15.460
so engaging when you're looking
at, you know, a simple

365
00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:18.400
step graph, can't be too
striking. We always try to

366
00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:21.610
have two levels of, of
information when it comes to

367
00:17:21.610 --> 00:17:23.440
us. So we can see
minute to minute how often

368
00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:25.480
you were walking, but you
can also then see clusters

369
00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:28.090
around that. You can also
see it when it's, when,

370
00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:30.430
when you were doing something
else, how that affected your

371
00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:33.160
step graph or when it's
affected your heart rate. One

372
00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:35.110
another really cool one is
when you're working out and

373
00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:38.920
you start a workout, you'll,
you'll immediately see your heart

374
00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:42.010
rate spike up. Right. And
that means you're, you're, you

375
00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:43.870
know, you're doing something different
than you are when you're

376
00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:46.810
sitting down or watching a
television show and you'll see,

377
00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:48.250
Oh, why did that happen?
And then you'll look at

378
00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:50.310
another graph and you're Oh,
because I was running or

379
00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:53.250
I was playing some kind
of sport. So to provide

380
00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:56.020
that context, that requires a
bit of good design and,

381
00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:58.560
and making it a priority,
right. We can just lay

382
00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:00.360
all the data out and
kinda like, let you draw

383
00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:03.750
the conclusions, but we hope
to provide a clean and

384
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:06.060
beautiful interface in which you
can enjoy it and share

385
00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:08.370
like, one of the huge
parts of gyroscope is the

386
00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:11.460
cards that we generate, which
are little, small infographics for

387
00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:15.240
your day. Right. And people
kind of share those online.

388
00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:17.550
And then that's what kind
of lets us grow and

389
00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:19.680
kind of gain more users
and stuff. Cause they're like,

390
00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:21.900
Oh, that's cool. It has
my run, the distance. I

391
00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:23.970
ran kind of a little
graph of where I run

392
00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:25.920
around and we provide a
way to like, you know,

393
00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:27.810
make a unique to yourself,
you know, take a picture

394
00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:30.270
of where you ran or,
you know, I've completed this

395
00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:32.670
marathon and kind of shows
you the distance, your pace,

396
00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:36.060
your elevation. So all these
information is there. And you

397
00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:38.220
know, we're kind of unlocking
it through design and good

398
00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:41.100
engineering to provide the data
to all the users and

399
00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:42.900
kind of give you a
way kind of to show

400
00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:47.840
off your accomplishments. So what
data is stored, where, and

401
00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.000
for those of us who
are listening, who might be

402
00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:54.140
worried about privacy, like, what's,
what's the story there? Like,

403
00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:56.960
let me give you an
example. I just went to

404
00:18:56.990 --> 00:19:00.740
gyroscope to look at what
my, basically I went in

405
00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:04.760
incognito mode to see what
it says about me. And

406
00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:07.670
it says, Oh, well, this
person is private. So I'm

407
00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:09.680
like, okay, that's comforting. So
like, I can share with

408
00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:12.470
my friends. So my date
is private, but I'm on

409
00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:16.490
your website. And I can
see that you slept eight

410
00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:23.480
hours last night. So congratulations.
That's awesome. I'm like, he's

411
00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:25.670
a CTO. He probably sleeps
like three hours a night.

412
00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:27.380
Like, no, you had it.
Like, he slept pretty well.

413
00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:30.920
And it says here you're
97% productive. You've been online

414
00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:34.010
for the last five hours.
That's super interesting that I'm

415
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:37.040
looking about, you know, I
can see your, you got

416
00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:40.400
good blood pressure. Like, is
that, how do you feel

417
00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:43.010
about sharing that information and
how should people who are

418
00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:46.400
listening, feel about sharing or
not sharing their information. So

419
00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:48.230
there's two, two things here.
So as a person, who's

420
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:50.120
part of the company and
kind of wanting people to

421
00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:51.680
kind of share some more
of this stuff and kind

422
00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:53.630
of being open about it,
me and a non, both

423
00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:56.510
share all our stuff. We're
all our, all our pages

424
00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:58.640
are wide open. So you
can look at everything cause

425
00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:00.410
see how much I weighed.
Last time I weighed in

426
00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:02.240
all kinds of stuff, you
can see how much weight

427
00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:03.920
I've gained in the past
few weeks. Like you can

428
00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:05.990
look at everything like I'm
kind of an open book

429
00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:08.480
when it comes to stuff
like that it's being tracked

430
00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:10.550
somewhere else. So I have
no illusions of, you know,

431
00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:15.080
total privacy. There's obviously there's
some, you know, a modicum

432
00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:17.630
of privacy that I do
expect as a user. Who's

433
00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:20.840
giving this data away in
terms of our users. We're

434
00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:24.260
very diligent about that. Not
letting people, you know, being,

435
00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:26.330
let them being as much
control as they want. You

436
00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:29.880
can, you could completely lock
everything down. So the, the,

437
00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:32.480
so the card aspect that
I mentioned earlier, you can

438
00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:34.490
kind of use it both
publicly or just as a

439
00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:35.840
way to look at your
own data. And then you

440
00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:38.090
can choose to save the
card and share it with

441
00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:39.950
other people. Or you can
just keep it for yourself

442
00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:42.740
and it won't, won't be
posted anywhere and it's completely

443
00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:45.530
private. So the data is
all stored in our database.

444
00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:48.070
So once you sign up
an app, you connect things,

445
00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:50.830
we kind of keep track
of it for you. So

446
00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:52.660
over a period of time,
we go get your heart

447
00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:56.350
rates. We go get your,
your activity, your workouts, your

448
00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:58.840
productivity. We pull all that
in your blood pressure, your

449
00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:01.540
blood sugar, your ketones, we
pull it all in and

450
00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:03.130
we store it for you
and we keep it. So

451
00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:05.710
when a user decides to
leave the account, we blow

452
00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:09.340
it all the way. We
also give you granular and

453
00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:12.820
wide privacy. So wide being,
you can completely lock down

454
00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:15.670
your account. Nobody can see
anything. You can also do

455
00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:17.680
it so that only your
friends can see it. You

456
00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:19.720
can do it so that
you can turn off certain

457
00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:22.180
trends. So like, let's say
somebody's sensitive about their age

458
00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:27.610
or weight or where they've
been. You can, what's the

459
00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:30.360
word there. Granually turned each
of those off. It's it's

460
00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:32.670
funny that you point that
out because I'm pretty chill

461
00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:35.430
about like my blood sugar,
my weight, whatever I'll share

462
00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:37.410
that. But the thing that
I noticed was that it

463
00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:40.350
told me my age, like
down to the second and

464
00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:42.540
while I don't mind, I
mean, when knowing my age,

465
00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:45.270
it was a little depressing,
like watching my age, March

466
00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:48.060
forward into death. So that
was like the first thing

467
00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:49.350
I did. And I went
and I turned that off.

468
00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:51.870
Cause I don't like Absolutely.
So that was a feature

469
00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:54.810
that we got, we heard
feedback from a lot of

470
00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:56.730
users. I tend to like
it, it gives me like

471
00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:58.170
a little bit of sense
of urgency when I'm kind

472
00:21:58.170 --> 00:22:01.110
of doing things. And you
know, it depends on how

473
00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:03.060
you look at it. Really.
Some people, it freaks them

474
00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:06.030
out. So we gave them
a feature to turn that

475
00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:09.060
off completely. You know, there's,
there's tons of things that

476
00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:12.420
people just kinda like feel
different about. Yeah. Is on

477
00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:15.450
the granularity though. Like that
is totally granular. Like I

478
00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:18.870
turned off just that one
thing. But at the same

479
00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:21.390
time, like I'm looking at
the Explorer feature here because

480
00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:23.820
I've been using, I really
liked this because I've been

481
00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:29.730
using Foursquare when I travel
and in swarm. Right. But

482
00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:32.010
I've what have I done
with that data? Right? Like

483
00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:34.480
I'm, I'm the mayor of
a couple of places, but

484
00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:38.400
generally it's stupid. I plugged
that into gyroscope. It says

485
00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:42.750
I've been to 1,622 locations
in 24 countries in over

486
00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:47.340
300 cities. That's freaking cool.
It says here, like we

487
00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:51.000
went to, we went to
Disney world. So it's like,

488
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.460
yeah, you've been to theme
parks 18 times. And like,

489
00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:57.510
just this month I've been
to 11 airports. That's, that's

490
00:22:57.510 --> 00:23:00.120
incredible that you're going and
traveling that much, but that's

491
00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:01.980
awesome. I'll add you as
a friend. So you can

492
00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:04.740
like poke around and check
out my data. Because what

493
00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:07.500
I like about this though,
is that I've had my

494
00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:10.440
Apple watch for like a
year and the data goes

495
00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:12.660
off into Apple land, but
it doesn't give me any

496
00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:15.540
value. It's just, I got
this watch on and I've

497
00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:17.520
been using swarm and I
love it cause I use

498
00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:20.550
it to catch up with
friends. But seeing those things

499
00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:24.720
contextually, you know, I went
to 25 gyms and I

500
00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:28.500
have been, you know, 1.5
million steps, you know, but

501
00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:32.160
like over what point over
what period of time, what

502
00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:36.120
period of time, all of
that, that became interesting when

503
00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:40.590
you overlay the locations and
things like that. Absolutely. And

504
00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:42.390
like going back to the
point where the country even

505
00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:44.220
had a user who pinged
in going, Hey man, there's

506
00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:46.640
no way for me to
actually see what countries and

507
00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:48.710
I need to fill out
a visa application. And he

508
00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:52.010
based off the data, whereas
swarm data, he looked at

509
00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:54.170
Foursquare, they couldn't find anything.
And he's like, I connected

510
00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:56.270
it here. Do you guys
have any way of kind

511
00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:58.940
of showing that to me?
And two seconds later he

512
00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:01.190
had all the data and
he submitted that with an

513
00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:04.400
application. So there's tons of
stuff that you could use

514
00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:08.300
with collecting all that information,
kind of keeping it stored

515
00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:10.340
and everything. And then we
have a book that you

516
00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:12.680
kind of combine at the
end of the year that

517
00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:15.410
we put together custom for
every user. And it could

518
00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:16.970
be something you throw on
your coffee table as a

519
00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:19.700
discussion piece. So we pull
together all, even if you're

520
00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:22.310
private or not, we'll ask
to look at it. And

521
00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:24.830
then once we do that,
we kind of go through

522
00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:26.420
it and kind of give
you a design of how

523
00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:29.750
it potentially could look and
then give you the book.

524
00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:31.730
So your productivity, where you've
been nice pictures that you

525
00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:33.860
pull in. So we have
connections for Twitter and Instagram

526
00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:36.020
where you can pull it
in like, you know, pictures,

527
00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:38.810
you took on a trip
and things you can do

528
00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:40.670
like that. And then we
put it all into a

529
00:24:40.670 --> 00:24:43.880
book with all your, so
like Nick Felton's book where

530
00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:45.830
he does it every year,
where he talked to everybody

531
00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:47.510
and all that. But with
gyroscope where we kind of

532
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:49.610
pulled it all in kind
of give you a view

533
00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:52.630
of what you did that
year. It's really, it's really

534
00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:55.630
neat. People need to understand
that while we are, we

535
00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:59.050
can be freaked out about
privacy and about data. If

536
00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:01.810
we are given control of
that data, if we are

537
00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:03.280
put in control of that
day, we can do some

538
00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:08.050
really cool stuff. You know,
like some people are like,

539
00:25:08.050 --> 00:25:10.030
I'm not online. I don't
put any data online. I

540
00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:12.220
don't want any of that
information out there. That's fine.

541
00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:15.160
But like, as someone who's
diabetic with my blood sugar,

542
00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:18.640
being able to see, Hey,
I went to Atlanta, where

543
00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:21.400
did I eat? My blood
sugar was great. That, what

544
00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:23.230
does that relate to? Is
it the walk? Is it

545
00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:25.810
the location? Is it, you
know what, there's 20 different

546
00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:29.830
questions. I can ask myself
about why a day was

547
00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:32.650
a successful day and having
the tools to be able

548
00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:34.930
to figure that out is,
is really powerful. But I've

549
00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:36.340
been trying to mess around
with this stuff and like

550
00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:39.610
Excel. Yeah, it's a bit
of a task, right? Like

551
00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:40.990
after a while you can
do it for a little

552
00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:43.180
bit, but then you fall
off the wagon and you

553
00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:45.460
know, I'm a big effort
around what we've been doing

554
00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:47.890
with gyroscope is to keep
it as passive as possible,

555
00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:52.120
right? For, for the app
or the, or the human

556
00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:54.100
OS that we're trying to
build to ping you when

557
00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:56.620
things happen that are of
concern or to ping you,

558
00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:59.260
when, you know, you're, you're
outside of the ranges for

559
00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:00.940
certain things or ping you
when you set a goal

560
00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:02.740
and you're not reaching it,
you need it to be

561
00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:04.720
interactive with you in a
way that's not naggy, but

562
00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:06.520
in a way that's like,
Hey man, you kind of

563
00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:09.370
wanted to do this earlier
this week. What do you

564
00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:11.350
think? You still want to
kind of do that? And

565
00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:13.030
that's the way, the direction
we're kind of headed in

566
00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:16.630
terms of figuring out like
correlations between things and insights

567
00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:19.450
around these things. Even at
a company level for, you

568
00:26:19.450 --> 00:26:24.190
know, corporations often, you know,
provide like stipends to go

569
00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:25.960
to the gym or to
buy a bike or any

570
00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:29.860
type of gear. We have
like a super beta thing

571
00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:31.960
that we're kind of doing
with companies to kind of

572
00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:34.810
get everybody on board that
has integration with Slack and

573
00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:37.990
lets people, you know, give
kudos when we're doing things.

574
00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:41.200
And like, you know, company-wide
step graphs and all sorts

575
00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:43.090
of stuff at an aggregate
level. So people can kind

576
00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:45.480
of get a feel for
what everybody's into and what

577
00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:48.540
everybody's doing. And that's something
we we're really interested in

578
00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:52.490
expressing and showing off in
the future. Yeah. You said

579
00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:54.530
that you had noticed that
people were getting interested in

580
00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:57.650
blood sugar and I know
that that's pretty niche, but

581
00:26:57.860 --> 00:27:01.430
it is a thing that
I produce more blood sugar

582
00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:05.330
data than, than anyone. Right?
Like you might, you said

583
00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:07.190
that you were checking your
blood sugar. I assume you

584
00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:09.440
do it like once or
twice a day. And then

585
00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:12.410
you put it into the
app manually while I'm making

586
00:27:12.410 --> 00:27:15.230
it every five minutes because
I have an implanted sensor

587
00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:18.920
and I noticed that that
had caused some problems because

588
00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:21.050
when I tried to visit
one of your cards, it

589
00:27:21.050 --> 00:27:24.770
was generating slowly. So then
I ping you on Twitter

590
00:27:24.770 --> 00:27:27.200
and you had like fixed
that within like a day.

591
00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:32.720
How does that change your,
your, your architecture? Like some

592
00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:36.170
people might be producing passive
massive amounts of data and

593
00:27:36.170 --> 00:27:38.510
other people might throw in
their blood pressure data once

594
00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:41.150
or twice a month. So
granted, so yeah, so that

595
00:27:41.150 --> 00:27:43.310
problem tends to happen from
time to time. Blood sugar

596
00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:45.500
is one of our new
integrations and when we were

597
00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:47.180
building it, we're like, this
is kind of cool. So

598
00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:49.220
right now I have like
a one drop. It's just

599
00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:51.830
a simple finger prick and
it automatically writes it the

600
00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:53.600
health kit and then our
app pulls it up and

601
00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:55.970
pulls it into our site.
And it's there. So no

602
00:27:55.970 --> 00:27:58.790
big deal, right? Somebody like
you, who's got like an

603
00:27:58.790 --> 00:28:00.710
implant in their arm and
you're generating, you know, over

604
00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:03.230
the day, you're generating five
minutes probably in the thousands

605
00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:07.910
of data points. So that
over time you build up

606
00:28:07.910 --> 00:28:10.220
a lot more, right? So
in the day, a thousand

607
00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:12.980
in a year, you're doing
around 300,000, which is something

608
00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:14.900
we were prepared for with
blood heart rates, because we

609
00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:16.190
knew that was going to
be the case. People are

610
00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:19.430
wearing watches, generating minutely data
every few minutes. So we're

611
00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:21.200
aware of that when we're
kind of doing that thing.

612
00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.330
When we launched it, we
noticed a few people that

613
00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:26.150
were had like literally within
a minute of releasing, it

614
00:28:26.150 --> 00:28:28.820
had already half a million
records in our system. We're

615
00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:33.370
processing over we're processing we're
in a day, we're processing

616
00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:37.250
over 2 million data points coming
in through the system, be

617
00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:38.960
it running or heart rate
or whatever, it may be

618
00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:41.840
step graphs. So that was
one of the ones we've

619
00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:44.120
kind of found out over
time. We realized, Hey, there's

620
00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:46.700
a lot of people with
a lot of blood sugar

621
00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:50.180
data, so let's make this
so that it pulls in.

622
00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:52.520
And then obviously we had
to, you know, we're still

623
00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:54.500
working on it. We're reworking
the way the graphs work

624
00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:56.210
for those sorts of things
with people like yourself who

625
00:28:56.210 --> 00:29:01.640
have a lot of blood
sugar measurements, so want to

626
00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:04.400
give a car that's useful
for that versus, you know,

627
00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:07.130
the single data point after
lunch, I just kind of

628
00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:11.630
ate what's it at architecturally
wise, it was just a

629
00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:14.900
small change there, but like
we generally have support for,

630
00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:17.060
for things like that. It
was just us being, not

631
00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:19.700
aware of how many, how
many people are kind of

632
00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:23.660
collecting that much. Yeah. But
it sounds like the underlying

633
00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:27.200
background system is it supports
that idea of, you know,

634
00:29:27.290 --> 00:29:31.070
occasionally added data like blood
pressure and constantly added data

635
00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:34.160
like heart rate or in
my case, blood sugar. And

636
00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:35.690
then it sounds like you're
thinking about that. And then

637
00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:38.000
I went and I, I
just to make sure people

638
00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:44.830
know, like being transparent here
within about 15 minutes of

639
00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:48.910
playing with gyroscope, I signed
up for the pro the

640
00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:52.600
pro features, which gives me
more reports and premium features.

641
00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:55.720
So I basically did the
unlock. I got new layouts,

642
00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:58.660
new cards, I got the
AI sleep tracking and I'll

643
00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:01.300
get the annual report as
well, which is pretty sweet.

644
00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:03.640
So I was super happy
about that. And I may,

645
00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:06.250
I may plug it into
my custom domain so I

646
00:30:06.250 --> 00:30:10.390
could actually have like gyroscope
dot, you know, something Hanselman

647
00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:13.330
like some demand on your
main domain. Yeah, that's absolutely

648
00:30:13.330 --> 00:30:14.920
cool. So I have it
set up like that. That's

649
00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:16.690
where I direct everybody when
they kind of want to

650
00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:19.750
see where I'm at. There's
a cool thing that we

651
00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:22.360
also do is DNA. So,
so if you've ever done

652
00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:26.410
a 23 me analysis, I
did actually great. So we

653
00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:28.240
can kind of, you can
kind of plug that in

654
00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:30.430
as a pro feature as
well. And you know, in

655
00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:32.800
the future, we hope to
pull in that insight from

656
00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:35.680
your DNA into that. So,
you know, if you have

657
00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:38.680
a certain muscle type that
lends itself better to weightlifting

658
00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:40.720
than running and you know,
we starting to see that

659
00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:42.100
you're starting to working out,
we can kind of give

660
00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:44.830
you suggestions around that at
the moment. It's kind of

661
00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:46.660
just cool stuff about yourself.
You can kind of keep

662
00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:49.000
around with you, but in
the future, we plan to

663
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.510
leverage that, to kind of
give you more, more insight

664
00:30:52.510 --> 00:30:55.000
about yourself and what you
should and should not be

665
00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.210
doing. I, I'm pretty sure
that I do not have

666
00:30:58.270 --> 00:31:02.980
the special DNA that makes
me extra fit, but thanks

667
00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:05.370
for, thanks for reminding me
of that. I do not

668
00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:08.140
have I'm sure. I'm sure
you have something else that

669
00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:11.590
makes you special. I'm sure
I probably have something, but

670
00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:13.930
I'm pretty sure that that's
not it. I may have

671
00:31:13.930 --> 00:31:16.360
hurt myself doing squats yesterday
though. So I have to

672
00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:20.080
enter that into the, into
the system. There's injury tracking

673
00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:21.880
too. Like we're starting to
expand our, you know, our

674
00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:24.910
insights around these things and
kind of, cause in order

675
00:31:24.910 --> 00:31:27.010
to provide you some insight
around this stuff, we kind

676
00:31:27.010 --> 00:31:29.470
of have to kind of
collect information and we take

677
00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:31.810
it very seriously. We know
that, you know, that information,

678
00:31:32.050 --> 00:31:34.930
not everybody feels comfortable sharing
with everyone. And you know,

679
00:31:34.930 --> 00:31:36.940
we, we go to, we
go to some lengths to

680
00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:39.220
provide you most of the
control and all as much

681
00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:42.100
as we can. And we
do take a lot of

682
00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:46.270
conscientious effort around keeping that
secure as possible and not

683
00:31:46.270 --> 00:31:49.990
letting anybody access it. Yeah.
I've been totally impressed with

684
00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:53.140
it. Everything is using like,
you know, author, the different

685
00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:54.760
thing, you know, I'm not
putting my password into your

686
00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:58.330
thing. Each one of these
is a connected app. So

687
00:31:58.330 --> 00:32:00.490
I, you know, I gave
you explicit access to my

688
00:32:00.490 --> 00:32:03.280
health kit or to my
moves data or to my

689
00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:06.460
scale. And I can turn
any of that off whenever

690
00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:10.120
I feel like it's so
I'm definitely digging it. And

691
00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:13.630
you said to be clear,
your like how y'all are

692
00:32:13.630 --> 00:32:16.990
gonna make money as a
startup is through pro and

693
00:32:16.990 --> 00:32:19.600
through, I assume like, you
know, insurance companies and companies

694
00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:22.090
and stuff, not from selling
my stuff, we're, we're still

695
00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:24.220
looking into various ways, but
the main way we make

696
00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:27.010
money right now is through
prescriptions. Like there is no,

697
00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:29.620
there is no goal, like
to turn your information over

698
00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:31.660
to the man, like we're
we want to build a

699
00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:34.960
product that provides value to
people and provides improvements over

700
00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:38.590
their health. We have tons
of blog posts around people

701
00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:40.670
that have like, you know,
had a heart Attack and

702
00:32:40.670 --> 00:32:43.370
came back around and use
gyroscope to kind of get

703
00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:45.980
them more motivated to doing
runs. And you can find

704
00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:48.650
all that stuff on our
blog, but our goal is

705
00:32:48.650 --> 00:32:51.860
not to sell your data.
Like they're, you know, there

706
00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:53.450
are companies that end up
doing that sort of thing,

707
00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:55.610
and that's not where we're
headed. And we want to

708
00:32:55.610 --> 00:32:58.550
kind of provide value directly
to you through the use

709
00:32:58.550 --> 00:33:00.410
of the app and through
our pro features and provide

710
00:33:00.410 --> 00:33:03.410
as much insight. And that's
where we're headed next. We've

711
00:33:03.410 --> 00:33:05.690
kind of gone through the
phase of, you know, data

712
00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:08.000
aggregation, getting all the data
and now all your stuff's

713
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.280
kind of in our system.
The next set of steps

714
00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:12.500
is trying to give you,
you know, insights to, you

715
00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:15.110
may not be able to
see, right? Like, Oh, like

716
00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:18.140
year over year improvement. Like
one, when you finish a

717
00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:20.060
run, is that one of
your best runs when you

718
00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:22.360
do, when you consistently worked
out more than you ever

719
00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:25.850
worked out kind of insights
around your behavior. So let's

720
00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:27.260
say, you know, you kind
of break your leg, you're

721
00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:29.480
walking a lot less. We
can kind of give you,

722
00:33:29.510 --> 00:33:31.310
let you know that, you
know, this is affected you

723
00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:33.800
in that way. You may
know, but in cases where

724
00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:35.600
there are things that you
may not realize that are

725
00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:38.270
happening, your blood sugar is
kind of spiking. You're eating

726
00:33:38.270 --> 00:33:39.980
more of these habits that
you generate on a day

727
00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:43.490
to day basis, but have
serious impacts over the longterm.

728
00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:47.000
We're trying to provide more
insight around that. We recently

729
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.860
hired a new head of
data science. Who's going to

730
00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:51.860
be focusing on that in
the next six months. And

731
00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:54.470
I'm really excited about the
future, because if you can,

732
00:33:54.890 --> 00:33:56.900
if you can get together
all the information that you're

733
00:33:57.080 --> 00:34:00.200
putting out there, right. With
context, there's a lot of

734
00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:03.380
insights that you can unlock,
right? Am I sleeping better?

735
00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:07.700
Is my, is my workouts
overall? Am I getting more

736
00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:11.360
fit as my heart rate,
like decreasing over time as

737
00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:13.880
I'm walking out, are there
ways that I can improve

738
00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:16.130
how I'm working out? There's
all this information is there.

739
00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:18.020
And there's a lot of
companies that are doing a

740
00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:21.440
lot of this biohacking and
kind of doing a lot

741
00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:23.870
of stuff worthy. You know,
it takes supplements and doing

742
00:34:23.870 --> 00:34:26.600
all that sort of stuff
and actually measuring how those

743
00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:29.960
things affect you. Right? Is,
is the difference measurable? Is

744
00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:32.120
it actually worth it? And
you know, we plan to

745
00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:34.520
be the operating system around
that and kind of, you

746
00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:36.170
can at a glance, get
a look at what's going

747
00:34:36.170 --> 00:34:39.530
on with your body and
how you're feeling and unlocking

748
00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:42.560
that potential for the human.
Very cool. Well, I really

749
00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:44.360
appreciate you taking the time
to chat with me today.

750
00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:47.810
Thank you so much. This
has been another episode of

751
00:34:47.810 --> 00:34:50.270
Hanselminutes and we'll see you
again next week.
