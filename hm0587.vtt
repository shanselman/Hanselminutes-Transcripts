Hi, this is Scott Hanselman.

8
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.670
This is another episode of
Hansel minutes. And today on

9
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.520
the show we've got Brandon
<inaudible>. He's an engineer at

10
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.910
the defense digital service, and
you're calling me from the

11
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.490
Pentagon right now. Yes, sir.
It is true. You're like

12
00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:03.140
legit inside the seat of
power right now. I'm on,

13
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.470
I'm on one of the
sides of the five-sided seat

14
00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.120
of power. Yes. Cool. I
re I read some spy

15
00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.940
novel and they were talking
about like the multiple rings

16
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.010
within the Pentagon. Like how
many rings are you in?

17
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.060
Right. There are well, five
rings in the five sided

18
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.610
box that is depending on
and the five floors. So

19
00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.810
I am on the fifth
floor and the technically the

20
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.650
D ring, which is the
second to outermost ring. Outermost

21
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.500
ring is the E ring.
I have no idea what

22
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.360
any of that means, but
it is impressive. And I

23
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.440
appreciate it. Thank you so
much for talking to me

24
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.030
today, this concept of digital
service, this, that, that phrasing,

25
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.460
or maybe that branding that
feels new, but I know

26
00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.160
that there've been it people
running around the government since

27
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.720
the beginning. Yes, you're right.
It does feel new. And

28
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.080
in many ways it absolutely
is new. The, the idea

29
00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.040
of a digital service, especially
as it's represented by the

30
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.100
United States digital service and us
at the defense digital service

31
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.310
is to try to bring,
you know, private sector, best

32
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.800
practices of software development and
technology to government to help

33
00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.060
make government processes that leverage
technology much more efficient. I,

34
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.390
I think it kind of
is pretty genuine, real knowledge

35
00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.010
at this point that most
government systems from a technological

36
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.210
standpoint can stand to use
some improvement. And so the

37
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:35.390
digital services were created to
foster the doing exactly that.

38
00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.420
And so we try to
bring in that top technical

39
00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.480
talent, that's working at the
big name companies like the

40
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.330
Googles, the Facebooks, the Amazons,
the Microsofts of the world

41
00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.020
to come in and do
what we call a, almost

42
00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.600
like a it's a digital
tour of duty, almost like

43
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.270
a peace Corps for nerds
almost to come in and

44
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.430
leverage their technical skills to
try to see if they

45
00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.530
can make those same type
of improvements within the government

46
00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.610
environment setting. So that all
citizens that the government serve

47
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.170
can benefit. That's really interesting.
So because we don't typically

48
00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.420
think of that being, working
for the government and certainly

49
00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.480
working in it for the
governor to be glamorous. But

50
00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.940
if you've got a team
with former Google employees and

51
00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.930
Shopify employees doing work on
modern stacks, doing modern things,

52
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.960
that seems more, much more
compelling and pretty darn interesting.

53
00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.050
Actually, It's very interesting. And
now to be fair, you

54
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.300
know, not all of his
glamorous, sometimes the things that

55
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.480
we do are the things
that a lot of people

56
00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.100
who do this for a
living in the private sector

57
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.550
take completely for granted. It's
just assumed that you would

58
00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.520
have something like, for example,
version control in your development

59
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.070
environment, things like that. And
then you walk into government

60
00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.500
and you realize people don't
even know what that might

61
00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.630
mean in some cases. And
so you, you do things

62
00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.450
that you would consider to
be rudimentary or baseline, and

63
00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.850
they look at you like
you're some powerful wizard. And

64
00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.520
then there are other times
where you're truly, truly doing

65
00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.970
some pretty cool stuff. Or
even from a technical standpoint

66
00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.110
is relatively mundane from an
impact standpoint. It is just,

67
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.690
I mean, for some people,
it's the greatest thing that

68
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.080
overdue Is it that things
move slowly. And when they

69
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.750
moving slowly, what are you
doing? Are you sitting around

70
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.270
or are you like, people
always say that in government

71
00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.940
things move slowly, are you
saying that things like let's

72
00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.490
say continuous integration or a
build server is a big

73
00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.680
deal or that it just
might be foreign to some

74
00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.400
branches of the government? It's
a little bit from my

75
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.540
vantage point is a little
bit of all of the

76
00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:29.790
above it's things do move
slowly in government. I am

77
00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.040
a little bit different from
many of my counterparts here

78
00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.340
at USDS and DDS because
I myself have been in

79
00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.480
government for about 14 years
now, usually at the local

80
00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.490
wind local state level. And
this is now a year

81
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.130
in almost a year and
a half in federal level.

82
00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.750
So I'm familiar with how
the government bureaucracy operates and

83
00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.240
things do move more slowly.
And there's a lot of

84
00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.370
processes involved, a lot of
processes involved. And so, yeah,

85
00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.090
it does cause things that
would normally happen much more

86
00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.270
rapidly in the private sector
for various reasons to take

87
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.900
much longer. But it's also
sometimes just a genuine lack

88
00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:13.650
of lack of knowledge. There's
the incentives are different. If

89
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.010
a technological, if a technology
company in private sector does

90
00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.160
not innovate and keep up
to speed with technology, they

91
00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.520
can find themselves quickly eclipsed
or even going out of

92
00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.540
business by their rivals governments.
Don't really have that problem.

93
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.020
And that's a double edged
sword because it means that

94
00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.970
there is no strong incentive
in many cases to continuously

95
00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.640
iterate and stay up to
date with modern technology practices

96
00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:43.050
and procedures. So it allows
software to tend to stagnate

97
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.910
because you know, it ain't
broke, don't fix it. And

98
00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.270
so when we come in,
we faced as the bureaucracies

99
00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.700
because like the old joke,
I like to say governments

100
00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.590
hate to things change. And
the way things currently are.

101
00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.060
So you hear people who
are not happy with the

102
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.300
way things are going, and
processes are a pain and

103
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:10.370
systems are problematic and user
interfaces don't work and applications

104
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.170
don't talk to each other
and data is not transferred,

105
00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:14.960
but you also feel a
lot of resistance when we

106
00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.240
come in and we're doing
things at a much faster

107
00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.630
pace, using more modern tools
that they're completely unfamiliar with

108
00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:25.040
and continuously engaging with users
and getting their feedback. When

109
00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.480
the assumption is you only
have to talk to them

110
00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.040
once, then you go in
the back room and build

111
00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:32.870
it. You're done. So there's,
it's a mixture of everything

112
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:37.090
you mentioned really. Is it
that, I mean, I'm assuming,

113
00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.910
because it's a certain amount
of mystique around a software

114
00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:42.880
that we don't understand, right?
Like before I worked at

115
00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.000
a bank, the idea of
moving money with software, it

116
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.540
seems like such a bigger
deal than, you know, writing

117
00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:54.280
a blog and writing software
for government or for defense

118
00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:57.970
seems almost scary in the
like people's lives are on

119
00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:00.610
the line. This is a
big deal. Like software quality

120
00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:05.380
matters more. Is that an
appropriate or a correct sense

121
00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:07.030
that I should have? Is
there a certain amount of

122
00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:10.390
fear in like, I don't
want to mess things up,

123
00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:11.800
so we have to move
a little slower with a

124
00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.770
little more determinism, because this
is such important. That is

125
00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:18.370
it's funny. You say that
because in some cases, especially

126
00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:20.980
here at the DOD, that's
usually what gets passed on

127
00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:24.790
to us from the folks.
The other folks within the

128
00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:27.340
government that we're working with,
this is, is a critical

129
00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:30.700
system. So it's extremely important.
We can't afford to run

130
00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.400
the risk of making changes
that won't work. What if

131
00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:37.060
it breaks, yada yada yada.
And so there, you hear

132
00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:41.890
a lot of lip service
paid to that. You, but

133
00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:44.080
then you, you know, you
peel back the onion a

134
00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:47.830
little bit and you see
sometimes that the current system

135
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:53.050
that is up and running
is using outdated proprietary software

136
00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:57.790
that has long since passed
it's it's dates, where it's

137
00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:00.940
being given regular security, patches
and updates. So it's extremely

138
00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:05.020
vulnerable. You see legacy systems
that may have been homegrown

139
00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.290
by people who have long
since left government and may

140
00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:12.160
have retired and are aren't
actually even being maintained, but

141
00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:17.260
are serving critical functions. But
if that hardware goes down,

142
00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.800
they're absolutely Sol. So you,
you see a lot of

143
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.900
that. So you see, you
see that the systems as

144
00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:26.410
they operate, do not necessarily
reflect what they believe that

145
00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:30.640
they're doing. Oftentimes this may
be do the institutional knowledge.

146
00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:33.700
You know, some person somewhere
15 years ago may have

147
00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.160
hack something together in order
to get the project done.

148
00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:40.150
And now, because it's operational,
there's a sh and that

149
00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:42.940
person is gone. It's become
like, you know, you can't

150
00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:46.000
touch that. That's, that's the
magic. And if you break

151
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.690
that that's over. And so
that, that fosters a lot

152
00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:53.770
of resistance, especially in a
world where you don't have

153
00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:57.390
modern tool sets or modern
development practices, things like dev

154
00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:04.620
ops, you know, automated builds
unit, automated testing or testing

155
00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:07.350
period, that doesn't involve a
person clicking a button repeatedly,

156
00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:12.660
things like that, those things
that give modern developers, this

157
00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:17.250
assurance that they can afford
to make changes without breaking

158
00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:19.230
the whole thing. And they
can afford to be a

159
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:21.060
bit more daring and a
bit more creative of what

160
00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:23.280
they're doing when you, when
you lose all of that,

161
00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:27.180
you become much more rigid
and much more focused on

162
00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:30.120
keeping, maintaining the status quo.
And so a lot of

163
00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:33.960
what we do is in
instructing and helping people understand

164
00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:35.970
that there is a, there
literally is a better way

165
00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:39.840
of doing this, you know,
and bring that in. And

166
00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:42.450
we try to lead by
example by either helping to

167
00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:44.130
inform them of the right
of way and showing them

168
00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:47.190
that way and going so
far as to actually do

169
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:49.650
it and put it in,
show them like here here's

170
00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:53.370
the finished product use that.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. The,

171
00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:56.150
the, some of the things
that the defense digital service

172
00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:59.390
that you did, that I
would never have expected from

173
00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:02.210
any kind of government agency,
for example, was like the

174
00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:06.230
hack, the Pentagon program. They,
it was a bug bounty

175
00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:08.300
program. It was like the
first one in the history

176
00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:11.060
of the fed to go
and say, the federal government

177
00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:13.520
to say, Hey, let's go
and do a formal bug

178
00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:16.400
bounty and bring the us
department of defense onto this

179
00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:19.430
hacker one platform, and actually
have people, you know, pay

180
00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:22.550
people to find bugs is
something that you all did

181
00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:25.760
last year. And I'm surprised
that they were able to

182
00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:29.120
go and like sell the
idea, but it found like,

183
00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.640
you know, 200 reports in
the first six hours and

184
00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:35.660
paid off some reasonable amount
of bounties. But certainly the

185
00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:38.630
value that was created out
of that was, you know,

186
00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:41.450
far outweighs any of the
risks or the, the bug

187
00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:44.440
bounties that were paid pretty
good. Right. It does the

188
00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:48.500
value far exceeded. And that's
why, first of all, you're

189
00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:52.010
absolutely correct. There was a
not no, but hell no

190
00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:55.790
response with the initial plan
to do appreciate you. I

191
00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:58.610
appreciate your candor. Yes. I
mean, even the name hack,

192
00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:04.550
the Pentagon was hotly debated
and resisted fiercely our, our

193
00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:08.690
director of DDS, Chris Lynch
was adamant about, you know,

194
00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:11.420
keeping the name and making
it happen. And this was

195
00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:13.400
an example of us saying,
we're just gonna do it.

196
00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:16.940
We definitely needed to top
over support. We have been

197
00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:20.810
fortunate to have the full
support of the previous secretary

198
00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:23.720
of defense Ash Carter and
the current secretary of defense

199
00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:27.860
James Mattis, who, you know,
they really believe what we're

200
00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:32.150
doing the other top level
commanders within the DOD believe

201
00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:35.150
what we're doing. And so
you're absolutely right. There was

202
00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:37.640
a lot of resistance because
it's just so different. So

203
00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:42.050
new, they were accustomed to
paying exorbitant contracts to red

204
00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:44.870
teams and pen testers to
do this work. I think

205
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:47.690
they did right before we
launched hack the Pentagon and

206
00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:51.200
found, I think maybe 20
vulnerabilities. And then we do

207
00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.350
hack the Pentagon for, I
believe, or roughly an, of

208
00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:56.410
magnitude less money. And they
find the first one within

209
00:11:56.410 --> 00:12:02.440
six hours and find hundreds
of vulnerabilities. And so once

210
00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:06.010
again, leading by example, showing
them how it's different, they

211
00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:08.020
can see it with their
own eyes. And to this

212
00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:11.170
day we've done hack the
army. We're currently, as we

213
00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:15.790
speak doing a hack, the
air force, and there are

214
00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:18.880
plans, a new policy was
developed as a result of

215
00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:22.150
the hack, the Pentagon approach.
So now other government agencies

216
00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:26.590
are running their own hack,
the whatever agency, right. So

217
00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:30.150
it really has made a
change. Yeah. And what's exciting

218
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:32.610
about that. And what I
was really impressed about from

219
00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:37.200
a transparency perspective was that
they chose a live asset.

220
00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.600
They didn't make a honeypot.
They said, okay, here's a

221
00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:41.460
live asset. We're going to
choose as the target for

222
00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:44.910
the hackers. Something that's, you
know, always under constant attack,

223
00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:47.340
but doesn't have anything, you
know, you're not trying to

224
00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:49.920
give away secrets or stuff
to get no personally identifiable

225
00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:52.320
information, but it's still a
real thing. You know, it's

226
00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.270
like, if we're going to
do this, let's not do

227
00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:57.240
it for fake. Let's do
it for real. And it

228
00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:59.190
was like 13 minutes from
the moment you launched it

229
00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:02.910
until they found a vulnerability
and everybody wins the white

230
00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:05.340
hat, not the black hat,
but the white hat, the

231
00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:08.400
good hacker who helps out,
they get the, you know,

232
00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:10.350
the ability to go and
say, Hey, I worked on

233
00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:13.860
the hack, the Pentagon hack.
And then every other system

234
00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:17.040
that the Pentagon uses can
then learn from that hack

235
00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:20.040
and improve its security. Exactly.
In fact, that was the

236
00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:23.910
reason why we were so
adamant about doing his life

237
00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:27.000
sites, because believe me, they
wanted to go against like

238
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.480
a honeypot and everything. And
we were like, no, because

239
00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:33.150
you're gonna, you know, the
honeypot is not reflective of

240
00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:36.180
the actual live site traffic.
You're going to try to

241
00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:39.750
fix things or put things
in place before, as you

242
00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:42.510
built, the honeypot was like,
that's not, that's not how

243
00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:44.880
it would really work. This
is opposed to mimic to

244
00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:47.400
a good extent what it
would be like if a

245
00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:50.070
hacker actually was able to
get into your system. And

246
00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:52.110
you want to understand that
because you don't have good

247
00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:54.690
replication in your honeypot of
what the actual production network

248
00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:58.770
is like. So we're, we
pushed on that. They agreed.

249
00:13:58.770 --> 00:14:01.500
And they'd been happy and
pleased with the results so

250
00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:06.240
far. And the, the people
who have participated in these

251
00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.460
events, I mean, hack the
Pentagon. I think one of

252
00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:12.690
the folks who participated was
these youngest 17, that person,

253
00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:17.760
along with others who found
some critical vulnerabilities were actually

254
00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:20.910
received challenge coins and met
with the secretary of defense.

255
00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:23.520
Can you imagine that? I
don't know what it would

256
00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:25.080
have liked if I met
the secretary of state when

257
00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:27.330
I was 17 years old,
because I had the DOD

258
00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:30.390
website, this is ridiculous. I
think you'd rather meet them

259
00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:32.760
in person than like, you
know, but with bars between

260
00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:38.400
you and them. Exactly. You're,
you're absolutely right. But it's

261
00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:41.700
been, it's been great. And
it's been a great move.

262
00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:43.140
And like you said, it's
kind of a, win-win on

263
00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:45.600
all sides here. Yeah. It's
pretty, it's a pretty forward

264
00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:48.000
thinking stuff. One other thing
that I was impressed with

265
00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:50.640
is this experiment. I don't
know how far this has

266
00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:53.210
gone, but the idea that
if you go to code

267
00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:58.640
C O D e.mil, that
domain and mil domain military

268
00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:02.120
top level domain goes to
a GitHub repository, which is

269
00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:04.640
an experiment that the DOD
is doing to, you know,

270
00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:08.150
maybe host some code on
GitHub and start open-sourcing, that's

271
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:12.710
pretty impressive stuff. Is that
driven from places like the,

272
00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:15.470
the defense digital service, or
how do, how do people

273
00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:18.010
decide who owns what in
these kinds of systems? Well,

274
00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:21.040
that was the, that's a
whole creation of the defenses

275
00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:23.230
will serve as, and it
started with a very simple

276
00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:26.320
approach. We were simply asking
a question as we were

277
00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:29.080
writing different pieces of code
for different projects we were

278
00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:32.710
working on. You're like, how
do we open sources code?

279
00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:36.340
You know, most of us
leverage open source code all

280
00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:40.780
the time as most modern
developers do. And we are

281
00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:44.620
accustomed. And we use GitHub
internally in order to keep

282
00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:46.900
track of our project work
as we're doing. And so

283
00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:49.030
we're like, yeah, we wrote
this code for this project,

284
00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:51.580
whether it was snippet or
full fledged application. And like,

285
00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:54.700
how do we open source
it? And we were fortunate

286
00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:58.150
enough to have a great
general counsel Sharon Woods on our

287
00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:04.180
team who loves to research
things like this. She knew

288
00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:06.580
very little about open source
at the beginning. She is

289
00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:11.170
now an open source expert
now. And we come to

290
00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:14.050
realize a quick flaw, cause
we're thinking, Oh, we just

291
00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:16.570
slap it like MIT or
GPL license on this thing

292
00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:18.430
and release it. It'll be
good. Like you do anything

293
00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:21.730
you want open source sources,
pick your license. It turns

294
00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:25.390
out as a government employee,
you have no copyright, none,

295
00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:29.860
any work you do in
a government domain has zero

296
00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:34.270
copyright. So even, you know,
a very copyleft license like

297
00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:39.940
the GPL, for example, doesn't
automatically apply because even those

298
00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:45.040
licenses assume you have copyright.
And so we said, Oh

299
00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:47.230
crap, this is not as
simple as we thought. So

300
00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:49.870
we try to figure out
ways. And we were so

301
00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:52.660
fortunate to have a lawyer
involved because you know, oftentimes

302
00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:54.730
from a developer standpoint, you
don't have a lawyer at

303
00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:57.250
present to give you advice
on this stuff, as you're

304
00:16:57.250 --> 00:16:59.620
trying to figure out how
to license your software. And

305
00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:02.680
so we literally reached out
to the free software foundation.

306
00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:05.830
We reached out to the
open source initiative and, you

307
00:17:05.830 --> 00:17:08.350
know, explained our situation and
what we're thinking of doing.

308
00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:11.710
They got really interested. And
so we came up with

309
00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:15.430
what we thought was a
good idea to re release

310
00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:17.710
a software. And we were
thinking, Hey, how about we

311
00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:20.260
actually put our process, Oh,
how are we going to

312
00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:23.560
do this on GitHub? And
let people like any other

313
00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:27.220
process, you know, file issues
and complaints about the way

314
00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:29.290
we're thinking of open source
and software and boy, Oh

315
00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:33.520
boy, did we get complaints
about our initial process? We

316
00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:36.730
got a lot of feedback,
including some pretty good names

317
00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:40.150
in the free software and
open source community. And we

318
00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:44.410
literally changed our approach as
a result and, you know,

319
00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:48.670
release the new version of
our open source agreement. And

320
00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:53.700
we have since released a
few pieces of software using

321
00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:58.740
the developer certificate of origin
and invite people to contribute.

322
00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:03.060
Cause private contributors of course
have copyright. And we ask

323
00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:05.820
that they leverage the license
that we provide. And it

324
00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:08.880
seems to be a very
pragmatic approach that all parties

325
00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:12.360
involved go for it because
we engage the community, not

326
00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:15.510
just to contribute to the
software. We induce the community

327
00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:18.240
to help us identify good
way that you can contribute

328
00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:20.850
to the software. And that
was, that was novel. So

329
00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:22.680
now we're working on trying
to see, we can get

330
00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:25.740
more people within the DOD
cause there are a lot

331
00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:28.820
of developers within the DOD
who write software and elect

332
00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:30.540
to open sources. So we're
working with them to see

333
00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:33.210
if we can get them
out on a platform and

334
00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:36.300
develop what we hope is
a community by which people

335
00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:39.060
who may not, you know,
work within the government, but

336
00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:44.700
have technical skill can contribute
to actual government used software,

337
00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:46.620
just like we would contribute
to any other piece of

338
00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:49.070
open source software. One of
the things that you said

339
00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:50.840
that I want to kind
of kind of double click

340
00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:53.300
on, for lack of a
better word was you said

341
00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:58.400
it's a very pragmatic approach.
And that seems really powerful.

342
00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:02.900
I mean, you're basically saying
let's leapfrog the time that

343
00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:06.620
we spent in government and
maybe not being using progressive

344
00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:09.680
software technologies think that that
the, the old style slow

345
00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:11.720
moving it of the fifties
and sixties and maybe the

346
00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:13.610
seventies is going to get
leapfrogged. We're going to start

347
00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:15.830
using things like get and
get hub. We're going to

348
00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:17.510
use open source licenses. We're
going to reach out to

349
00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:20.000
the community, whether it be
having them hack our live

350
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.720
asset or whether it be
opening up things for, for

351
00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:26.390
comment on GitHub or using
GitHub issues. That's kind of

352
00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:32.600
very progressive, very thoughtful, very
modern techniques. You say, you

353
00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:35.120
get pushback though. Like you're
getting pushback from people saying,

354
00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:37.700
well, this isn't how it's
been done in the past.

355
00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:40.340
What are you using as
metrics to prove that this

356
00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:43.760
is the right way to
do things? Are you, did

357
00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:46.700
you have, you know, key
performance indicators that you can

358
00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:49.730
point to, to keep senators
from saying shut this down

359
00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:52.460
or shut that down? Well,
we have different metrics depending

360
00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:56.720
on the different project. Oh,
the overall our strategy is

361
00:19:56.750 --> 00:20:00.500
what are the founder of
USDS? Todd park then CTO

362
00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:04.970
United States said, and that is
the strategy is delivery. And

363
00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:07.910
I agree with that 100%
and success is the metric.

364
00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.500
Success is the metric that
we have qualitative and quantitative

365
00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:17.030
metrics from a qualitative standpoint
is simple. There are some

366
00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:20.300
projects that they're done here
at the DOD that you

367
00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:24.290
literally the problem statement, defining
the problem alone because of

368
00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:27.650
bureaucratic processes can take a
year and a half. And

369
00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:31.100
that's before you even start
things like trying to create

370
00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:33.440
the actual requirements and then
procured a software by that

371
00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:35.090
time, by the time you
selected all of this and

372
00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:37.940
they actually start developing until
the time they're done the

373
00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:40.430
software in the system is
already out of date. You

374
00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:43.700
know, I've had to remind
people here, the DOD and

375
00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:48.010
the government that 10 years
ago, smartphones didn't exist. And

376
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:50.260
yet you have some projects
that are going on longer

377
00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:54.550
than 10 years before they're
even done, that's taking too

378
00:20:54.550 --> 00:21:00.370
long. So our process is
to just get stuff done.

379
00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:04.510
We literally have the posters
that say, get stuff done,

380
00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:09.760
except it doesn't say stuff.
And we are always trying

381
00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:11.440
to get this thing in
front of people's faces. We

382
00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:13.780
do the agile approach. We
do kind of get generated

383
00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:16.690
MVP. I've been in government
long enough to know that

384
00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:18.400
this is what works you
can say, it's going to

385
00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:21.100
be done. You can tell
people, pay lip service, all

386
00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:22.570
you want until they see
something in front of their

387
00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:25.810
face. They don't really buy
it or believe it, the

388
00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:28.360
metrics that we use very
like forward the heck, depending

389
00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:31.510
on it. You mentioned earlier,
the metrics were quite obvious

390
00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:34.540
as simple. It cost an
order of magnitude, less money

391
00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:38.410
to get an order of
magnitude, more vulnerabilities discovered, fixed

392
00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:46.330
and patched. That's just, self-explanatory
with one of the things

393
00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:52.030
we did for, for trans
comp, where they had a

394
00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:55.540
system that helps military families
move, it's actually moved out

395
00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:59.380
mill. And there was a
problem with the system and

396
00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:05.380
where it was actually having
difficulties scheduling, coordinating people to

397
00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:07.210
be able to move when
they're redeployed to a new

398
00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:09.670
location. And this was affecting
not just the military members,

399
00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:13.530
but their families. We were
asked to come in and

400
00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:17.230
in four days we were
able to stand the system

401
00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:19.330
back up and get it
to a point where it

402
00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:24.160
had much higher uptime from
about 80% to 99.9%. And

403
00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:28.900
it was processing many more
move requests than it was

404
00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:35.590
before thousands more. And so
those are obvious metrics. And

405
00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:39.640
so you, we, we certainly
have the quantitative metrics, but

406
00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:43.420
we also have the qualitative
ones. And one big qualitative.

407
00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:45.820
One is the fact that
we engage with the users.

408
00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:48.970
This is such a novel
concept to people in the

409
00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:52.330
government. It's is sometimes astounding.
Now I am not a

410
00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:54.910
user researcher. We have user
researchers who do this for

411
00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:57.070
a living on our team.
I am not one, but

412
00:22:57.070 --> 00:23:00.580
even I recognize because I
do develop software that, you

413
00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:02.850
know, you need to continuously
engage with your users. You,

414
00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:04.510
you talk to them and
you figure out what their

415
00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:06.940
needs are, what their problems
are. You get that MVP

416
00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:08.920
in front of her face.
And you continually iterate with

417
00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:12.580
the user involvement to make
things work. And from a

418
00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:16.030
qualitative standpoint, they are so
happy with the result because

419
00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:18.670
they helped make it happen.
That they are much more

420
00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:22.060
likely to use and enjoy
the system. Then they would

421
00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:25.300
be, if you talk to
them once or more likely,

422
00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:26.980
especially in a place at
the DOD, you don't talk

423
00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:29.290
to the users. You talk
to like the top level

424
00:23:29.290 --> 00:23:32.110
stakeholders and chain of command.
And then you go off

425
00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:35.110
to some facility somewhere and
do all the coding there.

426
00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:38.500
And then you present the
finished project. And then that's

427
00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:40.420
when the users are engaged.
And they're like, what is

428
00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:42.010
this? This doesn't really do
what I want. And I

429
00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:44.320
guess I have to live
with it now. And they're

430
00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:47.270
perpetually not happy with the
software, which means the customers,

431
00:23:47.290 --> 00:23:51.050
AKA American citizens are oftentimes
not happy with the result.

432
00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:54.490
I want to pivot a
little bit, But in the

433
00:23:54.490 --> 00:23:56.930
time that we have remaining
and ask you a question

434
00:23:56.930 --> 00:23:58.960
that when you, when we
met for the first time

435
00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:01.800
we were chatting for a
while and was I correct

436
00:24:01.810 --> 00:24:05.740
in understanding that you've flown
into war zones and deployed

437
00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:10.270
code and flown out? Absolutely
we That's so awesome. Do

438
00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:12.850
you just like fly in
and like go get pushed

439
00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:15.130
and then like bail? Or
how does that work? Well,

440
00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:18.880
one of the USDS modeled
value values, we call them

441
00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:20.680
our six values. One of
the U S D S

442
00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:23.470
values is simple. It's go
to where the work is.

443
00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:26.920
You know, you don't sit
in your ivory tower and

444
00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:28.930
do stuff. You go to
where the actual work is.

445
00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:33.490
And we at the DDS,
we're at the DOD, our

446
00:24:33.490 --> 00:24:37.450
users are military personnel. So
we're going to go to

447
00:24:37.450 --> 00:24:40.060
where their work is. Well,
if they're deployed overseas, we

448
00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:43.900
go overseas. And so yes,
one of the systems that

449
00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:47.260
we worked on the code
is an opensource on code

450
00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:50.440
dot Miller actually is we
went out to Cabo. We

451
00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:55.090
were out in Afghanistan and
that's where we discovered that

452
00:24:55.330 --> 00:24:57.100
when we talked to the
users and ask them what

453
00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:59.350
issues are having, you know,
told them what we did

454
00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:01.090
and how could we, how
we can help. And they

455
00:25:01.090 --> 00:25:02.940
said, you need to look
at this software called eight

456
00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:06.490
net. And Aina is the
advisor network is the software

457
00:25:06.490 --> 00:25:09.940
by which the natal forces
out there in Kabul are

458
00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:13.810
working to try to help
stand up the Afghan government

459
00:25:13.810 --> 00:25:17.140
and show them, get them
stood up and track the

460
00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:19.810
progress of how they're going.
Things like here's how you

461
00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:22.960
manage the money. Here's how
you retain your own standing

462
00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:25.450
military. Here's how you do
law enforcement. You know, the

463
00:25:25.450 --> 00:25:28.750
basic functioning of our government.
They are constantly meeting with

464
00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:31.870
Afghan counterparts in the government
to try to help them

465
00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:33.880
get stood up and keeping
track of all of these

466
00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:36.850
engagements, who they spoke to
when, how was the meeting?

467
00:25:36.850 --> 00:25:39.400
What were the topics discussed?
Things like that. They were

468
00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:41.680
keeping track of this in
a system that was quite

469
00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:44.590
frankly, not really well suited
to do so in 80,

470
00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:48.010
it was a proprietary system
that they then heavily customized

471
00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:51.490
on top of. And they
had one person onsite who

472
00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:55.030
was tasked with trying to
maintain this thing of from

473
00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:58.600
a contract. And we came
in and we understood this.

474
00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:00.100
And they said, you need
to take a look at

475
00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:02.860
this because it is causing
all kinds of problems. It

476
00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:05.320
was such a nightmare to
use and search for existing

477
00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:08.980
meetings and things and engagements.
And these are soldiers who

478
00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:12.550
rotate, you know, every like
nine months or so that

479
00:26:12.550 --> 00:26:15.520
they come in and rather
than be quickly brought up

480
00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:17.590
to speed by looking through
the prior engagements of who

481
00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:19.780
they need to deal with.
They can't find it. And

482
00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:21.940
so they could end up
having to start all over

483
00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:24.430
or turn a positive engagement
to a negative one and

484
00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:27.190
vice versa because they don't
have this information. So we

485
00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:30.610
saw an opportunity to, in
this particular case, rebuild the

486
00:26:30.610 --> 00:26:33.370
software. And we met, we
face a lot of hurdles.

487
00:26:33.370 --> 00:26:35.110
I mean, in this case,
we're dealing with NATO here

488
00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:41.290
and our lead developer who
has a strong Java background,

489
00:26:42.010 --> 00:26:44.040
wanted to do a good
chunk of the application in

490
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:46.680
Java. And I mean, I
remember sitting there and being

491
00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:49.020
towed by a person at
NATO that, you know, you

492
00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:50.970
can't do that. Java is
not even on the approved

493
00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:55.560
software list, but as like
I said earlier, we built

494
00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:57.870
it. We did it anyway.
We put a lot of

495
00:26:57.870 --> 00:27:03.660
work into it. And our
top developers built that thing

496
00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:10.440
in about 21 weeks from
scratch and got it in

497
00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:14.100
front of their face. And
we met so much resistance

498
00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:17.550
until we showed it to
them. In fact, I'm reminded

499
00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:21.000
so many times of the
Gandhi quote, you know, first

500
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.520
they ignore you. Then they
laugh at you. Then they

501
00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:27.120
fight you. Then you win.
You know, and we faced

502
00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:28.950
so much resistance until we
showed it to them and

503
00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:31.650
he saw it and we're
engaging with the users out

504
00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:34.800
in Cabo, the entire way
we're living in shipping containers,

505
00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:39.030
you know, right. With their,
with them and constantly showing

506
00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:40.860
it to them. And you
should have saw how amazed

507
00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:43.740
they were when we can
do something as magical as

508
00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:46.140
listened to what they say.
And when he say, Hey,

509
00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:48.300
it'd be nice if we
had an interface or input

510
00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:51.330
for this here, and then
we'd go and we do

511
00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:53.040
it that night and check
it in. And we meet

512
00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:55.650
with them the next day
and they see it. And

513
00:27:55.650 --> 00:27:58.470
they're like, Holy crap, you
listened to us. Wow. This

514
00:27:58.470 --> 00:28:03.750
is a new thing. And
it, it became adopted. NATO

515
00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:08.190
is now managing this system,
the same system whose cold,

516
00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:12.030
and you can see them
Kodak mill. This is revolutionary,

517
00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:15.390
but they saw it. And
yeah, we went out there.

518
00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:18.810
It was a crazy experience,
but one of the best

519
00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:21.200
of my entire life, That
is pretty. That is pretty

520
00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:23.750
awesome. How long were you
there? I was out there

521
00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:28.490
for about two weeks. Our
lead developer was out there

522
00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:30.380
for the same amount of
time, the first trip. And

523
00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:33.530
then he went back out
there for almost a month

524
00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:35.630
and he was out there
for a couple of weeks

525
00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:39.110
prior to that, we went
in like three or four

526
00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:45.230
waves of people and wrapped
up the project. And our

527
00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:47.660
PM was out there for
that last month as well.

528
00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:51.860
My particular task was having
to deal with it actually

529
00:28:51.890 --> 00:28:57.680
migrating the thousands of existing
reports of meetings from the

530
00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:00.650
old system into the new
one. This was on a

531
00:29:00.650 --> 00:29:04.580
secure facility, on a secure
network. And if you've never

532
00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:09.230
tried to interact with Java
and parse XML across soap

533
00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:12.200
interfaces, inside a secure facility
where you have no internet

534
00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:15.380
access and cannot bring in
your own electronic devices inside

535
00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:18.140
of the middle of a
war zone is an interesting

536
00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:21.470
experience. Yeah, you haven't deployed
software until you've done that

537
00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:24.860
well, and you really have
to understand this is about

538
00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:27.350
understanding the users, right? It
makes no sense unless you

539
00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:29.150
are in the environment where
the user will be using

540
00:29:29.150 --> 00:29:32.450
the software. Exactly. Otherwise, what
are you doing at all?

541
00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:33.830
You need, you need to
do it the right way

542
00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:37.490
For me. There's no better
example of engaging with the

543
00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:41.410
users in that there is
absolutely no way we could

544
00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:43.960
have any work close to
replicate it, that kind of

545
00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:48.750
user environment, except for being
there. So where do you

546
00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:50.520
think that people should do,
who are listening to this

547
00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:53.130
show who maybe didn't even
know that the digital service

548
00:29:53.130 --> 00:29:56.100
existed, that the defense digital
service existed? Where should they

549
00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:58.890
start? If this is something
that they're interested in doing,

550
00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:01.440
If a person is interested
in and lending their technical

551
00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:04.530
skills to help government, then
you should definitely go to

552
00:30:04.530 --> 00:30:10.770
usda.gov and apply for the
United States digital service. If you

553
00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:13.770
were very interested in working
specifically with the DOD and

554
00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:16.590
the, the crazy stuff that
we do here, you can

555
00:30:16.590 --> 00:30:19.650
make that known as you
apply. We are an agency

556
00:30:19.650 --> 00:30:22.920
team of the United States postal
service. There are other agency

557
00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:25.050
teams there. We have a
digital service team at the

558
00:30:25.050 --> 00:30:29.100
VA. We have one at
DHS, we have a few.

559
00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:33.570
And so we, we are
all hiring and we can

560
00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:39.180
all use technical assistance. And
this is a great way

561
00:30:39.450 --> 00:30:42.570
for people who think that
there are improvements that can

562
00:30:42.570 --> 00:30:45.750
be made in government to
help actually make that happen.

563
00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:48.480
And these agencies correct me
if I'm wrong. These are

564
00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:51.900
nonpartisan agencies. These are government
agencies that are important, and

565
00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:55.230
the work continues both before
and after, you know, presidents

566
00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:58.710
and senators and representatives come
and go, Absolutely. We're not

567
00:30:58.710 --> 00:31:02.520
doing this work to make
presidents or senators or anyone

568
00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:06.150
look good. We're doing this
work because we are American

569
00:31:06.150 --> 00:31:08.790
citizens, just like the people
that the government serves. And

570
00:31:08.790 --> 00:31:10.680
we want to try to
make this better for citizens.

571
00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:13.620
The work that has been
at the VA for example,

572
00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:16.890
is work that directly helps
veterans and their family members.

573
00:31:17.130 --> 00:31:19.290
The work we're doing at
the DOD with DDS is

574
00:31:19.290 --> 00:31:23.460
directly helping servicemen and their
family members. We did work

575
00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:25.740
last year at the state
department that was directly helping

576
00:31:25.890 --> 00:31:30.450
refugees. We are doing this
because those types of problems

577
00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:34.410
persist and need to be
resolved regardless of which party

578
00:31:34.410 --> 00:31:36.810
is in office. And so,
you know, lead the party

579
00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:38.910
leadership at the door to
come and help the people.

580
00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:41.790
Very cool. Well, thank you
so much for chatting with

581
00:31:41.790 --> 00:31:43.740
me today and thank you
for your service and to

582
00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:46.500
our service members out there
running your software. We appreciate

583
00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:48.510
them as well. Thank you
very much. And I really

584
00:31:48.510 --> 00:31:51.780
appreciate you being honest. This
has been another episode of

585
00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:54.270
Hanselminutes and we'll see you
again next week.
