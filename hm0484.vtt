8
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.340
a weekly discussion with web
developer and technologist Scott Hanselman.

9
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.870
This is Lawrence Ryan announcing show
number four 88. In this

10
00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.250
episode, Scott talks with emoji
Miller about redesigning computer science

11
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:09.870
education. Hi, this is Scott
Hanselman. This is another episode

12
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.690
of Hansel minutes. And today
I'm talking with emoji Miller.

13
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.780
She is the lead researcher
on the hip hop project

14
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.480
at UC Berkeley. She's got
a degree in computer science,

15
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.960
a master's in electrical engineering,
and is currently deep, deep

16
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.650
into working on a doctorate
on a computer science education.

17
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.700
You have you, are you
a PhD yet? No, I

18
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.250
am not. In a couple
of weeks will be dr.

19
00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.680
Miller. That is very exciting.
How are you going to

20
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.630
insist everyone? Call your doctor?
I think that if you

21
00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.700
spend that much time in
school, though, it's your right

22
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.410
now, Want me to write
some books and make money

23
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.170
beyond that? I just wanted
to have the knowledge for

24
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.890
my own desires. And what
is your thesis on? What

25
00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.380
have you, what is the
knowledge you've collected? So what

26
00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.130
I've been working on is
the social curricular activities that

27
00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.840
impact women and underrepresented minorities
at a research one university

28
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.560
like Berkeley. We wanted to
figure out if we could

29
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.970
do things to help boost
the representation of certain groups

30
00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.630
at the collegiate level, so
that we're running experiments. If

31
00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.920
we design a new course
from scratch, focusing on computational

32
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.520
thinking, would that attract more
women? Will that attract more

33
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.760
ethnic minorities? So it's a
lot of work in introductory

34
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.450
computer science. And when I
first started this whole line

35
00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.500
of inquiry, I did not
know that this becomes something

36
00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.160
very, very interesting. I thought,
Oh, it's intro computer science.

37
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.990
I just want to know
what's going on in this

38
00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.400
kind of space. I've now
come to realize that creating

39
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:49.610
the entryway for people is
of paramount importance because without

40
00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.490
a good entryway, they'll never
be able to ramp up

41
00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.650
in our field. So does
is the postulate that existing

42
00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.090
intro to computer science courses
are framed in such a

43
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.550
way that they aren't attractive
to all kinds of people?

44
00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.100
Absolutely. The case, yes. They're
not attractive to most kinds

45
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.830
of people. This is not
necessarily just about women or

46
00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.220
ethnic minorities. This is about
men too, the way we've

47
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.910
done computer science right now,
it only works for a

48
00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.350
small subset of the population.
Even if you look at

49
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.730
just men, white and Asian
males, we still tend to

50
00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.780
skew towards a certain kind
of personality. We don't have

51
00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.650
a diversity of personalities even
within those groups and is

52
00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.510
because of the way that
we teach things. We teach

53
00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.170
things in a very abstract
December bloodied way, and we

54
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.830
don't teach things to solve
problems that real people have.

55
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.850
We just teach you like
almost discrete math, completely devoid

56
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.030
of fleshing, the whole thing
out, and actually solving a

57
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.250
tangible problem for an organization.
That's interesting. The there's always

58
00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.840
that personality type or that,
that stereotype of the, of

59
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.560
the nerd that's focused on
the tiny technical details. We

60
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.130
always joke about, you know,
dungeon, Dungeons and dragons, right?

61
00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.370
But that is the personality
type that is, you know,

62
00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.370
typically at a very good
programmer because they're so detail

63
00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.340
oriented. They remember all the
tiny little business rules and

64
00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.130
how they interact and that
allows them to see how

65
00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.540
a system works. It is
in fact, the case that,

66
00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.930
yes, that kind of personality
does well programming, computer science,

67
00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.230
but as a fallacy, that's
not the only personality that

68
00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:35.700
does well with programming. Everybody
has a level of slight

69
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.490
obsession if you want to
call it that. Yeah. It

70
00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.320
depends on what they're obsessed
about, but you're absolutely right.

71
00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.740
Exactly. It depends on if
you're interest for some people

72
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.510
they're interested in solving a
particular problem for a specific

73
00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:52.290
reason. And given the problem,
they'll figure out everything. They

74
00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.170
need to know some other
people, actually, not that interested

75
00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.470
in solving a particular problem,
they're more interested in intellectual

76
00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:03.240
brain teases. They're interested in
something because it is hard

77
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.370
and they want to figure
out the want to make

78
00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.160
it simple. It doesn't have
to matter if it's solving

79
00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.960
anything for anybody. So those
kinds of personalities is what

80
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.230
we have right now. People
who are like I'm obsessive

81
00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:20.670
puzzle solver. Yes. I think
that's absolutely true that that's,

82
00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.740
that's who I have been
working with for the last

83
00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.740
20 years. And that person
has a specific role to

84
00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.940
play, but as technology's becoming
more and more ubiquitous, and

85
00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.880
the end products of technology
are beginning to interact more

86
00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.820
and more with people who
are not technologically savvy. It

87
00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.490
is imperative that you have
the other kinds of people

88
00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.190
in the field, because what
ends up happening is you

89
00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:44.430
build a product and it
has very low adoption because

90
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.680
you've solved the problem that
nobody even recognized as a

91
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.570
problem. And you haven't solved
a problem that people are

92
00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:52.200
interested in. So it becomes,
you know, you write all

93
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.110
this apps and they just
clog the app store and

94
00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:59.660
they go nowhere. So Is
that that's comes at it

95
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.600
from the kind of a
top down perspective where apps

96
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.840
are not designed for all
different kinds of people. So

97
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.840
they're not going to, you
know, achieve ubiquity and achieve

98
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.540
success. But from the bottom
up thinking about from like

99
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.020
the metal up, is there
something that we do in

100
00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.490
either education or programming, language
design or UI design to

101
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:23.900
make computers more attractive to
everyone, specifically the making of

102
00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.180
stuff and the writing of
stuff, as opposed to the,

103
00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:32.560
the, the consumption? Yeah, Absolutely.
It's the case. The first

104
00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.740
number one challenge is the
way you teach a programming

105
00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:40.360
language. So for example, if
the very first taste you

106
00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:47.200
have is fighting syntax for
a lot of people, frightened

107
00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:52.570
syntax does not give them
a sense of achievement. They

108
00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:54.790
want to solve a problem.
Maybe they want to build

109
00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:58.870
their own version of Pac-Man
and they want instant gratification.

110
00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.790
They were willing to spend
an hour or two hours

111
00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:02.800
fiddling about with this thing.
And then this is something

112
00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:07.090
that works. If that two
hours is literally spent building

113
00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:11.890
a dev environment, which is
the case, oftentimes depending on

114
00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:14.830
what kind of programming language
you're starting off with, you're

115
00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:17.440
just like, I spent two
hours building this dev environment

116
00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.410
and I have nothing to
show for it. Right? If

117
00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:24.280
you start them off on
something, very, very simple, but

118
00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:28.600
teaches the fundamentals of competitional
thinking something like scratch, which

119
00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:31.120
is not too incomplete, even
though a lot of people

120
00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.340
give it like, Oh, it's
for kids, but it's one

121
00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:36.430
of those things that lets
you have preciate computation just

122
00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:40.390
for computation sake and still
gives you that visual feedback

123
00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:44.740
very, very quickly. So you
do something 30 minutes, there's

124
00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:47.650
something up there and you
can actually like send that

125
00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:50.020
little app to a friend
and that friend can play

126
00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:52.810
something on that app. You
feel a sense of accomplishment.

127
00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.630
All of a sudden you're
like, Oh my God, somebody

128
00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:58.000
is using something that I
wrote, even though it might

129
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.870
not be earth shattering. Once
you can click that, Oh

130
00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:05.050
my God, it's easier to
move that person to Python

131
00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:09.100
or to Java and becoming
much more complex problem solvers.

132
00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:13.390
Yeah. Yesterday at, at Oz
con at the open source

133
00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:15.790
conference, I took my seven
year old and my nine

134
00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:20.710
year old. And we went
to a unity demonstration and

135
00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:24.310
class that was done by
Stacy Mulcahy. And she showed

136
00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:29.200
the boys how to make
a flappy bird and the

137
00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.600
part, and I'm not familiar
with unity. I, you know,

138
00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:33.520
I knew that it exists
and what it does, but

139
00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.230
what blew me away was
that they, they put their

140
00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:38.170
Sprite on the screen and
then they gave it a

141
00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:42.730
rigid body, two dimensional physics
attribute, and they hit play

142
00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.880
and it dropped like a
stone. And in my mind,

143
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.610
the distance that was going
to be required from, you

144
00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:50.290
know, putting a Sprite on
the screen and getting it

145
00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:52.360
to behave like it had
gravity was going to be

146
00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:55.030
quite a bit farther than
that. We, we built up

147
00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:58.820
almost full game in about
two hours. Yeah. I mean,

148
00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:01.940
this is it's possible. And
I think we, that learned

149
00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:05.060
the old school way, feel
like, Oh no, no, no.

150
00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.670
It's going to take that's
three weeks worth of work

151
00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:11.480
to get to that point.
No, I, my, my nine

152
00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:14.300
year old I went to
his class. He goes to

153
00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:17.300
a school that was very
project focused and they will

154
00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:20.270
have coding. This kids have
code in, in their class.

155
00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:22.610
And they've been working on
a project for three months

156
00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:24.320
and there's a kind of
demo day. You go in

157
00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:27.110
there and the shell show
you what the built and

158
00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:29.150
I am just in awe.
This is at the point

159
00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:32.660
they're eight years old, floppy
birds and angry birds must

160
00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:35.480
be the thing. They build
their own version of flappy

161
00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:40.070
birds. And the simulation was
so realistic. And I was

162
00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:41.930
like, how did you guys
get that? And they looked

163
00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:46.190
at me like I was
broken and the set of

164
00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:51.350
physics engine, duh, I was
just like, wow. So physics

165
00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:53.570
engine who knew there was
just like, yeah, you'd get

166
00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:55.790
your physics engine into it
so that your simulations are

167
00:09:55.790 --> 00:10:00.560
realistic. These are kids who
now have a deep sense

168
00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:04.370
of what it is to
create something. These are nine

169
00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:06.830
year old, eight year olds
talking about a physics engine

170
00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:10.400
for realistic simulation. So they're
focusing their energy on the

171
00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:14.270
computation. They're not fighting syntax
and they're actually building something

172
00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:17.150
that you will play and
you will spend hours playing.

173
00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:21.890
Right. And it seems like
we, the, you know, the

174
00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:26.150
leaders of the designers, the
old people are still maybe

175
00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:28.340
in the old world, not
thinking about these new things.

176
00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:32.300
Cause right now we have
ubiquitous network. Yup. We have

177
00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:35.960
a very nice clean layer
of abstraction with HTTP. We

178
00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:38.750
can get resources very easily.
You know, we don't worry

179
00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:41.870
about zip file formats anymore.
You know, the, the, the

180
00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:44.570
thing I remember the like
during, when I was coming

181
00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:46.940
up, we still hadn't decided
how to squish data, how

182
00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:50.420
to compress data. You know,
so many problems have been,

183
00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:54.620
have been solved. And we're
exactly, even that's a great

184
00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:56.510
way to put it. Not
just solved, eliminated. They are

185
00:10:56.510 --> 00:11:01.820
non-issues thereby, but computer science
one-on-one is the same class

186
00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:04.670
it's been for the last
40 years. Exactly. You want

187
00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:09.440
to teach people about data
structures, which is fabulous. Everybody

188
00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:12.860
needs to know data structures,
but the way we teach,

189
00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:14.960
it's almost like we're teaching.
We forget that we are

190
00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:20.540
human beings. The best teacher
is a sales person. I

191
00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:23.930
have this fundamental idea that
you cannot teach anybody. Anything.

192
00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:28.430
What you can do is
guided facilitation. They have to

193
00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:31.760
decide, they want to learn
it. Once you turn on

194
00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:35.120
the light, they will go
and get the knowledge that

195
00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.610
they need for themselves. And
you will be the human

196
00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:41.930
that can help them figure
out the bottlenecks faster because

197
00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:44.510
the world is so different.
Now, everything you literally need

198
00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:48.380
to know is available to
you somewhere online. So the

199
00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:51.200
idea that I, the teacher
I'm the expert is no

200
00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:55.360
longer the case. I a
certain skill that I can

201
00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:58.690
support you in your learning,
but I am no means

202
00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:01.600
the expert. You might end
up being the expert for

203
00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:06.040
that area. I just need
to unravel the little layers

204
00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:07.870
that's holding you back and
get you on your way.

205
00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:12.990
Wow. That just really blew
my mind because I was

206
00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:17.220
an adjunct professor for awhile.
And I would, I would

207
00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:19.050
try to focus on knowing
as much as I could

208
00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:22.050
about the topic so that
I could go and, you

209
00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:25.440
know, bring the knowledge. But
you're absolutely right. I mean,

210
00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:30.150
most of those kids were
smarter than me already. I

211
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:32.370
need to be a facilitator
as much as a teacher.

212
00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:35.730
And it's not even a
good business case. Imagine being

213
00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:38.220
a CEO and you want
to solve all the problems

214
00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:41.790
by yourself. There's no point
you're going to get a

215
00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:45.090
CEO or CFO or CTO.
And you have employees and

216
00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:49.230
the solve problems in aggregation
as a team, you are

217
00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:54.090
adjust the coach. That is
that's really, that's really great

218
00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:57.360
way to put it. So
then a well structured computer

219
00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:01.590
science, one Oh one class
would be as much exploratory

220
00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:05.880
as it is absorbing a
knowledge about the past. Absolutely.

221
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.880
A well structured class says
day one. This is where

222
00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:11.690
we're going to get to
in X amount of hours.

223
00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:14.910
This is the end goal.
How we get to the

224
00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:17.880
end goal. We may, we
have a, we have a

225
00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:21.060
plan, but we might deviate
from the plan, but know

226
00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:23.520
that this is the end
goal. And we're going to

227
00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:28.440
co-create our path there together.
But how much history should

228
00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:30.330
there be though? One of
the things that I have

229
00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:34.300
appreciated with the T being
able to look back and

230
00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:36.750
say I was there and
this was happening when I

231
00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:38.670
was coming up and you
know, things like AOL and

232
00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:41.220
dial up, you know, you
get a little bit of

233
00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:43.440
a, like, get off my
lawn kind of an attitude.

234
00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:46.530
But at the same time
you get the perspective of

235
00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:50.700
history. Yes. And I want
young people to appreciate that.

236
00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:52.470
I don't necessarily want them
to suffer. Like they don't

237
00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:55.770
need to use assembly. No,
no, but they should know

238
00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:59.130
that the metal exists and
that the machine code exists

239
00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:00.960
at some point that there
should be a history of

240
00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:03.450
computers. Maybe it just shouldn't
be in CS one Oh

241
00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:07.440
one. No, it should be
there. I literally, I read

242
00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:13.050
the statement somewhere that it
is injecting education into culture

243
00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:16.140
and not the other way
around. And I'm an avid

244
00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:19.920
fan of history. You need
to know the foundations. You

245
00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:21.930
need to understand what it
is that you're standing on.

246
00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:26.250
Otherwise, what you build is
not going to be successful.

247
00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:29.910
Cause right now you can
bring somebody into an environment,

248
00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:32.970
teach them some frameworks and
some Java script. And in

249
00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:35.340
12 weeks that person will
say, I'm a junior developer.

250
00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:41.190
And have they built something?
Yes they have. Are they

251
00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:45.690
really a software engineer? That's
pretty much stretching the word

252
00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:49.800
as far as it can
go because you scratch the

253
00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:52.790
surface just a little bit
and ask this person a

254
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:59.180
simple question around lists, comprehension
in Python, and the whole

255
00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:02.720
thing falls apart. All you
ask them a question of

256
00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:06.620
why should I use the
link list, a doubly linked

257
00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:09.590
list versus a single eloquent
list. And then you're done.

258
00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:14.690
That's it. There's just like
a glare. There's no depth

259
00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:21.760
there. So that's dangerous. This
episode of Hansel minutes is

260
00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:24.520
brought to you by audible.
This is especially meaningful to

261
00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:26.410
me as I have been
an audible fan. Since the

262
00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:30.310
very beginning, I've listened to
probably a hundred audio books

263
00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:33.940
on a commute between Portland
and Seattle. My favorite feature

264
00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:36.820
is whisper sync for voice.
And that means that I

265
00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:39.700
can start reading on my
Kindle. Then listen to the

266
00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:42.640
audio audible book and pick
up exactly where I left

267
00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:46.120
off. My place is always
synced between the two books.

268
00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:50.860
They've set up a special
deal for you at audible.com/hansel

269
00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:53.020
minutes. And I think that
you should take that deal

270
00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:56.110
and you should get a
book like ready player one

271
00:15:56.440 --> 00:16:00.180
or the Martian. There's some
amazing books by David Sedaris,

272
00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:05.590
Neil Stevenson, all of our
favorite authors are available@audible.com. And

273
00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:08.290
if you already own the
Kindle book, you get discounts.

274
00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:11.200
Even then, it's just a
fantastic service. And now that

275
00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:13.600
it is a part of
the Amazon family, it's even

276
00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:19.720
better. Again, that's audible.com/hansel minutes.
You're already listening to this

277
00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:25.080
podcast. Why don't you try
listening to audio books? Wouldn't

278
00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:28.480
they argue that that you're
being a little exclusionary and

279
00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:31.060
that those things aren't needed
anymore, but that, you know,

280
00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:34.960
that being a Drupal developer
is still a developer. As

281
00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:38.050
an example, There's a developer,
but it's not the same

282
00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:40.000
kinds of things. This is
the way the best way

283
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.260
I can explain it is
this. I like to eat.

284
00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:47.650
I'm a foodie. And I
live in this glorious place

285
00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:51.370
called Berkeley where we can
get like Michelin level cuisine.

286
00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:56.080
So if the goal is
to situate my hunger, I

287
00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:58.000
can go to shape her
niece, which is one of

288
00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.850
the top 50 restaurants in
the world and have this

289
00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:05.290
fabulous culinary experience. It was
still set yet. My hunger.

290
00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:07.960
On the other hand, I
could just go to my

291
00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:11.710
local taco truck and eat
something. And my hunger is

292
00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:18.160
situated. Those are two separate
experiences. They solve the same

293
00:17:18.370 --> 00:17:22.990
problem, but the solvent and
very, very interesting ways. If

294
00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:25.540
you are a Drupal developer
and that is all, you

295
00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:28.330
know, you're going to get
very far, but you're not

296
00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:30.910
going to get as far
as you could possibly go.

297
00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:34.510
You start off on your
way and you're right there.

298
00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:37.870
But if what you want
is to actually architect something

299
00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:41.890
from scratch or invent something
amazing, or have a very

300
00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:45.760
high level of sophistication about
your craft, you're gonna need

301
00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:49.680
to know about the bones
of it. Software engineering, a

302
00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:55.410
high level, vocational craft. It
is a craft, but the

303
00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:59.910
craft rest on the, on
the layer of computer science,

304
00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:02.610
but it is a craft.
So you need both of

305
00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:05.520
them. You need some parts
of the computer science and

306
00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:08.580
they need to transition from
a beginner to a master

307
00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:13.280
developer. You know that those,
this, this, I love that

308
00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:17.300
you said craft this concept
of like craftsman ship and,

309
00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:21.950
and the, the idea of
the apprentice it's been lost.

310
00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:24.080
There's so many people, like
you said, they go to

311
00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:26.840
a code camp and they
come out of junior developer

312
00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:29.330
or they, you know, they
w it's like, how do

313
00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:34.040
we balance the, the quality
and the craft and trying

314
00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:38.150
to create high quality thinkers
who can go and be

315
00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:41.060
software engineers in the real
world. And at the same

316
00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:44.440
time, we want to make
it, you know, easy and

317
00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:46.850
make the onboarding experience for
young people. Easy. Like you

318
00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:49.340
don't want to say, all
right, get started. It's easy.

319
00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:51.860
Look, you can make fluffy
burden an hour. Now work

320
00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:54.770
for 15 years and maybe
you'll get senior engineer. You

321
00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:57.500
know, there's a balance. There's
a balance. There's a there's.

322
00:18:57.770 --> 00:19:02.870
So maybe not 15 years,
but maybe a year. Like

323
00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:06.860
there are no shortcuts to
greatness. There's just not a,

324
00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:10.340
and the hours you need
to practice, you truly need

325
00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:14.150
to practice. We say over
here that for you to

326
00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:17.300
get to a certain level
of proficiency in anything, especially

327
00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:21.740
something technical, you need 15
hours a week for 50

328
00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:26.480
weeks Is that 10,000 hours
is that the, the Gladwell

329
00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:28.910
number, It's not necessarily 10,000
hours. There aren't like 400

330
00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:32.120
and something hours for it
to really, really get good

331
00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:36.800
at something. This technical true.
You need that time. Now,

332
00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:39.560
how you get to that
time is up to you.

333
00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:43.130
It could take you 15
years to get to that

334
00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:48.050
level of time working on
a certain data structure. Or

335
00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:50.360
you could take you six
months if that's all you

336
00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:53.660
did. But how you get
to the time is up

337
00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:57.980
to you. Get into that
time is completely in escapable.

338
00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:01.340
You got to get to
practice and be that good

339
00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:04.640
at it. You cannot, if
three months is not enough

340
00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:07.430
time of practice. Right? But
isn't that, that's the, that's

341
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:10.460
the funny dichotomy of all
of this is that you

342
00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:13.310
want to get them excited
in an hour. Yes. But

343
00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:14.540
you don't want them to
think at the end of

344
00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:17.600
that hour that they're done
and they know computers. Exactly.

345
00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:19.460
You don't want somebody to
go to a hackathon and

346
00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:22.580
say, now hire me as
a junior developer, right? You

347
00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:26.180
want to let them know
this is an onboarding on

348
00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:30.170
a journey. And what we
will achieve in an hour

349
00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:33.620
is basically we've opened the
door, but the journey has

350
00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:36.380
not started. You are Dorothy
on the yellow brick road.

351
00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:40.520
We're not at all as
yet. So how are you

352
00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:43.970
structuring these classes? I I've
taught computer science one Oh

353
00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:46.460
one. I know how it
was done in the late

354
00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:52.440
nineties. How should it be
done tomorrow? Tomorrow? The way

355
00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:54.390
that I would do it,
if I was doing computer

356
00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:57.600
science, one Oh one tomorrow
is basically tell you, this

357
00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:59.070
is what we're trying to
get at at the end

358
00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:02.580
of whatever it is, three
months, four months, and then

359
00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:06.750
treat my students as adults.
I will literally still start

360
00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:10.440
them off in a drag
and drop graphical environment like

361
00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:13.320
scratch or unity or anything
like that, so that they

362
00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:16.530
can understand you can easily
build something and get those

363
00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:20.010
juices flowing. Then I will
then dial it back down

364
00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:22.200
and say, now that we've
seen how it can build

365
00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:24.990
flappy birds, now we're going
to go and learn the

366
00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:34.350
fundamentals and then situated in
terms of society. And that

367
00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:37.260
last bit of situating it
in terms of society is

368
00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:41.010
what I often don't see
happening at all. You're just

369
00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:46.260
solving problems in a December
disengaged way. So that's an

370
00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:49.860
issue that's really interesting because
I've, I've done the let's

371
00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:52.350
make a game and now
let's look at how a

372
00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:56.730
circle gets drawn. Yeah. But
how A circuit gets drawn

373
00:21:56.820 --> 00:22:00.000
is super interesting to me,
but I've tried to teach

374
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.840
my, my wife who has
more degrees than I, and

375
00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:07.500
speaks more languages than I,
but has a focused disinterest

376
00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:11.670
in computer science and how,
you know, how interesting it

377
00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:13.650
is to draw a circle
and the math behind it.

378
00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:16.620
She doesn't care. It's even
more of a turn off.

379
00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:19.680
Like if she could get
even more disinterested in computers,

380
00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:21.660
it would be, let's do
a class on how to

381
00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:24.720
draw a circle. But is
that, is it that kind

382
00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:27.180
of thinking that is getting
us certain kinds of people

383
00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:30.960
in software? It is absolutely
that. So instead of let's

384
00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:33.320
get, we're going to draw
a circle after we drove

385
00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:37.440
the circle that was actually
talking about gaming. Do we

386
00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.720
like what we're seeing in
gaming right now? What is

387
00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:41.880
the video game that you've
played that you really absolutely

388
00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:45.570
love? How did that video
game make you feel? And

389
00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:48.600
you talk about the psychology
of building games and gimmicks

390
00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:51.000
vacation, and how you can
continue on a quest and

391
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.310
a video game forever and
never, and you're never give

392
00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:55.590
up. And you bring that
in and said, this is

393
00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:59.640
how education is supposed to
be and create an environment

394
00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:01.470
where it's easy for you
to feel when you're trying

395
00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:02.880
to play a video game
or you're trying to get

396
00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:05.100
to the next level. Nobody
believes that they're going to

397
00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:07.740
reach the summit of the
levels of the video gaming,

398
00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:11.610
their first try. That's why
it's addictive. You just want

399
00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:13.710
to keep on trying so
they can get as far

400
00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:16.200
as you can. And you
talk about all the mechanics

401
00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:19.500
of that. People are going
to be engaged. And then

402
00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:21.270
you're going to go all
the way back and say,

403
00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:24.900
now for us to build
all this, we need to

404
00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:28.770
understand how to draw circles
and polygons and rectangles and

405
00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:31.860
all this kind of other
stuff. Then they're like, Oh,

406
00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:35.700
okay, I see why we
are doing this. Now That

407
00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:37.710
really works. That makes a
lot of sense. I mean,

408
00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:40.530
this is where we want
to go. And this circle

409
00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:43.650
drawing bit stands in our
way. Let's just get that

410
00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:45.950
out of the way. We'll
do that. But they need

411
00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:48.320
to see what, what the
goal is. Because if you

412
00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:51.080
go and try to teach
someone that the circle is

413
00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:54.710
the goal, no, you're going
to get a very specific

414
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:56.890
kind of personality. Exactly. And
most of people are going

415
00:23:56.890 --> 00:23:59.320
to be like, I don't
care about the math behind

416
00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:01.600
this, no matter how interesting
that math is, they're like,

417
00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:04.390
I don't care. How is
this solving my problem? It's

418
00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:07.150
not solving their problem. I
don't care. I don't want

419
00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:11.380
to do this again. This
is so funny because I

420
00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:16.300
wrote an application in 1993
or 94 for the Palm

421
00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:19.750
pilot, Palm little black and
white pump. Okay. So the

422
00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:23.260
Palm pilot did not have
a math library. Okay. It

423
00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:25.900
had no sign. It had
no co-sign it also didn't

424
00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:29.800
have floating point. Oh yeah.
So I took an integer

425
00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:32.200
and cut it in half
and said, all right, these

426
00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:34.540
top bits are on the
left of the decimal. And

427
00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:36.160
these bottom bits are on
the right of the decimal.

428
00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:40.960
And I basically wrote a
holes, math library on a

429
00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:44.530
non floating point to draw
a circle. And I ran

430
00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:47.680
and I showed my then
girlfriend, look at what I

431
00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:51.250
just did. I drew a
circle on this, you know,

432
00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:59.320
pilot. And just th the
disinterest was palpable. Cause she

433
00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:04.660
was like, I am, I
should be excited because just

434
00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:07.540
doesn't get it. Doesn't get
all the work you did.

435
00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:12.970
Like, I literally like invented
scientific potent point method that

436
00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:15.820
didn't exist. I build this
whole layer of obstruction. Yeah.

437
00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:17.440
Yeah. So by the time
I had done the flood,

438
00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:20.830
Phil, you know, I think
we'd broken up. Yeah. It's

439
00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:25.690
those things like, why, why
should I care? What literally

440
00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:28.570
it's always, why should I
care? It might seem so

441
00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:34.360
like mystical and narcissistic, but
if you're teaching people, that's

442
00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:35.650
the first thing they want
to know. Why should I

443
00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:38.980
care? Why should I? So
here's the thing. The application

444
00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:43.330
I wrote was a diabetes
blood sugar management system, you

445
00:25:43.330 --> 00:25:48.100
know, 20 plus years ahead
of its time that that

446
00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:52.180
particular person disinterested in circle
drawing could have been potentially

447
00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:54.940
a really great business manager
or project manager or UI

448
00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:57.370
designer. If I had only
come at it from that

449
00:25:57.370 --> 00:26:00.880
direction. Exactly. And that is
the task that we, as

450
00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:04.960
the computer science educator community
has to solve. And not

451
00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:09.400
just for students who are
like 10 years old or

452
00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:13.720
12 years old for post-college
Really? Oh yeah. You don't

453
00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:16.450
just give up on the
old people. Oh, absolutely not.

454
00:26:16.690 --> 00:26:19.030
That's my sweet spot. That's
what I love working with.

455
00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:20.770
Because you know, when you're
working with a 10 year

456
00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:22.900
old kid, I mean, it's
satisfying. The kid is doing

457
00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:25.840
this. It's learning that. And
maybe in five years or

458
00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:30.130
16 years or six years,
it'll come to fruition and

459
00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:34.060
adult, like this is like
major now an adult, right.

460
00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:38.650
Knows nothing. And then a
year from now, that person

461
00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:44.730
is a bonafide premium software
engineer. And they're adding value

462
00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:49.440
to society in 12 months.
That is amazing. Not only

463
00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:51.390
is it amazing from the
fact that they actually add

464
00:26:51.390 --> 00:26:56.010
in value, they are getting
a livable wage. That is

465
00:26:56.010 --> 00:27:00.690
kind of pretty awesome. So
you can move people from

466
00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:05.760
poverty into the middle class
in less than 12 months.

467
00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:10.640
And it's all legal. You're
not doing anything. It is

468
00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:13.610
all legal. You should, you
should get a tee shirt

469
00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:15.980
that says, ask me about
software engineering. And like, it's

470
00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:20.030
all legal. And that's a
really great hashtag Selling crack.

471
00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:24.380
But the crack though is
selling his addiction to problem

472
00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:27.740
solving. Yeah. It's open source.
It's free. It's open source

473
00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:29.540
free and you get paid
for it. How, how could

474
00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:32.510
anyone not want this job?
Exactly? How could anyone not

475
00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:34.820
want this job? And then
it's like, you can change

476
00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:37.370
your life. You could work
from home. Every kind of

477
00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:39.830
personality is needed. If you
never want to talk to

478
00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:42.590
a human being, there's a
place for you. If you're

479
00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:45.290
like talking to human beings
all the time, guess what?

480
00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:49.340
You'll be a great product
manager. And there's something for

481
00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:53.120
everybody. If you're an artist,
UI UX, if you, all

482
00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:54.680
you want to do is
just tell stories all day

483
00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:57.380
long. There's a place for
you in writing narratives for

484
00:27:57.380 --> 00:28:00.560
video games or movies, any
kind of personality at this

485
00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:05.750
point has a space in
computer science. It seems like

486
00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:09.890
we've got to convince people
that who are maybe set

487
00:28:09.890 --> 00:28:14.090
in their way, that lots
of different kinds of what

488
00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:17.330
I call it. Diversity in
thinking is absolutely required on,

489
00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:21.290
on good teams. Oh, absolutely.
Especially if you're trying to

490
00:28:21.290 --> 00:28:24.740
solve some very hard problems
or like right now here

491
00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:29.990
at Berkeley, we actually created
a development engineering minor that

492
00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:35.000
is interdisciplinary because we've actually
sent your research. If you

493
00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:38.540
create solutions to problems that
people are interested in and

494
00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:41.180
the people guide the problems
they get to pick, you

495
00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:44.150
actually build a more diverse
team. And you actually also

496
00:28:44.150 --> 00:28:50.690
attract diversity in that group
and you solve better problems

497
00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:55.340
and problems that the solutions
have high adoption rates. Because

498
00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:58.250
often times you might, there's
nothing more frustrating than having

499
00:28:58.250 --> 00:29:02.990
the solution to a problem.
And nobody cares and it's

500
00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:05.540
not adopted and it doesn't
actually make it to market.

501
00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:08.000
It's just sitting on a
shelf or it's sitting in

502
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.400
some archive or it's sitting
in get hub, like nothing

503
00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:13.970
is coming from it. That's
like the last mile problem

504
00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:20.420
actually adding value to society.
The, the, the thing that

505
00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:23.030
I try to use when
I'm talking to people of

506
00:29:23.030 --> 00:29:27.560
all, any age about computers
is the idea that this

507
00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:31.310
represents power. Oh, here it
is. You know, if you

508
00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:35.000
don't feel, if you feel
disempowered, you know, get, get

509
00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.760
even a little bit of
technical understanding about what's going

510
00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:42.190
on and you start making
your way up. The a

511
00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:46.230
very, very, Absolutely, absolutely for
very quickly. And for people

512
00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:49.530
who feel disempowered, especially, I
mean, women are the largest,

513
00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:56.010
the most marginalized majority. They
could have power people of

514
00:29:56.010 --> 00:29:59.160
color who have been disproportionately
weirded out. They could have

515
00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:02.220
power. And that's where data
science actually is interesting and

516
00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:06.930
statistics and data mining, because
those are the parts of

517
00:30:06.930 --> 00:30:11.070
computation now that are very
much driven by what the

518
00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:16.380
human is interested in finding
out. So the kinds of

519
00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:19.170
experiments that get run on
data are the kinds of

520
00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:23.340
experiments that the human decides
they want to run. And

521
00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:25.770
because of the kinds of
questions you ask, you will

522
00:30:25.770 --> 00:30:29.160
find a different set of
answers. And I think that's

523
00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:33.360
where diversity really, really comes
to play and becomes even

524
00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:38.670
critical, even way more critical
in getting great insight into

525
00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:42.630
large data sets. Yeah. I
think that people take the

526
00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:46.290
word diversity, which is simply
a word, you know, that,

527
00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:48.990
you know, it means literally
what it means. And they

528
00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:51.780
start applying a lot more
to it than maybe is

529
00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:54.720
necessary. And they also start
thinking, well, this is about

530
00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:57.630
gender. This is about color.
This is about, you know,

531
00:30:57.780 --> 00:31:01.290
it is. And it isn't,
it's more than that. Right?

532
00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:08.280
But it's that homogenous groups
don't succeed. No, no, they,

533
00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:12.690
they, they, they, they, they
die off. Absolutely. It's just,

534
00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:15.210
it's just what it is.
And this one, you don't

535
00:31:15.210 --> 00:31:17.910
even have to be a
Christian to appreciate this, the

536
00:31:17.910 --> 00:31:21.900
stories of the gospel and
the Bible they're telling everybody

537
00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:24.210
is saying the same thing
about an event that witnessed

538
00:31:24.390 --> 00:31:26.820
over a couple of years,
but they're telling it from

539
00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:30.990
very different perspectives. And that
is a diverse take on

540
00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:34.320
what happened. So maybe Mark
tells it from his perspective.

541
00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:36.870
Luke tells it from his
perspective, the other one tells

542
00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:39.360
it from his perspective and
somewhere along the line, if

543
00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:41.280
they all tell him the
same story, at some point,

544
00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:44.220
there should be some unity
and that's what happened, but

545
00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:48.510
you don't lose any different
having the diverse perspectives. Very

546
00:31:48.510 --> 00:31:51.330
true. Very true. Well, thank
you so much for chatting

547
00:31:51.330 --> 00:31:53.910
with me. Thank you so
much, Scott, for inviting me.

548
00:31:53.910 --> 00:31:56.580
This was fun. Hopefully by
the time people listen to

549
00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:58.710
this, you will not just
be soon to be dr.

550
00:31:58.710 --> 00:32:01.260
Miller, but you will be
actually dr. Meltzer. I wish

551
00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:04.710
you all the best. Thank
you so much. This has

552
00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:07.200
been another episode of Hanselminutes
and we'll see you again

553
00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:07.770
next week.
