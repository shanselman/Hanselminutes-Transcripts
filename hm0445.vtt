00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.230
minutes, a weekly discussion with
web developer and technologist Scott

this episode, Scott talks with
podcaster radio host and advocate,

11
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:06.920
Elon James White, about the new
digital journalism. Hi, this is

12
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.930
Scott Hanselman. This is another
episode of Hansel minutes, and

13
00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.480
I've got on Skype here.
Ilan James White. How are you,

14
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.210
sir? I'm alive and kicking,
sir. Yes, you are alive

15
00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.090
and kicking and you are
becoming a media powerhouse. I

16
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.720
knew you from your podcast
this week in blackness, which

17
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.110
is now twig, a kind
of a multimedia powerhouse. You've

18
00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.450
got radio, you've got magazines.
You're on TV. I'm seeing

19
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.820
you all over indeed. Twitter.
It's been a very interesting

20
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.390
ride altogether because in all
honesty, the podcast wasn't even

21
00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.460
the first thing. What we
did, what we did initially,

22
00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.540
was a web series on
YouTube that got picked up

23
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.530
weirdly in the 2008 election
cycle. It got picked up

24
00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.660
by academia and the whole,
the progressive blogosphere. And then

25
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.150
at that point we went
from that and then people

26
00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.250
started picking it up. We
started, I started being asked

27
00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.590
to speak across the country
at universities and stuff like

28
00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.280
that. And then in front
enough to get out of

29
00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.910
having to actively vote a
video edit constantly, which is

30
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.760
what I was doing. I
started, I did, I started

31
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.160
a podcast, which I had,
I had played with podcasts

32
00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.710
a few times, but I
finally really committed to the

33
00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.780
podcast situation and in 11
2011, because it actually was

34
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.270
requested from the audience. We
did a podcast for two

35
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.180
weeks and I think, Oh
nine and people were talking

36
00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.040
about it for over a
year saying, Oh, you gotta

37
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.320
bring that show back. And
I'm like, okay. And then

38
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.000
we did that. And so
we started a podcast and

39
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.130
then all of a sudden
from the podcast, we realized

40
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.780
that people wanted to hear
more from us. Cause we

41
00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.430
were talking about one thing,
but then we'd go on

42
00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.860
these tangents, especially cause I
I'm a big nerd. So

43
00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.930
all of a sudden we'd
be talking about some racial

44
00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.300
issue and I'd try to
make some doctor who comparison.

45
00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.240
And then people, people would
be like, let's say people

46
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.010
get it. And other half
don't look at it. Right?

47
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.050
And so funny enough enough
of the audience actually was

48
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.340
like, I really like it
when you do that. And

49
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.350
then some people like I
have no clue what's happening.

50
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.030
So I was like, why
don't we do a, a

51
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.310
nerd show? So then we
ended up doing multiple podcasts.

52
00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.320
And by the end of
the beginning of 2013, we

53
00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.160
had a suite of, of
that we were putting out

54
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.220
and people kept requesting more
from what we were doing.

55
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.370
And so we just kept
stepping up to whenever, whatever

56
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.240
was requested of us. Got
it. I can see seven

57
00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.840
different shows, everything from sports
to Twitter after dark, we

58
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.530
nerd hard is a fantastic
show. You're you're doing all

59
00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.080
sorts of things. And you're
also doing really, I think

60
00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.080
you said earlier when we
spoke whatever's necessary, that is

61
00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.040
the description of Twitch isn't
it whatever's necessary. Right? W

62
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.150
w when I came back
from Ferguson doing coverage, I

63
00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.040
was, I was having a
bit of a crisis of

64
00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.990
faith. And so I was
speaking with someone with, it's

65
00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.190
actually a young woman, who's
doing a she's, she's a

66
00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.980
professor over at, at old
dominion. And she's a, her,

67
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.630
her post doc project was
us. Basically. He was Twitter,

68
00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.030
like as an independent media
space, how it works and

69
00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.860
all that type of stuff.
And so there's this woman,

70
00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.140
who's just like an expert
on everything we've ever said

71
00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.370
or done. Like she has
a database. And like, like,

72
00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.980
like all of it written
down. She can tell us

73
00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.800
when certain references that we
use regularly. Now, the first

74
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.540
time we ever said it,
like she can do that.

75
00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.460
It's really weird. And so
I was talking to her

76
00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:03.930
and I, and I was
saying, I was having this

77
00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.240
bit of a crisis of
faith because Twitter has always

78
00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.570
has like, evolved and changed
over time. And I'm like,

79
00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.730
and then Ferguson happened. And
then we were being referred

80
00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.220
to as hard hitting journalists
and reporters. I was like,

81
00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.590
I like, that was never
what I even said. We

82
00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.800
were at. I'm not sure
how to describe us or

83
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.410
what we do, especially as
new people are coming on.

84
00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.590
And she was, she actually
said, Oh, well, I can

85
00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.900
describe it. Swim is whatever's
necessary. I'm like, what do

86
00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.360
you mean? She goes, anytime
the community has ever needed

87
00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.380
something or, or, or request
something, Squibb finds a way

88
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:35.590
to do that. So if
all of a sudden there

89
00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.760
needed to be more conversations
around sex positivity, all of

90
00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.710
a sudden Twitter after dark
was born. Cause so that

91
00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.710
you could approach that there's
comments out when, what you

92
00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.110
call it around the Zimmerman
trial. There was a lot

93
00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.210
of PR, we were, we
were, everyone was going through

94
00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.010
a lot. And so we
ended up, we were on

95
00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:51.990
hiatus cause we were about
to build a studio in

96
00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.760
the Bay. And so we
were in the Bay, in

97
00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.650
the middle of, of, of
negotiations over getting the studio

98
00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.190
and then the Zimmerman trial
verdict comes down and we

99
00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.770
ended up going on air
for six hours at a

100
00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.220
time, like six, six hour
clips, just because we didn't

101
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.920
know what else to do.
And, and then with Ferguson

102
00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.340
like, Oh, well someone asked
us to where we considering

103
00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.770
going down. We said we
would, we would go down.

104
00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.570
If we could raise the
money, the money was raised

105
00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:21.420
within 12 hours flat. And
we went down there and

106
00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.310
we'll cover it. And then
we ended up becoming the

107
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.810
counter narrative of, of this
major, like, like watershed moment

108
00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.320
within U S history, especially
around race. And we were

109
00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.410
like one of the few
spaces that were actually actively

110
00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.070
countered a counter narrative, providing
a counter narrative to what

111
00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.770
the mainstream media was saying.
So this is really interesting.

112
00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.290
I want to dig into
that. So first for the

113
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.160
people who are maybe international
people, I know that we

114
00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.510
have a lot of listeners
who aren't from the U

115
00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:47.880
S who maybe aren't familiar.
There was a shooting of

116
00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.300
a young black man named
Michael Brown, August 9th in 2014 in

117
00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.970
Ferguson, Missouri. And this is
a suburb of st. Louis.

118
00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:57.680
And depending on who you
talk to, there's disputed circumstances

119
00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.410
about this, and this has
caused protests in general unrest

120
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.230
in Ferguson and people are
going down there, they're going

121
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:05.120
down there to put their
voice and make sure their

122
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.090
voice is heard. And the
protest have continued now almost

123
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:12.130
two months after. Yeah, yeah.
I'm yeah. I think he

124
00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:15.730
was the young man was
shot August 9th, August 9th. In fact.

125
00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.550
Yes. Yeah. And yeah, it's,
it's still going. I mean,

126
00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:22.480
it's not as sexy now
as, as it was in

127
00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.970
those first couple of weeks
where everyone and their mama

128
00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:26.650
was coming down there, a
lot of press was coming

129
00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:30.310
down there. So basically make
their name within, within media,

130
00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.850
which was a problematic thing
to do. And a lot

131
00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:37.000
and a lot were criticized
for doing that. But yeah,

132
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.880
this is something that's not
stopping on. Actually, we're preparing

133
00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.100
to go back down there
there's a weekend. We can

134
00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:45.400
have resistance. That's being planned
for the weekend about, from

135
00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.430
October 10th to the 13th. And
we were going back down

136
00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:50.890
there to cover that because
even in the past few

137
00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:54.010
days, it's been a, there
was a police officer shooting

138
00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.170
and then they were re
they responded to it, even

139
00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:58.000
though the police officers shooting
that had nothing to do

140
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.120
with the protests. It seems,
it seems it was a

141
00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:04.270
robbery that just, that went
wrong. And that's what happened

142
00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:07.120
with that. But of course,
it's all now being rolled

143
00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.790
into one thing about, about
Ferguson and then the problem,

144
00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:12.670
and they're trying to solve
it, I guess. And people

145
00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:15.540
are saying in this space,
in the space of, of

146
00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:18.520
social justice and the, in
the people focused on racial

147
00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.620
issues in America, that this
is the biggest thing since

148
00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:23.320
Selma. This is the voice
being heard since March of

149
00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.470
65, when 3,200 marches departed
from Selma to go to

150
00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:28.750
Montgomery, Alabama. And they walked
and they slept in fields

151
00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:30.940
and they, they really made
sure that their voices were

152
00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:33.550
heard. And this is going
to be the Selma Alabama

153
00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:38.050
of our generation. Would you
agree? I don't know is

154
00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:41.140
what I'm going to say.
Yes. I believe that we're,

155
00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:44.860
it's in history. I, we,
yes, this is a very

156
00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:47.560
historic time. I want to,
on one of our shows,

157
00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.530
historical blackness with dr. Blair
Kelly, she's a historian award

158
00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:54.700
winning author, and now she's
Dean over at to NC

159
00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:59.020
state. And she was talking
about this moment within history

160
00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.120
in which she reframed it.
I kind of like a,

161
00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:04.990
like a clicked cause you
go back to like, these

162
00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:07.600
shootings that's occurred and then
the trial. So you have

163
00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.120
the Zimmer of the Trayvon
Martin shooting and the Zimmerman

164
00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:14.590
trial. You have the Mike,
the, the Jordan Davis, Michael Dunn, and

165
00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:16.750
you're watching all of these
things connect. And so, and

166
00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:21.250
then we have Michael Brown Ferguson,
officer Wilson, and all these

167
00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:25.570
things are creating a bigger
moment overall. And so you

168
00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:27.910
can see how each one
of them adds to it.

169
00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:30.790
And actually, I haven't even
heard someone suggested that they,

170
00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:33.160
they believed that you could
start this period of time

171
00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:36.100
off with Katrina. And you
go back, go back that

172
00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:38.350
far and watch how all
this is happening. A lot

173
00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:40.420
of this has to do
with social media, the, the

174
00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:42.880
idea of that information, because
a lot of what's happening,

175
00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:46.990
the shootings and the police
actions, it's not new what's

176
00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:50.620
happening is that the information
is being moved faster and

177
00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:54.010
more people are now know
what's happening because of that.

178
00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:56.940
So Ferguson might not have
been on the evening news

179
00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:00.000
in the Bay area, but
on social media, I was

180
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.400
connected to it from, from
jump. All of a sudden,

181
00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.590
you just see Ferguson, the
shooting, blah, blah, blah. People

182
00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:06.030
are on the streets. You
start to see pictures, you've

183
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:08.940
seen videos of it. So
then you're automatically connected to

184
00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:12.150
something in a way that
even 10 years ago, hell

185
00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:14.910
five years ago, really, you
might not have been as

186
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:18.290
connected to, but now you
are. Exactly. And I think

187
00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:19.700
what's interesting and why I
wanted to have you on

188
00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:21.500
this show while this is
not a political show. It's

189
00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:25.130
more technology post show is
that the digital realm is

190
00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:28.850
affecting this because there's a
movement here towards not what

191
00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:31.520
we call professional journalism, where
you go to journalism school

192
00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:33.620
and you work for the
New York times and you are

193
00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:37.880
not a spectator at where
a journalist is, is, is

194
00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:41.090
watching and kind of judging
more towards what they call

195
00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:43.910
civic, journalism or public journalism,
where you really abandoned that

196
00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:47.690
idea. That I can't be
a spectator. I am in

197
00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:49.790
here. I have a vested
interest. I mean, do you

198
00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:54.020
now consider yourself a journalist,
ah, is a citizen journalism?

199
00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:57.950
Well, I would argue. It's
not quite like if you,

200
00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:00.770
if you ask me, is
it something like, I don't

201
00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:03.080
have a, a final answer
for you. And I, if

202
00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:05.300
you ask me tomorrow, maybe
I'll change my mind. But

203
00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:08.690
as of now, I'd argue
that it's, we're not citizen

204
00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:12.320
journalists because we are we're,
we're an organization, right? So

205
00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:16.240
as an organization, we've we
provide information while a lot

206
00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:18.260
of people have actually said
that they look at us

207
00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:21.890
as their specific news source.
I've had people who became

208
00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:24.440
subscribers, who then said that
they had just canceled their

209
00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:28.520
New York times subscription to come
subscribers, subscriber situation. So on

210
00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:31.430
one hand we are, we're
a media organization. And so

211
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:34.940
we're not, we're not that
we're not just citizens journalists,

212
00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:38.270
but at the same time,
am I a journalist? I

213
00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:40.940
would only argue, I would
always say yes, because of

214
00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:44.120
what I'm now seeing, because
of what I see other

215
00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:48.110
people who consider themselves journalists,
what they're doing. And I

216
00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:50.360
would argue that what they're
doing, I would have never

217
00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:53.990
said was journalism ever, even
while I was in Ferguson,

218
00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:55.940
I had an, a, there
was an interview with me

219
00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:00.050
and Tony Harris of Al
Jazeera. And dude was talking

220
00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:01.940
to me like we were
at, at a music festival.

221
00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:04.040
And it like, it ended
up becoming like kind of

222
00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.390
a thing, because on that
day it was, it was,

223
00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:09.740
I got interviewed by Al-Jazeera.
Patricia binds was interviewed on

224
00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:13.310
Fox and Todd quality got
interviewed by CNN. And that

225
00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:15.290
whole day, all three of
them, none of us did

226
00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:17.390
well with these interviews because
they were the way they

227
00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:20.240
were all, they were speaking
to us about this situation.

228
00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:22.610
And the fact that people
were here, like limit got

229
00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:26.030
thrown to the ground the
night before with, with Rosa

230
00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:30.410
Clemente, who was a journalist,
she actually ran for president,

231
00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:33.350
I think. And she, it
was so she got, she

232
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:35.720
was with him, they get
thrown to the ground. I

233
00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:37.820
had a, a big tear
gas a couple of days

234
00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:41.270
earlier. And I, and we're
all talking about like this,

235
00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:44.330
this, this tragedy here, and
the news is kind of

236
00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:47.780
having a different conversation completely.
And I feel as if

237
00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:50.420
it was that moment where
I think a lot of

238
00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:52.700
people, even though it's not
something, I can't say everyone,

239
00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:55.240
but a lot of people
realize that this was not,

240
00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:58.600
you can't, you can't look
at the media the same

241
00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:02.080
anymore. There is a very
clear difference in what stories

242
00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:04.390
are being told. And at
that point you have to

243
00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:09.520
become a more discerning consumer
of media, because if you

244
00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.740
want, actually want to know
what's true. You can't just

245
00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:14.440
turn to these, these three
spots that everyone on Fox

246
00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:17.970
medicine see CNN, whatever you
can't do that anymore. It's

247
00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:19.950
a great quote. I've been
reading up on the concept

248
00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:22.830
of citizen journalism. Cause I
wasn't sure if you'd have

249
00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:26.280
a strong opinion about that
either way, but the idea

250
00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:29.190
behind citizen journalism is that
this idea that people without

251
00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:33.780
formal training in journalism have
this opportunity with modern technology

252
00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:36.120
and basically the unlimited reach
of the internet to create

253
00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:39.360
this content that would otherwise
not be revealed. And I

254
00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:41.730
think that's the essence, I
think, is what is interesting

255
00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:44.430
of what you all are
doing is you are finding

256
00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:47.940
stories that are simply not
being told because of presumably

257
00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:52.680
the, the things that are
subjected to the gatekeeping practices

258
00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:56.190
of the traditional media, To
the point where it's confusing,

259
00:12:56.220 --> 00:13:00.030
even because I had, I
can't out folks, but I

260
00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:03.270
had folks over at, at
the Washington post, hit me

261
00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:06.030
up saying this is amazing
reporting. I wish they would

262
00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:09.570
let us report it. Like,
like puts us out. They

263
00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:12.570
would not allow. Cause we
had, like I said, well,

264
00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:14.820
one of the nights, the
big difference, the big difference

265
00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:17.430
between what we were doing.
And I believe what LA

266
00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:20.910
quote unquote mainstream was, was
that when I came into

267
00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:23.310
Ferguson, I didn't come in
with the press. There was

268
00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:26.040
press staging areas, all that
stuff. He didn't have fresh

269
00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:28.710
credentials. I mean, well, you
know, honestly, a lot of

270
00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:31.200
people didn't have press credentials.
People who were even quote

271
00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:33.870
unquote, actual press didn't have
press credentials. That wasn't really

272
00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:36.990
the thing. What was the
thing was that all the

273
00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:39.180
time. So over the first
couple of days, when the

274
00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:41.490
press finally got down there
that we, they were kind

275
00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:43.350
of sprinkled around on places.
And then all of a

276
00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:46.500
sudden press areas where we're
a forum like right by

277
00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:48.630
where the cutesy got burned
down, all of a sudden

278
00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:51.510
MSNBC kind of set up
a informal press area. And

279
00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:54.030
then we act radio was
down there and people started

280
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:56.850
working that way. But then
over time, once they realized

281
00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:59.730
that people weren't leaving these
credit press staging areas. So

282
00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:02.430
all the press were set
up on one specific spot.

283
00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:04.050
And at one point they'd
got, it was moved like

284
00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:05.940
about a mile mile and
a half away from where

285
00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:10.440
the main quote unquote mean
action ground zero of all

286
00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:13.680
this was occurring. And it
was, we weren't that from

287
00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:15.570
the beginning, we were all,
when I first got down

288
00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:17.940
there, when I first said
I'm coming down, it was

289
00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:21.540
the organizers saying, let us
know when you're here, that

290
00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:23.310
we connected to you. So
like I get down on

291
00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:25.560
the ground. There's a moment
where I think is probably

292
00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:29.130
the quintessential definition of the
difference between what we were

293
00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:31.260
doing and what CNN was
doing it. You could say

294
00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.600
if it was good or
bad on your own, but

295
00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:36.240
there's a moment where I
get down there, I'm talking

296
00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:38.310
to folks and one of
the organizers say, Elan, could

297
00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:41.000
you, could you grab a
bag of water to give

298
00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:42.720
to some folks? And I'm
like, okay. And I grabbed

299
00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:44.070
the, well, what am I
crap? I'm supposed to be

300
00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:46.500
reporting something, but like, okay,
I should give out water.

301
00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:49.800
And at that very moment,
Don lemon is surrounded by

302
00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:53.300
five bodyguards. I'm talking to
the camera and you can't

303
00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:55.850
even like, you can't even
get nearby the dollar limit

304
00:14:56.410 --> 00:14:58.960
Versus your CNN anchor for
people who don't know. Right.

305
00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:01.030
And so I feel like
that probably is the moment

306
00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:03.730
that kind of like defines
the difference between the story

307
00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:05.530
that we're going to tell
the story that are going

308
00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:07.390
to tell, you know what
I mean? Yeah, Absolutely. I

309
00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:10.240
mean, there is, there's a
sense of being embedded, but

310
00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:13.440
I think another thing that,
for me, that changes what,

311
00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:15.460
what I would think of
as a civic journalist or

312
00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:20.290
public journalism is this idea
that you might have not

313
00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:23.410
you personally, but you have
a vested interest, like many

314
00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:27.670
citizen journalists, aren't just assigned
the job and sent down

315
00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:30.250
there. I mean, Don lemon
may have been given the

316
00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:32.770
job and sent down there
for a number of reasons,

317
00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:36.460
but ultimately those someone made
the assignment, well, a citizen

318
00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:38.680
journalist may have a certain
vested interest. Like I need

319
00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:41.050
to get down there. Like
you said, if the audience

320
00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:43.870
wants us there, we'll go
down there. Right. And I

321
00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:46.570
mean, also I call shenanigans.
I mean, one of the

322
00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:49.510
reasons why I've always pushed
back when, even the concept

323
00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:53.770
of quote unquote, being a
journalist, because, because I always

324
00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:56.260
felt as if the idea
of journalism is that you,

325
00:15:56.260 --> 00:16:00.070
you, you put forward this,
this, this story without any,

326
00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:03.340
without any of your own
biases, it was a straight

327
00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:05.980
forward story. What I've learned
over the past six years,

328
00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:07.930
since Twitter has been formed.
And a lot of what

329
00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:11.170
we've done is a lot
of media critique. And what

330
00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:14.260
I've learned is that it's
a it's, it's, it's, it's

331
00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:16.720
silly. It's like people always
have their biases in it.

332
00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:19.480
And so the question is
whether or not your bias

333
00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:22.960
will, will, will change the,
the, the, the whole content

334
00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:25.870
of the story. And for
us, I try to always

335
00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:28.600
make sure that I flat
out say, this is my

336
00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:31.510
issue. This is where I'm
coming from. But also let's

337
00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:34.930
look at the counter argument.
So we get a reputation

338
00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:37.570
of being a no BS
overall. Like we're not where

339
00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:38.830
we're going to be in
your face. We're going to

340
00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:41.620
say exactly. What's what, what
we think is right. No

341
00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:44.800
matter what, whereas if I,
in a world of that,

342
00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:47.530
I'm a quote, unquote journalist.
I couldn't flat out say,

343
00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:50.890
this is, I'm not going
to give the side of

344
00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:53.500
the officer limits. I'm not
gonna spend a half hour

345
00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:56.610
going. Well, the officer said
like, no, because that, that

346
00:16:56.650 --> 00:16:58.780
is not the officer's going
to get his say. And

347
00:16:58.780 --> 00:16:59.920
all of a sudden people
are going to cover it.

348
00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:01.390
Like if you looked at
the news, they did a

349
00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:04.570
lot of that, even though
the, the cold hard facts

350
00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:07.240
is that an unarmed kid
with four witnesses saying he

351
00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:09.430
was unarmed and had his
hands up was shot. And

352
00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:11.920
then a cop was a,
was a shuttle shuffled off

353
00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:14.140
and then went into hiding
and then went on paid

354
00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:17.050
vacation for the next, how
many, whatever weeks some sense

355
00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:19.870
happened. That is, those are
just the facts of the

356
00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:23.470
case. And I cannot stop
and go. What about the

357
00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:26.320
feelings of the cop? It's
like, no, that's not, that's

358
00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:28.540
not the story here. The
story is of a city

359
00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:31.060
that's being occupied by a
police presence. The story is

360
00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:35.260
of the, of the, the
police, our military realization and,

361
00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:39.520
and I, and attack really
of a peaceful protest because

362
00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:43.210
of what they were worried
about. How do we, how

363
00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:45.340
do we As, how do
I, as a consumer of

364
00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:48.430
the news, get the full
story, get the sense of

365
00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:51.060
the fullness, these things in
a world that's 140 characters

366
00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:53.160
at a time. Have we,
as a culture, lost the

367
00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:57.330
attention span for a complicated
multi-month long story with nuance.

368
00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:00.800
Well, I don't believe we
ever had it. I mean,

369
00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:03.980
for you to say that
we lost it imply that

370
00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:05.930
at some point we were
just, we were just so

371
00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:09.110
good. And we would watch
things, The economist cover to

372
00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:12.530
cover like, like No, and
I, and most people haven't

373
00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:15.080
as a society. That's never
what we've been, what we've

374
00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:16.490
done. Now. A lot of
people like to make the

375
00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:20.870
argument that, Oh, it's, it's
now it's 140 characters. It's

376
00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:23.510
the bind generation. It's like,
well, yes, that is an

377
00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:27.320
aspect of things. But like
my grandfather, wasn't a watching

378
00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:30.530
a five hour debates on
anything like that either. So

379
00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:32.420
you also, if you want
to have, if you want

380
00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:35.210
to learn about what's happening,
you want to consume a

381
00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:38.750
what's actually happening. You have
to do some work. You

382
00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:41.120
have to take some of
that responsibility and go forth

383
00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:43.400
and go, Hey, I don't,
I know that they said

384
00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:45.440
this, but I'm going to
go check something else. Like

385
00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:48.380
a really silly version of
this, a, a shame. I'm

386
00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:50.750
not sharing a Scott. I
have my, one of my

387
00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:53.840
folks is named Shane. I
apologize. A prime example of

388
00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:56.090
this was this morning, there
was a, someone had taken

389
00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:58.070
an image and they had
posted it. And the image

390
00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:01.160
was about, it is something
really silly about Kanye West.

391
00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:04.130
And there's a Kanye West
and Kim Kardashian. And the

392
00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:06.950
picture was of a Jordan Sparks
and her boyfriend going to

393
00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:09.080
do two things. Right. And
so the image in it,

394
00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:12.050
and everyone was like, seriously.
And so everyone, seriously, seriously,

395
00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:14.210
this is so sad. This
is, they just, they don't

396
00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:16.820
even like that, whatever I
looked at and said, Oh

397
00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:20.390
seriously, but the first thing
I did was go look

398
00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:22.430
up the article. Cause I
was like, what was the

399
00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:24.800
explanation? What did they do?
The tweet already did? What

400
00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.560
did they delete It from
somewhere else on the page?

401
00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:30.500
Facebook polls, previews, who knows?
I looked it up the

402
00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:34.880
find out that it was
a slideshow about the biggest

403
00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:38.330
breakups that's happened within Hollywood.
And it was Jordan spars.

404
00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:40.760
But the title was about
camera Rose. Cause that was

405
00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:43.250
what the Amber Rose. And I'm
sorry, Amber Rose and whiskey for

406
00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:45.860
not a Cameron or something.
And that was why they

407
00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:48.110
had that title. They were
talking about that. But then

408
00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:50.090
be like, Oh, and then
look at some other breakups.

409
00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:52.370
But that's what that's right
there as a prime example

410
00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:54.380
of what you have to
do within your media. Cause

411
00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:56.360
that's something silly. That's like
who the hell cares about

412
00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:58.820
whiskey for an Amber Rose breaking
up. But if this was

413
00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:02.260
about, let's say Ferguson and
a cop being shot, like,

414
00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:04.130
like all of a sudden
that Woodell thing that you

415
00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:06.140
might've saw that could have
gone either way, it could

416
00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:08.660
have been like really anti-cop
necessarily, or it could be

417
00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:11.510
anti protestors on necessarily. He
could be either way, but

418
00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:13.220
you have to take the
time to go. You know

419
00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:15.170
what, let me just, let
me check on that. Like,

420
00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:17.150
just like when you ever
see those, those stories that

421
00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:22.760
are obviously <inaudible> Eric, Eric Holder
just got a $77 million job

422
00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:29.540
with JP Morgan chase satire.
Really? Gosh, everyone's like that.

423
00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:31.160
Didn't take long for him
to get a job. I'm

424
00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:33.410
like, come on you guys,
To me, that's not like,

425
00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:35.180
I feel like some of
these sites that consider themselves

426
00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:38.750
satire as someone who traffics
within satire myself, I call

427
00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:42.610
shenanigans on it. It's not
subtitle. It's just literally an

428
00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:45.980
entirely fabricated story with a
little bit like made you

429
00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:49.200
look at the right. One
of the things that I

430
00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:52.740
wanted to cover with you
though, is that you're you're,

431
00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:54.270
you're so new now. And
we don't know, we don't

432
00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:57.630
know the noun. It's it's
social commentary. It's advocacy, it's

433
00:20:57.630 --> 00:21:01.290
digital advocacy. It is not
quite journalism, but it's more

434
00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:04.830
somehow maybe the word hasn't
been invented, but when you're

435
00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:08.670
down there, you're seeing you're
capturing images. Like when you,

436
00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:11.520
if you can go to
twig twiv.fm and you can

437
00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:15.000
take a look at the
live dispatches from Ferguson, because

438
00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.090
suddenly journalism, at least from
the perspective of a consumer,

439
00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:21.390
like myself becomes different. When
I'm looking at video, as

440
00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:25.950
it happens, you were down
there shooting live video vines,

441
00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:30.750
you know, video audio. We
had long audio moments where

442
00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:33.330
there was no dispute. This
isn't something where we're going

443
00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:35.610
to argue about this happen
or that happened. I can

444
00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:39.390
see the tape. How does
this change? When we've got

445
00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:43.230
high definition, multiple angles from
everywhere. Do we need five

446
00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:45.390
hours of commentary when we
have a five second vine

447
00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:48.480
that makes it clear what
happened? Yeah. It depends on,

448
00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:51.060
it depends on the situation
because that, that, that five

449
00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:53.220
second vine I, and by
the way, we just so

450
00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:55.170
that people aren't like, Oh,
he's not, that's not true.

451
00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:59.280
We didn't use vine. We
no, it's no problem. What

452
00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:01.980
we ended up doing was,
and it's actually a part

453
00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:03.570
of my page. I can't
go back to for awhile.

454
00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:06.810
We were using Instagram. So
Instagram had the 15 second

455
00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:09.870
clip. Oh, long ago. Yes.
Oh. So I, and I

456
00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:13.080
specifically used Instagram because of
the 15 second versus the,

457
00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:14.730
the six second. And I
wanted to be able to

458
00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:16.980
get more information out. So
we did like loose clips.

459
00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:18.930
Like when the church got
raided, I got there and

460
00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:21.510
I had clips of the
people talking about it in

461
00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:23.850
15, second burst. When I,
when we found out about

462
00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:26.700
it, I told everyone in
those 15, second bursts as

463
00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:29.070
dispatch, it's like, we're, I'm
on my way there. This

464
00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:31.350
is what happened. But within
a 15 second clip so

465
00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:35.370
that it could be easily
consumed, but it depends. So,

466
00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:38.370
but that's one aspect of
it. That's not a debate

467
00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:42.300
about what's actually happening. That's
not a debate about how

468
00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:44.640
we got here. What's the
best way of fixing this

469
00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:47.160
with policy organized and things
like that. So that's when

470
00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:50.970
long form is as better.
Whereas getting the information out,

471
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.860
that was my goal at
that time. So when I'm

472
00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:56.550
sending out 15, second Instagram
videos of us being gassed

473
00:22:56.580 --> 00:23:00.570
by the police, while laying
on our bellies, hiding from

474
00:23:00.570 --> 00:23:03.690
the cops in someone's backyard,
that was, that's why we

475
00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:06.180
use that was that's a
15 second moment. Like this

476
00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:08.580
is what's happened now. I
need you wherever you are

477
00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:10.500
in the world. Cause a
lot of international folks was

478
00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:13.890
following this. I following me,
I ended up gaining, I

479
00:23:13.890 --> 00:23:17.040
think 10 or 12,000 new
followers within the week and

480
00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:19.290
a half that I was
down there because people were

481
00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:21.000
like trying to find out,
well what's happening. I call

482
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.300
a lot of it, a
tragedy porn, but a lot

483
00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:25.620
of, a lot of folks
were like, I didn't know

484
00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:27.900
what was going on. And
we needed to know people

485
00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:30.840
they're saying exactly like, because
we, I would just record

486
00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:33.210
it. And so you can
decide if you think I'm

487
00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:36.660
wrong, fine, but you heard
what just happened right now.

488
00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:39.180
You decide what you think
happened. Right. It's absolutely amazing

489
00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:41.010
that in the seven years
that I've been on Twitter,

490
00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:44.700
how I'm seeing the miracle
on the Hudson, as it

491
00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:48.560
happens, know I'm seeing news
and I'm seeing it three,

492
00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:53.480
five, six hours before it
hits cnn.com as a spectator,

493
00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:55.370
as a consumer of news,
I'm finding that to be

494
00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:59.870
absolutely extraordinary. And you've got
big ideas about basically setting

495
00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:04.250
up multi hundred thousand dollar
kind of live satellite streaming,

496
00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:08.090
but on your back in
a way that is, it

497
00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:10.220
has, I haven't seen before.
Talk to me about your

498
00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:13.970
plans for going back down
to Ferguson and, and giving

499
00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:16.120
us the news that we
want to see. So, So

500
00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:17.710
I, when I, last time
I was in Ferguson, I

501
00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:18.910
was talking to some of
the folks over at, we

502
00:24:18.910 --> 00:24:21.730
act radio and I was
tired. I was complaining about

503
00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:24.850
the idea of, of the
connections going in and out

504
00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:26.530
like that's, that's one of
the reasons why we didn't

505
00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:31.240
do any video, like live
video streams, because I was

506
00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:33.550
worried about the connection. Cause
like the only connection I

507
00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:36.460
had that was a short
fire was my LTE connection

508
00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:39.160
on my, on my, on
my iPhone. And so I

509
00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:42.100
ended up using that as
a connection for audio, because

510
00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:44.080
I didn't want to attacks
it with trying to push

511
00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:47.440
a full, a full video
because at this point, and

512
00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:49.060
I know this is an
ADR, maybe I'm a, I'm

513
00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:51.400
being a tech snob or
something like that for ADP

514
00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:53.860
is not really doing it.
I can't see half, half

515
00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:55.960
what's happening. It's like, it's
super small. You can't really

516
00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:57.520
see details. So I want
to do it an HD,

517
00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:59.080
but it wasn't gonna work
that way. And I was

518
00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:00.310
talking to them and they'd
be like, Oh, you know,

519
00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:02.350
those, these backpacks that you
can do like full on

520
00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:05.260
a broadcast from, but it
cost like $20,000. And I

521
00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:07.870
was like, I can't afford
that. But then again, I'm

522
00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:09.790
an, I'm an excit guy.
I'm a tech person. So

523
00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:11.770
I, every time these things
happen, I'm always trying to

524
00:25:11.770 --> 00:25:14.800
figure out the technical method
to fix this problem. How

525
00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:17.590
do we get this going?
And so I was looking

526
00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:19.150
at it and I saw
the backpack. So all the

527
00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:23.920
backpacks were, were fancy methods
of connecting to a bunch

528
00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:27.460
of different hotspots at once
creating a, creating the watch

529
00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:30.370
while the whole HD pipe.
And so I'm like we

530
00:25:30.370 --> 00:25:32.260
should be able to do
that on our own. And

531
00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:33.430
it was something that I
was looking at. I was

532
00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:34.720
thinking about it. And then
I just happened to go

533
00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:38.770
pass by some software. That
actually that is what they

534
00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:42.520
do. They specifically connect to
multiple different connections to create

535
00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:44.410
one pipe. And I'm like,
huh. So that means that

536
00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:46.180
if I can connect, I'll
get a couple of a

537
00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:50.020
Y hotspots, which I mean
a Verizon hotspot, which does

538
00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:52.660
LTE four G LTE, you
can get one for like

539
00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:55.720
a hundred and something bucks.
And then the, the cost

540
00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:57.340
per month is if you
want to do like a

541
00:25:57.340 --> 00:26:00.160
full month is $90. So
you got you grab five

542
00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:02.620
of these, you get a,
you pay the month charge

543
00:26:02.770 --> 00:26:04.060
or you can do less
if you want it like

544
00:26:04.090 --> 00:26:06.310
a warm up to it.
And you w with a

545
00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:09.760
laptop they've loved the, the
wifi spots on you. And

546
00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:12.010
then you have a laptop
running a server that actually

547
00:26:12.010 --> 00:26:15.430
creates a wifi, use a
wifi of network with all

548
00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:19.120
of those things. So that
any wifi technology you have

549
00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:23.530
near you can jump on
your now mobile HD connection.

550
00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:25.720
You now can. So people
who like, like one of

551
00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:27.280
the issues we were having
was trying to get images

552
00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:29.710
up, getting videos up because
we couldn't, it was too,

553
00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:32.020
it was a, a, the
connection was bad, but now

554
00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:33.970
you drop on our wifi.
You can just put it

555
00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:37.090
up immediately. We can actually
get that information out. And

556
00:26:37.090 --> 00:26:39.280
then I was looking at
like DC converters, so that

557
00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:41.820
all of a sudden the
car that we have becomes

558
00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.520
a watch model, a, a
surge protector that we can

559
00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:47.160
connect all of our electronics
into. So all of a

560
00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:49.680
sudden, now I can bring
down a little, a little,

561
00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:52.770
what's called a TV studio
in a box, connect, three

562
00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:54.690
cameras to it. And we
can do a full on

563
00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:57.390
three cameras shoot from a
mobile position at that moment,

564
00:26:57.610 --> 00:26:59.970
stuff that at one point
you could not imagine happening

565
00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:03.510
w w without having the
backing of a, of a

566
00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:07.620
full on NBC or ABC,
now, people a spaces in

567
00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:09.990
these spaces like us can
do that long along as

568
00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:13.350
we use the knowhow that
luckily like we have here

569
00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:17.180
at twig and the technology
that's available. Absolutely. So people,

570
00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:20.000
people who have these hotspots
are told that they will

571
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.150
do seven megabits and that's,
you know, not moving, sitting

572
00:27:23.150 --> 00:27:26.390
on the ledge of your
hotel window. Usually you can

573
00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:29.540
get Netflix going. But what
you're saying is you get

574
00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:31.280
one from sprint, you get
one from Verizon getting one

575
00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:33.950
from at and T and
you chain them together into

576
00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:37.490
one chaired spot that utilizes
what's underneath it. And you've

577
00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:40.600
got a reliable network connection.
And I mean, I mean,

578
00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:43.190
of course things happen in,
I, it could, there could

579
00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:45.080
be a still issues. I
mean, the fact is that

580
00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:48.230
we've watched major major networks,
all of a sudden say

581
00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:50.630
lose connection. Like, Oh, we've
lost connection with the personal

582
00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:52.640
of the field. And those
people have millions of dollars

583
00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:54.770
to invest in that. So
losing a connection here and

584
00:27:54.770 --> 00:27:57.800
there, it's not the biggest
problem, but because of technology,

585
00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:59.870
because of how we do
things like the fact that

586
00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:02.960
like, when we were broadcasting
on my audio only stream

587
00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:05.510
that there were hundreds upon
hundreds of retweets. So people

588
00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:07.310
are going listen to the
stream, listen to the stream

589
00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:09.740
right now. Right. It's happening
right now. He's in Ferguson

590
00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:13.520
in that area go listen.
And it changed the entire

591
00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:16.100
conversation around that. And so
like a little space like

592
00:28:16.130 --> 00:28:18.290
us that doesn't have all
that funding, which, I mean,

593
00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:20.930
we had funding, it would
be ridiculous, but, but basically

594
00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:25.790
creating our own space, having
our audience subscribe and pay

595
00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:28.730
for what we do. And
now we can, we can

596
00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:33.650
actively challenge the main stream
media with millions upon millions

597
00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:36.770
of corporate dollars. We are
saying you're wrong. And you're

598
00:28:36.770 --> 00:28:38.540
going to have to deal
with this. And I mean,

599
00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:40.880
I w I was, I
ended up going on MSNBC

600
00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:43.220
the week or the week
after I had, I was

601
00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:46.010
down there. And that's where
the first time that it

602
00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:49.520
was a plate on national
television, that the, the, the

603
00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:52.060
story that captain Ron Johnson
then was talking about one

604
00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:53.870
of those nights where they're
like, Oh, there wasn't really

605
00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:55.610
a, a, the gas was
only there. So it was

606
00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:57.830
only the protesters and writers.
And it also, you get

607
00:28:57.830 --> 00:29:00.710
to hear me in a
car with organizes by ourselves.

608
00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:04.550
No writers, no protesters are
around driving into the city,

609
00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:07.550
the, of the area, see
six people running towards us.

610
00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:10.040
And you can hear the
reaction. You can see when

611
00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:12.380
the, the, all of a
sudden they start shooting the

612
00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:14.480
tear gas canisters. You can
hear all of that for

613
00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:17.480
yourselves. And it changes the
entire discussion. Yes, Absolutely. And

614
00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:19.490
I think that your point
to go back just a

615
00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:22.250
little bit, your point about
not being for ADP also

616
00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:25.040
changes the discussion. I think,
you know, citizen journalism is

617
00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:28.430
great, but vertical video syndrome
sucks. Like you think that

618
00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:30.710
something would happen and we
could actually see it in

619
00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:32.630
HD, by someone who knows
how to hold a camera

620
00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:36.530
straight. I personally would love
to see a GoPro, not

621
00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:38.480
on the head of a
BMX biker, but on your

622
00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:44.170
head streaming, there's the new
wifi Backpack from Gulf GoPro

623
00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:46.840
connected to your stream. And
we've got a live there

624
00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:50.080
in wherever the news is
happening. And with commentary, that

625
00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:52.690
would be amazing, dude. I'm
trying, I guess that might

626
00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:55.930
sound funny. I'm trying to
buy a drone. That's another

627
00:29:55.930 --> 00:29:58.270
great idea. They're not expensive.
Like you can get, you

628
00:29:58.270 --> 00:30:00.640
can get a drone for
a few hundred dollars, if

629
00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:02.980
you, if you find the
right spot and like put

630
00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:05.470
it up there. Like we,
we saw like actually Al

631
00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:07.780
Jazeera had a drone out
there last time we were

632
00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:09.130
there. And I was like,
how much has the drone

633
00:30:09.130 --> 00:30:10.960
and that sort of doing
research, like I've found drones

634
00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:12.850
for three, $400. Well, I
would go a little bit

635
00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:15.490
upscale. I'd get like a,
like a parrot AR drone

636
00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:17.710
to you get seven 20,
30 frames a second out

637
00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:20.920
of that, obviously. Yeah. I,
depending on how much of

638
00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:22.840
that cost, if it was
within our budget, I would

639
00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:26.110
totally do that because I
believe at this point, being

640
00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:29.170
able to grab these things,
get it out there, we

641
00:30:29.170 --> 00:30:33.040
can change the entire narrative
around any of these things.

642
00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:36.070
So many times we hear
conflicting stories and I'm not

643
00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:37.840
a big fan of conflicting
stories. And the fact, I

644
00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:39.820
mean, that was also one
of the reasons why I

645
00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:42.730
was in Ferguson, because I
was seeing people say stuff.

646
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.800
And I'm like, I don't
know if you're telling me,

647
00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:46.930
I don't know if you're
you're right. Hell either people

648
00:30:46.930 --> 00:30:49.570
that I trust that I
have met, I like, and

649
00:30:49.570 --> 00:30:52.510
I believe they are good
people and are not attempting

650
00:30:52.690 --> 00:30:55.360
to mislead anyone. And I'm
not sure I would trust

651
00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:57.730
them with certain things. So
that's why I feel the

652
00:30:57.730 --> 00:30:59.980
need to go down there
and show as much as

653
00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:02.200
possible. You can report it
or you can show it.

654
00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:04.390
And when you show it,
it's a very different discussion.

655
00:31:04.390 --> 00:31:05.920
All of a sudden people
have to deal with the

656
00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:08.680
fact that they can debate
me over a tweet or

657
00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:11.200
something, but you can't debate
a picture, even though people,

658
00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:12.700
by the way, were trying
to debate me about the

659
00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:16.600
audio being gas, like Photoshop,
must've Photoshop that audio, someone

660
00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:18.820
actually yelled at me saying
that like, Oh, with all

661
00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:20.920
those cameras out there, you
could only get audio. It's

662
00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:23.440
like we were by ourselves.
Remember when the press got

663
00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:26.170
escorted out of Ferguson. And
we were the only ones

664
00:31:26.170 --> 00:31:28.960
still there. I'm sorry that
I don't have a, a

665
00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:31.870
full, like a light crew.
And, and, and Tina ADP

666
00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:34.270
video for you, but that's
what we had. And that's

667
00:31:34.270 --> 00:31:36.160
what we told the story
with. But in my mind,

668
00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:37.720
in the back of my
head, I was going, you

669
00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:39.170
know what? I gotta figure
out a way to get

670
00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:41.110
more video. I gotta get
more quality. I want as

671
00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:43.420
much proof as possible at
all times. So when I

672
00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:46.060
say something, I'm not just
saying it, I have all

673
00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:47.650
the proof in the world,
right. When you get this

674
00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:50.440
backpack, like just like Justin
TV, if you remember those

675
00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:52.300
guys that kind of a
style situation, but in full

676
00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:55.360
HD, that is going to
be really amazing. Yup. And,

677
00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:58.270
and that's my plan. Well,
