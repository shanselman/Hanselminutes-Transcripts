talks with his dad, David
Hanselman, about the trials and

8
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.420
tribulations of raising a computer
person. Hi, this is Scott

9
00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.820
Hanselman and this is another
episode of Hansel minutes and

10
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.690
I'm sitting here with my
dad and good afternoon. Hi

11
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.720
dad. I thought it would
be cool to have you

12
00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.370
on the show. And I
know you think it's weird.

13
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.160
You kind of got this
look on your face, like,

14
00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:16.310
and we're talking about what
and computers, what are computers?

15
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.610
Yeah, it's a little uneasy,
but you can, we can

16
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.710
handle it. We can handle
it. So, you know, I

17
00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.800
have this, it's a, this
is a podcast, right? People

18
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.930
will get this on their,
on their iPod automatically iPod.

19
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:35.450
Is that anything like an
eight track? Yeah, yeah. <inaudible>

20
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.600
yes I do. But they're
going to get it automatically.

21
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.400
It's like, it's a second
subscription. So it's like a

22
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.540
radio show except there's no
radio and well, arguably there's

23
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.880
not even a show at
this point. Right. But it's

24
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.530
early yet. It's early. Who
knows? Who knows, but, you

25
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:52.730
know, I thought it'd be
interesting to just talk to

26
00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.840
you and talk about how,
how, how, how hard it

27
00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.270
was to put up with
me growing up and with

28
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.150
my brother. And what w
was it different to raise

29
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.000
a geek and whatnot, but
so you were a fireman

30
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.170
for 30. I was a
firefighter for 30 years in

31
00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.620
Portland. So for the listeners
that are from countries that

32
00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.120
are not the U S
there's a lot of wood

33
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.550
houses in the U S
yeah. All, most of the

34
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.490
homes in the Northwest are
built out of wood. And

35
00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.680
so consequently firefighters are needed
and they are looked upon

36
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.720
favorably by the public for
the most part. And I

37
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.360
was fortunate enough to work
for the city of Portland

38
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:39.320
fire department from the early
seventies, up until 2002. And

39
00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.470
I retired there after 30
years now, firefighters, they don't

40
00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.610
just save buildings from fires,
but they also, they save

41
00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.320
people like if you have
a heart attack in the

42
00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.200
U S you'll call a
firefighter, right? The nine one,

43
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.850
one system pretty much nationwide.
And I think it's starting

44
00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.770
to even internationally, we'll bring
a fire department for a

45
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.480
medical Emergency or for fires
or any kind of emergency

46
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.610
that's ness, you know, that
you need, you need help

47
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.030
with. I was a paramedic
for the last 15 years

48
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.500
and was a Lieutenant in
charge of a crew. And

49
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.930
we'd take the, we would
respond with the fire engine

50
00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.470
and for people and all
our medical equipment and our

51
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.270
firefighting equipment. And we would
be mobile enough with the

52
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:31.570
advent of the, an improvement
of radios. The communication system

53
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.790
allowed us to go pretty
well anywhere we were needed.

54
00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.610
And so that's how I
spent my 30 years. So

55
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.410
at the beginning, I mean,
it's considered a pretty decent

56
00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.110
job. Right? Good job. You
bet. You're not going to

57
00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.860
get rich, but it was
certainly a job that you

58
00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:52.260
can, it's a lifestyle. It's
a it's choices. You make,

59
00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.230
you know, it, I could
have made more money probably

60
00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.680
in the private sector, but
I grew up in an

61
00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:05.850
era of security being important.
My mother raised three of

62
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.910
us by herself after my
dad died, when we were

63
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.300
quite young. And so security
was always something that we

64
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.390
were very aware of or
the lack of security. And

65
00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:16.800
so when I had a
chance to get with the

66
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:22.440
fire department, it was a
choice that I, I didn't

67
00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.060
know what I was getting
into, but I'm certainly glad

68
00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.040
I got there. But when
you met mom, you were

69
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.650
bagging groceries. When I, yeah.
When I met your mother,

70
00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.160
I was still bagging groceries
and going to school part

71
00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.640
time. Yeah. And while I
say bagging groceries, that by

72
00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.670
then I was, I think
I was third man at

73
00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:41.340
a Thriftway store or something
like that. And back then,

74
00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.220
actually, when I went in
the fire department, I made,

75
00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.990
I had to take a
pay cut from being a

76
00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.710
grocery clerk. I had better
benefits. I had better really

77
00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.300
a monthly salary being a
grocery clerk. But within a

78
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.630
period of a year, once
I came on full time

79
00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.930
with the fire department, it
kinda, it bounced. And then

80
00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.630
over the years, of course
surpassed what the grocery clerks,

81
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.840
Not even then. I remember
growing up that you had

82
00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.000
other jobs, you would always
do something on the side.

83
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.890
Was that because you were
bored or did we need,

84
00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:12.060
we needed the money? I
mean, I don't know. I

85
00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.260
was five so, Well, I
started working a second job

86
00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:18.240
right out, as soon as
I got out of training

87
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.060
with the fire department. Cause
it didn't pay that much.

88
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.440
And I was, you know,
we were young, married, couple.

89
00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.640
My wife had worked before
with the gas company, but

90
00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:33.420
then when you came along,
we made a conscious choice

91
00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:37.350
to have a parent at
home. We both came from

92
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:41.550
single parents scenarios. So the
idea of having someone at

93
00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.530
home was real important to
both of us. And so

94
00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:45.600
we made a conscious choice
that I would work a

95
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.710
second job and she would
stay home and be a

96
00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.500
parent. And you know, it'd
be mother and father actually

97
00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:55.140
for a while there. And
so I was driving oil

98
00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:58.730
truck during the winter, I'd
lay asphalt the summer I

99
00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:03.560
did a handyman work, you
know, for a couple of

100
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:08.390
different guys. I knew had
businesses repair businesses. We also

101
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:12.890
did what they call millwork
going into new construction and

102
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:16.730
casing out windows and putting
in doors and things like

103
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:20.840
that. So I kept busy
for the first I was

104
00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.770
working two jobs for probably
10 to 15 years. And

105
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:28.700
then finally, when I got
promoted to Lieutenant and things

106
00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.820
started taking shape a little
better, we decided we'll live

107
00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.900
off the one salary. And
when was the first time

108
00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.600
that this is a tenant,
this will sound like a

109
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.170
weird segue, but I'm going
somewhere with this. When was

110
00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:42.040
the first time you saw
a computer even thought about

111
00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.680
that term and the idea
of technology, as opposed to

112
00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:49.630
just typewriters and tell us,
I have vivid memories of

113
00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:53.230
typewriters of the, when I
first came in the fire

114
00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:57.070
department, we used an old,
like a pegboard system with

115
00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:01.090
little plugs that, and it
was a teletype. It was

116
00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:04.510
like an old teletype from
the thirties. And that is

117
00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:09.250
how they communicated and that,
and telephone, hardwired telephone. There

118
00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:15.070
was one heavy, maybe five
pound, two way radio that

119
00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:17.920
was carried by the each
officer on each fire engine.

120
00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:23.710
There were no computers, none
at all in the Bureau,

121
00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.650
at least not at the
stations. Not that the individual

122
00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:32.770
fire companies dealt with it
was strictly mainframes. Oh no.

123
00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:36.490
The mainframe was a wooden
peg board with plugs with

124
00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:39.790
that, like a cribbage board,
but on the wall, on

125
00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:42.940
the wall, like a cribbage
or a, or a Parcheesi

126
00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:46.180
board and the numbers that
related to the numbers of

127
00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:49.960
the fire engines. And they
would, we had codes like

128
00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:54.370
a teletype code Telegraph code
that they would punch over

129
00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:57.970
this system. And then we
would, from that knowledge and

130
00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:01.780
from learning that code, we
would put these different companies

131
00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:05.020
into the appropriate plugs, if
you will. And we'd know

132
00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:07.210
that they were in service
or out of service, they

133
00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:11.380
were available or not available.
And then know whether we

134
00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:13.570
would be closer to taking
the next run and all

135
00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.890
that and hard telephone. Oh,
so you're getting, you're getting

136
00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:19.750
this feed, this teletype feed
and you go, Oh, it's

137
00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:21.850
a five 29. And I
got to go up on

138
00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:25.000
the board and some guy
updates. It's always someone monitoring

139
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.730
the board and the teletype
screen. That was the big

140
00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:29.830
screen. That was the mainframe.
If you will, for that

141
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:32.920
fire station back in 71
72. And when you get

142
00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:34.210
a rep, when you get
to come back from a

143
00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:36.850
fire, you type it up
in a report with typewriters

144
00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:41.470
Typewriter. Oh yeah. Everybody had
a big Smith Coronas with

145
00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:44.380
that were, could handle legal
size paper. I mean, it

146
00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:48.400
was big electric typewriters, but
Now my brother, my younger

147
00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:52.900
brother, Josh is a fireman
and he firefighter, he, we

148
00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:55.980
don't say fire man. Oh
no, no fire is women

149
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.240
firefighters. There are women firefighters
And on his, on his

150
00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:01.820
crew, that's one firefighter. So
he, he types it into

151
00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:05.330
some windows application and it's
all. Yeah. I believe it's

152
00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:09.380
a windows application and a
central database. What they call

153
00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:13.610
MDTs mobile data terminals. They
have them on in each

154
00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:17.810
fire engine in front of
the officer, they've got a

155
00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:22.670
touch screen. They have a
keyboard, they have different methods

156
00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:27.140
or different ways that they
can do it. And then

157
00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:29.900
of course, when they, they
can communicate via that and

158
00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:35.060
get information regarding residences or
commercial buildings that they're responding

159
00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:36.680
to, they can just type
in an address and they

160
00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:41.540
can tell you whether there's
hazardous materials there or what

161
00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:43.970
other things they need to
be aware of before they

162
00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:48.620
go in. So I, I
remember when I think the

163
00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:50.750
first computer I saw was
some kind of Apple computer,

164
00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:56.390
fourth grade, fifth grade, somewhere
in there when I was

165
00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:59.090
kind of a, what would
you say? What? I was

166
00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:01.520
going to say, rambunctious child.
But I was to think,

167
00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:05.900
thank you, dad. Yeah, you
were, you were a handful.

168
00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:09.380
Okay. A handful I'd have
to say now. Well, that's

169
00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:12.230
being nice. We are on
the air, right? Yes we

170
00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:15.110
are. You're on the air.
Thank you, dad. You were

171
00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:18.770
a handful. You were a
precocious. That's another adjective that

172
00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:22.640
was used back then. Rambunctious.
I guess I would have

173
00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:25.580
been on Ritalin. Yeah. If
they'd had it, they, you

174
00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:27.830
would have been on it
probably. But this is the

175
00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:29.780
seventies we're talking about. This
is the early seventies and

176
00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:32.960
you're but your mother and
I both, I mean, there

177
00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:36.650
were people who suggested that
we consider, you know, medicating

178
00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:40.880
you if you will. But
that option didn't appeal to

179
00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:43.850
us. Really. We felt that
less seriously. No, I'm not.

180
00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:47.420
That's right. This is news.
I appreciate that. As I

181
00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:49.730
remember it, now, your mother
may remember it differently. You

182
00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:52.460
know, we'll have her on
next year. Yeah. I'm told

183
00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:54.980
I have selective memory. So
I have no idea whether

184
00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:57.230
this is, this is the
way I remember it. It's

185
00:10:57.230 --> 00:11:00.950
about 30 years. There was
a, yeah, really. There were

186
00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:05.450
times when they suggested that,
that we consider medication and

187
00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:07.550
we didn't feel it was
the way to go. We

188
00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:12.710
felt that if, if you
were kept busy, kept stimulated,

189
00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:17.690
that that would temper the
whole situation down a little

190
00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:21.740
bit. And so every effort
was made by your mother,

191
00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:25.310
primarily because she was the
main caregiver with me working

192
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:30.920
so much to keep you
occupied and stimulated busy. And

193
00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:34.100
then when you basically beat
her down, we said, okay,

194
00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:37.160
what are we going to
do now? You know? So

195
00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:40.100
no, you, you were in
daycare at a very early

196
00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:42.260
age back when it wasn't
fashionable to put kids in

197
00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.300
daycare when they were two
years old and you were

198
00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:48.020
reading when you were some
ridiculous age of three or

199
00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:50.240
something like that, you were
reading. And so it was

200
00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:52.730
like, we've got to keep
this guy busy and by

201
00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:58.180
great school, you, after you
destroyed two teachers, I think

202
00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:00.070
it was your third or
fourth grade teacher that you

203
00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:05.140
finally knew how to handle
you. And just said, you

204
00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:06.880
know, this is what we
need to do. This is

205
00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:10.120
a thought, what do you
think? And that's when computers

206
00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.390
came in. Well, I remember
that this was kind of

207
00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:14.400
back when the school districts
were a little more involved

208
00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.800
and I seem to remember
a, and this may be

209
00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:21.270
me remembering legend, but I
remember the principal, my teacher,

210
00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:25.560
and then possibly a superintendent
meeting involved in Pfizer to

211
00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:28.650
this, you know, somebody high
up who could say, we've

212
00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:33.450
got this $2,500, 2000, $3,000
or seven heck of a

213
00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:37.470
lot of money now, but
it's Yeah, they had one

214
00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:39.330
or two computers at the
school at the time of

215
00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:42.000
school at the whole school.
It was the school district

216
00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:45.060
was just starting to get
into computers. They were dealing

217
00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:52.020
with, I believe primarily Apple
at the time. And it

218
00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:54.030
was heavy. I remember that
it was big. It was

219
00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:56.850
heavy. That's why we used
to truck. So, so we

220
00:12:56.850 --> 00:12:58.830
worked a deal out where
we would take the truck,

221
00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:02.250
sneak the computer out, kind
of quote, unquote sneak. Cause

222
00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:04.500
we didn't want the other
kids to be jealous. It

223
00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:07.080
was one of these things
where we had to be

224
00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:10.860
subtle. We came in on
Friday afternoons, back the truck,

225
00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:13.320
up to the door and
two or three trips from

226
00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:15.930
the room into the back
of the truck, covered it

227
00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:18.030
with a tarp and went
home, you know? And that

228
00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:20.160
kept you busy over the
weekend. We had a computer

229
00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:26.190
that you were able to
play around with and you

230
00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:28.800
knew more about it than,
I mean, we just, I

231
00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:31.290
mean, 30 years later, give
me an idea. I didn't

232
00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:34.590
have a clue. I mean,
you know, I was cleaning

233
00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:37.050
up in my garage or
in my shop and you

234
00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:38.820
know, as long as you
were quiet, I was thrilled

235
00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.470
Down with me and have
me show you what I

236
00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:45.360
was doing. I'm sure you
probably did, but re refresh

237
00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:48.060
my memory. I know, like
you said, it was 30

238
00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:51.030
years ago. We used to
get books. Like I still

239
00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:54.000
have one of these books
that was called the it's

240
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.910
like a 1982. I'm looking
over my bookshelf here. That

241
00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:59.520
was a book full of
programs to type in, to

242
00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:04.200
simulate the Olympics. Oh, okay.
Text-based yeah. So I had

243
00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:06.510
to type the program in,
you know, kept your busy

244
00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:09.690
line, 10 print, welcome to
the Olympics line 20 print.

245
00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:12.450
And it would tell you
things like you do the

246
00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:15.330
long jump and it'd be
all you type in the

247
00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:17.070
angle and the speed. And
it would let you know

248
00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:20.040
how far you jumped. No,
no graphics at all. We're

249
00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:22.950
talking about basically, Right? This
was just basic. This was

250
00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:25.320
letters. If I remember on
a green screen, Exactly. The

251
00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:27.450
whole texts. I mean, it's
called the basic language. That

252
00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:29.610
was, Was that still on
that the one that we

253
00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:31.740
got from the school or
is this The one from

254
00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:35.340
the computer? Okay. And visual
basic, which you know about,

255
00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:36.660
cause you've seen it on
my blog a couple of

256
00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:38.700
times, that's the kind of
people are still using basic.

257
00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:41.130
It's just, it's different now.
But the, the, the, his,

258
00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:45.390
the history is there. And
then if I remember correctly,

259
00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:49.320
this was a success. Yeah.
It seemed to, well, you,

260
00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:53.120
you found a real, I
mean, and the teachers at

261
00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:56.000
school were saying, Hey, this,
whatever we were doing, we

262
00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.280
were doing it. Right. And
we were blessed with you.

263
00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:04.370
You are blessed. And we
all were with some great

264
00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:09.350
teachers at, at Glen Haven
school in Portland, Oregon. And

265
00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:14.870
there, there were just some
real special people who would

266
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:20.470
take you, you know, laterally
as well as vertically. Well,

267
00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:23.890
the teachers you remember came
to my wedding. Oh yeah.

268
00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:27.490
20 plus 25 years later.
Yeah. No, they were special

269
00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:29.470
people. And they, I mean,
they were a large part

270
00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:33.190
of our family and made,
certainly made our life easier.

271
00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:37.660
Are you implying? They were
my medication. Yeah. They were

272
00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:40.060
actually cheaper than the Ritalin
was at the time. The

273
00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:43.630
market value for Ritalin was
high then, but teachers, I

274
00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:45.550
mean, I was paying taxes
anyway, by God, we got

275
00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:48.430
our tax dollars out of
them. They were cool teachers.

276
00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:50.950
There is a time. In
fact, some people have One

277
00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:54.370
in their lifetime. You have
three great teachers. Yeah. Well,

278
00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:56.530
you had more than that
even. Yeah. But just off

279
00:15:56.530 --> 00:15:59.080
the, just thinking about first
through eighth grade, there were

280
00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:01.570
three people who we still
talk to now, one, one

281
00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:04.200
has passed away, but two,
we still are in communication.

282
00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:07.960
Yeah. No, it was, it
helped your mother and I

283
00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:11.320
beyond, you know, compare. And
then, then, you know, right

284
00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:16.960
behind you was your brother
who was equally curious, but

285
00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:19.150
a hundred percent different in
many respects, you know? And

286
00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:22.360
so we had to get
the two young boys less

287
00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:27.760
than two years apart. And
you know, like so many

288
00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:30.610
parents are both today and
back then, you know, first

289
00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:35.140
time parents, new parents have
a couple of handfuls that

290
00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:37.060
we're dealing. I mean, every
kid's a handful in their

291
00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:40.240
own way, Without a doubt,
you know? And so, yeah,

292
00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:42.280
we were, we were a
little stressed out, but it,

293
00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:47.080
it worked. And then they
said, well, you know, we're

294
00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:48.940
not going to be able
to, you need to get

295
00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:51.370
him his own computer. We
can't be doing this every

296
00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:54.160
Friday, Monday through Friday, you
know, he still needs to

297
00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:56.920
keep busy on, on the
evenings. Can you maybe get

298
00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:59.800
him a computer? And it
was like, okay, well how

299
00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:02.410
much is this going to
cost? Right, exactly. And cause

300
00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:04.030
like I said, I was
working two jobs. I think

301
00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:05.440
you were doing the oil
truck, you were driving your

302
00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:07.120
firemen and you're driving the
oil truck around. Yeah. We

303
00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:08.740
didn't have a lot of
money. You know, we made

304
00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:11.110
some life choices. We fed,
we ate every day though

305
00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:13.900
we ate every day, we
made some choices, life choices.

306
00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:19.960
And that involved me working
two jobs, which was fine,

307
00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:23.080
but it was like the
money was tight. So whatever

308
00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:25.270
we bought, we had to
make sure that it was

309
00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:28.180
going to work and your
mom investigated it, you know,

310
00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:32.080
just in depth as much
as she could then and

311
00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:35.140
made a lot of phone
calls and, and talked with

312
00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:37.840
you. Cause you, you were
cognizant of, you know, more

313
00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:40.150
things computer wise than she
was. And that we were,

314
00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:42.040
you know, I mean, when
she was working at the

315
00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:46.060
gas company, she was proficient
in a 10 key. That

316
00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:48.760
was for those of you
that don't know what the

317
00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.850
heck of key is. We
got that on the side

318
00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:52.800
of the that's yeah. That's
kind of like the side

319
00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:55.140
of your keyboard, but it's
manual and it's not digital

320
00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:58.200
anything. It was a, they
were spring loaded buttons. And

321
00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.640
then you had a lever
on the side that you

322
00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:02.730
pulled to tabulate it. So,
but she was good at

323
00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:08.100
it. And so she investigated
and came up with the

324
00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:12.300
idea of getting a Commodore
64 and it was like,

325
00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:14.100
then the next question was,
where's the money gonna come

326
00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:17.580
from? So we sold the
van, we ended up selling

327
00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:20.970
a van. We had an
old Ford van and we

328
00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:25.560
sold that, bought the Commodore.
And we figured, okay, if

329
00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:28.050
this doesn't work, at least
let's get something out of

330
00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:31.320
this in a positive development
for other people. So rather

331
00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:33.330
than to get it, quote,
monitor unquote, we got a

332
00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:37.290
television set, 13 inch TV,
16 inch TV set that

333
00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:39.830
It was our first color
TV at that point. Or

334
00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:42.860
have we, so then we
had, well, if this computer

335
00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:44.630
thing doesn't work out, we
can always use it as

336
00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:47.780
a TV. Is the truck,
wasn't a total waste. You

337
00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:49.820
know what I mean? Being
opened seriously as a nine

338
00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:51.380
or Darville when it was
nine or 10 years old,

339
00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:55.460
when that happened. I remember
the idea that this big

340
00:18:55.940 --> 00:19:00.860
blue mult, you know, multi
ton truck van is now

341
00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:06.500
gone replaced with this size
shoe box sized box. And

342
00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:09.500
I remember that Box was
replaced with another box There

343
00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:12.350
being some trepidation that trepidation,
but there was this kind

344
00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:14.880
of like On my part.
Yeah. You might have detected,

345
00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:18.770
I was going to say
buyer's remorse, but yeah, No,

346
00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:21.050
there was a little resentment.
This thing is a van.

347
00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:23.750
Yeah. I couldn't take the
computer hunting and fishing. I

348
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:25.370
couldn't sleep in the back
of it. You know? I

349
00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:28.010
mean when I was fishing,
so yeah, there was just

350
00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:30.440
a tad bit of resentment,
but it passed, you know,

351
00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:34.190
I think with your first
paycheck. So 20 short years

352
00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:37.070
later, you're already short I'm
over it. But that's an

353
00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:40.880
interesting thing though, because you
made a choice, a dramatic

354
00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:43.190
life choice. You got rid
of your car, the car

355
00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:45.140
you fished in. We had
another vehicle, but I mean,

356
00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:47.360
we got rid of one
of the vehicles in order

357
00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:49.550
to yeah. As a child,
even then I realized that

358
00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:51.800
this was a big deal.
This was the most valuable

359
00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:55.970
thing that we had in
the house Material wise. No,

360
00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:59.210
the two kids were the
most valuable thing we had

361
00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:04.670
in the house material wise,
Charlie, this was, you know,

362
00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:07.730
it's like 300 bucks. Oh
it's more than that. Was

363
00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:09.500
it big? It was, I
don't remember what the color

364
00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:11.030
was back in the day,
but it was a nontrivial

365
00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:12.620
and I don't remember what
the price was being honest,

366
00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:14.210
but it was, we went
to Sears and we bought

367
00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:16.610
this Commodore and then I
started typing in programs with

368
00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:20.240
graphics. And then we got
an interesting man. And then

369
00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:23.540
I remember this, remember when
I started the bulletin board,

370
00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:26.990
I was 14. And I
said, I'm going to start

371
00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:28.280
this bulletin board. I need
you to give me another

372
00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:32.630
phone line. And I said,
and you said, well, you're

373
00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:35.690
going to need to get
a job. I was 14.

374
00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:37.490
And when I went to
an org member that where

375
00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:39.110
you wouldn't pay for the
phone line, we're talking about

376
00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:41.360
a $40 a month phone
line. This was back when

377
00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:44.330
a hardware. Cause I was
living in the garage. I

378
00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:46.550
was living in the garage.
W we had moved from

379
00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:49.360
Portland up to Beaverton at
that Point. Then I lived

380
00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:51.370
behind the garage and a
little apartment behind the car,

381
00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:54.720
Like a mother-in-law apartment behind
the garage. And the house

382
00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:58.710
itself only had two bedrooms.
So your brother lived in

383
00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:00.120
one of the bed, you
know, I had one bedroom

384
00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:02.970
and that you were being
the eldest, get the privilege

385
00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:06.600
or the No, to be
sequestered back of the garage,

386
00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:08.130
Slate it in the back
of the garage where I

387
00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:11.460
can lock you back there
yet. Sure. So for me,

388
00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:13.230
I got it. So I
wanted a phone line cause

389
00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:16.320
I got this. So I
went and got a job

390
00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:19.200
as a stock boy at
Nordstrom's that's right. And that

391
00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:22.140
was, that was 14. And
then 15, I started a

392
00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:24.210
company. Remember you helped me
fill out the paperwork to

393
00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:26.460
get a corporation. Of course,
Operation through the state on

394
00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:29.040
that one. You've got it
licensed. Yeah. I was 15

395
00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:32.670
registered. Yeah. I did the
whole corporation division thing. And

396
00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:35.130
then I think at the
height had a couple of

397
00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:37.380
phone lines go in there
and I had people calling

398
00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:39.810
in on this. Yeah. Two
phone lines. Yeah. One was

399
00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:42.570
computer. One was phone. Yeah.
I ended up using them

400
00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:46.410
both actually For computers. Yeah.
So we had, at that

401
00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:48.180
point we had three phone
lines into the house. One

402
00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:50.760
to the house two to
you. Right? Exactly. So then

403
00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:55.350
I had people calling in
playing games over the phone.

404
00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:58.530
Was he being Slated where
you were? I didn't know

405
00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:00.690
a lot of this stuff
and it's probably best that

406
00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:02.880
I didn't, you know? Well,
I don't even know whether

407
00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:05.670
your mom knew about, We
should probably make sure she

408
00:22:05.670 --> 00:22:08.550
doesn't listen to the podcast.
But what was cool about

409
00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:11.400
this is that I thought
you were really, you guys

410
00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:13.170
were really good about enabling
me to do this stuff,

411
00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:17.640
but not in the writing
a check, Hey kid, here's

412
00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:19.470
some money, go do your
thing. When I said I

413
00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:22.350
wanted a phone line, you
said, how are you going

414
00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:25.230
to pay for that? And
when I wanted a computer,

415
00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:29.040
I think I bought a
46. You took me down

416
00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:31.770
to a little computer shop
in downtown Portland. And it

417
00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:34.530
was $2,000. Remember that I'm
afraid this guy's name I'd

418
00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:37.350
forgotten and we needed to
pay for it. And at

419
00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:40.560
this point I've got a
little corporation. So you went

420
00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:43.020
and co-signed and I thought
this was so cool. My

421
00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:49.290
friends thought this was cool.
It was $15,000 loan for

422
00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:52.800
tutoring. Your name's my name
though. So I was building

423
00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:55.800
credit for the corporation and
it was also deduction. And

424
00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:58.950
this is cool because I'd
forgotten about that. Speaking of

425
00:22:58.950 --> 00:23:00.900
things, you didn't forget, you
forgot about one of the

426
00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:03.360
coolest things you ever did
was after I got the

427
00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:06.150
corporation, I started doing the
business, started doing my own

428
00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:09.480
taxes. 15. I got up.
Did you ever save me

429
00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:15.330
any money? Doing taxes? Probably
not. I got an American

430
00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:19.920
express card, corporate card and
I dropped it at school.

431
00:23:21.030 --> 00:23:23.790
And the principal found it.
Remember that? Yeah. I'm trying

432
00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:28.500
to remember the principal found
it and called you and

433
00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:30.600
started to kind of read
you the riot act. Like

434
00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:32.670
how does this boy have
a corporate card for American

435
00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:34.960
express? And he children this
age shouldn't have credit cards

436
00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:38.220
that you didn't know. I
had the card because I'm

437
00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:39.900
15. At this point, I'm
not supposed to have a

438
00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:43.410
credit card until I'm 18.
I think someone may have

439
00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:46.400
accidentally put the wrong birthday
on. Do you think on

440
00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:49.700
an application and then what
was so cool was that

441
00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:52.160
you were called to the
principal's office. You came into

442
00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:54.080
school. Was it me? Or
was it your mom? Was

443
00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:57.980
you? Because I remember because
you said you hadn't, this

444
00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:00.800
was the first year learning
of this and you said,

445
00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:04.370
my son manages his money
better than I do. And

446
00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:06.350
I backed him up a
hundred percent for having this

447
00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:10.370
car and you completely shut
her down. And then afterwards

448
00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:14.300
you said, you little, what
are you doing with this

449
00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:16.370
fricking card? I want you
to cut this thing, but

450
00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:19.550
you backed me up in
front of the principal. I

451
00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:22.040
forgot. I'd forgotten about that.
Yeah, but it was cool

452
00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:25.320
because you didn't, the business
was getting bigger than you

453
00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:27.710
had expected when you weren't
making a bunch of money,

454
00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:32.170
you know, 15 years old,
15 year old. Alright. I

455
00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:33.880
guess, you know, I don't
know how much did you

456
00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:36.280
make back yet? I was
15. I was pulling down

457
00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:40.570
15 grand a year as
it was, Are near Morton.

458
00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:42.220
I was making as a
firefighter. So that's why I

459
00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:44.890
had to work two jobs.
But that money, that was

460
00:24:44.890 --> 00:24:46.480
a big deal at the
time. And that allowed me

461
00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:49.070
to buy, you know, buy
a car and you know,

462
00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:51.910
and put money down for
our house when we were

463
00:24:51.910 --> 00:24:53.740
older. Yeah. A couple of
years later I was thinking

464
00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:56.560
about that kind of stuff.
But those kinds of things,

465
00:24:56.560 --> 00:25:00.580
when you were backing me
up on things like I

466
00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:02.260
wanted to buy a car
and you said, well, I'll,

467
00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:03.880
I'll help you maintain it.
I'll teach you how to

468
00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:06.550
change the oil, but I'm
not gonna give you the

469
00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:09.490
money for it. Yeah. You
put, you enabled us in

470
00:25:09.490 --> 00:25:13.180
other ways. So speaking of
enabling us with both John

471
00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:16.090
called an enabler before. Yeah.
In the best possible way.

472
00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:17.950
One of the things that
you did with both Josh

473
00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:20.050
and I was that you're
so good with your hands.

474
00:25:20.050 --> 00:25:22.930
You're always building stuff. You
encouraged us to take things

475
00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:26.440
apart And you did a
few things over the years.

476
00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:29.530
I remember. Yeah. I remember
taking apart a clock radio.

477
00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:33.100
You still have a drill
that a quarter. How did

478
00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:35.500
I get that drill? Cause
I couldn't fix the damn

479
00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:38.290
thing for a darn thing.
Right. I couldn't fix it.

480
00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:42.010
I think it was broken.
I had a drill that

481
00:25:42.010 --> 00:25:43.990
was broken. I tried to
fix it or mess with

482
00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:46.120
it and I thought, ah,
the heck with it. And

483
00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:48.820
I said, here's Scott, you
know? And I think you

484
00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:52.210
still have it now. Probably
15. 20. Yeah. You said

485
00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:55.450
what? I don't remember whether
I can repeat what he

486
00:25:55.450 --> 00:25:58.390
said. You said, if you
want this drill, you can

487
00:25:58.390 --> 00:26:00.310
have it, but you have
to fix it. Oh, okay.

488
00:26:00.370 --> 00:26:04.720
Alright. So then I took
it apart and rewired the

489
00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:07.930
pistol, the push button, put
it back together and it

490
00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:10.180
worked. You couldn't believe it
because you'd been working on

491
00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:11.800
it for a couple of
days on and off trying

492
00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:13.110
to get this thing to
work. And I just figured

493
00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:15.700
it, toss it. And then
I got to keep the

494
00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:17.500
drill. It was a nice
drill at the time. It

495
00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:19.870
was a good old Sears
craftsman. You know, I still

496
00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:22.110
have that drill at work.
That's in the garage. Is

497
00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:24.220
it unused? Since in the
last 20 years, I haven't

498
00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:28.030
turned it off it off
Because I'm not known for

499
00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:30.970
being handy. Well, but no
you're handy in your, in

500
00:26:30.970 --> 00:26:34.810
your, In your field, in,
you know, in your area

501
00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:38.470
of expertise, you know, your
brother can take a bicycle

502
00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:41.830
apart, you know, blindfolded and
you know, it can do

503
00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:45.270
as firefighter thing. And when
it comes to computers and

504
00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:49.140
software and programming and you
know, so far, I never

505
00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:51.420
thought it would happen that
way though. Well, you know,

506
00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:53.370
and I didn't know what
was going to happen. I

507
00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:55.890
mean, and as a parent
and I, I know I

508
00:26:55.890 --> 00:26:58.350
can speak for your mother
on this too. I mean

509
00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:02.880
your biggest fear or your
biggest, your biggest want for

510
00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:06.000
your children is for them
to be one, to be

511
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.450
healthy, to, to be productive
and not in jail, you

512
00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:11.700
know, not doing drugs and
not in jail, not on

513
00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:15.000
the Dole and both you
and your brother have, you

514
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.140
know, made your mother. And
I very, very proud of

515
00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:20.910
you exceeded your expectations and
optical. You're not a drag

516
00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:23.370
on me. You know, it's
probably the reverse is true

517
00:27:23.370 --> 00:27:26.040
more than anything else, you
know? No, we're all very

518
00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:29.670
fortunate. We are blessed that
we've done as well as

519
00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:31.830
we've done. And you know,
yeah, we're not rich, but

520
00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:35.970
your mother and I are
retired now and enjoying grandchildren

521
00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:39.600
and you know, your two
lovely boys and Josh was

522
00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:41.760
lovely little grant. Do you
feel looking back on that?

523
00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:45.900
I remember it's bizarre. Totally
bizarre. Do you remember the

524
00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:49.530
time when you said it
at one of my precocious

525
00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:53.310
peaks, I love you that
you said I love you

526
00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:55.950
dearly, but right now I
don't like you very much.

527
00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:58.980
Yeah. Well, you made that
nut podcast, the last podcast

528
00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:01.710
or the last post, their
last blog post that you

529
00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:03.480
put in there. You mentioned
that I saw that too.

530
00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:05.220
Yeah. I was thinking about
it. Just, I do read

531
00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:08.190
what you write once I
read your blog when it's

532
00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:12.600
in English, but I don't
want to say when it's

533
00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:14.700
in computer is I don't
read it. I do a

534
00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:17.220
quick scan. I say, dude,
that's beyond my scope in

535
00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:20.370
C sharp C sharp. And
I'm a flat man. So

536
00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:23.160
I mean, yeah, I'm a
C from the old school.

537
00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:26.010
I mean, I do my
email. I do, you know,

538
00:28:26.050 --> 00:28:30.060
I searched the web for,
you know, bow and arrow

539
00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:34.980
sites and traditional archery sites
and fishing sites and check

540
00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:37.530
my CNN and my Reuters
news and call me when

541
00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:39.420
it doesn't work. And yeah,
when the thing's broken and

542
00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:42.540
I say, come fix this,
you a little cred. You

543
00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:44.820
know what I mean? It's,
that's, that's how you keep

544
00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:47.850
grandpa happy and then I'll
come and, you know, build

545
00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:51.490
your work venture or punch
a hole in your wall

546
00:28:51.490 --> 00:28:54.480
and patch it up for
you. It's trade offs. That's

547
00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:57.870
what life is all about.
We make trade offs with

548
00:28:57.870 --> 00:29:00.060
you guys as kids. You're
going to be making trade

549
00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:03.090
offs with your kids in
the future. I remember trying

550
00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:06.600
to get college figured out
was the tough one. That

551
00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:08.310
was tough. How are we
going to pay for college?

552
00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:11.130
And I ended up visiting
colleges, but I couldn't figure

553
00:29:11.130 --> 00:29:13.530
out how to pay for
it. So we ended up

554
00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:16.530
going to community college. And
you remember that took quite

555
00:29:16.530 --> 00:29:19.050
a few years for me
to finish my, my degree

556
00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:21.180
when you were working and
going to school, is that

557
00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:24.660
important? I mean, I mean,
I didn't graduate until if

558
00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:28.080
you remember you, when you
dropped out of school to

559
00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:29.990
be clear, you didn't make
it to high school. No,

560
00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:32.250
I didn't know. You took
out of college though. I

561
00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:35.850
was asked to leave one
college and then I chose

562
00:29:35.850 --> 00:29:39.330
to leave one or two
others. I mean, I, I've

563
00:29:39.330 --> 00:29:41.800
got, I think three years
as far as credits. I

564
00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:44.500
think I've got three somewhere
in my junior year, but

565
00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:48.280
then I had, you know,
just a multitude of training

566
00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:51.310
episodes with the fire department
over the years. And then

567
00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:55.180
the equivalent of on top
of that when I was

568
00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:58.960
in my late forties, I
went through paramedic school, which

569
00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:02.680
equates now to an associate's
degree. So you have associates?

570
00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:04.300
Well, I mean, I have,
I have a pair of,

571
00:30:04.390 --> 00:30:07.480
I was a paramedic. I
was, you know, the fact

572
00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:10.090
that I have a quote
associates back in the seventies

573
00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:12.190
when I was going to
school, they didn't have, you

574
00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:15.580
know, you had junior colleges
or credit community colleges, but

575
00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:18.310
I don't even think they
had degrees that they were

576
00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:20.290
issuing for some of the
stuff that I was taking.

577
00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:23.820
You know, I was taking
anthropology. And Was that important?

578
00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:25.800
I mean, I remember you
guys were, you guys were

579
00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:28.140
even for you teaching Josh
and I, you were like,

580
00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:29.910
well, we'd like you to
go to college. You know,

581
00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:32.760
we hadn't gone. You guys
didn't go to college until

582
00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:35.100
mom went later in life.
I went later in life

583
00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:37.770
and got her master's degree
at 60. I mean, that's

584
00:30:37.770 --> 00:30:41.010
six phenomenal, you know, But
growing up, I don't remember

585
00:30:41.010 --> 00:30:43.140
a lot of pressure. You
guys were mostly pressuring us

586
00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:45.720
to be happy, To be
happy. Do you know, do

587
00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:47.940
what makes you feed your
spirit? That was the main

588
00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:49.710
thing, you know, be a
good person, be a good

589
00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:52.230
human being, treat people the
way you want to be

590
00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:54.330
treated. If you go, you
know, we would like you

591
00:30:54.330 --> 00:30:56.760
to go to school. Yeah.
The whole time we were

592
00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:59.880
encouraging you to go to
school, you know, to your

593
00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:02.370
face, then your mother. And
I would say, how in

594
00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:04.290
the heavens are we going
to pay for this? You

595
00:31:04.290 --> 00:31:07.830
know? Well, and we took
a second mortgage on the

596
00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:11.400
house. It was like, okay,
we'll pay for half. You

597
00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:14.640
pay for half. We'll help
you out. You know, with

598
00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:17.250
tuition, you pay room and
board or whatever, same deal.

599
00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:20.040
Joshua went on a five
year plan to Oregon. Cause

600
00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:22.860
he changed his major. His
junior year. That's fine. You

601
00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:25.740
know, he paid for, you
know, he had X number

602
00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:27.900
of dollars to, to make
it stretch. And if he

603
00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:30.180
could stretch it for five
or six, whatever it took

604
00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:33.660
and the same offer was
to you, you were scheduled

605
00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:35.500
to go to Oregon. You
were all ready to go

606
00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:39.300
ahead and accepted. Yeah. You'd
been accepted to Oregon. And

607
00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:42.990
like in July you said,
yeah, I just don't think

608
00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:45.090
I want to do this.
It was a mess. I

609
00:31:45.090 --> 00:31:46.770
don't know whatever. And I
do, I did that whole

610
00:31:46.770 --> 00:31:49.980
trip back East and I
visited Boston college and I,

611
00:31:50.030 --> 00:31:53.760
I had forgotten it at
MIT. I'd forgotten. I just

612
00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:55.920
wasn't ready to go to
school. I think now at

613
00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:58.980
34, I'm mentally prepared to
attend college. Well, yeah, but

614
00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:01.260
now you're teaching college periodically.
I know. So I mean,

615
00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:04.020
that's, you know, you know,
you've, you've done well, you

616
00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:07.560
know, you got your, you
got, you finally working, continuing,

617
00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:09.420
working and going to school
at night. You got your

618
00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:13.500
bachelor's through, was it OIT
or institution Whitey. I was

619
00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:15.430
working at night. That was
a good deal. Yeah. And

620
00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:17.820
then it turned around and
the night of the graduation,

621
00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:21.810
they introduced you as a,
as a what's the word?

622
00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:26.040
Adjunct. Adjunct. Yeah. As like
part time, not tenured. Yeah.

623
00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:28.220
No pay or minimal pay
and you know, but still

624
00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:30.180
it was fun. I love
teaching. You can graduate and

625
00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:32.730
become an adjunct professor, you
know, the same day. I

626
00:32:32.730 --> 00:32:35.400
mean, that's, that was cool.
You know, it was a

627
00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:38.160
good day. Maybe someday you'll
teach again. If that's what,

628
00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:39.800
you know, feed your spirit.
That's what I do now.

629
00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:42.440
I mean, I would argue
that that's who I am

630
00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:46.940
the teacher, I would say.
Yeah. I would say that.

631
00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:48.880
I mean, in everything I
do, I'm a, I'm a

632
00:32:48.890 --> 00:32:51.770
teacher teacher and in the
lightener well, in the lightener

633
00:32:51.770 --> 00:32:53.640
implies, I have the answers
and I don't have any,

634
00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:57.380
you know, you're, you're presenting
options. Ooh, I like that.

635
00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:00.560
You know, isn't that enlightening,
I'm an option. Enlightening isn't

636
00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:02.660
necessarily giving the answer. It's
just giving one of many

637
00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:05.450
options as the way I
see maybe my definitions to

638
00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:08.390
enlighten implies that there's darkness
without me. And I would

639
00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:11.420
say, Hey, need me to
say more? No, I'm just

640
00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:14.360
saying that. I just let
there be light. I thank

641
00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:18.950
you. I'm saying that. I
really like when, when I

642
00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:22.190
feel like I've got a
perspective on something, not necessarily

643
00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:24.530
all the answers, but a
perspective. And I like to

644
00:33:24.530 --> 00:33:28.040
swap perspectives with people, such
that they go, Oh, I

645
00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:30.080
didn't think about it that
way. And I am, and

646
00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:32.720
I get their perspective. I
see your mother calls up

647
00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:35.780
to me. She says, you
I'm playing devil's advocate all

648
00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:37.760
the time. You know? And
that's just a, a more

649
00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:40.670
basic version of the same
thing. Maybe people, people, right.

650
00:33:40.670 --> 00:33:43.790
We like, we like Shaq,
BSN shooting the BS. Yeah,

651
00:33:43.790 --> 00:33:46.550
exactly. I mean, that's fun.
That's who we are as

652
00:33:47.390 --> 00:33:49.490
young as we're, as long
as we are kind to

653
00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:53.630
people. And as long as
people realize that we're not

654
00:33:53.630 --> 00:33:57.650
malicious, the intent is not
malicious. It's always a for

655
00:33:57.650 --> 00:34:02.120
enlightening purposes or presenting options.
However, you know, then that's,

656
00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:04.640
that's the challenge though. I
mean, to, to present things

657
00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:06.740
to people in such a
way that you say, you

658
00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:09.620
know, here's another thing, if
you like it, I wish

659
00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:12.170
you all the best. And
if not, you know, because

660
00:34:12.170 --> 00:34:14.360
you make a mistake. Yeah.
You know? Okay. That's your

661
00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:18.500
loss. Yeah, no, no. It's
really, it is important. You

662
00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:20.360
know, that's how I was
taught though. I mean, back

663
00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:23.570
to those three people who
was three teachers, they were

664
00:34:23.570 --> 00:34:27.020
very welcoming. They were welcoming
us, the students into the

665
00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:29.120
knowledge. It was like, Hey,
you guys check this out.

666
00:34:30.350 --> 00:34:33.080
Maybe this will be something
you'll enjoy. Look at it

667
00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:35.390
from this angle, Scott, you'll
look at it from this

668
00:34:35.390 --> 00:34:39.890
angle. Yeah. Another Josh, Josh.
And they would encourage every

669
00:34:39.890 --> 00:34:43.480
one of them. And that
was what really pro basketball

670
00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:46.370
was that mrs. Probasco and
she married actually the eighth

671
00:34:46.370 --> 00:34:49.070
grade English teacher married the
seventh grade math teacher. Right.

672
00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:50.870
And they, they got married
and they ended up coming

673
00:34:50.870 --> 00:34:53.000
to the wedding. Yeah. And
then my fifth grade teacher

674
00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.160
who gave me the computer
and they were special people,

675
00:34:55.190 --> 00:35:00.050
they came to the yeah.
Excellent, excellent teachers, great educators.

676
00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:03.140
And that's what, well, I
want to do that. I

677
00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:05.240
mean, I want to, when
I retire, I'll go teach

678
00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:08.540
school. Well, and like you
say, you're educating, you know,

679
00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:11.000
in a sense of your
understanding. And that's what my

680
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.380
job is. I think I
read it somewhere, but I

681
00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:19.130
mean, repeat, you know, no,
I'm just curious. Sometimes one

682
00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:20.390
of the things that a
lot of the listeners have

683
00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:23.150
said that like explaining to
their parents what they do,

684
00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:25.850
like what it means to
be a programmer. Yeah. Is

685
00:35:25.850 --> 00:35:28.190
kind of a tough thing
because I mean, if I

686
00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:31.310
were building a bridge that
would make sense. Yeah. You're

687
00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:33.290
building a bridge and then
you look at it 20

688
00:35:33.290 --> 00:35:35.900
years later and there's this
bridge. Isn't that cool. But

689
00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:38.490
with us, I could write
amazing. And I could show

690
00:35:38.490 --> 00:35:40.050
you today and you could
say, Hey, you made that

691
00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:43.230
cool. Like, like, remember gluco
pilot. I wrote that blood

692
00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:48.780
sugar program. You a Palm
pilot just handed me down.

693
00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:54.660
I'm still using a nice,
Hey, very nice pawn and

694
00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:57.780
accused. It's not an antique.
It's a nice, nice regional

695
00:35:57.780 --> 00:35:59.700
Palm pilot. And I use
it actually. I use it

696
00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:02.610
almost, not every day, but
I check it at least

697
00:36:02.610 --> 00:36:04.380
a couple times a week
to see whose birthday I

698
00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:07.260
missed. There you go. So
you know how, by the

699
00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:12.540
way, happy birthday yesterday, only
a day late. I appreciate

700
00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:17.010
that. But you, you know
that, like that to conceive

701
00:36:17.010 --> 00:36:19.650
you basically to conceive of
an idea from scratch, I

702
00:36:19.650 --> 00:36:21.750
sat down and I said,
wouldn't it be cool if

703
00:36:22.350 --> 00:36:25.160
which is what you do
with wood, which I tried

704
00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:28.020
to do with you may
succeeded. I'm yet to succeed,

705
00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:31.680
except with Isabel's a crib.
It's the same thing though.

706
00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:34.620
You make a, you make,
have a concept in your

707
00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:38.430
mind, you visualize you plan.
And then you construct the

708
00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:41.610
only differences that the chair
and the table you made

709
00:36:41.610 --> 00:36:44.850
for my son will be
around next year. Well, my

710
00:36:44.850 --> 00:36:47.700
software will be upgraded by
someone else. It didn't. I,

711
00:36:47.710 --> 00:36:49.800
if I remember right, you
asked me to make a

712
00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:52.920
second chair for your, yeah.
You haven't made yours is

713
00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:55.800
being upgraded. My work's being
upgraded continually. Also. I would

714
00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:57.780
like to see chair 2.0
some time to be a

715
00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:01.110
third, no more children. No
more children. We're done. Thank

716
00:37:01.110 --> 00:37:03.810
you. So just one more
chair, two boys. Any one

717
00:37:03.810 --> 00:37:06.090
more chair. Okay. I'll work
on that. Then you're done.

718
00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:09.330
And you can rest. Oh,
no. I can just wait

719
00:37:09.330 --> 00:37:12.600
for the next request. Well,
dad, I really appreciate you

720
00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:15.360
coming in having a podcast
with me and hanging out

721
00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:18.090
today and for raising you
for everything that you do,

722
00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:21.480
as I've said many, many
times before. Thank you. And

723
00:37:22.530 --> 00:37:24.930
this has been another episode
of Hanselminutes and we'll see

724
00:37:24.930 --> 00:37:25.560
you again next week.
