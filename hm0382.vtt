symbol calculator that gives you
instant answers as you type.

10
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.850
Hi, this is Scott Hanselman.
This is another episode of

11
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.790
Hansel minutes. And on the
phone I've got Frank Krueger

12
00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:09.380
who just wrote an application
called Kalka a symbolic calculator

13
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.460
for a iPad and it
appears to be blowing up.

14
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.500
Congratulations, Frank. Thank you, Scott.
Yeah, it's been out for

15
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.920
just four weeks and it's
surpassed my expectations. Thank you.

16
00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.650
That's amazing. You, you got
fireball fireball when John Uber

17
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.240
runs during fireball likes you
apparently. Yeah, and I got

18
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.840
fireballs while on an airplane,
so it was quite fantastic

19
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.840
when I landed my phone
was just full of messages

20
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.410
and my friends yelling, laughing
at me, all sorts of

21
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.320
things. It was quite exciting.
And this is a big

22
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.260
deal. I mean, did your,
did your site go down

23
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.780
as fireball, like the modern
slash dotting or did anything

24
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.700
tip over break or did
you just like get a

25
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.430
bunch of money? I don't
think there are a host

26
00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.740
of years, but I use
Squarespace and I've heard that

27
00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.860
they automatically adapt to that
kind of stuff. I don't

28
00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.100
think the site went down,
definitely posted more traffic than

29
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.880
I've ever gotten before. I
definitely had the best sales

30
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.900
day I've ever had before.
Yeah, it was just a

31
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:18.980
great day. So daring, well
during fireballs is especially important

32
00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.980
to me because I did
write this application with the

33
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.400
Mac community in mind. And
so it's just been really

34
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.210
gratifying that they've caught on
and seen the app. So

35
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.050
I'm quite proud of that
fact. So it is a

36
00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.760
kind of a reimagining of
the calculator. It's, it's a

37
00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.450
text editor, it's a math
environment. It's a solver, it's

38
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.780
a spreadsheet. I mean, is
that, those are all kinds

39
00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.960
of words for things that
we understand to describe something

40
00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.530
new. Yeah. And that, that
was the problem I had

41
00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.500
when I was originally trying
to write its description. I

42
00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.070
was just comparing it against
a million other applications because

43
00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.880
it is, it's a conglomeration
of what were desperate apps

44
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.400
and to just one thing.
So yeah, it started as

45
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.010
a text editor because I'm
a programmer and I spend

46
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.860
my life inside of texts,
editors, and I'm very comfortable

47
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.570
in there, but I just
wanted a more, I wanted

48
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.390
a text editor with all
the freedom of like sublime

49
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.540
text, but I wanted some
of the features of IDs

50
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.230
because our IDs are really
powerful these days. And then

51
00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.960
I wanted a math engine,
simple as that. I was

52
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.010
getting tired of using Google
and well from alpha. And

53
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.990
so I thought, well, what
would happen if you just

54
00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.950
combined all of these into
one app and Kalka is

55
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.110
what happened? I'm not a
math person. So I'll just

56
00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.180
have to plead ignorance right
off the bat, but is

57
00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.970
what is Mathematica and how
does it relate to things

58
00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.620
like that? Because isn't Mathematica
the math environment for all.

59
00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.610
I would say it's the
premiere math environment for all.

60
00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.240
It's a fantastic piece of
software. I think developed for

61
00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.960
all of eternity. I think
it's ageless at this point.

62
00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.520
It's, it's what all the
professional and academics use when

63
00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.190
they're doing hard computations. Do
you, do you have some

64
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.460
large integral that you want
to actually get a numerical

65
00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.430
value or sorry, not a
numerical value, but you actually

66
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.190
want to solve an integral,
find a close form solution

67
00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.060
for it. It, it, it
handles tremendous amounts of things

68
00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.320
all around the mathematics community.
Sometimes though it's a little

69
00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:34.860
frustrating to more engineering types
like myself, because it's very

70
00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.620
literal. If you ask it
to take the derivative of

71
00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.570
an impulse function, it'll give
you some funny, funny answers,

72
00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.390
things that you don't even
learn in engineering school, because

73
00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:49.380
it's such a smart, intelligent
math program. So I wanted

74
00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.580
some features from it, definitely
like the ability to solve

75
00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.940
algebraic equations, that kind of
thing. But I did not

76
00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.600
need all the other power
of Mathematica and I couldn't

77
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.490
afford all the other power
of Mathematica. I love that

78
00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.490
you, you couldn't afford all
of the pay for mathematics

79
00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.030
as you wrote your own.
I mean, that's Yeah. I

80
00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.330
mean, we're programmers, right? What
else do you do? No

81
00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.260
big deal. I have to
say though, I think that

82
00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.080
you're better at math than
maybe you give yourself credit

83
00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.870
for. I was looking at
a discussion of your tool

84
00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.290
via of blog here, and
I believe this was a

85
00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:32.430
quote from you where you
say one day it came

86
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.560
time for me to write
that Jacobian of a system

87
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.320
of six functions, each wall
involving the quaternary and of

88
00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.960
six different variables. And at
that point, my brain exploded.

89
00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.130
You know, I remember writing
that sentence and being like,

90
00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.430
Oh, I must sound like
such a jerk, but that

91
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.760
was, that was literally what
I was doing because I'm,

92
00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.580
well, let me break it
down since you don't, since

93
00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.380
you don't know these words,
cause they're actually very simple

94
00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:59.210
words. A quaternions is, it's
like a complex number, but

95
00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.440
it's, it's three-dimensional complex number.
So all the complex numbers

96
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.230
we normally deal with are
actually one dimensional. This is

97
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:09.530
a three dimensional complex number
and we use it to

98
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:13.580
represent rotations. And so what
I was saying there was,

99
00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:18.290
I needed a way to
represent my orientation, my rotation

100
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:21.380
in a math program. And
I used big words for

101
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:26.030
that. It's it's, it's actually
real simple. I was working

102
00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:30.830
on an augmented reality visualizer
kind of thing, and I

103
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:34.700
needed to align the camera,
my virtual camera with the

104
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.280
real camera and to do
that, I needed a Jacoby

105
00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:42.610
in of quaternions. That's pretty
awesome. I guess the limits

106
00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.620
of my math ability, there
would be you would want

107
00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:49.390
like a vector in three
dimensional space. That would be

108
00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:54.970
good. The problem with using
vectors is that imagine, imagine

109
00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:57.610
your normal game camera. So
we're playing a video game

110
00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:59.680
and we have a camera.
So it has a position

111
00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.830
in space and it has
an orientation. So that's six

112
00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:06.550
degrees of freedom. Now, when
you use vectors to represent

113
00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:10.180
three dimensional information, you, you
generally use four vectors, so

114
00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:15.100
12 values. So you have
three, Oh, sorry, six extra

115
00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:19.090
pieces, six extra degrees of
freedom. That really cause you

116
00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:20.890
troubles. When you're trying to
do the kind of work

117
00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:23.230
I'm doing. So I needed
a more refined way to

118
00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:28.030
represent 3d information and quaternions
provide that. I see. So

119
00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.180
Did I just be around
a bunch of vectors and

120
00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:34.660
then consider them all related
to each other? Just because

121
00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:37.300
I decided that they're related,
but at Jacobian matrix is

122
00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:41.680
exactly what this is needed.
What's needed for this. Yeah.

123
00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.500
It it's, it's more like
you don't want to over

124
00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.410
specify the problem. You don't
want to. Over-engineer the problem

125
00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:49.600
you want. You want to
have the unknowns that are

126
00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.540
really unknown and everything else
is known. You carry around

127
00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:55.690
this baggage in your head
knowing that the direction right.

128
00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:58.810
Is different from the direction
up. But the computer doesn't

129
00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:00.490
know that you have to
tell it right. And up

130
00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:04.060
are different and that's extra
information. That's a constraint on

131
00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:08.290
the degrees of freedom. Okay.
So coming back down to

132
00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:11.880
community college math, I'm so
sorry that that was no,

133
00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:14.380
no, I think this is
awesome. I, it makes me

134
00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:16.210
when I retire, I'm going
to go back to math

135
00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:21.430
class, but looking at the
website at Calca <inaudible> dot

136
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:24.490
IO, you use an example
that would make more sense.

137
00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:28.210
I think, to the average
Joe, where you have like

138
00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:31.780
a fixed rate mortgage and
it looks like you're writing

139
00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:36.220
Mark down here. Yeah. Yeah.
We forgot to throw that

140
00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:38.080
in and into our kitchen
sink of what this thing

141
00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:42.280
does. Yeah. So I, when,
when I was writing calc,

142
00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:44.920
I was obviously doing calculations
in it, but I found

143
00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:46.960
that I was writing a
lot of notes to myself

144
00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:50.950
in programming. We would just
leave comments or something. And

145
00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:53.530
I thought, well, I'm in
a text editor and Mark Downs

146
00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:57.540
really popular. What would happen
if I mixed a text

147
00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:03.630
editing annotations with calculations and
there there's a little pre

148
00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:09.270
prior work in this regard,
canoe, Donald Knuth, he, he

149
00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:13.560
invented a style programming called
literate programming. Have you seen

150
00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:18.540
that before Scott? It's, it's
really neat where you actually

151
00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:24.480
integrate. I'm not going to
do it justice, but it's

152
00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:31.200
a literate as an descriptive
description of your program. So

153
00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.910
you don't have just your
code. You have all the

154
00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:36.840
annotations either. I suggest people
go look up literate programming

155
00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:39.530
to see what it is.
Right. Well, but he knew

156
00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:41.900
thought that it would be
a way to express a

157
00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:46.910
program where the logic of
the program and English and

158
00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:51.050
macros and comments would all
be part of a larger,

159
00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:55.100
a larger program. So you'd
think about you'd think and

160
00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:56.990
the program would come out
of the way you thought.

161
00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:02.150
Yeah, there'd be ordinary human
language. And the program would

162
00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:06.200
be part of the overall
essay. Yeah. And it was

163
00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:09.590
an overall narration. So he
would change the order of

164
00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:13.700
a program to make the
narrative better, the description of

165
00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:17.960
the program better. And then
his program would, his stuff

166
00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:22.220
would compile his documents and
rearrange the program so that

167
00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:25.190
the compiler would be happy.
So he wrote the programs

168
00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:27.620
from a human perspective and
then wrote a tool to

169
00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:31.190
make the compiler happy. Right.
Right. Which is interesting because

170
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:33.380
if we look at your
example with the fixed rate

171
00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:38.330
mortgage on your homepage, this
looks like a word document,

172
00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:40.580
but it also looks like
a word document with an

173
00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:44.780
embedded spreadsheet. So then think
about the skills that would

174
00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:48.230
be required for, you know,
my mom or my dad

175
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:51.530
to sit down and ask
themselves this question, which is

176
00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:55.850
easy to ask the question,
but then combined word and

177
00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:59.270
Excel, and Lord knows what
else into some kind of

178
00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:03.740
larger report and then express
that that's a lot of

179
00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:06.770
concepts just to go and
figure out something like a

180
00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:10.700
mortgage, which makes you realize
it. They want to start

181
00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:14.480
writing on paper at this
point. And I've definitely had

182
00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:18.050
requests for just a much
larger standard library because yeah,

183
00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:20.840
some people just want to
calculate this stupid mortgage or

184
00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:23.030
the standard deviation or something
like that. They don't want

185
00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:28.760
to have to define the
standard deviation. Yeah. And honestly,

186
00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:32.690
so that's a constant struggle
I'm having of balancing the

187
00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:35.570
two of having something powerful
enough where you can define

188
00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:38.780
your own operations, but I
still provide you enough baked

189
00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:42.020
in baked in support. I
mean, this even goes back

190
00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:46.850
to us talking about that
earlier success of the application.

191
00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:49.310
I remember going to breakfast
with a bunch of friends

192
00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:55.360
before it's released and being
miserable. Essentially. I had convinced

193
00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.310
myself that no one was
going to like this application

194
00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:00.010
because I had realized this
fundamental mistake I made with

195
00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:03.340
it, where I was asking
so much of people. So

196
00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:07.480
I'm asking you to define
calculations, perform calculations, annotate your

197
00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:11.890
document. I'm asking so much
that I'd basically given up

198
00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:15.790
hope, but anyone would, would
tolerate all that kind of

199
00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:19.360
work. But it turns out
I was kind of wrong

200
00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:23.530
and we are living in
a very technically literate society

201
00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.740
right now. People are very
uncomfortable on the web. We

202
00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:28.690
have more programmers than I
think we know what to

203
00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:31.900
do with. And so I
think just in general, the

204
00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:34.390
technical literacy of people is
going up and they're able

205
00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:38.280
to tolerate more programs Like
this, especially thanks to Excel.

206
00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:42.040
So let's walk through it.
I sit down and I

207
00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:46.170
run Calca and then what?
Well, unfortunately right now you're

208
00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:48.960
given a blank document, just
like any good text editor.

209
00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:53.250
My, my favorite example is
you type two plus two.

210
00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:56.430
And then this funny symbol
that I, I would say

211
00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:58.620
I invented, but I think
you already named it. You

212
00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:01.470
call it the Anders symbol
Or a rocket ship. I

213
00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:04.020
think some people call it,
Oh, Rocky Chip. Yeah. I've

214
00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:08.970
heard other descriptions of it
too. I it's the equal

215
00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:12.150
sign followed by the greater
sign. I call it therefore

216
00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:14.700
it's there for in my
head. So you type two

217
00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:19.530
plus two, therefore, and it,
what that operator does is

218
00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:21.900
it takes everything to its
left and tries to give

219
00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:24.720
you the simplest form of
it. So in, in its

220
00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:27.450
case, it decided that two
plus two is best represented

221
00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:30.120
by the number four. And
that's actually how the code

222
00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:32.340
works. It's not sitting there
and saying, Oh, you know,

223
00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:34.200
these are two numbers. It's
just trying to find a

224
00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:37.530
very simple representation. So if
I had a bug in

225
00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:39.480
there, it might one day
decide that two plus two

226
00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:42.810
is actually fine. So anyway,
that's one line of code

227
00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:46.320
or code or calculation or
something. And then maybe on

228
00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.480
the next line, you can
just start creating variables a

229
00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:51.600
equals 42. And then on
the next line, you could

230
00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:55.380
say, well, Y equals a
plus 12, and now you

231
00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:59.580
have, you've defined a function.
You've defined a variable, you've

232
00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:03.450
done some calculations and you
just keep going along. And

233
00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:07.320
every so often just dropping
in this therefore operator and

234
00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:11.070
just seeing what it outputs
and more times than not,

235
00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:13.170
you kind of just get
a feel for how it

236
00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:15.960
works. And you're able to
quickly proceed from there and

237
00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:19.650
solve real problems. That's awesome.
So I've, I've got my

238
00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:21.660
two plus two and all
that written out. I just

239
00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:25.800
wrote two plus two, therefore,
and then just four appeared.

240
00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.720
And it has like a
background around it, like a

241
00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:31.350
gray background indicating that that's
a field that's been calculated.

242
00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:34.920
Yep. That's exactly what it
is. So here's your first

243
00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:38.670
public feature request. I clicked
the little sharing button at

244
00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:40.080
the bottom and now I
want to print it out.

245
00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:44.940
Yes, you can't. I don't
see. I see. Copy. I

246
00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:48.900
see messaged mail, Twitter and
Facebook. This is a problem

247
00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:53.240
with me using iOS seven.
Okay. It'll be there soon.

248
00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:58.210
I promise It does work
though. Maybe, maybe I'm on

249
00:14:58.210 --> 00:15:02.860
iOS seven, too IOS. Oh,
okay. Well that's, that's really

250
00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:06.580
interesting. iOS has introduced a
new feature where back in

251
00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:08.380
the day, we all had
to write our own sharing

252
00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:09.760
features. So if you want
to print, you had to

253
00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:11.380
write print. If you wanted
to share it on Twitter,

254
00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:14.230
you had to write that
the operating system now is

255
00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:16.240
trying to take care of
more of that stuff for

256
00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:19.570
us. And so what you
do nowadays is you bundle

257
00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:21.430
it all up into a
bunch of data, give it

258
00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:24.700
like mime types and hand
it to a thing. And

259
00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:27.880
that thing is supposed to
pick the appropriate ways to

260
00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:30.490
output the file. And I
know it looks like it's

261
00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:32.920
not. Yeah. So I'll have
to definitely take a look

262
00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:34.900
at that. Okay. Well, I
apologize for calling you out.

263
00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:38.350
Oh no, that's fun. It's
all I've been doing for

264
00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:43.660
the last four weeks is
justifying decisions. That's awesome. So

265
00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:45.370
talk to me about how
you wrote it though. What

266
00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:48.910
is this written in? Yeah,
so this is a hundred

267
00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:53.860
percent C-sharp application. I wrote
it in Xamarin studio, the

268
00:15:53.860 --> 00:16:00.400
IDE on the Macintosh, I'm
using Xamarin iOS, all targeting

269
00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:04.810
iOS. Actually, no, I take
that back. I started out

270
00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:07.960
on iOS 10. I started
out on the Mac because

271
00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:11.140
that's where I actually needed
the application. So I started

272
00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:16.330
using Xamarin dot Mac and
wrote out pretty much the

273
00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:21.340
entire application as an OS
10 app, and then ported

274
00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:25.960
it over to iOS. When
I realized that I actually

275
00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:27.700
did want to look at
some of the stuff while

276
00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:32.410
I was being mobile. So
you started on the desktop

277
00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:37.660
in C-sharp writing for your
Mac. You're a Mac person.

278
00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:39.910
You're an iPad person. You're
an iPhone person. You didn't

279
00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:43.540
have a windows machine involved
this at any point. I

280
00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:46.360
do have a windows machine
involved now, but in the

281
00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:50.520
beginning, no, I, I use
a windows machine a couple

282
00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:53.800
times a month. Yeah. Wow.
Okay. But you, but you

283
00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:56.920
do your stuff in C
sharp. That's that's interesting. Yeah.

284
00:16:56.950 --> 00:17:00.130
It's, it's a little weird,
huh? I guess. Well, the

285
00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:04.780
thing is, I, I, I'm
a windows programmer by history.

286
00:17:05.830 --> 00:17:08.650
My, my first big programs
when I got serious about

287
00:17:08.650 --> 00:17:13.180
programming were giant C plus
plus things and MFC, I

288
00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:16.840
love the win 32 API.
I love the anti kernel.

289
00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:22.000
I grew to like WinForms.
And that, that was my

290
00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.570
world. I loved windows, but
then the iPhone came out

291
00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:27.790
and I found something else
that I loved even more.

292
00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:30.610
And so I ended up
switching to Mac. And so

293
00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:34.960
I do have a strong
history and windows. And that's

294
00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:39.010
definitely why I was interested
in C-sharp when Xamarin came

295
00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:42.310
out with it. So when
you wrote this, I know

296
00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:44.860
that when you write C-sharp
on a Mac or an

297
00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:48.490
iPhone, you, you write the
UI part. What minimal UI

298
00:17:48.490 --> 00:17:51.030
you have, although you do
have a custom keyboard, you

299
00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:55.860
write that UI part, using
the tools that is native

300
00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:59.100
to the application. So you're
writing, you know, what a

301
00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:02.160
P list or whatever the
Mac thing is that represents

302
00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:04.260
a UI. You're not writing
it in WPF. You're not

303
00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:08.330
writing it in windfall. When
you think of PLS, when

304
00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:10.790
you think of Mac, I
think that's really funny actually.

305
00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:12.440
Does that make me old?
Did I use that wrong?

306
00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:15.260
No, no. You use it
a hundred percent correct? It's

307
00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:17.750
it's, it's just, you know,
it's, it's their form of

308
00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:22.010
XML. It's it's every everything
can be done in a

309
00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:24.140
Pew list. Why would you
need anything else? Well, that's

310
00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:26.150
the funny thing about a
man. I tease people about

311
00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:27.770
max, but I've got two
or three in the house

312
00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:32.630
here, but I've decided that
Macintoshes are basically three things.

313
00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:36.770
They are P lists that
make PNGs that are wrapped

314
00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:40.700
around shell strips. So like,
it's this amazing, beautiful thing,

315
00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:45.950
but it's all just held
together with just <inaudible>. Well,

316
00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:48.230
you know, there's a lot
of PDF files in there

317
00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:51.470
too nowadays, since that is
true, actually they've upgraded here.

318
00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:54.620
So I'm sorry. I took
us off That's okay. Did

319
00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:58.280
you make the UI specific?
Like, is it like model

320
00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:00.890
view controller, and then there
is there some I'm kind

321
00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:04.940
of imagining like Calca dot
Corp. That's like innovative and

322
00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:09.140
I called it a Calcutta
lib. It's called Copa lib,

323
00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:11.840
not calc a core I've
I've changed my naming scheme.

324
00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:15.680
Yeah. You, you nailed it
though. That's that's exactly what

325
00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:19.340
you do. So this is
a a hundred percent cocoa

326
00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:22.640
application. Coco is the overriding
name for the frameworks on

327
00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:27.830
Mac, more specifically, it's an
app kit application kit. That's

328
00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:31.310
another library that they have.
And specific to that, it's

329
00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:35.240
a document based application CA
app. So for windows programmers

330
00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:40.520
out there, it's exactly like
MFC, NSC. Yeah. Microsoft foundation

331
00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:45.140
class yet in that it
provides you a lot. Like

332
00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:48.560
it gives you a template
for a document based application.

333
00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:51.470
So you can say file
new project in X code

334
00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:56.360
or Xamarin studio. And out
comes this it's, it's a

335
00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:59.420
blank white window, but it's
all set for file operations,

336
00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:02.720
undo, buffers, all that stuff.
The application kit gives you

337
00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:06.110
just a bucket of tools
by default. And so it's

338
00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:09.650
really easy to write desktop
applications in it almost just

339
00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:11.600
like it was easy to
write MFC apps back in

340
00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:15.140
the day. So it's a
great place to start. Whenever

341
00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:16.970
you have a new idea,
it's just a great place

342
00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:21.320
to start. It's actually easier
to write apps in C

343
00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:23.120
sharp on a Mac than
it is to write them

344
00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:27.920
in straight objective C. Oh
yeah. And if you think

345
00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:29.630
that'd be interesting to have
it like to have there

346
00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:33.650
be a race. Oh, racing's
terrible res racing's a bad

347
00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:39.560
idea, but there are definite
performance improve. Geez, can't use

348
00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:45.890
that word. Productivity improvements C
sharps or product T C

349
00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:49.390
sharp is a productivity language.
Simple as that, it was

350
00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:54.400
designed to make programmers lives
better. And C was designed

351
00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:58.600
to make compilers and operating
systems better. Not humans. Now

352
00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:03.430
objective C objective C has
definitely grown, but you know,

353
00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:06.640
as I said, with Java,
just having a garbage collector

354
00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:10.090
solves so many problems. So
it's not just the language.

355
00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:13.720
It's the.net runtime too. So
I have a garbage collector

356
00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:17.170
reflection, all these powerful things
from around time. I have

357
00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:22.660
this crazy powerful programming language,
which in some ways it's

358
00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:24.550
a tiny bit long in
the tooth, but in other

359
00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:27.670
ways is leading the pack
and features like the await

360
00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:32.200
keyword recently introduced, puts every
other language, every, every other

361
00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:34.870
language to shame that they
don't have a feature that

362
00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:37.990
powerful. So there are just
some parts of C sharp

363
00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:42.130
that I absolutely adore and
would be miserable having not

364
00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:44.980
having, I mean, from time,
from time to time, I

365
00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:47.830
do actually do Perl programming
on the side. And so

366
00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:50.410
it's, it's fun to live
in the two universes that

367
00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:54.700
are so diametrically opposite, but
yeah, started out as a

368
00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:58.260
C sharp app because I
love that platform. So that

369
00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:02.220
means then if there's a
Calca lib than our Calca

370
00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:05.790
core, then you have a
windows version coming like you

371
00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:07.830
would have to. Cause you
have to prove that you

372
00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:09.780
have to prove that you
can write once run anywhere

373
00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:13.320
Of course, and deep, dark
secret. I even know of

374
00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:15.930
a financial institution who has
a bunch of people using

375
00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:21.750
Calca for windows In a
month. This happened. Yeah. And

376
00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:25.350
well, honestly that version took
three hours. I sat down

377
00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:30.060
and, you know, I wrote
a WinForms app. You can

378
00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:32.610
make fun of me in
a moment. I went forms

379
00:22:32.610 --> 00:22:35.400
app, you know, it gives
you buttons and dialog boxes,

380
00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:38.490
and that's about it. So
you have to build up

381
00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:42.150
a document architecture. It's not
like MSC, it's not like

382
00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:44.220
app kit. So you have
to build a real, you

383
00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:46.290
have to, you know, create
the file menu file, open

384
00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:48.510
file, save, handle collisions, all
that stuff. You have to

385
00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:51.210
do all that manually. So
I would say I spent

386
00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:55.050
about two hours and 59
minutes working on that. And

387
00:22:55.050 --> 00:22:58.500
then one minute porting the
engine over to windows and

388
00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:02.640
then it just worked seriously.
You just come recompiled fixed

389
00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:05.790
one hour. And that was
it. Yeah. I use the.net

390
00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:08.430
4.5 feature in the core
of the engine. And I

391
00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:10.830
was targeting dotnet at three
five. So I just rewrote

392
00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:13.920
that one line of code.
And that was that. It's

393
00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:16.920
funny that on the version
of.net I'm using on iOS

394
00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:18.990
is farther along than the
one I'm going to release

395
00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:22.290
on iOS, you know, on,
on for iOS, we were

396
00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:26.850
using.net 4.5, but I'm shooting
for 3.5 for windows. Right?

397
00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:30.600
Really. So you're actually shooting
for a larger audience. You're

398
00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:33.030
going to use an older
version of.net. So as to

399
00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:38.550
work anywhere. Yeah, that's it.
I want the single executable

400
00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:42.810
in a zip file deployment
strategy. I just know a

401
00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:45.620
lot of people stuck in
corporate environments where really just

402
00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:48.590
can't run installers. They can't
do this or that. So

403
00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:52.190
everything that this application needs,
needs to be in that

404
00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:55.100
exe or already on the
system. So on really low

405
00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:58.820
targets, zero dependencies, that kind
of executable is what I'm

406
00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:01.840
shooting for. So if someone
already has done it three,

407
00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:04.060
three, five, that it'll just
work. What about all those

408
00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:08.800
wait, keywords and things? Well,
you know, that's, so I

409
00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:12.430
avoided the await keyword in
the core library. So the

410
00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:17.170
awake key word is it's,
it's, it's a miracle for

411
00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:21.160
user interface work, but it's
not strictly necessary when you're

412
00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:24.730
doing library type work. And
in some cases it's not

413
00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:29.500
even good to use when
you're creating libraries. Yeah. So

414
00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:32.290
it, it just, fortunately the
way I coded it, it

415
00:24:32.290 --> 00:24:35.350
never made its way into
the core lib. That's actually

416
00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:37.990
an interesting point. If one
is going to make something

417
00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:40.930
that has a UI and
a core lib that they

418
00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:43.960
really should be thinking about
what the strongest, but lowest

419
00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:48.610
common denominator Could be. Yeah.
Yeah. Well, this isn't the

420
00:24:48.610 --> 00:24:51.280
first step I've poured it
across platform. So I kind

421
00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:53.500
of had some lessons learned
or been burnt by the

422
00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:57.400
fire or whatever you want
to say for prior decision.

423
00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:00.640
So I had low expectations
and just shop for the

424
00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:06.040
low expectations. Interesting. So if
you have an iPhone, iPad

425
00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:08.860
and Mac in each of
those gets you a store,

426
00:25:09.490 --> 00:25:12.910
but rather than windows eight
store, which would be one

427
00:25:12.910 --> 00:25:15.160
less thing to worry about,
you're doing an app that

428
00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:16.780
will run out of a
zip file. How will you

429
00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:21.370
sell that is PayPal. Yeah.
Gosh. Yeah. It's it's well,

430
00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:27.760
it's going to be Stripe.
I think that that's, that's,

431
00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:31.150
that's been the biggest problem.
Scott of releasing apps for

432
00:25:31.150 --> 00:25:34.660
windows. Is there a lack
of having a store for

433
00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:38.710
desktop apps? So the only
in case your listeners don't

434
00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:40.930
know that your only options
are right when our T

435
00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:42.970
app, and then you can
be on the store. If

436
00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:45.070
you write a desktop app,
well, you can still have

437
00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:47.560
your icon on the store,
but it, it redirects to

438
00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:49.600
your website. So you have
to do all the commerce

439
00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:53.500
stuff. And absolutely, I do
not want to run a

440
00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:57.280
commerce website. And so I've
always held off from releasing

441
00:25:57.340 --> 00:26:01.870
windows versions of my apps,
but I've just decided that

442
00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:04.210
I have to bite the
bullet and just do it

443
00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:08.080
Interesting. So for the, because
of corporate America and all

444
00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:10.570
the XP machines and different
people in finance that you

445
00:26:10.570 --> 00:26:17.080
want to support windows eight
is an option. Yeah. When

446
00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:19.420
does it's? No, no, I
won't say windows eight is

447
00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:22.030
not an option because I
would love to port to

448
00:26:22.090 --> 00:26:27.250
it. But the man, I,
I have to sound like

449
00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:29.950
a business jerk for a
minute. The numbers just aren't

450
00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:32.470
there. The market's just not
there. It's not worth my

451
00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:40.480
effort. Yeah. Interesting, interesting. When
you have so many versions

452
00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:43.060
on so many platforms, how
are you, how are you

453
00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:45.480
all of this? Like what
if you found something about

454
00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:48.060
four and then you suddenly
had to release iPad, iPhone,

455
00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:52.430
iPod, Mac windows, et cetera,
et cetera. Yeah. That, that's

456
00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:58.550
probably the hardest problem. So
let's, let's start with, how

457
00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:00.860
do I test it? Because
I think that's kind of

458
00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:03.950
interesting for an application like
this. This is the first

459
00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:06.350
app that I wrote with
kind of a test first

460
00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:11.270
mindset. And so this is
probably my best tested application.

461
00:27:11.270 --> 00:27:14.720
I have many thousands of
unit tests that have runs,

462
00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:20.180
so that's good. I pretty
much detect errors in the

463
00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:24.320
engine, the core lib instantaneously.
So that just leaves UI

464
00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:28.460
bugs to hash out. So
yeah, if you're on three

465
00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:33.320
different platforms, generally that's three
different UI code bases that

466
00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:35.750
you have to maintain each
with its own unique set

467
00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:39.260
of problems and features and
bug lists and all of

468
00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:43.220
that. So that's a tricky,
that's not tricky. It's just

469
00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:45.230
a lot of work to
maintain those UI. So you're

470
00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:47.780
constantly looking to share more
and more code as you

471
00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:52.370
possibly can between them. And
then you ask the question

472
00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:55.940
about releasing well, that's where
I've made big mistakes in

473
00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:59.540
the past, where I've allowed
different platforms to get out

474
00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:01.880
of sync with each other.
And this is the frustrating

475
00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:04.430
part. It's never because of
the core engine or the

476
00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:07.700
core library. Those, those, that
guy, port's just fine. And

477
00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:11.270
he's easy to update. It's
always the UI just decays

478
00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:15.410
false behind like say I
write a very fascinating new

479
00:28:15.410 --> 00:28:20.600
visualization on iOS. Well, if
I took advantage of a

480
00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:23.870
lot of iOS specific features
to make that performance or

481
00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:26.570
whatever, then I have to
back port that to all

482
00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:29.360
the other platforms. And that's
a lot of work. So

483
00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:32.120
coming up with intelligent solutions
to those kinds of problems

484
00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:37.250
is very high on my
priority list. And then I'm

485
00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:41.210
releasing is just about developing
a discipline to say that

486
00:28:41.210 --> 00:28:43.880
when I release one, I
should release all three. And

487
00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:48.910
I'm just, I'm personally working
to develop that discipline. Yeah.

488
00:28:48.910 --> 00:28:50.570
It really is an issue
of discipline though. Isn't it?

489
00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:53.420
Oh, that's, that's all it
is. That's all any of

490
00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:58.100
this stuff. It's just, it's
so easy for me to

491
00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:01.010
release an iOS version and
allow the Mac version to

492
00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:04.880
decay or something like that.
It's so easy, But are

493
00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:09.380
you just one person working
on it? Yeah. Yeah. One

494
00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:15.110
person design engineering, product support,
marketing sales. Yep. It's fun.

495
00:29:16.670 --> 00:29:23.690
No pressure. No, no, no
worries. Well, that's amazing. Yeah.

496
00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:28.040
Thank you. Appreciate it. Like
I said, it's just discipline

497
00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:31.700
and some weeks you're better.
Other weeks you're worse. You

498
00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:35.180
just try to keep your
average nice and high. No,

499
00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:38.030
there's there's another app on
Mac. I don't know. I

500
00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:40.400
think they just came out
an iPhone iPad called solver

501
00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:43.570
solver with a, yeah. So
you L it looks more

502
00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:48.880
like a spreadsheet without a
grid Mia. Sure. Okay. But,

503
00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:51.940
but, but it has the
same kind of, you know,

504
00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:55.180
open-ended do what you want.
W how would you describe,

505
00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:57.880
how would you describe the
difference between Calca and solver

506
00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:02.010
for people who may be
familiar already with solver? So

507
00:30:02.010 --> 00:30:03.750
I'll say straight off the
bat that I was a

508
00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:07.830
prolific solver user before I
had Kalka in a lot

509
00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:11.460
of ways, it was deficiencies
in solver that inspired me

510
00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:17.520
to make Kalka. So, as
a comparison, they're both update

511
00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:21.360
calculations as you type. So
as you change number the

512
00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:24.210
rest of the sheet, or
document wonder, whatever you want

513
00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:28.770
to call, it gets updated.
It's very pretty, it's still

514
00:30:28.770 --> 00:30:31.290
prettier than Calca. In my
opinion, I got to work

515
00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:35.310
on my styling. It's got
a lot of built in

516
00:30:35.730 --> 00:30:42.360
stuff, currency, conversion, functions, all
of that. But in the

517
00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:46.650
end, the application is it's,
it's a lot like running

518
00:30:46.650 --> 00:30:50.760
just a Python interpreter, or
I guess Java script as

519
00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:53.130
if you just brought up
node and just started typing

520
00:30:53.130 --> 00:30:56.010
some node commands. So you
type two plus two hit

521
00:30:56.010 --> 00:30:59.490
enter, and it gives you
the number four. It's not

522
00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:02.310
good at doing, or it
doesn't even try to do

523
00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:07.050
symbolic manipulation. That is, it
can't handle equations with unknowns.

524
00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:11.100
So if I say, well,
this Y equals M times

525
00:31:11.130 --> 00:31:14.250
X plus B. It's not
going to do anything until

526
00:31:14.250 --> 00:31:16.380
I tell it what M
what X and what B

527
00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:20.430
R. Whereas Calca just, if
you don't define them, it

528
00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:22.740
just treats them as symbols.
And it just carries them

529
00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:26.300
on through all the calculations.
And so what I, the,

530
00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:31.140
the contrast between solver and
Calca is primarily there where

531
00:31:31.170 --> 00:31:36.570
this is a symbolic calculator,
not just a calculator. Okay.

532
00:31:36.930 --> 00:31:39.870
I noticed that right on
the homepage. You've got this

533
00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:42.720
back tick in front of
some numbers that is like,

534
00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:45.960
surrounded. Like, it's not a
single quote. That's not my

535
00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:49.410
fault. That's John Gruber's. What
does that mean? Because I

536
00:31:49.410 --> 00:31:52.830
can't find that button on
my keyboard. It's up there.

537
00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:56.790
It's in the upper left,
it's called back quote or

538
00:31:56.790 --> 00:32:00.300
tick. I tend to call
it tick. Where did it

539
00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:03.840
come from? What does it
mean though? It says I'm

540
00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:06.750
looking to buy. What it
actually means Is, is you're,

541
00:32:06.890 --> 00:32:11.250
you're, you're stuck in a
paragraph of text and you

542
00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:15.960
want to call out something
as being code or referencing

543
00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:19.140
a calculation, something that does
something, not just texts that

544
00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:22.290
sits there. And you use
the Bactec to put you

545
00:32:22.290 --> 00:32:26.670
basically in a code environment,
it means code. So anyone

546
00:32:26.670 --> 00:32:29.430
who's ever written like a
law tech or tech document

547
00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:32.820
knows that you put dollar
signs around symbols. This is

548
00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:35.790
basically those dollar signs. You're
okay. So it's limiting in

549
00:32:35.790 --> 00:32:38.850
HTML. It's pretty, it's pretty.
Yes. That's exactly what it

550
00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:41.800
is. It's pre your code,
Looking at code. I'm running

551
00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:45.100
Calca on my iPhone and
I don't have that button.

552
00:32:46.210 --> 00:32:50.240
You do. It's it's, it's
hidden. You have to hold

553
00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:53.650
it. You have to hold
the quote button. Yeah, I

554
00:32:53.650 --> 00:32:56.650
got it. There, hold down
single quote, and then it

555
00:32:56.650 --> 00:33:00.310
pops out and then it
gives me four other kinds

556
00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:03.170
of quotes that I could
pick. And I picked that.

557
00:33:03.170 --> 00:33:06.850
Not ideal. Yeah. I, I
give a keyboard accessory on

558
00:33:06.850 --> 00:33:10.090
iOS, but I still need
to even do more improvements

559
00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:14.590
for making the keyboard easier
to use on iOS. Well,

560
00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:17.260
considering How, I mean, you've
added an extra two rows

561
00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:20.050
of keyboard. There's not much
more room. I don't think

562
00:33:20.050 --> 00:33:22.240
I'm doing a lot of
calculations on a phone. I

563
00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:24.520
think that for me, the
killer app for this is

564
00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:26.230
the iPad. I mean, I'm
going to show this to

565
00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:28.600
my wife and she's going
to freak out. This is

566
00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:30.490
going to be awesome. She's
a, she has an MBA

567
00:33:30.490 --> 00:33:32.230
and she's into business and
finance and she's going to

568
00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:35.680
love it. Oh yeah. There
you go. Yeah. Accountants. That's

569
00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:37.120
what I want you to
know when I was writing

570
00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:39.790
it. I was thinking of
programmers and engineers, but I

571
00:33:39.790 --> 00:33:43.540
was totally blind accountants, obviously,
accountants. They love this thing.

572
00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:49.120
No, I literally A copy
of this to my finance

573
00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:53.110
guy who still has like
an old Reverse Polish calculator.

574
00:33:53.170 --> 00:33:57.340
Yeah, sure, sure. Yeah. It's
it's funny. You bring up

575
00:33:57.340 --> 00:34:00.790
RPN. Yeah. We, we, we
got advanced the state of

576
00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:04.810
the art, right. RPN is
so 1970s. Well, yeah. So

577
00:34:04.810 --> 00:34:09.790
as my accountant, I'm afraid.
Okay. Well, I tweeted this

578
00:34:09.790 --> 00:34:11.650
just now, when people are
saying they want the windows

579
00:34:11.650 --> 00:34:15.640
version, so get it, get
on that. Yeah. Yeah. I'm

580
00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:19.660
working on it. So we
could go into technology, reasons

581
00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:21.790
of why that's actually going
slow if you ever care.

582
00:34:21.970 --> 00:34:25.990
But I see where we're,
I've already talked a lot,

583
00:34:25.990 --> 00:34:29.440
but no, this is Brian.
I'm fighting with 32 right

584
00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:32.350
now. Yeah, I would, I
would love to see in

585
00:34:32.350 --> 00:34:34.780
the, in the future, if
you haven't already started doing

586
00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:38.590
it on your blog, you
know, more discussion about kind

587
00:34:38.590 --> 00:34:40.180
of how, how you made
it and some of the

588
00:34:40.180 --> 00:34:44.800
issues around writing apps for
any platform. I think that's

589
00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:48.250
a really interesting idea. And
some of the things that

590
00:34:48.250 --> 00:34:52.450
you've learned about targeting four
or five different things with

591
00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:57.850
core with one core engine
is amazing. Yeah. We're, we're

592
00:34:57.850 --> 00:35:01.270
slowly building up this knowledge
base of how to go

593
00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:04.420
about this correctly. A bunch
of guys in Samran are

594
00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:06.640
starting to get a feel
for it. There's a few

595
00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:10.210
people like me, John Lipski,
others who are been putting

596
00:35:10.210 --> 00:35:14.620
programs around, we are starting
to develop decent patterns for

597
00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:19.240
this practice and well, and
then there's the block. Gosh,

598
00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:20.710
I didn't know how long
it takes to write a

599
00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:24.130
blog entry. How do you
do it, man? Yeah, it

600
00:35:24.130 --> 00:35:26.170
takes awhile. It's a problem.
But actually I need to,

601
00:35:26.170 --> 00:35:28.060
you know, when I write
a lot of blog posts

602
00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:29.530
and I say to myself,
it's time for me to

603
00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:32.950
write more, more code. So
you, you oscillate back and

604
00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:35.200
forth. Yeah. I feel like
I need a good half

605
00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:38.100
day to write a blog
post or at least A

606
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:40.080
day. I don't know. It's
a lot of code though.

607
00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:42.420
You're not writing if you're
writing a blog post. Yeah.

608
00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:44.880
Yeah. Sometimes you can get
the blog post code into

609
00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:46.920
your major code base. I've
tried that trick a few

610
00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:51.690
times. Well, I really appreciate
you chatting with me today,

611
00:35:51.690 --> 00:35:54.450
Frank. I really appreciate you
having me. It's been a

612
00:35:54.450 --> 00:35:58.020
long time ambition of mine
to get to be on

613
00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:00.780
your podcast. So thank you
very much for having me.

614
00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:07.530
Absolutely. My pleasure folks can
check out. calca@calc.io. It's a

615
00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:09.270
minutes and we'll see you
again next week.
