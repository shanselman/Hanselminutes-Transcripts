episode, Scott talks with Richard Campbell.

7
00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:48.890
Hi, this is Scott Hanselman,
and this is another episode

8
00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.310
of Hansel minutes. And you
know, I talked to Richard Campbell

9
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.980
last week and it was
just too much darn fun.

10
00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.840
And we kept talking after,
after we recorded. So who

11
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.730
knows? Maybe it's a regular
thing. Maybe it's not, you

12
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.190
know, I'll talk to Richard
as long as he'll talk

13
00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.770
to me. So it's, it's
back. He's back. It's Richard,

14
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.800
you started with, you started
it. That's not me. Where

15
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.950
were we? I think it
was in Wisconsin where we

16
00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.950
ended up doing that whole
discussion about our horror stories

17
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.150
of dealing with scaling websites.
Oh yeah. That's when it

18
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.460
starts with a startup, we
were, we were sitting in

19
00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.090
wasn't Wisconsin. I think it
was a queer sitting in

20
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.450
the corner of a conference
though, somewhere and said, Oh,

21
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.200
that's a good idea. Let's
restart recording. Is it Wisconsin,

22
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.050
Ohio? Yeah, it was somewhere
in the Midwest, somewhere in

23
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.870
the Midwest. Yeah. So I
tried to call you a

24
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.950
minute ago and you succeeded
in calling me. Well, I

25
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.470
did call you we're talking
now, but I couldn't find

26
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.500
your cell. So I dialed
what I thought was your

27
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.770
cell. You did an ad
by cell automatically when I'm

28
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.960
in my office. Cause I
shut my cell off because

29
00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.010
it interferes with the, with
audio stuff. It automatically forwards

30
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.310
to the office number. Okay.
So then the office phone

31
00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.180
says, hi, you've reached the
Campbell residence. Please say the

32
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.900
name of who you want
to talk to. I'm like,

33
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:10.790
well I just wouldn't. I
couldn't. I called and I

34
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.310
do. I call that, I
call a house. This is

35
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.480
his family, you know? So
I just said Richard, and

36
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.690
then it said calling Richard Campbell,
and then I got you.

37
00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.440
Right? That's hardcore. That's your
freaking house. Well, for starters,

38
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.320
no phone actually rang until
you said Richard and it

39
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.310
went to my phone. So
no. Okay. Well where, what

40
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.220
rang? I mean something, my,
the point is that when

41
00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.950
you just call me until
you say my name, no

42
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.660
phone rang anywhere in the
house. The nice thing is

43
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.610
that is when you're staying
at my place, for example,

44
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.880
Scott, you can have your
kids call the house and

45
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.460
just say guests and it'll
go ring only in the

46
00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.690
guestroom. Wow. So it just,
and it totally does in

47
00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.220
the telemarketer because they don't
know who they're calling. Right?

48
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.010
Because you didn't, this was
what was interesting. I waited,

49
00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.320
I waited for the list.
That's right there. The reason

50
00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.260
I never got a list,
I turned the list for

51
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.050
exactly that reason. Okay. That
is this Google voice or

52
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.580
what is happening. This product
is made by Microsoft and

53
00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.360
it's called, it's called some
point response point. I'm going

54
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.310
to Google that with bang
right now. Yeah. Well then

55
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.070
you can go to microsoft.com/response
point. There's a whole site

56
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.680
there. Okay. It came out
a couple of years ago.

57
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.070
There's three different hardware manufacturers
making stuff for this company

58
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.030
called SIS pine, small business,
small business phone system. That's

59
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.020
right. Buy online. So I
picked up a cyst pine

60
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.930
system, which was the base
unit with four phone lines

61
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.290
going into it and six
handsets for about 1200 bucks.

62
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.340
Okay. Oh, they have a
Costco. There you go. Alright.

63
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.920
This is, this is insane.
I've never heard of this.

64
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.250
Oh wow. Look at that
void fist system with four

65
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.880
phones is like a box
powered by Microsoft response point.

66
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.320
And there's a whole thing,
man. Eight different analog phone

67
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.410
lines, 50th extensions. But plus
it also supports all the

68
00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:57.760
sip lines. So if you
want to bring in, you

69
00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.970
know, VoIP lines, that's fine.
It works with that. Just

70
00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.210
fine. But also stuff like
you can set up an

71
00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:06.250
audit. Well, I've got to
configure with auto attendant or

72
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.050
you can have it go
to a particular phone line

73
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.480
in the auto attendant mode.
You can ask questions, like,

74
00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.850
what is your fax number?
What are your hours and

75
00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.490
so forth? And you can
prerecord responses to all those

76
00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:20.710
things. So it's very clever
for an inexpensive phone system

77
00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:25.300
is a cyst pine six
pack. Yeah. The, the reason

78
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.580
I put it into the
house was I got teenage

79
00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.010
daughters. So I don't want
to take their messages. I

80
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.870
want to just forward it
to their phone. So don't

81
00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.280
want to hear the phone
ring. Don't want to hear

82
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.710
the phone ringing less it's
for me, there's a blue

83
00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.900
button on all these phones.
When you push that, say

84
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.550
I'm, we're on a call.
And you know, I pick

85
00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.470
up the call and it's
for one of my daughters,

86
00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.200
I pushed the blue button,
say transfer to daughter and

87
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.410
it takes the call over
there. Well, Intercom system through

88
00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:48.700
the whole house. So you
can hit a button and

89
00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.040
say inner calm to the
phone you want to go

90
00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.760
to and just sends you
there. That's insane. It's it's

91
00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.520
amazing little product. It just
stand by it. And nobody

92
00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.740
seems to know about your
phone system. Like how does

93
00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.980
that work? There's the thing.
There's the box and all

94
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.590
the software, right? How do
you use Vonage or who's

95
00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.650
doing the phony part? So
I have analog lines from

96
00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.190
the local telco. Who is
that? I think one of

97
00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:20.250
my sons has picked up
the phone. Yup. Hold on

98
00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:21.510
one second. I'm gonna put
the phone down. This will

99
00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:52.920
be an edit point. No
problem, Mommy. Please. Can you

100
00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:59.570
tell mommy to keep me
busy off the phone? That

101
00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:08.470
was awesome. We got to
leave that in. Hi. So

102
00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:11.200
speaking of phone systems, what
did it have prevented that

103
00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:15.400
Yes, actually, because it's a
PBX, so there's no way

104
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.550
to pick up a line
PBX. It's like I had

105
00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:20.770
a dial nine for an
outside line. Did the whole

106
00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:23.200
concept of being able to
pick up an existing phone

107
00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.140
line is foreign, right? Oh,
it's like an interest. So

108
00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:29.560
PBX is an internal phone
system, right? Phones. Isn't that

109
00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.090
doesn't yet it doesn't leave
the house and let you,

110
00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.490
unless you let it leave
the house. Yeah. Private exchange.

111
00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:36.040
Right? That's the whole idea.
So if I want somebody

112
00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.720
else to be able to
listen to this call, I

113
00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.510
would have to press the
conference line and tell it

114
00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:42.520
what phone, the phone I
wanted to pull into the

115
00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.050
call. And then we'd both
be on that kind of

116
00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:47.800
thing. What's the difference between
response point asterix or putting

117
00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.410
it that open source PBX
thing? There's really not A

118
00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:51.970
lot of difference between the
two they're more or less

119
00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:54.010
the same thing. The only
thing with asterix being open

120
00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:56.980
source is that you got
to pick a vendor. You

121
00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:58.990
know, there's lots of different
products or trying to assemble

122
00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:01.660
it yourself. And I really
looked hard at, I was

123
00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:03.550
very close to buying an
asterick system before I found

124
00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:08.410
response point very, very close,
because I wanted those kinds

125
00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:10.890
of features. I wanted to
my email, to my voice

126
00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.450
mail to go directly to
email. I wanted all that

127
00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.880
Intercom stuff. I wanted all
those things and, and Astros

128
00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.860
off for the whole thing.
But you largely have to

129
00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:21.040
build it yourself. And this
was in a box, set

130
00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.680
it up, had it running
in an hour. It's got

131
00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.440
a windows interface. You know,
I dial the phone now

132
00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.540
by literally selecting from a
list of my numbers from

133
00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:31.150
outlook and saying, dial that
number and off it goes,

134
00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:34.630
wow, Well this isn't the
topic that I thought we

135
00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:36.460
were gonna talk about at
all. No, no. It's only

136
00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:38.380
happening because you phoned me,
right? Yeah. Yeah. That was

137
00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:40.120
cool. I'm never going to
phone you again. You've scared

138
00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:46.390
me away from your crazy
phone madness. So that's, that's

139
00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:49.390
pretty cool. Well, gosh, I
don't know if my 18

140
00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:51.820
month old David requires a
PBX at the house here,

141
00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:54.850
but I know where to
get one now. Oh yeah.

142
00:07:54.980 --> 00:08:00.850
Costco. Apparently. Yeah. That's pretty
slick. Cool. So gosh, it

143
00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:02.770
throw me for a loop.
I told totally. Hey, I've

144
00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:05.050
got a, a buddy of
mine loaned me his Kindle

145
00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:07.690
DX. I've got a Kindle.
That's the big one, right?

146
00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.810
Oh yeah. I've got this.
It's just, it's massive. Yeah.

147
00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:13.600
It's huge. Bigger than your
head. And that's a big

148
00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:15.490
thing to say, dude is
nothing bigger than my head.

149
00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:19.510
I've got a Kindle myself
and I love it. Love

150
00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:20.380
it. Love it. Love it.
Love it. Love it. I

151
00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:22.480
cannot say enough. Nice things
about, and I apologize to

152
00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:25.210
people who live internationally like
me, that, that you do

153
00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:27.370
not have the Kendall. Yeah.
You'd have to hold the,

154
00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:30.070
hold it up and pointed
towards the U S yeah.

155
00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.880
Well I've seriously considered it
Kindle the X. Cause it

156
00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:36.070
just had the USB interface.
So I should be able

157
00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:38.140
to load books and stuff
that way. Cause I obviously

158
00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:41.260
am outside of Sprint's coverage
from here. Right. And you

159
00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.050
can also email stuff directly
to the Kindle. So my

160
00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:46.270
each, each Kindle has its
own email address, which I

161
00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:48.730
think is very cool. It's
deeply cool. So if you

162
00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:51.100
have a PDF or a
word document or whatever, you

163
00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:52.990
can just forward it. And
with the Kindle DX, it's

164
00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:56.850
got native PDF support. But
The only way for me

165
00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:58.560
to be able to email
it is to be on

166
00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.210
that three G network. Cause
that's how it gets its

167
00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:02.870
name. No. Yeah, you're right.
You're right. That's yeah. If

168
00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:05.660
it had wifi, I just
need wifi, but you didn't

169
00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:08.870
have Sony just announced a
new reader. That's got wifi

170
00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:12.200
in it. Really? Yeah. I'm
pretty sure. Oh the Sony

171
00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.330
reader. I dunno. I just
did the Sony. I had

172
00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:16.970
the, I had the original,
original Sony reader back in

173
00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:19.250
the day and I ended
up sending it back. It

174
00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:21.530
was just, it wasn't, it
wasn't right. It wasn't set

175
00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:23.870
up to read. It was
set up to be a

176
00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:26.870
cool star Trek pad, but
it was not, I did

177
00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:30.920
not find it that useful.
I too have one of

178
00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.260
the original readers and I
still have mine because I

179
00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.020
could make it work outside
of the U S Yeah.

180
00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:39.380
Do you think wireless is
really necessary? You know what?

181
00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:41.540
I'm wrong? Sony does not
have wifi in it, but

182
00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:45.890
there's another one plan called
plastic. That has a, Yeah.

183
00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:50.660
What's that called? Real, real
plastic touch. Plastic Logic. Yeah.

184
00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:53.240
Something like that. Yeah. Well
the new ones, the new

185
00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:55.370
Sony is a touch, so
no wireless, but you can

186
00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:58.970
touch it. Yeah. But it
does have the three G

187
00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:00.800
network and they've got this
deal with the libraries, right?

188
00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.900
Like the New York library signed
up. So you get this

189
00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:07.730
sort of DRM book for
three weeks. Right. Which is

190
00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:09.710
interesting. I mean, you really
started to see a picture

191
00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:12.500
of where this is going
to go where we're, we're

192
00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:15.530
making these first stumbling steps,
but you know, give it

193
00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:17.330
a little more time and
we're going to have this

194
00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:19.280
device. I really think this
is going to be one

195
00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:23.000
device is PDA type device.
That is my phone. That

196
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.200
is my reader. That is,
you know, all of those

197
00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.990
things in one. Well, do
you think that they're, they're

198
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:33.860
an iPad is coming from
Apple. Absolutely. And you think

199
00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:36.440
that it's going to be
something that is a, is

200
00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.060
it going to be a
big iPhone or is it

201
00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:42.410
going to be a, a
color touchy Kendall Or I

202
00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:44.030
think it's going to be
a big iPhone. Do you

203
00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:46.340
think it's just a big
swollen iPhone? Well, the big

204
00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:51.170
six, seven inch Screen type
iPhone thinner. Yeah. Yeah. Whether

205
00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:52.610
it should be an eye
touch. Our iPhone is a

206
00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:55.310
good question, but I think
they're, they've got the touch

207
00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:57.500
thing down. They figured how
to make the screen bigger.

208
00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:00.920
And they're trying to sort
of cross that line into

209
00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:06.620
the tablet space. Apple's always
had Apple, never got over

210
00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:09.410
the Newton, you know? No.
Well, I mean, I haven't

211
00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:10.910
cut it with a Newton.
I'm looking at a Newton

212
00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:13.640
right now. It's sitting on
my account on my, my

213
00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:16.970
little Ikea shelves behind me
here. Yeah. Battery is fully

214
00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:20.070
discharged on it too, right?
No, actually it's funny. You

215
00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:22.140
mentioned that the great thing
about the Newton was that

216
00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:24.770
the AAA batteries would last
for two weeks. So I

217
00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:26.720
just have to visit my
Newton every, you know, twice

218
00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:29.960
a month and keep it
kind of keep it going.

219
00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:33.080
And I've got a, I've
got some massive, massive memory

220
00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:37.280
expansion. I've got the four
megabyte card there, megabyte piece

221
00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:41.240
megabyte card, which is nice.
And the two megabyte expansion

222
00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:45.200
card. So because the Newton
2000 had two slots, that

223
00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.240
was such a great device.
So far ahead of its

224
00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.970
time. Even if the battery
life it was glorious, it

225
00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:52.550
would last for weeks and
weeks and weeks it's sip

226
00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:55.420
the battery. So you're saying
that I get all the,

227
00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:58.570
all the benefits of the
iPhone and all the benefits

228
00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:00.910
of the iPhone is battery
life. So do I have

229
00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:03.220
to have a tether to
plug this thing into the

230
00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:05.520
mains? No. As long as
it's plugged into the wall,

231
00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:08.520
it'll be work just fine.
Yeah. That's going to be

232
00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:13.050
a giant remote control. You
are. You're going to need

233
00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:15.810
the I backpack. I think
I've done that. Have you

234
00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:17.580
seen those pictures of me?
Actually, I have a picture

235
00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:21.810
of me at PDC with
a laptop tethered to an

236
00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:24.210
iPhone talking on it because
it's the only thing that

237
00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:27.990
would get the iPhone past
the noon Mark, that that's

238
00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:30.570
like all technology on the
planet right now is focused

239
00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:33.840
on getting iPhones to last
beyond noon for, for their

240
00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:36.180
battery. There's a, I've been
looking at some of the

241
00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:39.240
military gear they've been playing
with now that uses physical

242
00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:42.030
motion to, to charge batteries.
And they've got one in

243
00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:45.780
the 150 watt range. Now
that fits into a backpack.

244
00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:47.520
So as you walk with
your backpack on, it would

245
00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:49.920
be charging batteries. That's cool.
You know, it didn't, they

246
00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:52.710
promise to do this with
our shoes. I mean, I

247
00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:54.990
think it's kind of ironic
that you can get the

248
00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:58.710
Nike shoe. I, you know,
iPod thing. Yeah. But they

249
00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:01.830
couldn't just throw a little
a rattle in there to,

250
00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:04.110
to make some power while
I'm running to my power

251
00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:08.640
song. Yeah. They, they are
still figuring that stuff out.

252
00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:11.100
That power is becoming the
problem more and more and

253
00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:13.260
more. It is the, how
do we package up power

254
00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.570
in a good package. Right.
And, and also in a

255
00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:19.290
way that isn't completely toxic
to the environment. My son

256
00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:23.430
has this Thomas, the tank
engine, right along train, like

257
00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:27.060
a little mini three-year-old size
train. And it uses this

258
00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:30.330
beast of a lead acid
battery. That, I mean, when

259
00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:35.310
I'm plugging it, it's like
this, this, this disgusting, you

260
00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:39.210
know, ecological nightmare in a
box that makes me feel

261
00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:41.700
I've made me feel like
I'm changing the, the battery

262
00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:44.130
on like an old Dodge
charger. And then I put

263
00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:47.190
the little plastic Thomas seat
on it and then suddenly

264
00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:49.470
like, I've hidden it. It's
just, it's just such a

265
00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:52.200
CLA the whole Thomas train
is really just a metaphor

266
00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.660
for, for everything that we're
doing right now. Everything that's

267
00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:56.640
wrong in this world. Right.
And I have to tell

268
00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:58.290
my son, you know, don't
open the seat, don't open

269
00:13:58.290 --> 00:14:00.480
the seat, you know, battery
acid leaking out of Thomas.

270
00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:03.120
And it's just, it's a
horrible, horrible thing. And of

271
00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:06.330
course the runtime on the
battery is like 12 minutes.

272
00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:09.360
Right. And then I was
just over at a Goodwill.

273
00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:11.850
Recently, you guys have Goodwill
and Canadian. Yeah. We have

274
00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:13.770
a version of that. Yes.
Okay. So go to, I

275
00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:16.650
was at Goodwill, which is
the local a second hand

276
00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:18.930
shop. And don't you love
it when you find something

277
00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:21.900
that just shouldn't be at
Goodwill. What's the story here?

278
00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:24.360
How did this get and
get here? Why, why, why

279
00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:27.300
did it come to me?
I found a Dyson, the

280
00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:32.040
Dyson vacuum cleaner, the Dyson
handheld vac brand new in

281
00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:38.550
the box got Goodwill and
Goodwill. Some corporation didn't want

282
00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:41.970
a freaking awesome vacuum, cleaner,
maybe battery life. And the

283
00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:45.720
vacuum is actually kept. It's
got, I don't know whether

284
00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.990
it's an expectations things, but
somehow Dyson put a timer

285
00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:52.490
on it. It'll run for
six minutes. Nice. Which is

286
00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:54.200
funny because my wife says
she can make it about

287
00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:56.660
three quarters of the way
up the stairs, and then

288
00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:58.820
it stops. And then now
she's mad at the she's

289
00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:01.610
like, this is a useless,
useless device. It has a

290
00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:04.700
weak battery. And I think
what the guy did cause

291
00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:08.480
you know, Dyson is obsessed
with, with sucking. I mean,

292
00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:14.690
with suction, he has, I
think I'm, I'm putting words

293
00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:18.890
in his mouth that he's,
he's basically controlling expectations of

294
00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:23.870
power and suction by capping
the amount of time. It'll

295
00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:26.260
never just fade away. Yeah.
No, he needs to be

296
00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:27.700
full power and it shuts
off at the moment. It's

297
00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:30.070
not full power. Okay. Exactly.
Yeah. That would be interesting

298
00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:34.990
if laptops and phones did
that. Sorry, I can't give

299
00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:37.180
you an awesome experience. So
no one will have it.

300
00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:39.550
They don't hate lead acid
batteries like you do, because

301
00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:42.730
I know they're fully recyclable
the chemicals in them, the

302
00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:45.790
led everything can be regenerated
and do a new battery.

303
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.180
I have to go find
the place. Yeah. But at

304
00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:51.910
least you can recycle it.
Many of these alkaline batteries

305
00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:55.440
and stuff, they're much tougher
to recycle really? Yeah. The

306
00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:58.240
technology for recycling lead acid.
I know it's not a

307
00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:00.550
pretty battery. And if you
put it in the garbage,

308
00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:03.880
you're committing a serious evil,
but I'm telling you virtually

309
00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:06.600
everything in the lead acid
battery can be recycled. Oh,

310
00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:09.040
That's good. So I just
need to find my local

311
00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:11.650
recycling place. That's right. Which
really you need to be

312
00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:14.200
doing with all your batteries.
Batteries need a separate place.

313
00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:17.800
I have a garbage, a
plastic garbage can full of

314
00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:20.890
bad. No, I just call
your house and say battery

315
00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:23.800
recycling center. And I'll be
transferred to that. Well, there

316
00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:26.350
is therein lies, the real
problem, which is the recycling

317
00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:28.840
centers. There's only one, it's
a total pain in the

318
00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:30.550
ass to get to. So
I literally have two or

319
00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:32.980
three years worth of batteries
piling up in this bin.

320
00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:34.690
And I don't even want
to know what's growing at

321
00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:37.360
the bottom of that camp.
Nice. Well now you know

322
00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:40.240
what you need to do
today? Take my batteries in

323
00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:44.830
for recycling. Let me see.
I can hear the public

324
00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:47.350
service announcement music now playing
here on the handsome and

325
00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:50.930
the show pop out, you
know, the more, you know.

326
00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:56.170
Yeah. So I got really
bent up the other day,

327
00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:59.440
looking at how far behind
windows mobile had gotten with

328
00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:02.650
6.5 and thinking about wind
seven. And it suddenly hit

329
00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:05.140
me that I don't know
if it's even relevant anymore

330
00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:08.140
Mobile operating systems at all.
Yeah. I don't think you

331
00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:10.690
need Mo because I'm looking
at the next, the next

332
00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:13.630
two generations of PDA hardware
coming out have got the

333
00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:16.930
horsepower of an average desktop.
So at least, yeah. I

334
00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:18.790
mean it doesn't the average
windows mobile device got like

335
00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:22.210
600 megahertz iPhone, 600 megahertz.
Well, and now an arm

336
00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:25.420
announced they're going to start
making multi-core processors for PDAs.

337
00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:29.710
Wow. So, you know, we're
just not that far away

338
00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:33.130
from having four gigs of
Ram and two or four

339
00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:35.620
cores in our PDA, what
do I need a mobile

340
00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:37.930
OSTP for? I can run
windows. Yeah. I mean, if

341
00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:41.710
I love to have tiny
windows seven. Yeah. But cool.

342
00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:43.840
And plus a cradle, just
plug it into a regular

343
00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:47.230
screen and keyboard and off
you go. Yeah. So he

344
00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:49.290
suddenly you get this idea
of I'm no longer a

345
00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:52.050
USB key around with my
essential documents. I'm just carrying

346
00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:55.460
my machine. Okay. You think
it's going to happen? You

347
00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:57.770
think they were secretly working
on some tiny windows, seven

348
00:17:57.770 --> 00:18:00.290
thing. I don't know that.
I think anybody's particularly planning

349
00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:04.490
it, but I think it's
utterly inevitable. I'm now I'm,

350
00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:06.710
you know, I've got my
portable server rig, right? The

351
00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:08.630
bag with the little servers
in it. I mean, those

352
00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:11.630
are dual core. There's a
new board out now. Same

353
00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:13.970
form factor. It's a six
inch by six inch board.

354
00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:18.920
That'll run quad core and
16 gigs of Ram. Hmm.

355
00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:23.570
So tell me how this
can't happen. We have what

356
00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:26.360
I think we're struggling so
much with these different variations

357
00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:29.810
of OSS and platforms and
things. It's just easier to

358
00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:32.810
make the horsepower come to
the machine. Right? Like remember

359
00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:34.100
that, who is the one
that came up? The guy

360
00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:36.230
who came up with the
line that said it was

361
00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:38.360
easier to put internet everywhere
that it wasn't make a

362
00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:40.430
good disconnected client. And I
think the same thing is

363
00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:42.620
happening where it's easy rather
than trying to make a

364
00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:44.900
mobile OSTP it's efficient and
all those sorts of things.

365
00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:49.670
We're just going to bring
the horsepower everywhere. I don't

366
00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:53.120
know. But the, but again,
the power, Well, power consumption

367
00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:54.650
is always going to be
a challenge, but that's still

368
00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:57.770
in the hands of the
hardware guys. Arm is winning

369
00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:01.160
these days, you know, beating
out everybody else's processors because

370
00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:03.290
while they're giving us multi-course
and all these cool things,

371
00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:08.210
they're consuming power really efficiently.
Hey everybody, this is Scott

372
00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:10.760
coming at you from another
place in time. No doubt.

373
00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:13.220
You probably bumped into testing
tasks now, and then, and

374
00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:16.070
your work and, you know,
writing functional tests is probably

375
00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:18.440
not your favorite thing. It's
kind of difficult takes time

376
00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:20.840
and the results can be
dubious. Well, I'll get ready

377
00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:23.650
to start liking tests. Thanks
to Tellerik with the, the

378
00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:27.590
new web testing framework. Building
web automation test is a

379
00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:31.490
breeze. You've got code automation
with advanced asp.net, Ajax and

380
00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:34.160
server light applications. You can
write a single test, have

381
00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:37.670
it executed against multiple browsers
at once. You'd benefit from

382
00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:40.910
a rich API there's link
support integration with visual studio,

383
00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:44.210
unit testing, also end unit
X unit and NBA unit,

384
00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:47.660
not to mention the free
rappers for Telerik rad controls

385
00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:50.600
for ESPN, that Ajax and
several light, all shipping with

386
00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:54.020
Telerik's new testing tool. One
of the best features, the

387
00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:56.930
webinar testing framework, which is
developed by art of test

388
00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:01.400
is it's absolutely free. Freddie
got hooked on web testing

389
00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:04.670
framework, start using it right
away, go to tellerik.com for

390
00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:08.810
more info. Thanks a lot.
Why doesn't the iPhone and

391
00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:12.490
devices like it automatically shut
things on and off the

392
00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:14.540
joke about the iPhone is
that it's a great phone

393
00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:16.070
and it'll last for a
long time, as long as

394
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:18.800
it's off. Yeah. Or you
have to shut everything off

395
00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:22.010
and they haven't even in
the latest version, come up

396
00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:26.210
with a nice single dashboard.
There's like 22 clicks to

397
00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:30.020
get things shut off. Yeah.
I think that developers treat

398
00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:33.800
power consumption. Like they treat
security. That's somebody else's problem.

399
00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:37.010
I'll do it later. Whatever,
because when they're working on

400
00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:39.860
it, it's plugged in. It's
true. It's true. There's actually

401
00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:43.610
a lot of documentation on
how to write a good

402
00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:47.140
Microsoft application. That is a
smart power consumer. Yup. It

403
00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:49.780
can shut off pieces of
itself. You can turn off

404
00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:51.670
background threads. And you know,
I think that the only

405
00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:54.620
app that really does that
is his outlook about that.

406
00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:57.460
That knows that you're on
battery and thinks about what

407
00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:00.460
it can do to make
the battery life last longer

408
00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:04.560
And be less aggressive. But
heck you know, this is

409
00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:06.420
the big claim to fame
of the Mac book, right?

410
00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:09.120
Is you close the screen,
you open the screen, you

411
00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:12.660
still have a computer. I
defy you to find virtually

412
00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:15.930
any windows laptop that works
correctly on Well, I would,

413
00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:18.780
I would actually push back
and say that anyone not

414
00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:21.750
running windows seven. Cause that's
the, that's when I finally

415
00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:24.150
can call. I mean, seriously,
that's a, that's a really

416
00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:26.760
great example of the amount
of confidence. One can have

417
00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:28.830
in an iOS is that
if I can close it

418
00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:31.800
and not like do that,
you know, is the light

419
00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:35.730
in the refrigerator off yeah.
Thing. Then, then that's a

420
00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:40.290
sense of confidence. I totally
closed my Lenovo happily winning

421
00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:44.160
windows seven, without any concern
at all for, you know,

422
00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:46.230
what's going on, it will
shut off. It will shut

423
00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:47.670
off correctly and I will
be able to turn it

424
00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:49.800
back on and it will
work just fine. So my

425
00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:54.330
problem is I'm carrying a
motion computing, Ellie, 1700 slate

426
00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:57.000
tablet, and there is no
carrying that thing around. I

427
00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.420
am the battery life on.
It's absolutely Epic. I can't

428
00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:03.840
resist the thing. It's just
it's wonderful. But I did

429
00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:06.270
that. It was going into
shut down. I was in

430
00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:08.220
I'm still that Vista or
no, I put wind seminar

431
00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:10.620
C on it. I went
into a shutdown cycle. It's

432
00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:13.350
a shutting down. So I
stuffed in my bag and

433
00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:15.240
I pulled it out on
the airplane two hours later

434
00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:18.150
and it was still shutting
down and the battery and

435
00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:19.860
I'm like, Oh, well I
guess I don't have quite

436
00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:21.630
as much battery. And it
was just a bit tiny

437
00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:23.760
toasty being stuffed in the
bag while it was still

438
00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:26.850
shutting down. Yeah. You know,
I've heard things about laptops

439
00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:31.140
waking up for midnight bits
of work or backups or

440
00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:35.130
whatever, you know, midnight defrag
and then bursting into flame

441
00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:37.830
inside of a pack, a
backpack. I never had a

442
00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:41.430
machine burst into flame yet
since like the Apple two

443
00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:45.450
plus I burned up a
floppy drive by plugging the

444
00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:48.690
thing in wrong. That's not
good at all. Just a

445
00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:51.720
long time ago. Yeah. Okay.
Hey, I'm one of the

446
00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:54.380
things that you, you wanted
to talk about and you

447
00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:57.300
sent me a note about
was the idea of some

448
00:22:57.300 --> 00:23:00.340
of the big shows, the
big conferences and stuff are

449
00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:05.490
dying. You know, the downturn
impacted conferences across the board

450
00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:08.010
where everybody took a hit.
Right, right. And it's not

451
00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:10.170
easy. I don't envy anybody
in the conference business. And

452
00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:13.860
goodness knows we go to
lots of conferences, but you

453
00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:17.400
and I were together in
DC and in Norway, that

454
00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:19.950
was what, a scream of
a conference. Just a great

455
00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:22.680
story. Amazing. I mean, they
held the conference inside a

456
00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:25.050
soccer stadium cause it was
too big to be anywhere

457
00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:28.380
else. And even now they're
still struggling to keep the

458
00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:32.370
torrents up so people can
download the, the video of

459
00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:35.580
the talks. And this has
been what now? Four months.

460
00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:39.810
Yeah. Huge demands. So I
just got back about a

461
00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:41.880
couple of weeks back now.
I spent a weekend in

462
00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:45.410
Nashville at a conference called
DevLINK guy, runs it as

463
00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:49.220
volunteers. Name's John Keller, a totally
user group centric kind of

464
00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:53.720
show 700 people there. And
it had that buzz of

465
00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:58.010
a really happening excited conference.
People sitting in the hallways,

466
00:23:58.010 --> 00:24:01.070
chatting with each other, there
was an open spaces section

467
00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:03.980
that was really busy. I
did a couple of talks

468
00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:07.100
that were full. It just,
Carl was there with me.

469
00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:10.400
We did, we did@covid.net, rockstar,
closing with a panel discussion

470
00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:13.670
and all that sort of
thing. Nice. It felt like

471
00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:18.370
the big tier one shows
of old and When you

472
00:24:18.370 --> 00:24:21.850
could have 15,000 people and
have that same feeling. Yeah.

473
00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:24.040
But now you're saying it
was a big show, 700,

474
00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:26.650
700 people who paid a
hundred dollars a piece to

475
00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:29.880
be there. Why, what was
the formula? Was it a

476
00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:32.140
hundred dollars? Was it the
right 700 people? What made

477
00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:35.200
it awesome? I think, I
think you have a local

478
00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:37.090
draw. So there was really
a sense that everybody knew

479
00:24:37.090 --> 00:24:39.540
everybody. Like I was sort
of the forerunner there, there

480
00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:43.030
it's, but people drove it's
the Midwest. Right? So people

481
00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:45.250
drive a fair distance. They're
willing to, there's lots of

482
00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:48.310
folks in from Ohio and
from Michigan coming all the

483
00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:51.820
way down to Tennessee. I
think that's part of it

484
00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:55.300
was, it had a serious
community feel and it was

485
00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:57.850
on a, it was on
a university campus. So there

486
00:24:57.850 --> 00:25:01.060
was, and there was a
great hub of activity around

487
00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:03.820
coming and going from there.
But I think that you're

488
00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:06.940
growing the right people that
are really excited to be

489
00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:11.170
there. And really the expectations
are set. Well, I I've

490
00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:13.660
been reading another, I read
a book called the paradox

491
00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:17.500
of choice. Have you heard
of this book? I have

492
00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:19.030
heard of the book. It's
I think it's in my

493
00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:22.450
queue. My Amazon queue, absolute
wonder I'm reading free right

494
00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:26.320
now, which is that book
about freemiums interesting. One of

495
00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:28.840
the things that paradox choice
really gets into is this

496
00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:35.080
whole idea that your expectation
significantly affects your actual experience

497
00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:38.350
and the scenario they sort
of paint is suppose you're

498
00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:40.720
going to one of the
best restaurants in town and

499
00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:42.430
your friends have told you
it's the best meal you've

500
00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:44.770
ever had in your life.
And you've had a really

501
00:25:44.770 --> 00:25:47.710
great day and on and
on and on. So it's

502
00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:49.570
almost, or you feel sorry
for the chef, cause there's

503
00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:52.960
almost no way he could
meet your expectations. Even, even

504
00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:53.860
if we knock it out
of the park and does

505
00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:56.230
everything perfectly, it's only going
to meet your expectations, never

506
00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:59.680
going to exceed where it's
true. You walk into a

507
00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:02.890
restaurant after a terrible day
with no idea what the

508
00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:04.780
place is like. And the
guide is treats you nice

509
00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:06.400
and see it serves you
something half decent and you're

510
00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:09.340
happy. And I, I wonder
if the tier one shows

511
00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:14.680
got so big and so
expensive and so extravagant, we

512
00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:18.250
could never make our expectations
anymore. Well, plus there's the,

513
00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:21.010
the fog of war aspect
of things in the sense

514
00:26:21.010 --> 00:26:24.250
of, I remember that the
conferences were like this. Yeah.

515
00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:26.950
I don't know if they
were, you know, I remember

516
00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:31.660
15,000 people descending on Orlando
and everyone being awesome. And

517
00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:35.440
the parties being amazing and
counting crows was hired and

518
00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:38.380
they, they, they, they did,
they did the, the show

519
00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:42.220
a party. But I did,
I remember it Correctly. It

520
00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:44.730
was actually that was it
actually that good. You know,

521
00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:46.500
how long do we wait?
Cause you sort of edit

522
00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:48.660
out the, how long do
we wait for food we

523
00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:51.980
could get in. But I
think your point is really,

524
00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:54.200
is there an interesting people
it's actually made me think

525
00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:57.950
of, I always get teased
when I go overseas that

526
00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:01.940
even though I will try
crazy food, I always eat,

527
00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:06.740
try to eat subway or
some chain before a talk.

528
00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:09.890
Right, right. I'm not going
to go if I'm in

529
00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:12.050
Sweden, I'm not going to
go try Swedish food for

530
00:27:12.050 --> 00:27:14.810
the very first time, two
hours before I speak, it's

531
00:27:14.810 --> 00:27:16.910
just a bad idea. So
people are like, Oh my

532
00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:19.280
goodness, you went to Morocco
and you found a subway.

533
00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:22.280
What are you doing? You
know, subway sandwiches. Yeah. But

534
00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:25.070
it's, but it's my expectation,
which is that subway is

535
00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:27.890
subway pretty much everywhere in
the world. And that was

536
00:27:27.890 --> 00:27:29.840
in Toronto and I went
to subway and that was

537
00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:34.220
fantastic. Yeah. And I was
predictable opulence, you know what

538
00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:35.810
I mean? It was exactly
what I needed. But at

539
00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:38.600
the time, and I had
my expectations set appropriately and

540
00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:41.690
I had my subway sandwich
and it was comfort food.

541
00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:44.690
I had my expectation been
set in any other up

542
00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:48.170
or down, or if I
had no expectation at all,

543
00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:51.050
the psychic weight of the
stress, it would have put

544
00:27:51.050 --> 00:27:54.830
on me would have made
my talk a lesser talk.

545
00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:56.870
Yeah. And I think one
of the things we're seeing

546
00:27:56.870 --> 00:28:00.490
with these lightweight low cost
shows is when you are

547
00:28:00.490 --> 00:28:03.770
only in for a hundred
bucks, even if you get

548
00:28:03.770 --> 00:28:05.720
a decent lunch, you're probably
pretty happy. And if you

549
00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:07.670
get a couple of good
sessions and granted they can't

550
00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:10.760
pay the speakers. So this
gets back to that whole,

551
00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:12.920
you remember your video with
Ted about the death of

552
00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:15.860
the speaker, The death of
the professional speaker. That's a

553
00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:20.960
video up on channel nine.msdn.com
that Tim, Tim, Ted Neward

554
00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:25.220
right. Lamented the death of
the professional speaker. But when

555
00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:27.800
people's expectations are such that
I didn't have a huge

556
00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:30.170
commitment here when I don't
get a great talk. I'm

557
00:28:30.170 --> 00:28:33.860
like, ah, you know, you
get, that's fine. Where I

558
00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:35.420
think one of the concerns
you see this, I certainly

559
00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:37.460
see this online is folks
are saying, Hey, I spent

560
00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:41.000
$3,000 to go to this
top tier show flew all

561
00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.220
this way. Expensive hotel room
did dah, dah, dah, dah,

562
00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:46.970
and the talk still socked.
Hmm. So they, I think

563
00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:48.830
one of the reasons that
these little shows are doing

564
00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:52.220
so well is expectations are
reasonable and they're getting sufficient

565
00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:55.730
results for them. Well, does
that mean it's over for

566
00:28:55.730 --> 00:28:57.770
the big, the big conferences?
I mean, is it all

567
00:28:57.770 --> 00:29:00.350
about, you know, COVID mash
and these smaller regional conferences

568
00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:02.380
now? Well, what You asked
me about the regional conferences,

569
00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:04.490
I don't feel like they're
sustainable because there's no profit

570
00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:06.560
motive there. Those guys aren't
making any money on doing

571
00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:09.770
it. The love of it,
but love runs down my

572
00:29:09.770 --> 00:29:14.480
friend. They also find out
it's really Down. Yeah. That

573
00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:16.490
sounds like a country music
song. What does that mean

574
00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:20.240
Down? Eventually, you're going to
get this very hard work

575
00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:22.010
to put on a show
like that. Like if you

576
00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:23.420
could go to one of
these conferences, you've got to

577
00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:25.640
Pat those guys on the
back, but after a couple

578
00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:27.890
of three, four years of
doing this, they're going to

579
00:29:27.890 --> 00:29:32.120
be tired and, and wondering
why they're still doing it.

580
00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:34.100
And people do get critical
of these shows. It looks

581
00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:36.080
very hard to do so
to me it feels like

582
00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:40.100
they're not sustainable that eventually
these things will unravel unless

583
00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:45.190
they migrate a model that
is more, less individually centric.

584
00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:48.010
Right? I mean, obviously John Keller
was the center of DevLINK.

585
00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:50.800
You got guys like bill
Wagner and Diane Marsh. And it's

586
00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:53.840
a bunch of folks that
work on code mash and

587
00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:57.430
every show has got that
coupled one, two, three key

588
00:29:57.430 --> 00:30:00.460
people. When those people move
on, they, they ready to

589
00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:04.570
do something else. Can that
show sustain itself? And, and

590
00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:07.450
that's my concern is that
we may see this wave

591
00:30:07.450 --> 00:30:09.790
come in of this style
of show that then collapses

592
00:30:09.790 --> 00:30:13.330
under the weight of its
dependence on volunteerism to function.

593
00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:15.720
Yeah. Well, that's one of
the things that I think

594
00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:17.970
people can do when they
say, what do I do

595
00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:21.420
to get involved in community?
You know, the, there is

596
00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:24.660
often a personality or an
individual or a group of

597
00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:28.110
individuals, a brain trust that
keeps these things running. Whether

598
00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:31.050
they be your local dotnet
users' group or your local

599
00:30:31.050 --> 00:30:34.830
nerd dinner, or your local
a regional conference. And if

600
00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:39.150
you don't, if you don't
step up as a member

601
00:30:39.150 --> 00:30:40.860
of the community and help
out those things will just

602
00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:45.600
fade away. Absolutely Fred, whatever
Fred Fredrickson will decide, you

603
00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:47.370
know, I'm tired. I've been
doing this for five years.

604
00:30:47.790 --> 00:30:51.000
Let's, let's hand it over
to the community and then

605
00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:54.720
it just falls falling away.
It comes apart well. And

606
00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:56.520
I wonder if we're not
just in a cycle that,

607
00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:58.950
that the big shows got
a little too expensive and

608
00:30:58.950 --> 00:31:01.500
too opulent. And if they
lighten up a little and

609
00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:03.960
get a little less expensive
and get a little less

610
00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:08.370
Austin tasteless, as the cycle
comes around of these essentially

611
00:31:08.370 --> 00:31:11.700
volunteer shows spinning down. Again,
those people go, Hey, let's

612
00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:13.320
put on a big show.
I'm willing to spend a

613
00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:15.930
thousand dollars to get involved
in something like that. We'll

614
00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:18.630
see a resurgence of that,
but you know, there's another

615
00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:21.390
route. And I started, I've
had this experience in Europe

616
00:31:21.390 --> 00:31:25.110
where folks turn a user
group into almost a more

617
00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:29.460
formal organization. The dues go
up, there's a paid employee

618
00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:33.300
that operates that, that group.
And they do a conference

619
00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:35.040
every year. And again, it's
not necessarily, it's still a

620
00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:37.710
sort of a, it's a
not-for-profit. They spend all the

621
00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:40.860
money they bring in, but
there are people paid to

622
00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:44.370
operate it so that it's
sustainable longterm and not dependent

623
00:31:44.370 --> 00:31:47.610
on an individual or a
few individual volunteers to keep

624
00:31:47.610 --> 00:31:50.280
it running. And it becomes
a much more formal, not

625
00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:55.290
for profit organization. Hmm. I
wonder if Microsoft should Microsoft

626
00:31:55.290 --> 00:31:58.980
start doing mixed West and
mixed East and tech ed

627
00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:03.210
Southwest? I, you know, it's
an interesting question is the

628
00:32:03.210 --> 00:32:05.190
real question you've got to
ask is should Microsoft be

629
00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:07.320
in the conference business at
all? No, that's a very

630
00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:10.080
good question. But if, if
they, if they're not, then

631
00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:12.630
they have to count on
the, the, the, the local

632
00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:18.300
conferences, the regional conferences to,
to exist Well, and you

633
00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:21.090
know, you look at a
conference like DevLINK, and DevLINK

634
00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:23.670
had some sponsorship and I
don't necessarily know who all

635
00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:27.120
of them were, but they
re there were vendors out

636
00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:29.190
there who want to reach
that audience that were willing

637
00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:31.410
to contribute some money to
make the conference function. Why

638
00:32:31.410 --> 00:32:34.290
shouldn't Microsoft just be another
vendor in this scenario? Hmm.

639
00:32:34.290 --> 00:32:37.710
That's a good question. Yeah.
Support the small shows and

640
00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:39.500
you can support them in
so many ways. You do

641
00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:43.280
have the community connection and
you can provide some financial

642
00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:48.100
support as well as organizational
Support. I will. I'll take

643
00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:51.850
that feedback to them. Very
nice. Thank you. Carol says,

644
00:32:52.210 --> 00:32:53.720
no, I think you've got
a good point. I think

645
00:32:53.850 --> 00:32:59.380
that that smaller community run
sustainable conferences might energize people

646
00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:01.180
more than the, I mean,
I think that there should

647
00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:05.800
be probably one big con
Well, and again, you get

648
00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:08.860
back to, what is the
motivation here? Yeah. I remember

649
00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:12.790
hearing tech ed described to
me as the opportunity for

650
00:33:12.790 --> 00:33:15.730
Microsoft employees to get close
to their customers. And to

651
00:33:15.730 --> 00:33:17.980
me, that's a good idea
for Microsoft. And it's a

652
00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:20.650
good idea for the customers.
I don't know that it

653
00:33:20.650 --> 00:33:22.780
actually works, Works that way.
No, it doesn't work that

654
00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:25.480
way at all. But yeah,
That to me seems like

655
00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:27.100
a good idea. And I
also don't have a plan.

656
00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:30.580
So hang on, though, you're
saying that that, that someone

657
00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:33.340
described to you that the
tech ed was Microsoft's opportunity

658
00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:34.840
to get close to the
customer. We should be getting

659
00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:37.990
close to our customers well,
all the time. And certainly

660
00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:39.880
not just the ones that
can afford to fly somewhere

661
00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:42.230
and pay two grand to
do it. I mean, I

662
00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:44.170
don't disagree with you there
that you always need to

663
00:33:44.170 --> 00:33:46.810
be conduct your customers, but
it's sort of marquee event

664
00:33:47.170 --> 00:33:50.190
that is the big, you
know, big opportunity, you know,

665
00:33:50.190 --> 00:33:52.630
the, that every, you know,
all these folks inside of

666
00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:55.060
Microsoft that normally don't get
outside, get to get out

667
00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:58.780
there. And you have these
presentations, you know, to me,

668
00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:00.970
when I go to a
tech ed and admittedly, I

669
00:34:00.970 --> 00:34:03.250
presented tech ed, you presented
tech ed. So we've got

670
00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:05.290
our own biases anyway. But
when I go to a

671
00:34:05.290 --> 00:34:08.290
session, I go to a
session of a guy who

672
00:34:08.290 --> 00:34:11.170
is inside of Microsoft, who
built that technology. And it's

673
00:34:11.170 --> 00:34:12.820
going to tell you why
it works the way it

674
00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:16.060
works. You won't get that
information anywhere else. And that

675
00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:19.720
to me is valuable, right,
without a doubt. But what

676
00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:22.930
I worry about when Microsoft
puts on conferences is that

677
00:34:22.930 --> 00:34:26.620
it's suppressive of the community
based concept conference, that it

678
00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:30.280
overrides that conference because they
do have more money to

679
00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:32.770
spend and they are larger
and they quote are Microsoft,

680
00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:37.990
especially when those things tend
not to be sustainable. Often

681
00:34:37.990 --> 00:34:40.780
Microsoft gets into these ideas
and, you know, the local

682
00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:43.930
sub gets this idea of
doing this particular tour, doing

683
00:34:43.930 --> 00:34:46.270
these particular kinds of events.
And that only goes on.

684
00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:48.760
As long as that guy
is there, eventually he gets

685
00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:50.560
his promotion or moves on
to a different job and

686
00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:52.420
so forth. And it falls
apart. But in the two,

687
00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:56.290
three years that he did
his thing, the domestic stuff,

688
00:34:56.290 --> 00:35:00.010
the local stuff can't survive.
You know, it gets stepped

689
00:35:00.010 --> 00:35:01.900
on it. So suddenly we're
left with nothing. And that

690
00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:04.840
very frustrating to me that
we get into those circumstances.

691
00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:07.450
Right. And everybody loses in
the end. Yeah. What we

692
00:35:07.450 --> 00:35:10.720
really want is that sort
of consistent opportunity. I like

693
00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:12.310
the idea that I can
get together with my peers

694
00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:15.370
on a routine basis, in
a venue where we have

695
00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:17.470
a deep insight into the
different lines of products that

696
00:35:17.470 --> 00:35:19.630
we care about. And I
can talk to my peers

697
00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:21.580
about what's going on and
where we're going with it.

698
00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:25.870
I think you're onto something
I'm trying to be, but,

699
00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:27.430
you know, can we call
it? We can make it

700
00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:31.480
happen. We can call it
Campbell con Oh God. Yeah.

701
00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:34.210
You know, I want to,
I have a lot of

702
00:35:34.210 --> 00:35:36.730
respect for people who organize
conferences. I've worked with them

703
00:35:36.730 --> 00:35:38.670
enough, know that it's really
hard. I've done tons of

704
00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:40.350
content planning over the years.
I mean, in the, in

705
00:35:40.350 --> 00:35:42.690
dotnet rocks is really a
content planning exercise more than

706
00:35:42.690 --> 00:35:46.440
anything else. Totally. And, but
I would never want to

707
00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:48.170
be that guy to be
honest. Oh, well, yeah. I

708
00:35:48.170 --> 00:35:50.600
mean, just, it didn't a
known decks, right? That's Chris

709
00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:55.640
Portillo's thing. Yeah. Just, just
happened last weekend. And you

710
00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:57.380
know, and every once in
a while, when I'm kind

711
00:35:57.380 --> 00:35:59.870
of, you know, sitting on
my couch, rubbing my fat

712
00:35:59.870 --> 00:36:02.600
belly, watching TV, I think
to myself, why don't I

713
00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:08.000
have a con Okay. I
don't chance let's make Hansel

714
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.030
con and then I realized
that that Chris Prolo has

715
00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:16.100
boundless energy and organizational skills,
neither of which I possess.

716
00:36:16.130 --> 00:36:21.080
So then, then, Oh, look,
TV's on. So yeah. So

717
00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:24.080
the conference never actually happens.
Yeah. Dancing with the stars

718
00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:26.600
came on and the whole
thing went away. So you

719
00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:30.080
got to get people respect
if they have that, that

720
00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:32.210
kind of energy to pull
something together. Absolutely. He's a

721
00:36:32.210 --> 00:36:35.120
very special talent and, and
it's, it's fun to be

722
00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:38.600
a contributor to stuff like
that. But yeah, I never

723
00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:40.820
had an urge to own
it myself To own. It

724
00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:45.200
involves a special kind of
insanity On a level of

725
00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:48.200
maturity and reliability that I
have a tough time with.

726
00:36:50.210 --> 00:36:53.570
I'm glad that you, you
agree. I'm I'm South. Actually.

727
00:36:53.570 --> 00:36:55.130
You have no, you have
no business having a car

728
00:36:55.250 --> 00:36:57.650
I've been totally with you.
I've certainly learned to embrace

729
00:36:57.650 --> 00:37:01.370
my character defects for the
forces of good. Excellent. Excellent.

730
00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:07.760
Oh, it's so fun to
talk to you, Richard, Where

731
00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:10.040
you want to go next
to my friend. Where do

732
00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:13.310
I want to go next?
I I'm just learning how

733
00:37:13.310 --> 00:37:15.980
to be a boss right
now. Oh yeah. Tell me

734
00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:17.660
about this because I, that
was a heck of an

735
00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:21.080
announcement. And then, and now
you're trying to fill these

736
00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:23.600
to these roles. I mean,
congratulations for first and foremost,

737
00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:25.310
I don't know if it's
that big of a deal.

738
00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:29.330
The difference is that, you
know, before, when I led

739
00:37:29.330 --> 00:37:35.660
teams, it was more being,
being in charge of people

740
00:37:35.930 --> 00:37:38.360
implicitly. Right. So it's like,
you know, I'm running a

741
00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:41.600
team of, of three to
10 or whatever, but I

742
00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:47.870
wasn't doing their, their HR
stuff. Right. So there's the

743
00:37:48.830 --> 00:37:53.930
administrivia of being a boss.
Then there's the leadership part.

744
00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:58.520
You know, leadership is an
ongoing learning process and that's

745
00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:01.370
just something that you, that
you, that you do, the

746
00:38:01.370 --> 00:38:05.750
part I'm having trouble with
is the administrivia, it's just,

747
00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:09.380
it's the HR stuff and
the expense reports and all

748
00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:12.830
that kinda crap. Someone should
outsource that. There's gotta be

749
00:38:12.830 --> 00:38:15.320
a way to have somebody
else do that. It's just

750
00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:17.720
a better way to go
about that stuff. You don't

751
00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:22.280
get that until you're really,
really bossy boss, right. When

752
00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:26.390
you're like a VP of
something, right. Then suddenly, you

753
00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:29.900
know, other than what do
you call it? The yearly

754
00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:32.810
reviews, you don't have to,
you know, you have to

755
00:38:32.810 --> 00:38:35.920
provide leadership and do one-on-ones,
but I don't want to

756
00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:39.700
fill out a forms for
expenses and stuff like that.

757
00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:42.160
You know, if you've guys
spent five bucks on a

758
00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:45.660
subway sandwich, you know, more
power to you. Yeah. But

759
00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:48.360
isn't it your job just
to simply sign off that.

760
00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:50.490
Yeah. That's a, that's a
legitimate business. Okay. Yes. But

761
00:38:50.490 --> 00:38:52.440
even that is boring to
me. I mean, it's just,

762
00:38:52.650 --> 00:38:55.230
it's just like, you know,
those, the add those things

763
00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:56.880
up, right. You get four
or five guys working for

764
00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:58.620
you. And then when I
hire these other guys, I'll

765
00:38:58.620 --> 00:39:01.920
have like seven and it's
gonna mean half an hour,

766
00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:03.420
a week where I got
to go through the, you

767
00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:06.420
know, click, click, click approve,
approve. I just, I find

768
00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:11.490
that tedious, not value added
time. Right. Cause remember, I'm

769
00:39:11.490 --> 00:39:15.030
a guy that really tries
to keep track of what

770
00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:17.190
I'm doing and is it
valuable? And is it, is

771
00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:22.620
it time well spent? Interesting
problem. Isn't the hiring part

772
00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:25.020
of this, one of the
hardest Difficult. So that's funny

773
00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:27.720
that you mentioned that I
think I've blogged like nine

774
00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:31.380
or 10 times this, this
week. And it's, it's not

775
00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:33.450
this week rather, excuse me
this month. And it's really

776
00:39:33.450 --> 00:39:36.720
stressing me out because I'm
not doing what I want

777
00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:39.030
to be doing because I'm
so busy trying to hire

778
00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:42.810
somebody. Right. I mean, I've
got hundreds of resumes to

779
00:39:42.810 --> 00:39:45.150
sift through and I've got
some people who are supporting

780
00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:49.260
me in, in HR, but
they, they, they said they

781
00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:51.930
gave me a thing to
fill out that says, you

782
00:39:51.930 --> 00:39:53.550
know, give me the list
of keywords so that I

783
00:39:53.550 --> 00:39:56.760
can screen these resumes for
you. Ouch. It's like, yeah.

784
00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:59.670
Right. And that's, you know,
the kinds of community jobs

785
00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:03.030
that I am hiring for
it. This is not the

786
00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:06.300
way we're going to do
this. This, the person for

787
00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:08.280
this job is not going
to be found by looking

788
00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:11.610
for keywords. Yeah. No, these
are, yeah. This is a

789
00:40:11.610 --> 00:40:15.240
community thing. It's a very
personal kind of, Yeah. So

790
00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:16.860
I got to go through
it. I ask myself, so

791
00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:20.070
I've been spending all this
time doing this and not

792
00:40:20.370 --> 00:40:25.110
time, not the time I
want to be spending working

793
00:40:25.110 --> 00:40:26.310
on what I want to
be working on, which is

794
00:40:26.370 --> 00:40:29.520
ironically exactly what, what, what
Chris cells said was going

795
00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:31.890
to happen when he said
yes, you know, it's over

796
00:40:31.890 --> 00:40:34.380
for you and all productivity
in that, in the past.

797
00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:36.960
Yeah. Actually doing anyway. Well,
I remember that was back

798
00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:39.330
earlier in the month there
that, that Hansel minutes on

799
00:40:39.330 --> 00:40:42.630
nine just said, yeah, your,
your, your job now is

800
00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:44.550
to make everybody else productive.
Don't worry. You're not going

801
00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:47.430
to have any productive activity
yourself. Yeah. I, I, I'm

802
00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:51.350
still in denial. I refuse
to know. I just assume

803
00:40:51.350 --> 00:40:53.820
that's not, I have no
interest in being a manager.

804
00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:56.880
I would like to, I
want to be a role.

805
00:40:56.940 --> 00:40:58.770
I don't, I would like
to be an a and

806
00:40:58.770 --> 00:41:01.770
an enabler. I want to
be an empower and empowerer

807
00:41:02.190 --> 00:41:04.740
is that a word? Yeah.
And those are the things

808
00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:08.040
that I'm interested in doing.
So the idea of taking

809
00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:11.160
the role is so empower
these other guys that doesn't

810
00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:14.250
mean I want to stop
doing the stuff that I

811
00:41:14.490 --> 00:41:17.610
think I'm pretty decent at
doing. So the fi the

812
00:41:17.610 --> 00:41:20.340
trick is to find a
balance. Fortunately, these are senior

813
00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:22.770
guys. It's not like I'm
babysitting here. You know, I

814
00:41:22.770 --> 00:41:25.050
looked at your line full
of senior guys, so that's

815
00:41:25.050 --> 00:41:28.380
not a huge deal. It's
just the administrivia, it's just

816
00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:32.310
the, now I have a
regular weekly one-on-one with different

817
00:41:32.310 --> 00:41:34.550
people, and I've got to
fill out some forms and

818
00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:38.030
that's tedious. Plus when you're
a team, they want to

819
00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:42.470
know there's all sorts of
monthly status reporting to other

820
00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:44.810
bosses higher up. And again,
it all adds up to

821
00:41:44.810 --> 00:41:47.270
a couple of hours of
administrivia the problem with that

822
00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:50.510
is that it can add
up to a day if

823
00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:53.720
you're not paying attention. Right.
And I just, I can't

824
00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:59.070
accept a, a day of,
of admin work. Well, yeah.

825
00:41:59.410 --> 00:42:02.770
I used to measure my
productivity in interruptions per hour,

826
00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:06.460
recognizing that the higher, that
number was the less productive

827
00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:11.470
I was Interruptions per hour.
Yeah. I, well, I found

828
00:42:11.470 --> 00:42:14.290
that software development worked best
at an interruption per hour

829
00:42:14.290 --> 00:42:17.530
rate of 0.2, five, or
lower. So that means an

830
00:42:17.530 --> 00:42:20.290
interruption every four hours. That's
no more, any more than

831
00:42:20.290 --> 00:42:23.060
that in my productivity is
developer. Susan essentially goes down

832
00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:25.000
and I got so frustrated
with dealing with this in

833
00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.280
an office that I used
to hang my interruption per

834
00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:31.510
hour, number on the wall,
outside my office. And each

835
00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:33.610
time you phoned me, it
added to another interruption. It

836
00:42:33.610 --> 00:42:35.830
started when I had a
boss who, who had asked

837
00:42:35.830 --> 00:42:37.060
me to do a task
that I say, that's going

838
00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:38.380
to take me two hours
and then phone me every

839
00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:41.380
15 minutes on it. So
I started adding 15 minutes

840
00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:44.020
to the time, each time
he called, he says, yeah,

841
00:42:44.050 --> 00:42:46.090
I'll have that done by
two o'clock. Did he call

842
00:42:46.090 --> 00:42:48.760
back at, at, at, at
1130 and say, how's that

843
00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:50.140
coming? He says, I'll have
it done at two 30.

844
00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:53.320
You said two o'clock you
phoned again. And if you

845
00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:59.110
phone again, it'll be three
interruptions. And, but my point

846
00:42:59.110 --> 00:43:01.630
really being that as a
manager, you suddenly interruptions become

847
00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:03.430
a key part of your
day that you had started

848
00:43:03.430 --> 00:43:07.180
have to commit to interruption
heavy days and in exchange

849
00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:11.200
for, with any luck, getting
a low interruption day, Too.

850
00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:14.410
That would be that's nice.
Is it about controlling the

851
00:43:14.410 --> 00:43:17.920
people who could potentially interrupt
you or is it about

852
00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:20.740
just hiding? I think there's
a hiding element to it.

853
00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:24.700
I think there's not. There's
a effort to go into

854
00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:28.360
your office and eliminate interruptions,
like turning off email and

855
00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:30.700
setting D and D on
the phone, like those kinds

856
00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:32.590
of things, so that it's
not easy to interrupt you.

857
00:43:33.550 --> 00:43:35.620
Right? My whole point about
hanging that sign of my

858
00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:39.400
interruption rate was to make
people stop and think, do

859
00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:45.160
I want to interrupt him?
See, that's interesting. Last time.

860
00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:47.530
What was I talking about
this? I think it was

861
00:43:47.530 --> 00:43:50.290
a show recently. I was
talking about getting an, a

862
00:43:50.290 --> 00:43:53.920
big on air sign, like
an old style radio on

863
00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:56.740
air sign. Yes. And a
bunch of people said, you

864
00:43:56.740 --> 00:43:59.050
can get them on eBay.
I've seen by building one.

865
00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:01.660
I don't want to spend
too much money, but the

866
00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:04.840
boys, as they interrupted earlier
on the show here, tend

867
00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:08.470
to kind of launch themselves
at the door. You know,

868
00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:11.290
nothing is scarier. If you
have any kind of zombie

869
00:44:11.290 --> 00:44:14.590
issues about, you know, two
toddlers throwing their shoulder into

870
00:44:14.590 --> 00:44:17.950
the door, I sit, they're
not, they're not looking for

871
00:44:17.950 --> 00:44:24.220
brains, daddy. Hey dad. Hey.
So I'm thinking that a

872
00:44:24.490 --> 00:44:27.970
blinking light that says on
air, right? We'll, we'll clearly

873
00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:32.070
get the children Not go
because that's really what it

874
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:35.640
Says anyway, isn't it? You
know, do I really want

875
00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:38.160
a blinking sign that says
go away, flashing over my

876
00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:41.190
door? Maybe I do. Actually.
I was just thinking in

877
00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:43.560
the whole zombie scenario thing,
the good news is you

878
00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:45.750
could aim a shotgun at
the mid door. So if

879
00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:47.670
it is a zombie, you'll
get him in the head.

880
00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:49.110
But if it's a toddler,
it's going to go below

881
00:44:49.110 --> 00:44:51.630
him anyway. But the explosion
is going to be enough

882
00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:53.130
to probably make them think,
should I really hit that

883
00:44:53.130 --> 00:44:57.870
door again? Wow. I think
that we should stop the

884
00:44:57.870 --> 00:45:00.660
talk now, because that was
perfect. That was the perfect

885
00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:06.810
ending. Bothered at work. Got
a home office, try a

886
00:45:06.810 --> 00:45:09.930
shotgun just higher than a
toddler's head. There you go.

887
00:45:10.290 --> 00:45:13.500
Wire that up to your
phone system. You know, you'll

888
00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:15.900
very likely to be prototyping
this later. Good day. Yes.

889
00:45:15.930 --> 00:45:18.180
Just push the blue button
and say, reduce my interruptions

890
00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:22.110
per hour. Shotguns deploy automatically,
probably over the head of

891
00:45:22.110 --> 00:45:24.660
the children. There you go.
All right. Well, Richard, thank

892
00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:27.060
you so much for hanging
out. Always a pleasure, sir.

893
00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:29.280
We'll do it again sometime.
Alright. Well, this has been

894
00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:32.400
another episode of Hanselminutes and
we'll see you again next

895
00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:32.580
week.
