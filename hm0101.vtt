Michio Kaku. Hi, this is

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.110
Scott Hanselman, and this is
another episode of Hansel minutes.

11
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.570
In fact, our 101st episode,
and we are sitting here

12
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.050
backstage at Microsoft Tegrity six
and fortunate enough to get

13
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.110
a moment to sit down
with dr. Michio Kaku, who

14
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.050
is the author of physics
of the impossible coming out

15
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.030
very, very soon. He'll be
starting his book tour, and

16
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.600
he is a theoretical physicist
cofounder of string field theory

17
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:29.880
and futurist. Thank you very
much, sir, for taking the

18
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.640
time glad to be here.
So your new book is

19
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.890
really interesting. It's about the
impossible made possible. There are

20
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.700
so many things that are
considered impossible, like in visibility,

21
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:49.110
teleportation starships Reagan's time travel.
And we visited us actually

22
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.330
believe that some of them
may be possible in the

23
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.900
coming decades, centuries, or even
millennia. They don't violate the

24
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.060
laws of physics. So I
wanted to write a book

25
00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.320
taking apart, taking apart each
of these so-called impossible technologies,

26
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.990
showing that in the future,
we may very well have

27
00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.540
them. Our descendants may have
them who isn't there a

28
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.260
rule in physics that if
something is not disallowed and

29
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.050
it is mandatory, that's right.
There's a famous rule. If

30
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.010
it's not forbidden, it's mandatory.
So we do believe that

31
00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.910
it may be possible to
make an object invisible, perhaps

32
00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.710
within a few decades, teleportation,
we can already teleport photons

33
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.460
and cesium atoms starships maybe
in the next century. So

34
00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.130
I try to quantify some
of these things. So what

35
00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.830
was it about teleportation in
the last 10 years that

36
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.750
has just been leaps and
bounds? I mean, 15, 20

37
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.120
years ago, you started talking
about teleportation. You'd be laughed

38
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.120
off the stage. Now we're
teleporting things every day. That's

39
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.940
right. In fact, businesses even
came up with rules saying

40
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.370
that you would violate quantum
theory to have an object

41
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.090
teleport. Ironically enough, we use
the quantum theory to teleport

42
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.050
photons and cesium atoms regularly.
The world's record is to

43
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.320
teleport a cesium atom under
the Danube river, as well

44
00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.990
as photons. And we hope
to perhaps teleport the first

45
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:07.510
molecule, perhaps within five, 10
years. And there are some

46
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.520
bedding that maybe within 20
years, we may be able

47
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.140
to teleport viruses and organic
molecules. How do you measure

48
00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.520
something like that? How do
you prove that you in

49
00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.620
fact did it and you
didn't just blink and miss

50
00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.710
it? Well, we have laser
beams that we know that

51
00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.590
for example, the polarization or
the information contained in an

52
00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.320
object, and then we have
another object on the other

53
00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.800
side of the Daniel river
and we teleport that information.

54
00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.730
So you actually destroy the
original, the information is then

55
00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.000
carried over to this other
object. So captain Kirk, for

56
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.790
example, would be destroyed in
the process, but he would

57
00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.630
rematerialize someplace else. Where is
he being stored? He's being

58
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.070
stored in something that we're
used to, or is he

59
00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.460
being stored somewhere in a
quantum State? We use what

60
00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.730
is called quantum entanglement. Believe
it or not. If two

61
00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.910
objects are brought very close
together, they're wave functions, sort

62
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.490
of merge. They sort of
become like twins. And so

63
00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.400
when you separate them, there's
an umbilical cord and invisible

64
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.760
in biblical cord separating these
two. And if you jiggle

65
00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.630
one, the other one jiggles
passed within the speed of

66
00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.690
light Einstein didn't like this,
but Hey, we've tested it

67
00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.270
in the laboratory. And it
really does work. It's very

68
00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.450
interesting. This idea of proximity
affecting so many things. You

69
00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.510
talk about time, travel and
fundamental to that is bringing

70
00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.910
two things that are very
large, very close together, but

71
00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.110
not touching That's right. Many
times in theoretical physics, we

72
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.020
stretch the boundaries of what
is known and not known.

73
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.810
For example, I used to
teach on my optics course

74
00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.580
that invisibility is impossible, light
bends in glass water. We

75
00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.770
know how to bends and
you cannot make an object

76
00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.790
invisible. Well, last year at
Imperial college, London and Duke

77
00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:46.170
university in North Carolina, we actually
made objects invisible to microwave

78
00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.990
radiation, think of a rock
in the middle of a

79
00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.190
stream, water flows around the
rock. So that downstream you

80
00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.140
don't even know that there
was a rock I'm stream.

81
00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.580
Now replace the water with
light light can bend around

82
00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.180
an object, which we used
to think was impossible reform

83
00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.090
to make the object invisible.
Now just a few months

84
00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.700
ago, we did it with
the proof of principle was

85
00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.520
done in the optical range
with red lasers and green

86
00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.820
lasers. So I would say
that within five, 10 years,

87
00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.640
we may be able to
make an object invisible, at

88
00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.550
least to one color. Interesting.
Now are these kinds of

89
00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.870
things happening from within or
from without, I mean, is

90
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.390
the person making the object
going to have a pack

91
00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.370
or is this going to
be an external force acting

92
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.070
upon the arm? Sure. I
think of the invisibility cloak

93
00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:35.550
of Harry Potter. We're never going
to be that advanced, but

94
00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.760
for example, the Pentagon is
funding. This, the Pentagon may

95
00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.280
have a tank and then
put a cylinder, a cylinder

96
00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.640
around the tank so that
when light hits the cylinder,

97
00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:47.940
it follows the cylinder and
emergency to the other end

98
00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.140
so that the tank is
invisible. So the Pentagon has

99
00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:55.380
spent billions of dollars on
stealth technology. Stealth makes you

100
00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:59.270
invisible to radar, but is
quite visible to light. You

101
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:02.720
can see a stealth bomber
with your naked eye. So

102
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.720
in the future, the stealth
bomber may actually disappear. That's

103
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.710
the goal of the Pentagon.
Anyway, That just makes me

104
00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:11.350
think of predator because he
was invisible, but there was

105
00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:13.630
just a shimmer just to
a flaw. The eye is

106
00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:16.090
so good at telling when
something is not right. That's

107
00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:18.940
the goal. The goal is
to make an object invisible

108
00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.370
so that maybe it was
a little glimmer as the

109
00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:25.060
person walked by. Interesting. Now
within the context of, of

110
00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.370
Reagan's and lasers, I know
that the army and a

111
00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:30.130
number of riots police already
have microwave emitting lasers that

112
00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:32.740
will make your skin feel
like you're on fire. So

113
00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.350
use it for riot control
and crowd control. Yeah. You

114
00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:37.630
know, people often ask the
question, we have laser beams,

115
00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.940
we can drill a hole
through a brick wall with

116
00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:42.760
a laser beam. So why
don't we have handheld Ray

117
00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.910
guns that you see in
star Wars? Well, the answer

118
00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:50.170
is very mundane, but very
interesting. There are no handheld

119
00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:53.290
power packs, big enough, powerful
enough to be placed in

120
00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:56.830
your hand. That's the reason
we can build the gun.

121
00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:00.220
That'll blast through steel blast
through brick, just like you

122
00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:02.320
see in the movies, the
problem is you need a

123
00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.870
nuclear power plant or the
other side to energize it.

124
00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:08.710
So it's not very practical.
We need a power Pang

125
00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:11.260
that you can put in
your hand. It seems that

126
00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:14.590
with the movement towards green
and energy and ecology, you

127
00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:17.280
know, being responsible as, as,
as we, you know, in

128
00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:19.330
Microsoft work on technologies that
are going to be more

129
00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:22.960
energy efficient. There is this,
perhaps this is already happening.

130
00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.540
There's there's this power science
field that is just gonna

131
00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:27.970
become so fundamentally important. I
mean, I can't keep my

132
00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:30.670
laptop going for more than
two hours. How do I

133
00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:32.860
expect to get a Reagan
and put a well, Hopefully

134
00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:37.540
we can use nanotechnology technology
is the technology of individual

135
00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:41.020
atoms. Right now we can
build an atomic Abacus and

136
00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:44.500
advocates made of individual atoms.
We can make an atomic

137
00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:48.220
guitar, but not much else.
We cannot make atomic ball,

138
00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:51.850
bearings, levers, pulleys, and gears.
But one day we will,

139
00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:55.090
we'll build an entire atomic
factory. That's a size smaller

140
00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:58.300
than a cell. And so
we think that with nanotechnology,

141
00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:00.820
we may be able to
solve many problems that we

142
00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:03.940
can solve today. For example,
think of a star ship.

143
00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:07.690
You think of captain Kirk
in a gigantic enterprise, and

144
00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:10.330
you just do the mathematics.
The cost will be enormous

145
00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:12.910
to send that near the
speed of light, nothing of

146
00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:16.570
a nano ship, billions of
nano ships, each one, a

147
00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:19.780
computer that you then send
with an electric field near

148
00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:23.140
the speed of light, billions
of them to the nearest

149
00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:25.600
star. Most of them never
make it, but a few

150
00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.910
of them will make it
to the nearest star. And

151
00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:30.010
when they come back, you
can get all the information

152
00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:33.640
you want because of nanotechnology.
So nano ships are being

153
00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:37.900
looked at by NASA. It's
a completely new paradigm. And

154
00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:41.650
again, nanotechnology makes us possible.
I should also point out

155
00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:46.150
the NetApp technology may also
save Microsoft and Silicon Valley.

156
00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:50.200
Eventually Silicon power will be
exhausted. We're going to enter

157
00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:54.910
the post Silicon era. Silicon
is not stable, electronically speaking

158
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:57.990
at the atomic level. So
they're useless as we begin

159
00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:00.900
to etch on to individual
atoms, transistors, as small as

160
00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:04.770
atoms. So Silicon Valley could
become a rust belt unless

161
00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:08.790
we physicists use nanotechnology to
create quantum computers rather than

162
00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:11.630
Silicon computers. No, I've heard
of the context of quantum

163
00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:14.540
effects. We're reaching a point
where Silicon is so small

164
00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:16.880
that we're starting to have
side effects. As things bump

165
00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.460
into things, how is moving
to nanotechnology, gonna make that

166
00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:21.980
easier? There are two problems
with Moore's law. Moore's law

167
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:25.730
says the computer power doubles
every 18 months, but George Harrison

168
00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:30.500
said, all things must pass.
Even Moore's law by 2020,

169
00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:33.200
we're going to be bumping
up right up against Moore's

170
00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:37.130
law. Two reasons. One is
heat generation. These chips will

171
00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:40.850
generate so much heat. They'll
melt the melt themselves. You

172
00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:42.680
can fry an egg on
a Pentium chip of the

173
00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:45.560
future. Second of all, a,
your Pentium chip has a

174
00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.740
layer 20 items across today
by 2020, it will be

175
00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:52.040
five items across at that
point. Leakage takes place. You

176
00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.780
don't know who the electron
is, and I think short

177
00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:57.470
circuits. Hmm. Hm. Hm. So
if things are continuing to

178
00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:00.080
get smaller than nanotechnology context,
how is that not a

179
00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.270
problem? I mean, where's the
where I don't sure where

180
00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:05.960
the is. Well, the problem
is mass production and wiring

181
00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:08.750
of these things. We can,
let's say build a transistor

182
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:11.630
made out of individual atoms,
transistors, just nothing but a

183
00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:14.390
gate. However, how do you
mass produce it? How do

184
00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:17.450
you wire? It they're so
tiny. You can't see it,

185
00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:20.540
you blow on it and
thing, you know, just disappears.

186
00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:24.950
So mother nature solve these
problems. 3 billion years ago. It's

187
00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:28.340
called DNA. It's called the
nucleus of the cell is

188
00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:32.180
called a cell. We're trying
to duplicate many of the

189
00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:35.900
ingenious devices at the nanoscale.
The nature saw 3 billion years

190
00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:38.960
ago. It's interesting, more and
more I'm seeing that scientists

191
00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.480
are looking at nature to
solve their problems, rather than

192
00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:44.060
trying to build a heart
from scratch. We take an

193
00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:47.240
existing heart. We reduce it
down to its scaffolding, which

194
00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:49.790
they've just recently done with
rat hearts. And then tell

195
00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:51.920
it to build itself back
up by seeding it with

196
00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:54.890
an individual skin That's right,
right. At the present time,

197
00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:58.550
we can create from your
own cells, skin, bone, heart

198
00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:04.490
valves, noses, ears bladders, and
within five years, the first

199
00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:08.900
liver within maybe five, 10
years, the first pancreas. So

200
00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:11.120
these are your own cells
that are grown in a

201
00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:15.320
mold and are scaffolding. And
then it creates a human

202
00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:18.890
body shop. Just like your
auto body shop, replaces body

203
00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:22.130
automobile parts in case of
an accident in case you

204
00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:25.580
age or have a disease,
we will grow new organs

205
00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:27.980
of the body. Now your
new book, physics of the

206
00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:30.020
impossible is coming out very,
very soon. Or what are

207
00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:32.600
some of the other fantastic
technologies that are out there

208
00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:37.100
Like time travel. I talk
about things that are impossible

209
00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:40.010
that may be possible within
10, 20, a hundred years.

210
00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:43.760
These are called class one,
impossibilities like Reagan's and star

211
00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:49.670
ships and invisibility shields teleportation,
but a class two impossibilities

212
00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:55.090
require thousands of years. For
example, time wormhole faster than

213
00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:59.980
like rocket ships. These were
require much more time because

214
00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:03.130
we would have to assemble
energy comparable to a star.

215
00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:06.450
Now we can't do that
yet. And this is your

216
00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:09.150
classification class one, two and
three That's right in class

217
00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:14.100
three impossibilities are impossible with
the known laws of physics,

218
00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:18.300
such as for example, reading
the future and perpetual motion

219
00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:22.410
machines. They probably violate all
known laws of physics. Interesting.

220
00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:25.830
I saw the reading, the
future coming. I didn't think

221
00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:29.190
that perpetual motion would be,
I guess that would, Yeah.

222
00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:31.140
When I was a graduate
store to get my PhD,

223
00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:33.330
I was really bowled over
and fell off my chair.

224
00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:37.230
When I finally realized the
reason why conservation of energy

225
00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:40.380
is true. If I have
a system that does not

226
00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:44.580
change with time, then if
the laws of physics don't

227
00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:48.990
change with time, then the
system conserves energy, physical nervous

228
00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:51.900
there. That's the reason why
energy is conserved. The laws

229
00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:55.230
Newtonian physics does not change
with time. Quantum physics has

230
00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:58.380
not changed with time. You
can get radiation emitted from

231
00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:01.590
the big bang. The radiation
is identical. The radiation we

232
00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:04.620
see on the earth microwave
radiation. So the laws of

233
00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:07.830
physics haven't changed in 13.7
billion years We've yet. We

234
00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:09.810
just discovered them to be
different than we thought they

235
00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:13.350
were. Yeah. So it means
that the conservation of energy

236
00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:16.440
has probably held for 13.7
billion years. This is a

237
00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:19.200
stunning revelation that just blew
my mind away. When I

238
00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.330
was a graduate student, getting
my PhD, who are we

239
00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:24.180
to change it? Ah, yeah,
you have to go to

240
00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:27.150
before the big bang to
alter the laws of physics

241
00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.340
and axial. That's what I
do for a living. I

242
00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:32.100
work and something called string
theory, where we actually do

243
00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:35.790
go before the big bang.
We go before Genesis and

244
00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:38.850
we talk about a multi-verse
of universes, but that's another

245
00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:42.090
book. My book parallel worlds
talks about the multi-verse of

246
00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:45.420
universities. Well, I remember my,
when in 1995, when I

247
00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:48.360
read hyperspace for the first
time, the idea that here

248
00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:53.100
was someone, some context, some
topic that was in my

249
00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:56.280
mind, originally inaccessible, it was
being brought to me. And

250
00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:57.900
it was the first time
that I'd sat down with

251
00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:00.330
a popular science book, other
than some, you know, Carl

252
00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:03.990
Sagans books. And it was
such a powerful experience to

253
00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:05.970
be able to, to have
that come down to me

254
00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.030
in the sense that I'm
not a PhD student at

255
00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:11.940
the city university of New York.
And I really appreciate that,

256
00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:14.820
that book. So talk to
me more about time travel

257
00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.820
Well to build a time
machine. And I give a

258
00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:20.730
blueprint in the book, you'd
have to assemble the energy

259
00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:24.420
comparable Vento, but have a
star create a gigantic Adam

260
00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:27.420
smasher that converges all the
energy to a single point,

261
00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:31.200
sufficient to open up a
gateway through space and time.

262
00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:34.430
The problem is however paradox
is what happens. If you

263
00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.990
go backwards in time and
kill your parents before you

264
00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:39.900
were born. If you kill
your parents before you're born,

265
00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:42.210
how can you be born
to kill your parents before

266
00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:45.390
you're born grandfather paradise? Right?
And the answer to that

267
00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:49.890
is the universe probably splits
in half time is a

268
00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:52.700
river. We think Einstein said
the river can speed up

269
00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:55.730
or slow down, but the
river of time may have

270
00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:59.960
whirlpools. The river of time
may have forks forks in

271
00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:03.710
the river of time. So
maybe a parallel universe opens

272
00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:07.730
up. And as a consequence
you killed, when you went

273
00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:10.130
back into the past, you
kill someone who looks like

274
00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:13.760
your father and mother, but
they're not. They're genetically identical,

275
00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:17.290
but there are a parallel
mother and father Now is

276
00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:19.810
that by virtue of the
fact that you went back

277
00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:22.570
in time or is every
decision, every moment, every atom

278
00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:26.500
split, every Dick electronic cake
causing a new universe has

279
00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:29.560
put off. Well, there is
a theory called many worlds

280
00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:31.390
and believe it or not,
it is one of the

281
00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:34.420
dominant theories of the quantum
theory. At the present time,

282
00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:38.170
we says that the universe
splits every time a decision

283
00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:41.290
or a measurement has been
made. So there are carbon

284
00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:45.130
copies of you existing in
billions of universities, where you

285
00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:48.700
marry somebody different. You went
to a different college, became

286
00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:52.570
a mass murderer instead of
an upstanding citizen or died

287
00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:56.320
in infancy. And in these
other universes, Elvis Presley is

288
00:15:56.320 --> 00:16:00.910
still alive. Now this does
that mean that we are

289
00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:03.430
in the most probable universe
or are we just simply

290
00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:06.670
we're in this one? According
to the quantum theory, we

291
00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:09.910
haven't to be in one
universe among many, many possible

292
00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:13.840
universes. Ours is very likely
the probability that we are

293
00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:17.320
sitting here having this conversation,
that's quite large, but there's

294
00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:19.540
also a probability that my
wave function is on Mars

295
00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:22.450
right now. And that tomorrow
I'll wake up on the

296
00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:25.720
red planet. I asked my
graduate students to calculate their

297
00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:28.750
probability. You'll wake up on
Mars. The next day. You

298
00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:30.520
will have to wait longer
than the lifetime of the

299
00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:34.180
universe, but it's, It is.
And there is a non

300
00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:37.960
zero possibility. That's right. You
can calculate the probability that

301
00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:40.450
you will wake up on
Mars tomorrow. Now a lot

302
00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:42.790
of our listeners are our
computer. People were programmers and

303
00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:45.670
we're typically doing business applications,
but I'm interested in what

304
00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:48.190
kinds of computer systems are
you using? Are you using

305
00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:50.830
Mathematica to do this work?
What kind of programming are

306
00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:53.110
you doing to theorize? Or
are you just a Blackboard

307
00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:55.780
guy? Okay. You're not going
to believe this, but we

308
00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:58.300
physicists work with the mathematics
that cannot be placed on

309
00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:01.750
a computer. Okay. People say,
well, everything can be placed

310
00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:04.480
on a computer, right? The
universe is a computer. Yeah.

311
00:17:04.570 --> 00:17:08.410
Wow. We work with advanced
calculus with what are called

312
00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:13.780
super manifolds in hybrid space.
And computer is, can calculate.

313
00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:16.450
They can't function in that
realm, the universe that I

314
00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:19.540
work in. And so we
have to use pencil and

315
00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:24.550
paper. And basically we stare
out the window imagining what

316
00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:27.400
surfaces look like in 11
dimensional hybrid space that are

317
00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:31.480
super, super manifolds. Computers cannot
work the super numbers. You

318
00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:35.140
know that one times two
is, is too right. But

319
00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:38.170
one times two does not
equal two times one, but

320
00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:40.510
with super numbers, one times
two does not equal two

321
00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:44.440
times one. And yet all
our mathematics is based on

322
00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:48.760
super numbers. That's why it's
called super string theory. And

323
00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:51.770
these can not be placed
our computers. How much of

324
00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:55.760
this is done with raw
horsepower of the mind or

325
00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:58.850
versus intuition? How much do
you feel? Almost all of

326
00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:02.870
it is done with intuition
mainly because the mathematics, a

327
00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:05.930
computer is useless for us.
Very few of my friends

328
00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:08.810
use Mathematica unless we have
a long, long calculation that

329
00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:11.570
we have to do. Basically
we stare out the window

330
00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:15.710
and play with equations. I
assume at this point, after

331
00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:17.630
being, having done it for
25, 30 years, you can

332
00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:19.940
just do this in your
head. Yeah. Most of the

333
00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:22.520
time I share out the
window. Now my wife thinks

334
00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:24.410
that's very strange. Cause I'm
staring out the window all

335
00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:26.930
the time, playing with equations,
drifting in my head. But

336
00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:28.880
all my friends do this.
All my friends who work

337
00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:31.190
on string theory stare out
the window. It's like a

338
00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:36.440
musician, a musician has melodies
in his head and plays

339
00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:39.770
with his melodies. And that's
what we do. That's interesting.

340
00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:42.560
One of the characteristics of
the computer person is the

341
00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:47.030
often a lack of attention
or, and, and a lack

342
00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:49.610
of attention to the ability
to just literally zone out,

343
00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:52.490
go completely away. And I,
it seems to be people

344
00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:54.530
are either one or the
other. They either have add,

345
00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:58.850
or they are hyper attentive.
Well, to be a theoretical

346
00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:00.590
physicist, you have to be
able to sit on your

347
00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:04.760
butt for hours at a
time. Look at Newton. Newton

348
00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:09.650
spent 18 months basically locking
himself in his room, working

349
00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:13.040
out the greatest masterpiece in
the history of science. 18

350
00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:16.400
months locked up. Einstein spent
several months working on general

351
00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:19.700
activity. He lost something like
20 pounds working on general

352
00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:22.610
relativity. The stress on his
body was so great. That's

353
00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:25.730
what it takes. How often
do you, is this, is

354
00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:28.250
this often a solitary situation?
Or can you sit down

355
00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:32.240
and stare at the window
with a friend? Sometimes we

356
00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:35.750
talk to each other. We
collaborate on papers. One time

357
00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:38.420
a student of mine was
listening in on the conversation.

358
00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:41.900
And she said that while
every word was English, when

359
00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:44.600
you put all these words
together, it meant nothing. Absolutely

360
00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:49.040
nothing. We use shorthand, shop,
talk, shop, talk to, to

361
00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:52.700
express whole blocks of equations.
So when we talk to

362
00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:55.400
each other, it's English, but
it's a short hand for

363
00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:57.710
equations Putting it on the
spot here. But can you

364
00:19:57.710 --> 00:19:59.120
give me kind of an
example? Cause I know how

365
00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:01.520
I would explain, you know,
C sharp and.net programming to

366
00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:03.230
my wife. And she would
agree that it is English,

367
00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:05.600
but I have no idea
what you're saying. Well, for

368
00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:08.180
example, if we're up in
Columbia manifolds, where we work

369
00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:11.330
with so-called index theorems, we
have to be able to

370
00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:15.920
calculate the different index theorems
for different manifolds in hyperspace.

371
00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:19.070
And these are super manifolds
that exist, not just at

372
00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:22.760
11 dimensional space, but 32
dimensional space. So altogether a

373
00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:25.100
43 dimensional space is what
we have to work with.

374
00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:29.270
And it's not something that
you can teach it. That's

375
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:32.570
interesting. So in thinking in
the context of children, I

376
00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:34.280
have a two year old,
and I'm wondering when you

377
00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:37.130
begin to teach someone the
basics and the kind of

378
00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:40.790
the general math, how quickly
do people who are natural,

379
00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:43.760
theoretical physicists, do they get
up to speed and immediately

380
00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:46.400
move beyond? Is this something
that you found by 10,

381
00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:49.210
15, you were, You were
done and you rated them

382
00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:52.840
a different philosophy. I think
it's more a question of

383
00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:57.310
interest rather, rather than innate
ability. I think by the

384
00:20:57.310 --> 00:20:59.620
age of 10, I've interviewed
a lot of scientists of

385
00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:02.350
my time. I have my
own radio show. I'm on

386
00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:06.130
130 radio stations around the
country. And every time I

387
00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:08.110
interview a scientist, I ask
him, how did you get

388
00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:12.100
interested in science? They always
say the same thing. When

389
00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:16.090
I was 10, it was
a telescope, it was a

390
00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:20.200
chemistry kit. It was a
planetarium visit. That's what set

391
00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:24.370
them off. And then by
the time they read 16,

392
00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:28.900
it's all over. They discover
girls, peer pressure kicks in.

393
00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:32.920
You lost him. So you
have six golden years from

394
00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:36.760
10 to 16 to get
them hooked on science for

395
00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:40.450
the rest of their life.
If you miss it. Well,

396
00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:44.620
maybe they'll discover it later.
That's amazing that that's exactly

397
00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:46.480
what happened to me with
computers. And now I have

398
00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:48.100
to wait eight years for
my two year old to

399
00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:50.530
be ready to become a
theoretical physicist. That's right. So

400
00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:53.320
when your kids hit 10,
take them to the planetarium,

401
00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:57.310
like computer games with them,
read science books, astronomy books,

402
00:21:57.310 --> 00:22:00.790
planetariums, because that's when they
realized that mommy and daddy

403
00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:03.700
are not the universe before
10, everything is mommy and

404
00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:06.490
daddy after 10, they say,
well, how big is the

405
00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:09.010
universe? And it freaks them
out when they realize how

406
00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:11.410
big the world really is.
That's when you got to

407
00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:13.870
grab them. Because like I
said, you know, your hormones

408
00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:17.350
kick in by 16, 17
peer pressure. People say, you're

409
00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:19.510
a nerd, you're a geek.
You know, you're a loser,

410
00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:21.880
blah, blah, blah. And it's
over. You got to get

411
00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:23.650
them during those years. Is
that what happened to you?

412
00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:26.080
Did your parents hook you
up with something? Well, my

413
00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:28.990
parents were very poor and
so I knew that I

414
00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:31.750
had to make it on
my own. No one was

415
00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:35.230
gonna give me something on
a silver platter. And so

416
00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:37.030
I knew that I had
to do something on my

417
00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:38.650
own. So I built an
atom smasher. When I was

418
00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:42.850
in high school, I built
the 2.3 million electron volt,

419
00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:47.350
beta Tron, particle accelerator, my
garage. Did anyone was anyone

420
00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:50.350
hurt? No, but it blew
out every single circuit breaker

421
00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:53.260
in the house. My mother
kept saying, why can't you

422
00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:55.750
date a nice Japanese girl?
Why don't you, why do

423
00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:57.670
you build these things? How
did you do this? Was

424
00:22:57.670 --> 00:22:59.680
this a radio shack thing?
What was the capacitor? I

425
00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:03.010
mean, where was the power?
It had 17 miles of

426
00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:06.880
copper wire. Yeah. 400 pounds
of transformative steel. What did

427
00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:11.950
you wrap it? Around high
school football fields. It's 17

428
00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:17.260
miles of copper wire. That's
fantastic. Well, we're running at

429
00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:18.700
a time cause you're getting
ready to go on stage

430
00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:20.920
here at tech. Ready? Six.
I really appreciate you taking

431
00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:22.180
just a moment to sit
down with me here in

432
00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:24.370
the green room. Thank you
very much, doctor Michio. Kaku

433
00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:25.060
okay.
