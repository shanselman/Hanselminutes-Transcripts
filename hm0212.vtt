00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:53.660
Spolsky Welcome to another excruciating
episode of this deco flow

8
00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.730
podcast. This time, I guess
that's our opening. Even tell

9
00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.680
Jeff Atwood that the show
was going to happen. That

10
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.650
was the first attempt at
an improvement, but I'm still

11
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.750
here. Well, Jeff was on
the show last week. That

12
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.580
was he. He was, I
know that you really listened

13
00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.720
to my podcast religiously. So
you noticed, of course that

14
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.820
Jeff was, I'm just, I'm
just, I just have delay

15
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.500
with, with how long it
takes them to get onto

16
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.270
my iPhone, because I can
only plug it in at

17
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.250
work once a week or
so. So, so I'm still

18
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.950
listening to the lady that's
in charge of the win.

19
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.310
Oh my God. That is
incredibly well. That was like

20
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.320
a year and a half
ago. Yeah. And that was

21
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.930
an amazing episode. Let me
tell you she's pretty cool.

22
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.980
If I, if I hang
up the phone, what will

23
00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:42.350
happen with, with this podcast
right now, then if I

24
00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.330
hang up, if you hang
up the phone that I

25
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:45.800
won't have a backing track
and I won't be able

26
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.340
to record you and that's
how podcasting works, but you're

27
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.990
going to get, you're going
to get a recording sent

28
00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.520
to you. All right. Nevermind.
I'm going to, I'm just

29
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.050
going to try to, what
if I hold the phone

30
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.900
like this, or I'm going
to switch it to sweet

31
00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.780
speakerphone. That's what I'm gonna
do. So what, what Joel

32
00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.180
is talking about is that
Joel and I are recording

33
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.080
this very special episode of
Hansel minutes and we're doing

34
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.890
it a stack overflow and
the stack Oracle podcast, because

35
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.640
the problem is that Joe
Joel is on a Skype

36
00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.250
call and I really don't
like Skype. Scott refused to

37
00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.650
do Skype and wants me
to use the plain old

38
00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.160
telephone service that makes beautiful.
You just put the phone

39
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.830
down. Yeah. But you can
still hear me, right. I'm

40
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.750
hearing you through Skype though.
But see the phone is

41
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.240
on this, this line. I
need the phone for a

42
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.610
backing track. So you should
be, but you should be

43
00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.660
hearing me through the speakerphone
speakers. Okay. Yeah. That's probably

44
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.460
adequate. It's my sound guy.
That's gonna worry about it.

45
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.680
So, because you're going to,
I'm going to give you

46
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.830
a beautiful love, my voice,
but the issue is Joel,

47
00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.280
that I need a third
track with both of our

48
00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.950
voices so that I can
line them up. Yeah. You

49
00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.630
only have to line them
up once though, right? It's

50
00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.650
not, it's not true, Joel,
because they get out of

51
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.360
sync. They get out of
sync. They guys. Yeah. Well

52
00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.730
here's what we'll do. We'll
clap. Right. And then that

53
00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.130
clap will be on both
tracks. You'll line up. So

54
00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.950
let's talk about the differences
in sound quality between the

55
00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.940
second podcast and the Hansel
minutes podcast brought to you

56
00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.600
by NPR. Yeah. You're sounds
great. When you have those

57
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.080
little Tutti, Frutti microphone, things
that you have there, and

58
00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.420
you have people live, you're
sitting in the wind hotel

59
00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.510
lobby somewhere talking to some,
some person who does Twitter,

60
00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.180
but, but mine works great
when you have remote people

61
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.420
or it works as well
as, as anything compared to

62
00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.280
the quality of a, of
a pot's phone conversation. Which

63
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.130
just sounds like I am
well, yeah. An angry people

64
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.170
late at night. Yeah. That
is the issue. There is

65
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:48.060
a, but Skype. I tell
you it's it's it sounds

66
00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.860
like a great idea, but
you can tell when you're

67
00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.530
listening to a podcast that
was recorded on Skype and

68
00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.610
there's Compared to the actual
being there. Now, what this

69
00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.320
podcast will be by the
time people listen to, it

70
00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.540
will be a slightly unsynchronized
collection of two MP3 files

71
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.860
or whatever you want to
actual digital three. But what's

72
00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.540
the third one is doesn't
have any sound that we

73
00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.760
need. We need your voice
from your way file in

74
00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.440
my voice from my way.
All right, let's do this.

75
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.930
Explain to me audio engineer,
line it up. Let's do

76
00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.240
it this way. Explain to
me how your, you guys

77
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.730
record your podcast. Give me
the technical stuff. And then

78
00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.010
we'll break down the technical
stuff of our pockets. Okay.

79
00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.680
So here's how we record
our podcast. I have a,

80
00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.910
so I got this headset
and this is going into

81
00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.940
a mixer over here. And
then I've got one computer

82
00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.480
for every, this is interesting.
One computer for every participant.

83
00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.610
Usually it's just Jeff. But
if we have a guest,

84
00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.530
I'll have two computers and
I think I've done it

85
00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.530
once with three computers. And
then what I have to

86
00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.690
do is each of these
computers has a separate Skype

87
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.650
conversation with people. Now Skype
does have conference calling, but

88
00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.680
I don't use the conference
calling capability of Skype because

89
00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.290
it tries to have to
Plex or whatever that feature

90
00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.830
is to prevent feedback. So
what I have to do

91
00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.760
is have an individual conversation
with people on Skype, on

92
00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.700
each computer. And then each
computer has a sound card

93
00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.150
I'm using these external audio
pro things that are connected

94
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:14.760
by USB. And those each
feed their sound into a

95
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.010
big old mixer and the
mixer mixes it. And it

96
00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:22.230
creates multiple ox outs, which
are what the sound engineers

97
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.680
call a mix minus that
the word mix minus I

98
00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.860
think so the idea is
that if I'm having a

99
00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.460
call with Scott and Jeff,
then Jeff needs to hear

100
00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.070
my voice and Scott's voice,
but he can't hear his

101
00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.290
voice because that will confuse
him. So I have a

102
00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:40.020
mixer that has the capability
of taking everybody, but Jeff

103
00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.210
and feeding that back to
Jeff and taking everybody. But

104
00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.520
Scott feeding that back to
Scott and letting me hear

105
00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.760
everybody in my headsets. And
then that all goes into

106
00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.670
a digital recorder that records
everybody on an individual tracks.

107
00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:53.280
I've got a four track
digital recorder, which is a

108
00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.950
standalone Ederle device. I could,
I could turn around my

109
00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:59.960
camera and show it to
you, Scott. But the, the

110
00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.210
audience won't see it. And
it's a standalone, a digital

111
00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:07.490
recorder that records, you know,
each of the channels. And

112
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.950
so then I can go
back and in, in post

113
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:11.660
production, what I do is
on each channel, I do

114
00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.170
individual noise reduction because different
people have different noise profiles

115
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:18.050
depending on wherever they're sitting.
And you know, and I

116
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:21.230
removed snaps in his, his,
his, and pops and crackles

117
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:24.980
and bad words. And sometimes
what I do is I

118
00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:28.130
take a little snippet of
Jeff laughing. Usually it's something

119
00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:30.260
he's reading on the internet
and I move it after

120
00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.240
one of the jokes that
I told. So it sounds

121
00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:37.600
like he's laughing. I have
to. So I should probably

122
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:41.500
laugh just in case. Give
me some laughter. That was

123
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.900
great, Joel. No, that was
the bad Latin. That was

124
00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.150
terrible. I know it was
called, but I don't really

125
00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:48.310
want to talk about the
technology of the podcast. This

126
00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:50.320
being a podcast on podcasting.
What I want to do

127
00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:54.460
is talk about the contents.
Cause I think that we,

128
00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.140
we just got, got a
little bit bored with this

129
00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:59.020
deco flow podcast. We were
kind of repeating ourselves, the

130
00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:02.230
audience hasn't grown for about
a year, we sort of

131
00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.650
rapidly ascended to about 40,000
and then kind of got

132
00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:08.110
stuck there. And I'm hearing
a lot of that from,

133
00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.060
from, from how do you
measure this as a podcast?

134
00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:12.340
I have no idea. This
is one of the problems

135
00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:14.500
with it. Conversations is that
if I ask them, they'll

136
00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.960
tell me, but they have
to go dig into something.

137
00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.880
There's no Right. But what
I, what I'm saying is

138
00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.830
that it's been a big
problem for us to figure

139
00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:24.250
out how many people are
listening because a download doesn't

140
00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:26.890
mean a listen, Okay, download
this or not. But download,

141
00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:29.410
Cover that someone maybe listened
to halfway got sick of

142
00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:32.560
you and then stop listening
and download. Doesn't tell you

143
00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:35.320
whether they shared it with
their friends because podcasts can't

144
00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:38.410
phone home. They can't really.
Yeah. It's not so easy

145
00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:40.660
to share a podcast with
a friend. Really, If you,

146
00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:42.880
we have lots and lots
of people overseas and I

147
00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:46.090
mean lots who take download
the podcast and then they

148
00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:47.770
copy it up to a
share. And then the company

149
00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:52.030
listens to it. You're kidding.
Right. Especially in Africa, The

150
00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:54.220
worst problem with downloads, which
is that I download all

151
00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:56.050
your podcasts got, but I
only listen to the ones

152
00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:58.330
with, you know, the, that
I can understand like the

153
00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:01.190
Twitter lady from the hotel,
right? And then there are

154
00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.950
all these ones where it's
like, we are the code

155
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:08.050
asp.net, MVC, GQ, our P
L G dot code behind

156
00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:12.460
in version of control, container
mega complex for SharePoint operating

157
00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:16.750
systems for windows seven, mobile
for windows, Trademark. And then

158
00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:18.880
you just hang up at
that point. You just, No,

159
00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:20.620
I never listened to that,
but I did. I do

160
00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:22.780
download it cause that's what
iTunes does. It's just like,

161
00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:26.530
Hey, feed me, just keeps
downloaded. I'm starting to tell

162
00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:31.840
maybe what your problem was.
It's your podcast. I may,

163
00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.790
I may, I may be,
you know, just a hunch,

164
00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:42.910
Maybe it's you, Joel, I,
before we go any further,

165
00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:44.470
I have to warn you
that just before I came

166
00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:47.410
in here, I had a
great grain of rice that

167
00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:50.500
had a lot of like
habanero pepper sauce on it.

168
00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:55.290
And it is lodged in
my sinus, snorted it, of

169
00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:58.200
eating it. I love that.
What you just said kind

170
00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:01.020
of proved the point that
I just made. It's really

171
00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:07.190
This Episode of Hansel minutes,
John gets stuck in his

172
00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:10.340
sinus cavity. Exactly. It really,
at some point there may

173
00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:13.460
be kind of explosive like
sneezing through five years or

174
00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:18.590
something. Oh my goodness. Yeah.
Okay. Got it. So measuring,

175
00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:22.340
measuring has been a challenge.
We, there are many ways

176
00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:24.440
to measure a podcast. There's
what they call first bite,

177
00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:27.140
which means they started a
download lashed bite, which means

178
00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:29.720
they ended the download. And
then you can kind of

179
00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:31.520
treat it like a, like
a feed, like on feed

180
00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:35.120
burner, where you can say,
we think that there's a

181
00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:38.900
certain amount of reach beyond
the downloads themselves. I think

182
00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:42.920
we estimate 10% reach, which
means that somebody shared the

183
00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:46.130
podcast with somebody, whether they
put it on a shelf

184
00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:48.680
somewhere or they re blogged
it, we have a number

185
00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:51.560
of people who take our
podcast and you can find

186
00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:54.800
it elsewhere on the net.
Right. And it's hard to,

187
00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:58.250
it's hard to measure these
things well, but the One

188
00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:00.110
thing that I think most
people would say, you probably

189
00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:02.540
can measure, even if you
don't know how many people

190
00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:04.280
are listening to the beginning
of the end, et cetera,

191
00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:10.430
is relative. Yes. You can
absolutely measure whether or not

192
00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:12.860
a show was a good.
And we also measure how

193
00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:15.680
many downloads we get over
the, what we call the

194
00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:19.850
catalog. So when we talk
to advertisers, we usually tell

195
00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:22.340
them that this week, you
know, we get X downloads

196
00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:25.040
over the catalog, which means
that your ad will kind

197
00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:28.100
of live forever. We have
a little 32nd ad in

198
00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:32.990
the middle. And that, that
ad is, is, is that

199
00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:34.570
a part of the podcast
or does that, can that

200
00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:37.610
change? What will happen is
then I will use my,

201
00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:39.650
basically we'll find a pause
in the middle of our

202
00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:42.530
conversation and then I will
come out kind of like

203
00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:44.300
IRA glass and all of
a sudden, yeah, No, I

204
00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:46.010
know about that from a
different, another place in time,

205
00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:48.230
but could it be an
ad that was placed even

206
00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:50.930
after that podcast was recorded?
Like years later I've done

207
00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:52.550
that, but we could, we
could go back into the

208
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:55.610
catalog and then put in
different ads. But no one's

209
00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:57.200
asked for that and tell
it, tell her it has

210
00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.570
been our, our guy for
a year and a half.

211
00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:04.040
Yeah. They don't seem to
care. Hey man, if somebody

212
00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:06.320
had to pay for the
bandwidth, it is expensive to

213
00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:10.760
run a podcast. Yeah. Yeah.
Lawrence, the editor who is,

214
00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:12.680
who answered the phone for
you Lawrence and he does

215
00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:15.540
editing and he's in the
studio right now. We are,

216
00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:18.620
our recording process is different
than your recording. You look

217
00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:20.780
like you're in a house.
So I'm in my, I'm

218
00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:22.760
in my house in Portland,
Oregon. It's not the studio.

219
00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:24.860
This is not the studio,
but I have my little

220
00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:27.770
kind of, he's an actual
studio, right? He's in new

221
00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:32.390
castle, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Connecticut. And
does he have some feed

222
00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:35.360
of your how's he getting?
You're just going to send

223
00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:38.840
them the audio. I have
an M audio. Microtrack 24

224
00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:44.690
96 little wave recorder here.
I've got a studio mic

225
00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:47.960
stand deal with a spit
filter and a pop filter.

226
00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:54.670
I've got a couple of
fancy cardioid audio Technica ensure

227
00:11:54.670 --> 00:12:00.310
microphones. And I record 44
kilohertz wave locally. I never

228
00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:02.050
use MP3s because I don't
want to make copies of

229
00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:05.770
copies. And then I call
into a conference. I call

230
00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:08.170
into a special line for
me, like a back line.

231
00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:11.770
And then you called into
a conference line and then

232
00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:14.710
each person calling into that
conference line is an individual

233
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:16.240
track. So you were talking
about how you deal with

234
00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.970
different tracks. Yeah. We can
have other people call into

235
00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:22.060
these, this, this, this, this,
this conference line. And then

236
00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:25.570
each of those goes into
a telos at, in Connecticut.

237
00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:27.610
And then each of those
goes down to a track.

238
00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:29.680
And then Lawrence does everything
that you described. He does

239
00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.970
all the sound Cleaning up
and making up and whatnot.

240
00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:36.600
Yeah. For example, I realized
that my he's going to

241
00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:38.640
be mad at me, but
I'll yeah. Since this is

242
00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:40.920
a show about podcasting, I
had my, I had my

243
00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:44.070
level set to medium for
the beginning part of the

244
00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:46.500
show. And then I realized
I had to switch it

245
00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:48.060
back to high. So then
somewhere in the middle of

246
00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:50.610
the show, my voice would
go like this and Lawrence

247
00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:52.380
will probably have to fix
that. And then he'll call

248
00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:53.850
me later and tell me
not to do that again.

249
00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.240
Well, at least somebody listens
to your show before we

250
00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:00.510
go live. So this is
an interesting question though. I

251
00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:03.810
mean, like, I always think
about NPR as my, my

252
00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:05.820
goal. Like if the show
can sound like, you know,

253
00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:08.370
this American life or something
like that, then that's success.

254
00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.680
But you guys just record
a phone call and throw

255
00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:15.630
it up on the web.
Yeah. Now, well, there's two

256
00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:18.090
things to talk about. One
is audio quality, which we

257
00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:22.380
are reasonably assessed about, but
I think Skype quality, what

258
00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:24.900
we're doing is also what
Leo LaPorte does. That's pretty

259
00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:27.990
much, it's the gold standard.
It's not having to wall

260
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.020
files or everybody being there
in a room. But if

261
00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:35.610
you're going to do a
remote yes. Team thing, it's,

262
00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:37.770
it's, it's fine. I mean,
people, you can listen to

263
00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:40.590
it on, on a headset.
It sounds definitely better than

264
00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:43.250
phone. Well, I had to
do some tests in that.

265
00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.990
Cause the thing is Carl Franklin,
who is my sponsor. He's

266
00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:50.520
the guy who owns the
studio. Yep. I hate Skype.

267
00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:53.910
Well maybe he hasn't listened
to it lately. Skype, maybe

268
00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:55.650
it's come a long way.
Right? I mean, what is

269
00:13:55.650 --> 00:13:58.170
the audio quality over Skype
over the phone? It's eight

270
00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:01.860
kilohertz. Yeah. I think it's
16 bit eight kilohertz. It's

271
00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:05.730
like you said, it's it's
it's mano am. Yeah. Skype

272
00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:07.920
will go is as high
as it needs to. And

273
00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:10.980
depending on how much bandwidth
is available. So if you

274
00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:12.750
listen to my podcast with
Jeff, I know people say

275
00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:15.120
that it sounds like Skype,
but honestly I cannot hear

276
00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:17.070
the difference between me and
him in terms of audio

277
00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:19.800
quality. Sometimes he's better than
I am because he's got

278
00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:22.320
a slightly superior microphone. And
the way in which his

279
00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.570
microphone is superior is that
this is, this is a

280
00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:28.200
mic that's designed, I think
for sportscasters. And so it's

281
00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:31.170
trying to reduce ambient noise.
And that means if I

282
00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:34.350
turn my face a little
bit, it'll, it'll cut out

283
00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:38.760
really, really quickly. Like it
just did Really close to

284
00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:40.800
your face though that Mike,
I mean, I can hear.

285
00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:43.530
Yeah. You know, I feel
like I'm inside your mouth

286
00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:45.900
right now. Right. And that's
what Jeff sounds like to

287
00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:48.030
me. And when we record
that, that's what it ends

288
00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:50.580
up sounding like. And you
know, we both got high

289
00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:55.210
bandwidth Skype and we never
use wifi and we, and

290
00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:56.990
when we do, it's a
mistake and it's a disaster

291
00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:00.770
and we also, you know,
so that we have direct

292
00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:03.400
connections pots and we cheat.
Yeah. You said we never

293
00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:08.680
use wifi. Yeah. We never
used wifi. Oh, you're saying

294
00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:11.800
that you always connect. We
always connect over the wire

295
00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:15.400
with Skype because wifi will
drop out, you know, sometimes

296
00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:17.470
even, Well, let's see. And
then this, I think this

297
00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:20.260
is more the issue rather
than the issue about whether

298
00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.840
you use Skype or not.
The issue is do you

299
00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:25.510
have a decent mic and
you have a reliable connection.

300
00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:28.990
I was talking to John
skeet on one of the

301
00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:31.960
shows a while back and
I was trying to give

302
00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:33.220
him the list of all
the things I want him

303
00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:35.140
to do. And the thing
is that for a guest,

304
00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:38.530
sometimes it's just easier to
say, just pick up the

305
00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:40.870
phone and call this number.
And I will admit that

306
00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:43.300
that's, if he had an
awesome mic and I had

307
00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:45.250
him buy one or I
mailed him one or DHL

308
00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:47.140
done one and we just,
I just went to his

309
00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:49.290
office when we needed John
skeet as a guest. But,

310
00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:54.070
but in general we will,
we will, it's a nice

311
00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:56.020
trip. Now. We were there
for, we were there for

312
00:15:56.020 --> 00:16:01.570
dev days. Anyway, we will,
we'll just order a, what

313
00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:05.230
we know is a good
USB headset for somebody it's

314
00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:06.730
like 45 bucks. And we'll
just order it for the

315
00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:08.980
moment on Amazon and have
it delivered to them. And

316
00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:12.040
then they'll plug in the
USB and we'll, we'll spend

317
00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:13.990
a little bit of time
walking them through opening supports,

318
00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:16.630
but sometimes it gets pretty
bad. Like what'll happen. We've

319
00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:18.820
had some pretty bad shows
where you talk to people

320
00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:20.200
and they're like, yeah, yeah,
I got the headset. The

321
00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:22.270
Skype is going to be
awesome. It works really well.

322
00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:24.970
And then they'll just open
like a Mac laptop on

323
00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:28.770
wifi from a library somewhere.
Awesome. I can't talk to

324
00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:32.890
that because it sounds it'll
sound awful because you know,

325
00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:34.720
when you just open a
laptop, you've got the microphone

326
00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:37.720
in the speaker and there's
some kind of feedback. It's

327
00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:39.070
funny that you say that
because there's been a number

328
00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:41.350
of times when I've had
people on the show. And

329
00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:43.090
I had to think about
like, what kind of guests

330
00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:45.310
is this? Like, is this
an important guest? Is this

331
00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:47.860
like, just like a famous
physicist. I'm not going to

332
00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:50.410
piss him off by giving
him to do, because some

333
00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:52.210
of these guys, you just
want him to call in,

334
00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:54.820
do the show and then
they want to leave the

335
00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:57.010
green room and like, you
know, go get their gift

336
00:16:57.010 --> 00:17:00.580
basket. But if you give
them a task yeah. Then,

337
00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:03.700
but depending on their personalities,
they're not interested in accomplishing

338
00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:07.240
your team. I'm not, Oh,
they'll do. Yeah. Our programmers,

339
00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:09.700
like the people that people
are favorite everybody's favorite show

340
00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:13.330
was that we did was
Steve Yaggie. Who's an absolutely

341
00:17:13.330 --> 00:17:15.490
hilarious programmer. We used to
work for Amazon now works

342
00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:20.680
for Google and you know,
really, really smart, really, really

343
00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:25.330
well spoken, writes beautiful blog
posts. And, and that was

344
00:17:25.330 --> 00:17:27.220
by far our favorite show.
And he's, you know, somebody

345
00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:29.800
like that, he's a programmer.
He's happy to plug in

346
00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:33.460
whatever USB microphone you send
them. Yeah. I just had

347
00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:35.110
a couple of times where
I didn't like, you know,

348
00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:37.000
but like, I guess the
more famous the guest is,

349
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000
the more what's the word
or more star struck I

350
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.130
get. And I don't want
to like make, I don't

351
00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:45.730
want my most famous guests.
We, when we, when we

352
00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:48.190
had bill Gates on, I
was like, bill, you're just

353
00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:50.220
not working for me. You
need to get off You

354
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:54.000
right now, go to staples
and get a Plantronics. And,

355
00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:58.130
and, and he did it
Steve jobs. Wouldn't though Trying

356
00:17:58.130 --> 00:18:01.640
to think who my most
famous guests I've done 210

357
00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:07.280
shows. Charles pencils was pretty
huge how he'll put on

358
00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:10.820
him. But he's awesome though.
Dan, Dan, Brooklyn, Dan Bricklin

359
00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:14.150
and vendor, the spreadsheet, Dan
Bricklin would like nothing more.

360
00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:15.950
I mean, we could, Yeah,
I know. I'm looking for

361
00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:19.400
somebody who's famous who didn't
And talking about what the

362
00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:22.970
best headset is. Yeah. Dan
Bricklin Dan Appleman is around

363
00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:26.720
programmers. I did have, I
did have Michio Kaku on

364
00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:30.730
the show. Like I invented
string theory and I did

365
00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:32.480
definitely did not want to
make him angry. Cause at

366
00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:36.170
any point he could have
just like left and just

367
00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:39.320
said, And then the universe
would wink out. Exactly. That's

368
00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:42.290
exactly what would have happened.
Oh, I had this guy

369
00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:43.940
is not famous, but he's
awesome. I had the guy

370
00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:49.760
that invented the Wildcat VBS.
Oh yeah. And I liked

371
00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:53.180
that episode. Mary Jo Foley,
Mary Jo Foley was on

372
00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:56.180
she's the lady who like
ma like on Microsoft, all

373
00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:58.460
about Microsoft. It was really
kind of kind of sobering

374
00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:01.070
because it made the difference
between a technologist and a

375
00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:04.280
journalist became clear. Cause we
were talking about like windows

376
00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:07.940
seven and she was running
windows XP. So she covered

377
00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:10.110
it from a journalistic perspective,
but she didn't actually have

378
00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:13.490
Have it. So that, that,
that is one thing I

379
00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:15.170
noticed about Mary Jo over
the years is she knows

380
00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:20.870
more about Microsoft than anybody,
but without, but she still

381
00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:24.350
doesn't really have that. The
understanding of the technology. Like

382
00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:27.980
she can tell you what
other people have said about.

383
00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:30.830
Yeah. I think that's true.
That's journalism though. Right? Isn't

384
00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:33.320
it? I think so. You
know, there's a different class

385
00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:37.190
of journalists, which are like
the <inaudible> and the, the

386
00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:41.990
Leo who shall remain nameless,
who actually do get the

387
00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:44.780
technology. I think more than
she does. Well, they don't

388
00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:47.090
get the technology then. Oh,
here's one Tim Bray. Oh,

389
00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:50.750
Leo LaPorte. Sure. He does
Johnny Varek definitely is a

390
00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:55.190
programmer. No, really? Yeah. Why
is Lila port's podcast doing

391
00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:57.590
so much better than that?
Ah, no. That's an interesting

392
00:19:57.590 --> 00:20:00.020
question. The podcasts that I
think are doing really well

393
00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:03.650
these days that are really
like smash hits are all

394
00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:09.440
they're all journalists, journalists, and
professional broadcasters. The old report

395
00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:11.840
from tech TV days that
he has been on the

396
00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:16.310
radio since he was probably
on WIBC at Yale. So

397
00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:19.310
he's been on, he's been
a radio host for ages.

398
00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:22.490
John of Oreck obviously has
been a journalist for years.

399
00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:26.330
Adam Curry was a VJ and
is just a fantastic broadcaster.

400
00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:29.930
Really? Even though he's spouting
crazy conspiracy theories, Hang on

401
00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:31.940
a second here. Let me
stop you. Yeah. People always

402
00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:36.740
say, blah, blah, blah Jones
is an amazing radio host

403
00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:39.560
and it doesn't, you know,
it doesn't really have any

404
00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:41.840
idea what he's talking about.
Spouts talking completely out of

405
00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:45.680
his ass, but fantastic journalist
and a great broadcaster. Correct.

406
00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:47.770
What does that mean? Does
that mean I'm a lousy

407
00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:51.990
broadcaster and a great technologist.
Yeah. The both of us,

408
00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:56.220
I cannot listen to these
guys. God, God bless it.

409
00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:59.010
I just can't listen to
them. Do you listen to

410
00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:00.270
a lot of podcasts? I
mean, you work from home

411
00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:02.400
so you don't have a
car. I understand that. I

412
00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:05.640
enjoy doing this and I
want to take this to

413
00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:11.250
the next level. But you
know, Leo, LaPorte's got 185,000

414
00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:13.890
followers on Twitter and God
knows, and he's always in

415
00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:17.340
the top eight of the
top 10 iTunes things are

416
00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:20.910
his and I'm on page
seven. I realize I'm talking

417
00:21:20.910 --> 00:21:24.150
about programming, but if I
just like made up facts

418
00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:26.760
about edit this part of
your registry and windows, then

419
00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:30.450
that would somehow make the
show more popular. Hey, it's

420
00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:34.110
alternate universe, Scott Hanselman going
to thank our sponsors for

421
00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:36.330
making this free show possible.
We've been doing Hansel minutes

422
00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:38.340
for almost four years now
and we really couldn't do

423
00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:40.110
it without tolerance. So I
want to tell you about

424
00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:42.120
some of the stuff they're
working on. If you've already

425
00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:45.300
started developing with Silverlight, then
you probably need a solid

426
00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:48.000
testing tool to do your
serval at UIs. Unfortunately though,

427
00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:50.370
a lot of the tools
available today only help you

428
00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:52.590
with unit testing. There's not
really a good way to

429
00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:55.440
simulate the actual behavior of
those end users, unless you

430
00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:57.360
spend days and weeks doing
a lot of manual testing.

431
00:21:58.020 --> 00:21:59.890
But the guys at Tellerik,
you've got a new point

432
00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:02.760
and click UI testing tool
for server line called web

433
00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:05.670
UI test studio. The beauty
is that you can quickly

434
00:22:05.670 --> 00:22:09.630
record your tests with a
cross-browser recorder. You can enrich

435
00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:12.540
them with code. If you've
got really complex scenarios. And

436
00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:14.580
on top of that, it
supports all the standard controls

437
00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:17.850
as well as the Tellerik
enhanced controls. You can verify

438
00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:21.390
not only server life, but
even complex Ajax applications, best

439
00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:24.570
part web UI test studio
lives in visual studio. So

440
00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:27.600
you don't have to leave
your favorite development environment. You

441
00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:32.610
check it out at telerik.com/web
hyphen testing, hyphen tools, and

442
00:22:32.610 --> 00:22:34.590
be sure to thank Tellerik
for supporting the show on

443
00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:39.660
their Facebook fan page at
facebook.com/tellerik. Well, the other one

444
00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:41.430
who always on the top
of the iTunes list or

445
00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:44.960
newly is Adam Corolla. That's
different. He's a famous as

446
00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:48.270
a nationally famous comedian and
movie actor and TV actor.

447
00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:52.350
And he's almost done. It's
been, I mean, he's a

448
00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:54.120
comedian and a movie actor
and TV actor and stuff

449
00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:57.240
like that. And then nationally
famous. True. But he brought

450
00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:59.760
his audience from his radio
show from a syndicated radio

451
00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:01.320
show. So he was like
a, like a, maybe like

452
00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:04.860
a slightly smaller than Howard
stern kind of person. And

453
00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:07.830
what I, what I think
is going on, it's not

454
00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:09.510
that he brought an audience
of a million people. It's

455
00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:12.210
not like if Oprah suddenly
started podcasting, she would have

456
00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:16.650
2 million people in the case
of Adam Lila, port, Adam Curry,

457
00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:20.370
the other Adam, I think
that these people are just

458
00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:23.670
pros that are trained and
in radio Broadcasting. Okay. So

459
00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:27.360
what's what does that mean?
That's just, that's what I'm

460
00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:30.300
looking at is, has site
on twitch.tv. He's got 21

461
00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:33.750
shows. He's got the production
value down solid. He's probably

462
00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:36.750
got a team of editors.
He's got that whole cartoon

463
00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:40.170
of the person who's on
the show thing. Like nicely

464
00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:43.470
done everyone. Everyone has their
own little cartoon. I don't

465
00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:47.750
know if any of these
people are. Yeah. The, I,

466
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:50.870
I, from listening to his,
to his shows to anecdotal

467
00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:53.990
shows, it's a little bit
hard to say. One is,

468
00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:57.170
you know, Leo is a
good interviewer because he's on

469
00:23:57.170 --> 00:24:00.510
every show, right? That's the
thing it's like, no, no,

470
00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:02.110
I'm not on the network
shows no. Well, I'm going

471
00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:04.660
on. All these shows like
munch cast, it's a food

472
00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:07.840
show, a lot of them
and it's Kimmy Blackstone and

473
00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:11.980
Leo deported. He doesn't drive
the shows except for twit

474
00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:14.950
and maybe Mac break and
a couple of big ones.

475
00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:18.190
But the, the everything after
the, once you get past

476
00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:20.770
the top two or three,
he's on there, but there's

477
00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:24.310
somebody else who's responsible for
getting the guests for leading

478
00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:27.520
the conversation and so forth.
The other thing that's these

479
00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:31.000
shows are like 90 minutes
long. Yeah. Some of them

480
00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.570
are really long. They're two
hours. Yeah. I'm looking at

481
00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:37.000
this almost all of these
shows are at least an

482
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.820
hour and they're every single
week. We always this whole

483
00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:41.950
job. No, I get that.
Yeah. I think he sits

484
00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:44.080
there in the studio for
four, six hours a day.

485
00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:47.320
Just talk at least just
talking. Yeah. And that's not

486
00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:49.150
that odd. I mean, I'm
sure Howard stern does that

487
00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:53.200
much talking as well. And
in any popular, you know,

488
00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:59.860
radio, radio personality, Terry, Terry Gross.
And we'll do that Three

489
00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:04.080
hour session to get, to
get fresh air. So you

490
00:25:04.090 --> 00:25:06.670
get 20 minutes in the
editor. Yeah. Well, no fresh

491
00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:08.920
air is an hour, but
she doesn't do the whole

492
00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:11.470
hour. Usually there's a half
hour. I'm trying to think

493
00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:13.450
of that for the fresh
air format. Usually there's like

494
00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:16.930
half hour to 40 minutes
of her interviewing. Okay. And

495
00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:19.810
then sometimes if somebody else
comes on and like reviews

496
00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:22.330
a jazz album or something
like that. So, but that,

497
00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:24.850
that comes out of like
a three hour interview that

498
00:25:24.850 --> 00:25:27.610
she then hands over to
editors and they were solid

499
00:25:27.610 --> 00:25:30.550
for a day to condense
it into something good. And

500
00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:33.850
when you're here an interview
on NPR, like a real

501
00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:37.060
NPR interview, like all things
considered on Saturday morning with,

502
00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:40.960
you know, one of those
Soviet Jolie type people, you

503
00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:43.390
know, you know, you know,
That's Soviet Petrolia is in

504
00:25:43.390 --> 00:25:44.980
Rome. That's all I know.
Yeah. She's the one in

505
00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:47.740
Rome who said, who are
some of the announcers? They're

506
00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:52.240
always, probably they're all scaping
me right now. All things

507
00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:56.260
considered are weekend edition. Our
friends, everyone on all these

508
00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:59.170
are American TV shows, by
the way, for folks that

509
00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:03.940
are Radio radio, radio shows
real national public radio, ATC

510
00:26:04.030 --> 00:26:06.520
NPR. I don't know. Yeah.
But they're all journalists. It's

511
00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:07.840
just different. Maybe that's the
thing. Maybe I need to

512
00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:10.200
go to school there Journalists.
And what they do is

513
00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:13.630
again, they do it Robert
<inaudible> Robert Siegel. Okay. So

514
00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:16.330
Robert Siegel, you'll hear a
one minute thing where it

515
00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:19.600
sounds like he's interviewing somebody
for a minute and it's

516
00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:21.790
the most amazing minute you
ever heard. And that came

517
00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:24.610
out of an hour and
a half interview that got

518
00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:27.010
edited to get the good
parts I'm saying this because

519
00:26:27.010 --> 00:26:28.270
you believe it or because
you know it to be

520
00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:29.830
true. No, because I know
it to be true. That's

521
00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:31.600
how, that's what this has
done. Okay. That is how

522
00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:34.360
this has done Bobi and
that's. And that's why those

523
00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:37.690
things are, you know, they,
they have that shiny Pearl

524
00:26:37.690 --> 00:26:43.020
like glow Of a real
piece of journalism that we're

525
00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:45.630
going have, but that's very
different than what Leo LaPorte

526
00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:48.600
and Adam Corolla, who are
from the radio world and

527
00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:50.610
the radio world. You've got
three hours of air to

528
00:26:50.610 --> 00:26:52.680
fill and that's your job
or six hours of air

529
00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:54.360
to fill. And you might
have a guest in the

530
00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:56.910
studio and some people calling
in and you just need

531
00:26:56.910 --> 00:26:59.420
to Blab and keep the
conversation going. That's the thing

532
00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:02.270
I'm so uncomfortable that format.
Remember that the whole point

533
00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:04.880
of Hanselman it's was minutes.
It's not the Hansel hour.

534
00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:07.550
It's it's supposed to let
people have something to do

535
00:27:07.550 --> 00:27:10.100
while they commute. And I'm
looking here. Well, that's what

536
00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:14.570
your fill in time. Well
I'm okay. The goal was

537
00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:16.940
not to waste anyone's time
is to give you content

538
00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:20.930
and information, not this show,
but other shows looking at

539
00:27:20.930 --> 00:27:23.510
this, this Twitch show, it
goes for an hour and

540
00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:26.570
44 minutes this week. And
the show is called eat

541
00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:29.930
a hot bowl of Nintendo
wheeze, Which means that, that

542
00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:31.670
was a joke that somebody
I know, But it's like

543
00:27:31.670 --> 00:27:33.920
four guys and they just
talk about stuff for the

544
00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:36.050
day and you get, no,
I just can't. I just

545
00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:38.870
can't listen to the show,
The format of this week

546
00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:40.430
in tech, which is really
interesting because it is probably

547
00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:43.070
the number one tech podcast
by, by leaps and bounds.

548
00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:47.030
Yeah. Is it's, it's always,
it's almost always journalists. He

549
00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:50.210
tries not to have guests
on that are actually people

550
00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:53.300
doing things. And I think
there's some reason for that,

551
00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:54.800
which I have to figure
out, but it's almost always

552
00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:57.500
tech journalists of some sort,
a lot of them, a

553
00:27:57.500 --> 00:28:02.090
lot of the recurring characters
are like the tech journalist

554
00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:05.330
for the Houston Chronicle or
the Chicago sun times. You'll

555
00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:08.390
have obviously John <inaudible>, who's
from CBS market watch, I

556
00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:10.610
think right now and PC
world and a couple of

557
00:28:10.610 --> 00:28:13.850
other and, and they're all
tech journalists and, and they

558
00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:16.130
each bring in, they have
some way of contributing kind

559
00:28:16.130 --> 00:28:17.900
of a list of what
they think the big stories

560
00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:19.970
are that week. And then
they just chat about them.

561
00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:23.210
But nobody prepares anything really.
So they're not particularly prepared

562
00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:26.030
to say anything insightful or
in depth about these things

563
00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:28.850
that they're talking about. Yeah.
It's just opinion. You know,

564
00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:31.370
what do you think about,
you know, Apple buying Google

565
00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:33.650
today? Definitely. I think I'm
looking at one of the

566
00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:35.360
things that they do that
I like is this YouTube

567
00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:38.510
thing. They'll take their show
and they'll report it and

568
00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:40.280
they'll put it on YouTube.
So it's actually available in

569
00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:43.340
multiple. Okay. It goes out
in like every possible format.

570
00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:46.010
And that's a part of
his method is that first

571
00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:47.750
of all, you can watch
the live stream and then

572
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:49.700
there's a chat while you're
watching that. It's pretty cool.

573
00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:52.340
That's pretty cool. You can
get it. The chatroom is

574
00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:55.310
very nice because this is
something we, we never had

575
00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:57.260
and you don't have either.
But if you, if you

576
00:28:57.260 --> 00:28:59.540
do it live and you
have a chat room and

577
00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:01.760
later you can edit it
into a real show. If

578
00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:03.920
there's something you don't know,
you don't have to stop

579
00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:05.600
and Google it or anything
like that, you don't have

580
00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:06.950
to interrupt the show. If
you're like, what was the

581
00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:09.620
name of that person on
all things considered? You say

582
00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:12.320
that and somebody in the
chat room types it and

583
00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:13.970
it's just there and you
know, That's cool. And then

584
00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:16.010
you're actually watching it while
it's being recorded. Like it's

585
00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:21.020
streams as well. Yep. Yep.
That's pretty cool. I wonder

586
00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:23.780
who, like, I think they
must be doing live editing,

587
00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:26.210
like director style editing, like
a, like a game show

588
00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:29.600
where it's like, go to
camera three for the video.

589
00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:33.320
Yeah. Leo port has a
TriCaster, which is a, basically

590
00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:35.030
a TV studio in a
box. It's a, in a

591
00:29:35.030 --> 00:29:37.100
knapsack. I think they call
it it's the size of

592
00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:40.700
a small mixer. So, you
know, maybe it's about 16

593
00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:43.540
inches by inches by four
inches. And it sits on

594
00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:46.720
his desk and it basically
lets you switch from camera

595
00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:48.700
to camera. It lets you
fade from camera to camera.

596
00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:52.390
It lets it lets him
bring in video from a

597
00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:55.180
PC or from a laptop
or from a guest's laptops.

598
00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:58.600
Cool. Let's put, he's got
it. It does all the

599
00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:01.660
bottom thirds, right? Like the
captions. So he's pushing buttons

600
00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:04.120
to get the names. And
what's actually shocking is that

601
00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:06.310
Leo is doing that live
while he's doing the show.

602
00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:09.010
No, he's actually pushing the
buttons himself. He doesn't have

603
00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:11.280
a for advice. It doesn't
have a person. So if,

604
00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:13.230
if, if, if, if a,
if you switched to a

605
00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:15.780
guest, a lot of times
it's wrong. Cause he'll lose

606
00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:18.120
interest in. It'll be putting
John Vorax name on a

607
00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:21.300
picture of, you know, somebody
else because he's not keeping

608
00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:25.530
up with it. Now they
have Jason Calacanis has the

609
00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:27.690
same setup, but he's got
a guy doing the TriCaster

610
00:30:27.690 --> 00:30:29.970
so he can just sort
of sit there and, and

611
00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:33.630
look, that's pretty cool. Interesting.
Maybe I need to go

612
00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:34.800
on here. Maybe I need
to be on his show.

613
00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:38.040
Maybe I should join his
network of, of talking guys.

614
00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:40.710
I don't know if you're
not really quite a journalist.

615
00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:42.690
He really does like people
that are, I mean the

616
00:30:42.690 --> 00:30:45.300
John, John Gruber would be
the furthest to field. He

617
00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:49.380
would get from somebody that's
actually in some way doing

618
00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:51.570
journalism and that's cause he
thinks of himself as, as

619
00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:54.480
being a news outlet like
tech TV, or like a

620
00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:57.240
journalistic endeavor a little bit.
He doesn't actually want it

621
00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:59.550
to be the people on
the insides like us actually

622
00:30:59.550 --> 00:31:03.030
building stuff or working on
stuff. Yeah. I got to

623
00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:04.590
go to journalism school. I
don't know what a journalist

624
00:31:04.650 --> 00:31:06.990
does these days. I think
of journalists. I think of

625
00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:10.650
like that guy on ABC
news, Ryan Ross, right? That's a

626
00:31:10.650 --> 00:31:12.920
journalist. That's the guy where
it's like and now coming

627
00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:15.090
with like literally my wife
and I are like watching

628
00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:18.540
the news. Brian Ross is our
big investigative journalist here in

629
00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:20.580
the U S and he'll
go and he'll say coming

630
00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:24.450
up next, Brian Ross. No. Oh,
I feel bad for the

631
00:31:24.450 --> 00:31:27.960
poor schmuck that they've sucked.
Brian ups they've sent Brian Ross.

632
00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:30.750
Africa is a pit bull.
Whatever, if he knocks on

633
00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:35.270
your door, it's over, that's
a journalist Camped out on

634
00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:40.650
here. Well, yeah, I dunno
if they would go that

635
00:31:40.650 --> 00:31:45.490
far, but these are definitely
Watchers, not doers. And I

636
00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:48.270
sometimes that's good and sometimes
it's bad and it's got

637
00:31:48.270 --> 00:31:50.700
its pros and cons, but
there is something, there are

638
00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:53.370
skills that I can see
how it would take a

639
00:31:53.370 --> 00:31:55.890
decade of radio broadcasting to
learn them. Because in the

640
00:31:55.890 --> 00:32:00.510
old days you didn't get
to be at the anchorman

641
00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:04.200
on CBS evening news without
having spent, you know, the

642
00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:08.070
first 10 years of your
life doing a crappy radio

643
00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:11.640
show where you played 45
singles and then announced them.

644
00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:14.610
And then the next five
years, maybe moving up to

645
00:32:14.610 --> 00:32:17.730
being the sports news guy
with one minute of sports

646
00:32:17.730 --> 00:32:19.080
news at the end of
the news on the top

647
00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:22.350
of every hour and a
big station in Albuquerque, you

648
00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:27.840
know, Koob 50,000 Watts reaches
500,000 people. That's a big

649
00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:29.820
market and then you might
move to the Chicago market.

650
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.950
And then suddenly you're kind
of the news reporter there.

651
00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:35.160
And after about 20 or
20 or 25 years, you

652
00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:37.890
had enough radio experience that
people just want to listen

653
00:32:37.890 --> 00:32:40.610
to. You talk somehow you,
you know, I mean it's

654
00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:43.880
like Howard stern, right? It
could anybody just make a

655
00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:49.310
show and interview strippers and
you know, say outrageous question

656
00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:51.950
and, and just have a
woman on the show whose

657
00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:55.160
job is to laugh. Could,
could anybody do that? And

658
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:59.090
the formula would work or
is there also something about,

659
00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:01.820
he's learned how to speak
to a microphone by doing

660
00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:04.340
it for six hours a
day for 10 years that

661
00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:05.870
has made him in some
way, an expert that makes

662
00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:09.460
people want to listen to
them. Interesting. So you're bored

663
00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:11.260
with your show though. So
all of that, this is

664
00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:15.370
very interesting because bringing it
back full circle, Leo talks

665
00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:18.280
to the microphone successfully for
four to six hours every

666
00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:21.730
day. And you're tired of
podcasts For decades. Yeah. And

667
00:33:21.970 --> 00:33:23.560
because first of all, I'm
not going to have the

668
00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:26.200
devil. It's not my number
one thing by far. So

669
00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:28.300
I'm not going to have
the devotion and the dedication

670
00:33:29.050 --> 00:33:31.960
to sit around and do
to, to do this to

671
00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:35.230
the point where I can
actually be even Adam Curry, who

672
00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:37.420
Adam Curry is funny. Right. Cause
he, his show, if you

673
00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:40.360
ever listened to it, it's
all about the stupidest conspiracy

674
00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:42.490
theories in the world and
you listen to it. And

675
00:33:42.490 --> 00:33:44.410
you're just like, I cannot
believe that Adam Cray got

676
00:33:44.410 --> 00:33:47.080
this far in life and
he believes this nonsense about,

677
00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:50.170
you know, th th th
nine 11 was created by

678
00:33:50.170 --> 00:33:54.760
the U S government or
whatever. And, and yet it

679
00:33:54.770 --> 00:33:57.730
is so obvious that he
is better at speaking into

680
00:33:57.730 --> 00:34:00.550
a microphone than I am
by, by leaps and bounds,

681
00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:03.160
you know, like a million
times, But he's been doing

682
00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:07.030
it since he was 18
or something. Right. Right. I

683
00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:11.140
see anybody had, he probably
had some talent too, whatever

684
00:34:11.140 --> 00:34:14.380
that is some kind of
linguistic talent. I mean, you

685
00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:16.960
know, he probably, he grew
up in Holland and moved

686
00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:19.600
to America and he probably
switched from Dutch to English

687
00:34:19.930 --> 00:34:22.960
at exactly the right age.
So he has absolutely no

688
00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:26.320
accent in English or in
Dutch, You're making this up.

689
00:34:26.350 --> 00:34:29.410
So it's probably happened. Oh
yeah, no, that's true. And,

690
00:34:29.470 --> 00:34:31.270
and, and, and it was
probably at exactly the right

691
00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:34.060
age that gave him sort
of a fluency with language

692
00:34:34.390 --> 00:34:38.020
that is like above and
beyond what mano, like one

693
00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:44.320
language speakers would have. I'm
sorry, but just, You're actually

694
00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:46.630
talking about fluency with language
and how important it is.

695
00:34:46.630 --> 00:34:48.570
And you're like, it's like
much better how like, like

696
00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:55.420
mano, like people who talk
like people who talk, There's

697
00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:58.660
no question that bilingual that
genuinely bi-lingual, Oh, believe me,

698
00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:01.930
my wife speaks English much
more better than I do.

699
00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:06.940
Yeah. And I, I learned
Hebrew a little bit too

700
00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:08.950
late if I had moved
to Israel probably like two

701
00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:11.470
years earlier, I would probably
be a better English speaker.

702
00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:14.710
And so, so that's what
I think it is with.

703
00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:16.960
Yeah. I mean, I don't
want to say that's why

704
00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:18.730
I'm great, but, but there
may be a, you know,

705
00:35:18.730 --> 00:35:23.230
matters of innate talent there.
Well, so Adam Corolla is

706
00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:25.540
a little bit different because
he's got, he's a comedian

707
00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:30.880
and comedians learn certain sketches
that they just repeat again

708
00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:33.370
and again and again. So
Adam Corolla, you're like, you

709
00:35:33.370 --> 00:35:36.670
know, giving me the rant
about the Mexican lawnmower Gardner

710
00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:39.090
dude, and he's got a
rant prepared, did he said

711
00:35:39.090 --> 00:35:41.820
700 times and he's optimized
and he's timed it. And

712
00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:43.800
he's given the same rant
700 times. And every time

713
00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:45.630
it gets a little bit
better, a little bit funnier,

714
00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:47.520
a little bit smoother. And
he just sort of does

715
00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:50.370
that continuously tells those stories
continuously again and again and

716
00:35:50.370 --> 00:35:53.060
again and again. Well, so,
so I'm not sure, but

717
00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:55.160
we may have just recorded
a half an hour that's

718
00:35:55.170 --> 00:35:57.800
we can just call the
sour grapes show as we

719
00:35:58.130 --> 00:36:00.890
There podcasts. Remember the podcast
you and me and Jeff

720
00:36:00.890 --> 00:36:03.410
and Roy did. That was
a really horrible podcast. This

721
00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:06.380
is worse. I think this
may be awful. So this

722
00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:08.930
is very interesting. So I
don't know Leo the port

723
00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:11.570
personally, but I know that
Leo probably did not make

724
00:36:11.570 --> 00:36:14.660
it 35 minutes into this
show. Cause he's busy actually

725
00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:18.020
producing 21 shows himself that
are 10 to one. Do

726
00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:19.610
you want me to try
to arrange a visit where

727
00:36:19.610 --> 00:36:22.330
we, you and I go
to, to his place in

728
00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:25.460
California, Northern California and just
visit him and watch him

729
00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:27.740
do some shows and stuff.
That would be cool. All

730
00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:29.930
right. I'll try to arrange
that Because we're like we're

731
00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:31.850
down here kind of in
the, you know, we're in

732
00:36:31.850 --> 00:36:34.070
the bottom of the food
chain podcast wise, we should,

733
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.830
rather than sitting around talking
about all the things that

734
00:36:36.830 --> 00:36:40.280
we don't, we're not able
to do and, and, and

735
00:36:40.490 --> 00:36:42.260
picking on Leo, we should
just go and find out

736
00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:43.910
how he's doing it. Cause
you can't, this is the

737
00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:47.270
thing you can't argue with
success now. Right? I was,

738
00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:49.370
I was at a, I
was in a presentation recently

739
00:36:49.370 --> 00:36:51.170
and I was talking about
stack overflow. And some of

740
00:36:51.170 --> 00:36:53.990
the stuff technology wise that
you guys were doing that

741
00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:57.590
I thought was weird, but
the thing is you're succeeding.

742
00:36:57.590 --> 00:37:01.670
So who am I to,
to, to complain that? Yeah,

743
00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:04.160
Well, what happens is the
technology is the second order

744
00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:07.340
bit, right? There's a higher,
higher order bit there that

745
00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:09.650
makes stack overflow successful, right?
It's the same thing with

746
00:37:09.650 --> 00:37:13.490
podcasts, you know, how good
our audio quality is is.

747
00:37:14.370 --> 00:37:16.700
And we're, we're, we're really
good at that relative to

748
00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:19.460
some other shows. We remember
the Gilmore gang, which had,

749
00:37:19.610 --> 00:37:21.440
I mean, in that case,
who cares how good the

750
00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:23.810
content was. It was so
impossible to listen to. I

751
00:37:23.810 --> 00:37:25.820
mean, that was a show
where everybody call into a

752
00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:28.010
conference call and the first
15 minutes would be dead

753
00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:31.040
air with just background noises
and Steve Gilmore, like yelling

754
00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:33.140
at a taxi driver because
he was phoning in the

755
00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:34.820
show from a cell phone,
in a taxi in New York

756
00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:37.310
city and the first week
of the met. And you'd

757
00:37:37.310 --> 00:37:39.260
be like, how could anybody
possibly listen to this? This

758
00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:43.810
is inconceivable. Anybody could listen
to this show. So, so

759
00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:46.190
they, they have managed to
have such bad audio quality

760
00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:48.500
that, that dominated everything else.
But in most cases, it's

761
00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:51.020
really the content, not the
auto audio quality. And if

762
00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:53.960
you have a good guest
calling in via phone, it's

763
00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:56.600
going to easily Trump, a
boring guest, you know, who's

764
00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:58.340
right there in the studio
with you or calling him

765
00:37:58.730 --> 00:38:01.520
via Skype or whatever, better,
better form of audio they

766
00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:05.600
have. So that's the, that's
really that the high order

767
00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:07.880
bit, and it's the same
thing with code. Whereas this

768
00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:11.720
technologist and programmers, we constantly
obsess about, you know, what

769
00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:13.670
programming language should I use
and which library should I

770
00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:17.000
use and what object oriented
framework should I use and

771
00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.690
what you know, now it's
gone beyond that to debates

772
00:38:20.690 --> 00:38:23.060
over whether I should use
inversion of control containers and

773
00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:26.240
which ones should I use
an hibernator and what are

774
00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:27.860
all the, what, jeez, what
are all those choices for

775
00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:31.040
different ways of accessing your
database and asp.net? And that

776
00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:33.860
is definitely like the fourth
bit, right? That's a fourth

777
00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:39.670
order bit in the success
of your product. That was

778
00:38:39.670 --> 00:38:41.560
one of the speeches that
makes our podcast. I've worried.

779
00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:45.930
I think so. It's, it's,
it's an interesting idea. I

780
00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:47.970
enjoy doing the show and
I've always said in the

781
00:38:47.970 --> 00:38:50.850
past, whether at that I'm
not blogging for, you know,

782
00:38:50.850 --> 00:38:53.250
success. I'm not blogging for
certainly not blogging for the

783
00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:56.700
Google ad money. Cause there's
not much of that. And

784
00:38:56.700 --> 00:38:58.770
I'd same thing with the
podcast. It's a, it's a

785
00:38:58.770 --> 00:39:00.870
labor of love. And I
know that labor of love

786
00:39:00.870 --> 00:39:03.810
is a, is a cliche,
but it is, we've done

787
00:39:03.810 --> 00:39:07.080
200 plus shows and I'll
keep doing it as long

788
00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:10.740
as these one, person's listening
to it. So I wish

789
00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:12.420
the old, certainly all the
best, but I'd love to

790
00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:15.120
know some of his tricks
to, to get a wide

791
00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:18.030
audience is definitely succeeding. Are
you, do you think you're

792
00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:19.470
going to do your show
kind of in closing, do

793
00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:20.760
you think you're going to
just stop or what are

794
00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:22.920
you gonna do with the
show? I don't want to,

795
00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:26.010
I don't want to repeat
myself too much. And the

796
00:39:26.010 --> 00:39:28.890
original idea of the show
was we're building this new

797
00:39:28.890 --> 00:39:32.220
things that go overflow. Let's
just sort of record the

798
00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:34.560
Genesis of that because it
was neat that Jeff and

799
00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:35.790
I were in different cities.
And so we had to

800
00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:37.950
have regular phone calls to
kind of keep in touch

801
00:39:37.950 --> 00:39:39.240
and build that. And I
sort of thought it would

802
00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:41.040
cost us nothing to hit
the record button while we

803
00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:43.020
were doing that. And somebody
would probably want to listen

804
00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:46.530
to that. And unfortunately over
time, what happened is that

805
00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:49.080
we became kind of, whenever
you do a, you know,

806
00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:50.670
we're the kind of people,
and I'm sure you are

807
00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:52.650
too, that whenever you're doing
something, whether you're doing it

808
00:39:52.650 --> 00:39:55.770
for fun or professionally, you
want to get better and

809
00:39:55.770 --> 00:39:57.300
better at it. And you
want every version to be

810
00:39:57.300 --> 00:39:59.280
like a little bit better.
And so we started, you

811
00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:01.470
know, I started worrying about
how to improve the audio

812
00:40:01.530 --> 00:40:03.690
of the podcast and our
gear got more and more

813
00:40:03.690 --> 00:40:06.810
esoteric as the audio got
better and better. And, you

814
00:40:06.810 --> 00:40:08.520
know, we started having guests
and we started just trying

815
00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:09.900
to think about how to
make it better and better.

816
00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:13.740
And eventually it, it, it
was the, the, the way

817
00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:16.410
to make it better would
be to make that my

818
00:40:16.410 --> 00:40:20.160
job is to spend more
time on it, to practice

819
00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:22.710
more this podcast. Right. So
we've been recording for, I

820
00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:27.270
dunno, 40 minutes or so
now, 42 minutes, if we

821
00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:30.060
go for another hour, you
can probably edit this down

822
00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:32.220
to a much better 30
minute show, but you know,

823
00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:34.350
who's got time. I've got
stuff to do. It's not

824
00:40:34.350 --> 00:40:36.780
my number one priority. It's
my number three priority. So

825
00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:38.700
that's why it's sort of
hard for me to decide

826
00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:42.510
what to do about this
Decker of the podcast. Well,

827
00:40:42.510 --> 00:40:44.980
I think the point about
making it, your job is,

828
00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:47.760
is, is, is the trick.
I, I, this is not

829
00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:50.250
my job. This isn't even
a Microsoft thing. It's just

830
00:40:50.250 --> 00:40:52.110
something that Carl and I
did on the, you know,

831
00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:54.300
kind of do on the
side that my boss tolerates.

832
00:40:56.100 --> 00:40:58.110
So do they, I was
gonna, I was wondering about

833
00:40:58.110 --> 00:40:59.640
that. Does your boss not
expect you to do that?

834
00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:02.490
I mean, you're doing your
remarkable evangelism work for Microsoft

835
00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:08.460
Hansel minutes. Well, what's, what's
the, what's a better word.

836
00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:10.740
I'd rather be a customer
advocate. I'm kind of the

837
00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:16.710
Ralph Nader of.net maybe except
not insane. Yeah, no, The

838
00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:20.610
customer advocate implies that you're
taking customer things and moving

839
00:41:20.610 --> 00:41:23.130
the customer information from customers
and moving it into the

840
00:41:23.130 --> 00:41:27.690
company. Yes. Evangelism implies, right?
Yes. But I mean, Hanselman

841
00:41:27.690 --> 00:41:30.210
that's, if you, if you
cover some obscure in version

842
00:41:30.210 --> 00:41:32.340
of control container that somebody
is working on at Microsoft,

843
00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:35.360
that really is outside ideas
and bring them, sorry, taking

844
00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:37.900
insight ideas from, Yeah. I
mean, technically the show is

845
00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:40.240
about things I'm interested in.
Like I've had engineers from

846
00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:44.110
sun on and I've had,
you know, just the show

847
00:41:44.110 --> 00:41:45.880
is not, I mean, every
once in awhile, if some

848
00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:50.520
cool thing comes out, you
know, a visual studio, I

849
00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:52.720
should do a show, a
visual studio, but it's not

850
00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:55.240
like, I mean, like someone
who has called in the

851
00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:58.090
past and said, Hey, we
have this new obscure thing

852
00:41:58.090 --> 00:42:00.820
where you have us on
your show and I'll say,

853
00:42:00.850 --> 00:42:04.060
Hmm. You know, that's just
not really how this works.

854
00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:05.920
I mean, if it tickles
my, I mean, I'll look

855
00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:07.690
at it and if it's
cool, that's awesome. I'll check

856
00:42:07.690 --> 00:42:10.360
it out. But I don't
have people on the show

857
00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:13.420
that I don't believe about.
And that's why the blog

858
00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:16.810
is on my servers. And
it has my disclaimer and

859
00:42:16.810 --> 00:42:21.100
my copyright and the, the
podcast is the same. And

860
00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:23.920
it's like, I had, what
was his name? I had

861
00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:26.230
Charles Petzold on. Right. Yeah.
You know, and that was

862
00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:27.790
good. That was good episode
yet. And he was like

863
00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:30.700
saying all sorts of stuff
that Microsoft people wouldn't say,

864
00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:32.710
you know, he was like,
Oh yeah, the windows phones

865
00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:34.810
got a black screen because
it's got better battery life.

866
00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:37.210
You know, that's the kind
of stuff you can't get

867
00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:41.800
from a Microsoft program manager
sometimes. Huh. But you will

868
00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:43.720
get from, you know, an
old dude with a beard.

869
00:42:44.410 --> 00:42:46.600
Right. And those are the
kinds of people I'd rather

870
00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:48.370
have on, on the show.
I don't want this to

871
00:42:48.370 --> 00:42:51.190
ever be like a mouthpiece.
And that's why no, absolutely.

872
00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:54.430
That's why we control it.
Yeah. Yeah. So I don't

873
00:42:54.430 --> 00:42:57.400
know. Do, do you think
that you want to be

874
00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:59.950
on a podcast like every
once in a while, and

875
00:42:59.950 --> 00:43:01.870
like you still have something
to say, we should actually

876
00:43:01.870 --> 00:43:04.450
ask the audiences because maybe
they'll say like, in the

877
00:43:04.450 --> 00:43:07.000
comments like that was supposed
to be his farewell show.

878
00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.790
We never want to hear
from him again. Well, I've

879
00:43:09.790 --> 00:43:12.850
already decided that like, like
that I wanted to pull

880
00:43:12.850 --> 00:43:16.660
back from the being a
public persona. First of all,

881
00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:18.490
in the case of blogging
where I basically said, listen,

882
00:43:18.490 --> 00:43:22.360
I've done 10 years of
being a pundit. And I've

883
00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:25.150
actually gotten to the point
where the value I'm providing

884
00:43:25.150 --> 00:43:28.630
to the world through insightful
ideas is now exceeded by

885
00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:31.150
the annoyance that people feel
when I open my mouth,

886
00:43:32.050 --> 00:43:34.300
like those two things for
a while were in balance,

887
00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:36.100
everybody was like, Oh, that's
an interesting idea. Oh, that's

888
00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:38.380
another interesting idea. Oh, that's
a great idea. And it's

889
00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:41.740
like, alright, too many ideas
to OSHA. Well, eventually one

890
00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:47.740
of those surpasses the other
and it, and my bizarro

891
00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:51.880
celebrity in the tiny niche
world of programmers that listen

892
00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:54.460
to podcasts and read blogs,
which is already a small

893
00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:57.190
subset of programmers, which is
already a small subset of

894
00:43:57.190 --> 00:43:59.650
the world, but do it.
But I'm enough of a

895
00:43:59.650 --> 00:44:05.920
celebrity in that weird, bizarre
niche that it's actually, it's

896
00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:08.350
actually a little bit irritating
to me. And I was

897
00:44:08.350 --> 00:44:10.690
trying to kind of pull
it back a little bit

898
00:44:10.690 --> 00:44:13.620
and try to influence the
world in other ways. And

899
00:44:13.630 --> 00:44:16.450
having, having done that for
a while. Well, particularly in

900
00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:19.720
closing, Jeff told me a
story. I thought it was

901
00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:21.940
kind of cool. I may
be one of those things

902
00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:24.610
that's like in the Apocrypha,
but he said that you

903
00:44:24.610 --> 00:44:27.760
guys were at an airport
somewhere wearing stack overflow. T-shirts

904
00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:32.580
what happened During the StackOverflow
dev days. Jeff Atwater and

905
00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:35.730
I were at the San
Francisco airport wearing stack overflow

906
00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:37.380
shirts that we got made
up for the show. So

907
00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:39.420
it's, it was like a
white Oxford shirt with stack

908
00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:42.180
overflow logo and a kid
who looked like he was

909
00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:44.430
20, but he was wearing
a suit. Cause it was

910
00:44:44.430 --> 00:44:45.990
like a college kid on
his way to a job

911
00:44:46.020 --> 00:44:48.150
interview or something comes by
to us. And he's like,

912
00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:52.080
Oh my God, you guys
are from stack overflow. And

913
00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:53.880
I can't remember exactly what
I said, but I'm like,

914
00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:55.980
yeah, you know, I'm Joel
Spolsky, this is Jeff Atwood.

915
00:44:56.310 --> 00:45:00.300
And he's like, who? And
he showed no sign of

916
00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:03.390
ever having heard those names
before. And we're like, yeah,

917
00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:05.820
we're the cofounders of stack
overflow. And he finally said,

918
00:45:06.030 --> 00:45:08.580
Oh yeah. Okay. That's cool.
I like that site. And,

919
00:45:09.090 --> 00:45:10.980
and Mike from Reddit was
there and were like, this

920
00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:12.240
is Mike from Reddit. And
they're like, Oh, I like

921
00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:15.630
read it even more. And
that's really what it's about.

922
00:45:15.630 --> 00:45:18.300
Right? It's not about the
person it's about what the

923
00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:21.900
person puts out there make.
Well, I mean, Joel, Joel

924
00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:25.170
and software regularly, my, my
standard audience, I used to

925
00:45:25.170 --> 00:45:26.700
say, if I were to
write a big blog post,

926
00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.710
I would get anywhere from
a hundred thousand to a

927
00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:30.510
million people are reading it
in a million. This was

928
00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:33.750
a really big one. A
hundred thousand is probably the

929
00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:35.790
number of people that would
have read that thing. Eventually

930
00:45:35.790 --> 00:45:37.830
by the time it made
its way through all the

931
00:45:37.830 --> 00:45:40.650
various different sites. And after
about a month or two,

932
00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:45.180
about a hundred thousand for
typical, a major blog post

933
00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:46.980
where I'm actually thinking of
something and writing about it

934
00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:51.810
and stack overflow regularly reaches
7 million people a month. So,

935
00:45:52.590 --> 00:45:55.050
so that's a, it's just
a different scale altogether. It's,

936
00:45:55.050 --> 00:45:57.210
it's a much larger scale.
There's no possible way that

937
00:45:57.210 --> 00:45:59.880
all those people know who
I am. And, and, and,

938
00:46:00.450 --> 00:46:02.010
and we're reaching them kind
of with different kinds of

939
00:46:02.010 --> 00:46:05.370
information altogether. I'm not telling
you, you programmers should have

940
00:46:05.370 --> 00:46:07.980
private offices. I'm telling you
if you're calling the blah,

941
00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:10.410
blah, blah windows, API function.
And the third argument is

942
00:46:10.410 --> 00:46:12.930
not even though the documentation
said that was okay, and

943
00:46:12.930 --> 00:46:15.000
you're getting a crash three
days later here is why.

944
00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:18.420
And for the 15 people
that have that problem, that's

945
00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:20.310
the information that we're getting
them. So it's a very

946
00:46:20.310 --> 00:46:25.680
different kind of way of
sharing knowledge. I think let's

947
00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:29.070
put it that way. Alright.
This has been another episode

948
00:46:29.070 --> 00:46:32.460
of the stack overflow Hanselman
podcast. This is our second

949
00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:36.930
joint podcast, second joint podcast.
And we'll see you out

950
00:46:36.930 --> 00:46:39.960
to you by brought to
you by conversations once you

951
00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:48.210
buy it by this weekend
stack overflow. All right. Thanks,

952
00:46:48.210 --> 00:46:51.090
Joel, for hanging out with
me, sir. Nice talking to

953
00:46:51.090 --> 00:46:51.380
