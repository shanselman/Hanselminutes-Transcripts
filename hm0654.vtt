Hey friends, we have a
new sponsor today, and I

2
00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.440
want to make sure that
you support them because they

3
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.360
make Hansel minutes possible. Raven
DB, it's a document database

4
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.860
that's non-relational and fully transactional.
It's available for windows and

5
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.660
Linux with official client API
APIs for.net, the JVM go

6
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.500
Ruby, no JS and Python.
Raven DB is designed for

7
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.100
high performance handling tens of
thousands of requests, even on

8
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.400
a single node. Now, Raven
DB is capable of on

9
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.900
the fly optimization, dynamic indexes,
and much more. It has

10
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.690
a fully loaded gooey, which
means it's simpler to operate

11
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.390
and you don't need, you
know, arcane incantations on the

12
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.060
command line. It just works.
It's fast and it's right.

it out. Hi, this is

15
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.160
Scott Hanselman. This is another
episode of Hansel minutes. And

16
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.790
today I'm talking with Lynn
tie from key values.com. How

17
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.430
are you So good. I'm
excited. You are an engineer.

18
00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.380
You learn to code a
couple of years ago, but

19
00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.840
before that you were a
PhD candidate with a background

20
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.400
in neuroscience That is correct.
Previous life of mine. You've

21
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.880
done freelance web development and
you also done neuroscience. So

22
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.670
you kind of understand the
tech mind as well as

23
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.510
maybe how techies I think.
Yeah. And strangely, I feel

24
00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.270
like in general, I've always
been kind of drawn to

25
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.780
the types of people who
were more classically stereotypically into

26
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.720
tech, but yeah, lots of
weirdos and science and tech.

27
00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.940
When we, as, as weirdos
in tech, as we, as

28
00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.470
techies, try to find a
place We're forced to go

29
00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.880
to jobs, boards and search
with keywords and we find

30
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.460
our tribe. Yeah. I mean,
I think a lot of

31
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.460
people don't actually even try
to find their tribe that

32
00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.770
way because they know there's,
it's hard to do that.

33
00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.400
That's such a good segue.
Yeah. I think about this

34
00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.740
all the time. And I
think the hardest part actually

35
00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.620
is weirdly when you're trying
to find your tribe and

36
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.360
you've already kind of set
out on a path and

37
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.880
it's heading in a way
that it's farther and farther

38
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.310
from the place you'd actually
like to be, it's really

39
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.370
hard to kind of correct.
And do like, you know,

40
00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.950
a complete one 80 or,
you know, hard, hard turn

41
00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.210
looking at job boards is
certainly sometimes the last place

42
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.180
you'd go. Yeah. Well, what's,
what's a way to find

43
00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.710
out, is it, is it
just to have as many

44
00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.650
interviews as possible because even
those interviews come out really

45
00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.170
awkward? Well, I guess there's
like a few steps I'm

46
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.120
thinking like, just in terms
of like, where, what do

47
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.550
you want to do day
to day? And so like,

48
00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.500
obviously, so, you know, I
think about this a lot

49
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.900
with key values, cause it's
very specific to finding an

50
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.290
engineering job, but I mean,
just since you talked about,

51
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.200
you know, I was previously
a PhD candidate, I dropped

52
00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.540
out. That's very, very sad
for my entire family, but

53
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.940
I think just at a
bigger level, like a higher

54
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.040
level of like, what career
do you want to do?

55
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.390
And like what, what do
you want to do day

56
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.090
to day? And like, if
you're doing, if you're, you

57
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.800
know, a web developer now,
like what if you want

58
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.400
to be a landscaper or
something like wildly different? I

59
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.250
think that's something that actually
probably for a lot of

60
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.340
people, it does come from
having lots of conversations, but

61
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.160
also just trial and error
and kind of, I mean,

62
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.310
yeah, there's no real shortcut
to just the experience of

63
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.080
knowing what you want and
don't want what you like

64
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.270
and what you don't like.
So it depends on what

65
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.870
level you're talking about here.
Right? Well, when, when people

66
00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.290
go to key values.com, they
see, it says find an

67
00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.900
engineering team that shares your
values and you pick some

68
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.410
values here and the values
are, are pretty diverse. Like

69
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.340
there's an engineering section, but
you're really expressing like what

70
00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.730
you care about. And you're
hoping that that company also

71
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.930
cared about that. There's places
like, yeah, we pair program,

72
00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.030
you know, we do, you
know, extreme programming or we

73
00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.830
have a high quality code
base. Those are all things

74
00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.780
that, you know, I could
care about. But like I

75
00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.730
love some of these, one
of them is like light

76
00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.510
meetings. Like we value we
as a company care about

77
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.290
not doing a lot of
meetings. Yeah. No, I think

78
00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.290
they're, it's a whole, for
me, the reason why I

79
00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.180
started this is when I
was looking for jobs. So

80
00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.000
yeah, as you mentioned, I
was a freelancer at some

81
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.150
point I was like, Hmm,
maybe I should get a

82
00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.310
full time job and be
a full time employee somewhere.

83
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.040
And when I sat down
to look like, I mean,

84
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.290
you mentioned this job boards
was one place I went

85
00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:31.410
and they don't have anything
like this. Like not at

86
00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.870
all. It's like, what tech
stack do you work with?

87
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.750
What job title might you
want? And like what industry,

88
00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.780
broad strokes, like, like education
or health. And those are

89
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.210
like, I mean, that's nice
to be able to filter,

90
00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.760
I think to some degree,
but it's really more like,

91
00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.500
what is my day to
day? It doesn't matter if

92
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.530
it's like my favorite industry
and using my favorite technology.

93
00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.150
If I have meetings every
day, I'm going to hate

94
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.650
it. So yeah, this was
kind of trying to, I

95
00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.750
talked to tons of people
and just figuring out what

96
00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.810
are the actual things that
make someone love their job

97
00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.180
or hate their job, or,
you know, make them start

98
00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.460
wondering if there are new
jobs that they should consider.

99
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.400
And it's it's yeah. Something
is something like light meetings

100
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.790
is totally. Yeah. It's very
real. And, and I, I

101
00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:13.980
think that there's this term,
we hear a lot in

102
00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:18.330
engineering, which has culture fit.
And sometimes I feel that

103
00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.890
that is abused. That term
cultural fit is like, well,

104
00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:25.110
you know, Lynn's not really
kind of like our kind

105
00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.840
of people, like what does
that even mean? Right. It

106
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.570
feels like you're trying to
quantify that and give it

107
00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:34.080
meaning. Yeah. I mean, I
think for sure, I mean,

108
00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.030
to be honest, before I
started key values, I didn't

109
00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:40.260
realize that the term culture
fit is just totally rejected

110
00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.560
by a lot of people
in, in the people space,

111
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.550
talent, space, HR, definitely in
the DNI space, because it's

112
00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.610
something that you can kind
of for a not valid

113
00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.070
reason, say it's just not
a good culture. You're not

114
00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:56.610
a good culture fit. And
it's, you know, yeah. It's,

115
00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:59.510
it's an umbrella that covers
all good and bad things,

116
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.170
but this is definitely, it's
not so much what I

117
00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:05.570
would call culture fit is
more just like value alignment.

118
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:09.350
I think that people that
you might not necessarily want

119
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:11.720
to be friends with or
live with, or hang out,

120
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.390
you know, outside and on
the weekends with, but they

121
00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:16.940
might be someone who really,
really genuinely enjoy working with

122
00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.850
you are compatible in that
sense. And so I think

123
00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:24.380
it's, it's more, yeah. I
mean, it is fit, but

124
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:26.510
yeah, I guess I'm moving
away from that term as

125
00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:29.080
well. Yeah. Well, I like
that. I mean like, so

126
00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.590
w when you said value
alignment, like my first internal

127
00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:35.620
reaction was like, that sounds
like an MBA kind of

128
00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:38.140
suit term. Like, you know,
I would never say value

129
00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:41.140
alignment, like casually at a
dinner party, but at the

130
00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:45.440
same time, that's precise. It
is exactly what it is

131
00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:48.310
exactly what it is. So
I need to get over

132
00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:51.850
my, my that's a suit
term and they say, yeah,

133
00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:54.640
I want their values to
align with mine. I always

134
00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:56.860
like to joke with my
wife when you're trying to

135
00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:59.800
meet someone like I've met,
my wife is a, you,

136
00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.680
you have emotional baggage, right?
So you just want someone

137
00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:07.960
whose baggage matches your baggage
Pretty much, actually. I've never

138
00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.480
thought about it that way,
but it's, that's pretty accurate.

139
00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:12.640
And it's just like, do
you care about the same

140
00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.050
things are, you know, it's
the simplest way of saying

141
00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:18.430
it. Yeah. The amount of
w I'm going to gush

142
00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:20.050
a little bit, the amount
of work that has been

143
00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:24.340
put into these, these categories
or these tags, I'm not

144
00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:26.410
really quite sure what you
would call them. These values,

145
00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:28.810
really the amount of work
has been put into the

146
00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:32.460
text behind them is huge.
Do you have a background

147
00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:39.940
in HR because you've really
I'm washing. No, thank you.

148
00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:43.630
I do not have a
background in HR or recruiting.

149
00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:47.830
I am. Yeah. As you
said, I'm a, you know,

150
00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:53.530
PhD, dropout turned developer turned
into yeah. Whatever, you know,

151
00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:57.130
just trying to help other
people navigate their job, search

152
00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:02.290
and navigate their career also.
But no, I think it's,

153
00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:05.020
I've always enjoyed writing. So
it's been nice to find

154
00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:06.520
an outlet for it. I
think there was a good

155
00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:09.460
amount of writing in my,
my research days. Cause you

156
00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:12.130
know, you obviously publish papers,
but it's a different type

157
00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:14.140
of writing. Yeah. It is
a different kind of writing.

158
00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:16.540
And there, there are, there
are terms here. So when

159
00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:18.670
you go to key values.com
and you hover over them,

160
00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:22.600
there is a, like a
tool tip that'll that'll pop

161
00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.930
up, that'll give you even
more context. So there's, there's

162
00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:27.940
multiple layers to these things.
It's not just keywords. Right.

163
00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:31.240
So if I go and
hover over, you know, work

164
00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.280
life balance, like we all
know what that means, but

165
00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.500
I can hover over it.
And then key values.com will

166
00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:40.690
say like, what does key
values.com mean? Well, we mean,

167
00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:43.810
it says engineers have the
flexibility and freedom and support

168
00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:47.110
to be fulfilled and enjoy
both their personal and professional

169
00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:49.960
lives. Okay, good. That aligns
with my understanding of what

170
00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:54.010
like work life balance means.
Yeah. It's funny. Actually, I

171
00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.100
made those tool tips in
the very beginning, I think

172
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.650
before I'd even launched key
values last year in September,

173
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:03.060
but in a way I
feel like all of these

174
00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:07.350
terms are very vague and
the whole point of looking

175
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:10.320
at companies and how they
define them is to dig

176
00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:13.290
into that work life balance
is like, like could not

177
00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:16.230
have been a better example.
I think it's like, it's

178
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:18.270
easy for us to all
agree. Like we all know

179
00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:20.160
what that is and what
that looks like, but it's

180
00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.640
actually really easy to be
on the wrong page or

181
00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:26.970
on a different page. So,
so that's something that I

182
00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:28.860
is like a perfect example.
So I think a lot

183
00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:30.780
of people consider work life
balance to be, you know,

184
00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:33.090
you work 40 hours or
less a week. That seems

185
00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:37.080
reasonable. I think that's a
fair statement. Yes. Yeah, yeah.

186
00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:39.350
You're right. It's a little
lower actually in other European

187
00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:44.030
countries. But for me, I
actually would find it much

188
00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:47.660
easier to balance my life
if I worked longer, but

189
00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:50.270
have the ability to choose
when and where I worked.

190
00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:53.150
So like, you know, like
a nine to five where

191
00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:56.090
I have to be in
seat at a certain place

192
00:09:56.420 --> 00:10:00.020
is V like it's feels
oppressive for me. And I

193
00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:02.090
don't know why that's, you
know, I have no idea

194
00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:03.860
why, where that came from.
I think it's just something

195
00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:06.560
about who I am in
a way. That's why I

196
00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:09.170
was also drawn to science.
Like you just go to

197
00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:11.420
the lab when you do.
And it doesn't matter when,

198
00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:16.460
and so it's, it's, it's
definitely an easy trap for

199
00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:19.490
a candidate and a company
to think they align. And

200
00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:22.010
if you don't talk about
what that actually looks like

201
00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:25.010
and means for each, each
party, it's, it's, you know,

202
00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:27.530
you can see how that
would potentially be a disaster,

203
00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:30.800
but yeah. So I think
kind of the goal is

204
00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:34.010
really to have companies and
teams talk about what it

205
00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:37.130
means to them. And I,
every company that I work

206
00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:39.920
with it's really like, it
happens every single time without

207
00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:42.500
fail. They'll say like, you
know, I mean, it's, it's

208
00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:45.860
pretty like standard. We do
X and I'm like, Whoa,

209
00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:48.170
Whoa, Whoa. Like that's not
standard. Like a lot of

210
00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:50.480
companies don't do that. So
it's, it's funny to just

211
00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.820
kind of step back and
think about how, you know,

212
00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:56.480
the traditions or practices or
processes that you do at

213
00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:00.710
one company may, or maybe,
actually probably maybe one on

214
00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:02.420
one end of the spectrum
and no other company does

215
00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:04.220
that. But if that's all,
you know, it's easy to

216
00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:07.610
think that's standard And you've
called out work life balance

217
00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:10.400
and separated it from things
like flexible work arrangements with,

218
00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.410
like you said, it would
be more, maybe more appropriate

219
00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:16.010
or an additive, a characteristic
on top of that. So

220
00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:19.640
flexible work arrangements, you know,
flexibility in work hours and

221
00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:24.860
locations. Yeah, exactly. I think
the work life balance, I

222
00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:27.320
mean, it's interesting. I mean,
it's so obvious to me

223
00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:29.270
cause I've looked at this,
but a lot of companies

224
00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:31.670
will kind of, after talking
about it with them, feel

225
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:35.960
much more comfortable choosing one
or the other though at

226
00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.330
first they kind of just
grouped them as one thing

227
00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:39.980
as being like, yeah, we
have, we all have balanced

228
00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:42.380
lives, but that's just like
too vague. So that's always,

229
00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:44.060
it's my job to kind
of just dig and dig.

230
00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:47.060
Yeah. And I appreciate that.
It also appears, and this

231
00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:49.790
is me reading into a
lot of this that you

232
00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:54.940
are also catering this to
people at all levels. Like

233
00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:57.040
I could see as a
relatively senior engineer where I

234
00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.410
could go in there and
I could say, yeah, fast

235
00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:05.050
paced environment, continuous delivery, continuous
feedback, awesome. Senior engineer. But

236
00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:09.220
you've got things like wears
many hats like engineers have

237
00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:12.130
a broad set of responsibilities
and can learn from other

238
00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:17.230
groups. You've got a cross
department collaboration where engineers work

239
00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:21.520
directly alongside their peers in
other departments, as well as

240
00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:24.730
internal mobility and promotes with,
from within, which are all

241
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.910
values that a junior or
a starting engineer might care

242
00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:33.570
about. Yeah. It's funny. I
think, you know, so I

243
00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:35.910
was, I, in some ways
still consider myself to be

244
00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:38.490
on the junior side. I,
when I started this though

245
00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:41.190
I created key values. I
was really thinking about the

246
00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:46.350
more like maybe mid levels
to engineers and starting there.

247
00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:49.740
But I do think there's
been self selection in terms

248
00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:51.750
of like who it resonates
with. And I think a

249
00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:56.100
lot of senior engineers actually,
because they've had, you know,

250
00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:58.770
three to four jobs already
or, you know, and they've

251
00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:00.750
kind of learned the hard
way, what they like. And

252
00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:04.080
don't like, like this really
speaks to them. And then

253
00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:07.590
for junior engineers, maybe I've
noticed not necessarily college grads,

254
00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:10.920
but people who have changed
careers, like, like me, someone

255
00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:14.670
who's already had work experience,
not necessarily as a software

256
00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:18.390
engineer, but they've had work
experience enough to know what

257
00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:21.450
they like or don't like.
And so it does cater

258
00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:24.960
to different levels of experience
with, with engineering. But I

259
00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:28.740
think it does speak to
people who've had more, more

260
00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:32.280
experienced period in terms of
like working with different types

261
00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:37.110
of people, under different structures,
at different company sizes, all

262
00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:39.600
of those things. True. You
have to know what, like,

263
00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:41.280
if you don't know what
you don't know, that can

264
00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:43.500
be challenging, but if you
have a general sense of

265
00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:45.120
like, well, I, I feel
that this would be a

266
00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:47.550
good thing. In my experience
in past jobs, that's been

267
00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:49.650
a good thing. I would
be able to, to pick

268
00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:51.810
the values that I care
about. Yeah. And now that

269
00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:53.280
I'm thinking about it, I
actually don't know if that's

270
00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:55.830
a fair statement to make.
Obviously there's people, you know,

271
00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:57.690
you can be young, this
could be your first job

272
00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:00.330
and you might know, but
I think there's definitely a

273
00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:06.150
trend where people right out
of college are oftentimes optimizing

274
00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:12.210
for company reputation and salary
and that's fair. But I

275
00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:14.310
think, and to be honest,
I think that's what a

276
00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:17.280
lot of other job boards
cater to. And that was

277
00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:19.410
kind of where I saw
that there was this gap.

278
00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:24.420
Right. But yeah, I actually,
it's funny people, people don't

279
00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:27.280
always walk with me to
like, come along this, this

280
00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:31.710
comparison of dating and job
searching, but I there's a

281
00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:33.690
lot of, there's a lot
of parallels and I kind

282
00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:35.760
of think about it, like
when you're young, you kind

283
00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:38.370
of like fantasize about dating
the most popular person in

284
00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:42.090
school and like that's what
matters. Yeah. And I think

285
00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:43.590
it's kind of similar when
you get your first all,

286
00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:45.450
like, you want to work
at the Googles and the

287
00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:47.640
Facebooks cause your parents know
about them and your friends

288
00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:50.430
know about them and you
know, people recognize that name.

289
00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:53.990
And I think it's just
like, you're, I mean, then

290
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:55.700
you have that experience and
then you kind of learn

291
00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:57.890
and then you're like, okay,
that's not the most important

292
00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:00.370
thing that matters. Right. Right.
And it's interesting because your

293
00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:03.880
values that you've chosen here
show in fact that you

294
00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:06.610
don't have anything of like
getting paid the most or

295
00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:09.730
super popular company, like those
aren't values that one can

296
00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:13.330
even check. Yeah. That was,
and I it's probably when

297
00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:16.360
I first launched not having
salary was by far the

298
00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:19.900
most popular request, but I
think there's lots of other

299
00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:22.450
places that list that. And
that's pretty much the most

300
00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:24.760
important part of those job
boards and those job sites.

301
00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:29.110
So yeah. There's Well, you've
chosen, you've chosen actively not

302
00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:34.030
to touch that. I have.
Yeah. A little, little controversial

303
00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:37.930
for some, I don't know.
It's polarizing Opportunities though, to

304
00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:41.650
keep things different, right. This
is, this is not just

305
00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:44.230
a regular world job board
where I can go and

306
00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:46.180
put in a, you know,
it's not a front end

307
00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:48.520
with text boxes over a
SQL query where it's like,

308
00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:52.570
if salary greater than <inaudible>
and remote, okay. This is

309
00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:55.540
not that job board. Right.
It is not. And to

310
00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:58.000
be honest, I think it's
also just like, at least

311
00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.340
for how it is right
now in 2018, like it

312
00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:03.310
is, you are, if you're
a software engineer, you're going

313
00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:07.630
to make a decent salary
like this, the idea, I

314
00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:09.730
mean, you can, you definitely
can you, it might not

315
00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:11.920
be your favorite job, but
you can definitely find one

316
00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:14.950
that will pay pretty well
or very well or ridiculously

317
00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:18.520
well, so I think on
the range of what salary

318
00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:22.000
can be, that's just actually
pretty narrow. Like, you know,

319
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.280
let's say it's anywhere. This
is let's, let's be extreme.

320
00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:28.270
Let's anywhere from 50 K
to 500 K Pretty wide

321
00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:32.470
range, But that's just one
dimension, right? Like I think

322
00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:35.740
everything else about, you know,
how you work, who you're

323
00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:38.140
working with, like why you
work that way together, what

324
00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:41.380
opportunities are there? Like just,
I think that there's so

325
00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:43.570
much more there that that's
kind of where I want

326
00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:47.200
to. Yeah. Yeah. It also
appears that you force, or

327
00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:49.990
you encourage maybe, maybe force
isn't the right word. The

328
00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:52.390
companies that sign up to
write a nontrivial amount of

329
00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:56.140
pros. Like there's a lot
here when, when they click.

330
00:16:56.170 --> 00:16:59.260
Yeah. We're good for junior
ed junior devs, they have

331
00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.210
to write something. There's a
lot of texts. Like I'm

332
00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:03.490
looking at five, six pages
of texts about a company

333
00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:06.850
right now. Yeah. It's a
it's it's you're right. Forces

334
00:17:06.850 --> 00:17:08.230
may be strong, but it
is kind of true. I,

335
00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:11.980
I, I do. And this
is like, this is the

336
00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:17.380
part that's really interesting companies.
So there's many, many more

337
00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:20.170
companies that have submitted their
values to key values and

338
00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:25.030
then they've actually show and
it's because when, when push

339
00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:27.190
comes to shove and I
say like, you chose your,

340
00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:30.430
your team is diverse. Great.
Prove it. Like, let's talk

341
00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:32.950
about it. Diverse. In what
way is it just on

342
00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:35.290
your engineering team is across
your whole org. Like what

343
00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:37.510
kind of like, why is
this important? How do you

344
00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:39.430
promote it? How do you,
you know, and when I

345
00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:41.920
start asking these questions, people
realize like, okay, maybe we're

346
00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:46.210
actually not that diverse. And
then discussion with the team

347
00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:47.860
that when I work with
them, they realize like, maybe

348
00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:51.660
we're not actually quite ready
put this together. It seems

349
00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:53.490
like we're not on the
same page about what we

350
00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:58.080
care about most. And so
there's, that's as much filtering

351
00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:01.260
as there is, but yeah,
it's, I definitely feel like

352
00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:04.110
my job is to ask
all the questions that a

353
00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:07.440
candidate wants to ask, but
might not feel comfortable asking.

354
00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:13.110
Interesting. So yeah. I mean,
there's, I think like for

355
00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:15.780
example, actually just work life
balance and diversity. Those are

356
00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:20.030
two great examples where you
might not feel like you

357
00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:26.430
ha you're you're worried about
what might the interviewer interpret

358
00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:29.390
that right. By may there,
when you ask a question

359
00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:31.910
there's always, or often an
implication of there's a question

360
00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:35.840
under the question. Yes. And
if you are new in

361
00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:37.940
the, in the biz or
you don't, you want to

362
00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:40.130
get the answer, but at
the same time, you don't

363
00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:42.530
want it to spiral in
a direction that you don't

364
00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:45.170
want it to go. That
can be really challenging. Exactly.

365
00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:46.880
And it's just, you know,
you're in a vulnerable state

366
00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:49.580
when you're interviewing, so I
think it can be hard.

367
00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:53.690
Yeah. Yeah. And you're being
evaluated. It's just, yeah. So

368
00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:57.140
it's, it's really like, I
see it as my job

369
00:18:57.140 --> 00:19:00.230
as asking all of those
tough questions. Cause I don't

370
00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:01.820
have it, you know, I
can be much more blunt.

371
00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:04.610
Yeah. A big thank you
to our sponsors because they

372
00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:07.010

E L E R I

387
00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:05.150
k.com/hanselman. I'm one of the
sections of, of key values.com

388
00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:07.130
that I enjoy the most
that I almost feel like

389
00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:10.400
should be even more called
out. If I can give

390
00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:14.840
you actual feedback while we're
doing is at the top,

391
00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:17.660
it says culture queries up
next to the top menu

392
00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:20.360
is just like about blog
and submit, click on culture

393
00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:22.670
queries. And I'm just going
to pick a couple of

394
00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:25.280
things that I care about.
Okay. Committed to personal growth

395
00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:29.000
promotes from within, and we'll
say opensource contributor. Okay. And

396
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.150
then I hit see results.
And this isn't a list

397
00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:36.110
of companies. This is a
list of questions for me

398
00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:39.470
to potentially ask at the
job interview. So you're literally

399
00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:43.010
giving me, I can print
these out and like ask

400
00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:45.320
these questions. You give me
the questions and you tell

401
00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:49.210
me why I should fact
ask those questions. And this

402
00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:51.940
is, I feel like a
hidden, valuable, like a hidden,

403
00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:54.490
but not in your face
valuable part of your site.

404
00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:56.590
I was so impressed with
this and that's one of

405
00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:58.330
the primary reasons that I
wanted you on the show.

406
00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:02.640
Well, thanks. Yeah, I you're
right. I should probably highlight

407
00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:05.130
that more. Maybe you'll see
some changes to my site

408
00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:09.060
very soon. No. Yeah. I
mean, I was just going

409
00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:11.220
to say that, like in
talking about how I ask

410
00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:13.590
the tough questions and I
can ask questions, more bluntly

411
00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:16.380
to the companies I work
with. I mean, obviously there

412
00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:19.740
are people who it's true,
you shouldn't ask so bluntly.

413
00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:22.890
And so I kind of
wanted to just create a

414
00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:26.580
resource that I would have,
you know, I would have

415
00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:28.530
used and will continue to
use if I ever look

416
00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:30.960
for jobs, you know, and
something that is kind of

417
00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:34.770
timeless, but I'm just thinking
about how to really get

418
00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:38.610
the answers you're looking for
and make sure to interview

419
00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:42.300
the companies like interviews are
two-sided is a two way

420
00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:45.270
street. And I think so
many people forget this and

421
00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:48.240
it's, it's, it's kind of,
you know, in a way

422
00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:49.830
it's kind of your fault.
Then if you end up

423
00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:52.320
at a company and you're
not happy, if you could

424
00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:54.870
have just maybe asked a
few questions during the interview

425
00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:57.960
process and flush those out,
then, you know, you would

426
00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:00.750
have maybe not taken that
offer. So Yeah, it's so

427
00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:03.000
important. And also, I also
remind people who are interviewing

428
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.030
anytime I give interviewing tips
is that if at all

429
00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:08.700
possible, try to make sure
that you're interviewing the person

430
00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:11.670
who will be in fact,
your boss, because so often

431
00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:14.220
they put us through a
loop of people. Like here's

432
00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:16.500
a pile of nine people
who are going to interview

433
00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:19.320
you and then you'll meet
your boss on like day

434
00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:23.430
four, after you've gone through
new employee, that boss has

435
00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:25.620
to be part of your
interview loop or you're going

436
00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:27.960
to have problems. Yeah. Yes.
That's. I think that is

437
00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:31.590
very good advice and yeah,
it's surprising how often that

438
00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:34.170
might happen Indeed. So I've
gone there and I've clicked

439
00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:38.130
on open source contributor and
engaged with community. And I

440
00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:41.400
love this particular question here.
You say, how did your

441
00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:45.810
team come to use your
current framework? Okay, great. Great

442
00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:49.290
question. But then you explain
why, why would I phrase

443
00:22:49.290 --> 00:22:51.480
it like that and phrasing
matters. And this is, I

444
00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:55.740
think where your neuro science
background comes in, It's useful

445
00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:59.220
for something. Well, you say
engineers are defensive. If you

446
00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:03.840
say, why did you choose
X? Like justify angular. Those

447
00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:05.760
questions can be like an
attack and they, that could

448
00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:10.050
make your interview go South.
Yeah. I've I've actually heard,

449
00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:12.150
I had a friend, this
one, this question actually came

450
00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:14.550
from a friend who was
like, yeah, don't ask it

451
00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:18.420
this way. Cause I did.
And I really insulted my

452
00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:21.420
interviewer and yeah, you can
imagine how the rest of

453
00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:24.450
the day went. Yeah. I
feel like there's a huge

454
00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:25.980
amount of work here on
the one where I put

455
00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:28.950
in fo for junior devs.
Is this good for junior

456
00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:32.340
devs? Or does it promote
from within you say, did

457
00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:35.910
any of your senior engineers
today start out as junior

458
00:23:35.910 --> 00:23:39.510
engineers? What a good sneaky
question. That's like a question

459
00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:44.730
grenade I'm like, see what
happens. Yeah, no, I think

460
00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:47.240
all of questions are, I
think the main thing is

461
00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:49.790
there. Okay. Let me just
take a step back. There's

462
00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:52.760
a lot of generic questions
that you can ask and

463
00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:55.580
your interviewers have been asked
them hundreds of times and

464
00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:58.970
they have like, they basically
open up their chest and

465
00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:01.490
they press play because they've
answered that same question over

466
00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:04.580
and over. And it's like,
you don't want a canned

467
00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:07.460
response. Like you don't want
them to have rehearsed a

468
00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:10.160
response. So I think a
lot of the questions, the

469
00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:11.660
way that I see the
angle that I'm coming from

470
00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:15.770
is to ask something that's
specific enough and different enough

471
00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:18.650
that you're, you're going to
get a very authentic answer

472
00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:21.110
cause your is answering it
on the spot. And so

473
00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:24.260
this is a great example
of that and yeah, it's

474
00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:26.900
true. Like if you, if
your company says that you

475
00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:29.120
promote from within, like, you
better have examples of it.

476
00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:34.900
Exactly. And I like that
you are, it's like, if

477
00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:36.640
you ever see famous people,
like, you know that people

478
00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:38.890
from like the Avengers movies
and they're like, they're doing

479
00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:41.650
their junket right. Where they're
like, they're standing in front

480
00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:44.050
of a, of a screen.
Everyone's asking him the same

481
00:24:44.050 --> 00:24:45.630
dumb questions about like, what's
it like to be on

482
00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:48.520
iron man? Is it fundable?
Right? And then every once

483
00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:51.610
in a while the interviewer
will ask a question and

484
00:24:51.610 --> 00:24:55.090
then the person who's answered
a thousand dumb questions before

485
00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:57.490
it goes, Oh, if I
put a great question and

486
00:24:57.490 --> 00:25:00.400
they light up, so you
were saying, you can get

487
00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:02.830
the interviewer like really on
your side by asking a

488
00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:06.310
thoughtful question. Oh my goodness.
Yeah. So when I launched

489
00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:09.460
culture queries, I had like
met multiple people in the

490
00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:12.010
days following say like, Oh,
it came at perfect time.

491
00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:14.710
And they asked, they know
they had interviews and the

492
00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:17.560
interviewers would respond. Like the
feedback was like, I was

493
00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:20.530
really impressed by your questions.
And it's like, that's, it's

494
00:25:20.530 --> 00:25:22.510
so true. Like you can
make such a good impression

495
00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:26.580
by having thoughtful questions and
you can be interviewing the

496
00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:30.880
company and you can actually
have more information to make

497
00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:32.680
a good decision about whether
or not to work there.

498
00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:36.100
And so it's like everyone
wins. So I've, so I've

499
00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:38.200
gushed. I'm sure people who
are listening are annoyed. Like,

500
00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:39.990
you know, Scott's been gushing
about this site. Why don't

501
00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:41.560
you go check it out
for yourself? Maybe you'll gush

502
00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:43.780
as well, but surely you
didn't write all of these

503
00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:46.270
yourself. You must've had a
community that worked with you

504
00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:49.330
or feedback, or like this
is a, an iterative process,

505
00:25:49.330 --> 00:25:52.120
right? You update questions, add
new things and talk to

506
00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:59.590
people. Actually I wrote probably
98% of it. It just,

507
00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:01.600
I just sat down and
made. It was like a

508
00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:03.910
full time job for a
couple of weeks, but I

509
00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:07.660
definitely got help and guidance.
And I, you know, I

510
00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:11.380
think, yeah. I mean, I,
to be fair, I think

511
00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:13.750
I've just been talking to
a lot of interviewers and

512
00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:15.910
engineers for the months leading
up to it that it

513
00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:18.730
kind of made me, it
was like, my brain was

514
00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:21.490
ready for this, but I
definitely got help from friends.

515
00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:25.570
Some help from friends and
yeah. Other, especially for spaces

516
00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:31.210
that I wasn't particularly well
versed in like the diversity,

517
00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:35.050
anything around diversity inclusion, even,
you know, even though I

518
00:26:35.050 --> 00:26:38.980
am a woman and apparently
I'm a person of color,

519
00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:42.340
I didn't know this until
like, that's embarrassing maybe to

520
00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:44.880
some, but I actually know
that I counted as that.

521
00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:47.310
Like, I'm just not well
versed in that space. So

522
00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:50.210
I definitely got some help
there. Great. So you do

523
00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:51.740
your, the work is being
put into this and then

524
00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:54.200
you're of course applying your
thoughts and understanding around how,

525
00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:56.330
you know, neuroscience, like when
you talk to someone and

526
00:26:56.330 --> 00:26:58.490
you express something in a
certain way, how will that

527
00:26:58.490 --> 00:27:02.360
person take that? And as
you bounce back and forth,

528
00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:04.700
because like you pointed out
it is a two sided

529
00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:09.650
experience, a job interview. Yeah.
It's funny. I feel like

530
00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:13.610
neuroscience itself. I'm not sure
if that, maybe that was

531
00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:16.040
like too deep, but definitely,
you know, in, in college

532
00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:22.040
I took social psychology and
other classes around what makes

533
00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:26.690
like showing vulnerability and showing
interest in someone personally. Of

534
00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:29.810
course those are just, it
sounds obvious, but people, especially

535
00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:32.060
when you're nervous in an
interview, you'll, you'll choke up

536
00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:35.720
and forget about that. But,
Well, I think it's an

537
00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:38.510
important reminder though. Like I
think that we all go

538
00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:40.790
into interviews and job interviews
and we've had, for those

539
00:27:40.790 --> 00:27:43.460
of us, who've had dozens
of them for lack of

540
00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:47.060
a better word. We go
in on autopilot, you know,

541
00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:50.450
and taking a moment and
reminding yourself of sure. Maybe

542
00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:53.660
this is obvious. Maybe it's
not, but when you talk

543
00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:56.210
to people, it, it hits
them a certain way. It

544
00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:59.540
lands the way that you,
the words you choose land

545
00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:02.810
a certain way. Yeah. No,
that's so true. I, I

546
00:28:02.810 --> 00:28:05.150
forgot what that's like. I
mean, for some people they

547
00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:07.730
do dozens of interviews a
week. Like if that's your

548
00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:11.390
job as a hiring manager,
so you're right. It does,

549
00:28:11.450 --> 00:28:14.600
you kind of do go
on autopilot, but ultimately, I

550
00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:20.660
mean, we have a pretty
limited time on earth and

551
00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:25.010
many of those are sleeping.
So just thinking about like,

552
00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:29.750
what, how you want to
spend your waking hours. It's

553
00:28:29.970 --> 00:28:32.240
I think everyone feels this
way. Like you want to

554
00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:35.150
work with people you're excited
to work with and learn

555
00:28:35.150 --> 00:28:39.200
from. And I think everyone
really cares about this. So

556
00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:43.160
even though, especially for software
engineers, like the technical interviews

557
00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:46.550
are so much about, can
you do the thing there's

558
00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:49.370
so much about like doing
it side by side with

559
00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:52.130
people you like and can
work with and can learn

560
00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:55.190
from. And so I think
there's, it's easy to forget

561
00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:57.530
about that second part. I
like the way you phrase

562
00:28:57.530 --> 00:29:00.680
that though, like there is,
there is the important, can

563
00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:04.250
you do the thing? Like
I like that's above all.

564
00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:06.080
You're going to come here.
I'm going to give you

565
00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:08.780
money. You will pay the
rent with your money as

566
00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:11.810
long as you do the
thing. Right. But this is

567
00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:13.910
less about doing the thing,
but like, while you're doing

568
00:29:13.910 --> 00:29:15.920
it, will you enjoy it?
Will you like the people?

569
00:29:16.130 --> 00:29:18.140
Will it, will it get
you up in the morning?

570
00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:19.760
Will you be totally sad
about getting up in the

571
00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:23.660
morning? Like those are really
important aspects. That's the values

572
00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:25.100
that you need to make
sure it aligns with whether

573
00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:27.350
or not they use, you
know, dot net or rails

574
00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:30.290
or whether or not they
have remotes or not. Are

575
00:29:30.290 --> 00:29:33.230
you going to enjoy doing
the thing? Exactly. And I

576
00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:36.140
think it's, so the other
thing that I've talked about

577
00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:38.630
with key values is like,
there's this assumption that you

578
00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:41.890
have the luxury to choose.
And I, and I know

579
00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:44.740
that it's like, it can
be frustrating to hear a

580
00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:47.710
very privileged person complain about
how many options they have

581
00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:50.200
and like, you know, Boohoo,
like what, what of the

582
00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:52.720
five great job offers do
I choose from? It's so

583
00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:55.540
hard. And I know that
can be frustrating and annoying

584
00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:57.730
to hear, but the truth
is like a lot of

585
00:29:57.730 --> 00:30:00.970
us have that luxury, like,
you know, and I think

586
00:30:00.970 --> 00:30:06.460
it's really your responsibility to
exercise your privilege and, you

587
00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:09.430
know, make those decisions like
it's, I mean, no one,

588
00:30:09.670 --> 00:30:11.500
like everything that you choose,
you're the only one that

589
00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:14.000
has to live with it.
So you better choose wisely.

590
00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:18.370
Right. And I think that's,
yeah. I mean, most of

591
00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:21.670
us have a ability to
AA choose between employers, but

592
00:30:21.670 --> 00:30:23.710
also just be able to
choose doing something you love.

593
00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:26.950
Right. And this is, you
know, a generation generational question.

594
00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:29.920
Like my parents, I will
actually, my parents were still

595
00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:32.170
were following their hearts and
did what they wanted, but

596
00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:35.830
I think there's definitely something
there's a, there's a gap.

597
00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:38.260
And nowadays there's a lot
of people who do have

598
00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:40.600
the ability to do what
they love and they have

599
00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:43.330
that option. It's not just,
you know, making sure that

600
00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:47.050
you put, you know, pay
the rent and then make

601
00:30:47.050 --> 00:30:48.970
sure your kids get booed.
And then that's it. Like,

602
00:30:48.970 --> 00:30:51.910
you really do have lots
of choices for how you

603
00:30:51.910 --> 00:30:54.460
get that money. And so
I think it's important to

604
00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:56.880
be choosing, Hopefully for folks,
you know, like you say,

605
00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:59.250
we have, we all have
various privileges of varying levels,

606
00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:00.810
but hopefully people will be
able to take some of

607
00:31:00.810 --> 00:31:04.080
the culture queries, the interview
questions and the resources that

608
00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:06.930
you put together, a key
values to enable them to

609
00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:08.970
ask the right questions and
hopefully get that, that next

610
00:31:08.970 --> 00:31:10.860
big job. And I appreciate
you coming on the show

611
00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:13.950
today. Yeah, no, it's so
great. Thank you for having

612
00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:16.920
me. This has been another
episode of Hansel minutes and

613
00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:18.210
we'll see you again next
week.
