From Hansel minutes.com. It's Hansel
minutes. Oh, weekly discussion with

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.710
web developer and technologists. Scott
Hanselman. This is Lawrence Ryan announcing

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.780
with Joseph Hill and Scott bellwether.
Hi, this is Scott Hanselman

8
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.180
and this is another episode
of Hansel minutes. This is

9
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.310
a mano, a episode of
Hansel minutes, and I've got

10
00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.060
two interesting people on today.
We've got Joseph Hill product manager

11
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.630
for mono. Thanks for coming
on Joseph. And we've got

12
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.870
the legendary Scott bellwether, a
internationally known.net and Ruby dandy.

13
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.640
And <inaudible> how are you?
Scott malware. I'm very good.

14
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.570
Thanks guys. Thanks for helping
me organize this, Scott. I

15
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.270
really appreciate it. You had
a, you've got a conference

16
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.750
coming up, focusing on, on
mano called mano space. Where

17
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.850
can people learn about that
other than on the, the

18
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:31.820
search engines? Well, the website
is monospace.us and we have

19
00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.540
a Twitter feed and a
blog feed as well, where

20
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.300
we're, where we're slowly leaking
from news is as things

21
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.990
go on, I guess most
people are talking about monospace

22
00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.260
on the social networks. So
that would probably be the

23
00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.590
best place to sort of
keep a, keep an ear

24
00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.780
to the ground. And when
is the conference Conferences? October 27th,

25
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.320
which is a Tuesday, October 30th,
Friday, which is the day

26
00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.580
before Halloween. Okay. And is
the conference focused entirely on,

27
00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.840
on mano? The significant focus?
I would say the majority

28
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.050
of the focus is mano,
but this is really a

29
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.050
conference parts. The first part
is two days of, of

30
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.160
in-depth tutorials or immersive tutorials.
And the second two days

31
00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.090
are an open space format
or an open format, much

32
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.200
like the way we did
Kaizen con in Austin last

33
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.410
year. And I think the
Seattle AlterNet conference did a

34
00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.650
little bit of the same
thing last spring as well.

35
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.430
The idea is to spend
two days learning new things,

36
00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.130
really sort of going deep
on things that you haven't

37
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.890
had a chance to get
exposure to before. And the

38
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.670
following two days, you can
spend time sort of honing

39
00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.580
that understanding or drilling that
understanding in by using the

40
00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.680
open space format to do
that. But the open space

41
00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.020
format also allows for anything.
So I expect the, the

42
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.130
participants who put any subject
they want into the, into

43
00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.440
the schedule and that can
most definitely leave the, the,

44
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.850
the subject area of mono.
So I expect that we'll

45
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.980
talk about open source on.net
broadly inclusive of mano and

46
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.610
inclusive, inclusive of MSPL, but
we also have some MSPL

47
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.920
content in the tutorial track
as well. I know that

48
00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.110
Glen block more than likely
or possibly, I'm not sure

49
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.030
what the likelihood is at
this point. He's working it

50
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.080
out, we'd come and do
a talk on the managed

51
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.930
extensibility framework. And I think
he might actually even do

52
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.770
that on, on a Linux
distro to show the mano

53
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.280
guys, some of the developments
that are going on from

54
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.570
the Microsoft side in open
source and MSPL that can

55
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.890
benefit and have an effect
on model development. So I'm

56
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.550
hoping that this really this
conference, like the conferences of

57
00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.370
the previous two years are
going to be an opportunity

58
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.210
to both learn, learn new
things and to cross pollinate

59
00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:01.030
ideas and make a, you
know, both broader and deeper

60
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.930
knowledge for the betterment of,
of our understanding of software

61
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.500
development and app development and.net
and CLR and mano by

62
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.550
convention. So for people who
aren't familiar and for maybe

63
00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.850
for our non native English
speaking listeners, when you're saying

64
00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.210
the word you're saying MSPL
is M S P L

65
00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:22.650
Microsoft permissive license, which is
Microsoft a very simple and

66
00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.950
fairly liberal open source license.
So when we say MSPL,

67
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.340
we're talking about open source
software from Microsoft, right? So

68
00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.530
you're focusing on mano at
the conference, but also on

69
00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.700
your anticipating some MSPs and
Microsoft open source topics as

70
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.930
well. Like you said, meth,
the, the managed extensibility framework,

71
00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.240
It's a little bit of
a digression into jargon when

72
00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.270
I said MSPL, I, I
guess I was referring to

73
00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.410
some of the open source
development, some of the open

74
00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.270
source frameworks on the, on
the development side and the

75
00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.890
dev stack that are built
by Microsoft. So Microsoft extensibility

76
00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:00.690
framework is an MSPL or
yeah, my MSPL product and

77
00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:06.720
AFP MVC is MSPL as
well. It's a, a, a,

78
00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:11.010
a, an official open source
license as per the, the,

79
00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.640
what does that body, the
OSI OSI, Yeah. Open source

80
00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:16.890
is that OSI open source
initiative. It's the people that

81
00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.610
recognize whether something's really open
source a Joseph. Yeah, that's

82
00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.230
right. Let me take it
this direction though. Why would

83
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:26.460
I care about mono Joseph?
I I'm a dotnet programmer

84
00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.860
and I do all my
work in the Microsoft CLR.

85
00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.650
Why would I want to,
to go to this conference

86
00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.420
and why would I want
to start using mono other

87
00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:36.270
than to try something different
as Scott said, Oh, that's

88
00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:41.190
that opens a whole can
of worms. So the short

89
00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:44.610
version and traditionally is that
we have these dotnet skills

90
00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:49.020
and you don't want them
to be tied exclusively to

91
00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:53.400
Microsoft platforms. So that's one
common, common answer. And I

92
00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.060
think we can probably delve
into that pretty deeply. And

93
00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:59.540
you know, some of the
other answers on the cider

94
00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.960
that we do a lot
of.net development off of windows.

95
00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:05.870
And a lot of that
in can be extremely relevant

96
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:08.960
to.net developers. So we've developed
a lot of libraries that

97
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.980
are fully managed that developers
can take advantage of in

98
00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:16.340
windows. And some of those
are being adopted like the

99
00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:20.090
mano dot addins framework we
have, which some overlap with

100
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:23.870
math that Delaware was mentioning
earlier, but provides some, some

101
00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:28.130
separate functionality as well. We
have, we have our motto

102
00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:32.480
develop IDE, which is visual
studio, like visual studio developers

103
00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.550
would be very comfortable in
it, but it actually runs

104
00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:39.920
very well on Linux windows
and Mac. And, you know,

105
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.650
really it's a, you know,
like, like Scott said, it's

106
00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:46.610
a broadening of knowledge. There's,
there's a lot to be

107
00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:49.870
learned from the, from the
cross pollination there, Wouldn't you

108
00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:52.930
say that kind of historically,
and historically of course in

109
00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:55.540
the, in the internet is
maybe the last few months

110
00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:58.510
or the last year or
two, but historically that mano

111
00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:01.990
development hasn't exactly been easy
for the person who lives

112
00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:04.300
inside of visual studio for
the, for the windows visual

113
00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:06.730
studio person that they're gonna
spend a little more time

114
00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:08.230
at the command line, or
a little more time in

115
00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:11.950
an IDE that maybe isn't
visual studio. This is extremely

116
00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:13.540
true. Yeah. This is, I
don't know. It's not exactly

117
00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:15.490
a slam dunk is what
I'm saying. And it's very

118
00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:17.990
exciting and powerful, but from
a tooling perspective, it's not

119
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:21.760
a, it's not incredibly easy.
Like you said, historical and

120
00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:24.700
internet terms. I mean, when,
when I got into it,

121
00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:28.510
which was, you know, 2003,
it was okay, first download

122
00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:31.150
the model sources. And it's
been a few days figuring

123
00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.490
out how to build that
and bootstrap up from there.

124
00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:36.280
And, you know, in the,
in the past year or

125
00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:39.130
two, we've, we've gotten a
lot closer to, I mean,

126
00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:40.720
at least if you go
to the mano website, you

127
00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:44.530
can get a virtual machine
or live CD that, that

128
00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:47.920
has everything pre-configured. So that
in the simplest case, particularly

129
00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:52.390
like if you take an
asp.net website, you could publish

130
00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:55.690
your asp.net website to a
Linux server from directly within

131
00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:59.380
visual studio as is. So
the story has gotten a

132
00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:02.230
lot better, but yeah, I
mean, there's always, there's always

133
00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:04.990
a level of comfort that
people, you know, have to

134
00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:07.870
figure out if they're willing
to come up to now

135
00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:10.510
that said, I think it's
a good segue into, you

136
00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:14.140
know, part of what we've
been focused on doing within

137
00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:16.960
the mano team in the
past year, which is to

138
00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:20.170
really improve the story for
the visual studio developers. And,

139
00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:22.450
you know, we have some
tools for visual studio that,

140
00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:28.480
that are currently in preview
form and will be, you

141
00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:29.890
know, we're opening it up
more and more, we'll be

142
00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:33.250
launching it actually very soon.
Cause they're, they're, they're starting

143
00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:36.090
to become quite complete, but
what we've done there is

144
00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:39.670
created in that, in for
visual studio that tries to

145
00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:42.820
remove that, that last layer
of complexity that you were

146
00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:46.330
referred to so that, you
know, really it is truly

147
00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:49.810
as simple as, okay, build
this, run it in motto,

148
00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.880
you know, run it remotely
on a Linux server and

149
00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:56.640
mano, and ultimately be able
to remotely from within visual

150
00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.940
studio directly to, to Amano
application running on a, on

151
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:03.040
a Linux box. And this
is what we're calling colloquium,

152
00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:05.330
mano vs. Is that kind
of the, the code name

153
00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:07.670
we'll call it for now.
Yeah. That's a, you know,

154
00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:09.590
mono vs. If you wanted
to see about it on

155
00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:11.660
Twitter, you'd be looking for
the, you know, hash mono

156
00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:15.530
vs. Hashtag. Okay. So that's,
that's the short form. There

157
00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:17.960
are some, there's still some
debate on the final name,

158
00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:20.810
but it's, you know, MonaVie
S is growing on me.

159
00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:24.230
So it could just be
that, And this plugs into

160
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:26.750
visual studio as a native
add in as a windows

161
00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:29.120
ad and it's custom to
visual studio. And is it,

162
00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:31.490
is it, is it an
add in that's? What is

163
00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:32.990
it doing? Is it shelling
out? I mean, how does

164
00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:37.160
this thing making mano feel
as convenient as doing regular.net

165
00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.940
development? So it is a,
it's a, it's a normal

166
00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:44.210
add in if you've ever
installed an ad in individual

167
00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:47.330
studio, you're probably familiar with
the term. I mean, it's,

168
00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:49.400
you know, you say something's
an ad and it has,

169
00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:52.970
it has a specific connotation.
And that's what this is.

170
00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:56.330
And in fact, you know,
Novell joined the, the visual

171
00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:59.780
studio industry partners program so
that we could really get

172
00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:03.740
hooked into the visual studio
ecosystem. As a, as I've

173
00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:07.850
heard it referenced a few
places, you know, what it

174
00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:10.850
comes down to is, is
making visual studio developers as

175
00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:13.550
comfortable as they can be
in, in their, in their

176
00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:17.840
native environment because visual studio
is an integrated development environment

177
00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:23.390
and, and developers expect an
integrated development experience. And so

178
00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:25.130
that is what it tries
to provide. We, we had

179
00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:28.340
the, we had the menus
to the, the menu bar

180
00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:33.740
and context menus where they
make sense and it tries

181
00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:35.210
to achieve a couple of
goals. I mean, we, we

182
00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:38.480
want to expose the features.
The developers believe they need

183
00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:42.650
directly within visual studio. But
beyond that, we were trying

184
00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:47.210
to hide developers through the
process of getting an application

185
00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:50.510
running on mono. So each
of the features are, are,

186
00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:52.880
you know, you can get
to them where they make

187
00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:57.380
sense, but beyond that, we
we've arranged everything so that

188
00:10:58.070 --> 00:10:59.960
if you didn't know where
to get started before, you'll,

189
00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:03.110
you'll know exactly where to
jump in now. So there's

190
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:06.260
a list of features and
it starts with the motto

191
00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.530
migration analyzer, which, you know,
prior to prior to the

192
00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:11.930
digital studio tools is, has
been a tool that we

193
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:14.720
host on the website. That's
just a standalone WinForms app

194
00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:19.070
today, but we've integrated, integrated
that in visual studio so

195
00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:22.490
that what you can do
is you can say analyze

196
00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:26.870
my, my application that I'm
developing here, and it will

197
00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:30.500
compare everything you're calling in.net
to everything that's available in

198
00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:34.190
mano and, and give you
warnings just like you would

199
00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:36.500
expect, you know, other warnings
to show up in visual

200
00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:38.630
studio where you can double
click and say, go to

201
00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:41.480
this call. And if you're
calling a method that doesn't

202
00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:44.270
exist in mano yet, then
you'll be able to correct

203
00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:49.340
it right there. Or if
you're dependent on, you know,

204
00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:53.150
native libraries and you're doing
team folks, you'll get warnings

205
00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.720
say, Hey, you need to
be aware of this. This

206
00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:59.290
method may not exist under
target platform, so you can

207
00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:01.380
address it. How, how often
does that happen? I mean,

208
00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:02.910
I think that's a real
question that people want to

209
00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:05.460
understand about mano is that,
so you just use the

210
00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:07.590
term P invoke, right. And
this means calling into a

211
00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:10.950
native library. So for example,
I can't call, I can't

212
00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:14.730
be on Linux running a
dotnet application under mono, and

213
00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:16.920
then say, I want to
call into, you know, something

214
00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:19.290
in kernel 30, two dot
DLL, you know, I can't

215
00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:22.770
touch the operating system. And
that's, that's what a virtual

216
00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:25.470
machine is for. But I
think what people, people wonder

217
00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:27.600
if they're thinking about going
to mano they're, I think

218
00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:30.240
they're afraid that they might
start moving in there and

219
00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:32.910
then discover that there's some
whole section or some whole

220
00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:35.610
API that they just don't
have. They don't have access

221
00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:37.740
to it. It doesn't even
exist. What's the surface area

222
00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:40.050
like. Yeah. Well, so that's
the great thing about MoMA.

223
00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:42.960
I mean, the mono migration
analyzer is, is you can

224
00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:45.390
take that and point at
a compile happen and quickly

225
00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:48.150
start to, to answer those
questions and begin breaking down

226
00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:54.060
the problem. So first to
speak to surface area, aside

227
00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:55.890
from Colonel 32, we'll get
into that in a moment.

228
00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:58.800
But you know, the first
question is really whether or

229
00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:01.230
not the method that you're
calling, even if it's a.net

230
00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:03.690
method, does it exist in
mano? I mean, clearly we,

231
00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:06.480
we lag because we follow
the implementation as they're released.

232
00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.940
We, we don't generally try
to get too far out

233
00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:12.990
ahead of the curve. So
we're missing things like, you

234
00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:16.500
know, big parts of the.net
API. So you're not going

235
00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:23.040
to have WCF or a
workflow or WPF. And, you

236
00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:25.740
know, in.net three, five, we
were just wrapping up our

237
00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:29.940
link to SQL implementation beyond
that the surface area doesn't

238
00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:31.770
look so bad. We actually
have a pretty complete story.

239
00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:34.470
If you're, you're doing asp.net
or SP that, and that

240
00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:38.760
story's been complete for quite
awhile and asp.net Ajax is

241
00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:43.110
ran quite well. Thank you
for that being MSPL the

242
00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:46.440
same story with ASP net,
NBC. We, we supported that

243
00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:49.200
on the day it was
released Really. So he didn't,

244
00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.430
it just took a couple
of hours for you to

245
00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:52.980
get MVC to work online.
Oh, well, so actually what

246
00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:55.320
happened is, you know, for
a while we didn't know

247
00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:57.030
what the license was. We
just sort of stayed away

248
00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:59.040
from it. And then as
it got close to the

249
00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:03.120
final release, the, the binaries
removed there had previously been

250
00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:05.460
a restriction in the license
that said you can't run

251
00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:09.720
these, these binaries off of
windows. And when that license

252
00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:14.070
restriction was removed, we in
the lead up to the

253
00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:18.420
final MVC release, we started
testing against the binaries. And

254
00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:20.370
then, you know, luckily when
the final release happened and

255
00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:22.980
it was MSPL, we were
ready to hit the ground

256
00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:26.220
running. Cool. Now you, Scott,
how much time have you

257
00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:28.260
spent with Manuel personally? Cause
when you're hosting them on

258
00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.960
a space conference on open
space conference based on mono,

259
00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:32.610
but how much time have
you spent with it? Have

260
00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:37.430
you been using the Mo
the MoMA, analyzer and Monrovia

261
00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:51.590
at all? I haven't been
using, I'm not really been

262
00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:58.850
Too terribly. What's the word?
It's an X word, not

263
00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:03.230
extend us, but I haven't
done a whole heck of

264
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:06.470
a lot with it yet.
I have monitor develop online

265
00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:09.530
on my Mac book and
I've been working with it,

266
00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:12.920
working on a website, built
on mono or helping a

267
00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:15.530
friend with a website we've
done one mono. And, you

268
00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:20.660
know, it's, it's, it's just
like working pretty much from

269
00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:23.210
my perspective as a developer
or the experience is pretty

270
00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:27.170
much just like everything else
I've done in.net buildings, web

271
00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:31.160
forms, applications. So I don't
really sure that there's a

272
00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:34.970
whole lot to say about
it beyond, you know, dot

273
00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:39.680
net development, the reason I'm
hosting mono space, you know,

274
00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:43.190
the reason why, you know,
I hosted the, the Y

275
00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:46.880
hosted conferences for the last
two years, and this will

276
00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:49.820
be the third year in
Austin. That for me, it's

277
00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:54.230
a really great way to
concoct a circumstance where I

278
00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:58.070
can be around people that
have things that I want

279
00:15:58.070 --> 00:16:01.640
to learn. So Mona was
more for me, something that

280
00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:04.880
I really understand the more,
I really want to understand

281
00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:11.480
more of the possibilities running.net
on platforms that are not

282
00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:15.680
only windows, one of those,
you know, it's a great

283
00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:21.830
example with the iPhone. So
I'm hosting the conference, not

284
00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:24.530
because I'm an expert, but
because I want to be,

285
00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:27.730
I want to have some
time with some experts. Oh,

286
00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:29.860
that's an interesting idea. So
I think this brings up

287
00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:31.630
an interesting point as well,
and I'd be interested in

288
00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:33.010
what both of you have
to think about this. So

289
00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:36.280
people might say, people might
be listening to this and

290
00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:38.670
they might say, wow, Scott,
just ask other Scott or

291
00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:41.200
now other Scott, by the
way, Hanson, let's just ask

292
00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:45.100
bellwether, tell me about your
expertise in, in mano. And,

293
00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.350
and here you are saying,
well, you know, I'm not

294
00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:49.750
much of an expert I'm
organizing this conference because I

295
00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:53.260
want to talk to experts.
I think that's a really

296
00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:56.590
interesting and interesting way to
talk about community because so

297
00:16:56.590 --> 00:16:59.950
often we have this sense
of, and I mentioned this

298
00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:03.520
before on a, on a
webcast that authorship equals authority.

299
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.720
And here you are a
proclaimed, not expert in mano,

300
00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:10.540
but you have put together
a motto conference, and this

301
00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:13.780
is kind of the new
generation of, of, of community.

302
00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:16.390
Isn't it that you know,
why, why should you have

303
00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:17.560
to be an expert? If
you're going to have an

304
00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:19.660
open spaces conference, you want
to bring people in this,

305
00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:22.540
isn't attempting where this isn't
a conference where bellwether talks

306
00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:25.060
to us about mono, right?
You're you're in this case,

307
00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:28.840
the catalyst, I am not,
I'm not teaching at this

308
00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:31.930
conference. I'm not presenting at
this conference. I'll certainly do

309
00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:34.480
certainly share any, any knowledge
that I have with people

310
00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:38.020
with the open space, if
they want it, and if

311
00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:43.030
it's appropriate, but this is
a conference from, from, I

312
00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:46.360
mean, this is really selfish
from my perspective. I like

313
00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:50.070
to spend some time sitting
at the seat of, and

314
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:53.250
being a student and learning
something that's just is way

315
00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:56.880
outside of my current knowledge
set. And this is just

316
00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.200
a way to do that.
And I think a lot

317
00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:03.690
of people organizing regional conferences
in.net probably get the same,

318
00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:06.090
the same kick out of
it. I can't imagine that

319
00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:10.020
the guys organizing, you know,
the conference, I can't remember

320
00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:14.040
the name of it. The
conference in Tennessee, that's becoming

321
00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:17.430
quite popular. And the one
up in, in the great

322
00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:19.260
Plains one, and that's the
great Plains to the great

323
00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:21.270
lakes one. I mean, I'm
pretty sure those guys have

324
00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:25.980
the same mentality where it's
just a great chance to

325
00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:29.850
provide a space where you
can be near the people

326
00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:34.580
who you want to be
your teachers. Yeah, definitely When

327
00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:36.950
we shaped Cottonwood, you know,
because that's my goal. When

328
00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:42.680
I shaped conferences like this,
I'm specifically creating a conference

329
00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:46.040
that's structured for teaching and
learning and interaction with experts

330
00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:50.120
rather than a conference that's
geared at a commercial more

331
00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:55.160
commercial imperative. We don't really
have, obviously this will promote

332
00:18:56.300 --> 00:19:00.410
mono and it'll promote some
of the Microsoft MSPL products

333
00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:03.500
and he'll promote open source.
And the code flex guys

334
00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:05.270
are coming down to talk
and engage the community, go

335
00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:07.790
to open source. But really
this is about getting an

336
00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:09.950
opportunity to be in a,
in a, in a conference

337
00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:13.400
style that is completely built
from the ground up in

338
00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:17.810
its DNA to be about
learning and teaching. Hey, everybody,

339
00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:19.670
this is Scott coming at
you from another place in

340
00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:22.940
time. No doubt. You probably
bump into testing tasks now,

341
00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:25.610
and then, and your work
and, you know, writing functional

342
00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:27.530
tests is probably not your
favorite thing. It's kind of

343
00:19:27.530 --> 00:19:29.900
difficult. It takes time and
the results can be dubious.

344
00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:33.200
Well, get ready to start
liking tests. Thanks to Tellerik

345
00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:37.280
with the, the new whereby
testing framework building web automation

346
00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:40.550
test is a breeze. You've
got code automation with advanced

347
00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:43.100
asp.net, Ajax and server light
applications. You can write a

348
00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:46.640
single test, have it executed
against multiple browsers at once.

349
00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:50.390
You'd benefit from a rich
API there's link support integration

350
00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:53.510
with visual studio unit testing,
also in unit X unit

351
00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:56.660
and NBA unit, not to
mention the free rappers for

352
00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:59.510
Telerik rad controls for ESPN
and Ajax, and several light,

353
00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:03.260
all shipping with Telerik's new
testing tool. One of the

354
00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:06.470
best features, the webinar testing
framework, which is developed by

355
00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:10.700
art of test is it's
absolutely free. Freddie got hooked

356
00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:13.580
on web testing framework, start
using it right away, go

357
00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:18.650
to tellerik.com for more info.
Thanks a lot. Joseph, the,

358
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:21.740
the, the, the code Plex
foundation has started up here

359
00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:25.460
and you guys are involved
or Miguel's involved at least

360
00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:31.190
there's this relationship between Microsoft
and mano that I think

361
00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:33.020
is great. And as a,
I mean, of course, but

362
00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:35.300
I worked for Microsoft. So
you can't trust me where

363
00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:39.350
they didn't say anything. I
suppose it seems like Novell

364
00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:41.930
is and motto of getting
a lot of hassle from

365
00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:44.510
the open source guys lately
you see on Miguel's blog,

366
00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:47.830
he's getting a lot of
people just not being pleasant

367
00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:53.020
about, about the relationship that
you guys have with Microsoft.

368
00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:55.630
I, as a Microsoft guy
inside, I feel like we're

369
00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:57.520
really trying to change things
and include a lot more

370
00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:00.340
open source. What we're doing.
We're kind of, we're pushing

371
00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:04.540
it every chance we can
to, to opensource things. What

372
00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:06.460
does it feel like from
the other side of the,

373
00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:11.100
of the evil partnership on
the Novell side? Well, you

374
00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:14.400
know, from our perspective, I
really believe in what, what

375
00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:18.570
Miguel says, which is, you
know, he's going to focus

376
00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:22.650
on the possibilities. There's, you
know, it's, it's too much

377
00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:26.130
of open sources and us
versus them mentality. And I

378
00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:30.540
think the actions that Miguel
has consistently taken have been

379
00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:34.830
where I can make people
more open and Microsoft in

380
00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:39.720
particular that benefits everybody. And
that's, that's much better for

381
00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:44.940
the community and users and
developers than, than trying to

382
00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:47.460
draw a line in the
sand. So, you know, what's

383
00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:50.700
interesting is, is Miguel has
taken a lot of flack

384
00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:52.710
and I'm sure it's probably
taken its toll on him.

385
00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:55.740
You know, there's a lot
of personal attacks, Right? Well,

386
00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:57.210
people are saying, he's not
really a member of the

387
00:21:57.210 --> 00:21:59.340
open source community cause he's
in bed with Microsoft. Yeah.

388
00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:01.620
Certainly some people are, but
you know, what, what really

389
00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:03.960
surprised me as I went
through and looked at, I

390
00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:07.470
mean, he had a recent
blog posts that, you know,

391
00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:13.980
sort of held out the,
the Palm, you know, for,

392
00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:17.550
for peace there, a peace
offering, if you will. And

393
00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:20.820
you know, the, the, there
was some, you know, there

394
00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:22.890
were very limited attacks actually.
I think coming back at

395
00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:25.440
him versus, you know, a
lot of people that said,

396
00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:27.540
wow, I really, I really
get what you're doing. And,

397
00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:32.070
and I think it's great
that, that Microsoft clearly becoming

398
00:22:32.610 --> 00:22:35.610
more open. And I think
Miguel deserves a lot of

399
00:22:35.610 --> 00:22:39.540
credit for it. So from
our perspective, and of course,

400
00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:41.790
particularly with my background, I
mean, I was a.net developer

401
00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:45.060
for, I joined Nobel. I
I've always believed that this

402
00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:48.450
potential life there and, you
know, there's potential and Microsoft

403
00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:51.060
is a great, great software
company and there's potential and,

404
00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:56.760
and, you know, the.net framework
being available to all developers.

405
00:22:57.180 --> 00:23:01.230
And, you know, this is,
this is definitely furthering, you

406
00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:05.910
know, some good goals. Do
you think that this is

407
00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:09.750
competition? I mean, is model
just flat out competition or

408
00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:13.650
is it filling? Go ahead.
Yeah. I mean, I'm sure

409
00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:18.540
I I'm sure there's, there's,
it's it's yeah. I mean,

410
00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:21.000
clearly there's a lot of
competition. We would, we would,

411
00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:25.110
we would love to, you
know, to, to win over

412
00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:28.890
some dotnet developers, but, you
know, it's, I guess it's

413
00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:32.340
about finding where, you know,
we have mutual mutual interests

414
00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:36.360
and, you know, growing the
pie, as they say, there's

415
00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:40.170
a, you know, when we
make the platform better, we

416
00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:45.650
both. And do you think
that's the case? Scott personally,

417
00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:49.160
I've Always been, you know,
aggravated I think a little

418
00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:54.110
bit by a number of,
of folks in Microsoft, certainly

419
00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:59.810
not everybody who sort of
subconsciously or pre consciously feel

420
00:23:59.810 --> 00:24:03.380
that the word competition is
necessarily a negative. And I

421
00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:06.980
did as very much a
neutral force. It can either

422
00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:10.550
be, they can either lead
to, you know, bad outcomes

423
00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:13.580
or good outcomes. And, and
I tend to see competition

424
00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:19.070
naturally as something that's really
great because it gets people,

425
00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:23.210
it blows up the dust
out of a pipe, it

426
00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:25.850
gets the letter G out
of the way. It gets

427
00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:29.360
people thinking and it gets
companies innovating and it gets

428
00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:33.710
productivity improved. And, and, and
it has, it makes our,

429
00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:35.690
you know, it makes us
call it the question are

430
00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:38.450
our firmest beliefs and come
up with the next generation

431
00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:41.840
of beliefs. So, yeah, I
think it's absolutely competitive, but

432
00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:44.380
I am one of, I,
I, my definition of, or

433
00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:48.740
of, of competition is, is
a hundred percent positive. I

434
00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:51.740
mean, it's just kind of
like saying, yeah, it increases

435
00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:55.940
profit or it increases opportunity.
It's productivity and competition go

436
00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:57.850
hand in hand. So it's
just a given it's just,

437
00:24:57.850 --> 00:25:00.220
of course. So clearly in
your mind though, the world

438
00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:03.190
would be a lesser place
without, without the mano option,

439
00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:07.270
A lesser place without diversity
of any conflict. Well, you

440
00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:08.410
should put that on a
tee shirt. It's got, that

441
00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:12.130
was beautiful. Did you just
come up with that? No,

442
00:25:12.130 --> 00:25:14.530
but you know, I'm, You
said a little bit here,

443
00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:17.410
just a tear just right
down my face. I'm a

444
00:25:17.410 --> 00:25:20.440
firm believer in the value
of diversity and I, and

445
00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:23.710
I believe in diversity because
every time I come face

446
00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:27.430
to face with diversity in
my life, it it's, it's,

447
00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:30.190
it's very challenging and it's
often painful. And I know

448
00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:32.080
when I come, you know,
face to face with those

449
00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:35.050
experiences, that, you know, that
experience is showing me at

450
00:25:35.050 --> 00:25:36.790
a place in my life
where it's time to stretch

451
00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:39.820
out and grow. And, and,
and that's part of what

452
00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:43.000
competition does. It does increase
the diversity and through diversity,

453
00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:48.580
we both broaden and deeper
our ability, Well, speaking of

454
00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:52.450
competition, and, and as, as
if it wasn't confusing enough

455
00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:55.210
for the average Joe out
there, really, if you're coding

456
00:25:55.210 --> 00:25:58.210
C-sharp or VB, you're in
a good, you're in a

457
00:25:58.210 --> 00:26:01.180
good position right now, cause
you can create a whole

458
00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:05.200
diverse series of applications. Joseph,
can you talk a little

459
00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:07.810
bit about, about mano touch
and what that means to

460
00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:11.590
the average windows C-sharp and
VB developer out there? Oh,

461
00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:13.420
of course. I'd love to
talk about mono touch. This

462
00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:19.480
has been really dominating a
lot of my life for,

463
00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:22.480
for the past several months
and then particularly, you know,

464
00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:24.610
in the past two weeks
since we launched them on

465
00:26:24.610 --> 00:26:28.360
no touch product. So, so
mono touch is, you know,

466
00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:30.010
for those who don't know,
it's a model for the

467
00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:36.100
iPhone and, you know, that's,
I think, you know, I

468
00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:38.020
hate to use a cliche,
but I mean, it's sort

469
00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:42.370
of game changing, you know,
there's iPhone itself being referenced

470
00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:48.540
is that quite the iPhone
development platform prior to mano

471
00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:56.220
touch was essentially X code
and objective C and yeah,

472
00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:58.500
with mano touch, what we
did is we've, we've opened

473
00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:03.240
up the platform to the.net
developers. And of course this

474
00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:07.260
is attractive to people who
are really attached to C-sharp

475
00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:11.550
and you know, they want
to use those skills to

476
00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:14.610
develop iPhone apps, but it's
even been very attractive to

477
00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:17.580
do people who've already bit
the bullet and learn objective

478
00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:23.370
C just because, you know,
C sharp and motto offer

479
00:27:23.370 --> 00:27:26.550
some advantages, you know, over
the, over the current tool

480
00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:30.530
set that's available. So apparently
it's, it's reasonably easy to

481
00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:33.380
make an iPhone application, even
though you're using objective C

482
00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:35.750
because there's a whole, I
mean, there's an app for

483
00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:37.860
that, whatever there is, there's
an app for that. What,

484
00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:40.880
what is the benefit of,
of, of me writing the

485
00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:45.050
application and a d.net.net platform?
Well, there's a few, I

486
00:27:45.050 --> 00:27:48.710
mean, one is the, I
mean, of course it's a.net

487
00:27:49.910 --> 00:27:54.080
is, is comfortable for many
people. But I mean, like

488
00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:55.750
I said, if you, if
you already have bit the

489
00:27:55.790 --> 00:27:59.360
objective C bullet it's, it's
really, are you comfortable with,

490
00:27:59.650 --> 00:28:01.970
with the syntax and, you
know, we, we bring, we

491
00:28:01.970 --> 00:28:05.150
bring C-sharp three to the
iPhone. So, you know, when

492
00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:06.680
I say the syntax, I
mean, you know, you get

493
00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:14.840
link, we have linked XML,
you know, several examples published

494
00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:19.880
on the site already and
you know, everything else below

495
00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:21.710
that, that, that depends on.
So, you know, you get

496
00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:26.120
your Lambdas and your generics,
et cetera. We also have

497
00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:28.640
garbage collection. You don't have
that in objective C on

498
00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:31.910
the iPhone. Wow. And now
I understand though, that there's

499
00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:34.040
not, you don't have the
ability to do what we

500
00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:37.100
call jitting just-in-time compilation on
an iPhone. That's something that

501
00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:40.280
is, it's not that it's
technically impossible, but it's explicitly

502
00:28:40.550 --> 00:28:43.850
called out that you can't
do kind of co-generation and

503
00:28:43.850 --> 00:28:47.750
just-in-time interpretation on an iPhone.
So how did you get

504
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:51.020
around that since, since dotnet
bytecode works the way that

505
00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:53.450
it does. Right? So it's,
I mean, it's, it is

506
00:28:53.450 --> 00:28:56.030
a license restriction. It's also
a technical restriction. The Colonel

507
00:28:56.030 --> 00:29:01.250
enforces this. Yeah. So, I
mean, I guess what it

508
00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:03.710
comes down to is that,
you know, you can generate

509
00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:05.960
code, but you can't execute
it cause you can't change.

510
00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:10.130
You know, you're not allowed
to change the, the memory

511
00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:13.040
that you write to, to
be executable. So this limits

512
00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:15.950
a lot of languages and
virtual machines from, from being

513
00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:20.720
able to be, you know,
put on the iPhone, the

514
00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:23.990
way we get around it
is mano has a feature

515
00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:28.190
which is full ahead of
time compilation. This would be

516
00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:32.090
similar to engine in dotnet
except engine isn't, isn't really

517
00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:34.430
full ahead of time compilation.
But in the case of

518
00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:38.000
mono, we can actually take
a dotnet executable and piled

519
00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.550
the whole thing down to
a native executable. And so

520
00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:44.650
that just means that, you
know, basically every path that

521
00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:47.770
could be jetted, we didn't
advance none. There's a couple

522
00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:51.220
of a couple of features
that means you're not gonna

523
00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:55.300
have access to such as
reflection of mint clearly or

524
00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:57.610
anything that depends on that,
but you still get a

525
00:29:57.610 --> 00:30:00.730
pretty, pretty, a complete set
of dotnet functionality without that.

526
00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:03.360
So what underlying library are
you talking to? I mean,

527
00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:05.400
this isn't wind farms, right?
I mean, that would be,

528
00:30:05.610 --> 00:30:11.520
that would be weird. It's
cocoa. And so let me

529
00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:13.080
just tell you, I, maybe
I should just take a

530
00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:14.340
step back and talk a
little bit about what the

531
00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:16.620
development experience is actually like.
Yeah. Let's, let's do that

532
00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:18.540
because we understand that let's
just back up for a

533
00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:20.190
second, kind of like have
a reset in sense of

534
00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:25.110
the whole, the whole talk.
So mano itself is an

535
00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:29.700
open source implementation of the
CLI that allows you to

536
00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:31.830
take, we're going to write
C sharp and the code

537
00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:33.300
that you know, how to
write now in the libraries,

538
00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:35.130
you know how to write
now and it'll work on

539
00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:40.500
non windows systems. Mano vs
is the name we're using

540
00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:43.140
for the add in that
plugs into visual studio and

541
00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:45.690
makes it really easy for
you to do this in

542
00:30:45.690 --> 00:30:49.560
the environment you're comfortable with
monospace as the conference that

543
00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:52.560
Scott's holding in October. And
now we're talking about mano

544
00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:58.440
touch, which is the ability
to compile dotnet applications, targeting

545
00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:00.510
the iPhone. And then maybe
you can explain that we're

546
00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:03.630
not necessarily doing this in
visual studio, right? Interjection here.

547
00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:08.350
We, you know, we're, we're
often talking about C-sharp because

548
00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:10.050
that's where we default, but
it, I think it's important

549
00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:13.350
to note too, that vb.net
is in play here as

550
00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:17.040
well. And from what I
understand, people have got iron

551
00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:22.440
Python and iron Ruby running
on, on the mono implementation

552
00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:24.750
of the, of the runtime
as well. Thank you for

553
00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:27.360
keeping me, keeping me honest.
You're absolutely right. But to

554
00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:29.850
take all that back into
the context of what I

555
00:31:29.850 --> 00:31:34.080
think you were asking with
mano touch is, well, Manuel

556
00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:36.660
touches an SDK and it
runs on a Mac. So

557
00:31:36.810 --> 00:31:41.760
that's probably the place to
start. So, you know, with,

558
00:31:41.930 --> 00:31:44.550
with mano touch, we've included
all the tools. And I

559
00:31:44.550 --> 00:31:47.940
mean, if you wanted to
do, you know, I phone

560
00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:52.230
development, you know, with, with
visual studio in the command

561
00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:56.220
line, you know, your, your
experience would be, you know,

562
00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:58.800
fire up visual studio, maybe
in parallels or whatever, and,

563
00:31:59.070 --> 00:32:01.590
and write you some C
sharp and then compile it

564
00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:04.070
and then switch over to
your Mac and, and, and

565
00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:07.470
use, you know, the tools
that we provide there. But

566
00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:10.590
that's really not the best
development experience. And it's not

567
00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:13.590
really what we, what we
designed the experience to be.

568
00:32:14.130 --> 00:32:16.980
So really what, what most
people are gonna see and

569
00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:21.090
experience when they work with,
with mano touches, firing up

570
00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:24.900
mano develop on the Mac.
And since Scott mentioned that

571
00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:27.300
I probably should interject that,
you know, model developed is

572
00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:30.210
really, it supports multiple languages,
but it really works best

573
00:32:30.210 --> 00:32:32.880
at C sharp. So I,
you know, while you can

574
00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:35.790
do VB, you know, if
you have, if, if you,

575
00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:38.190
you know, if you have
a real need to do

576
00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:40.880
that, your best story is
going to be C sharp.

577
00:32:41.410 --> 00:32:43.120
Okay. So you're saying C-sharp
is really kind of first

578
00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:47.080
among equals in a sense.
Yeah. Correct. So C sharp

579
00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:50.200
supported really well in mana
development and the visual studio

580
00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:54.670
developer opening up mano develop
would be very comfortable with,

581
00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:57.940
with the experience you're going
to, you know, you're going

582
00:32:57.940 --> 00:33:01.330
to have your IntelliSense and
project structure very similar to

583
00:33:01.330 --> 00:33:03.490
what you're used to. In
fact, mano developed supports the

584
00:33:03.490 --> 00:33:08.140
same solution in project file
format as visual studio. So

585
00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:10.600
you could even share code
in that manner. But the

586
00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:14.230
experience for, for the iPhone
development is that we actually

587
00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:18.100
integrate to Apple's X code,
where it makes sense because

588
00:33:18.130 --> 00:33:20.110
there's a lot of functionality
that we depend on there.

589
00:33:20.650 --> 00:33:24.310
I see. So you're not
trying to necessarily rewrite everything

590
00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:28.330
that already works. Correct. So,
so your question was, you

591
00:33:28.330 --> 00:33:30.280
know, what is the UI
and this isn't WinForms on

592
00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:34.240
an iPhone clearly, that would
be ugly. So what we

593
00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:37.390
actually do is we support
the, the interface builder that

594
00:33:37.810 --> 00:33:42.760
Apple ships with the iPhone
SDK and interface builder is,

595
00:33:43.150 --> 00:33:44.860
you know, as a designer,
you would, you would be

596
00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:48.040
comfortable with that experience. You
have a, you know, a

597
00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:51.010
toolbox and you trapped controls
onto a form that is

598
00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:54.280
at the aspect ratio of
an iPhone. So it looks,

599
00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:56.080
you know, it looks like
you're, you're designing on an

600
00:33:56.080 --> 00:34:00.970
iPhone screen. And at the
end of that process, you

601
00:34:00.970 --> 00:34:02.950
know, you have what you
want your UI to look

602
00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:07.180
like. And those are several
controls that, well, the way

603
00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:11.080
we access them in, in
mano developed is that you

604
00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:16.030
name outlets, which is the,
the term from there, you

605
00:34:16.030 --> 00:34:19.570
know, from, from their designer
world. But basically you would

606
00:34:19.570 --> 00:34:22.570
go through name outlets to
correspond to all of the

607
00:34:22.570 --> 00:34:26.090
controls that you want to
have access to. And then

608
00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:29.530
you save your, your designer
file and you go back

609
00:34:29.530 --> 00:34:33.100
to mono develop and it
will they'll wanna develop the

610
00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:37.150
text. You know, it detects
all the interfaces that you

611
00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:40.480
have created from within model
develop. It's kind of hard

612
00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:42.880
to describe, But it kind
of reminds me of model,

613
00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:45.790
view controller type of a
structure or what we used

614
00:34:45.790 --> 00:34:48.820
to call document view back
in the day. But the

615
00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:51.610
idea that you, you create
your resources in one place,

616
00:34:51.610 --> 00:34:54.340
you prepare all of your
user interface stuff, and then

617
00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:56.200
you go and you do
all of your logic and

618
00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:58.390
then you hook them up
to each other. Right? So,

619
00:34:59.470 --> 00:35:01.670
but I think the part
that I felt to described

620
00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:04.000
is that it's all still
very integrated in a monitor

621
00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.400
developed. So from within monitored,
obviously I want to add

622
00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:09.940
a new interface and it
adds the zip file for

623
00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:12.280
you. And then you double
click on that and you're

624
00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:14.590
going to be pretty comfortable
transitioning over to a designer

625
00:35:14.590 --> 00:35:17.500
that's running, you know, outside
of the model developer experience,

626
00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:19.570
but still in it. And
when you save your files,

627
00:35:19.570 --> 00:35:23.350
we automatically generate all of
the, you know, the partial

628
00:35:23.350 --> 00:35:27.010
classes like you would get
with any other designer, kind

629
00:35:27.010 --> 00:35:30.880
of a model, you know,
that we're all comfortable with

630
00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:35.620
from asp.net or WinForms designing.
So, you know, so back

631
00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:39.000
in mono develop, you now
have everything bound up nicely

632
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.700
for you. And all of
your controls exposed is.net controls.

633
00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:45.150
And, and you know, all
the properties exposed within there

634
00:35:45.690 --> 00:35:48.300
that you're going to have
access to change. And from

635
00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:52.560
there, it's, it's a pretty
straightforward development process. You could,

636
00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:55.230
if you wanted to, you
could avoid the interface builder,

637
00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:57.150
just like you might avoid
it and wind forms. If

638
00:35:57.150 --> 00:35:59.990
you wanted to build all
your interfaces out from, from

639
00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:04.830
C-sharp, you would be able
to do that. So, and

640
00:36:04.830 --> 00:36:06.630
then the next step is,
of course you build it

641
00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:10.380
and, and then you run
it. And, you know, like

642
00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:14.160
if you get our evaluation
version today, it, it supports

643
00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:16.320
all of this that we've
discussed so far and all

644
00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:19.650
this integration all the way
back to the iPhone simulator,

645
00:36:19.650 --> 00:36:21.810
that Apple ships in the
SDK as well. So as

646
00:36:21.810 --> 00:36:25.020
soon as you hit run
inside of inside model develop,

647
00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:27.690
it's going to fire up
the simulator and launch your

648
00:36:27.690 --> 00:36:30.240
application for you, and you
can interact with it, you

649
00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:32.180
know, right there on the
screen. And is there anything

650
00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:34.160
that you can't do? I
mean, this isn't like a

651
00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:37.790
technology prototype, is it, it's
not like a, like a,

652
00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:40.460
Oh, look at this kind
of thing. It's like somebody

653
00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:43.220
used to say, it's like
a William. Sometimes people put

654
00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:45.170
together a prototype, it's like
a three legged dog. You

655
00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:46.550
know, you, you know, he's
going to get where he's

656
00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:49.130
going, but it's just hard
to watch. Is this a

657
00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:51.650
toy or is this really,
can you really write an

658
00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:55.850
application? And C-sharp on an
iPhone that looks like one,

659
00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:58.550
Yeah, this is the product.
So it's a little different

660
00:36:58.550 --> 00:37:01.100
than, you know, maybe some
of the approaches that, that,

661
00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:02.600
you know, some of the
cool things we've done with

662
00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:07.600
mano in the past, but
no, it's, I mean, the

663
00:37:07.610 --> 00:37:10.700
entire experience is very streamlined.
And when, like I said,

664
00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:13.070
I just described it in
the evaluation version. You could

665
00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:14.840
develop, you know, you can
go get that for free.

666
00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:16.910
It doesn't, you know, it
doesn't time expire or anything.

667
00:37:17.140 --> 00:37:20.390
And you could develop your
application against the simulator. What

668
00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:24.260
the evaluation version doesn't support
is actually deploying to the

669
00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:28.040
device. You know, that's, that's
the product we sell. So,

670
00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:31.850
but it supports all of
that in the end and

671
00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:33.590
you pay him, you're paying
for it, so you should

672
00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:35.510
expect it to You're paying
for it. So, I mean,

673
00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:37.700
it's, well, I mean, that's,
that's, that's kind of interesting.

674
00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:39.230
I didn't mean to actually
do that, but it sounds

675
00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:42.650
like I kind of stepped
in the, I think I

676
00:37:42.650 --> 00:37:45.500
made an indirect comparison against
open source software that like,

677
00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:47.420
Hey, if it works great,
if it doesn't work, sorry,

678
00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:49.160
you know, go figure it
out for it. And you

679
00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:51.050
actually emphasize that when you
say, well, this is a

680
00:37:51.050 --> 00:37:54.170
product. I don't know if
I'm, I didn't mean to

681
00:37:54.170 --> 00:37:55.730
do that, but it almost
sounds like we're saying, well,

682
00:37:55.730 --> 00:37:57.410
this is a product. So
you really can expect it

683
00:37:57.410 --> 00:38:01.150
to work really well. Both
motto and motto touch are,

684
00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:03.500
are things that are in
production. Real people are doing

685
00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:05.810
real work on these things
today, right? I mean, there

686
00:38:05.810 --> 00:38:07.700
are apps I can get
with touch that are in

687
00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:10.370
the app store. You know,
I don't, I don't know

688
00:38:10.370 --> 00:38:13.130
if there are mano touch
ones on the app store

689
00:38:13.130 --> 00:38:15.530
today because of the length
of time for the approval

690
00:38:15.530 --> 00:38:19.430
process. And we just launched
one on touch, like I

691
00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:23.510
said, two weeks ago. And,
you know, we had the

692
00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:25.790
beta program only running a
short time before that, because

693
00:38:25.790 --> 00:38:32.420
this was actually all a
very aggressive production. So within

694
00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:34.600
the beta program, we didn't,
we didn't give out the,

695
00:38:34.610 --> 00:38:37.720
you know, we give out
the license to, to build

696
00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:40.150
apps for, you know, a
go live license like you

697
00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:43.600
would be familiar with. So
we, we don't have that,

698
00:38:43.870 --> 00:38:46.210
but it's probably worth pointing
out a little bit of

699
00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:48.430
the history of how, how
mano touch came to be,

700
00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:54.520
which is that we license
mano to various companies for

701
00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:59.170
various purposes when they need
to, to have a commercial

702
00:38:59.170 --> 00:39:02.020
license of mano, rather than,
you know, just what's provided

703
00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:04.870
by the open source licenses.
And in one particular case,

704
00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:09.520
a game company called unity,
licensed mano for use in

705
00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:12.880
their game engine, which they
have for windows, Mac, the

706
00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:18.490
Nintendo wi and ultimately the
iPhone. Correct. Yeah. We actually

707
00:39:18.490 --> 00:39:20.830
offer motto on the way.
So if there's any, you

708
00:39:20.830 --> 00:39:23.890
know, any way developers out
there, you know, give us

709
00:39:23.890 --> 00:39:26.620
a call. We can, you
know, I can't put the

710
00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:29.100
wheat port of Manoa. Wow.
So Scott, we need to

711
00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:31.020
have a, we need to
have a motto on the,

712
00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:34.290
we talk at models at
Bano space, get on that.

713
00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:37.500
Are you going to, are
you going to do, it

714
00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:38.850
sounds like I'm going to
have to, since it's an

715
00:39:38.850 --> 00:39:42.540
open space conference, it would
be interesting to talk about,

716
00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:44.670
you know, whether or not
we should have some people

717
00:39:44.670 --> 00:39:54.540
have actually talked about doing
game development session. Yeah, definitely.

718
00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:58.470
There's a lot of interesting
games with mano before we

719
00:39:58.470 --> 00:40:00.000
go off on that tangent.
And that might even be

720
00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.610
the place to go, you
know, let me go ahead.

721
00:40:02.610 --> 00:40:04.740
And, and me get to
the point of the unity

722
00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:08.040
story, which is that unity
license model for use on

723
00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:12.690
the iPhone about a year
ago. And so they have

724
00:40:12.690 --> 00:40:14.790
a few hundred apps in
the app store that have

725
00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:17.700
model in it already. So
you know why we don't

726
00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:19.380
have the mono touch apps
out there. There's plenty of

727
00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:22.140
them using motto and using
the technology. And in fact,

728
00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:25.800
I actually saw an announcement
yesterday that I think five

729
00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:28.170
of the top 100 apps
on the app store were

730
00:40:28.170 --> 00:40:31.830
produced with unity. Wow. Well,
this is the thing though,

731
00:40:31.830 --> 00:40:33.630
if you're doing it right,
you're not supposed to know.

732
00:40:33.870 --> 00:40:36.060
Right. I mean, this has
always been the thing whenever

733
00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:39.030
I use an application and
discover that it's running.net and

734
00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:40.740
I never even thought about
it until I kind of

735
00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:44.670
stumbled upon it, you know,
using some introspective developer tool.

736
00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:47.070
I always realized that, no,
okay, good. This is, this

737
00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:50.020
is success. You know, whether
the applications written in, in,

738
00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:52.740
in tickle or whether it's
written in mano or whether

739
00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:56.880
it's written in Delphi, it
doesn't matter. As long as

740
00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:59.190
it's a great app. People
don't care. I think it's

741
00:40:59.190 --> 00:41:00.930
just the developer in us
that wants to go into

742
00:41:00.930 --> 00:41:02.520
the app store search for
the word mono and they

743
00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:04.350
get the list of all
of the different applications. Yeah.

744
00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:08.010
I think you're completely correct.
And yeah, I mean, our

745
00:41:08.010 --> 00:41:10.980
goal in particularly with mano
attach is we want an

746
00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:14.790
app that looks like it
belongs on the iPhone. And

747
00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:16.260
that's why we made a
lot of the decisions we

748
00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:19.170
made. I mean, originally when,
when we announced mean, when

749
00:41:19.170 --> 00:41:22.230
we started talking about unity,
I, I started getting tons

750
00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:24.780
of emails every week that
were, how do I get,

751
00:41:25.050 --> 00:41:26.460
you know, how do I
get motto on the iPhone?

752
00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:30.360
And the answer was, well,
you know, unless you're producing

753
00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:33.090
a game engine, we don't
really have a useful port

754
00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:36.110
for you. You can go
get unity and you can

755
00:41:36.110 --> 00:41:39.680
make an app that looks
like a game, but there's

756
00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:41.480
really no story for how
do you make an app

757
00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:43.880
that looks like an iPhone
now. And, and with mano

758
00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:45.650
touch, I mean, that's what
we did. We bound all

759
00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:49.010
the native APIs or like
significant portion of them. And,

760
00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:51.830
and that's why you use
their interface builder. So at

761
00:41:51.830 --> 00:41:53.540
the end of the day,
yeah, it should use or

762
00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:58.060
shouldn't know. Very cool. Very
cool. Well, Joseph and Scott,

763
00:41:58.090 --> 00:42:00.250
thanks a lot for giving
us kind of an overview

764
00:42:00.250 --> 00:42:02.410
of the, of the mono
ecosystem. It tells us a

765
00:42:02.410 --> 00:42:03.880
lot of interesting stuff. We
didn't even get a chance

766
00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:06.910
to talk about Moonlight, the,
the mano, a mano and

767
00:42:06.910 --> 00:42:09.880
Silverlight people can learn all
about that. It does it

768
00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:14.170
go hyphen mano.com, Correct? Yeah.
That's probably the shortest URL.

769
00:42:14.890 --> 00:42:18.370
They can get Moonlight Moonlight.
Very cool. And then they

770
00:42:18.370 --> 00:42:22.180
can learn about monospace at
monospace dot U S. This

771
00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:24.910
has been another episode of
Hansel minutes, and I'll see

772
00:42:24.910 --> 00:42:25.840
you again next week.
