Hey friends backlog is an
all-in-one project and code management

13
00:00:49.900 --> 00:01:06.400
minutes. Hi, this is Scott
Hanselman. This is another episode

14
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.100
of Hansel minutes. Today. I'm
talking with Clyde w4d at

15
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.400
the author of think black
is a fantastic book and

16
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.900
he's been running all over
the country talking about it.

17
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.300
And now he's going to
talk to us today. I'm

18
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.100
looking at an amazing picture
here, sir with is a

19
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.200
picture of your dad on
the steps of IBM with

20
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:30.000
what looks like about 20
middle-aged white folks to women

21
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.100
and your dad's in the
back. They're kind of like

22
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.000
giving us the the Died
through history. What's going on

23
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.100
here? Yeah. This was a
picture Scott. And first thanks

24
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.400
to thank you for inviting
me on this podcast. This

25
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.100
was a picture of my
dad taken in the early

26
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.800
1950s. Not long after he
became the first black software

27
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.500
engineer hired by IBM was
actually hired by IBM in

28
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.000
1946 went to work at
1947 for the company and

29
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.300
worked there for 37 years
what I found particularly interesting

30
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.200
about this picture. And didn't
really get to it until

31
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.500
it had been published in
the book is to look

32
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.400
at where the eyes of
everybody are looking if you

33
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.900
see that my dad and
the women are all looking

34
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.500
away and all of the
other men in the picture

35
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.900
are looking directly at the
camera almost as if to

36
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.200
say, I belong while my
dad and the women are

37
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.100
kind of questioning whether they
do belong in that frame.

38
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.400
Yeah. It isn't it is
an interesting awkward thing like,

39
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.100
you know, you don't know
what to read into and

40
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.500
what not to read into
when you look at a

41
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.900
photograph like this. Why are
people position where they are

42
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.600
you know your dad in
the women are all kind

43
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.400
of together within a foot
of each other your dad's

44
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.300
in the back? Maybe it's
by height. Maybe it's maybe

45
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.600
it's raised. Who knows but
there is a certain sense

46
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.200
of like here's all these
people that work at IBM

47
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.000
and then also these two
other people that are being

48
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.400
effectively other dude. Yeah, and
you don't know you're absolutely

49
00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.000
right. And I think that
questioning is exactly what this

50
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.100
book was all about for
me trying to better understand

51
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.200
the times when my dad
was hired at the company

52
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.200
and what that meant for
him as a black man

53
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.400
what that meant for me
as his son who later

54
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.700
went to work for the
company. Yeah, trying to understand

55
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.000
what these things are when
we're living in 2020. It's

56
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
an exercise in in historical
empathy. You know we go

57
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.400
and we see movies like
hidden figures and we think

58
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.600
what it must be like,
but we only spend two

59
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.400
hours watching a movie like
that. We see one or

60
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.400
two awkward things where you
know, Taraji Henson and hidden

61
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.400
figures is asked to get
some coffee and she has

62
00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.000
to assert her her right
to be there. And then

63
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.400
you say oh, wow that
was awful and then you

64
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.900
leave the movie and then
it's over but he spent

65
00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.300
30 how many years their
37 years 37 years. Like

66
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.900
was it like that? 365
Days out in the dick

67
00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.400
was there ever a safe
space was ever a moment

68
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.300
in you know, how many
years 10 20 years do

69
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.000
you get to go in
and feel like you belong?

70
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.500
Yeah, and I think that's
a great question. And I

71
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.600
think the answer is yes,
there were obviously times when

72
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.100
the Prejudice that he did
face wasn't right in his

73
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.600
face. And so there was
that opportunity to relax or

74
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.300
at least feel comfortable and
what he was doing. Look

75
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:22.400
my dad did things like
he was he actually maintained

76
00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.800
the data division of the
first ever COBOL compiler and

77
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.900
I can remember times when
he was quite proud of

78
00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.700
doing something like that. He
took me down for example

79
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.700
to do memory checks on
an IBM 708 and boy

80
00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.500
and those days, you know
here you have to K

81
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.800
of memory Opera occupying a
half a city block and

82
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.800
a memory check took all
weekend. Whereas now we do

83
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.600
a memory check of a
gig in less than a

84
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.700
couple of milliseconds. So there
were times when I think

85
00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:54.300
my dad was relaxed enjoyed
what he did recognize He

86
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.800
was doing was being important,
but there are also times

87
00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.300
when he really had to
fight to maintain his position

88
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.500
and to try to make
some inroads into change at

89
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.700
a company which like many
companies of the day were

90
00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:12.300
resistant to the diversity and
inclusion that they even said

91
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.400
they were all about. What
were the qualifications? How are

92
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.300
this even start? Like, I
have a pretty good idea

93
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.100
of how I would get
my son's into software or

94
00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.200
Hardware today. It would probably
we start with an undergraduate

95
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.400
degree of some kind depending
on whether they were interested

96
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.000
in going beyond that. So
there's a barrier there but

97
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.600
also just natural inclination, but
I'm trying to imagine in

98
00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.200
the in the in the
40s as he is growing

99
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.600
up and preparing himself. Did
he have a natural mind

100
00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.600
for for the logic of
the time of computers or

101
00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.900
was it math? What was
the thing that he had

102
00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:51.000
that let him? Yeah. And
yeah, and that's again a

103
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.700
great question back in the
early in the middle. Ortiz

104
00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.000
late 40s, even when I
was hired at IBM, you

105
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.200
know, you couldn't go and
get a computer science degree.

106
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.200
So the question is, how
did you prepare? I don't

107
00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.200
think my dad prepared for
a career in computers that

108
00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.800
wasn't even on the table
is in his mind. He

109
00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.800
prepared for a career in
accounting computers at the dawn

110
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:20.200
of the digital age were
basically split into two tracks

111
00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.200
one was a scientific track
and the other was a

112
00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:27.100
commercial business. Bonus track the
commercial and business track really

113
00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:31.700
focused on early computers taking
over the accounting functions of

114
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:35.000
the business. So consequently if
you were looking for somebody

115
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.100
to work with the early
computers you were looking for

116
00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.900
somebody who is really good
at business and in particular

117
00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.800
at accounting. That's what my
dad went to school for

118
00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.500
at city college in New
York. And that's where Watson

119
00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.300
found him. Ah, so when
we say Watson found him

120
00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:55.400
Thomas Watson from IBM found
your dad. Absolutely Watson and

121
00:06:55.500 --> 00:07:00.000
my dad actually met Watson
because his accounting professor invited

122
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.300
him by her house for
dinner. I believe and what

123
00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.800
my dad said many times
was he walked into her

124
00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:12.900
apartment and was surprised by
Thomas Watson stepping out and

125
00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.900
offering him a job, but
saying very clearly to my

126
00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:19.800
dad. Look, I'm the only
person in this company who

127
00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:23.100
could offer you this job.
Wow. Oh, so would it

128
00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:25.500
be fair to say that
Thomas Watson flexed and kind

129
00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:28.700
of offered his lended lent
his privilege to make that

130
00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:33.800
happen. Yeah, I think my
dad had that sense whether

131
00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:37.800
Watson was doing it because
he knew he was conveying

132
00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.700
that privilege to my dad
or whether there was an

133
00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:45.000
ulterior motive behind it that
I really question and write

134
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.200
about in the book. But
as far as my dad

135
00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:50.700
was concerned Watson was acting
as his hero or his

136
00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:54.600
champion and I think for
many years my dad felt

137
00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:59.400
there was some protection gained
from them I've talked about

138
00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:02.500
This with my mentorship groups
where we feel that the

139
00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:06.800
term mentorship goes beyond when
it becomes sponsorship and that

140
00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.500
for for real for real
change and for real opportunities

141
00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:11.900
to happen. It's great to
have a mentor but have

142
00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:14.200
a sponsor is someone to
bring you into a room

143
00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.900
and then let you shine
once you're in that room.

144
00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:22.600
Yeah, now again whether Watson
really was my dad sponsor

145
00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:27.500
or was a very Savvy
businessman who understood the public

146
00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:33.300
relations value of hiring African-Americans
and Jews shortly after World

147
00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:37.400
War II that I question
but there's no question about

148
00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:40.700
it that it was Watson's
word that allowed my dad

149
00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:43.500
to get hired at a
time when blacks really weren't

150
00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:47.200
hired into Technology field. My
dad was the second I

151
00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:51.300
can American hired by IBM
the first as a software

152
00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:54.400
or systems engineer as they
called them in those days

153
00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.900
and the other gentleman was
a salesperson, right? That's right.

154
00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:59.800
That was TJ Laster who
was hired as just a

155
00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:02.600
couple of months before my
dad as a Salesman and

156
00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:05.000
you make the assertion. I've
heard you make this assertion

157
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.100
that your dad is or
maybe the first black software

158
00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:12.400
engineer in America at the
time given, of course that

159
00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.400
it's hard to decide. What
was the software person when

160
00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:18.800
the titles really didn't exist.
Yeah, and and I know

161
00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:22.100
again it's an interesting question
and it is an assertion

162
00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:24.400
I make the truth of
the matter is Scott is

163
00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:28.500
saying that my dad was
a software engineer in 1949

164
00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.800
is somewhat of an anachronism
because there was no software.

165
00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.800
Excuse me in 1947 when
he was hired. There was

166
00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:38.700
no software then. My dad
was hired to work on

167
00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:43.600
IBM's first programmable computers for
which there was no software.

168
00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:46.200
Yes, there were card readers,
but you didn't write a

169
00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:49.300
program on. Cards cards are
only used for data in

170
00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:53.100
those early days of computing
my dad. However worked on

171
00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:57.500
machines like the 407 which
again was IBM's first commercially

172
00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:04.400
available programmable computer eventually that
Hardware gave rise to software.

173
00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:06.900
And as I said earlier,
my dad was right there

174
00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:10.600
at the beginning of that
process doing things like maintaining

175
00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:13.700
the data division of the
first COBOL compiler. So in

176
00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:17.100
that regard, my dad was
the first African American involvement.

177
00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.900
Evolved in software within IBM
and so I think it's

178
00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:23.900
a fair bet to say
he was the first black

179
00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:27.100
software engineer in America. That's
fantastic. One of the things

180
00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:29.300
that is overwhelming to me
as I try to look

181
00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:32.300
past look into history is
how are these in the

182
00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:34.500
forgive me of this is
a dumb question. But how

183
00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:38.200
are these computers even useful
like an IBM, you know,

184
00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:41.400
705 had a disk drive
with 60k of data on

185
00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:44.400
a drive. What would you
even do with that? Yeah,

186
00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:47.700
and it's and so 407
Diva did. Been have a

187
00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:51.000
disk drive all it had
was car a card reader

188
00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:56.700
at a typewriter head and
a drawer which you literally

189
00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:00.900
used a patch cord to
control how the circuitry work.

190
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
And basically I mean one
of the things on the

191
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.800
commercial side they used at
for was accounting your straight

192
00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:10.200
accounting that 407 could add
numbers and print out results

193
00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:13.700
faster than a human could
and with more accuracy as

194
00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:17.100
well to one of the
first uses of this type.

195
00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.700
Type of what used to
call unit record or card

196
00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:23.200
reading punched card equipment really
was for counting people and

197
00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:26.600
the senses and that's really
how the digital Revolution started

198
00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:29.100
at the turn of the
century. So the idea of

199
00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:34.500
counting anything you could count
tabulate sort control. That's what

200
00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:38.600
the early computers did and
that's really what their base

201
00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:42.100
is was in the commercial
field now in the scientific

202
00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:46.600
field those early computers, there
were two principal uses one

203
00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:49.600
was in Believe it or
not early weather prediction and

204
00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:53.100
the other was in in
the military with anything those

205
00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:57.500
early computers could do for
example to compute bomb trajectories

206
00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:01.300
or missile trajectories things like
that. My dad didn't work

207
00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:03.200
on that side of the
business. My dad worked on

208
00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:06.800
the commercial end and just
for folks who are listening

209
00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:10.700
really closely to understand the
scope of this 705 with

210
00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:15.300
20 K of memory has
won five hundred thousandths the

211
00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:18.200
memory capacity of an eight
gigabytes. Art phone and an

212
00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:22.100
8 gigabyte smartphone or typical
smartphone is almost 2 2

213
00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:26.300
million times faster than what
was the top-of-the-line computer at

214
00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:29.000
the time correct? We've had
is corrected and just to

215
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.700
add to that Scott a
705 with all the attended

216
00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:36.700
disk drives and tape drives
and and tabulators and sorters

217
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.300
you could get a computer
room that was probably on

218
00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:43.600
the order of 10 tons
or more compare that to

219
00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:46.500
your cell phone. That's you
know, not even 10 ounces

220
00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:49.600
and you get Sense of
the size and change that's

221
00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:52.500
happened over the past couple
of decades. Yeah, it's just

222
00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:55.500
it's so important. I feel
like Computer Science History isn't

223
00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:58.200
taught enough. I hope that
your book ends up being

224
00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:01.400
taught in schools because I
feel like there's such a

225
00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:04.800
an assumption as my as
my eleven-year-old picks up a

226
00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:07.400
pocket supercomputer and puts it
in his back pocket and

227
00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:10.800
wanders off to play Angry
Birds. The idea that we

228
00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:13.800
are standing on the shoulders
of giants is just it

229
00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:17.000
isn't even a big enough
phrase to express how much

230
00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:20.500
power we have in Computing
compared to what we did

231
00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:22.900
back in the day. Yes,
and I think that's one

232
00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:26.000
of the things also my
dad and his IBM colleagues

233
00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:30.700
recognized is how tremendous what
they were doing would be

234
00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:33.900
for the future. I think
where they may have not

235
00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:37.500
understand what they were doing
for the future is how

236
00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:41.700
well they were also unleashing
a technological monster that in

237
00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:45.000
the wrong hands could be
used in ways that they

238
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.500
might not have even predicted.
Well and you Out that

239
00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:50.200
the one of the first
uses was the census and

240
00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:54.300
Counting people and you might
we might be listening to

241
00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:57.100
this podcast and thinking what
counting people that's it's a

242
00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:59.600
pretty straightforward and stay had
kind of a thing to

243
00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:03.600
do but one of the
first uses of computers has

244
00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:07.900
in itself embedded questions of
ethics and you know, software

245
00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:13.200
itself being a political entity
counting people sounds harmless, but

246
00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:16.500
it depends on how you
go about it. Absolutely and

247
00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:22.000
so So one of IBM's
first ever large-scale projects was

248
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.600
counting people for the Eugenics
record office run out of

249
00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:29.500
Cold Springs Harbor New York
who are engaged in a

250
00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:34.200
project to count people and
to discriminate people. They were

251
00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:37.900
counting on the island of
Jamaica. So they could separate

252
00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:46.400
out mixed-raced individuals from Pure
Europeans for forced sterilization and

253
00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:51.200
other means of Population control
IBM software. Well, it wasn't

254
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:54.400
sore for then IBM Hardware
in the form of Punch

255
00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:58.600
Cards and punched cards equipment
was used to really make

256
00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:04.100
that Jamaica study a success
and that began a process

257
00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:10.100
Scott where IBM and its
hardware and other unit record

258
00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:14.200
punch card equipment was used
for example in Nazi Germany

259
00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:18.000
later in South Africa. And
so so you do get

260
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.800
the sense that just because
you can count people that

261
00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:26.700
always isn't necessarily a good
thing depending on who's doing

262
00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:30.400
the counting and trying to
make the discrimination and unfortunately,

263
00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:34.000
IBM's equipment was involved in
some of the worst uses

264
00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:37.500
of counting people that we
can imagine in the 20th

265
00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:42.100
century. Does your dashboard design
engage users and set your

266
00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:45.500

analyst firm Gartner the look

277
00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:33.900
It brings up very very
difficult ethical questions today because

278
00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:37.500
we are talking about facial
recognition if I go and

279
00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:40.200
do something as simple as
making a Open source blog

280
00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:42.300
and put it out there
and it turns into the

281
00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:46.000
most popular blog to be
spreading hate then, you know

282
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
one person might say well,
hey free software. This is

283
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.600
the whole point. I can't
control, you know, what direct

284
00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:54.400
here's a gun. I can't
control what direction someone points

285
00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:57.600
it but it's interesting that
even the very very first

286
00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:00.700
computer programs out. There can
be used for good or

287
00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:03.400
used for evil. Just as
I suppose a brick could

288
00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:06.700
be as well. Yes, and
I think that's important, you

289
00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:10.000
know, we talked earlier about
how in Computers we don't

290
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.700
have always that sense of
History. It's not just in

291
00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:18.600
terms of these wonderful technological
developments. We don't have that

292
00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:22.900
history. We don't have that
history of how this wonderful

293
00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:27.600
technology was used. And so
consequently, I see time and

294
00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:32.300
time again people who don't
understand that history recreating some

295
00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:36.300
of the very ethical challenges
that computers begin with back

296
00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:38.600
in the 20s and through
the 30s and 40s and

297
00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:42.100
50s as I said in
Eugenics the Holocaust and apartheid

298
00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:45.200
I'll just give you one
simple example and really you

299
00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.300
just pick up the newspaper
and you see it every

300
00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:52.700
day. There was a an
educational game on on slavery

301
00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:58.300
supposedly released several years ago
called slave Tetris and part

302
00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:00.800
of this game was you
drop slaves into the hold

303
00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:03.100
of a slave ship and
you move them back and

304
00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:06.600
forth to try to pack
them tightly now. I don't

305
00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:09.900
know who in their right
mind would Lisa game like

306
00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:13.200
that, but it was released
and the people who released

307
00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:16.500
it thought they were doing
something positive. Well, there was

308
00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:19.900
a huge outcry obviously and
eventually that game was pulled

309
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.200
but it's ideas like this
where you fail to understand

310
00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:28.200
how technology is actually applying
itself to various groups. I

311
00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:31.500
think it's really important to
kind of understand the history

312
00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:34.700
of where this technology has
been used and sometimes not

313
00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:38.000
for the best uses. Andy
died. It's important for us

314
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.100
to understand his storable context
when we do something as

315
00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:44.600
small as write a little
piece of software. Yeah, and

316
00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:46.800
I'll just give you another
example just a couple of

317
00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:52.000
days ago. I was reading
about Google's attempt to improve

318
00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:57.500
its facial recognition software by
taking small video cameras on

319
00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:03.100
you know, smartphones into homeless
shelters singling out black men

320
00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:05.200
because as we know there's
been a problem with how

321
00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:09.300
facial recognition software deals with
people of dark skin. But

322
00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:13.400
Google didn't tell these men
what they were using these

323
00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:17.100
video recordings for often didn't
even tell them they were

324
00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:21.300
making video recordings. And then
we're trying to use that

325
00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:24.800
to improve their facial recognition
software, you know, that is

326
00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:28.800
another example of how a
company might even be well-meaning

327
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.400
but doesn't understand the historical
context of how technology has

328
00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:37.600
been used against civil and
human rights and now committing

329
00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:41.000
an act which I think
any rational person sitting down

330
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.200
talking to them would say
wait a minute. There's got

331
00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:46.200
to be a better way
to do this. You're not

332
00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:50.000
going about it the right
way right in that example

333
00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:54.700
where the the larger goal
make facial recognition and make

334
00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:56.800
whether it be Google photos
or whatever. They're working on

335
00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:00.300
work better for people with
dark skin, certainly laudable and

336
00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:03.100
correct goal at then all
the way down to the

337
00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:06.700
leaf nodes having the street
team which were being paid

338
00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:10.100
$5 a head to just
Hunt down folks and take

339
00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:13.900
their picture without letting them
know totally a perversion of

340
00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:18.900
the ultimate correct goal. Absolutely
and again historically that goes

341
00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:24.700
back for example to right
after 9/11 when IBM attempting

342
00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:30.100
to improve its Watson facial
recognition technology used video recordings

343
00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:33.800
from the New York City
Police Department without the knowledge

344
00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:37.300
of the individuals. They were
using those recordings in an

345
00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:41.400
attempt to get there. So,
Software to better discriminate based

346
00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:44.400
on race and that goes
back to the use of

347
00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:48.300
software to discriminate based on
race. For example in South

348
00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:51.900
Africa, which goes back to
the use of hardware and

349
00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:56.200
punch cards to discriminate based
on race in Nazi Germany,

350
00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:59.300
which goes back right to
Eugenics. So I think my

351
00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:03.000
point is is that we
need to understand the line

352
00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:06.200
and the history of the
line that we can draw

353
00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:11.600
between the earliest somewhat. Verdant
uses of software and today

354
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.800
so that those of us
involved in this industry can

355
00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:19.900
make sure that things like
this don't happen. I want

356
00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:23.100
to shift a little bit
to talk about what you

357
00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:25.100
what you start talking about
in chapter 10, which is

358
00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:30.000
when WWE B Du Bois
talks about the concept of

359
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.400
double Consciousness yet, which also
could be applied to modern-day

360
00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:37.500
code-switching which is the idea
of being of two minds

361
00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:41.100
of two places. Not knowing
where you belong. You know,

362
00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:44.800
your father is is black
at home with his family.

363
00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:49.000
Is he also black only
when he's at work? What

364
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.100
is his position at work?
How does he move between

365
00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:56.700
these these spaces? Yeah. And
again, it's a great point

366
00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:59.300
to bring up and I
think one of the challenges

367
00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:01.600
of what it means or
what it meant to my

368
00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:07.300
father to be the first
black software engineer at IBM

369
00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:12.500
in America. Was this tremendous
pressure on the outside that

370
00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:17.400
he was quote somehow representing
his race. I heard that

371
00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:20.900
phrase so many times growing
up. I can't tell you

372
00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:25.000
and it was both an
honor and an incredible burden

373
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.700
because my dad felt that
somehow everything. He did would

374
00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:34.300
be looked out under a
microscope of the fact that

375
00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:38.100
he had dark skin and
as he began to realise

376
00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:41.200
that That he wasn't going
to get promotions he deserved

377
00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:43.400
maybe he wasn't going to
would be seeking to be

378
00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:47.000
forced actually to train people
who would later become his

379
00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.500
supervisors instead of looking to
the outside world and saying

380
00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:55.000
hey, there's something nitrite not
right here. My dad often

381
00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.200
turned that view inside and
said, I guess what's happening

382
00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:02.800
to me is because I'm
black and there was this

383
00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:07.600
almost self loathing of his
skin color as a human

384
00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:11.000
being that he Begin to
develop. He started to read

385
00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:16.600
books about author Murray and
that whole movement of intelligence

386
00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:19.800
and race and even though
those books were debunked. He

387
00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:25.000
still believed it that somehow
this helped him better understand

388
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.600
what was happening to him,
you know, the boys talked

389
00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:30.500
about this is double Consciousness.
We talked about it as

390
00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:34.400
internalized racism code-switching. There are
a number of different ways

391
00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:38.600
to look at this but
the fundamental underlying issue here.

392
00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:42.700
Is that as an African-American
my dad was turning the

393
00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:47.400
racism he experienced in the
outside world inside and thinking

394
00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:49.700
that he was the problem
even though he was an

395
00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:54.100
incredibly intelligent man on the
IBM Championship chess teams for

396
00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:57.500
a number of years played
for instruments was an operatic

397
00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:02.500
baritone was working in this
incredible field in high-tech still

398
00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:06.700
that basic idea that he
was less competent less capable

399
00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:10.500
less intelligent because of his
skin. Color crept into who

400
00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:13.600
he was and became an
issue that really was quite

401
00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:17.500
a challenge for me to
bridge with him and became

402
00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:20.600
a source of conflict between
us. So when we talk

403
00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:23.800
about imposter syndrome, and if
you apply what we think

404
00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:27.300
about is technology impostor syndrome
to that the two two

405
00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:32.600
voices concept of double Consciousness,
you are always questioning yourself

406
00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:35.500
and trying to find your
own Center as you as

407
00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:39.800
you navigate spaces. Absolutely and
I think Certainly, my dad

408
00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:44.100
as an African-American understood this
women in high-tech understand this

409
00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:47.000
as well and many people
who have this sense of

410
00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.900
do they belong and are
constantly trying to do something

411
00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:55.400
to themselves to justify either
belonging or what's happening to

412
00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:58.000
them. It's got we stalked
it early at the beginning

413
00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.600
of this podcast about that
picture that picture of my

414
00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:04.300
dad and the women there
and I think in some

415
00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:07.500
which specs that picture is
a great example of what

416
00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:10.500
we're talking about right now.
Now that sense of the

417
00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:13.100
Imposter send them do I
belong or do I don't

418
00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:15.700
do I not belong you
can look at the eyes

419
00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:18.100
of those folks and you
can see those who think

420
00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:20.800
yeah, I really belong and
those who are questioning that

421
00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:24.300
let me ask a hard
question that I think this

422
00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:26.500
if someone's made it this
far into the podcast they

423
00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:29.400
might be thinking why does
it always have to be

424
00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:32.800
about color? Why can't we
quote unquote just do our

425
00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:36.800
jobs? Why is that kind
of a dangerous bit of

426
00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:41.200
dismissiveness or is it It
yeah, I mean and that's

427
00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:44.200
obviously a great question. I
think it's a question that

428
00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:47.100
certainly comes up today more
so than it did in

429
00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:50.100
my dad's era and I
was writing this book about

430
00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:52.900
my dad's error. It would
be great if we could

431
00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:56.900
be a colorblind Society, but
we're not there. We're certainly

432
00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:59.400
not opposed to racial Society
even though a lot of

433
00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:02.200
people thought when we elected
a black president, that would

434
00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:05.200
be the case. The truth
of the matter is when

435
00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:09.100
you're doing your job and
just doing your job. But

436
00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:11.700
you're not getting the promotion's
you receive your that you

437
00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:15.100
should receive your having to
train people who later become

438
00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:19.100
those who manage you when
you look at the diversity

439
00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:22.600
or lack of diversity around
you when you look at

440
00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:26.700
software and high-tech products released
that don't address the needs

441
00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:31.400
of everybody particularly people of
color and minorities. Then you

442
00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:34.700
do have to take into
account race. You do have

443
00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:38.100
to take into account diversity
and inclusion simply looking at

444
00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:43.900
the Alex that the high-tech
industry generates and their disproportionate

445
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.500
negative impact for example on
people of color. You've got

446
00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:51.200
to ask yourself why but
also more importantly Scott. I

447
00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.700
think you've got to look
at the steps. You can

448
00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:57.100
take that might change that
that's what I'm really about.

449
00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:59.400
How do we get to
that place where we can

450
00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:03.500
say we're just doing our
jobs knowing that just doing

451
00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:07.700
our jobs means we're going
to take into account ways

452
00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:12.000
that we don't Reduce bias
into the high-tech products that

453
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.200
we develop which is which
is really to say that

454
00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:20.100
we do the goal is
to not be biased and

455
00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:24.700
that starts with an acknowledgement
that everything starts out biased

456
00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:28.400
whether it is intentionally biased
or not. Right? Yeah. I

457
00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:31.000
think the goal is to
be able to in the

458
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.800
high-tech field produced products that
are not biased there are

459
00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:38.400
ways to go about that
but the biggest way not

460
00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:40.700
to go. Oh about that
is just to do nothing

461
00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:44.200
and to just assume that
you're going to generate non

462
00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:48.300
bias code and non-biased products
that is not the case

463
00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:52.000
and we can cite example
after example where the software

464
00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:57.400
created today the algorithms generated
today have bias within them,

465
00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:00.400
you know, in fact because
the developers who are doing

466
00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:03.600
them have their own implicit
bias. All of us have

467
00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:07.400
this implicit bias. The question
is can we become enough

468
00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:10.400
aware of it? So that
Doesn't creep or seep into

469
00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:14.100
the code that we create.
There was a letter that

470
00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:18.600
Thomas Watson son Thomas J
Watson jr. Wrote In 1953

471
00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:22.400
called policy letter for was
that a tell us what

472
00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:24.600
that was and was that
a Savvy move or was

473
00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:28.800
that what he believed? Yeah.
So policy letter number four

474
00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:33.200
is really taken by many
people as an important milestone

475
00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:38.300
in the diversity and inclusion
movement among firms policy letter.

476
00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:40.900
Or was a letter that
I buy that Thomas J

477
00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:45.900
Watson jr. Sent out to
all IBM employees stating IBM's

478
00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:50.200
gold to hire to promote
not on the basis of

479
00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:55.600
race. I think IBM like
any company almost has there's

480
00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:57.800
kind of two ways in
which you can look at

481
00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:02.200
them one. I think that
probably expressed the belief that

482
00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:05.200
Watson want it for his
company, but at the same

483
00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:09.100
time that was happening I
was there watching my There

484
00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:12.100
again not getting the promotion
see what he deserved and

485
00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:15.700
hiring or excuse me training
people that later went on

486
00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:21.100
to become his manager. So
part of that is aspirational

487
00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:23.700
on the part of IBM
and I have to say

488
00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:26.100
that looking at IBM's history
as I do on the

489
00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:30.100
book part of it is
also really Sabe public relations

490
00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:34.300
IBM and Watson both the
old man as we used

491
00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:37.700
to call them and the
sun were really gifted public

492
00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:41.300
relations folks. Oaks and so
I think you've got both

493
00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:45.000
things going on there at
the same time when your

494
00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.300
dad was the first the
challenge is not just to

495
00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:52.100
be the first but to
certainly Remain the first and

496
00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:55.400
set up the second third
and 1 mm up for

497
00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:59.100
Success. What were some things
that he did to set

498
00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:02.200
Folks up for Success so
that he was not the

499
00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:05.200
first and last yeah, and
this is one of the

500
00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:07.800
funniest stories. I think I
tell in the book funny

501
00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:11.300
because It has to do
with my dad's dresser drawer

502
00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:15.200
and what I discovered in
an envelope beneath his Playboy

503
00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:20.200
magazines. So beneath his Playboy
magazines. I actually discovered something

504
00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:23.200
I think was more risque
than what was between the

505
00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:26.500
pages of those Playboy magazines.
And that was that my

506
00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:32.400
dad had bootlegged copies of
the IBM entrance examination questions

507
00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:38.500
and answers and he would
share those with Selective selective.

508
00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:42.700
It young mostly black man
that he felt deserved a

509
00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:45.700
leg up and trying to
get into the company. Now.

510
00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:48.800
I think this happened after
the point that my dad

511
00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:52.100
realized. He had hit a
glass ceiling and was not

512
00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:54.700
going to go much further
in the company. So he

513
00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:58.300
was looking around for ways
to help others my dad

514
00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:01.100
also and I've described him
this way and a couple

515
00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:03.500
of times my dad was
a street fighter and a

516
00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:06.700
business suit and I think
he understood that you play

517
00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:10.100
this game in such a
way. That you sometimes have

518
00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:13.800
to use the very tactics
that are used against you

519
00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:18.700
and that's why he I
think ran an underground railroad.

520
00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:20.900
I think that's a good
word to describe it to

521
00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:24.600
bring promising young black men
into the company who might

522
00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:28.100
succeed and go beyond where
he was able to go.

523
00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:30.800
Does that stood that set
them up for success or

524
00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:33.400
does that take a risk
at and when you take

525
00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:35.700
a risk when you refer
someone when I refer someone

526
00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:38.500
to work I'm doing the
best I can to help.

527
00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:42.100
Hopefully set someone up but
if they burn me by

528
00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:46.600
not doing well, then I'm
basically set up the next

529
00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:50.400
person for failure. Absolutely. And
I think the answer to

530
00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:53.100
that question is yes, obviously,
it's a risk, but I

531
00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:56.300
also think my dad was
somewhat Sabi and selective in

532
00:31:56.300 --> 00:32:00.000
who it was that he
tutored or mentored or a

533
00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.800
gave this leg up with.
Of course, you have no

534
00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:05.500
way of knowing exactly how
a person is going to

535
00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:09.600
handle themselves, but there was
also So this kind of

536
00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:13.900
code among the first blacks
in many different fields who

537
00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:17.500
understood the eyes of the
world. So to speak or

538
00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:20.400
felt the eyes of the
world were watching them. And

539
00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:23.900
so there was a sense
of let's say a little

540
00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:28.200
more pressure on them to
do well than somebody who

541
00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:32.000
isn't the first or among
the first in a field

542
00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.500
so people in this in
this instance who were effectively

543
00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:37.800
the Jesse Owens of software
knew that and felt the

544
00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:40.700
pressure of that. At and
all eyes on them to

545
00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:45.200
succeed absolutely just like Jackie
Robinson and baseball and I

546
00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:46.900
grew up in an area
of the Bronx where there

547
00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:49.900
were many first in different
fields. I would go to

548
00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:53.600
my grandparents house and be
introduced to the first black

549
00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:57.500
fire department lieutenant in the
first black police department Captain

550
00:32:57.500 --> 00:33:00.100
and the first black lawyer
and so there was a

551
00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:03.500
sense in this Williams Bridge
community of the Bronx in

552
00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:07.700
New York that these was
a community of first who

553
00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:13.700
understood Ed that how they
performed would really influence how

554
00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:17.600
those who came after them
had the opportunity to perform.

555
00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:19.700
Well, thank you so much
