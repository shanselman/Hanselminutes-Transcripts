In this episode, Scott and

9
00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:05.630
Carl discussed the year 2007
in review for developers. Hi,

10
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.940
this is Carl Franklin and you're
listening to Hansel minutes from

11
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.370
Hanselman it's dot com. It's
good to be back talking

12
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.340
to you and talking to
Scott again. Hi Scott. Hello,

13
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.890
sir. How was your Paternity
leave? Well, I'm still on

14
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.710
like three hours sleep. Baby's
up every couple of hours,

15
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.590
so yeah, we're tired, but
you know, it's good. He's

16
00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.230
about a seven, six and
a half, seven weeks old.

17
00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.410
Now he's about 12 pounds
eating well, healthy baby, all

18
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.660
the fingers and toes. So
we're happy. What's his name?

19
00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:38.720
His name's Tabo Tabo means
happiness. Awesome. Yeah, we're pretty,

20
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.600
we're pretty excited and Denzo
is enjoying, enjoying the little

21
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.380
baby. Well, get my best
Timo and, and the kids.

22
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.770
And let's talk about the
year interview. All right. So

23
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.350
yeah, this is the first
a fresh Hansel minutes, the,

24
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.870
the new year here. And
I was thinking we basically

25
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.240
just talk a little bit
about 2007 and you know,

26
00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.890
what it saw and then
what we're going to see

27
00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.200
change in 2008, going to
make some bold predictions. I

28
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.790
don't know if I'm going
any bull. Every time I

29
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.290
come up with a bold
prediction and ends up being

30
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.410
completely wrong. So, gosh, I
don't know. I mean Silverlight

31
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.050
to, Oh, we'll ship. I
think that's a pretty, not

32
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.230
a bold prediction considering that
it's the 1st of January, right? Yep.

33
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.550
Gosh, that's a good question.
You caught me off guard.

34
00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.160
All right, we'll get to
that. Now let's talk about

35
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.760
changes for the developer. What
what's changed, what changed this

36
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.310
year for the developer? Well,
I think that it's fair

37
00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.010
to say that dotnet one
X is, is seen its

38
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.440
day and that we all
should be moving off of.net

39
00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.980
1.0, and at least being
on two. Oh, when I

40
00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.170
say two, Oh, I really
mean the two Oh CLR.

41
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.570
Not necessarily whether you're on
2005 or 2008, but it's

42
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.760
really time to be inside
the dotnet two. Oh, CLR.

43
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.240
I would think, I think
that, you know, in the

44
00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.430
coming months, when we see
the release of a windows

45
00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.640
server 2008, I think that
it's definitely gonna be time

46
00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.820
to upgrade those 2000 servers
or 2003 servers that you

47
00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.290
might certainly, there's no excuse
to be running windows 2000

48
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.360
server that I can think
of. I mean, all of

49
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.720
my servers are 2003, right.
And for me, the really

50
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.890
compelling reason to upgrade to
2008, I've actually just upgraded

51
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.200
a couple of machines to
2008. One of the release

52
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.190
candidates just recently is the,
the virtualization stuff. Right. I

53
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.380
mean, being able to have
the built in virtualization. So

54
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.530
I've taken a couple of
old machines, including a couple

55
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.920
of wind 98 <inaudible> machines
and just kind of virtualized

56
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.360
them and stuck them on
that machine. So I don't

57
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.270
have to think about them
anymore. So I would say

58
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.770
actually I'm thinking that 2008
virtualization's to hit the mainstream,

59
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.960
if it hasn't already, right?
Yeah. Yeah. That's certainly good.

60
00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.190
I don't think that's a
controversial, controversial statement. No, I

61
00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.010
don't think so either. It's,
it's certainly some great new

62
00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.960
stuff. Not necessarily developer oriented,
but you know, certainly developers

63
00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.790
bump up against that stuff.
I was going to say,

64
00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.190
I think that that, that
is developer oriented. I think

65
00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.320
that that what serve more
and more of the developers

66
00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.670
have to think about what
server that they're going to

67
00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.890
be running on because there's
services that are available to

68
00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.430
them on those servers that
they, they may not know.

69
00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:07.650
They may not ordinarily have.
I mean, I still get

70
00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.110
emails sometimes saying, you know,
why can't I get dotnet

71
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.530
to around when 95? Sure
enough. So you never really

72
00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.180
know what you're going to
be up against. And of

73
00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.580
course, if you've got a
2008 machine or a Vista

74
00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:20.280
machine, and that's what you're
developing for, you've already got

75
00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.160
those services on it, you
know, you can do, but

76
00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.330
develop for Avalon. I mean,
WPF. Yeah. Honestly, I'm looking

77
00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.090
for a segue to visual
studio 2008, which is really

78
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.770
the big story of, of
2007. Yeah. I switched over

79
00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.090
everything to 2008. It really
is wonderful. Initially I was

80
00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.820
concerned that, you know, I'm
going to keep a 2005

81
00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.330
machine around just in case.
Right. Cause I didn't really

82
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.430
kind of believe that the
multi targeting was going to

83
00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.610
work, but you know, every
application that I had that

84
00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:55.380
was a two Oh 2005
application just upgraded very cleanly

85
00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.200
and was able to, to,
to still build. So being

86
00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.800
able to target to, Oh,
from 2008, definitely made it

87
00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.050
worthwhile to upgrade and then
get all of the benefits

88
00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.440
of, of the ID. And
then of course, code rush

89
00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.770
three Oh, is coming out
and supports 2008. So then

90
00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.010
that was the last reason
to, to wait. Right. And

91
00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.380
since the two that visual
studio, 2008, based on the

92
00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.100
2005 code base, you know,
it's got all the, all

93
00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.140
of the stability. I've only
had it crash maybe once

94
00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.240
or twice. And it was
an add in that caused

95
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.420
the crash. So I don't
feel bad at all about

96
00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:31.020
recommending visual studio 2008 for,
for folks to start using

97
00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.190
as their main machines you've
switched over, haven't you? Yeah,

98
00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:40.440
absolutely. I'm loving it. The,
of course the, you know,

99
00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.410
visual studio and.net, aren't the
only things that have changed

100
00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:46.740
for developers this year. There've
been a whole suite of

101
00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.100
languages that have people learned
about this year. A lot

102
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.380
of people in the dinette
space learned about this year,

103
00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.910
especially the dynamic languages. Well,
yeah, there's all this stuff

104
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.240
on with the DLR. I
think that in 2008, we're

105
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.310
going to see a lot
of information going on about

106
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.160
when the, when the DLR
will be considered, you know,

107
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.690
finished. And I think that
since rails Ruby on rails

108
00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.960
2.0 finished, basically just at
the end of last year

109
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.990
in December, that that's going
to get people more excited

110
00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:18.800
about rails. And then we've
got the MVC framework for

111
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.050
asp.net. That'll be coming out
in the first half of

112
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.650
2008 balancing all this stuff.
There's a lot of interest

113
00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:28.850
in, in dynamic languages, in
an alternate or alternative web

114
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:33.500
frameworks. I think there's definitely
a resurgence of MVC, separate

115
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.160
from asp.net MVC. You've got
rails. Of course, you get

116
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.950
to Django in different MVC
frameworks. I think it'll be

117
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:44.030
really interesting to see how
they, the monorail team decides

118
00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:47.660
to integrate things. Are they
going to pull an asp.net

119
00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:51.380
MVC in and extend it
and expand on it, add

120
00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:54.200
things like the, the castle
Windsor and version of control

121
00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.860
container and things like that.
And then to see, are

122
00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:02.120
we going to see a
rails on.net this year? I

123
00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.880
don't know, you know, will
we see ruby.net and running

124
00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:08.720
rails or will we find
people writing asp.net, MVC applications

125
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.870
and using rails for their,
for their views perhaps. Yeah.

126
00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:14.300
And you're not much of
a rails guy, right? You

127
00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:18.250
haven't drank that rail. I
really haven't. And quite frankly,

128
00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:20.140
I'm very happy with the
tools that I have for

129
00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:23.320
what I do personally, but
I'm not probably a good

130
00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.660
judge as an I'm not,
I'm not a normal developer,

131
00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:28.750
you know? Oh yeah. That's
cool though. You know, the

132
00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:30.580
thing is it is about
being happy in your own

133
00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.740
skin and being happy with,
with what you're using. But

134
00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:35.680
I think we can always
learn from these other alternative

135
00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.170
frameworks. So when I say
alternative, I mean not whatever

136
00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:40.510
we are using in this
case. Right. Seen it, you

137
00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:42.520
know, I've seen Ruby on
rails and I like it.

138
00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.620
I mean, I think it's,
I think it's really cool

139
00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.770
for what it does and
it is great to look

140
00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:50.470
at these things and learn
from them. Now, if you

141
00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:54.880
played with subsonic with subsonic
yeah. A little bit. Yeah.

142
00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:59.710
I think that subsonic is
really coming into its own

143
00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:02.700
this year. And I think
that now that the, that

144
00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:06.160
Rob is going to be
working for Microsoft, that there's

145
00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:07.930
going to be a little
bit of a war, I

146
00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:10.690
think in 2008, about how
are we going to generate

147
00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:12.940
our data access layers? Because
I think that there's more

148
00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:15.880
choice now than ever Well,
and I think there might

149
00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.280
be more choice than people
signed up for, and that,

150
00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:20.050
that may be part of
the problem. There are so

151
00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:24.490
many, there are so many,
you know, ORM tools and

152
00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:30.040
things that approach RM cogeneration,
middle layer generators, there's so

153
00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:32.980
much now. And then there's
stuff that Microsoft has. So

154
00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:35.680
I don't envy people who
are trying to make those

155
00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:38.350
decisions. Cause there's so many
tools to look at. And

156
00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:40.930
so many people seem to
have success with a lot

157
00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:44.170
of them. So Yeah, it
might be time for us

158
00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:47.380
to do a show about
that because you've got subsonic

159
00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:51.370
and you've got castle active
record, which is the data

160
00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:53.860
access layer that comes with
the castle project. It's a

161
00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:58.800
implementation, the active record pattern
for.net. You've got things like

162
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:02.610
doodads from my generation and
you've got to all the

163
00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:05.880
different or, or M things
that we're familiar with, like

164
00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:08.360
in the list There's is
literally a hundred products, long,

165
00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:11.840
easy, Well indefinitely. The, the
list of ones that people

166
00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:15.860
would shortlist is probably at
least 10. Yeah. And that's

167
00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:19.610
a lot. And if you
consider that making a decision

168
00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:23.390
like that is a fairly
constraining thing, I mean, you

169
00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:24.830
are really limited to what
your dad is gonna allow

170
00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:26.690
you to do while we
love Also learned about the

171
00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:29.390
entity framework this year. Yeah.
And that's going to be

172
00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:31.190
a real point of confusion.
And I think we should

173
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:32.960
definitely focus on doing a
couple of shows on that

174
00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.520
because I think that there's
some, some confusion in that.

175
00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:37.160
And I like to hear
back from listeners on this,

176
00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:41.900
that there's some confusion in
the community between the ATO

177
00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:45.590
entity framework and linked to
SQL and how one is

178
00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:50.120
more of a link over
the physical representation of your

179
00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:53.420
database. Well, the entity framework
provides an extra layer of

180
00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:57.050
abstraction to give you a
more logical views that isn't

181
00:09:57.050 --> 00:10:00.050
necessarily married directly to the
database as, as tightly as

182
00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:03.980
linked to SQL is. But
those, those aren't obvious things

183
00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:05.900
to figure out. And I
think that we should definitely

184
00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:08.000
do the best we can
to help clarify that because

185
00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:11.240
you know, Microsoft is, I've
learned this in my couple

186
00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:13.460
of months of working for
Microsoft is that they have

187
00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:17.030
this term coopertition yeah. Where
they're working together, but they

188
00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:19.910
are competing against each other.
Well, we talked about this

189
00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:24.710
on dotnet rocks with Daniel Simmons
in back in April I'll

190
00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:28.700
show 226. And that was
one of my first questions,

191
00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:31.400
which, you know, how, where,
you know, what slots do

192
00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:34.730
these technologies fit in. He
did a really good job

193
00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:36.860
of sort of separating them
out. So I would encourage

194
00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:39.650
people to listen to that.
Yeah. I think that anything

195
00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:41.420
that we can do to
provide a little bit of

196
00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:45.050
elucidation around these things, because
there's all this information that's

197
00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:47.210
coming at you. And then
now the 2008 has just

198
00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:50.000
come out, you're going to
see kind of the next,

199
00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:54.320
the 0.5 wave I call
this. This is kind of

200
00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.780
like, you know, a new
version of something comes out

201
00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:59.330
and then all the power
packs and the ad-ons and

202
00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:03.410
the things that are tweaks
and little modifications to that

203
00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:05.750
new release thing will come
out. It's kind of a

204
00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:08.720
sign wave that happens with
Microsoft, you know, 2005 came

205
00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:11.840
out visual studio, and then
there were all these kind

206
00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:15.050
of additions and the Ajax
framework, you know, Atlas and

207
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:19.640
ad-ons the web project add
on. I think we'll see

208
00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:23.420
the same thing with 2008
where after 2008 comes out,

209
00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:27.860
of course, we're going to
see the asp.net 3.5 extensions,

210
00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:31.610
which will include MVC. They'll
include the new dynamic data

211
00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:35.930
stuff. People might feel that
this is kind of an

212
00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:39.950
overwhelming crush of, of stuff
coming in from Microsoft. And,

213
00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:42.230
you know, can I just
stop for a month and

214
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:44.120
release nothing so that we
can just kind of soak

215
00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:47.390
it in, but they're, they
are trying to move the

216
00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:49.880
ball forward. Although they are,
in fact, there's so many

217
00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:51.800
people at Microsoft that they're
kind of competing against each

218
00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:54.370
other. I think this will
be the year that we'll

219
00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:56.860
figure this stuff out. Oh
yeah, totally. Yeah. But this

220
00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:58.030
will be the year that
we start to get our

221
00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:01.150
brain around that. I remember
when.net first came out, that

222
00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:03.430
I was just completely overwhelmed.
And I was like, Oh

223
00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:04.510
my God, I'm going to
have to. And they kept

224
00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:06.550
stressing how many methods there
were. I remember you'd go

225
00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:10.810
and see a.net, a.net presentation.
Well, here's how reflection works.

226
00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.460
I'll do a little thing
to find out how many

227
00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:16.240
methods there are on the.net
framework. Oh, there's 280,000 good

228
00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:19.230
luck. They kept stressing how
big it is. Right. Came

229
00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:21.240
out. It grew by a
factor of like five or

230
00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.070
something. Yeah. And then with
three, you know, it's like,

231
00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:24.960
there's, there's definitely more than
you can handle. And this

232
00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:27.060
is why I think there's,
this is the year of

233
00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:29.460
the leaky abstraction. We're going
to start seeing abstraction layers

234
00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:32.550
to make things simpler. You
know, MVC has a lot

235
00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:35.780
sitting underneath it, but ultimately
the abstraction that you talked

236
00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:38.610
to is simpler. All right.
Well, Getting off the developer

237
00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:43.380
thing, now let's talk about
apps, applications that came out.

238
00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.020
I guess this is sort
of the year of the

239
00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:49.440
Ajax web application. The, you
know, it's an it's shining

240
00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:53.460
glory. There have been some
apps coming out this year

241
00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:56.040
that have completely blown my
mind in the sense of,

242
00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:00.090
I think we asked ourselves
last year, could an application

243
00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:02.130
come out where it would
be so nice in the

244
00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:04.620
browser and so fast and
so clean that I wouldn't

245
00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:08.760
miss. I wouldn't wish it
was a fat client. Right?

246
00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:10.580
Cause there was a time
in the, or in the

247
00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:13.290
beginning of 2007, when an
application would come out and

248
00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:14.670
I go, well, this would
be great. It's a smart

249
00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:17.730
client. Right? And then they
got better and they got

250
00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:20.310
better. They got better. The,
an app that I'm completely

251
00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:24.330
enamored with right now is
mint.com mint, gotta check this

252
00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:27.450
out. mint.com. This is the
kind of the closest thing

253
00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:30.450
to Microsoft money or Quicken
in the browser that I've

254
00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:35.220
seen last year. I was
really into wasabi with sabi.com,

255
00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:39.900
which is an online money
manager application, mint.com has a

256
00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:42.870
little bit different perspective in
wasabi. You upload your data

257
00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:45.060
from your desktop. So you
basically run an application in

258
00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:47.460
the tray and you upload
your data with mint. You

259
00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:49.080
have to trust them a
lot more. You actually have

260
00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:52.350
to give them your bank
login information. But if you

261
00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:55.740
can get past that trusting
issue, they'll automatically download your

262
00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:58.680
transactions. They'll make charts and
graphs. They'll send you events

263
00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:02.310
like low balances. And one
of the things that's cool

264
00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:04.950
is that if they get
a complete perspective of your,

265
00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:08.880
your money, they will offer
you things like, you know,

266
00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:11.100
your visa is at 7%.
And if you switch over

267
00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:13.560
to this visa, you can
get 4%. So they have

268
00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:16.860
that kind of holistic view.
And the entire thing is

269
00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:20.640
Ajax. It's clean, it's crisp.
And that's why it's free

270
00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:23.430
because they, they try to
sell you financial services. Oh

271
00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:26.160
yeah. Their business model is
clear. They're there. Their partners

272
00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:29.670
are basically involved in the
financial services. Right. But the,

273
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.220
the thing that I think
is significant is that mint

274
00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:37.770
is representative of people who
aren't Gmail understanding Ajax. Yeah.

275
00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:40.170
So say that again. I
mean, Gmail was like the

276
00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:43.080
Ajax app in the year
of Ajax and I think

277
00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:47.040
mint and applications like it
are really pointing out that

278
00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:51.230
other people can make really
full featured applications that they

279
00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:54.260
use Egypt like Zoho. If
you've seen the Zoho suite,

280
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:57.800
no, I have to Z
O H o.com. These guys

281
00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:00.980
are basically kind of nipping
at the heels of Google

282
00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:06.440
docs, spreadsheets, presentations, documents, you
know, it's my Microsoft money

283
00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:10.310
in the, in the browser.
Wow. People are definitely watching

284
00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:14.480
Zoho, all Ajax all the
time, crazy stuff. Well, even

285
00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:16.520
Gmail this year came up
with a pile of new

286
00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:20.540
updates. We saw <inaudible> support
for g-mail, which was huge.

287
00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:23.720
Is Zoho free. Also though,
has it, they have a

288
00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:26.000
free version and they have
a, a pay subscription version.

289
00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:29.690
Okay. And now Gmail came
up with IMAT access, which

290
00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:32.600
was massive. I stopped using
pop to talk to my

291
00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:36.140
Gmail. Right. They came in
with support to talk to

292
00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:40.580
'em AOL instant messenger from
Gmail talk. They've got a

293
00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:44.480
contact. I finally a contact
manager it's gotten faster. And

294
00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.010
then all the new stuff,
if you've seen it in

295
00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:49.550
Google maps, local now has
this Google maps my location.

296
00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:51.710
So if you take your,
yeah, if you take your,

297
00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:56.570
your phone and you go
to google.com/g M M Google

298
00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:59.480
mobile maps, they've got this
feature called my location where

299
00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:02.360
they basically kind of a
poor man's GPS. They figure

300
00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:06.170
out where you're located based
on what cell tower you're

301
00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:10.030
talking to. Well, you know,
some phones have GPS built

302
00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:13.450
in and their software doesn't
utilize it. So I know

303
00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:16.750
windows mobile five, I believe
it was the first windows

304
00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:20.650
op operating system to, to,
to, to give you the

305
00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:23.650
API APIs to it. Right.
And, but I guess the,

306
00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:25.720
the problem with GPS on
a phone is just the

307
00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:27.970
amount of memory it takes
to have those maps in

308
00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:30.460
there. Huh? Well, with Google
maps, of course they're streaming

309
00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:33.190
those maps down as you,
as you move. So the

310
00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:34.990
amount of memory that it
uses is very small because

311
00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:37.450
it's throwing the maps out
that you can't see. Right.

312
00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:40.240
And it'll allow you, if
you have a GPS in

313
00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:42.700
your phone as hardware and
you don't have an application

314
00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:44.980
to use it, you know,
Google maps will let you

315
00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:48.100
do that. You have access
that really plug Google maps.

316
00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:50.740
So work with the GPS
in your phone. Yep. Absolutely.

317
00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:52.540
So if you have a
GPS or you have an

318
00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:54.910
external one, you can plug
it into the port, it'll

319
00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:57.010
use the GPS that's in
your phone, or you can

320
00:16:57.010 --> 00:17:00.430
use the poor man's version
of my location where it'll

321
00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:02.380
use your cell tower to
figure out. I didn't know

322
00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:05.740
that. Yeah. We gotta to
talk more Scott. Okay. We

323
00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:08.380
should, we should actually. Yeah.
All right. Let's move on

324
00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:11.740
to games. Yeah. You know,
this was the year for

325
00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:16.480
games. I mean, I'm not
a huge gamer. Like I'll

326
00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:19.390
play a game about halfway
through and then I'll say,

327
00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:22.030
wow, that was a really
satisfying experience. I get it.

328
00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:26.080
And then once I realized
that I'm personally not playing

329
00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:28.750
the game anymore, it's just
me versus the developer. That's

330
00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:30.670
when the game kind of
like loses its luster for

331
00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:34.000
me. Right. But man, 2007,
I mean, what games came

332
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.070
out this year that just
completely blew my mind. I

333
00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:39.670
mean, call of duty four
was about the closest thing

334
00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:42.130
to playing a movie that
I'd ever seen. Halo three

335
00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:46.840
halo three came out. Not,
not the standout for me

336
00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:49.380
this year, actually. Yeah. I
would say I would play

337
00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:52.320
call of duty four over
halo three. Another game I've

338
00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:55.110
been playing is called mass
effect, which is about the

339
00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:57.630
closest thing to playing a
science fiction book that I've

340
00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:01.020
ever seen. People. People think
it's a, a shooter. It's

341
00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:03.990
not, it's absolutely an RPG.
It's a role playing game

342
00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:08.790
with something like 270,000 lines
of dialogue. It's got actors

343
00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:11.250
that you recognize like Seth
green, who are doing the

344
00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:15.030
dialogue. You can make the
person, your main character look

345
00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:17.760
like you, if you want
to by modifying their face.

346
00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:20.940
And then they, Oh, it's
just amazing. There's like 150

347
00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:24.330
hours of content in this
amazing game called mass effects.

348
00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:26.640
A little scary. Well, and
then when are you gonna

349
00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:28.800
find 150 hours? I mean,
once you have family and

350
00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:30.450
the only time that I
get this, as you know,

351
00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:34.470
between 1145 and 12 at
night is the only time

352
00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:37.020
I get a chance, but
still games like that. Absolutely

353
00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:41.580
amazing. The, you know, of
course Bioshock was unreal. I

354
00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:44.370
recommend Bioshock. These are all
in one year. I mean,

355
00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:46.770
you, you would hope for
a year with one good

356
00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:49.440
game like this. And we
had like six. Yeah. And

357
00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:52.740
actually I finally found another
game for my, we, you

358
00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:54.690
know, I've got the, the
Nintendo, we, I know you

359
00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:57.840
guys have got it as
well. The wife loves playing

360
00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:00.420
tennis, but I felt like
for the last year I

361
00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:05.010
bought this $250 tennis simulator,
you know, when's my next

362
00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:06.420
game going to come out.
When's my, you know, what

363
00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:09.900
else can I play? When's
a more advanced tennis game.

364
00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:13.680
But then Metroid came out
and Metro I'm playing Metroid,

365
00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:20.490
Metroid, Metroid, Metroid met R
O D Metroid corruption. And

366
00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:23.820
it is a first person
shooter, but it doesn't use

367
00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:27.600
a controller like a, like
you would inhaler your, your

368
00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:30.720
character. Sam has, has this
arm with a gun on

369
00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:34.500
it. And that is your,
your, we control our hand

370
00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:36.840
and then you use the
nunchuck to move around. And

371
00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:39.090
it's kind of the most
innovative way to move around

372
00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:41.550
a first person shooter that
I've, that I've ever seen.

373
00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:44.160
And it's, it really has
made the, we have very

374
00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:46.350
serious. I mean, it's not
just the game for we

375
00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:48.990
sports plus Mario. I mean,
it there's more to the

376
00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:52.370
weed than that. And I
think that seeing, I always

377
00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:55.550
thought that it was revolutionary
in that the low hanging

378
00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:59.030
fruit was the sports, but
that it really opens up

379
00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:02.900
the doors for game makers
to be creative with what

380
00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:07.610
they can do with this
controller. And no, I don't

381
00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:10.610
think it's just the $250
tennis simulators. It's just because

382
00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:13.130
the games aren't out there
yet. Well, But the question

383
00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:15.590
is, are they, are they
making better games? I mean,

384
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:19.730
the hardware is unreal. If
you, if you look for,

385
00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:22.970
I think his name is
Johnny Chung, Lee Google for

386
00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:28.100
Johnny Chung Lee. And this
is a guy who basically

387
00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:30.890
he's got a website, so
Trisha, Johnny Chung, and then

388
00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:33.680
the we, and he is
basically taking apart the we

389
00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:37.220
and making something interesting every
week with it. And using

390
00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:42.320
the we moat, that's called
the remote remote C-sharp library

391
00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:46.250
from the coding for fun
guys, Johnny Chung has created

392
00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:50.710
a finger tracking. He's got
an application with free source

393
00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:55.390
code for a low cost
multipoint interactive whiteboard using the,

394
00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:58.390
we, he's got a really
amazing video. You've got to

395
00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:02.170
see about head tracking. So
you're basically making it desktop

396
00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:06.280
three-dimensional virtual reality display by
putting a pair of glasses

397
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:10.660
on your head. Wow. That
has a little IRR emitter

398
00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:14.860
that pretends to be the
IRR bar and then talk

399
00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:17.860
to the remote. He's got
the library, he's got the

400
00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:21.720
program in C-sharp And I
like the finger tracking thing.

401
00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:24.930
So he's got like a
says using an led array

402
00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:27.330
and some reflective tape. You
can use the infrared camera

403
00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:30.570
in the we remote to
track objects, like your fingers

404
00:21:30.570 --> 00:21:33.330
into D space. This lets
you interact with your computer

405
00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:36.000
simply by waving your hands
in the air, similar to

406
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:41.030
the interaction scene in the
movie minority report. Yeah. And

407
00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:43.170
these are things you can
do yourself. You can play

408
00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:45.270
with this. The thing that
people don't realize about the,

409
00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:47.160
we, it is all written
in C sharp. I think

410
00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:49.230
people don't realize about the,
we is that it's the

411
00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:52.260
hardware built into the we
mode that has actually an

412
00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:57.000
infrared camera with built in
hardware blob tracking of up

413
00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.160
to four different points at
a hundred Hertz. So you

414
00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:01.680
think about that in terms
of what can a web

415
00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:04.560
cam do? Oh wow. I'm
talking about 1,024 by seven

416
00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:07.920
68 IRR camera that does
this tr this blob tracking

417
00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:11.070
and hardware. That's so awesome.
People need to pay attention

418
00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:13.050
to this guy and start
writing some games, but I

419
00:22:13.050 --> 00:22:14.760
don't know if the games
are being developed, but the

420
00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:18.920
potential for the wee hardware
is just it's obscene. It's,

421
00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:21.840
it's fantastic. So I'm really
excited about that. There's actually

422
00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:23.460
another thing that's coming out
for the we this year

423
00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:26.600
called the, we fit that
is going to be a,

424
00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:29.790
a pad that you stand
on a, like a rigid

425
00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:33.210
pad, not a soft pad,
like dance, dance revolution that

426
00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:36.750
will be able to detect
the, the pressure on the

427
00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:38.850
bottom of your feet. So
then you can do yoga

428
00:22:39.210 --> 00:22:42.540
and it will tell you
interesting. It knows whether you're

429
00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:44.760
balanced or not. And then
it comes with a yoga

430
00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:48.120
application. So I think the
potential for exercise applications that

431
00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:49.860
will now be able to
detect your feet, as well

432
00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:52.890
as your, your, your hands
using the remote. Alright, so

433
00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:56.190
Let's, let's look forward to
2008 and you know, I

434
00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:58.260
know that you, now that
you work for the man,

435
00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:01.110
you know, you have privy,
you're privy to insight information,

436
00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:02.820
and we don't want you
to divulge anything that you

437
00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:06.750
can't divulge, but you must
be seeing some trends happening

438
00:23:06.810 --> 00:23:11.850
in technology, not for, just
for developers, but for applications

439
00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:16.320
and for games and, you
know, give us, Well, these

440
00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:18.630
are just personal predictions then.
So let's just talk about

441
00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:23.250
some ideas. I think that
if you've seen Google gears,

442
00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:27.240
of course, right, Google gears
gives you, you know, persistence

443
00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:29.610
within the browser. I think
this'll be the year where

444
00:23:29.610 --> 00:23:32.970
that gets figured out, where
we're going to get local

445
00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:35.820
persistent storage in the browser.
It may not necessarily be

446
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.180
clean, like built into the
browser. But I think that

447
00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:43.620
if Firefox three builds Google
gear support in a, or

448
00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:47.420
if people start building a
cleaner around the isolated storage

449
00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:51.620
things inside of Silverlight such
that we can use that,

450
00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:54.920
that storage in lieu of
cookies. I think that's going

451
00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:56.900
to take the web to
a new, a new level.

452
00:23:56.930 --> 00:24:00.650
We'll see things like Gmail
have Google gears support. We've

453
00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:04.040
already seen Google reader built
in support for gears. So

454
00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:07.910
the idea that the offline
web may happen. So all

455
00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:12.500
this time, while we've been
waiting for, for smart clients

456
00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:16.100
to, to support things like
offline, I think that Ajax

457
00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:19.160
is going to actually catch
up and lap them. It's

458
00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:21.380
going to get done faster.
One of the great things

459
00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:23.510
about the browser is that
the data isn't on the

460
00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:26.780
client. So what are the
kinds of applications that you

461
00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:30.590
see where there's a local
database that the browser can

462
00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:34.580
access? Well, well, just like
outlook gained greatly when it

463
00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:37.760
had offline support. When you
could fire up outlook on

464
00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:41.120
an airplane, put a bunch
of emails in your outbox

465
00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:44.360
and then sync. When you
got back down, there are

466
00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:48.050
applications that will, that will
provide value if they have

467
00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:51.650
that ability. So whether you've
got calendaring or inbox things,

468
00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:56.480
money management, RSS, but that
means a lot more client

469
00:24:56.480 --> 00:25:00.350
side code. No, I it's
about a clean abstraction layer.

470
00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:02.420
If you look at the
stuff that Google gears does,

471
00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:04.220
and you think about this
as a kind of a,

472
00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:06.620
of a right through cash,
you will be able to

473
00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:09.860
make data access layers in
JavaScript. That will basically say,

474
00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:12.500
give me this thing. I
don't care whether it's coming

475
00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:14.570
from the internet or whether
it's coming from local storage,

476
00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:17.570
it'll keep track of freshness.
Well, and that plays well

477
00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:20.000
with silver light to Oh,
as well, doesn't it? Because

478
00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:22.790
a silver light to O
app. Yes. It's delivered with

479
00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:26.810
the browser, but it's really
rich. It's got rich client

480
00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:29.420
support. Yeah. And that's one
of the things I think

481
00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:32.270
that silver light or flash
will offer that a pure

482
00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:36.080
Ajax application doesn't is that
with, with those applications, the

483
00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:39.230
code is down. It's pretty
much handled with Ajax. If

484
00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:41.450
you look at how to
write Ajax code against Google

485
00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:43.850
gears, now your Ajax application,
if it's going to work

486
00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:47.060
offline has to really think
about what part of me

487
00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:50.660
is in memory. Yeah. What's
cached. What's not going to

488
00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:53.390
be careful to go and,
you know, call for things

489
00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:55.760
that aren't available yet. Whether
those things be images or

490
00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:58.340
other resources. So it's going
to be an interesting thing,

491
00:25:58.340 --> 00:25:59.930
but this is definitely, I
think the year of the

492
00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:03.200
offline web. Very good. What
we'll see if any of

493
00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:06.420
those predictions come true. And
I, you know, I, I

494
00:26:06.450 --> 00:26:09.020
I'm with you. I think,
I think you're absolutely right

495
00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:12.110
about those trends. I hope
so. We'll say if I'm

496
00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:14.570
not, then we'll make up
something else next year at

497
00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:20.120
the 2008 wrap-up all right,
Scott. Thanks very much. And

498
00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:22.310
we'll see you next time
on Hansel minutes.
