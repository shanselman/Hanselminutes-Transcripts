pairing and the user connection.
Hi, this is Scott Hanselman.

10
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.130
This is another episode of
Hansel minutes. And today I've

11
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:06.800
got Leon Gursing on the
phone late at night in

12
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.390
somewhere in Ohio, in Ohio,
somewhere. Right? Glows Columbus. You

13
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.130
aren't closed. So you actually
live in Columbus. I'm in

14
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.110
the bus, you're in the
bus. Excellent. And you are

15
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.490
the Ruby Buddha. Yeah. That
is a really great Twitter

16
00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:28.040
name. It has the many
as is it has a

17
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.450
storied history, but yeah. Yeah.
I have to give credit

18
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.250
to Jerry knew me, my
business partner. He actually coined

19
00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.740
it. Yeah. And is that
like your brand? Is it

20
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.120
like, even like, oh.com.org.net dot.dot
X-Box or whatever. All the

21
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:50.780
new domains it's just Twitter.
It's just Twitter, that's it?

22
00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.830
So you, and I've actually
spoken at two different conferences

23
00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.840
together without even realizing it.
Even though we run in

24
00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.940
different circles and a couple
of people commented that one

25
00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.340
thing that we're both known
for, and I think it's

26
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.280
good to be known for.
This is being a generally

27
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.960
pleasant and pretty agreeable and
very nice online. I don't

28
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.530
think that you've said anything
mean ever. You're pretty chill

29
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.790
and that's not really common,
like on the internet, regardless

30
00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.580
of community, regardless of language,
regardless of what people say

31
00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.530
about any community, it's just
so uncommon to find someone

32
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.470
being consistently nice for more
than a few months at

33
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.530
a time. But, but is
that something that you're, are

34
00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.320
you like, are you mean
when like the microphone is

35
00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.750
off and the Twitter handle
is not turned on or

36
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.270
are you always nice? Oh
no. I, I turned into

37
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.920
a demon. The gloves come
off. I just started F

38
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:52.550
bombing everywhere I go. No
inappropriate dancing girls and swearing.

39
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.450
Just exactly. It's like an
old timey, like a, you

40
00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.930
know, fifties weird kind sexual
Novella come to life. We

41
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.010
are the very worst of
mad men. Yes, absolutely. No,

42
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.990
I don't. I, I, I
don't particularly like the term

43
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:18.040
nice because I wouldn't, I
don't, I, I don't, I

44
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.080
guess I don't identify with
the term. Nice. Aye. Aye,

45
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:30.940
aye. Look to be empathetic
because to me over time.

46
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.590
So I mean early, early
on in my career too,

47
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.130
for like 10, 15 years
ago, you know, you have

48
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.930
a lot of <inaudible> and
then you can get caught

49
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.450
up in, in that same
kind of weird battle. And

50
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.790
I was, I was caught
up in it for a

51
00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.470
while and I kind of
looked around and I was

52
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.150
like, man, I, I'm not
angry. Like why, why does,

53
00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.970
why is everybody angry? And
it took a minute to

54
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.690
just turn it on it's
a year. And just think

55
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:11.080
about that question. Like why,
why has everyone around me

56
00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:18.280
so frustrated, so angry, so
afraid. And so it just

57
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.530
kind of switched not to
necessarily being nice, but to

58
00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:29.140
being, to showing more empathy
and to listening more, I

59
00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.680
think the reason that folks
tend to get riled up

60
00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.880
is because they're essentially shouting
into a vacuum. And what

61
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.590
they're wanting is to be
validated that what they have

62
00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:48.010
to say is important and
that somebody is interested. And

63
00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.800
if you keep repeating yourself
over and over again and

64
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.010
has never sounded back, no
one says, I hear you.

65
00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.620
I understand you. Then it's
easy to suddenly turn inward

66
00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.150
and think well is what
I have to say real.

67
00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.090
And I think that fear
kind of turns into this

68
00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:15.210
vitreal that we see on
the web. I had a

69
00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:21.690
conversation with commander taco from
slash dot and a kind

70
00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.500
of original Braithwaite. One of
my was a fan. I

71
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.980
am a huge fan of
his Canada, Reagan Wald and

72
00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.230
Reagan wall is always on
hacker news. That's effectively the

73
00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.690
commenting system for his blog
because everything he writes is

74
00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:35.670
gold and then it ends
up on hacker news. And

75
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:37.620
then that's where the comments
come in. And the co

76
00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.620
the discussion I had with,
with commander taco, Rob Malda

77
00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:45.270
and, and reg was about
criticism. And in both instances,

78
00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.570
you know, those are two
communities that are known for

79
00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:51.960
just a level of, of
bile that is really quite

80
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.630
amazing. And you, you find
yourself reading and wondering, like,

81
00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:57.320
what must be going on
at this guy's job or

82
00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.200
this girl's company that would
cause them to be so

83
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:06.520
mean to Other you. Yeah.
And it's like, and it's

84
00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.950
funny that you mentioned human
beings because the last three

85
00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:12.070
comments that I've left on
slash dot were basically, Hey,

86
00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:15.370
on a person here. No,
I hadn't. I hadn't. I

87
00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:18.010
had nothing else to say
other than hi. Just wanted

88
00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:20.980
to let you know, I
can hear you. Okay. Oh

89
00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:26.680
yes. I completely understand. Most
times I just simply respond

90
00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:32.230
back. If I'm, you know,
being baited, I just respond

91
00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:34.390
back. I mean, if your
intent was to hurt my

92
00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:38.830
feelings, then you've succeeded. If
you have a valid point,

93
00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:43.810
I'm willing to listen and
engage. Cause that's really the

94
00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:49.330
truth. The truth is that
someone who's leading with anger

95
00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:53.470
is not being heard. If
you're being heard and you

96
00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:57.490
feel like you're being heard
and understood, it's very difficult

97
00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:03.910
to suddenly just react knee-jerk
in anger. If you give

98
00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:08.530
that, you'll get it back.
And that's that, that's all

99
00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:11.830
I'm trying to do ever.
It could because, because being

100
00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:14.110
nice just for the sake
of being nice, just for

101
00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:18.880
being pleasant for me, at
least the way that those

102
00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:23.830
terms sit in my psyche,
there's, there's a, there's a

103
00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:29.440
certain level. There's a veneer
on those terms of falseness

104
00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:34.480
or, you know, it's almost
like you can, the notion

105
00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:39.280
of somebody like, like, like
smiling through their anger. I

106
00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:42.790
don't want that. Cause that's
nothing, you're not showing me

107
00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:45.610
anything about who you are.
If you're angry and you're

108
00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:51.250
legitimately angry, I will see
it turn to something else.

109
00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:55.660
Usually that anger falls away
really quickly in the face

110
00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:58.700
of empathy. Yeah. It's funny
how, you know, it's, it's,

111
00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:01.950
it's very Yoda, but the
whole anger, you know, fear

112
00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.960
begets anger is really true.
I mean, ultimately there's fear

113
00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:09.550
underneath that in some way.
Absolutely. Well, I mean, I

114
00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:12.160
think you even said it
on Twitter today, which kind

115
00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:16.600
of launched this thing, which
was the hugs or something,

116
00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.970
you know, you threw hugs
in there after like a

117
00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:22.300
comment or something. And I
went, yes, that's it right

118
00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:25.270
there because it's really, that's
all we all. Yeah. Well,

119
00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:28.270
I, I posted something just
kind of random and silly

120
00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:32.410
and inflammatory noninflammatory. I just
made some silly posts a

121
00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:35.320
couple of days ago about
visual basic six and Ruby.

122
00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:38.410
And the point wasn't that
they're the same. It was

123
00:08:38.410 --> 00:08:41.890
just like, Oh, well I'm
still doing record sets and

124
00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:44.860
things, you know what I
mean, 20 years ago, you

125
00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:48.700
know, well, this is just
to I'm stupid or for

126
00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:51.520
having, Oh, you know, like
people, like you said, someone

127
00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.250
sent me an invoice for
their time. Like I need

128
00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:56.460
those 10 minutes back, you
know, here's the invoice like

129
00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:59.880
re really, I mean, just
kind of being a silly

130
00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:03.330
guy. So then I said,
you know, I was rocking

131
00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:06.390
the world in VB three,
20 years ago. I was

132
00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:09.150
seriously crushing it. And it
was maybe three. And I'm

133
00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:11.340
okay with that. It was
20 years ago, you know,

134
00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:15.710
you are named textual person.
You were three. Right. You

135
00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:18.170
know what I mean? You
were Potty training and I

136
00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:20.450
was crushing it. So I'm
old and I get to

137
00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:23.060
be old now. So I'm
going to sit back here

138
00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:25.670
and be old. Okay. I'm
gonna be old and enjoy

139
00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:29.180
my vantage point. I just
don't know what that there

140
00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:31.460
is, there is nothing. And
you earn that. That's, you

141
00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:35.540
know, that's perfect. Wonderful. Just
for sticking around. And then

142
00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:37.550
the one guy was like,
I hate all languages. And

143
00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:41.090
I was like, okay, let's
hug it out. I hate

144
00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:44.210
that. That was right, Jay.
Right. That was pretty awesome.

145
00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.450
The Jay's beautiful. Right? J
J is from Michigan and

146
00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:50.750
he's incredibly smart and really,
really talented. It was a

147
00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:53.110
funny comment. And he had
this great comment, but, but

148
00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.280
that's something that he and
I talk about a lot.

149
00:09:55.310 --> 00:10:00.380
It's just, you'll have a
contrarian viewpoint of maybe something

150
00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:03.680
that's in the dominant culture
at the moment. And I'm

151
00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:07.340
like, well, that's not negative.
It's not, it's not negative

152
00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:12.560
to have experience that you've
actually gained wisdom from and

153
00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.770
then turn around and share
it. Yeah, yeah. No matter

154
00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:18.140
what it was when, no
matter what you're doing. Absolutely.

155
00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:23.300
That's fine. It's negative. When
you have no concept, when

156
00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:25.430
you have no idea what
you're talking about when you

157
00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:29.900
were simply cargo, culting something
that you've heard over and

158
00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:34.460
over again, just so that
you can be given a

159
00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:38.210
seat at some fictional table
that simply does not exist.

160
00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:42.530
Yeah. And it's important to
remember how small our little

161
00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:45.710
echo chamber really is, you
know? Oh yeah, yeah. I

162
00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:47.510
mean, someone's like, Oh, you
have so many thousands of

163
00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:50.060
followers. And it's like, you
know, but there's like 8 billion

164
00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:53.630
people or something. I mean,
that's pretty small. It's like,

165
00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:56.630
not even a village, you
know what I mean? Like,

166
00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:58.940
Oh my God, Hanselman, you've
got 50,000 followers. Okay. So

167
00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:04.190
that's like a suburb of
a small Midwestern town. And

168
00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:09.020
most of them are probably
bots. At least 40,000 of

169
00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:11.360
them are bots. You know
what I mean? It's like,

170
00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:14.270
it's like that episode of
stuff, star Trek, when Kirk

171
00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:15.950
and Spock try to take
over that planet. That's full

172
00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:18.470
of mobsters and somewhere in
the middle of the show,

173
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:20.930
one of them mobsters like,
wait a second. I've only

174
00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:24.950
ever seen YouTube and cursing.
No, no, no. There's like

175
00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:28.700
400 guys up there. I
don't think so. I'm pretty

176
00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:31.850
sure it's just you guys
in a phaser. That's how

177
00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:34.220
I feel on Twitter. Sometimes.
Like the same six guys,

178
00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.230
this guy is, you know,
he has a mr. Burns

179
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:39.530
avatar and then there's the
other guy and everyone else

180
00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:42.620
has a bot, but I
like what you said about

181
00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:44.840
you're right. I've been using
the word nice and kind.

182
00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:47.630
I always use the word
kind. I started this pain

183
00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:51.470
with kindness. Empathy is that
we nailed it with empathy,

184
00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:53.800
empathy, because I started this
meme a while back called

185
00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:57.010
don't give bile a permalink.
Like if you're going to

186
00:11:57.010 --> 00:11:59.410
be awful, it'd be just
do it. You know, like

187
00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:02.020
at a Bennigan's or a
bar somewhere where no one's

188
00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:04.660
recording it, but for goodness
sake, don't give it a

189
00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:08.190
permalink and then make it
Google-able. And ah, yeah. You

190
00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:11.850
know, is come back to
your history. I mean, the,

191
00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:17.580
I think the difference between
the, the text based person

192
00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:22.290
that you're talking about and
someone like you, or to

193
00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:26.580
a lesser extent me is
that we're visible not only

194
00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:30.240
online, but we're visible in
person. Like for, for me

195
00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:35.880
this, then we were talking
about this offline. I, I

196
00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:40.920
speak regionally a lot. And
the reason I do regionally

197
00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:45.720
is because I it's really
one purpose it's I, I

198
00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:48.360
have to pay a tax,
which is talk for an

199
00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:54.450
hour and I get to
meet hundreds of developers. And

200
00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:57.120
most of the time I
get to pair with them.

201
00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:02.400
So I get to go
see people and interact with

202
00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:06.480
them, understand them, see what
they're interested in, share my

203
00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:12.000
stories here. Their, if you
know a face and it's

204
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.900
not an avatar, it's not
mr. Burns. It's that guy

205
00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:18.360
who came over and wanted
to just simply go have

206
00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:21.990
lunch and was genuinely interested
in what you were doing.

207
00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:28.050
It's hard to be mad.
That's I think really the

208
00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:31.440
difference is that people are
not necessarily engaging on a

209
00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:34.350
more personal level. So it's
easy to just simply throw

210
00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:36.540
stones. That is, you know,
that is really true. I

211
00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:39.000
mean, it's something I I'm
realizing that I've always thought

212
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.880
about subconsciously, but I've never
brought it to the forefront.

213
00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:47.850
I mean, there's certain snarky
text people with a Twitter

214
00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:51.450
egg as their avatar or
a cartoon character or some

215
00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:54.840
animated GIF who all say
something and then they always

216
00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:56.850
come with the snark. I
don't know if it's a

217
00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:58.650
man or a woman. I
don't know if they're English

218
00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:01.590
or Scottish or Indian. I
know nothing about them other

219
00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:06.300
than they're mean, or they're
snarky on text. But if

220
00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:08.670
I've met somebody and I
see that they're they have,

221
00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:11.010
they're real people and they
have a, well, even if

222
00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:15.420
that's a pseudonym, even if
it's consistently a cartoon avatar

223
00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:18.570
of someone from second life,
at least it's like humanoid

224
00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:21.690
and, and something I can
somehow relate to. And then

225
00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:23.790
they talk about their lives.
You know, it's funny when

226
00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:25.770
people announce that they're going
to unfollow you on Twitter,

227
00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:28.050
it's like, Oh, there's not
enough tech, not enough meat.

228
00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:30.390
That's fine. Wow. I don't,
you know, I have other

229
00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:32.490
things I'd like to do
like gardening. You don't want

230
00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:36.330
my gardening tweets, you know,
but I love that because

231
00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:38.190
it's like follow the whole
person. I want to know

232
00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:40.350
that you're a human and
you do you dig other

233
00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:43.680
stuff? Absolutely. Well, if that's
the only thing that's important,

234
00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:48.480
the motivation is, is important.
Do the reason you choose

235
00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:51.440
a language, the reason that
you choose a community reason,

236
00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:55.310
you choose a job it's
for its people. It is

237
00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:58.670
never those underlying things. Those
are the things that people

238
00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:02.390
point to me because they're
easy to quantify. I took

239
00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:04.400
that job because of more
money. I took that job

240
00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:08.270
because of X, Y, and
Z. Those are check boxes

241
00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:12.380
that you can use in
Pippie conversations to a search

242
00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:17.630
state, like where you are
in a hierarchical system. But

243
00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:21.260
really when you take the
job you want, when you

244
00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:24.110
find the job you love
or find somebody who says,

245
00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:25.640
you know what, I'm really
doing, what I want to

246
00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:28.400
be doing right now, and
then ask them to talk

247
00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:31.220
about it within 10 seconds.
You're going to hear about

248
00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:35.420
Joe and Ken and Scott
and Matt. And you know

249
00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:36.590
what I mean? They're going
to, they're just going to

250
00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:40.130
laundry list, all of the
great people that they're dealing

251
00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:42.880
with and all of the
lessons they're learning and all

252
00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:46.010
the advances that they're having
in their lives, all the

253
00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:51.800
wisdom they're acquiring. That's, that's
amazing. And that's important. And

254
00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:57.290
that's just infinitely more motivational
than some new title that

255
00:15:57.290 --> 00:16:00.200
somebody got. Nobody cares about
that. They say they do,

256
00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:06.620
but that's, that's, that's backyard
barbecue fodder. That's not, that's

257
00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:11.060
not what you, you're not
resting on your death bed

258
00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:15.410
thinking. Yeah, we're at, when
I turned 35 and you

259
00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:19.100
know, became check lead. That
was the thing. No, it

260
00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:22.310
was when I wrote that
code, we had that all

261
00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:26.390
my bug squash session and
three new features fell out

262
00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:28.520
of it and people loved
it. And we all had

263
00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:34.120
a great time. It's a
different thing. That's funny. The,

264
00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:37.960
one of the best memories
I have was about 15

265
00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:41.200
years ago, we were working
as it is now 2002,

266
00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:47.830
15 years ago, we were
2012, 15 years ago. And

267
00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:51.010
we were doing a website
called gear.com. And we were

268
00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:53.560
using this amazing new technology
called XML. And we were

269
00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:56.710
using it. We were using
it for everything. And I

270
00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:59.110
honestly couldn't tell you anything
other than that, that project,

271
00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:01.390
other than we use XML.
But I could tell you,

272
00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:05.590
we had four people working
all summer long, like the

273
00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:08.320
hot summer in a, and
we was the first time

274
00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:09.940
we'd ever taken all our
desks and kind of like

275
00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:12.220
put them in a square.
And we just sat there

276
00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:14.560
and we listened to cake
albums, number, you know, cake.

277
00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:19.690
We listened to cake eight
hours a day for like,

278
00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:21.520
this is a, this is
my memory. Of course, it's

279
00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:23.800
the, it's the kind of
like warped memory of the

280
00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:27.430
summer. It's a beautiful thing,
but that's 40 hours a

281
00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:29.710
week of nothing but cake.
And we would just sing

282
00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:32.470
and dance and write the
stupid website. And in the

283
00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:34.720
end we rocked the website.
I don't even remember. I

284
00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.550
don't even remember, you know,
I'm sure it went live

285
00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:39.700
or whatever at some point,
but you know, I cannot

286
00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:42.400
not think about how awesome
that crew was without, you

287
00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:45.520
know, if I hear cake
anywhere, even like music version

288
00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:48.520
of cake, it's like I
was there. Yeah. And that's

289
00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:52.590
what you'll take. So even
that example that you just

290
00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:56.820
gave, you mentioned XML, a
small joke in XML land

291
00:17:57.090 --> 00:18:02.160
one time rests with everything
else around it. Yes. That's,

292
00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:05.490
what's interesting. I mean, the
rest of this stuff is

293
00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:07.860
just means to an answer.
This is all this technology

294
00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:10.470
that people are fighting over
right now a year from

295
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:12.690
now. It would be something
else 10 years from now

296
00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:15.870
will be something else. It
doesn't matter. That stuff is

297
00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:21.030
cool. It's interesting. It fuels
the conversation, but really what's

298
00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:23.190
at the end of the
day, what people want is

299
00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:25.050
they want to connect. They
want to be social with

300
00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:26.880
each other and they want
to be, and they want

301
00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:29.700
to have that reach and
that impact with their audience,

302
00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:32.640
whatever that audience happens to
be. If you are somebody

303
00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:35.190
who is shipping product, you
want to know that you

304
00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:37.560
want to be as close
to that relationship to the

305
00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:41.610
person that's actually using the
product as humanly possible. The

306
00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:45.030
further away you distance yourself
from that, I think you

307
00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:47.880
will find a strong correlation
with people who are distanced

308
00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:53.510
from many other facets of
their emotional life. I was

309
00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:55.820
at a, a, a customer
site as I get to

310
00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:57.600
visit a lot of customers.
And I was like customer

311
00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:00.020
in a day. And this
was a customer. I was

312
00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:02.930
in business in business for
like 30 years. And some

313
00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:05.030
of these guys had like
grown up there, like that

314
00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:06.560
was their first job, you
know? And they were like

315
00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:09.950
15, 17, 20 years later,
they're still there. And this,

316
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.040
this new guy was talking.
And one of the things

317
00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:14.720
I always talk about when
I'm at the, at the,

318
00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:16.940
at a customer is I,
I asked them who is

319
00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:21.080
your customer? And they would
describe these big multilevel marketing

320
00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:23.450
organizations and these big groups
and whatnot. And I was

321
00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:25.670
like, okay. And explaining the
customer. And they go on

322
00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:28.040
for about 20 minutes. And
then the new guy who'd

323
00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:30.110
been there eight months was
like, no, no. I mean,

324
00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:33.590
it's the mom in Phoenix
who just started her own

325
00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:37.310
website to sell double ended
candles or whatever. I don't

326
00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:40.940
know idea, you know, she's
the customer. And she, you

327
00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:43.220
know, because they have these
system that builds websites like

328
00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:46.700
that. And, and people just
kind of stared at him

329
00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:49.370
and they're like, Oh my,
you know, wow, Whoa. You

330
00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:52.550
know, like you just blew
my mind. Like, so I

331
00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:54.260
said, well, when was the
last time anyone talked to

332
00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:57.860
the customer said, well, we
talked to their account representatives.

333
00:19:57.860 --> 00:20:01.310
And we talked to their
marketing guy at the multinational,

334
00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:03.710
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
But I don't think I've

335
00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:06.110
ever talked to the customer.
And then the guy went

336
00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:09.500
on this amazing soliloquy about,
about the great recession and

337
00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:13.640
enabling the end user and
thinking about, you know, five

338
00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:16.010
extra clicks could be enough
to have her give up

339
00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:19.070
in the creation of her
website, integration of her business.

340
00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:21.740
And then, you know, it
was pretty melodramatic, but man,

341
00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:24.290
it got us like totally
amped about like, who is

342
00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:27.410
this mysterious customer? We must
find them. We must find

343
00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:29.300
them and connect with them
immediately. You know, we saw

344
00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:33.110
dispatch someone to Arizona to
hunt Hunter down. And it

345
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:35.270
was so cool that this
guy had not been there

346
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:39.050
a long time was totally
plugged into who that customer

347
00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:42.560
was. And the old timers
had forgotten sure. Who the

348
00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:45.710
human being was that was
touched by their deployments. Sure.

349
00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:50.140
It happens A lot and
it happens all the time.

350
00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:53.950
Leah, that's the thing that
I think that makes me,

351
00:20:54.400 --> 00:21:00.910
that truly makes me sad
is listening to someone talk

352
00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:05.020
about the project they're working
on with utter contempt and

353
00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:10.060
disdain and say, well, what
are you, why are you

354
00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:13.240
even building it? Like, well,
why, I mean, is there

355
00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:16.090
a point other than to
draw a check? Cause I

356
00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:18.370
guarantee you can get, draw
a check just about anywhere.

357
00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:23.170
Why, why are you even
doing that? Like who's benefiting

358
00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:26.860
from your work. And the
answer is, I don't know

359
00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:30.640
some guy or I don't
know somebody somewhere. I don't

360
00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:36.220
know. So, so do you
see anyone? Do you hear

361
00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:39.520
feedback? Well, you know, the
marketing material comes by and

362
00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:43.330
I see like a quote
from somebody and that's it.

363
00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:46.650
Right, right. The verbatims they
call them. Yeah. All of

364
00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:49.230
that. The, the verbatims that's
like a, this is what

365
00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:51.690
they said verbatim. It's like
really? That's, you know, like

366
00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:56.640
maybe an embedded tweet. It's
ridiculous. Yeah. Yeah. Why do

367
00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.320
you think I visit customers
so much? I mean, it's

368
00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:01.620
like sometimes not very often,
but every once in a

369
00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:03.990
while, some not in my
hierarchy, like not my boss,

370
00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:05.970
my boss's boss, but some
random dude will be like,

371
00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:07.920
you know, so you went
and sat with a customer

372
00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:10.380
for like, you know, eight
hours yesterday. Like yeah. I

373
00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:11.940
mean, I sat with them
at their desk and we

374
00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:14.280
paired. Yeah. I guess that
really what you need to

375
00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:16.080
be doing with your time.
And I'm like, Oh my

376
00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:17.880
goodness. Do you have any
idea of what, what it

377
00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:19.620
means to be a member
of the community? Like I

378
00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:22.200
Skype and pare all day,
you know what I mean?

379
00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:25.890
Yeah. It's like someone actually
was Skyping me yesterday. They're

380
00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:27.060
like, all right, well I'll
just let you go back

381
00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:29.040
to whatever it is you
do. And I'm like, well,

382
00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:30.960
you don't know what it
is, but trust me, I'm

383
00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:34.290
talking to a lot of
people. And it's funny. Sometimes

384
00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:37.110
I make up these archetypes.
I've talked about this a

385
00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:39.300
little bit on the show.
We have these two archetypes

386
00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:41.790
that I always bring up.
The first one is the

387
00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:45.780
chief architect of the Nebraska
department of forestry. I don't

388
00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:47.160
know who that is. And
I don't know if he

389
00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:49.170
exists or not. I assume
that there are no trees.

390
00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:52.050
They're very important, but he
seems important. But he probably

391
00:22:52.050 --> 00:22:55.200
is like doing work and
like access and he can't

392
00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.990
afford our latest product. And
he would really love to

393
00:22:57.990 --> 00:23:00.210
use the new hot stuff,
but he's on access or

394
00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:04.020
whatever. And anytime, you know,
there's something around pricing or

395
00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:06.480
skews. I'm like, dude, what
about this guy? I mean,

396
00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:10.050
it's my way of putting
a face. There's a guy

397
00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:13.140
he's important in Nebraska. And
he does important stuff for

398
00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:17.130
that, but he can't, he's
got these constraints. Are we

399
00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:19.560
going to lock him out
of our product line? If

400
00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:22.680
we do X, Y, Z,
sometimes, sometimes you win. Sometimes

401
00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:24.960
you don't. Yeah. So, so
how often do you win

402
00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:27.780
that argument and how often
do you lose it? If,

403
00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:30.000
if the archetype or the
person, or the story is,

404
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.780
is, is, is, is real,
or is really put together

405
00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:38.820
like convincingly. Sometimes it's an
amalgamation of multiple things. I'll

406
00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:40.550
talk to five or six
people and I'll, I'll, I'll

407
00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:43.500
give real actual stories or
I'll say, well, here's what

408
00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:45.440
I'm hearing from these five
people and I, that they

409
00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:49.310
are representative of a larger
group. Sure. I've talked about

410
00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:53.600
dark. What I call dark
matter developers. We know they

411
00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:56.300
exist. We can't really measure
it, but I know they

412
00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:58.310
make up a large amount
of space and we can't

413
00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:01.010
necessarily see, but I know
in my heart of hearts

414
00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:02.510
that they're there and I'm
still trying to find the

415
00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:08.240
measurement tool, but we can't
forget those guys. And it

416
00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:10.550
works. I mean, if you
can really look someone in

417
00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:12.470
the eye, even at a
giant company like Microsoft and

418
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:15.950
make them understand that there
is a person who is

419
00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:19.670
doing this work, that is
much more convincing than saying,

420
00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:22.280
well, the guys at Dell,
you know what I mean?

421
00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:25.150
Know what I mean? Like
that's so impersonal. That means

422
00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:31.750
nothing. Right? Exactly. That means
nothing. I, I really wish

423
00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:36.520
the folks would listen to
the words that come out

424
00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:40.690
of their mouth and that
we would collectively look them

425
00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:44.230
back in the eye and
just call them on that.

426
00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:48.790
Not in a mean way,
but if somebody says, well,

427
00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:52.540
X from Dell, or like
10 levels deep of, of

428
00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:56.670
an individual person, like just
referencing hierarchies of individuals and

429
00:24:56.670 --> 00:25:00.040
just not somebody, you know,
not somebody you've interacted with,

430
00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:07.870
you could simply just say,
I don't believe you prove

431
00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:13.390
that to me. Then I
think you would, that would

432
00:25:13.390 --> 00:25:17.890
force that individual to re
retake some stock to go

433
00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:21.820
back and actually try and
try and actually have that

434
00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:27.550
connection. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. I'm
actually, I mean, I wish

435
00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:29.530
it was a scalable situation
though. You know what I

436
00:25:29.530 --> 00:25:32.920
mean? Like I wish that
I could like help everyone.

437
00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:35.620
Like, you know how you,
you know, you want to

438
00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:37.330
do tech support for everybody,
You know what I mean?

439
00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:43.210
Yeah. I mean, yeah, I
sure, but I, I really,

440
00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:49.930
I don't and I can't,
I do what I can.

441
00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:54.550
I do what I like
to the point that it

442
00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:57.070
will burn me out and
I'll stop for a little.

443
00:25:57.140 --> 00:26:02.590
Wow. Yeah, yeah. The minute
I'm got the batteries charged,

444
00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:07.210
I'm back out again. I
am interested in what I

445
00:26:07.210 --> 00:26:14.470
can do here in my
area with my folks. And

446
00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:20.740
my hope is that they
would then be encouraged to

447
00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:25.180
do the same thing, what
I'm doing when I go

448
00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:28.360
out. And I just asked
strangers to pair and I

449
00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:32.230
sit down and just do
it with the way, you

450
00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:34.540
know, who cares. Let's just
do this. There's, there's no

451
00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:36.310
skin in the game for
either one of us. Let's

452
00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:43.230
just have fun if they
go and do that and

453
00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:46.980
then do it again, then
I hope the telephone effect

454
00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:52.800
happens. And then that's just
normal. But right now it's

455
00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:58.830
too easy to sit behind
that wall and not engage

456
00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:04.590
and simply played defensive and
just take wisecracks and shots

457
00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:08.660
at anything that you just
simply don't understand. Yeah. Yeah,

458
00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:12.290
exactly. The, sometimes as you're
giving me a lot of

459
00:27:12.290 --> 00:27:14.840
really interesting ideas about how
I can connect people like

460
00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:18.050
inside the big giant corporation
I work for with like,

461
00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:21.620
with reality, I always joke
about the Redmond reality distortion

462
00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:24.470
field. And I joke, and
I, and I have this,

463
00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:27.140
this kind of a irritation
with what I call college

464
00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:30.140
hires. And it's like, it's
like another 40 year old

465
00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:34.010
person. I'll just say guy
in a gender neutral way.

466
00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:37.280
Some 40 year old guy
who got to the big,

467
00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:40.250
giant multinational corporation when they
were 20 out of Iranian,

468
00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:42.710
straight out of school, they've
been there 20 years. Right.

469
00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:45.350
And I've got 20 years
experience and they've got 20

470
00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:46.910
years experience. And you'd think
that we would be like,

471
00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:48.830
cool, Hey, we're two old
guys. We've done a lot

472
00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:51.650
of stuff, but they think
they've got it all figured

473
00:27:51.650 --> 00:27:53.950
out because they work for
big, giant multinational. And they're

474
00:27:54.130 --> 00:27:56.510
really high up at the
company. And I've worked for

475
00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:58.370
a smattering of companies, you
know, a couple of years

476
00:27:58.370 --> 00:28:01.040
here, a couple of years
there. So I think I've

477
00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:04.010
got reality figured out, and
then we don't connect on

478
00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:07.370
reality. Like they've forgotten what
it's like to not work

479
00:28:07.370 --> 00:28:10.310
anywhere else because they've only
ever worked in one place.

480
00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:15.140
So I'm like, dude, you
need to quit, go and

481
00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:20.150
have a failed startup on
our products. And then come

482
00:28:20.150 --> 00:28:23.030
back. You mean like what
a great experience that would

483
00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:25.100
be. But I'm realizing that
since it's not going to

484
00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:29.750
happen, I can stop complaining
about those guys sucking and

485
00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:31.520
really just try to make
sure that they connect to

486
00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:34.070
the human being that is
using the product because they're

487
00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:37.400
not going to quit. Yeah.
Or even to their own

488
00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:40.250
ecosystem. So if they're not
going to venture that far

489
00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:42.770
out, right. If going that
far outside of the building

490
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:47.180
is too far, then give
them an opportunity to connect

491
00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:51.860
with a human being on
a human level directly. So,

492
00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:53.630
and all, now I'm going
to give it away for

493
00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:56.090
everyone. I've been giving this
away anyway. So, but like,

494
00:28:56.450 --> 00:28:58.970
yeah, So this will be
a good, a good finale.

495
00:28:59.150 --> 00:29:01.700
Now break it down. Here
we go. Or can do

496
00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:07.700
this, but here. So for
me, when I run into

497
00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:14.180
that challenge, my go-to was
to just simply ask if

498
00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:20.240
we could pair and they'll
usually be resistant to it.

499
00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:22.670
And I say that, so
it's okay. I got my

500
00:29:22.670 --> 00:29:26.120
laptop here. I'll just open
it. And I just open

501
00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:29.000
it and they sit down
inevitably and I'll just start

502
00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:34.850
just writing the worst stuff
I can possibly write. Nothing

503
00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:44.380
opens up. Somebody's like feeling
superior. And I, I don't

504
00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:47.710
care. Like obviously this is
somebody who's in their bubble

505
00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:51.310
anyway. So, and even if
they go out and they

506
00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:54.010
say, you know, I coated
with Leon and he's terrible.

507
00:29:55.150 --> 00:29:57.550
You know, I, my hope
would be that the next

508
00:29:57.550 --> 00:29:59.140
person sitting next to me,
well, wait a minute. I

509
00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:01.060
paired with him for like
four weeks. He was awesome.

510
00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:04.450
You know? Oh, he did
his crazy, he sucks thing

511
00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:09.820
to you. Oh, you know,
I, because to me that's

512
00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:12.880
really, it. It's, it's, it's,
it's the guide that you,

513
00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:15.100
the one who's not going
to go out and start

514
00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:17.260
a startup, the one who's
not going to go out

515
00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:19.390
to a dev group, the
one who's not going to

516
00:30:19.390 --> 00:30:21.160
go to a conference, the
one who's not going to

517
00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:24.160
engage on that level, who's
going to be set in

518
00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:27.940
their ways and not expand.
That's fine. That's a choice.

519
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.570
They're welcome to that. But
at that turns into something

520
00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:36.010
that becomes a cancer in
their organization, in our company,

521
00:30:36.490 --> 00:30:40.810
in their products, in, in
their lives that can be

522
00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:43.810
mitigated. And that could be
mitigated on a very small

523
00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:48.460
scale. And that's something that,
that, that niceness, that ability

524
00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:51.040
to fail in front of
others, that ability to be

525
00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:58.090
an open person is just
as infectious as the bile,

526
00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:04.990
as the negativity. And it's
far more rewarding. I did

527
00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:09.130
that. Kill him with kindness
and empathy. Why not? I

528
00:31:09.130 --> 00:31:10.990
mean, what's the difference? What
have you got to lose?

529
00:31:11.650 --> 00:31:15.280
What have I got to
lose by just showing that

530
00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:18.490
I'm willing to show you
my worst. And if you

531
00:31:18.490 --> 00:31:21.550
give me an opportunity, I
guarantee you I'll show you

532
00:31:21.550 --> 00:31:27.100
my best and I will
allow you, and I'll forward

533
00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:35.350
you the same, the same
opportunity. There's, there's nothing better

534
00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:39.790
than that. And then it's
easy. Then that's somebody who

535
00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:42.330
calls, you know, Hey, you
know, I got this problem.

536
00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:43.750
I was just, you know,
you don't wanna come over

537
00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:47.110
here and whiteboard with me.
Sure. Yeah, sure. I'll do,

538
00:31:50.250 --> 00:31:54.420
Everyone's got time for that.
There's no reason why you

539
00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:57.300
don't have that. Very cool.
I'm going to let it

540
00:31:57.300 --> 00:32:03.150
hang right there. Thank you
for hanging out a great

541
00:32:03.150 --> 00:32:06.660
point. This has been another
episode of Hanselminutes Leon. Gursing

542
00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:09.060
the rupee Buddha. We'll see
you again next week.
