9
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.060
talks with Raquel the labs
about controlling robots with JavaScript

10
00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:02.510
and node JS. Hi, this
is Scott Hanselman. This is

11
00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.240
another episode of Hansel minutes.
And today I'm talking again

12
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.240
to Raquel Velez. How are
you? Hi, I'm doing really

13
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.300
well. Thanks. We're going to
talk about robots. We talked

14
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.280
about node a little bit
last time and kind of

15
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.520
like getting people started in
node. And then I go

16
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.530
and I look@nodebots.io and I,
I blink. And the next

17
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.920
thing I know you're controlling
robots with JavaScript. Yeah, that's

18
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.450
pretty much, that's pretty much
right. So getting involved in,

19
00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.660
in robots for me seems
very intimidating. It seems like

20
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.910
I'm not going to be
smart enough. There's going to

21
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.900
be some SI involved. I've
overwritten all of those brain

22
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.160
cells with other information. All
my C related brain cells

23
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.800
are gone. Of course. Yeah.
Those are brain cells that

24
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.690
I've used in college. And
now they're, I don't know

25
00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.380
what they have on them
now, my friend number. Right.

26
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.830
And, and, and I seem
to see when I look

27
00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.140
around on like hacker news
and some of the, the,

28
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.040
the forums that there's kind
of mixed feelings about doing

29
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.640
kind of control systems and
hardware with JavaScript, there, there

30
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.620
are some people who feel
very strongly that this is

31
00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:13.190
a bad thing. And then
there are other things that

32
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.350
feel that this is really
the best thing that could

33
00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.140
ever happen. Like suddenly the
language that we can hack

34
00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.930
on in notepad and JavaScript
is not letting us control

35
00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.330
robots. So why JavaScript, Why
JavaScript? So the major question

36
00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.770
that I like to ask
is why not JavaScript? So

37
00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.320
the thing about about JavaScript
is that it's really prevalent.

38
00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.860
And especially amongst web developers,
if you're doing any front

39
00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.310
end code, you know, JavaScript,
if you're a node developer,

40
00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.400
you're obviously doing JavaScript, JavaScript
is really easy to pick

41
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.460
up. It's really easy to
use and people just love

42
00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.720
it. And the fact of
the matter is, so I

43
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.960
have, I've been, I've been
a roboticist for about 12

44
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.500
years now, so I've seen
it all from C plus

45
00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.060
plus Python, and now I'm
using JavaScript for my robots.

46
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.250
And the reason I do
it is not because it's

47
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.830
going to make my robot
faster or stronger or smarter

48
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:11.020
necessarily, but more about just
bringing robotics to more people.

49
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.170
You don't have to be
a CAEP developer or a

50
00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.200
Python developer to build robots
anymore. And you shouldn't have

51
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.220
to be it's about having
the opportunity to just say,

52
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.220
alright, let's, let's use what
we know. And we know

53
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.850
JavaScript and let's start playing
with some robots. And the

54
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:33.370
other major thing is when
I think about diversity of

55
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.230
thought, especially in fields that
are really complex, like robotics,

56
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.860
we think a lot about,
well, okay. So there are

57
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.610
all these people with PhDs
and huge, huge government checks,

58
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:51.970
writing, writing these amazing software
algorithms and, you know, building

59
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.270
these vehicles that can drive
by themselves and whatever, blah,

60
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.090
blah, blah. But there are
huge problems that they have,

61
00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.930
like sensor fusion is a
really hard problem to solve.

62
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.080
And the whole idea behind
sensor fusion is just imagine

63
00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.660
you are, you are a
robot and you have eyes

64
00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.210
and ears and a nose,
and trying to get all

65
00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:13.720
of that information tied into
one thing to try to

66
00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.540
decide, determine where you are
in the world and what

67
00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.580
you're doing the same. You
have the same problem with

68
00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:22.720
robots, right? You've got, got
cameras and you've got microphones

69
00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.190
and you've got a distance
and range sensors and trying

70
00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.770
to merge all of that
information together to, in a

71
00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.990
way that says, okay, I
know where I am. I

72
00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.570
know what I'm doing. That's
a really hard problem to

73
00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.510
solve. And sometimes I kind
of think about, well, what

74
00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.080
if as a Java script
developer, you come up with

75
00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.290
you come in with a
completely brand new, fresh understanding

76
00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.080
of the world. What if,
what if, what what's something

77
00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.140
like, no, which is a
single stream, a single thread

78
00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.060
language or platform either. What
if you could, what if

79
00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.310
we could solve that problem
in a completely different way,

80
00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.580
like using a different method.
So I kind of, from

81
00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.850
a more academic standpoint, I
like this notion of let's,

82
00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.860
let's just throw something, let's
show it all to the

83
00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.410
wind. Let's do something completely
different and try something new

84
00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.650
and see how it goes.
Okay. So let me see

85
00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.650
if we can take, take
this apart. That was a

86
00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.530
lot of information. I think
we have about a half

87
00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.320
an hour to, to understand
it. So I heard you

88
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.830
say that, that, and then
this sounded very academic, but

89
00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.740
sensor fusion is a big
problem. So that makes me

90
00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.760
feel like lots of different
disparate and diverse data streams

91
00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:33.540
like bumpers and, and audio
and infrared and all the

92
00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.790
different things that a robot
could use to make a

93
00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:39.690
determination about what to use
next are dealing with that

94
00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:43.890
stream of information. Those events
is extremely challenging. And I

95
00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:47.250
can only assume that using
a relatively low level language

96
00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.950
like C would just make
that more challenging. And you

97
00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.670
would presumably rely on the
last 20 years of C

98
00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:57.790
and robotics libraries to hide
that from you. Right, right.

99
00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.240
With JavaScript, you've got this
inventing model. Right? Exactly. So

100
00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.390
the thing is, so it's
something like C or Python,

101
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.390
you would have threats, right?
You, you have a multithreaded

102
00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:09.520
environment. And so what you
would normally do is you

103
00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.130
would have each sensor. So
let's say you've got a

104
00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:16.150
camera pair and you've got
a bumper sensor. Right. And

105
00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.220
so that's basically going to
help you. Let's say you're

106
00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:21.370
a little robot going around
a room or amaz it's

107
00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:23.110
going to help you see
the wall and feel the

108
00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:28.990
wall. So you'd have a
different thread stream for a

109
00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:34.090
bumper information and for, you
know, what you're seeing in

110
00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:38.290
front of you. And, and
then, so China, basically having

111
00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:41.860
those two parallel streams and
merging the data together in

112
00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.980
a way that says, okay,
here's, what's actually happening in

113
00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.920
the world. This is where
the wall is. That's a

114
00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:51.280
pretty difficult problem to solve.
Like, do you timestamp it?

115
00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:53.260
Or, you know, how do
you, how do you put

116
00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.830
all the information together in
JavaScript? You have this event

117
00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:00.460
ID system that basically says,
okay, well, I'm only going

118
00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:02.230
to take, you know, a
little bit of information at

119
00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:04.960
a time. So right now,
let me talk to all

120
00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.870
of my sensors, where are
we? Let's next thing. Let's

121
00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:09.940
talk to all my sensors,
where are we? And try

122
00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:12.430
to, like, basically you can
argue, I don't know. And

123
00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:14.230
I'm totally just making this
up as I go along.

124
00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:17.710
But, but I mean, that's
a possibility what if, what

125
00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:19.450
if we just think about
the problem in a completely

126
00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:22.120
different way? What if we
think about it using JavaScript

127
00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:25.360
instead of using, you know,
C or C plus plus,

128
00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.900
or Python or something Let's
get specific? What does JavaScript

129
00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:31.180
bringing? Is it the, is
it the event model? Is

130
00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:33.580
it the way that node
thinks about stream, you know,

131
00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:37.510
streams of data that, that
brings a different way of

132
00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:41.380
interacting with hardware? I think
so. I mean, I think

133
00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:43.840
that's the big thing. So,
so the way that we

134
00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:47.890
do node bots, let's, let's
step back and, and give

135
00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:53.350
some power to our listeners
here. So right now, kind

136
00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:56.230
of the most popular way
of doing, starting with node

137
00:07:56.230 --> 00:08:02.500
bots is to first say,
so you have an Arduino,

138
00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:06.610
which is just a nice
little microcontroller board that you

139
00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:08.710
can get for about 20
bucks. So are doing those

140
00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:11.020
are, are the kind of
pretty preferred way, or this

141
00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:13.390
is what the, I guess
the module that you start

142
00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:16.450
with is called the Johnny
five module from the short

143
00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:21.910
circuit movies, Arduinos assumed. Right.
Right. And so we stick

144
00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:25.810
with an Arduino for now.
They're just really prevalent, fairly

145
00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:30.010
cheap, really easy to get
your hands on in Arduino.

146
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.360
So you've got an Arduino
and you, you basically load

147
00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:38.170
it up with you, use
standard for Mada and you

148
00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:44.110
use fermata is just kind
of like the, the basic

149
00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:49.090
language for the Ardwino. And
so really right out of

150
00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:50.770
the box, you don't even
have to actually worry about

151
00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:54.790
anything. It comes with standard
fermata by default, but then

152
00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:57.210
you, it up with your
USB, plug it into your,

153
00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:00.480
into your computer and you
will use Johnny five, which

154
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:05.370
is a node module to
basically get started. And it's

155
00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:08.760
really easy if you're, if
you know, jQuery at all,

156
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:12.720
even if you're only just
like really tangentially, like familiar

157
00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.640
with it, you know, that
you kind of have this

158
00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:17.400
selector and then a dot
and then some sort of

159
00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:21.270
action. Right. And so Johnny
five is really similar in

160
00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:25.470
that you say, let's say
you're, instead of selecting like

161
00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:29.670
an element on your page,
you're selecting a sensor or

162
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:31.770
an actuator. And the difference
between a sensor and actuator

163
00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:34.380
is a sensor is something
that lets you see what's

164
00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:38.890
in the world. So like
a camera or like a

165
00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:42.930
bumper sensor or something like
that. And then an actuator

166
00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:45.270
is something that you put
out into the world. So

167
00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:49.800
like a motor or a
servo or an led. So,

168
00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:52.290
so you basically say, all
right, well let's say I

169
00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:55.470
have an led and you
plug it into your board.

170
00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:57.090
We can talk about that
in a different way and

171
00:09:57.090 --> 00:10:00.300
another time at a second
or something, but you plug

172
00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:02.760
it in and then in
your code you can just

173
00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:08.070
say led dot blink. Right.
And, and you will like,

174
00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:10.740
it'll turn on and turn
off if you have it.

175
00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:13.110
So it's something where it's
like really easy. Like you

176
00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:16.320
just have this, you have
a selector kind of, which

177
00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:19.560
is like your, your, the
piece that you're using. And

178
00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:23.040
then you have an action
that so servo dot blank

179
00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:26.550
or sorry, led dot blank
or servo dot move. And

180
00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:28.890
then you have, you can
put an argument's like move

181
00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:30.780
it 20 degrees. So you
just say serve with that,

182
00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:33.980
move to it. Okay. So
let's, let's break that down.

183
00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:39.080
I'm looking@thenodebox.io site. And we,
we go and we say

184
00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:42.080
require Johnny fives. We bring
in that library and then

185
00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:44.330
we say five dot board
and we make a new

186
00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:48.140
instance of board. And presumably
that represents the actual Arduino

187
00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:50.840
board that I'm looking at.
Right. And then just like

188
00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:54.380
we say, document ready. We
can say board ready when

189
00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:57.620
the board's ready, then do
some stuff. Presumably there's some

190
00:10:57.620 --> 00:10:59.990
initialization that happens and that's
why we need a ready.

191
00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:02.600
And then I'm looking at
some code here that says

192
00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:08.210
five dot led 13. Like
you could have an led

193
00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:10.910
sitting on pin 13. I
like that. I like that.

194
00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:13.220
It's not trying to hide
the board from me. And,

195
00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:16.400
you know, there's general purpose
IO and there's pins. And

196
00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:18.950
if the pins labeled 13,
the code can say 13,

197
00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:22.670
it's nice and clean five
dot led dot strobe or

198
00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:25.940
dot blink or dot whatever.
Right. So it really is

199
00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:28.340
that that's straight forward. That's,
that's really a Testament to

200
00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:30.650
the Johnny five library almost
more than it is to

201
00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:34.010
note itself. It is, it
is. And so the person

202
00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:36.860
behind Johnny five is a
good friend of mine, Rick

203
00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:41.420
Waldron. Who's actually on the
board of jQuery. He's on

204
00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:44.480
he's, he's one of those
guys who's helping push JavaScript

205
00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:48.230
forward. So you can kind
of see the, you can

206
00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:52.100
see jQuery in this and
all of his experience. And

207
00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:55.600
he's really, really made an
effort to just make this

208
00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:59.830
as easy as possible to
just get started. And, and

209
00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:02.950
what's beautiful is this little
example that you're seeing on

210
00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:05.680
node about stat IO, you
can actually go even deeper,

211
00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:08.860
right? Like instead of just
13, you can actually send

212
00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:12.790
in a Jason option, you'd
say pin 13 and I

213
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:15.940
want it to be well.
So at least for the

214
00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:18.670
led, it's a little, it's
not as exciting, but for

215
00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:20.080
like a servo, you can
say, I want it to

216
00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:23.920
go clockwise or counterclockwise. I
wanted to do so you

217
00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:26.710
can, you can send in
like an object, a Jayson

218
00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:30.270
object and really define what
that whole thing is Phrased

219
00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:33.210
phrase differently. When I say,
you know, make a new

220
00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:36.300
motor or make a new
servo, I can pass in

221
00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:40.710
basically an anonymous hash table
of name value pairs, which

222
00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:42.600
are all the parameters that
I want to load it

223
00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:45.420
up with all the behaviors
as a, as a payload,

224
00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:49.200
it's almost like a big
optional parameters list. Right? Exactly.

225
00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:52.770
Exactly. So in JavaScript, as
opposed to some other languages,

226
00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:55.980
instead of having a comma
separated list, while you can

227
00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:59.460
do that in, in JavaScript,
if you have a very

228
00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:02.970
long list, it's generally a
little bit more, the, the

229
00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:06.350
practices is a little bit
more to send in a

230
00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:09.540
hash, which we, it for
us, it's a Jason object

231
00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:14.340
and, and that has all
that information, but in one

232
00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:17.760
parameter, as opposed to say
up to a million. Yeah.

233
00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:19.620
You know, and that's actually
a really interesting point that's

234
00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:22.740
worth kind of like going
over again that, like, I

235
00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:24.930
think thinking about me as
a, as a primarily C

236
00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:27.600
sharp developer and one that's
been doing it for, you

237
00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:30.720
know, 10 years of C-sharp,
we would have these extremely

238
00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:36.150
long, you know, operator overload
kind of things, method overloads,

239
00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:38.700
where we'd have like one
of seven, you know, and

240
00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:41.790
then towards the end of
the, the, the, this comma,

241
00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:44.670
this comma, this, it would
just go to hell with

242
00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:47.190
all due respect. It would
just be like, okay, just

243
00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:48.930
take an object. I have
no idea what you, you

244
00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:51.570
know, what you want from
me. And it's a mess

245
00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:53.910
to program it's a mess
to use. And it was

246
00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:56.820
all in this idea that
we would try to support

247
00:13:56.820 --> 00:14:01.350
and tell a sense, but
then JavaScript, jQuery, jQuery, plugins

248
00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:04.050
have this idea of passing
an adjacent object and saying,

249
00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:06.210
here's my payload. If it's
there, use it. If it's

250
00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:09.570
not use a smart default,
right. It's a much more

251
00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:12.240
elegant way of kind of
like setting up a state

252
00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:17.040
machine than a whole pile
of overloads. Right? Exactly. Exactly.

253
00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:20.970
So I'm looking here at
the Johnny five library. You

254
00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:23.070
can get this of course
up at get hub at,

255
00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:29.190
at Rick Walden's site, he's
got servos and motors and

256
00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:33.240
sonar and claws and all
this stuff. Now these make

257
00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.220
an assumption, of course, that
you're still you're using an

258
00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:37.200
Arduino, but if I'm going
to do something like a

259
00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:43.350
claw, is, is this a
specific physical object I have

260
00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:45.990
to buy? How do I
reconcile what the code does

261
00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:48.690
versus what the hardware I
happen to have is Right.

262
00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:53.930
So, so certainly, so most
of these things on the

263
00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:57.800
Johnny five repo are things
that other people have done

264
00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:02.720
with whatever they have. Johnny
five itself is just a,

265
00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:05.150
it's like a base system.
So you can really build

266
00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:08.960
whatever you want. Now yes,
you can go online and

267
00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:11.420
buy a claw. Or if
you want to be super

268
00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:15.530
hackery, you can, you can
print your own. If you

269
00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:21.850
have your own three D
printer, I'm just saying, Yeah,

270
00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:27.070
You could do that. Or
you could just say, you

271
00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:28.360
know what, I'm not going
to do a clot. I'm

272
00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.880
just going to have an
led while I wait until

273
00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:34.120
I get a claw or
something like that. But certainly

274
00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:39.160
you can do whatever you
want. It's, it's just about

275
00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:41.680
it. Really. I like to
think about Johnny five is

276
00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:47.860
the Legos needed for your,
your larger Lego project. So

277
00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:50.470
then presumably I could come
at any point and I

278
00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:53.080
could add Johnny five dot
arm and have that be

279
00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:57.550
my own thing. Absolutely. There's,
there's actually a, I believe

280
00:15:57.550 --> 00:16:02.350
there's a sensor. So like
you could create your own,

281
00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:06.190
I mean, it's super extensible
in the sense that you

282
00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:10.990
could create your own claw
function and then just have

283
00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:15.070
like a claw dot on
covid.org or, or open or

284
00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:18.880
close, or, you know, Claude
that lift, if you want

285
00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:21.490
it to that basically has
all the functionality that says

286
00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:24.130
I'm going to open my
claw and reach for the

287
00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:27.280
can close the call around
the can and pick up

288
00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:30.100
the can or something like
that. Assuming you have a

289
00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:33.880
claw that picks up soda
cans or something, Is node

290
00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:37.420
fast enough on an Arduino,
or is it an Arduino

291
00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:40.360
thing that might prevent you
from doing something like video

292
00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:43.660
recognition and having an, having
it recognized that there's a

293
00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:47.470
can there and then picking
it up? Right. So it's

294
00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:52.450
important to note that the
code does not necessarily run

295
00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:56.110
on Arduino itself. So the
way that it works is

296
00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:59.320
you have, you have node
running on your machine, so

297
00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:02.230
on your, on your personal
computer, and then you use

298
00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:06.610
a USB cable to send
commands. So, so the way

299
00:17:06.610 --> 00:17:09.850
it works is you've got
Johnny five, which is Brian,

300
00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:13.180
right, which is a library
on node. And Johnny five

301
00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:18.190
goes through and, and talks
to a note for Mada,

302
00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:22.570
which is the node kind
of wrapper around for Mada.

303
00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:26.230
That basically then turns all
of the notes, stuff that

304
00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:29.650
you've written in Johnny five
and turns it into four

305
00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:33.640
Mata calls. And then the
fermata calls are sent across

306
00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:37.330
the wire to Arduino, and
that's kind of translated into

307
00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:41.320
Arduino code. And then that
all kind of turns on

308
00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:45.430
and off different pins, et
cetera. Okay. So the Arduino

309
00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:50.430
isn't the brain, it's the
nervous system. Exactly, exactly. And

310
00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:53.760
so if you wanted to
do comp like the camera,

311
00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:57.960
like if you wanted to
have object recognition with some

312
00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:00.870
sort of camera or connection
like that, right. You would

313
00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:04.290
probably actually not connect that
to your Arduino. You'd probably

314
00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:07.290
connect that to your CA
your computer, and then you

315
00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:11.370
would use other libraries to
kind of connect everything together

316
00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:17.040
and have it all flow.
So, so what some people

317
00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:21.120
are doing actually is connecting
raspberry pies to their Arduinos

318
00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:24.090
and having everything run off
of the pie. And then

319
00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:26.400
that way, cause the raspberry
pie is like this little

320
00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:30.170
credit card size computer. That
is awesome. You're point out

321
00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:32.630
that a raspberry PI actually
has some oomph to it

322
00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:36.200
and can do some work
while an Arduino is really

323
00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:39.530
slow. Cause I mean, it's
dumb. It's, it's literally just

324
00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:42.650
it's, you know, it's an
IO just on off, turn

325
00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:46.220
it on off, you know,
turn it off. I'm realizing

326
00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:47.630
we don't have, I was
worried about the re they

327
00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:49.850
are doing those feelings, but
ultimately I don't really care

328
00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:53.840
what are doing, although, you
know, if it had, like,

329
00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:56.270
if I started to anthropomorphize
that, you know, this really

330
00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:58.640
cute robot, I'm going to
feel sad, but the Arduino

331
00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:00.380
isn't powerful enough to run
nodes. So this is an

332
00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:04.070
interesting point. And this is
a real interesting philosophical architectural

333
00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:06.800
decision that you've made here
is you're saying we love

334
00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:09.950
doing node and we have
really powerful computers and it's

335
00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:12.560
okay to have them, at
least while we're doing our

336
00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:15.380
testing tethered with a USB
cable. Cause some people might

337
00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:18.380
say, Oh, you got all
this way into the podcast.

338
00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:20.450
And there's like a giant
desktop computer and I can

339
00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:23.570
only get the robot as
far as USB reaches. Right?

340
00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:27.470
Well, so the, the, the
solutions to that are several

341
00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:30.800
fold. Number one, use a
really, really long USB cable

342
00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:35.960
number two, number two, get
yourself a nice mini laptop,

343
00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:38.360
like a Mac book air,
or, or one of those,

344
00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:43.790
you know, tiny 10 inch
laptops or Rick has actually

345
00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:49.070
been working on using a,
having it wireless. So you

346
00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:52.730
could basically have you have
two boards, you have Arduino

347
00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:59.960
one that has a it.
Yeah, yeah, exactly. And, and

348
00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:03.710
then you basically, Yes, by
the way, ZigBee is sometimes

349
00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:09.320
called zigb E but it's
like tiny Bluetooth. Maybe It's

350
00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:11.840
more like a radio. I
think of it more as,

351
00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:16.280
as a radio instead of
a Bluetooth. But the idea

352
00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:19.730
is still the same. You
basically have you basically just

353
00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:23.900
sending all of your Johnny
five slash fermata code over

354
00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:27.560
the air to your other
robot. And so I've actually

355
00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:29.480
seen it in action. So
you can have your little

356
00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:32.760
robot running around separately. So
it's kind of like a

357
00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:37.610
wireless serial port. Yes. Okay.
So I have a question

358
00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:39.380
and I haven't done this
before on this show. I'm

359
00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:40.880
going to actually take my
headphones on. I'm going to

360
00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:42.890
run five feet over there.
I'm going to show you

361
00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:44.090
something. And I want you
to tell me if I

362
00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:47.590
can make it a robot,
hang on. Okay. You entertain

363
00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:51.150
the people. All right. So
I would like to say

364
00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:54.510
that coming up in December,
if this is something that

365
00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:59.580
really interests you in December,
we have robots comp, which

366
00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:04.980
is a poly language conference.
So whether you're a.net or

367
00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:08.370
a Ruby or a Python
or a JavaScript or anything

368
00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:11.190
else, sort of developer, and
you want to kind of

369
00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:14.190
bridge the gap between software
and hardware and, and start

370
00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:16.680
hacking away. It's a two
day conference and Amelia Island,

371
00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:19.650
Florida. It's amazing. I have
this, I have a really

372
00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:22.110
awesome discount code. So if
that's something that interests you

373
00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:27.840
definitely take part a robots,
cuff.com. The discount code is

374
00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:30.810
poly bots, P O L
Y B O T S.

375
00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:34.020
So it's not just node
bots. It's it's any language

376
00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:37.650
bot P O L Y
B O T S N.

377
00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:39.570
Scott. We'll put that in
the show notes. I'm sure.

378
00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:42.210
Great. Cool. So yeah, now
you're like a cohost. This

379
00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:45.000
is good. Alright, so check
this out. So I'm, we're

380
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.370
on Skype. I'm holding this
up, I've got this robot

381
00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:53.070
that I got@roboticsconnection.com and it's
kind of this, it looks

382
00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:58.110
like an orange trap OID,
and it's got really awesome.

383
00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:01.200
Like again, I know nothing
about electronics, but I know

384
00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:05.280
it has really awesome wheels
and it has a cool

385
00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:10.140
wireless antenna thing and a
giant nine volt battery. And,

386
00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:14.970
but it is discontinued. I
can't find any information about

387
00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:17.190
it. All I know is
that it has a light

388
00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:19.290
when I turn it on
and it has a bunch

389
00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:22.470
of control ports and stuff
like that. I don't think

390
00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:25.200
that's an Arduino inside. It.
It's just some thing that

391
00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:28.560
robots, connection.com made. Right. But
I don't know anything about

392
00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:31.830
soldering or like, I don't
have a multimedia. Let's say

393
00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:34.980
I think that we go
to Goodwill sometimes and we

394
00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:37.020
find a dead robot and
we want to bring it

395
00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:39.960
back to life. My five-year-old
desperately wants to fix this.

396
00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:44.820
How would I go and
take an, a robot of

397
00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:48.960
unknown origin here and potentially
get this thing to move.

398
00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:50.670
If I don't know about
it, I don't know much

399
00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:52.950
like what I just get
in Arduino and start seeing

400
00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:55.590
if I could get a
motor to move. I, I

401
00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:59.670
would say so. So depending
on how attached to it,

402
00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:02.430
you are, I mean, that's
a great looking chassis, so

403
00:23:02.490 --> 00:23:04.740
that's fine. Yeah. So you've
just said basically everything is

404
00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:07.530
useless, but the chassis even
has an eyeball on the

405
00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:10.800
front there. Yeah. Well, so
that sensor, I know you

406
00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:14.400
can use that sensor in
Johnny five. So all you

407
00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:17.160
need to do is really
just kind of disconnect, like,

408
00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:19.770
you know, cut the, cut
the wires as close to

409
00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:22.470
the board as possible. So
you have as much leeway,

410
00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:26.340
right. It comes off. They're
all, they're all in there

411
00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:29.820
just on pressure so I
can tear it apart completely.

412
00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:33.840
Yeah. So then, you know,
start playing around with definitely

413
00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:37.230
start plugging things in. I
would definitely recommend starting out

414
00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:41.910
with some, you know, go
to documentation, do whatever, like

415
00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:45.800
do a little bit of
research. But if you're IRC,

416
00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:48.740
which I know is totally,
you know, 1996 of me

417
00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:53.150
to say, but if you're
on IRC, there's, we're in

418
00:23:53.150 --> 00:24:00.200
Freenode of robot, a robot
JS, hashtag robot JS. And

419
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:01.820
there's a bunch of us
who hang out in there.

420
00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:04.400
And a lot of us
are perfectly happy to answer

421
00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:08.360
questions. So, you know, send
some pictures out into the

422
00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:10.820
world and ask around Twitter
is a great way to

423
00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:14.150
get ahold of different people.
We're happy to answer questions

424
00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:19.100
any time, but definitely to
start. So the biggest thing

425
00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:23.360
I think software people have
that they're scared about, which

426
00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:26.180
is a total misnomer to
me. I mean, software people

427
00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:30.050
are perfectly willing to spend
six hours in the middle

428
00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:32.120
of the night with this
brand new idea. And they'll

429
00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:37.010
just hack away on, on
code and have something the

430
00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:39.260
next day, you know, like
they'll have like a webpage

431
00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:41.240
and all this stuff. And
you're like, Whoa, you did

432
00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:43.550
this in six hours. But
as soon as they see

433
00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:46.010
hardware, they're like, Oh my
God, what if I break

434
00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:49.450
it? Yeah, exactly. That you're
exactly right. I will spend

435
00:24:49.810 --> 00:24:51.580
days and days and days
trying to get a bootstrap

436
00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:54.880
template look perfect, but I
don't want to shock myself.

437
00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:56.440
Like I'm looking at this
thing and I'm like, well,

438
00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:59.110
I know it's got great
motors cause they're heavy, but

439
00:24:59.170 --> 00:25:01.150
I'm going to totally shock
myself and then I'll be

440
00:25:01.150 --> 00:25:04.480
dead and they'll find my
body. And they'll like, No,

441
00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:06.310
but see, here's the other
thing, right? Like as long

442
00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:09.490
as you, you, you focus
on some really basic stuff.

443
00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:11.470
So first of all, if
you found that at Goodwill,

444
00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:15.670
I mean, hypothetically, so a
lot of this stuff is

445
00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:19.060
not that expensive. And if
you really want to be

446
00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:22.750
careful in terms of your
money and, and your, you

447
00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:28.330
know, internal systems, whatever. Yeah.
Life, Your internal systems. I

448
00:25:28.330 --> 00:25:30.730
just don't want to shock
myself. These motors look awesome.

449
00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:32.980
I know. So what you
could do is you could

450
00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:35.680
just go online, go to
spark fund, get the spark

451
00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:37.480
fund in ventures, kit. And
it comes with a couple

452
00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:41.740
of teeny little motors that
with it, it doesn't take

453
00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:44.890
very much voltage. It won't
hurt you. You could literally

454
00:25:44.890 --> 00:25:47.740
like stick it to your
tongue and it won't hurt

455
00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:52.720
you that much. I'm glad
that you know, that It's

456
00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:57.700
super scary, but, but the
point is that just, you

457
00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:02.470
should just experiment. It's really
not that dangerous. Like the

458
00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:05.710
most you're putting into your
system is like nine volts.

459
00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:08.140
I mean, coming out of
your USB, if you don't

460
00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:10.810
even add any batteries and
you're just using your Arduino,

461
00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:13.180
you're not even going to
get a full five volts

462
00:26:13.210 --> 00:26:15.310
out of your USB, hooked
up to your, you know,

463
00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:19.900
you're not going to hurt
yourself. And, and it's okay

464
00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:22.150
to break stuff like a
resistor costs. I think like

465
00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:25.300
half a penny or something
like, like you buy 50

466
00:26:25.330 --> 00:26:30.340
resistors for like two bucks.
It's not that expensive at

467
00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:34.840
all. Just start playing around,
start figuring things out, ask

468
00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:39.160
questions, ask lots and lots
of questions. Soldering can be

469
00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:41.200
a little scary at first,
but once you get it,

470
00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:45.180
you like, I love doing
with people and showing them

471
00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:47.880
how to like light an
led. And I feel like,

472
00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:51.300
I feel like Prometheus's bringing
fire to the people, you

473
00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:53.640
know, like it's just, it's
amazing. People are like, Oh

474
00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:57.090
my God, I can turn
on lights. I need to

475
00:26:57.090 --> 00:27:00.510
think it's silly, but it's
really powerful because then as

476
00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:01.590
soon as, as soon as
I do that and I'm

477
00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:03.930
like, okay, here are a
bunch of motors and things

478
00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:06.930
go forth and then people
will build just the most

479
00:27:06.930 --> 00:27:11.640
amazing stuff. So yes. All
I have to say is

480
00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:15.450
try it, go ask the
questions, let me ask you

481
00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:19.190
this. Yeah. Build stuff. And
you go to their house

482
00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:21.620
and see their garage. And
there's like, it's strewn about

483
00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:25.250
with like half done robots.
How many robots have you

484
00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:29.030
built where they're in your
life still like, you know,

485
00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:31.190
I was watching the beginning
of back to the future

486
00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:34.580
and the very first back,
the future Marty comes into

487
00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:40.100
doc Scott's or doc Brown's
office. And like the alarm

488
00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:42.770
goes off in this kind
of whole row, Rube Goldberg

489
00:27:42.770 --> 00:27:45.500
and thing where the robot
makes toast for him and

490
00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:48.620
feeds the dog. Do you
have any robots in your

491
00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:51.860
life that are like getting
you a soda? No, not

492
00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:55.010
right now. So the thing
is that I think having

493
00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:57.590
robots that bring you sodas,
it's a really hard problem

494
00:27:57.590 --> 00:28:00.230
to solve. It's super hard.
I mean, if you think

495
00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:02.870
about it, like we take
for granted, the fact that

496
00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:06.170
we're able to a balance,
right. Balance is such a

497
00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:08.840
hard problem to solve. We
take for granted that we

498
00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:13.970
can see computer vision is
hard. We, we know where

499
00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:19.760
we are in our house,
state estimation and, and understanding

500
00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:23.660
your environment is a really
hard problem to solve. So

501
00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:26.120
just those basic things are,
and now you have to

502
00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:28.130
think about, okay, well now
I want this robot to

503
00:28:28.130 --> 00:28:30.350
go from where I am
now, all the way over

504
00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:34.070
to the kitchen, open the
refrigerator, pick up a soda.

505
00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:36.500
And it's not just as
simple as go get me

506
00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:41.900
a soda. It's, you know,
go three steps forward, turn

507
00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:48.290
right, goes 17 steps forward,
turn, left. Don't trip on

508
00:28:48.290 --> 00:28:54.140
anything, open the door, step
back, like, look through, look

509
00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:57.200
at your, your refrigerator, where
is the sodium to find

510
00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:59.570
it. And then you have
to like, you know, put

511
00:28:59.570 --> 00:29:03.380
your arm out and then
it's not just grab the

512
00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:07.970
soda. It's open your claw,
bind the soda, like put

513
00:29:07.970 --> 00:29:10.400
the soda in there, claw,
close the club, come back.

514
00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:13.370
Like all of those are
And any one of those

515
00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:16.040
has it even deeper problems?
Like how much pressure do

516
00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:18.380
you put on the claw?
And what if you're crushing

517
00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:20.690
it? What if you picked
some hot sauce instead of

518
00:29:20.690 --> 00:29:24.050
a soda and on and
on Exactly. There's this, there's

519
00:29:24.050 --> 00:29:27.020
actually a video on YouTube.
There's this company called Willow

520
00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:30.110
garage and they have this
robot called the PR too.

521
00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:33.740
And I think Willow is
actually slowly disappearing. And the

522
00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:36.740
PR team just continued. Yeah.
Which is too bad. But

523
00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:39.350
there is this YouTube video
so exists and you can

524
00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:44.830
actually see this robot and
they've basically they've, they've like

525
00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:48.850
they, they show it at
like six X speed and

526
00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:51.250
it, it still takes like
10 minutes for this robot

527
00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:53.650
to go from one end
of the, of the office,

528
00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:56.770
over to the, to the
refrigerator, pick up a soda

529
00:29:56.770 --> 00:30:00.310
and come back. And it's
just like, so it takes

530
00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:02.830
like half an hour for
this robot to go all

531
00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:05.340
the way over and come
all the way. Yeah. I

532
00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:07.890
think even the lazy laziest
of us would eventually just

533
00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:09.810
get up and go and
get there. I mean, if

534
00:30:09.810 --> 00:30:11.460
you had to wait 30
minutes for your robot to

535
00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:16.290
bring you the soda or
just, you know, get up

536
00:30:16.290 --> 00:30:21.840
yourself and take 30 seconds,
it's hard, but they're coming,

537
00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:23.670
right. I mean, we have,
we have, we're about to

538
00:30:23.970 --> 00:30:26.400
vacuum for us. And we
have robots that mopped for

539
00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:29.310
us. And we have robots
that clean our pools and

540
00:30:29.550 --> 00:30:33.450
clean out our gutters. And
so it's, it's coming the,

541
00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:35.970
the, where I'm working right
now, I work at a

542
00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:39.270
company called SaaS labs and
we're working on robots that

543
00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:43.380
will test your mobile apps
for you. So we're doing

544
00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:46.200
a lot of really cool
things. Robots are not just

545
00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:49.320
the whimsical fun things of
once upon a time, they're

546
00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:51.480
actually going to be really
useful for a long time

547
00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:54.390
coming forward. Well then it
may actually be that we

548
00:30:54.390 --> 00:30:56.640
won't end up with robots
that can balance and walk

549
00:30:56.640 --> 00:31:00.480
around. It seems that node
copters and these quad copters

550
00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:04.230
are actually much easier to
program and control. We can

551
00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:08.130
fly something and have it
hover more, more easily than

552
00:31:08.130 --> 00:31:09.990
we can make it simply
walk on two feet. We

553
00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:12.660
may end up having a
node copter, go over, open

554
00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:15.000
the fridge and then fly
me a soda before we'll

555
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.670
have one that can walk
over there. Absolutely. Or, or

556
00:31:17.670 --> 00:31:20.850
even better. You just have
one robot whose entire job

557
00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:23.400
it is, is to open
the refrigerator, grab the soda

558
00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:25.530
and close the refrigerator. And
then you have the node

559
00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:28.740
copter pick up your, pick
up the soda from that

560
00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:30.870
robot and then deliver it
to you. So you don't

561
00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:33.060
even have to have one
robot that does everything. And

562
00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:35.790
this is the problem because
now in my mind, I

563
00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:40.350
can see the solution, the
robot, the robot soda arm

564
00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:43.140
will live in the fridge.
So it will actually push

565
00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:47.190
the fridge from the inside
out, ah, there, and then

566
00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:50.670
have, then an arm will
extend out of the fridge.

567
00:31:50.670 --> 00:31:53.340
So the fridge will offer
the soda up. See, this

568
00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:55.740
is like, this is all
like love Demeter and everything

569
00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:57.420
like that. Right? So now
I'm trying to figure out,

570
00:31:57.690 --> 00:32:01.230
you know, single responsibility principle.
It is there's one robot

571
00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:03.660
to open the door one
to extend the soda, the

572
00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:06.960
node copter then flies over
there. And then all I

573
00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:08.130
have to do is make
sure it doesn't hit the

574
00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:11.370
children as it comes to.
And, and you know, that

575
00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:14.310
should be fine. Just make
sure that, that it flies

576
00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:16.830
at a high enough height
that your children could, you

577
00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:21.510
know, be standing and it
won't hit them. Yeah. Sounds

578
00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:24.180
good, Scott. I think, I
think you should go to

579
00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:25.920
it and I'll see you
in a couple of months,

580
00:32:26.910 --> 00:32:30.450
look forward to seeing it.
Cause now I know you're

581
00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:32.640
just gonna sit there and
like you're working on it.

582
00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:34.470
I got to figure out
how this, there has to

583
00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:37.350
be a way for me
to get a soda. I

584
00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:40.760
really appreciate you sharing this
passion with, with us and

585
00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:43.070
give me a link, a
bunch of links. We'll put

586
00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:45.050
them at the show notes.
And of course we've got

587
00:32:45.050 --> 00:32:47.240
a special code for people
who want to go to

588
00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:50.920
the conference. This has been
great. Thank you so much

589
00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:54.290
as always. It's super fun.
Anytime you want to talk

590
00:32:54.290 --> 00:32:58.340
about robots, holler, man, Twitter,
anytime. Very cool. This has

591
00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:01.460
been another episode of Hanselminutes
and we'll see you again

592
00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:02.000
next week.
