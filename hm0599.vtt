Hi, this is Scott Hanselman.

8
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.210
This is another episode of
Hansel minutes. And today I'm

9
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.290
talking with Ryan Buckley. She is
the co founder and CEO

10
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.080
at fit code. This is
a company that helps women's

11
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.290
of all shapes and sizes
shop with confidence using a

12
00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.100
technology to make it happen.
How are you? I'm well,

13
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.950
how are you, Scott? Very
well. Thanks for chatting with

14
00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.430
me today. You've got an
interesting product here and it

15
00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.840
seems like it's going to
well disrupt an industry that

16
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.720
I don't think is particularly
technologically savvy. I don't think

17
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.270
of the fashion industry as
being at the forefront of,

18
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.660
of tech. Yeah. You know,
we couldn't agree more. It's

19
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.140
a interesting place to be
in this, this beautiful fashion

20
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.420
tech space. And what we're
trying to do is just

21
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.940
bring technology to an industry
that could really use it.

22
00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.120
So, you know, we've all
heard about where retail's at

23
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.700
right now. And our goal
is to make the whole

24
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.450
process of online shopping easier
and more transparent and more

25
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.900
successful for our customers and
the retailers. So it's a

26
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.750
really exciting time to be
in the space. When I

27
00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.530
think of the technology that
I have used in retail,

28
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.640
it's, you know, I used
to work@acompanycalledeighthundred.com and we sold

29
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.510
DVDs. So it's the same
shopping cart we've been using

30
00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.150
for 15 years. The lockout
process, you know, we have

31
00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.160
things like Stripe, but for
the most part, we, we

32
00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.020
scroll through pictures. Some of
which are nice pictures on

33
00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.000
which are not. We pick
products, we try them out.

34
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.270
And the most innovation I've
seen is, you know, a

35
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.300
Zappos lets you return the
shoes that don't fit, but

36
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.460
there's not a lot going
on. In fact, the only

37
00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.970
really interesting technology that I
saw was at Amazon where

38
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.750
you could spin the model
360 degrees and see what

39
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.480
the, what the outfit looks
like. But it sounds like

40
00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.400
you think that there's a
bigger problem and that's the

41
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.010
fit of the clothing. Yeah.
You know, I think there

42
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.350
are two big problems, one
it's that people want to

43
00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.410
shop online and we're not
making that easy for customers.

44
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.740
There's obviously the fit problem
too. But first things first

45
00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.560
it's, you know, as a
customer, you go onto a

46
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.680
big online retailer or brand
website and you see hundreds

47
00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.450
to thousands of images of
denim specifically, and customers don't

48
00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.460
know where to start. So
since they don't have dressing

49
00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.550
rooms and since it's all
e-commerce now they don't know

50
00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.260
what genes to choose. And
so that's where a fit

51
00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.500
code comes in. We say,
Hey, let's take all noise

52
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.780
out of the process, take
this quick quiz. And then

53
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.250
we're going to narrow all
this down for you and

54
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.070
make it easier from there.
We of course focus on

55
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.290
the fit and that that's
the biggest issue right now

56
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.390
is, you know, really getting
these brands to make jeans

57
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.100
that fit their customer base.
Is this primarily focused on

58
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.970
women? Because as a man,
I would very much like

59
00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.450
a 33 34 pair of
jeans and I can, I

60
00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.310
can't really find them in
the store. Like they're either

61
00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.190
too big or they're too
tight. Absolutely. So right now

62
00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.920
we just do women's denim,
but we're actually going to

63
00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.360
be launching with men's this
fall. So we're super excited

64
00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.150
to do that. So yeah.
So beyond the lookout, we,

65
00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.400
we will reach out and
get you those size 33

66
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.360
jeans. Okay. See, that's pretty
cool. I like that. I

67
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.800
would even be cooler if
I could, like, I don't

68
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.390
know, take a selfie and
then you could figure out

69
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.610
what my shape is and
fill the quiz out for

70
00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.340
me. Yeah. That would be
pretty cool. You know, interestingly

71
00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.040
enough, Scott, when we were
doing a bunch of this

72
00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.130
beta research, when we first
found in this project is

73
00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.940
that we realized that, you
know, we started with women

74
00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.760
and we realized that while
they need a technical solution,

75
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.080
because we need to be
able to integrate on these

76
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.380
eCommerce sites, they don't want
a really technical product. And

77
00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.170
I think that goes for
men and women's yeah. So,

78
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.390
you know, think about when
you're shopping online, most people

79
00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.150
are doing it while doing
another, another activity. They're, you

80
00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.610
know, watching for me, it's
watching real Housewives, you know,

81
00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.620
whatever you're watching and you
just want to sign on

82
00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.200
real quick, find the jeans
that fit and then get

83
00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.320
back to your daily, you
know, activities. Interesting. Okay. So

84
00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.840
you, you go in to
ask these questions and they're

85
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.900
pretty straightforward and it's, it's
not complicated. It's, it's a

86
00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.060
10, I don't know, 10
seconds. My wife went through

87
00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.580
it and 10 seconds came
up with a fit code.

88
00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.830
She has a number now,
not a measurement, but a

89
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.240
number that's seven, 10. And
the in encapsulated within that

90
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.390
number is a lot of
things more than just your

91
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:46.530
inseam and your waist. Absolutely.
So the fit codes are

92
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.710
arbitrary three digit numbers that
represent a body shape. So

93
00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.690
within the fit code, there
can be a whole range

94
00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.630
of sizes. And then of
course there are all the

95
00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.150
genes that map to that
fit code. So we know

96
00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.850
all the measurements, we standardize
them across brands. So we

97
00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.760
know how, you know, one
brand fits against another because

98
00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.560
we all know how it
is. You can be, you

99
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.540
know, a size 28 and
one gene and the size

100
00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.090
29, another brand. And you
just don't know what size

101
00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.120
to buy. So all of
that data lives under the

102
00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.380
fit code. Okay. So I've
got this, this number and

103
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.820
then what do I do
with it? Do I go

104
00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.860
over to instant to search
for that number? Or do

105
00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.500
I, does it know my
profile now? And it only

106
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.780
shows me things that are
the right fit. Yeah. So

107
00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.850
it knows your profile. And
when you press shop now,

108
00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.950
after getting your fit code,
you'll see that, you know,

109
00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:31.710
on a website like Joe's
jeans who just integrated with

110
00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.690
us a couple of weeks
ago, you'll see that we

111
00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:35.970
actually do what we call
badging. And so your fit

112
00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.430
code seven, 10 icon is
going to pop up on

113
00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.500
any of the gene images
that are gonna fit you.

114
00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.710
So now when you're searching
through all of these product

115
00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.810
images, we make it really
clear. We say, Hey, here

116
00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.400
are the ones that are
going to fit. And then

117
00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.930
once you open it, we
tell you what size to

118
00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.210
buy in it. But for
us, you know, we really

119
00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.370
come from a space of
wanting to focus on fit,

120
00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.920
not size. So first things
first we have to make

121
00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.950
sure this Jean flatters your
body type, and then we

122
00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:00.340
can tell you what size
to buy in it. Okay.

123
00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.370
Interesting. So Joe's jeans is
a partner. You are not

124
00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.040
Joe's jeans, you're fit code,
but then they integrate with

125
00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:10.660
you. Exactly. Okay. So then
I take that code over

126
00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:11.980
there. And now that I
know that it's almost like

127
00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:15.280
my sleep number. That's an
awesome, I haven't heard that,

128
00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.780
but that is an awesome
way to think about it.

129
00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.360
Yes. Look at the sleep
number bed, like that's become

130
00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.010
part of the ethos. We
all know what that is.

131
00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:23.320
Now. The fit code will
become that as well. Yeah.

132
00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.480
You know, that's our goal.
We want people to someday

133
00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:27.280
wonder how they ever shopped
at that free code. You

134
00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.200
know, how did you shop
without someone coming in and

135
00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.940
calling you, Hey, here are
the products to buy and

136
00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:34.060
this is the size to
buy it in. Okay. So

137
00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.970
let's talk a little bit
about technology. You've got this

138
00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:39.880
number that, and there's, you
know, I don't know how

139
00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.280
many combinations there are. I'm
looking at your, your quiz

140
00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.710
there. That probably hundreds of
comments. There are quite a

141
00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:47.320
few. Yes. Yeah. So then
you come up with this

142
00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:51.640
number and your technology is,
it looks like it's JavaScript

143
00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:55.180
inside of the fit code.com.
How do I, if I'm

144
00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:58.360
a, a reseller of jeans
or if I'm a fashion

145
00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:01.390
brand and I want to
make sure that people with

146
00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:03.610
fit codes can come and
find the right pants, how

147
00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:06.820
do I integrate? Yeah. So
our big thing is we

148
00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:08.530
want to make it really
easy for these brands. So

149
00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:10.660
we know they have other
businesses to attend to, and

150
00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:14.020
we want to make this
technology integration super, super easy.

151
00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:16.900
So we just do JavaScript.
We integrate straight on their

152
00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.840
front end and then we
control everything from there. So

153
00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:22.240
if you're on a Joe's
jeans website, what you do

154
00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.160
is you'll see a little
button that says, take your

155
00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.680
fit quiz. And then you
can take the code quiz

156
00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:28.870
right on the Joe's jeans
website, and then you press

157
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:31.480
shop now. And that whole
experience, it's now personalized for

158
00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:35.410
you. Oh, okay. So they
don't even have to, to

159
00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:38.980
'em as Joe's jeans, doesn't
have to implement anything. They're

160
00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:42.610
getting your, your quiz and
your, and that, and that

161
00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:45.400
number built in automatically on
their website. Exactly. And you

162
00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.260
don't have to go to
<inaudible> dot com. So our,

163
00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:49.060
you know, our whole thing
is we want to leave

164
00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:51.430
the customers right on our
partner websites. We don't want

165
00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:53.800
to pull them away for
anything. We just want the

166
00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.390
customer to be able to
stay right on the Joe's

167
00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:58.750
gene site and shop successfully
right there. That's interesting. Now,

168
00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:01.420
as, as someone who has
a company that you're promoting

169
00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:04.660
and that you're talking about
though, doesn't by allowing them

170
00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:07.660
to, to integrate like that
doesn't that downplay the fit

171
00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:10.330
code site, or are you
trying to do that? And

172
00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:11.740
you really want to make
it about the brand that

173
00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:14.110
the person likes. Yeah. We
really want to make it

174
00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:16.810
about the brand. So when
I first started fit code,

175
00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:19.510
we had to fit code.com.
And that's really where we

176
00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:21.850
gathered our information. It was
where we tested and what's

177
00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:24.430
where we tried new things
and, you know, or able

178
00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:25.840
to see if they worked
or not. So if it

179
00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:28.750
covid.com is a place where
our customers can still go

180
00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:31.240
and you can shop across
all sorts of brands. But

181
00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.790
we started realizing that, you
know, the world doesn't need

182
00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:36.670
another marketplace. What they need
is they need the experiences

183
00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:38.620
where they're comfortable, which is
on a brand of retail

184
00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:41.500
website, just to be easier.
So if we could figure

185
00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:43.330
out a way to do
that, we could be successful.

186
00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:46.660
And that's why we switched
to JavaScript. Oh, interesting. Okay.

187
00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:49.930
So before you were doing
something other than Jarvis, Yeah.

188
00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:52.810
When we first started, we
actually did a plugin. So

189
00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:55.590
a browser plugin. So the
whole idea that you could

190
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:59.730
take your fit code, shopping,
wherever you went. And again,

191
00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:01.950
we just realized that that
was a bit too technical

192
00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:03.660
and we didn't need to
do that. So let's just

193
00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:06.480
integrate right onto the partner
website. Let's make it seamless

194
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:10.250
and that's been successful for
us so far. Interesting. Okay.

195
00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:12.890
So I'm here. I'm just,
while we're talking, I went

196
00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:15.560
over to Joe's jeans.com, which
is one of the partner

197
00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:19.190
websites and went looking and
then there's a badge. It

198
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:23.270
looks like a black circle
with a stylized FSC. And

199
00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:25.880
it says seven 10, which
is the code number that

200
00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:28.850
my wife got. And it
says here, perfect fit found

201
00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:31.400
this style has been fit,
tested, and approved for fit

202
00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:34.910
code seven 10. How are
you measuring these? When I

203
00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:36.980
think of jeans again, I
think of waste. And I

204
00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:40.970
think of inseam, are you
a, I don't know, finding

205
00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:42.740
seven, 10 people and they
all go try the pants

206
00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:44.840
on or how is there
something more technical behind it?

207
00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:49.010
Yeah. You know, there is,
there's definitely, definitely more technical

208
00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:51.380
answers behind that. But the
big thing is our founding

209
00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:53.750
principle that you can have
a bunch of women who

210
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:55.970
wear the exact same size
and they can be totally

211
00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:58.880
different body shapes. So what
we do to make sure

212
00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.740
that, you know, we're telling
your wife that that's the

213
00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:03.500
right Joe's jeans for her,
is that we actually fit

214
00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:05.630
test all the genes. So
our partners send us their

215
00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:08.360
entire inventory. We have in
our office. It's awesome. And

216
00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:10.520
we call it the denim
cave because we just have

217
00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:13.220
hundreds and hundreds of genes.
But what we do is

218
00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:15.680
we bring in women all
of the same size, but

219
00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:18.140
all different body shapes. And
they try on every single

220
00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:20.150
pair of jeans. So we
can see how that gene

221
00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:22.880
is going to fit across
all body shapes. We then

222
00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:25.610
marry that to a beautiful
technical process where we have

223
00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:28.160
all the measurements that are
standardized and we know how

224
00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:29.810
these things are going to
map to fit codes. And

225
00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:31.760
then that's how we spit
out the recommendations for our

226
00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.430
customers. I see. And the
fit code is the secret

227
00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:36.500
sauce that I can, I
can know that if I

228
00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:38.030
have that number, then I'm
going to get a pair

229
00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:41.270
of pants that fit me.
Exactly. So you're talking about

230
00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:43.430
jeans right now, but it
seems like this could scale

231
00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:46.160
to other things like know
shirts. I always have that

232
00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.860
trouble where I'm at. If
you've ever seen someone like

233
00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:50.690
a man wearing a shirt
and you say that's a

234
00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:55.430
medium, right, absolutely. I'm in
that awkward. Like I need

235
00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:57.170
a medium, that's not a
large cause a large as

236
00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:59.930
a poncho and a medium
for me as this medium,

237
00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:02.600
this, this fit code could
go to other, other clothing.

238
00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.960
Couldn't it? Not just jeans.
Absolutely could. So we're going

239
00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.540
to men's denim next, just
because that's what we've tested

240
00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:10.220
and we have built out,
but then we have other

241
00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:13.430
apparel I'm already built into
the algorithm so we can

242
00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:16.970
go there next year. Very
cool. Okay. So what is

243
00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:19.640
the backend? I understand. And
this is a coincidence, by

244
00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.680
the way. I, I, I
tend to work at Microsoft,

245
00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.050
but I understand that you
have some Microsoft tools in

246
00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:26.690
the backend as well. Yeah.
So we collect a lot

247
00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:29.960
of data and so we
need to have pretty powerful

248
00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:32.120
tools to build, to look
at that data and figure

249
00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:33.950
out what to do with
it. So the biggest piece

250
00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:35.720
about the FICO data is
we want to make sure

251
00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:39.770
everything's very actionable. So we're
collecting data, not only from

252
00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:42.020
our customers, but from our
partner sites. So we know

253
00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:44.690
how customers are engaging in
it, how they're converting, which

254
00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:47.570
is our biggest success metric.
And then we need to

255
00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:50.210
be able to serve all
this back to our partners

256
00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:53.890
in an actionable and insightful
way. So you've got thousands

257
00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:56.620
of users, Thousands of genes,
thousands of measurements. And you're

258
00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:57.820
going to have to go
and put all of that

259
00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:00.520
in, in the backend and
manage all that data. That's

260
00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:04.600
cool. Now I'm looking at
your LinkedIn and it looks

261
00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:07.210
like you've been the CEO
of fit code for three

262
00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:09.520
years, but you were, or
I assume that you, are

263
00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.440
you still a working model?
It looks like you worked

264
00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:13.650
as a model for at
least eight years. Yeah. I'm

265
00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:16.110
still a working model. I'm
taking less jobs now, as

266
00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:19.500
this company has gotten busier
and busier, but I still

267
00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:23.340
do shoot here and there
Maybe very, very briefly. You

268
00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:26.070
could explain that, that term
working model. Cause I have

269
00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:29.550
friends that are working models
that do you know, I

270
00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:32.400
have a great friend who
does Amazon shots so that

271
00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:34.470
when you look on Amazon
and you see the clothing,

272
00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:38.010
that's my friend. And, but
that's, that's different than runway

273
00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:42.000
work. That's different than print
work, et cetera. Yeah, absolutely.

274
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.880
So I was your friend
for a few years. I

275
00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:47.610
shot Amazon when they were
still located in Seattle. Their

276
00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:50.610
photo studio is based in
Seattle now it's not, but

277
00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:52.950
I shot for them, you
know, Monday through Friday of

278
00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:55.680
most weeks. And so a
work in model when we

279
00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:58.740
say that it's means that
you're usually doing commercial work.

280
00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:01.950
So you're doing work for
all these e-commerce companies, you

281
00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:04.080
know, for years. And one
of the reasons why I

282
00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:10.020
started@greatcodewasiwasthosetwolegsyousawonnordstrom.com. So all of those
jeans, I was shooting them.

283
00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:13.080
So I got this really
unique behind the scenes experience

284
00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:16.620
and view of what's going
wrong here. You know, what

285
00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:19.110
people are seeing in these
e-commerce photos and what the

286
00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:20.970
companies are trying to sell,
you know, they're just not

287
00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:23.640
lining up. So that's why,
you know, I found it

288
00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:26.100
fit code, but back to
the work model piece, it

289
00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:28.620
really just means that, you
know, it's our way, it's

290
00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:30.480
our bread and butter. It's
our way of taking home

291
00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:33.030
money. And we don't just
do runways here and there.

292
00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:36.990
It really is our full
time job. Interesting. Okay. But

293
00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:39.060
it sounds, it sounds like
you have a, at least

294
00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:42.750
an understanding and a, and
an acknowledgement that the, the

295
00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:46.080
kind of prototypical model's shape
isn't necessarily the shape of

296
00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:49.590
regular people and it's, that
is shown on fit code.com.

297
00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:53.010
You have normal looking people
of all sizes, both thin

298
00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:55.080
and not so with it.
Yeah. This is something that

299
00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:58.200
I'm pretty passionate about. So
the main reason I founded

300
00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:00.060
fit code would be was
because I would be at

301
00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:02.700
these shoots and I was
a size 27 and they'd

302
00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.280
have one other size 27
girl. And they would try

303
00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:08.220
the jeans on us and
whoever they fit, they would

304
00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:11.010
shoot in them. And I
started realizing that, you know,

305
00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:13.380
we have to look beyond
size and this is it

306
00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:15.570
right here is that you
can have two girls the

307
00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:17.850
same size and the jeans
look completely different on each

308
00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:20.310
of them. So how do
we just take, you know,

309
00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:22.710
the, the size question out
of the equation and how

310
00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:24.420
do we just look at
a woman's body shape and

311
00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:27.120
say, Hey, we're not here
to judge anything. Size is

312
00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:29.070
just size. It's just a
number we don't care. Let's

313
00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:30.900
look at your body shape.
Let's figure out what genes

314
00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:32.790
are going to really fit
you and really flatter you.

315
00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:36.690
Okay. So then I assume
that there was some point

316
00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:39.570
where you had that aha
moment, right? You're you're at

317
00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:42.030
Yano, you're at Chili's afterwards
after a long day of

318
00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:43.680
shooting and you're sitting there
with a napkin and you're

319
00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:45.030
like, I think I have
an idea here. I'm going

320
00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:48.450
to make an index number.
That's not like a big

321
00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:49.890
number. It doesn't mean a
big person. I'm going to

322
00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:52.430
make a whole new way
to size things. Was there

323
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:54.560
a napkin? Was there, were
you there with a partner?

324
00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:58.240
Yeah. You know, there were,
there were many napkins. So

325
00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:00.400
I think anyone that's creative
product knows that it's never

326
00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:03.010
just one napkin, one napkin
sets you on that path,

327
00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:05.350
but then you have so
many iterations of your product.

328
00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:08.290
And there was the aha
moment for me. And for

329
00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:11.230
me, it was a little
different. It was not that

330
00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:13.750
I knew that we needed
this product because I knew

331
00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:15.370
we needed it. I knew
this was a problem. And

332
00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:17.110
I knew I had a
very unique place to solve

333
00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:20.020
it from, but it was
really that fear of, Hey,

334
00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:21.880
if I don't do this,
someone else is going to,

335
00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:24.670
and I'm passionate about solving
for women. And so if

336
00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:27.400
I can be a woman
solving for women, I can,

337
00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:31.270
I understand the product. I
understand the, you know, all

338
00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:33.160
the things that go into
denim and go into making

339
00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:35.080
them look good. So I
think I'm in a unique

340
00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:37.360
place to solve this. And,
you know, I didn't, I

341
00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:40.570
didn't want to miss out
on that. Are you a

342
00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.570
technical cofounder or a non
technical founder? I'm a non

343
00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:46.690
tactical cofounder. So both my
cofounder and I did not

344
00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:49.990
come from a technology background.
I'm one of the first

345
00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:52.450
people I brought on our
board member was technical. And

346
00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:55.240
he really helped me build
out that technology side of

347
00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:57.220
our business, which is most
of our business at this

348
00:15:57.220 --> 00:16:01.360
point. And has that been
something where you have to

349
00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:04.300
decide how technical you want
to be, or do you

350
00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:06.700
have to consciously say, all
right, I understand how this

351
00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:08.500
JavaScript works, but that's as
far as I need to

352
00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:11.110
go, because I'm going to
focus on CEO stuff and

353
00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:15.340
not CTO stuff. Yeah. You
know, I think there's an

354
00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:17.590
interesting place. And I think
anyone who's been the CEO

355
00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:20.050
or leadership in a company
knows the difference between working

356
00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:22.360
on the business and working
in the business. And I

357
00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:24.520
work in the business just
enough to make sure that

358
00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:26.200
we are going the direction
that I know we need

359
00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:28.570
to go, but I'm a
big, big fan of letting

360
00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:31.480
experts be experts. And I
didn't bring on my developers

361
00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:33.700
so that I can micromanage
them because I'm not qualified

362
00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:35.650
to do that. You know,
the people who I bring

363
00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:37.540
on in this company are
people who I trust and

364
00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:39.280
I trust that they're going
to get the job done

365
00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:42.340
and get it done really
well. And, you know, if

366
00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:43.990
I was there trying to
tell him what to do,

367
00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:45.790
then they're going to try
to do it one way

368
00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:47.950
and they don't get to
use their creativity. So I,

369
00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:49.990
you know, really pretty hands
off with my team and

370
00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:51.610
I let them be creative
and try to figure out

371
00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:54.940
the most agile and creative
solutions to these problems. So

372
00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:58.180
you express the vision and
they can present to you.

373
00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:00.400
Like you say, well, we
can do it with a

374
00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:01.810
plugin and we can do
it with JavaScript. We can

375
00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:03.580
do an, a back end
integration. And then how do

376
00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:05.530
you make decision about which
of those things do, because

377
00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:06.880
you could have integrated a
lot of this in a

378
00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:10.330
backend as web APIs. Yeah,
absolutely. You know, I come

379
00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:12.280
from the business and the
consumer point of view. So

380
00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:14.350
when they present me with
all these issues, I always

381
00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:17.350
are different, you know, solutions.
I always say, Hey, let's

382
00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:19.330
bring it back to the
customer. What does the customer

383
00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:21.940
want to use? I'm I'm
the consumer? Am I going

384
00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:23.680
to use this? If the
answer is no, then let's

385
00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:25.990
pivot, let's go to a
different direction. And then the

386
00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:27.730
other thing that I really
think of is what is

387
00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:30.400
the marketplace calling for? So
I'm the one that's out

388
00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:32.950
talking to these brands, I'm
talking to these retailers and

389
00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:34.870
I'm, you know, I have
to listen to what their

390
00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:36.670
pain points are. And so
I bring that back to

391
00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:38.860
the team and I say,
Hey, you know, this, this

392
00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:41.740
solution you have is really
technical. And it's really, really

393
00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:44.740
cool, but it's not needed
right now. So let's table

394
00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:46.300
it. Let's put it in
the back burner and let's

395
00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:48.250
get these partners what they
need right now. And what's

396
00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:52.770
what their pain are. How
far along were you before

397
00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:56.680
you started looking for a
investment, did you have a

398
00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:00.270
minimally viable product, an MVP,
or did you have the

399
00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:02.630
whole thing ready to go?
You know, it was really

400
00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:05.540
just a, it was just
an idea that I had

401
00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:08.990
when I went out and
got investments. So we needed

402
00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:11.690
investment in order to build
a product at all because

403
00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:14.960
it was technical. And so
I had to get investment

404
00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:17.540
basically from day two. So
I talked to a lot

405
00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:20.660
of people about this idea.
It was an interesting road

406
00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:24.050
for me because it was
a very, very clear problem.

407
00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:26.780
So people could understand the
problem, not only from the

408
00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:29.870
business perspective, but they also
it's personal to them. You

409
00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:32.330
know, whether you're a man
or a woman, you understand

410
00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:35.270
how hard shopping online can
be and you get that,

411
00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:37.430
you get that, you know,
we can make this easier.

412
00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:39.830
So for me, all I
had to do is say,

413
00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:42.650
Hey, this is a very,
very big problem returns account

414
00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:46.640
for billions of dollars each
year for retail companies. And,

415
00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:48.500
you know, we also understand
how it is to be

416
00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:50.540
a consumer and how hard
it is to shop online.

417
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:53.600
That is an interesting point.
I mean, some people may

418
00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:56.900
have be halfway into this
podcast and wondering like, why

419
00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:58.940
does this matter? Maybe they're
not interested in fashion or

420
00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:02.240
they're not interested in pants.
I am, but they might,

421
00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:04.370
but now you just, you
just kind of crystallize it

422
00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:08.420
for me returns, right? You're
buying a $80 pair of

423
00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:11.060
jeans or a $30 pair
of jeans and $68 of

424
00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:12.650
that may be shipping it.
And if I have to

425
00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:14.930
ship it back then a
human has to open the

426
00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:16.790
box and deal with the
box and make sure that

427
00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:19.700
the jeans are still sellable
or appropriate. And if you

428
00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:22.610
have to throw those away,
then you're losing money because

429
00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:24.890
all that money comes out
of the profit for X

430
00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:26.810
number of other genes. So
it sounds like returns are

431
00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:29.240
the problem that you're solving
here as well as conversion.

432
00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:31.580
Yeah. So the first thing
we do is we want

433
00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:33.710
people to be comfortable shopping
online. So we have to

434
00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:36.350
look at those conversion rates,
does this product work to

435
00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:38.780
get people to purchase? And
then from there, of course,

436
00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:41.450
it's, are they returning less?
So going into this, we

437
00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:45.350
know that women specifically shopping
for denim online return over

438
00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:47.810
50% of the jeans that
they purchase. So how do

439
00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:52.430
we cut into that 50%?
Yes. Oh, that's really bad.

440
00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:54.920
I've heard nightmare stories. I
was actually at a party

441
00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:58.520
recently where someone was telling
me how their spouse abused

442
00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:01.880
Zappos. And I felt really
bad for Zappos. I was

443
00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:04.940
like, they buy 12 pairs
of shoes and they send

444
00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:08.330
10 back. I mean, that's
really not cool. It's really

445
00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:10.610
bad, but this is what
these companies have to do

446
00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:12.830
in order to compete. So
they have to offer these

447
00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:15.590
free returns and they have
to, you know, basically be

448
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:17.780
a try on service. It's
what they've turned into. And

449
00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:20.210
so, you know, just like
your friend in her shoes,

450
00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:22.670
it's the same thing with
denim. People buy four pairs

451
00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:24.830
and return three and just
Skino keep the one that

452
00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:27.500
fits. So how do we
get, how do we cut

453
00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:29.240
into that? How do we
get women to only buy

454
00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:31.010
two and know that those
two are going to fit

455
00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:34.310
and that that's where fit
code comes in. And it

456
00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:37.550
sounds like you're keeping metrics
because you're saying that consumers

457
00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:40.040
are three to four times
more likely to convert. Once

458
00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:42.650
they've got this fit code,
they've internalized it. And they

459
00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:45.350
start shopping with that code
rather than with them. Yeah,

460
00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:48.340
absolutely. So that's our biggest,
so our partners want to

461
00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:50.980
sell more jeans. And so
if we can get their

462
00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:53.740
customers to buy more genes,
that's, that's the number one

463
00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:55.690
thing. And so the number
one thing we report on

464
00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:58.660
is conversions. So just like
you said, we've seen that

465
00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:00.970
with fit code, their customers
are shopping at three to

466
00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:04.390
four times the rate. So
a conversion rate in e-commerce

467
00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:07.570
a standard conversion rate is
2% meaning that 2% of

468
00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:10.240
people who go to a
website like Nordstrom are going

469
00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.550
to actually purchase something. So
how do we get that

470
00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:14.440
higher will fit code does.
So if we have a

471
00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:17.710
three to four times multiplier,
that means they're shopping anywhere

472
00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:20.680
from six to 8% instead
of 2%. And that's, that's

473
00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:25.350
big dollars for these companies.
Yeah. You were a working

474
00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:28.320
model for eight years, plus
continue to be your CEO

475
00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:30.660
now, but with all the
respect. And I say this

476
00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:33.090
as someone who is not
familiar with how modeling works,

477
00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:36.360
I think of modeling as
being a, a singular thing.

478
00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:39.390
It's an individual thing. I,
you know, you, you're in

479
00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:42.090
the show, if you're a,
for example, a walkout walking

480
00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:44.910
model or a runway model
rather, or if you are

481
00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:48.750
part of a campaign, you're
not giving creative feedback on

482
00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:52.250
the campaign, I assume, but
when you're a CEO, you're,

483
00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:54.900
you're flipping that you're in
charge. You make the statements,

484
00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:58.530
you make the vision. How
does eight years of modeling

485
00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:02.850
experience as a singular individual
translate into CEO type work?

486
00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:05.550
You know, I think it
was eight years of being

487
00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:08.130
frustrated that I was hearing
a problem that I knew

488
00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:11.190
I could solve and wasn't
being asked to help. And

489
00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:13.590
that was a really, really
powerful place for me to

490
00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:16.290
come from. So, you know,
you talk to models and

491
00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:18.420
the one thing you'll hear
over and over is that,

492
00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:20.820
you know, we're just considered
a clothes hanger. And at

493
00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:22.620
the end of the day
we are, and that's fine.

494
00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:24.870
You know, like that's the
job we got into and

495
00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:26.760
you get paid for it.
I don't think it is

496
00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:29.520
fine. Well, it's not fine,
but you know, that's fine.

497
00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:33.300
You're not mistreated, but you're
also not, you're not valued

498
00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:37.140
for your problem solving ability
because that's not why they

499
00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:39.180
hired you. They hired you
to make clothes look good.

500
00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:41.820
And so for eight years,
I listened to this problem

501
00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:44.220
and I looked, and I'd
listened to the retailers who

502
00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:47.250
are offset complaining about return
rates and complain about the

503
00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:50.160
state of the industry. And
so for me, while modeling,

504
00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:54.030
you know, certainly wasn't business
school, it was this really,

505
00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:57.750
really beautiful lesson. And here's
a problem that has dollars

506
00:22:57.750 --> 00:23:00.870
tied to it. I have
a solution and going into

507
00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:03.720
being a CEO from being
a model, it was the

508
00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:06.240
coolest place because for a
year, as I had been

509
00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:09.540
criticized and critiqued on things
I couldn't control, which was

510
00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:11.970
things, you know, like how
you look and how, what

511
00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:14.400
your appearance is. And suddenly
as a CEO, I could

512
00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:18.900
say, Hey, anything, that's going
wrong in this product. I

513
00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:21.450
can change. I have the
ability to change. And it

514
00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:24.240
was awesome. It still is
awesome to say, you know,

515
00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:27.330
anything that I'm being criticized
for now is just on

516
00:23:27.330 --> 00:23:29.130
the product. And that means
I'm not doing a good

517
00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:31.410
enough job listening to my
customers or to my partners

518
00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:33.210
and all of those things
I can change. So it's

519
00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:38.040
very, very empowering. Where else
did you pull your leadership

520
00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:41.010
kind of inspiration from, because
there's your experience as a

521
00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:43.740
model, which gives you the
problem space, the understanding of

522
00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:46.340
the problem space. If I
understand correctly, when I did

523
00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:49.610
research on you, were you
in fact, an NCAA athlete

524
00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:52.720
as well? I was, I
swam for the university of

525
00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:56.080
Washington as a varsity athlete
there. And I think I

526
00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:58.690
got a lot of leadership
from sports as well. So

527
00:23:58.690 --> 00:24:02.140
I was an athlete my
entire life. I've never shied

528
00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:04.300
away from hard work, which
I think is really important

529
00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:06.130
as a CEO and also
as a CEO of a

530
00:24:06.130 --> 00:24:11.110
startup. But, you know, I
value dedication. I value commitment

531
00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:14.170
and I'm not afraid of
little pain and having to

532
00:24:14.170 --> 00:24:18.610
grind. And that's what athletics
taught me. Well, that's an

533
00:24:18.610 --> 00:24:21.100
interesting point you bring up.
So people talk about, and

534
00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:23.260
there's a lot of discussion
about this on Twitter, about

535
00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:25.600
the startup lifestyle. And, you
know, if you don't put

536
00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:29.080
110%, don't even bother showing
up and the idea of

537
00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:31.720
work life balance and whether
or not, you know, the

538
00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:34.150
grind is an appropriate thing.
I'm assuming when you go

539
00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:38.470
and do startup lifestyle, you,
you know, you eat, live,

540
00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:42.850
breathe your company, but personal
stuff also happens that can

541
00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:44.770
throw you for a loop
in the middle of it

542
00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:48.520
and really change your perspective
on your priorities. Yeah, absolutely.

543
00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:52.080
So, you know, the first
year I think that fit

544
00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:55.090
code was live. I not
only got married, but my

545
00:24:55.090 --> 00:24:58.270
mom also passed away from
breast cancer and it was

546
00:24:58.270 --> 00:25:02.440
this really tough time, but
it was also a moment

547
00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:05.440
of clarity for me where,
you know, you read about,

548
00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:07.810
and you hear from other
founders about how stressful and

549
00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:10.330
how hard startup life can
be, because it's just has

550
00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:13.990
an immense amount of pressure.
But I did that in

551
00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:16.510
tandem with taking care of
my sick mom. And I

552
00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:20.740
realized that every single stress
I felt during working hours,

553
00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:23.710
that was a privilege because
that's not real stress, that's

554
00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:26.830
a stress that's not happening
to you. You've chosen it.

555
00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:29.080
Right. I chose to be
a founder. I chose to

556
00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:31.480
be the CEO of a
startup. So therefore I can't

557
00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:33.610
complain about these hours. I
can't complain about the stress

558
00:25:33.610 --> 00:25:35.860
because these are choices. You
know, what was happening to

559
00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:38.020
my mom was not a
choice and that's real stress.

560
00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:42.220
So having that perspective, going
into being a CEO of

561
00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:45.130
a startup was just invaluable
for me. And, you know,

562
00:25:45.130 --> 00:25:48.220
I think about it almost
every day is, Hey, don't

563
00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:50.800
complain, you chose this, anything
that's happening right now, these

564
00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:53.170
are choices. And this is
a really, really fun process.

565
00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:56.200
And you have to embrace
it. That is a really

566
00:25:56.200 --> 00:26:00.190
interesting balance to find between
the stresses that you chose,

567
00:26:00.370 --> 00:26:03.760
the, the, the stresses you
did, not the privileges that

568
00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:06.910
you have, the privileges that
you don't and trying to

569
00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:09.910
be, you know, not necessarily
responsible for everything that happens

570
00:26:09.910 --> 00:26:11.650
to you, but accountable for
the things that happened to

571
00:26:11.650 --> 00:26:14.980
you. Yeah, absolutely. And I
think it's also just the

572
00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:18.580
perspective and understanding that that's
never going to end. So,

573
00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:21.460
you know, going back to
funding, you can get millions

574
00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:23.410
of dollars in funding and
think that that's going to

575
00:26:23.410 --> 00:26:26.200
end your stress, but that
just means that you're scaling

576
00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:28.330
your business and with that
comes more stress and more

577
00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:31.240
problems. So it's really about
to pay that money back

578
00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:34.360
to me. Exactly. Like, you
know, that's something, again that

579
00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:38.080
I'm passionate about is investment
is debt. And, you know,

580
00:26:38.290 --> 00:26:42.010
anyone that I hear that's
going through different investment phases,

581
00:26:42.010 --> 00:26:44.310
I always remind them of
like, don't get addicted to

582
00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:47.580
the cash. This is debt,
you know, be cashflow positive,

583
00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:50.220
get addicted to the drive
to be cashflow positive because

584
00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:53.430
that's where your power comes
from. Don't forget that investment

585
00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:57.690
is still debt. So yeah.
So those stresses, all that

586
00:26:57.690 --> 00:26:59.880
kind of thing. It's just
about perspective and realizing that

587
00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:01.560
they're always going to be
there. You just have to

588
00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:04.860
learn to mitigate them and
learn how to appreciate them.

589
00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:08.300
Yeah. I think it's really
easy to be an armchair

590
00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:11.510
quarterback and a person on
Twitter saying, Oh, wow, Ryan

591
00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:15.050
got $3 million in funding. She's
probably driving a fancy car

592
00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:17.210
now, but wait a second,
you have a dozen people

593
00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:19.220
working for you or more.
Now you have a hundred

594
00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:22.550
thousand users. I don't think
that you just get like

595
00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:25.310
a big pile of gold
coins, right? When you get

596
00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:29.750
your, your, your money. Absolutely
not. And especially as, you

597
00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:32.240
know, founder, we all have
choices of, you know, what

598
00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:35.630
salaries look like. And I've
said all along that, you

599
00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:39.140
know, I pay my employees
first. So they, you know,

600
00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:40.640
I have to pay them
the salaries cause I have

601
00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:42.860
to keep them engaged and
keep them committed. And while

602
00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:45.520
they love the project and
they love the product, I

603
00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:47.150
have to support them. And
they all have families that

604
00:27:47.150 --> 00:27:49.670
they have to support. So
I really come last when

605
00:27:49.670 --> 00:27:51.770
it comes to that. So
anyone that thinks you can

606
00:27:51.770 --> 00:27:53.870
found a startup and in
your first few years, you

607
00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:56.720
know, be bringing home a
lot of money or delusional

608
00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:59.930
because you're not, hopefully the
payoff is there in the

609
00:27:59.930 --> 00:28:02.330
end. But again, for me,
it's never been about the

610
00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:05.180
money it's been about making
this experience better for customers.

611
00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:06.770
And if we do that,
maybe there will be a

612
00:28:06.770 --> 00:28:09.470
payoff, but if not, then
it has been an awesome,

613
00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:13.520
awesome ride. Well, yeah. I
certainly hope that you are

614
00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:17.030
successful in doing that. It's
gotta be overwhelming though, to,

615
00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:21.260
to have this idea and
have the, well, actually, let

616
00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:24.380
me back up, let me
ask you this. It's been

617
00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:27.350
three years now, since you
founded the company, are you

618
00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:29.450
where you thought you'd be
at three years or did

619
00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:31.610
you know that this would
be a multiyear long and

620
00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:36.200
not multi-month long ride? That's
a great question. No one's

621
00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:41.090
ever asked me that. I
didn't know. Yeah. I didn't

622
00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:43.970
know what to think. I
didn't go to business school.

623
00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:46.370
I had never done this
before. I also didn't do

624
00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:48.650
a lot of extensive reading
on startups going into this.

625
00:28:48.650 --> 00:28:51.890
And I did that purposefully
because I just like I

626
00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:54.140
do with my team. I
wanted to have the creativity

627
00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:56.060
to solve this problem the
right way and not be

628
00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:59.240
constrained by the way other
people have done things. So

629
00:28:59.270 --> 00:29:01.400
I had no idea where
I should be at this

630
00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:04.490
point. If, if I could
go back, I think I'd

631
00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:06.560
be really, really proud of
where we are now. You

632
00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:10.190
know, we're becoming a nationally
recognized brand, which is awesome.

633
00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:12.800
We have incoming PR, which
is awesome. We're integrating with

634
00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:15.410
some of the biggest denim
brands in the country. So

635
00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:16.970
I don't think I could
have dreamed that we would

636
00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:20.660
be where we are today,
if not only because of

637
00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:22.910
the success we've had, but
also the direction we've gone.

638
00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:25.550
So we have pivoted so
many times because like I

639
00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:28.460
said, we constantly are listening
to what customers and partners

640
00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:32.120
need. So I couldn't have
predicted that we'd be integrating

641
00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:35.390
right on partner websites using
JavaScript and going to men

642
00:29:35.390 --> 00:29:38.600
so soon. And then also
just having this abundance of

643
00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:41.410
data that is really valuable
for these partners. So I

644
00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:44.970
couldn't predict any of those
things. That's interesting. I didn't

645
00:29:44.970 --> 00:29:47.700
even realize that now that
you're developing this data, the

646
00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:50.310
bigger that, that database and
that the more valuable that

647
00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:54.660
algorithm has that will not
only affect existing inventory and

648
00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:58.740
existing inventory of genes, but
potentially new manufacturing of clothing.

649
00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:02.760
Absolutely. So this has been
a byproduct of fit code,

650
00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:07.020
which again, I didn't predict,
but has been awesome is

651
00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:09.780
that we suddenly have this
customer data that these brands

652
00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:12.420
have never seen before. So
if you think about the

653
00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:14.520
way that a denim brand
makes jeans, they have a

654
00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:18.650
fit model, come in, she's,
you know, maybe five, nine

655
00:30:18.670 --> 00:30:21.180
a size 27, and they
make all their genes off

656
00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:24.120
this one model. And so
suddenly we can go to

657
00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:26.460
these brands and we say,
Hey, since we've integrated on

658
00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:29.400
your site, we now know
by body shape exactly who

659
00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:31.710
your customer base is. We
can break that down by

660
00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:35.430
percentage. So we know that
33% is the shape and

661
00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:38.550
another 20% is the shape.
Let's start making your jeans

662
00:30:38.550 --> 00:30:42.420
to actually fit your customer.
And we hold fit sessions

663
00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:44.880
with our partners, where we
bring real women in their

664
00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:48.210
real customer based body shape.
And, and they get to

665
00:30:48.210 --> 00:30:51.000
try those jeans on, in
the design process now. So

666
00:30:51.450 --> 00:30:53.970
we can say, Hey, this
Gene's working. This Gene's not,

667
00:30:53.970 --> 00:30:56.490
let's increase our rise here
or decrease the back rise

668
00:30:56.490 --> 00:30:59.340
here. And let's really make
sure that we're aligning your

669
00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:02.490
denim for your customer base.
That's interesting. I didn't think

670
00:31:02.490 --> 00:31:05.730
about that demographic data in
that way. This is data

671
00:31:05.730 --> 00:31:08.400
that really is going to
improve people's lives. It's anonymized

672
00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:10.680
data. You don't have to
worry about privacy concerns because

673
00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:13.830
it's really just the demographics
of these are the people

674
00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:15.990
that are buying these jeans
and you should make more

675
00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:19.950
of those. That's a fantastic
bit of insight. Exactly. It

676
00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:21.750
has just been awesome to
be able to consult with

677
00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:24.870
our partners on that. Fantastic.
Well, thank you so much

678
00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:27.990
for chatting with me, Ryan Buckley,
the fit code co founder

679
00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:30.450
and CEO. Thank you so
much, Scott. It's been a

680
00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:34.470
pleasure. This has been another
episode of Hanselminutes and we'll

681
00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:35.760
see you again next week.
