web applications. online@wwwdottelerik.com. In this
episode, Scott talks with Pete

7
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.300
Brown about working remotely. Hi,
this is Scott Cancel one.

8
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.880
And this is another episode
of Hansel minutes. And today

9
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.210
I am talking to a
fellow remote worker, Pete Brown.

10
00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.320
I am remote. You're remote.
How's it going, sir? Going

11
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.210
well, Scott, how are you
doing? What's your bed now?

12
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.480
You are in, I was,
we worked together for a

13
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.190
long time and I still
don't. You're in one of

14
00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.340
the new England States. No,
I'm a little bit further

15
00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.460
South than that. So I
live just right between Washington

16
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.510
DC and Annapolis, Maryland. That's
not new England. No, but

17
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.760
I will cut you some
Slack since here from the

18
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.930
wrong coast. Oh, the wrong
coast. Okay. How long have

19
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.920
you worked for the big
blue monster? So it's been

20
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.260
like a year and a
month, I think. So not

21
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.140
too long. And one of
the things that's significant about

22
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.160
us as Microsoft employees is
that we, and now your

23
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.220
entire team are all remote
workers, which is very unusual.

24
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.750
Microsoft. I wouldn't say isn't
necessarily remote worker hostile, but

25
00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.850
they're definitely not remote worker
friendly. You know, they, they

26
00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.010
don't go out of their
way to hire people remotely,

27
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.410
except for our little group,
which actually did go out

28
00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.010
of its way to get
remote people. How has it

29
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.890
been working for Microsoft remotely?
Like what's the good and

30
00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.510
the bad? Well, the good
is it's, you know, it's

31
00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:06.800
a pretty good gig to
be able to work from

32
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.740
my house and be able
to, you know, still have

33
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.930
all the access to people
on campus and all the

34
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.790
cool stuff that goes along
with being a blue badge.

35
00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.750
The bad is like you
said, folks are not really

36
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.900
set up either mentally or
technically to be able to

37
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.170
handle remote workers. So, you
know, we struggle a lot

38
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.960
with setting up meetings and
blowing time at the beginning

39
00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.880
of meetings to set up
cameras and all the usual

40
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.870
things there. And also just,
you know, scheduling people, not

41
00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.900
realizing that you're three hours
difference for them because not

42
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.140
only are we remote where
on a different coast, right.

43
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.390
So you'll get the meeting
request for eight o'clock at

44
00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.070
night. And you know, I'm
usually trying to get my

45
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.620
kids to bed at that
time and stuff. Yeah. It's

46
00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.990
funny. The thing that you
said about blowing time at

47
00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.290
the beginning of meetings, I've
started to literally pull people

48
00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.530
aside on private emails and
say, listen, if you want

49
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:55.760
me to be in this
meeting, I need you to

50
00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.520
come to the meeting room
five, 10 minutes early, and

51
00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.300
then I'll help out. Cause
it is amazing how you

52
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.110
could seriously blow 15 minutes.
Like it's like the first

53
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.840
time they've ever used video
chat before it just blows

54
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.840
their minds. And since we're
doing, I mean, I'll have,

55
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.990
you know, three or four
meetings in a day. Things

56
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.310
like having multiple microphones, multiple
output devices is, is like

57
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.190
trivial for me to understand.
But for everyone else it's

58
00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.450
it's magic. Yup. And you
know how it is when

59
00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.150
you have like a live
meeting and people can never

60
00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.520
figure out the live meeting
at the beginning. Like I

61
00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.220
think every single live meeting
I've ever attended has 10

62
00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.230
minutes of struggling at the
beginning. And that's kind of

63
00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.050
how every meeting is with
remote guys. Do you blame

64
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.150
live meeting or do you
blame the people? I blame

65
00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.730
the people. Yeah. Yeah. I
don't think it's a technology.

66
00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.950
I think it's just, it's
something that they don't have

67
00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.170
to do every day. So
they don't have kind of

68
00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.120
the muscle memory to remember
all the different things that

69
00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.580
they need to do to
get it set up. Now,

70
00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.400
one thing that really helps
though, is if you get

71
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.100
to know the admins for
the groups, the admins are

72
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.590
such a saving grace for
this because they'll come in

73
00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.450
a couple of minutes early,
like you were saying, set

74
00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.700
it up and make it
so nobody else has to

75
00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.060
work. I think that one
of the things that I'd

76
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.400
like people to remember if
there's anyone who's a Microsoft

77
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.340
employee who is listening or
someone that we meet with

78
00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.270
on a regular basis is
that windows knows about playback

79
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.230
devices and recording devices. And
every time you plug something

80
00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.540
into windows, that's either a
pair of headphones or a

81
00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:27.450
USB Polycomm headset or a
speaker phone or whatever that

82
00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.710
becomes another output device. And
those output devices usually have

83
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.700
associated input devices. And the
number one problem that I've

84
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.510
seen is confusion about where,
what exactly is the microphone

85
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.180
in this case or what
exactly is the speakers in

86
00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.270
this case, right. Windows seven,
got a lot smarter with

87
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.400
that. You could, when you
plug something in it pretty

88
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.190
much assumes that the thing
that you just plugged in

89
00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.320
is probably the thing you
want your sound to come

90
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.020
out of. Yeah. I've had
pretty good luck with that

91
00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.810
here. And you know, it
gets a little bit more

92
00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.350
complicated in the offices though,
because we've got those round

93
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.680
table devices and folks are,
you know, figure out how

94
00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.860
to interface with those. And
they're extremely cool once they,

95
00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:09.720
once everybody gets them up
and working. But if you

96
00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.880
don't have experience with them,
those can be pretty challenging.

97
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.060
Maybe you could say something
about what around table devices

98
00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.100
and why they're so important
to us as remote workers.

99
00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.670
Yeah. So the round tables
We're getting, I think in

100
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.550
most of the offices now,
it's, it's actually getting hard

101
00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.470
to find offices up on
campus that don't have a

102
00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.650
round table in it, but
they're a little like stick

103
00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.080
in the middle with this
kind of puck on top.

104
00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.440
And as I understand it,
that that puck has kind

105
00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.710
of CCDs, you know, like
cameras in 360 degrees, just

106
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.950
like a continuous sensor array,
like going around it. And

107
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.160
actually There's five individual webcams.
Is that how it works?

108
00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:46.380
It has five individual webcams
and then it stitches them

109
00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:50.220
together with software. Yeah. It's
a really amazing job of

110
00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:53.610
zeroing in on who's actually
speaking and showing you just

111
00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:55.470
that person as well as
giving you kind of a

112
00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.220
Panorama view of the whole
room. Right? So for, for

113
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.220
a remote worker, it's awesome.
Cause you feel like you're

114
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.440
about as close as you
can be to actually sitting

115
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.390
in the room without, you
know, putting, you're putting a

116
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:08.080
proxy in the room for
you. Right. What's best. What's

117
00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.080
great about the, the round
tables that a lot of

118
00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.700
people don't realize, at least
a lot of people who

119
00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.890
are using them for the
first time is that you

120
00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:17.230
can just plug them in
and you have the drivers

121
00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:20.260
already. If you have windows
seven, you plug them in

122
00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.660
and you don't even need
live meeting. You could literally

123
00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:26.050
plug in a around table
device into your laptop and

124
00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:29.440
use Skype. And rather than
showing a Panorama, like you

125
00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.660
said, it will single in
on the person who is

126
00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:35.830
speaking and then make that
person centered within a square

127
00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:38.890
kind of virtual webcam. So
what we see as the

128
00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:43.360
remote workers are as if
there's like a hidden director

129
00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.880
who is saying camera one,
okay, camera three. Okay. Camera

130
00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.600
two. And picking the correct
webcam view out of the

131
00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.930
360 degrees and then giving
it to us. So we

132
00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:54.940
actually see one of two
things. We either see a

133
00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:59.140
straight square shot of whoever
is speaking or the last

134
00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:02.050
person who has, has spoken,
or if you're using live

135
00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:05.140
meeting or the new Microsoft
link link is spelled L

136
00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:09.730
Y N C, then we'll
actually see a 360 degree

137
00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:13.360
Panorama, like you mentioned. Right.
And it really does help

138
00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.540
from my side. The downside
to those is it's one

139
00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:18.970
way. Right? So you don't
get the little kind of

140
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.860
helped me OB one projection
in the middle of the

141
00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.890
room showing you there. Somebody
has to go through an

142
00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:26.050
extra step to get you
up on a screen or

143
00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:28.870
project a project, your image
up there. Right. Right. And

144
00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:31.390
then you ended up with
the, which is the creepy

145
00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:36.040
10 foot head problem. Sometimes
people will go, Oh wow.

146
00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.960
I don't like that at
all. And then you find

147
00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:41.350
that it's because your giant
face is on the screen.

148
00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:43.870
So what I've been doing
is encouraging people to make

149
00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:46.630
a little small window set
the window to always on

150
00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:49.570
top and then keep me
kind of in the corner.

151
00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:52.120
It's, it's amazing. You would
think it would not be

152
00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.090
obvious to me. You think
it would be obvious, but

153
00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:58.870
having your face be the
size that your face would

154
00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:03.100
be if you were there
in person, helps people connect

155
00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:05.470
to you as a remote
worker, like a mom on

156
00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:09.850
an emotional level. Yup. I
totally want the, the Jedi

157
00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:11.800
council chamber thing. You know,
we can have half the

158
00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:14.440
people in holograms, but they're
still sitting in seats. And

159
00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:17.260
so it just looks like
they're there they're life size.

160
00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:20.470
I think that would be
the ultimate, the ultimate way

161
00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:23.920
to go about it. Apparently
the Cisco telepresence is close

162
00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:27.430
to that. Basically they take
a big round table and

163
00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:32.110
then they wrap 40 inch
or 50 inch screens, one,

164
00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:35.350
two, three across one half
of it. So there's effectively

165
00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:39.400
two tables. Each of them
round in two different locations

166
00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:44.080
each with half of the
table backed with screens. So

167
00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:46.090
then you, you look over
to that side and it

168
00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:48.670
looks like they're there. So
that's kind of half optical

169
00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:52.660
illusion and half a 10
AP high, highly compressed video.

170
00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:56.550
That's cool. Are, could do
the, what was it the

171
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:59.430
first, the first Superman where
they had all the guys

172
00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:01.950
projected up on the walls.
Like it's super life-size. That

173
00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:05.480
could be better. Actually. There's
a company now called Lifesize,

174
00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:09.110
which is a division of
logic tech and Lifesize is

175
00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:12.920
competing in the telepresence space
and they've got multiple versions

176
00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:15.650
of their life size software
that is all 10 80

177
00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:19.490
P 30 frames, a second
or seven 20 P 60

178
00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:23.900
frames, a second hardware compressed
video and a various sizes.

179
00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:27.950
And they've got like the
life, the life size executive,

180
00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:30.080
and they've got the life-size
express and all these different

181
00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:35.420
kinds of life size things
we know. And I, I

182
00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:41.420
just recently got a 42
inch screen since LCDs and

183
00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:45.380
big television sets have become
cheaper. Kind of getting back

184
00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:49.610
to that issue about the
head size. You know, we

185
00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:52.940
actually thought about flipping it
on its side, you know,

186
00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:54.860
maybe a 40 inch or
a 50 and something that

187
00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:58.520
would at least make me
almost human sized. You could

188
00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:02.780
have me sitting up, you
basically take a monitor, rotate

189
00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:05.420
it and then put a
chair behind it. And you

190
00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:08.510
can maybe simulate someone sitting
in a chair. And it

191
00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:10.940
sounds very geeky, but again,
all of the, the goal

192
00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:13.640
here and I'm interested in
your opinion, the goal here

193
00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:18.650
is to help people in
Seattle, in our case, connect

194
00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:20.540
with us on a more
emotional level so that we

195
00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:22.550
feel more like a team
and that they think about

196
00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:26.780
us, the out of sight
out of mind kind of

197
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:30.350
phenomenon is a huge problem.
Yeah. Yeah. And what you're

198
00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:34.640
saying about being Lifesize is
it's amazing how kind of

199
00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:37.640
like psychologically, how we, how
we interact with those types

200
00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:40.730
of, of, of interfaces. Like,
like, you know, when you

201
00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:43.160
have a webcam and you're
kind of looking down at

202
00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.740
the laptop webcam, and everybody
else sees you and you're

203
00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:47.930
like hovering over them and
that's kind of a Tim

204
00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:51.230
kind of intimidating it is.
But if, but if you

205
00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:54.500
have just a normal flat
life person in the room,

206
00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:56.840
then that's somebody that you
can relate with. I mean,

207
00:10:57.130 --> 00:10:59.360
the worst end of the
spectrum is a conference call

208
00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:01.970
with no video or half,
half the people just check

209
00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:05.360
out and nobody's really paying
attention. I hope that's not

210
00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:08.420
news to anybody. Yeah. But
also they have a tendency

211
00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:11.090
to, I know this because
I've heard afterwards, you'll say

212
00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:15.170
something you, the remote worker
and the people who are

213
00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:19.070
local will roll their eyes
because you said something stupid.

214
00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:22.310
So what's significant about that
is not, well, maybe it's

215
00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:24.830
significant that I'm an idiot
and they hate me. But

216
00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:27.800
what I think is more
significant is that they are

217
00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.590
more likely to do something
like that. What would be

218
00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:34.460
considered inappropriate in person, right.
If they know you can't

219
00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:39.710
see them. Yeah. It's, it's,
it's amazing how, as, as

220
00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:43.340
humans, we deal with face
to face interaction versus like

221
00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:47.300
any other type of interaction.
Well, Damien and I, Damien

222
00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:51.380
Edwards have been working on,
on making on this 42

223
00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:54.400
inch screen. And it might
seem overkill to put together

224
00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:57.820
42 in screen, but honestly
it was a $400 Costco

225
00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:59.650
kind of a thing. And
it was half the price

226
00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:03.490
of my 30 inch monitor.
It does 10 ADP HTMI.

227
00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:05.770
So we got this thing
at Costco and we took

228
00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:08.680
it to my office in
Seattle and set it up.

229
00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:11.680
And honestly it could be
bigger. I mean, really you

230
00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:14.230
couldn't, you can't, you couldn't
be too big. And if

231
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:17.650
I could find a projector
that was bright enough, I

232
00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:19.960
think I'd project up against
the whole wall. You know,

233
00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:22.510
that would really cause you
to connect with somebody. I

234
00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:24.430
would Mount it on the
ceiling and I'd project a

235
00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:27.970
hundred inches, but we've got
this 42 inch screen. And

236
00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:32.010
I put together a logic
techs and ontologic tech a,

237
00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:37.210
a Microsoft life cams, cinema
seven 20 PhD webcam. And

238
00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:42.230
then I've also just picked
up a logic tech <inaudible>

239
00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:47.110
HD. And I'm basically testing
these two video cams because

240
00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:51.730
they'll both do seven 20
P high definition. Right. But

241
00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:54.800
they'll do it only with
a quad core processor. You

242
00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:57.250
need that quad core processor.
Otherwise you need to go

243
00:12:57.250 --> 00:13:01.990
in and buy a hardware
compressed camera. That'll, that'll, that'll

244
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:06.460
really squish. Right. And it's
worked so well. And we've

245
00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:09.430
been using it with a
office communicator now called link.

246
00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:12.100
And what's great about it
is that I can switch

247
00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:15.610
from showing myself to showing
my desktop and we've been

248
00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:19.210
doing some, some pairing and
it's, it's worked really, really

249
00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:24.040
well, surprisingly well. And they
really told me that what

250
00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:25.540
we did is we shoved
me actually in the corner.

251
00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:27.610
That way I could see
a complete view of the

252
00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:30.130
room. And they told me
that it's caused them to

253
00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:33.010
connect with me more. So
I've just been doing what

254
00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:35.410
we did before with, with
Phil hack is leave the

255
00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:38.140
camera on all the time
that I'm sitting there so

256
00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:42.430
that somebody can just stop
by my office. And then

257
00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:45.210
I'll just write it. It's
the difference Between, you know,

258
00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:47.730
you actually have a presence
in that room versus somebody

259
00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:50.130
having to go out and
like, if they have to

260
00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:51.990
call you that, it makes
it really obvious that you're

261
00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:53.610
not there. But if you
just walk in the room

262
00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:55.770
and you know, the dude
on the monitor looks up

263
00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:58.290
and says, Hey, how you
doing? Then? You know, you

264
00:13:58.290 --> 00:14:01.920
have a presence in the
room. Hi, this is Scott

265
00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:04.320
coming to you from another
place in time. Are you

266
00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:07.710
using agile practices to manage
your software development? There's lots

267
00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:09.570
of tools in the market
that manage the steps of

268
00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:12.090
a project, but most of
them focus on individual roles,

269
00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:15.000
get ready for a solution
that caters for the success

270
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.030
of the whole team. Guys
at Tellerik introduced team pulse.

271
00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:21.330
It's an agile project management
tool. That'll help you gather

272
00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:26.100
ideas, estimate plan, track progress
in a common workspace. Finally

273
00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:28.410
companies, regardless of their size
can use a lightweight and

274
00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:30.510
convenient tool that makes all
the stakeholders work as a

275

R I K Tellerik. We

284
00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:09.020
do appreciate it. There wouldn't
be a Hansel minutes. If

285
00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:13.850
there wasn't teller helping us.
I recently blogged about a

286
00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:16.220
pan tilt zoom. There's a
thing called a tracker pot.

287
00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:19.610
It's a $20 pan tilt
zoom thing that you plug

288
00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:22.100
in with USB, you know,
about a half an hours

289
00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:24.620
work and I've hooked up
a remote pan tilt zoom.

290
00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:25.790
And this is going to
allow me to look at

291
00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:29.480
the whiteboard or look out
the door. And by looking

292
00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:32.210
at the door, now I
can see people wander by,

293
00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:34.670
right? And then what I
did is I hooked up

294
00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:38.360
a Polycomm a Polycomm is
kind of a standard brand

295
00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:41.990
for conference phones instead of
just using regular speakers and

296
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:44.750
regular mix, that makes the
sound much better. And it

297
00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:47.810
also allows me to shout.
So if someone wanders by,

298
00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:51.080
I can say, Hey, Hey,
come here. You know, and

299
00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:54.380
then they'll, they'll come in.
And well, it's a little

300
00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:56.330
bit of a curiosity. I
mean, sure. It's, it's kind

301
00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:58.640
of strange. You've got this
guy in a, in a

302
00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:03.710
big picture frame. I organize
the office. It was fortunate

303
00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:07.970
enough that my boss was
flexible and organize an office

304
00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:10.910
at the, at the end
of a T junction. So

305
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:13.700
basically you step off the
elevator in building 42, you

306
00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:15.830
turned to the side and
I'm right there. And I

307
00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:17.960
get a lot of foot
traffic. It's probably one of

308
00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:21.680
the most foot traffic offices
out there, which would not

309
00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:23.180
be a good thing if
you were at depth. But

310
00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:25.880
if as a remote worker,
it makes a big difference.

311
00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:29.570
While previously in building five,
my office was really at

312
00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:32.660
the end of the culdesac.
Yup. And no one ever

313
00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:34.700
stopped by and it was
very sad and lonely and

314
00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:36.080
they would turn the lights
off and forget I was

315
00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:41.080
in there. That's fine. That's
actually really cool. And you

316
00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:44.500
know, being able to see
other bodies moving by, you

317
00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:46.390
know, helps you stay a
little bit more connected with

318
00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:48.910
the people in the building
and feel less isolated. I

319
00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:50.770
would think, you know, just
having that movement off the

320
00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:52.960
side of the camera Isolation
was one of the things

321
00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:55.570
that I wanted to talk
to you about because I

322
00:16:55.570 --> 00:17:00.190
just get sad. I just
get lonely out here and,

323
00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:01.960
and you know, I just,
I'm not going to move.

324
00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:04.150
I will, you know, I'll
quit before I moved. Just

325
00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:07.000
because I've got, I've got
family, I've got family here,

326
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.090
extended family here, multiple family,
nieces, nephews, yada, yada, yada,

327
00:17:10.090 --> 00:17:13.960
everything is here. And we,
this just a number of

328
00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:16.930
different reasons that I can't
move well, that's actually Stop

329
00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:18.610
you there. Cause that's a,
that's a really good point.

330
00:17:18.610 --> 00:17:21.160
Cause some folks might be
listening to this and think,

331
00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:23.410
wow, you dropped 400 bucks.
So you could put a

332
00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:25.690
TV in an office somewhere
and how much on a

333
00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:28.750
camera and all this stuff.
But there are definite like

334
00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:30.970
quality of life issues that,
you know, we're trying to

335
00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:34.990
solve here. We have like
I'm on the East coast.

336
00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:37.540
So I, my wife is
not particularly interested in moving

337
00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:40.030
out to Seattle. So I'm
going to be here pretty

338
00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:43.090
much indefinitely. But even if
I had a local office

339
00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:45.070
to go to, if you
just add up like the

340
00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:48.640
time lost, you know, commuting
and then the gas cost

341
00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:50.790
or wear and all those
kind of like weird little

342
00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:54.600
one off things, then something
like a $400 TV gets

343
00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:57.140
paid for in a week
or two. Right. Even though

344
00:17:57.140 --> 00:18:02.750
I only live 250 miles,
only 250 miles from Seattle,

345
00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:05.840
it takes about four hours
up and about five hours

346
00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:08.360
down. So there's, you know,
nine hours of driving and

347
00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:10.910
you can figure that out.
You know, how much time

348
00:18:10.910 --> 00:18:12.740
that takes me. And I
try to have meetings and

349
00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:15.560
things on Bluetooth, but you
know, realistically that's a lot

350
00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:18.980
of time and it takes
about $250 with a gas

351
00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:22.550
and about $800 worth of,
of hotel, even at a

352
00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:24.980
cheap hotel if I go
up for a week. Right.

353
00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:27.380
So we know, honestly, you're
looking at just a day

354
00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:30.740
or two's time to, to
pay for that big monitor.

355
00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:33.380
And the camera was a
hundred bucks. You know, I

356
00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:36.290
don't think I've spent more
than a thousand dollars, which

357
00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:39.320
is the equivalent of less
than one trip up to

358
00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:42.740
Seattle. And if this, if
this allows me to save

359
00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:45.230
even one or two trips
a year, all the better,

360
00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:49.010
but if I get this
thing, right, not only will

361
00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:51.680
it make my life easier
and potentially save me four

362
00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:54.890
or five trips a year,
it'll make everyone else's life

363
00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:57.320
EG. Who's remote as well,
including all the people that

364
00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:01.220
we've got up in Vancouver,
Canada, and other, other remote

365
00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:05.030
people. Yeah. I think that's
really cool. And that's, and

366
00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:07.610
it's a point I wanted
to make just because somebody

367
00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:10.100
might be a said, since
there's no video here, somebody

368
00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:12.080
might be rolling their eyes
thinking about the money that

369
00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:14.750
we spend on something like
this totally worth it. I'm

370
00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:18.440
sure they are Now to,
to, to isolation this, this

371
00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:21.260
obsession that I have. And
I think we share of

372
00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:25.430
being connected to the, to
the home office is also

373
00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:28.100
a way of not being
too isolated. I mean, I

374
00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:31.310
live in a small town
and sometimes I just go

375
00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:33.920
down to the local sandwich
shop and sit just so

376
00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:38.270
I can see other, other
humans. Right. How much trouble

377
00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:39.860
do you have with that?
The idea of like, I

378
00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:43.430
know you're not a big
pair programming type, but sometimes

379
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:47.000
I'll call people just to,
just to talk to somebody.

380
00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:49.760
Yeah. I remember one day
we were going to pair

381
00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:51.950
program, but we ended up
basically with just having a

382
00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:55.970
two way webcam, ideally running
for like four hours while

383
00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:58.040
we each worked on different
stuff. And it was, you

384
00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:02.750
know, there is something about
having somebody around you professionally,

385
00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:05.960
that that helps deal with
some of the isolation. You

386
00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:08.810
know, like my, my wife
always jokes that when I'm

387
00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:12.800
working, she knows the only
connection that she gets is

388
00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:14.060
with a four year old
and a two year old.

389
00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:16.310
And eventually she just needs
to talk to other adults

390
00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:19.430
sometimes. So it's like a,
it's like a similar thing

391
00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:21.830
here. So, you know, I'll
go out sometimes, but truthfully

392
00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:24.110
I'm a, I'm a bit
of a hermit anyway. So

393
00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:28.370
I get a lot of
my, my connectivity out of

394
00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:31.490
things like Twitter and, and
I'm doing all these various

395
00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:34.730
webcam chats with different people
in the organization. Cause we

396
00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:37.490
ended up doing a lot
of meeting in our role.

397
00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:39.560
I mean, you know that
you have those days where

398
00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:41.990
basically you're on the phone
from, you know, nine o'clock

399
00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:45.350
in the morning till six
30 at night. So if

400
00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:48.340
most of those have a
with them and just say

401
00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:51.160
probably about a 60% have
webcams with them, then that

402
00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:53.770
really helps a lot. But
yeah, sometimes I need to

403
00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:55.420
just go out to the
coffee shop and hang out

404
00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:57.550
for a little bit and
see other people. Yeah. I

405
00:20:57.550 --> 00:21:01.290
think that My wife thinks
that when I, when I

406
00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:03.210
say I'm having lunch with
a friend or something that

407
00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:05.550
she's like, God, this guy
has lunch a lot. Why

408
00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:08.370
are you having lunch all
the time? But when you

409
00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:11.610
go up to campus, like
there's so much, there's so

410
00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:14.130
much time spent with people
having lunch and they take

411
00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:17.670
it for granted. Yep. Someone
will wander by your office

412
00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:20.640
and go, Hey, we're going
to lunch and decisions get

413
00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:24.000
made and meeting, you know,
and things happen. And you

414
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.940
know, human connections occur at
something as simple as lunch.

415
00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:30.120
So I've collected kind of
a bunch of lunch people

416
00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:33.510
around Portland here that I'll
hang out with probably twice

417
00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:35.670
a week, sometimes three times
a week, as well as

418
00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:39.360
Microsoft people like Chris cells
who is also a remote

419
00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:45.570
guy, just, just to keep
from going nuts. Right. Right.

420
00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:48.300
Now the thing is, so
I've only been doing this

421
00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:51.120
for a year at Microsoft,
but I did it for

422
00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:53.760
a few years at my
previous job and we didn't

423
00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:57.240
have webcams and all the
other stuff there. So I

424
00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:59.400
kind of had like the
really hard end of it,

425
00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:01.740
where you had a phone
and I am, and that

426
00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:04.170
was it. And so this
is, this is kind of

427
00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:06.390
like a lot more connectivity
now at this point. Yeah.

428
00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:09.090
And this is all a
giant company, right? This is

429
00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:10.860
a big enterprise. That's not
used to it. If you

430
00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:14.460
look at a smaller company
like stack overflow, where everyone

431
00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:18.150
is effectively remote and they
have a persistent IRC channel

432
00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:20.670
and they've got a chat
product in, they're always connected

433
00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:24.330
and it is baked into
their culture, not just their

434
00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:27.060
corporate culture, but it's also
younger people, right? I mean,

435
00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:30.300
there's Microsoft people. Who've lived
in what I call the

436
00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:36.120
Redmond reality distortion field for,
you know, 20 years. Yep.

437
00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:39.170
It's interesting. It's it's snowing
right now. Right? So it's

438
00:22:39.210 --> 00:22:43.410
like the great snow storm
of 2010. What an inch

439
00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:45.350
of snow. Yeah. I think
it's a dusting of snow.

440
00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:48.480
It looks like powdered sugar,
but apparently it's crippled the

441
00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:52.110
Northwest. I think it's the
ice, everyone. Whenever I say

442
00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:55.290
that, they're like, Ooh, that's
scary ice. It's not the

443
00:22:55.290 --> 00:22:58.290
heat. It's the humidity. Right.
Exactly. So what's happened is

444
00:22:58.410 --> 00:23:00.960
my trip to Seattle was
canceled and I'm looking at

445
00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:05.520
my, my, my chat application
here and everyone is working

446
00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:07.950
from home. Like everyone's working
from home. And I think

447
00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:12.180
this is partially psychological, partially
the holidays. And partially that

448
00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:14.670
the, you know, everything's covered
in snow, but this is

449
00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:18.720
fun each each year, because
this is the Scott gets

450
00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:21.840
to go neener neener. As
I watched, people's struggle with

451
00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:25.170
remote working remotely. Cause this
is the only time all

452
00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:28.350
the Redmond people who have
been up there forever have

453
00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:32.190
to have to work remotely.
And it shows that, and

454
00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:33.660
a lot of people are
just like, Oh yeah, bad

455
00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:35.790
weather. I'm going to work
from home. And I think

456
00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:38.880
it shows that if given
the choice, most people would

457
00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:41.190
spend at least a couple
of days a week working

458
00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:46.010
from home. I mean, it's
just that much more efficient

459
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:47.570
for the way that you
work, as well as being

460
00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:50.420
able to make it easier
to schedule around like doctor's

461
00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:52.960
appointments and things like that.
Well, there is that, and

462
00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:56.170
that, that, that is the
one kind of selfish benefit

463
00:23:56.170 --> 00:23:58.960
that we get, which is
being able to, you know,

464
00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:01.720
take an afternoon off and
go do something and not

465
00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:04.030
be seen. And we, we
both keep core kind of

466
00:24:04.030 --> 00:24:07.060
core hours, you know, I'm
available, you know, pretty much

467
00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:11.920
8:00 AM to 3:00 PM, but blowing
off work, easy blowing to

468
00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:14.990
me, blowing off work early
is a really a, a

469
00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:19.330
really easy thing when you're
working remotely. Yeah, Yeah. Yeah.

470
00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:22.480
And it's something, it does
take some, some discipline. Right.

471
00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:24.220
And I think if you've
done it for a bit,

472
00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:27.580
then, then you're kind of
used to that. And so

473
00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:29.800
there's not quite so much
temptation, but at the same

474
00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:31.660
time, it's really nice to
be able to just take

475
00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:33.970
your kids out for that
one afternoon. And I mean,

476
00:24:33.970 --> 00:24:36.520
you and I have both
been online working at two

477
00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:39.640
o'clock in the morning. Right.
So you know, that we'll

478
00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:41.800
have those core hours, but
we're definitely putting in the

479
00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:43.660
additional hours after that. Well,
you know, I think that's

480
00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:47.800
actually a bad thing. I
think as a remote worker,

481
00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:51.280
we are constantly paranoid that
we're not being perceived as

482
00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:55.180
doing enough work and in
my experience having run a

483
00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:57.310
team and then now you
have a team of remote

484
00:24:57.310 --> 00:24:59.950
people. Don't you think that
there's a little bit of,

485
00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:05.830
what's the word? Just kind
of remote guilt. And then

486
00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:10.360
we overcompensate by working extra
hard, I find that remote

487
00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:12.280
people tend to be on
at ridiculous hours. I mean,

488
00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:17.800
between you, me, John 2:00 AM
3:00 AM is not uncommon. And

489
00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:20.740
I think that it is
a way of overcompensating. Yeah.

490
00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:23.530
I mean, it really depends
on the personalities, right. So

491
00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:25.630
you mentioned John and stuff,
but I know there are

492
00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:28.390
a couple of other people
that are remote that they're

493
00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:31.780
on basically seven o'clock in
the morning until five, and

494
00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:33.550
then you will not see
them again until the next

495
00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:37.050
morning. Oh, wow. I have
not seen those people. That,

496
00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:38.980
that would, that would be
wonderful if, if I had

497
00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:43.720
that level of self control.
Yeah. So I just, I

498
00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:46.750
don't have that discipline. Plus
for me, the real advantage

499
00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:49.810
of being able to work
from home is I don't

500
00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:53.530
have to keep those specific
hours. Like, you know, if

501
00:25:53.530 --> 00:25:55.780
I want to take my
kids somewhere in the middle

502
00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:57.520
of the day when everybody
else is stuck in a

503
00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:00.970
cubicle is the best time
because nobody else is there.

504
00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:02.740
You know, you don't have
the crowds, you don't have

505
00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:04.960
the traffic or anything like
that. So I'm gonna, you

506
00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:06.100
know, take a chunk out
of the middle of the

507
00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:09.250
day and then make it
up later. Right. But the,

508
00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:11.290
you know, the people that
are on at two o'clock

509
00:26:11.290 --> 00:26:12.940
in the morning and stuff,
I think it has to

510
00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:16.210
do a lot with just
what their, what their drive

511
00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:18.190
is and what their personalities
are like. And then there

512
00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:19.660
are other people with a
lot of discipline. Like I

513
00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:22.210
said, they just do the
seven to five or whatever

514
00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:25.960
I struggle with. Well, I
mean, I don't know, this

515
00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:27.820
is getting into a whole
other level of kind of

516
00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:30.490
depth and self-loathing as the
remote work will be about

517
00:26:30.490 --> 00:26:36.820
your problems. Go, gosh, I
just worry that one day,

518
00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:38.470
someone's going to say, you're
not doing enough. You know

519
00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:39.910
what I mean? And that
as a, as a remote

520
00:26:39.910 --> 00:26:43.140
guy, it's one, it's, there's
one level of, of they're

521
00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:47.520
putting up with us we're
remote. Right? Yep. And yeah,

522
00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:49.230
I mean, yeah. I've had
people say, Oh yeah, you're

523
00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:53.640
Scott Hanselman, blah, blah, blah.
That's all, you can't have

524
00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:55.710
an ego about this kind
of stuff. Right. Everyone is

525
00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:59.940
very, very lucky to have
a job, everybody, you know?

526
00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:03.360
So your goal is to
provide value, do a good

527
00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:08.520
job. And presumably they'll, they'll
keep your, your badge working,

528
00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:10.110
right. You'll be able to
log in tomorrow and it

529
00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:13.470
still works just like Brad.
Exactly. Brad Wilson says, and

530
00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:15.300
as a remote person, I
always feel that I need

531
00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:19.140
to put in just that
much more value to justify

532
00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:23.760
the remote tax. It's not
really a financial tax. It's

533
00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:26.070
a, what I believe is
a mental tax that I,

534
00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:28.770
that I think my bosses
think this guy's remote though.

535
00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:32.600
Yeah. I mean, we've heard
comments from some people in

536
00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:35.150
the organizations that, you know,
they know we've got a

537
00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:37.730
pretty sweet gig. And so
you feel like you need

538
00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:40.160
to do just a little
bit more to assuage that

539
00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:43.160
guilt and to make them
realize that, Hey, because we're

540
00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:45.230
remote and because we're who
we are, we're able to

541
00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:47.750
give you just that much
more. Right. And then there's

542
00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:50.090
the whole, well, I'm not
blowing, you know, two to

543
00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:52.850
four hours in a car
every day, like just sitting

544
00:27:52.850 --> 00:27:54.740
around doing nothing. So I
actually do have a little

545
00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:58.010
bit more time to do
stuff. And I'll tell you

546
00:27:58.010 --> 00:28:00.890
the difference between here and
where I worked before is

547
00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:04.880
here. We're very much judged
on, you know, what we're

548
00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:07.160
producing and, and our commitments.
So that makes it a

549
00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:10.910
little bit easier than other
places where let's say that

550
00:28:10.910 --> 00:28:14.180
you're working like by the
hour and a consulting company.

551
00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:17.000
And it's really hard to
tell, you know, did you

552
00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:19.850
just have regular productivity for
eight hours or did you

553
00:28:19.910 --> 00:28:22.400
only work two hours and
just really bust your butt

554
00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:25.040
for that two hours, you
know? Yeah. Yeah. And people

555
00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:27.470
worry about that and those
types of jobs. Whereas like

556
00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:29.570
I said, since we're much
more about the results, I

557
00:28:29.570 --> 00:28:31.850
think it's, it makes it
easier to get past that.

558
00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:35.300
Absolutely. Absolutely. Do you still
like working remotely? Are you

559
00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:38.000
going to stick with it?
Yeah, I do. I mean,

560
00:28:39.290 --> 00:28:42.020
w w So as long
as Sean DIA, nobody else

561
00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:44.210
is listening. Right. So one
of the things that I

562
00:28:44.210 --> 00:28:47.090
would really be disappointed with,
if I, if I ended

563
00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:49.040
up moving up into Seattle
is having to go and

564
00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:51.830
sit in an office all
day. It's just sorta the

565
00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:53.810
way my attention span is
and stuff I do so

566
00:28:53.810 --> 00:28:57.020
much better with the freedom
of being able to get

567
00:28:57.020 --> 00:28:59.930
out and work weird hours
and work based on my

568
00:28:59.930 --> 00:29:04.310
inspiration. So, you know, if
I'm inspired at 10 30

569
00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:05.780
at night after my kids
go to sleep to go

570
00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:08.330
and do something, I can
do it. And it's not

571
00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:09.830
like I had to go
into an office to do

572
00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:15.680
that. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Well,
I'm going to keep doing

573
00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:17.960
it. Well, I provide value
and while I, you know,

574
00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:21.440
help out the community, but
I have no doubt that

575
00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:23.990
when, whenever it's time to
leave, it's probably going to

576
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:26.840
have something to do with
being a remote worker. Yeah.

577
00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:29.990
I mean, I, I feel
like we probably have a

578
00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:32.480
definite cap as far as
how far you can go

579
00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:35.060
and still not be a
warm body in an office.

580
00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:37.880
Yeah. And I just, I
don't know what that cap

581
00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:39.530
is yet, but I'm sure
we'll find out at some

582
00:29:39.530 --> 00:29:42.310
point, I'm hoping that if
I can wait it out

583
00:29:42.670 --> 00:29:46.000
Until more and more and
more remote people come in

584
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.830
and hopefully because of some
of the work that we're

585
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:51.430
doing, we're going to make
it easier for remote workers.

586
00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:53.410
So the more remote people
that come in and prove

587
00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:56.560
that it's possible. And, and,
and whether it's a, whether

588
00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:59.170
it's a portal or a
robot or a webcam on

589
00:29:59.170 --> 00:30:02.530
a Roomba, the things that
we are doing to make

590
00:30:02.530 --> 00:30:06.100
remote workers more, a part
of the culture, at least

591
00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:09.340
at this giant company, the
better chance it is that

592
00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:11.970
we'll be able to work
here longer. Yeah. And to

593
00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:13.800
be clear, those need to
be the right kind of

594
00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:16.530
people. Right. So we've, we've
all had experience with the

595
00:30:16.530 --> 00:30:19.980
remote workers that just, they
think they have the free

596
00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:23.040
day. Right. So if you
have the right kind of

597
00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:25.500
people that gives you the
everybody else to right. Impression

598
00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:27.720
of these types of folks
and yeah. It, it makes

599
00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:29.850
it better for anybody else
who comes in afterwards. Yeah,

600
00:30:29.910 --> 00:30:32.970
Absolutely. Well, thanks for chatting
with me, remote worker. I

601
00:30:32.970 --> 00:30:36.360
appreciate it. Thank you. Remote
Scott. This has been another

602
00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:39.030
episode of Hansel minutes. We'll
see you again next week.
