00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.840
talks about using Google earth,
virtual earth and SketchUp to

10
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:14.360
visualize a new home. Hi,
this is Scott Hanselman, and

11
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.360
this is another episode of
Hansel minutes. This was going

12
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.820
to include Carl Franklin, but it
turns out that the day

13
00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.510
I was taping this, there
were some lanes closed down

14
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.580
on the highway, near Carl's
house, and it looks like

15
00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.520
there was a pretty bad
accident and he's unable to

16
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.890
get to the studio. So
it's going to be me

17
00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.110
by myself. Hopefully I won't
bore you too much without

18
00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.470
my partner in crime. And
what I'm gonna be talking

19
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.750
about today is some of
the work that you're doing

20
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.600
on a house that we
built and how we used

21
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.620
Google earth and virtual earth
and SketchUp to, to model

22
00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.370
that house. Basically we've built,
we built a house, we

23
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.980
work with a builder. We
work with an architect and

24
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.190
we started with a basic
plan and then kind of

25
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.030
modified that plan and worked
within that plan. You know,

26
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.280
whether it be moving walls
or turning the house a

27
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.790
certain way, facing a certain
direction, changing porches, changing rooms,

28
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.140
adding walls, things like that.
And this was in a,

29
00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.000
in a lot, in an
area of, of Oregon where

30
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.850
we live, where there really
wasn't any what really wasn't

31
00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.010
anything. I mean, it was
a big, giant empty field

32
00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.260
out in the middle of
nowhere next to a big

33
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.050
Hill. So for me, it
was a little difficult to

34
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.210
visualize a lot of this
stuff. So there were a

35
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.760
couple of steps to this
process. And what I want

36
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.650
to talk about is how
we use technology to help

37
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.750
us understand these things. So
the, the neighborhood, we first,

38
00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.300
I found that plot, this
area that we were going

39
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.990
to be be in, in
Google earth, I used the

40
00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.290
Google earth download application, the
downloaded application, that's the full

41
00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.270
kind of direct X three
D version that a lot

42
00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.610
of you have seen. You
can also do this in

43
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.190
virtual virtual earth. And I'll
talk about it a little

44
00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.770
bit, that some of the
difference between the two in

45
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.750
this particular instance, the imagery
that I was using was

46
00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.180
quite a few years old.
So not only was I

47
00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.220
seeing the big empty lot,
but a lot of the

48
00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.360
houses that were built around
the area where we're not

49
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.790
there because we were looking
at a satellite image that

50
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.860
was at least 18 months
old, if not a little,

51
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.010
a little older. So I
found this on Google earth

52
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.260
and I put down a
push pin to basically keep

53
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.740
track of where I was
going to help me visualize

54
00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.680
my lot. And I went
and talked to the builder

55
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.190
and they gave us a
PDF file. That was basically

56
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.640
a plan of the neighborhood.
This is what the neighborhood

57
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.490
is going to look like
in three, four years when

58
00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:29.650
they've sold all the lots.
And it gave us an

59
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.290
idea of where the roads
were going to go, whether

60
00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:33.850
where the lot was going
to be about the size

61
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.910
of the lot and the
general facing of the, of

62
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.170
the house and what the
options were about, where we're

63
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.510
gonna be able to put
that house. So I brought

64
00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.590
this PDF down and depending
on whether you're using Adobe

65
00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.410
Acrobat or Fox, and you
can copy that PDF as

66
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:48.880
a bitmap, or you can
do an idea, which is

67
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.640
just take a screenshot. So
I took a screenshot of

68
00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.730
this flyer and it included
the logo and information that

69
00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.560
I didn't want. Cause it
was literally was a printed

70
00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.430
out flyer that had a,
a layout of that. Ideally

71
00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.350
I would have got the
source vectors, but this was

72
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.010
a, this whole operation is
very quick and dirty. Then

73
00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.200
I brought that into my
favorite paint program, which is

74
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.040
definitely paint.net. And if you
haven't used paint.net, you need

75
00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:17.440
to, it's a www.getpaint.net. And
it's a great application of

76
00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.910
a windows forms, app app
written entirely in.net. Microsoft eventually

77
00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.480
hired the guy. It's amazing
application. You know, the only

78
00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.490
thing that it doesn't do
that I could have used

79
00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.950
is this concept of a
free transform. And I'll talk

80
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.540
about that in a second.
That's the one thing I

81
00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.450
needed would need Photoshop for,
but I found a couple

82
00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:36.760
of ways to get around
that. So I did the

83
00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.910
screenshot of the layout of
the neighborhood and I pasted

84
00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.950
it into paint.net and I
pasted it on a layer

85
00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.280
of its own, keeping a
transparency below it. So the

86
00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.060
background was transparent, but I
pasted this big map on

87
00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.390
the screen. And then I
started deleting things. I started

88
00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:57.520
using the selection tool to
delete portions of this I

89
00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.860
didn't want. And because it
was on a separate layer

90
00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.190
and there was transparency behind
it, which is represented in

91
00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:08.230
most paint programs, including paint.net
as a checkerboard pattern. So

92
00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:10.000
when you see the checkerboard,
you know, that things are

93
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.820
transparent. I would just keep
deleting. I ended up using

94
00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.540
an eraser. I use the
magic wand selection tool. I

95
00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:20.890
used anything that I could
to basically punch out this,

96
00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.640
this neighborhood layout. So I
had a transparent layout. And

97
00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.040
then you want to save
that as a PNG cause

98
00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.540
PNGs have that extra alpha
layer. You've got RGB plus

99
00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:35.620
alpha. And the alpha is
a transparency layer that also

100
00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:41.380
gives you 255 levels of
transparency. So just like RGB,

101
00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.920
give you zero to two
55 values of red, green,

102
00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.980
and blue adding that alpha
layer, which is available in

103
00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.260
P and G and a
couple other formats, but certainly

104
00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.050
not in JPEG, that's going
to make it. So when

105
00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.600
we import our map, it's
going to look nice. So

106
00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.030
then we go into Google
into the Google earth desktop

107
00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:03.770
application, and I say, add
image overlay, which is inside

108
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.890
of the Google or Google
earth application, pulling this off

109
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:09.050
the menu. You say, add
image overlay. And then we

110
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.900
select that PNG. Now, you
know, you did it right.

111
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:15.740
If you can't see any
of the edges of the

112
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.020
white and of the logos
or anything like that came

113
00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.450
in from whatever you're trying
to import. Now, in this

114
00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:23.210
case, I'm importing a picture
of a neighborhood. This could

115
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:26.360
be another texture, or it
could be a picture that

116
00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.700
you've drawn or whatever. It
could be a logo. It

117
00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.410
doesn't necessarily have to be
a map like I've done.

118
00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:34.280
Now, when you've got this
overlaid image sitting in Google

119
00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.890
earth, oftentimes it will come
in at the wrong size.

120
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:39.590
It'll come in about the
size, you see it on

121
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:42.680
the screen. So you can
mitigate that by zooming in

122
00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.770
really far into a Google
earth and trying to get

123
00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:49.250
a one to one relationship
by orienting Google earth in

124
00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:51.920
the same way. But I
found that to be really

125
00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:56.990
difficult. Instead, you can look
in the places pain, which

126
00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:58.700
is usually on the left
side of the Googler screen.

127
00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.770
And you can find that
overlay cause it'll appear as

128
00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:03.920
a place. Anything that you
put into Google earth, whether

129
00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.750
it be a model or
an image will show up

130
00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:08.510
in your tree view, there
you can then right. Click

131
00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:10.790
on it and go properties.
And then you can see

132
00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:14.990
the transparency values. You can
see the altitude, how far

133
00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:16.850
up in the air is
this, is this thing floating

134
00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:19.790
or is it actually sitting
on the earth itself? So

135
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:23.780
then by manipulating these values,
you can kind of resize

136
00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:26.870
your, your image. It's important
to note though, that you're

137
00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:31.280
not actually resizing the image,
but rather you are kind

138
00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.650
of changing Googlers perception of
it. So this is an

139
00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:37.010
image manipulation and the classic,
this many pixels by this

140
00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:41.000
many pixels perspective, this is
about where in the latitude

141
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.120
and longitude does this thing
fit and, and how much

142
00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:47.120
space is it going to
occupy if you get it

143
00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:50.510
right, then you can close
the properties dialogue, and you

144
00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:54.440
can move Google around in
three dimensions and see how

145
00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:58.400
your, your lot diagram fits
on top of that at

146
00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.680
big empty lot and Google
earth. This is a really

147
00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.470
valuable technique. I think for
a real estate agent. Now

148
00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:06.410
I'm not a real estate
guy, but because I've been

149
00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:08.420
playing a lot with these
kinds of technologies, I have

150
00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:10.880
this kind of feeling, and
this is a little bit

151
00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.740
of an egotistical thing, but
I have this feeling that

152
00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:14.300
if I was a real
estate agent, man, I could

153
00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:16.460
really tear it up because
I would be the real

154
00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:19.010
estate agent that would come
with a big ass laptop.

155
00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:22.430
Sit down in your living
room, model, the house show

156
00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:25.760
you different neighborhoods. We do
like 3d flyovers. I don't

157
00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.890
know if that would impress
me if I was buying

158
00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:29.510
a house. I don't know
if that would necessarily impress

159
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:31.520
the other people. I'm sure
there's lots of aspects of

160
00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.110
real estate that have nothing
to do with that. But

161
00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:35.270
I sure feel like I
would be impressed if I

162
00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:37.940
could do that. I had
a real estate agent recently

163
00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:41.570
on another house that we
had as a rental and

164
00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:45.380
he did the entire transaction
on a tablet PC, and

165
00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:47.300
he wasn't that technical, but
he just really liked the

166
00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:49.880
idea of not having paper.
So we were just signing

167
00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:52.430
TIF files and using the
windows fax and scan. He'd

168
00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:54.020
done the whole, he come
up with a whole workflow

169
00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:56.910
based entirely on TIFF files
and it was just a

170
00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:58.980
very cool experience. And then
at the end, he gave

171
00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:01.860
me an encrypted CD rom
with my, my documents on

172
00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:04.530
it more and more. We're
seeing that actually, when we,

173
00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:07.380
when we finished closing on
this house, which was through

174
00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:10.500
a larger company, we received
a, a CD rom with,

175
00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:12.510
with those files encrypted on
it. I thought that was

176
00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:16.950
pretty slick. Now, in this
instance, I'm using Google earth

177
00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:20.880
to lay overlay this, this
imagery, and I'm seeing a

178
00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:23.640
pretty old satellite image. So
I went over to Microsoft

179
00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:26.550
virtual earth. You can get
to that from virtual earth.com

180
00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:31.590
or maps.live.com. They've got those
helicopter flyovers. So then I

181
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:34.020
can actually look at a
helicopter fly over of the

182
00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:37.500
area or airplane or drone,
some kind of Ninja airplane

183
00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.500
that flew over and took
pictures of the area from

184
00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:44.880
a much, much lower altitude.
And these are done kind

185
00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.430
of an a, an isometric
view. There are there a

186
00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:53.610
specific angle, so they're very
regular these images. So then

187
00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:57.570
you can use in paint.net,
the rotate zoom tool. It's

188
00:09:57.570 --> 00:09:59.910
not the free transform what
the free transform lets you

189
00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:01.770
do. And the free transform
is something that people are

190
00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:05.400
begging for paint.net to have
maybe the listen to this

191
00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:08.220
podcast and will help us
out. But basically it allows

192
00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:12.540
you to grab the handles
of something that you've selected.

193
00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:15.300
So you can draw a
square rubber band and then

194
00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:18.690
grab a handle. And then
as you move, it basically

195
00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:22.050
transform it to fit into
a three dimensional space. You

196
00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:24.240
can skew it any way
that you want. You can

197
00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:27.840
do similar stuff with the
rotate zoom, the rotate zoom

198
00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:30.990
tool basically gives you a
picture of a three dimensional

199
00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:34.890
ball that you can then
turn and, and then change

200
00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:37.200
the perspective that we are
looking at that particular image.

201
00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:43.190
It's a little unrefined, but
it allowed me to, to

202
00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:46.890
do this, this virtual earth
where I basically turned at

203
00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:51.000
30 degrees and viewed my
layout, my lot layout in

204
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.350
a much better, a much
better piece of imagery. So

205
00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:59.460
the point that I'm trying
to make is that I

206
00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:02.130
guess I'm disappointed that it's
so difficult for someone like

207
00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:04.770
my mom or my, you
know, on nontechnical kind of

208
00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:09.840
archetypal person to take something
like a PDF extract, an

209
00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:12.570
image out of it and
get that into an application

210
00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:14.400
like Google earth. I mean,
Google earth goes out of

211
00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:17.790
its way to make this
available to you. But even

212
00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:20.100
the, even the basic concept
of like layers and something

213
00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:22.650
like paintbrush doesn't exist. So
you have to go and

214
00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:25.440
put paint.net on the machine.
So the barrier to entry

215
00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:28.500
just for basic image manipulation
is, is too much because

216
00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:31.050
even layers aren't available to
the average Joe, unless they

217
00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:33.990
go looking for an image
manipulation program, but then also

218
00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:38.370
the idea of taking a
screenshot, cropping it punching out

219
00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:42.390
transparency. The barrier to entry
is really great. It seems

220
00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:45.150
very intuitive to the alpha
geek to the person who

221
00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:46.950
gets this, but I'm still,
haven't quite figured out how

222
00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:49.770
I'm going to explain this
to someone other than teaching

223
00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:52.140
them by rote and saying,
well, just, just do this

224
00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:54.760
step by step. Here's how
it works. When I think

225
00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:57.250
that it's the why that
makes it so interesting. Why

226
00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:00.760
does this work? Why is
this possible? So then the

227
00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:03.670
next step, which happened a
little bit later when we

228
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:07.780
actually picked our lot picked
our lot picked our layout,

229
00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:09.850
and then we needed to
do some kind of architectural

230
00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:12.280
changes and we had the
architect draw up what we

231
00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.530
wanted the house to look
like. And then I taught

232
00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:17.470
the real estate agent how
to use this Google SketchUp

233
00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:21.130
program. It's a fantastic application.
It's completely turned three D

234
00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:24.130
modeling on its head. I
did some three D modeling

235
00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:27.940
about 10 years ago and
it was tedious at best.

236
00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:29.860
It was very, very difficult.
I found it to be

237
00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:32.560
very frustrating. I ended up,
I did some AutoCAD as

238
00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:35.140
well, and I found AutoCAD
and doing machining to be

239
00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:36.670
a lot more intuitive than
some of the three D

240
00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:40.060
modeling applications are out there.
The SketchUp has a different

241
00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:43.450
perspective on doing things because
it has this inference engine.

242
00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:47.020
It has this notion of
inferring what the user might

243
00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:51.040
want to do, because it's
going to use the view

244
00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:53.830
that you have of a
three dimensional object, whether it

245
00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:55.720
be a top view or
side view or coming in

246
00:12:55.720 --> 00:13:01.180
from an isometric perspective. And
it infers what you are

247
00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:04.240
trying to do, whether you,
whether you've put your pencil

248
00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:06.760
on an intersection of a
line, whether you've put your

249
00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:09.340
pencil on the face of
a particular object or on

250
00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:14.560
its edge. And it's basically
guessing correctly, it's inferring that

251
00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:17.140
well, he clearly, he or
she clearly means to do

252
00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:20.800
this because they have put
the mouse here. And the

253
00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.920
view is in that way.
So basically using the eye,

254
00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:29.350
the, the way that we
think about three dimensions, you

255
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:34.180
know, to our benefits. So
I worked with my, my

256
00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:36.520
real estate agent who is
kind of a, not, not

257
00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:40.060
a geek, but he definitely
has the geek potential and

258
00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:42.640
showed him how to use
SketchUp and explain how we

259
00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:46.600
can take our architectural documents,
our architectural diagram, which has

260
00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:51.730
done a classic style and
then scan it, take that

261
00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:54.280
architectural diagram. And just as
we talked earlier, where I

262
00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:58.600
put a, a lot diagram
and took that piece of

263
00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:01.180
texture and then overlayed it
in Google earth, we can

264
00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:04.780
then take that plan, that
architectural plan, and then lay

265
00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:06.790
it out on a layer
inside of SketchUp. So we're

266
00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:09.940
basically going to trace the
bottom floor of the house.

267
00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:14.140
SketchUp lets you draw lines.
And then in the lower

268
00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:17.470
right corner in the status
bar, it shows you the

269
00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:19.860
number of inches and feet
that that line is. And

270
00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:22.750
of course you can change
that to different measurement units.

271
00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:25.480
And then you can type
in the number from the

272
00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:28.510
architectural diagram so that you
can say, I want this

273
00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:30.820
to be this wall to
be exactly 25 feet, three

274
00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:33.610
inches, because that's what the
diagram is. And then as

275
00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:36.580
you connect those lines, it
will then infer that, Oh,

276
00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:39.820
he's, he's drawn a complete
closed shape that is now

277
00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:45.440
a two dimensional plane. Once
it's created that plane, that

278
00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:47.980
that object has some solidity,
suddenly a bunch of lines

279
00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:50.470
becomes a face. And then
that's where the power of

280
00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:53.600
SketchUp gets. It gets going
because then you can take

281
00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:56.540
that face and then grab
it and pull on it

282
00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:01.430
and extrude a two dimensional
object into three dimensional space.

283
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:04.730
So it's literally a progression
from one dimensional, two dimensional,

284
00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:06.680
three dimensional. If you take
a point and turn it

285
00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:09.740
into a line, align into
a two dimensional phase and

286
00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:13.160
then extrude into something more.
So then if I had

287
00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:17.360
like a draw square pole
on the face, I get

288
00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:20.210
a cube. Maybe I would
draw a small rectangle to

289
00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:22.790
indicate a door, select it
and then hit delete. And

290
00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:25.430
suddenly I've got a hole
in my model. It's that?

291
00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:30.140
It's that easy. So we
drew the house, we actually

292
00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:33.110
did the first floor, second
floor and the roof separately

293
00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:36.740
and then stack them on
to each other. That that

294
00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:38.690
felt easier to us. I
know that there's lots of

295
00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:40.820
people who know a lot
more about SketchUp and a

296
00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:43.550
lot smarter about SketchUp than
we are, but that really

297
00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:46.910
seemed intuitive to us because
it let us each deal

298
00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:50.720
with the, the Flores separately,
do the texturing and whatnot,

299
00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:55.100
which we'll talk about in
a second within that. Now

300
00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:57.680
there are some advanced features
in SketchUp that we had

301
00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:00.260
a little trouble with, but
you can do animations. You

302
00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:03.410
can do Y you know,
fly overs and walkthroughs and

303
00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:06.470
spent, you know, look at
the front, elevation the side

304
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:10.820
elevation. I know that there's
a SketchUp pro program that,

305
00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:13.820
that real structural engineers that
know what they're doing can

306
00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:16.430
use it as a lot
more features. But SketchUp free

307
00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:18.980
is just a community supported
thing that you can download.

308
00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:22.580
You can use for, you
know, not just modeling something

309
00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:24.650
like a house, but you
could model any do it

310
00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:27.950
yourself project that you're working
on, or even an addition

311
00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:30.500
to your house laying out
your backyard. You know, it's

312
00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:34.940
really flexible. Now building the
wire frame was fairly straight

313
00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:37.940
forward and we had this
kind of big white empty

314
00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:42.230
house, but then SketchUp has
this notion of materials and

315
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:44.150
they've got a whole materials
library. You can also go

316
00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:47.420
online and download additional bonus
materials. And those materials are

317
00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:51.950
things like Cedar shakes, textures,
concrete, roofing, all the kinds

318
00:16:51.950 --> 00:16:56.030
of textures that you see
in life. And we also

319
00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:59.960
took a few pictures of,
of specific things like Cedar

320
00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:03.410
shakes and certain textures of
wood and made sure that

321
00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:06.530
they were repeating. And then
you just select the texture

322
00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:10.670
and paint it with a,
a standard fill tool. And

323
00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:12.710
then once we started to
paint this house, it really

324
00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:15.680
became something, something real. It
went from just being a

325
00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:19.040
wireframe to being very solid
and then sketch up, includes

326
00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:21.260
a little, a little man
who sits in the corner

327
00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:24.470
there. And it's basically he's
the six foot tall reference

328
00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:28.580
point. So once we modeled
that, we went back over

329
00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:31.100
to Google earth. Remember earlier
in Google earth, we put

330
00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:35.780
the, the layout of the
lot. We overlayed that inside

331
00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:37.880
of Google earth on the
actual location of the lot.

332
00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:41.660
And then there is the
feature in SketchUp where there's

333
00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:45.440
a, a relationship between the
two programs, basically Google earth

334
00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:48.140
and SketchUp talk to each
other. So you find the

335
00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:49.860
spot in Google earth where
you're going to do this

336
00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:52.890
work. You're going to put
your model in there. And

337
00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:54.780
this is kind of on
a counterintuitive to me because

338
00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:56.700
what I thought I was
supposed to do, it was

339
00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:59.580
going to sketch up and
then say file export and

340
00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:02.130
go into Google earth and
say file import. And while

341
00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:04.530
that worked, I had a
heck of a time positioning

342
00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:06.630
my house. I think I
ended up throwing it down

343
00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:08.730
somewhere in the middle of
Kansas, which is not where

344
00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:14.070
I live. Instead. SketchUp has
these toolbar buttons for get

345
00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:17.070
current image from Google earth
and place image, which is

346
00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:19.080
really very clever. You go
on Google earth, you find

347
00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:22.500
the spot where your house
should be. Then you say,

348
00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:26.640
get images from Google earth,
basically get the current location,

349
00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:29.670
get the current view. Then
they talk to each other

350
00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:33.720
cross process. And then inside
of your SketchUp model, temporarily

351
00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:38.880
comes a black and white
texture that represents Google Earth's

352
00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:42.540
position. It appears on the
floor of your diagram. Then

353
00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:45.330
within SketchUp, you place your
house using the tools and

354
00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:49.740
SketchUp that you're familiar with.
Then you say place, object,

355
00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:52.860
view your model and Google
earth. And then it automatically

356
00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:56.520
kind of automates Google earth,
X and SketchUp expert in

357
00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:59.850
the documents as an appropriate
model, importing into Google earth

358
00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:03.510
and placing it, placing it
with terms of orientation, as

359
00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:06.330
well as altitude. A couple
of times, my house ended

360
00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:08.850
up being a few feet
underground because one of the

361
00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:10.440
things that we didn't build
in our house was an

362
00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:14.280
actual basement. We didn't put
in any kind of a

363
00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:17.130
foundation. The house itself doesn't
have a basement, but every

364
00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:19.800
house has a foundation. So
if I were to do

365
00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:23.250
this again differently, I would
probably add about a three

366
00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:26.280
to four foot big old
chunk of concrete block that

367
00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:28.260
this thing would sit on
because right now my house

368
00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:32.880
in the virtual world is
about six inches underground. So

369
00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:36.000
then in Google earth, we
positioned that, turned it a

370
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.100
certain way. And then I
went to the house, went

371
00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:40.410
to the actual house, which
is now bite me last

372
00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:42.930
week was built. And I
took a picture standing in

373
00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:45.060
front of the house. I
went back over to Google

374
00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:48.780
earth, turned it around and
kind of move the camera

375
00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:51.720
in an appropriate way to
get as close as I

376
00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:56.340
could to that same position,
just to prove the model

377
00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:58.920
that we had done earlier
looked in fact like the

378
00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:02.430
real house. And it did
a couple of things, looked

379
00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:04.290
a little different as far
as the number of columns

380
00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:06.210
and stuff. And I'll, we'll
have a link up on

381
00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:07.650
the handsome and it's site
for you to see the

382
00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:11.430
differences between these two things.
But it didn't take a

383
00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:13.800
lot of effort. I mean,
a couple of days work

384
00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:16.110
early on in the process
really helped my wife and

385
00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:19.680
I visualize it helped us
pick colors for the rooms

386
00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:22.740
because we could see what
those colors, you know, kind

387
00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:25.890
of what it would kind
of look like. Interestingly enough,

388
00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:29.130
when you're sitting in one
room and you glance over

389
00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:30.780
and you look through the
door and you see the

390
00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:33.150
color on the wall in
the other room, that kind

391
00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:36.240
of has an effect. That's
a fairly subtle aesthetic that

392
00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:40.020
you wouldn't notice unless you
actually painted the house ahead

393
00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:43.590
of time with Google earth
and this the SketchUp program,

394
00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:46.800
you can actually walk through
the house like quake style.

395
00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:49.720
You can it into walk
mode. You can move around

396
00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:53.140
from place to place and
then turn around and see

397
00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:56.130
through the door into the
other room. And maybe you

398
00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:57.670
see the colors that you
put there. So you can

399
00:20:57.670 --> 00:20:59.410
see if a color in
one room clashes with a

400
00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:02.410
color and another. So a
little bit of effort invested

401
00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:04.360
upfront, being able to walk
through the house in a

402
00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:07.780
virtual sense, allowed us to
make decisions that we needed

403
00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:11.830
that were permanent decisions about
where rooms were laid out

404
00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:15.160
so that when the nine
month process, the much longer

405
00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:18.670
process of actually building the
house happened, we felt confident

406
00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:21.340
in those decisions. And it
didn't take much of an

407
00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:23.380
investment. I mean, I'm not
a three D modeler by

408
00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:27.310
any means. My, my real
estate agent is just, you

409
00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:29.500
know, a guy who was
having a lot of fun

410
00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:34.000
modeling in 3d, but the,
that, that interaction between Google

411
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:39.250
earth, between paint.net, between Acrobat
green SketchUp, I felt really

412
00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:41.710
worked very, very well. Once
we understood some of the

413
00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:46.090
basic concepts about transparency, about
what's transparent. What's not about

414
00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:50.320
orientation getting our heads around
3d. It was a really

415
00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:52.420
useful thing. And I really
encourage people to take a

416
00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:56.980
look at all of those
applications, Google earth, paint.net, Google

417
00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:59.470
SketchUp. I'll put links to
all of this on the

418
00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:02.260
Hanselman at site. And you
can certainly go up on

419
00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:05.950
my site and search for
sketchup@hanselman.com and check that out.

420
00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:10.000
Well, that's been my lone
Wolf edition of Hansel minutes

421
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.490
without Carl this week. Just
talking to myself into this

422
00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:15.640
big microphone for your pleasure.
I hope you enjoyed this

423
00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:17.320
again. I'm not much of
an expert when it comes

424
00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:18.880
to Google earth and SketchUp,
and I did have a

425
00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:20.800
lot of fun and I
encourage you to check it

426
00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:23.560
out and I hope you
as well. We'll see you

427
00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:36.240
next week on Hanson. <inaudible>.
