When you need to focus
on building, do you want

2
00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:04.860
to get bogged down by
your database? Mongo DB is

3
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.650
an intuitive, flexible document database
that lets you get to

4
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.340
building Mongo. DBS document model
is a natural way to

5
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.520
represent data so you can
focus on what matters. Mongo

6
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.310
DB Atlas is the best
way to use Mongo DB.

7
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.250
It's a global cloud database
service that gives you all

8
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.430
of the developer productivity of
Mongo DB. Plus the added

9
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.940
simplicity of a fully managed
database service. You can get

10
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:47.210
started free with Mongo DB
atlas@mongodb.com slash Atlas. Hi, this

11
00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.580
is Scott Hanselman. This is
another episode of Hansel minutes.

12
00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.860
And today I'm talking with
you, Bailey is the author

13
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.460
and maintainer of OBS studio
on the ops project. How

14
00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.180
are you? Great. How about
you? Ah, you know, I'm

15
00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.300
enjoying my pandemic as pandemics
go. It's a, it's a

16
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.790
good one. I would guess
I am. We are safe.

17
00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.970
Hopefully your folks are safe
as well. Yeah. I'm just,

18
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.060
you know, staying at home,
you know, I never really

19
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.360
go outside anyway. So a
lot of people are saying,

20
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.920
yeah, I guess my lifestyle
is called pandemic. Yeah. Yeah.

21
00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.960
I'm pretty much I've. I,
I just never really went

22
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.960
outside that much, so it
didn't really change much for

23
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.710
me. Well, hopefully that'll work
out well. So you are

24
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.340
the original author and maintainer
of open broadcaster software, the

25
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.260
OBS project now OBS studio.
Is it true? The rumor

26
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.570
or the legend is that
you just wanted something that

27
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.360
you could like, you know,
stream a game with? Like,

28
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.630
was it like star StarCraft,
stark? He just went like,

29
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.940
yeah, I have StarCraft two
on a stream. StarCraft two,

30
00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.180
I guess before I play
StarCraft, I will write a

31
00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.200
complete cross-platform streaming and recording
platform. Well, it wasn't cross-platform

32
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.960
at first, the first than
the first version was just

33
00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.890
windows on and it was,
it was pretty terrible, but

34
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.160
it worked pretty well despite
being written pretty terribly. I

35
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.260
didn't know what I was
doing. So I was just

36
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.370
like kind of winging it,
I suppose. Not even to

37
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.160
this day, I'm still winging
it sometimes, but, but back

38
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.640
then I was really winging
it and just wanted to

39
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.830
do everything myself. You know,
I wanted to figure out

40
00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.040
everything myself. I wanted to
do all like the color

41
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.160
conversions myself and do all
the encoding myself and just

42
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.530
figure everything out because it
was fun. And you know,

43
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.600
I always loved to write
my own tools. You know,

44
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.190
I was just that sort
of programmer who would love

45
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.880
to write and write his
own stuff. It does feel

46
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.650
like, like this is just
kind of me making I'm

47
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.480
I'm anthropomorphizing the software. It
feels like it's a series

48
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.400
of Lego pieces. Like it
feels like it was written

49
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.230
with the, Oh, this, this
can be a plugin and

50
00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.330
this can be a, an
add on, and this can

51
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.310
be a plugin. Like you
were playing with Legos where

52
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.060
the Legos were codex. Yeah,
pretty much. I mean, I

53
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.270
designed at least a, this
version to be modular to

54
00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.480
where you can just like
install any everything's basically everything's

55
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.370
a plugin based. So everything's
modular, you know, and you

56
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.750
can install additional plugins and
get plugins from our forums

57
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.970
and, you know, extend the
program and things like that.

58
00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.740
So let's up level and
explain to folks who don't

59
00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.100
know what OBS is, right?
This is a streaming and

60
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.510
recording program. It's, it's kind
of a complete television studio

61
00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.450
on your computer. Yeah, pretty
much. It's like, I suppose

62
00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.650
the most accurate way is
to say a desktop. It's

63
00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.840
not even just desktop people
use it to capture more

64
00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:44.850
than those thoughts, but it's
a capturing recording streaming program

65
00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.300
and it's the, yeah. It's
like live capturing and reporting

66
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:53.340
streaming programs and yeah, people
use it for pretty much

67
00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.410
anything when it comes to,
you know, needing to capture

68
00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.430
like even like say your
webcam or your desktop or

69
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.890
a video game. It was
primarily written for video games.

70
00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.730
Cause I wanted to stream
video games, but, but it

71
00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.980
ended up, ended up being
so much more and I

72
00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.840
had to keep adding to
it and adding to it

73
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.330
and based upon a user
feedback, you know, because people

74
00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.880
wanted more and more and
then just program just kind

75
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.940
of blew up from there.
Yeah. One of the things

76
00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.730
that I think is the
most powerful that I think

77
00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:22.590
people are really starting to
come to terms with is

78
00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.250
it's concept of scene composition.
This is the thing it's

79
00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.610
a real time source device
capture. It's a recording studio.

80
00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.700
It's a broadcasting studio, but
it's, it's so thoughtful in

81
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.460
the way that it allows
you to compose scenes. And

82
00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.410
when I explain it to
people like you need to

83
00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.270
make a scene and you
need to compose that scene.

84
00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.420
That's the first big concept
that they don't get. I'll

85
00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.430
I'll introduce it to someone
they'll go, Oh, it's Camtasia.

86
00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.820
I was like, well, no,
it's not really. Oh, well

87
00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.640
what is it? It's just
a router. Well, no, let's

88
00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.250
talk about your scene. Once
we get them past that

89
00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.370
mental block of composing a
scene, you kind of see

90
00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.890
them click in and they
go, Oh my goodness. I

91
00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:00.210
could do this. I can
do this. I can do

92
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:05.250
that. Yeah. It's yeah. I,
I didn't really know what

93
00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:06.960
I was doing at the
time. So I just designed

94
00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.980
it, you know, based upon
my best guess of like

95
00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.270
how I would make a
composition program if I were

96
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.280
to do something like this.
And so I came up

97
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.640
with the scene where it
was like, based upon scenes

98
00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.310
and sources, you'd have like
a bunch of sources and

99
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.950
you'd put them into a
scene and then you could

100
00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.170
create another scene and then
you could switch between those

101
00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:30.600
scenes. And it would like
fade between those scenes. And

102
00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.680
it was a, it's a
pretty simple concept. And one

103
00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:39.990
that I feel like most
people understand pretty clearly. Once,

104
00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.680
once, once it clicks, it's
like, Oh yeah, that's pretty

105
00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.040
simple. Yeah, Exactly. Once it
clicks, it's like, wait a

106
00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.070
second. And then I can
have collections of scenes. And

107
00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:53.760
then you're often you're off
and running. And the, even

108
00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.620
now as I've been using
it for quite a while,

109
00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.200
I am still and thinking
about new sources. And I

110
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.020
think that's one of the
other exciting things about OBS

111
00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.720
is that, you know, you,
you, you, you install it,

112
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.450
you put your webcam up
there, you put maybe a

113
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:10.670
Kyron or a little thing
at the bottom that says

114
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:13.730
your name. And then, you
know, if, if MSNBC ever

115
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:15.620
calls you you're ready to
go because you're like, yeah,

116
00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.480
I'm ready to put my
name at the bottom. That's

117
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:22.310
cool. And then recently I
discovered this thing called obs.ninja.

118
00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.880
Have you played with that?
I haven't Not played with

119
00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.250
it, but I've heard of
it. I don't actually remember

120
00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:30.280
what it's all about. Well,
so one of the things

121
00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.560
that I've been doing and
other people in my community

122
00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.380
have been doing are running,
are running our conferences, non

123
00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:38.740
OBS now, right with COVID
OBS is having a moment.

124
00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.440
And then we'll talk about
that. And what obs.ninja does

125
00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:44.140
is it basically is a
website you go to, it

126
00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:48.190
uses JavaScript and various JavaScript
API is to capture your,

127
00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:51.340
your video and your audio.
And then we just go

128
00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:55.750
into OBS and add a
browser source. And this allows

129
00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:58.210
me to have someone give
me their video, give me

130
00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:01.240
their audio, give me their
shared desktop and they'll have

131
00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:05.440
to install anything. It's just
a lovely open source add

132
00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.530
on that means no one
has to Skype in or

133
00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:11.590
teams in or zoom in.
They just use a browser

134
00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:15.760
source, which is amazing. Wow.
Yeah. That is amazing. Yeah.

135
00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.960
It's, it's just like a,
I was telling you, I

136
00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:23.440
made it modular and people
started creating all these cool

137
00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:28.390
ad-ons and things like that.
And the I'm really proud

138
00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:33.550
of like everything that the
community has made. Just so

139
00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:36.220
many amazing people. I feel
like, I feel like the

140
00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.590
thing I'm most proud of,
isn't really so much the

141
00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:41.500
software, but the community that's
built around it, it's just

142
00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:46.540
absolutely wonderful community. What is
something that someone made for

143
00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:50.530
OBS that surprised you? And
you were like, Oh, I

144
00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:54.370
did not see that coming.
Hmm. That's a good question.

145
00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:56.170
You know, what's an add
in or a plugin that

146
00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:59.620
is like technologically Epic and
you're like, Oh, that's I

147
00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:02.560
should've thought about that. That's
a genius plugin idea. Well,

148
00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:07.770
I, I'm not sure if
I've ever like thought of

149
00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:10.630
like any particular bug. And
I was like, Oh, that's

150
00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:12.400
a genius plug in idea.
I wish I had gone

151
00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:17.140
to that, but I have
seen some crazy plugins that

152
00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:21.100
have surprised me, like a
facial recognition, plugins, you know,

153
00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:24.550
like face mask plugins, where
you would have like a

154
00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:28.510
stuff pop up over your
face and things like that.

155
00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:31.660
And people have done just
so many amazing things with

156
00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:34.600
the program that it just
blows my mind and people

157
00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.490
use it for so many
things that I just never

158
00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:39.250
really expect like that. And
it's like the, like the

159
00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:41.050
example you were talking about,
that's kind of like an

160
00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:44.380
example. It sort of blows
my mind. It's just, it's

161
00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:47.350
amazing that I just go
back to what I was

162
00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:50.380
saying about the community. The
community is just an absolutely

163
00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:54.550
wonderful community and they've just
made it into something greater

164
00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:58.310
than the sum of its
whole. It's really wonderful. Is

165
00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:01.970
that because of the, that
original plan of modularity, when

166
00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:04.370
you got, when you, when
you started, when you then

167
00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:09.320
have other contributors get involved,
is there a, a manifesto

168
00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:12.020
or this, we believe as
the, as the, as the

169
00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:14.210
team, the OBS project says,
okay, we're going to do

170
00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:16.220
a new feature. Let's make
sure that this is extensible.

171
00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:19.490
No, I wouldn't. I wouldn't
necessarily say that we have

172
00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:24.470
like any sort of manifesto
or anything to answer your

173
00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:29.870
first question about like, whether
I intended for this stuff

174
00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:32.810
to happen with, like it
being modular and yeah. I

175
00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:35.720
mean, to some extent, yeah.
I don't think I had

176
00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:39.470
some of these ideas in
mind, like the examples that

177
00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:43.940
you're stating, but in general,
the, I made it open

178
00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:47.750
source to allow this sort
of stuff. And that was,

179
00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:51.470
I think the biggest blessing,
just being open source and

180
00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:54.710
having so many wonderful people
come into the program and

181
00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:58.910
contribute so many wonderful things
like that. But for your

182
00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:01.820
second question about whether we
have like a manifestor or

183
00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:06.860
anything. No, no, I, I
really don't ever have I

184
00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:08.660
kind of being honest with
you, I'm kind of winging

185
00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:12.260
it sometimes. I'm just like
each patch. I'll be like,

186
00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.300
okay, well, what do we
work on next? And it's

187
00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:18.620
just like complete blank slate
sometimes. Yeah. I just it's,

188
00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:21.620
it can be kind of
hard because I don't really,

189
00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:27.110
it's kind of hard for
me to be able to

190
00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:32.000
like have this longterm plan
sometimes because things are constantly

191
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.670
changing. Like the whole COVID
situation. It forced me to

192
00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:39.200
write like a virtual camera
plugin or, or at least

193
00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:43.130
integrate the existing virtual camera
plugin into the program. And

194
00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:45.530
so I basically had to
stop what I was thinking

195
00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:48.470
about or going to do.
And I, I just decided

196
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:50.210
to write that. So that'll
be something in the next

197
00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:55.880
version version 26, but yeah,
we don't really have any

198
00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:59.420
sort of manifesto. It's just
like, we're just kind of

199
00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:04.220
operating at the edge of
our seats here. It's kind

200
00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:07.040
of funny. Well, to, to,
to your credit though, I

201
00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:09.710
think there is an implied
manifesto in it is one

202
00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:14.510
of stability. I have been
running it for months. I

203
00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:16.730
couldn't tell you the last
time I restarted it. And

204
00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:18.200
that's one of the things
that I think is worth

205
00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:20.810
calling out to your, your
credit and the team's credit.

206
00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:25.250
I'm curious, there doesn't appear
to be any major leaks.

207
00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:28.100
You're pushing 30 frames a
second on my computer for

208
00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:31.580
the last several weeks, without
any trouble, without any hiccups.

209
00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:36.740
It is, it is to
its credit that it is

210
00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:43.070
such a stable thing. That
must not be luck. Well,

211
00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:47.900
I mean, for the stability,
I'm pretty anal about having

212
00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:52.220
good code, you know, that
there would be people who

213
00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:54.310
would argue with you on
point, because there are some

214
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:56.730
people who I'm sure that
there are things you can

215
00:11:56.730 --> 00:11:58.440
do that would hurt it.
But for the most part,

216
00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.480
it is well thought of
for its stability. And I

217
00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:05.760
have found it to be
rock solid. I do. The

218
00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:10.590
program is extremely multithreaded internally
and it's, it was very,

219
00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:14.370
it was very challenging to
get it to this point.

220
00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:17.370
There's, there's been so many
times, I can't even begin

221
00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:21.270
to tell you where we've
had like thread locks and

222
00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:24.300
things like that, and just
hard locks, you know, and

223
00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:31.350
it's, and it's just, you
have to be really, really

224
00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:36.450
careful with it. And the
I'm very, very anal and

225
00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:39.000
very selective about the code
that goes into the project.

226
00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:43.170
If anybody's making like this
big pull request, I'll just

227
00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:47.310
be like sweating bullets over
it. And you know, it

228
00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:50.400
just makes me nervous every
single time because, you know,

229
00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:53.280
it's like, you know, eventually,
you know, I'm going to

230
00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.770
miss something and something's going
to break, you know, that's

231
00:12:55.950 --> 00:13:00.600
happens quite frequently, but, and
also we don't have automated

232
00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:04.200
testing what we've just added
automated testing, just minor automated

233
00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:08.130
testing. But we, for that
entire duration that you're talking

234
00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:14.520
about, we haven't had automated
testing. So yeah, every time

235
00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:18.510
we make a release, it's
a very nerve wracking experience

236
00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:24.480
because we have to constantly
release a couple hotfixes. Inevitably,

237
00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:28.860
after that know, we did
eventually, you know, start having

238
00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:32.220
like a beta process just
to supplement it. But yeah,

239
00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:35.520
it's kind of inevitable when
you don't have it Automated

240
00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:38.850
testing, but I guess the
fear of regressions would be

241
00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:43.380
a challenging one. Yeah. Just,
you just gotta be super

242
00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:47.820
paranoid about it, I guess.
Is there internally, I assume

243
00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:49.920
that there's a, there's a
pipeline of sorts that you

244
00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:52.230
run filters and all of
the different things as a

245
00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:55.680
internal compositor, but you want
to keep the work that

246
00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:59.580
you're doing internally down to
as few milliseconds as possible.

247
00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:03.600
And my team and I,
as we also integrate this

248
00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:07.170
ourselves internally at Microsoft with,
with Microsoft teams and stuff

249
00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:09.560
like that. So like I
run all of my, my

250
00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:12.540
meetings on zoom or teams
or whatever through this, I'll

251
00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:15.420
occasionally have to move some
audio and whatnot and millisecond

252
00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:19.350
here and there. What causes
those millisecond hiccups and, and

253
00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:21.510
how do you keep those
things synchronized? Well, what do

254
00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:25.050
you mean by If I
run things, if like, if

255
00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:27.510
NDI gets involved in all,
then it's like, Oh shoot,

256
00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:29.520
I've added some latency. Or
if I had a bunch

257
00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:33.120
of filters, I'm sure that
I'm adding some millisecond or

258
00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.400
two as a, as an
audio filter or a video

259
00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:39.630
filter does some thing. And
I've always wondered, how do

260
00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:43.230
you keep my mouth bliss
linked up with the audio?

261
00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:48.360
It's really difficult. It's, it's
a, yeah, that goes down

262
00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:51.030
to the sub system. Pretty
much. It all comes down

263
00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:54.260
to the timestamp of each
audio segment in each video

264
00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:56.630
frame. So if you have
like a video frame, it

265
00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:59.360
has like a specific timestamp
associated. If you have an

266
00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:02.150
audio for him or a
set of audio friends, you

267
00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:06.620
have a timestamp associate associated
with that. And then basically

268
00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:10.640
the audio subs, they have
to sync it up to

269
00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:14.570
like they have to use
those numbers and they have

270
00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:17.930
to insert it. The audio
has to be inserted like

271
00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:23.000
at a specific, a specific
frame to be able to

272
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.520
make sure that it matches
up the video. It's like,

273
00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:27.950
it operates from the assumption
that the video is always

274
00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:30.710
correct and not the audio
needs to adjust based upon

275
00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:34.640
the audio timestamps. So the
audio timestamp, we'll see, you

276
00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:36.110
know, what the video is
currently on and it will

277
00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:41.540
basically automatically adjust the audio
segment and it will put

278
00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:44.210
it into the circular buffer,
place it into the circular

279
00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:46.790
buffer at the specific point.
It's not, it's not actually

280
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:49.550
like placing at the end
of the circular bumper places,

281
00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:54.080
like at a specific point
it's, it's, it's really complicated,

282
00:15:54.080 --> 00:16:00.640
but it's it's yeah. It's,
it's basically just timestamps. Interesting.

283
00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:03.550
So when you flow things
in and out of windows

284
00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:06.460
or any system that the
timestamps come along is this

285
00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:08.800
metadata that's plugged in. I
didn't realize that it was

286
00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:14.380
creating Yeah. Anything that you
have that's being input into

287
00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:18.640
ops usually has a timestamp
associated within whether it be

288
00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:22.540
video or audio. Like if
exempt, for example, if you're

289
00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:27.730
capturing, if you add like
an audio source, let's say

290
00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:29.950
you go into audio settings
and you say, you want

291
00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:33.280
to capture desktop audio. And
that desktop audio will come

292
00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:36.250
in with a timestamp associated
with it, each audio segment.

293
00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:40.480
Hmm. And that is at
high enough resolution that timestamp,

294
00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:42.880
like they don't have different
flavors of timestamps. They have

295
00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:45.850
enough resolution in the, in
the audio that you can

296
00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:49.330
make frame level decisions on.
Well, I mean, there are

297
00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:55.120
some sources that have like
different types of, or different

298
00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:58.420
forms of timestamp. Like for
example, the desktop audio is

299
00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:05.410
captured in a hundred nanosecond
timestamps and the OBS itself

300
00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:08.590
operates at nanosecond. And so
you have to adjust that

301
00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:12.010
to nanosecond, you know, and
things like that. And the

302
00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:16.330
other sources may operate on
some other value and you

303
00:17:16.330 --> 00:17:18.970
have to convert that the
nanosecond before you use it.

304
00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:21.850
And you know, things like
that, Hey friends, you know

305
00:17:21.850 --> 00:17:24.010
how I love great podcasts.
And I want you to

306
00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:27.520
check out the code newbie
podcasts, all about stories from

307
00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:31.600
folks on their coding journey.
They talk to new developers,

308
00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:34.180
experienced developers and everyone in
between about how they got

309
00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:38.020
started learning to code how
they navigate their technical careers.

310
00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:41.050
And they also do deep
dives into technical topics in

311
00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:45.640
a newbie friendly way, check
out their podcast at www

312
00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:52.650
dot code newbie that's any
w B I e.org/podcast. That's

313
00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:57.060
code newbie.org/podcast. When you started
this, you said it was

314
00:17:57.060 --> 00:18:01.460
windows only, and then you
went cross platform. How, how

315
00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:06.060
nightmarish was that? You know,
how many nightmares you went

316
00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:09.270
from calling wind 32 directly
to deciding which shared objects

317
00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:11.040
you needed to call on
Linux and what was the

318
00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:14.750
associated. Yeah, Yeah, yeah. I
did it for, I did

319
00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:17.870
it pretty much for fun
and because I just wanted

320
00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:20.690
to get more developers involved
in the project because you

321
00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:22.730
know, there are a whole
bunch of Linux developers out

322
00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:26.090
there who are just so
talented, you know, that I've,

323
00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:30.830
I've come to see and
even Mac developers, although Mac

324
00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:33.170
has been kind of on
the low side in terms

325
00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:37.190
of support, but I'm, that's
another story, but yeah, it's,

326
00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:39.890
it's been a nightmare. I'd
say that Mac has been

327
00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:43.400
like the most troublesome operating
system to work with. Because

328
00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:48.500
pretty much if you're writing
a native application for a

329
00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:54.440
Mac iOS specifically, Apple will
basically deprecate things like, and

330
00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:56.360
you won't be able to
use them anymore. And they'll,

331
00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:59.540
they deprecate things so fast
and so aggressively. And in

332
00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:02.900
comparison to like say Microsoft,
who will let things fly

333
00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:06.710
for like 20 years, Apple
will like kill things off

334
00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:08.810
after like two or three
years, if they really want

335
00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:12.060
to. And they just have
no like, discretion about it.

336
00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:14.810
It's like, okay, we're doing
this now. Everybody's going to

337
00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:16.760
have to get used to
it. And it's like, Oh,

338
00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:21.170
everybody's like unison. I'm like,
Oh, that's like Painful to

339
00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:24.140
hear. Cause you know, my
day job, I work at

340
00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:29.090
Microsoft and I'm like, VisiCalc
runs on windows still because

341
00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:31.100
you know, if we removed
it, someone would email, I

342
00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:33.440
don't know, bill Gates or
Satya and say you broke

343
00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:36.380
physical. All right, I'll put
that API back. But like

344
00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:38.510
Mac, I have a Mac
mini and like one day

345
00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:41.300
I just stopped getting support
and it's like, it's dead.

346
00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:44.780
It's on snow leopard. Yeah.
It's a, they don't care

347
00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:47.750
yet. I'm not going to
say they don't care. They're

348
00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:53.420
just very aggressive, very aggressive.
You know? And the next

349
00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:55.640
thing that we have to
deal with is a there's

350
00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:57.200
two, two new things that
we have to deal with.

351
00:19:57.230 --> 00:20:01.400
They're deprecating open GL, which
basically kills our entire graphics

352
00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:04.190
subsystem. And then they're going
to switch to arm, you

353
00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:07.790
know, which is, you know,
I got a dev kit

354
00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:10.790
for that, but Hey, yeah.
That's not going to be

355
00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:14.210
fun. I was going to
say, when you said earlier

356
00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:17.270
that I switched, you said
I went to a cross

357
00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:21.470
platform for fun, strange idea
of fun. I think I'll

358
00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:23.900
go to arm for fun.
This will be fun. Great.

359
00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:26.990
This is fine. Well, it's
interesting because I've never really

360
00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:29.810
programmed on the arm before.
I've always been 86 programmers.

361
00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:32.270
So it's going to be
an interesting new experience. Even

362
00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:36.470
if it is a pain,
you know, they're like pain

363
00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:40.700
is like a, another side
of a coin and or

364
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.740
one side of the coin
and the other side is

365
00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:46.190
pleasure. So, you know, it's
like, yeah, you could look

366
00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:51.850
at it though. What is
the thing about pain? Is

367
00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:54.520
weakness leaving the body? I
don't know if that applies

368
00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:57.070
to arm ports, but I'll
be very excited to talk

369
00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:59.290
to you in a couple
of years or months whenever

370
00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:02.520
you get it moving onto,
onto arm. Yeah. I'm pretty

371
00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:06.420
sure we'll be able to
get it pretty soon. I'm

372
00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:09.120
pretty sure that I could
probably just that the only

373
00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:13.480
real problem is just converting
our intrinsics and any assemblies

374
00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:16.260
stuff, but that's pretty much
it, there isn't too much

375
00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:18.540
of that. So I feel
like there shouldn't be too

376
00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:21.330
much of a problem. So
it feels like the last

377
00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:23.520
three or four months as
we opened, we talked about

378
00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:27.120
kind of how the world
has changed. OBS was doing

379
00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:30.420
great. I mean, with the
rise of, of game streaming

380
00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:32.250
with the twitches and the
mixers and the whatnot's of

381
00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:36.060
the world OBS was doing
well. And then out of

382
00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:41.640
nowhere, covert happened. And I
went from being an OBS

383
00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:44.940
user user to being an
OBS studio teacher. And now

384
00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:49.260
I'm constantly every day setting
up another new person with

385
00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:51.960
it. Did you have any
idea that this would become

386
00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:55.680
the, the powerhouse that it
is for video conferencing and

387
00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:59.850
remote work? I did not.
And it's kind of blows

388
00:21:59.850 --> 00:22:02.790
my mind. You know, when
I first wrote the program,

389
00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:05.160
people had been asking me
for to write like a

390
00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:07.380
virtual camera and I was
like, no, I don't want

391
00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:10.350
to work with direct show
anymore because I already wrote

392
00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:12.960
like the direct show input,
you know, where you can

393
00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:15.810
take input from devices, you
know, it's how you capture

394
00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:18.720
like your webcams and stuff
like that on a windows

395
00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:22.200
and direct show is a
serious pain. I haven't had

396
00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:24.750
to do way too much
programming and direct show and

397
00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:28.170
it's just extremely unpleasant. So
I've always avoided it. You

398
00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:30.690
know, I've said somebody else
can do it. And eventually

399
00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:36.090
somebody else did a, another
contributor wrote his own plugin

400
00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:38.970
for it. It ended up
being really popular and now

401
00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:42.960
it's like incredibly popular. And
so me and the guys,

402
00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:45.420
the other guys on the
project, the core guys on

403
00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:48.900
the project decided, you know,
we've really got to have

404
00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:51.060
this integrated in the project.
And I was just like,

405
00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:56.880
Okay. And I ended up
having to write it and

406
00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:01.230
you know, I, I took
the code and I like

407
00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:06.150
tried to adapt it, you
know, and things like that.

408
00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:09.210
So yeah, if we're going
to have a virtual camera

409
00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:13.440
in the next version, so
integrated directly into the program,

410
00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:15.960
so you won't have to
necessarily download like a third

411
00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:18.000
party plugin just to be
able to use it as

412
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:23.340
a, in your conferencing software.
But yeah, it was, it

413
00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:26.880
was a bit unexpected, especially
with how many users started

414
00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:29.250
using an after COVID it
was just blew my mind.

415
00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:33.720
Like we had like three
times the amount of users

416
00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:36.210
that we've had before. And
it's just like so many,

417
00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:39.930
so many users per day.
And just, it's just astounding.

418
00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:42.030
How do you know that,
that, do you have a

419
00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:44.100
kind of telemetry or how
do you know that these,

420
00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:47.570
that the public is suddenly
burst? Did you see the

421
00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:49.100
download numbers and you go,
Oh my goodness. Where do

422
00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:52.180
you see the questions on
the forums? We have an

423
00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:55.570
auto updater in the program
that pings our, our server

424
00:23:55.570 --> 00:23:58.930
whenever the program starts up.
So we basically get a

425
00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:02.620
ping and that's pretty much
it all, whenever the program

426
00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:04.660
starts up. So we have
a pretty good idea of

427
00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:07.450
how many people are using
the program per day. Wow.

428
00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:09.430
And then just to kind
of like over the course

429
00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:11.530
of a couple of months,
it went, it kind of

430
00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:15.010
effectively went viral. Yeah. It
just skyrocketed. It was just

431
00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:18.400
crazy. I couldn't believe it.
Yeah. I wrote an article

432
00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:20.620
about how to set up
the virtual cam and then

433
00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:24.220
how to set up the,
the NDI tools. Do you

434
00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:26.230
have a relationship with that
company or how that works?

435
00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:27.850
Cause they don't, they're not
open source. They're a whole

436
00:24:27.850 --> 00:24:31.480
thing. Oh, you mean the
people, you mean new tech

437
00:24:31.690 --> 00:24:34.840
is one of your techs.
Pardon me? NewTek makes NBI

438
00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:39.100
tools. Yeah. Yeah. I've definitely
communicated with them a few

439
00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:43.270
times. I've, it's, it's kind
of hard. We don't distribute

440
00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:46.930
it with our program because
they're a proprietary tool and

441
00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:50.950
right. Yeah. So we, I
don't want to take responsibility

442
00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:56.560
for distributing any sort of
anything that requires dependence upon

443
00:24:57.550 --> 00:25:01.120
proprietary software like that. And
so I've been just kind

444
00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:04.000
of keeping hands-off now there
is a, there is a

445
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.810
plugin that somebody wrote to
make NDI work, but I'm

446
00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:12.220
just in terms of like
a licensed compatibility, it's kind

447
00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:14.980
of in a gray area.
Right. And so I just

448
00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:17.920
kind of keep hands off
on that one. I would

449
00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:22.180
w I really wish that
I can have NDI directly

450
00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:25.330
integrated into the program. I'm
just a little bit hesitant

451
00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:28.010
at the moment until like,
I can get like a

452
00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:31.450
affirm, go ahead from like
a legal counsel or something

453
00:25:31.450 --> 00:25:33.820
like that. Oh, right, right.
Right. I know that like

454
00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:36.670
Skype for desktop has like
the end. They redistribute that

455
00:25:36.670 --> 00:25:39.610
NDI, TX dot DLL, and
that's kind of where it

456
00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:41.920
all happens and it is
kind of a gray area,

457
00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:43.750
but what's what I'm hearing
you say is that in

458
00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:46.870
the next version a is
a twenties version, 26 of

459
00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:50.230
OBS you'll have that virtual
cam built in and that's

460
00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:52.480
going to be basically make
it, so you download it

461
00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:54.070
and it works right out
of the box for folks

462
00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:58.240
that have that webcam knee.
Yeah. Yeah. Just to be

463
00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:01.900
more specific. It's the virtual
camera is basically, as it

464
00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:06.040
sounds, it's, you're able to
use OBS as a camera

465
00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:09.280
with another program, so you
can select, so when you

466
00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:12.670
select your webcam and like
any other program, you'll be

467
00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:15.520
able to go like Microsoft
teams, for example, you can

468
00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:18.160
go down and you'll see
OBS camera, and you can

469
00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:20.890
just select it and it'll
just get automatically get the

470
00:26:20.890 --> 00:26:24.610
OBS output for you. And
as speaking as a user

471
00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:26.680
for folks that may not
have played with this before,

472
00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:30.670
what's great about this is
a, I have now three

473
00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:33.280
webcams, including one that points
at my desk. So if

474
00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:36.460
I'm doing hardware, demonstrations, or
I want to point down

475
00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:39.190
to my soldering iron, I
can just push a little

476
00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:42.520
button and switch my scene.
And then I'm suddenly looking

477
00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:44.910
at another, but I didn't
have to change anything in

478
00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:47.850
the app. So zoom teams,
Skype, whatever it is that

479
00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:50.940
you're doing, you get this
lovely transition. And once you've

480
00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:53.850
started doing transitions in scenes,
you're going to be hooked

481
00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:56.870
and you'll be an OBS
user for life. Yeah. It's,

482
00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:59.740
it's a lot of fun
and it's a very customizable,

483
00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:02.120
yeah. There's a whole different
bunch of transitions you can

484
00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:04.940
choose from. And it's just
gotten a whole bunch of

485
00:27:05.150 --> 00:27:08.960
fancy little features and things
like that. And so many

486
00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:13.190
awesome features like that, that
are contributed by the, that

487
00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:19.450
are contributed by the other
contributors. And it's, it's, it's,

488
00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:22.130
it's wonderful. I love the
program and I love the

489
00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:25.040
community. One of the plugins
that I think has amazed

490
00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:26.960
me the most, just for
you to like hear from

491
00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:30.160
a user, what we appreciate
about the community is a

492
00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:33.320
web socket server, because I
can't leave the house and

493
00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:36.170
my, my producer can't leave
the house. So I set

494
00:27:36.170 --> 00:27:38.000
up a stream deck so
I can push a button.

495
00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.550
A stream deck is just
a little big old pile

496
00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:42.410
of buttons and I can
push them. And I said,

497
00:27:42.410 --> 00:27:44.150
you know, I really wish
someone else could push these

498
00:27:44.150 --> 00:27:46.430
buttons. Cause if I'm interviewing
someone, I don't want to

499
00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:49.160
do that. So he goes
to a website and we're

500
00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:52.100
both on the same sub-net
and he now has virtual

501
00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:54.920
buttons and he's in Seattle
and I'm in Portland and

502
00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:57.830
I can record a whole
show and he'll hit buttons

503
00:27:57.830 --> 00:28:02.240
on his side, changing scenes
in OBS. And it's completely

504
00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:05.240
changed our production workflow because
we really don't have to

505
00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:09.350
do any more editing. Yeah.
It's like I said, Hey,

506
00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:11.690
just goes back to the
beginning of our conversation. Like

507
00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:14.390
people just making these wonderful
ad-ons and things like that.

508
00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:18.980
It's, it's funny. The stream
deck is another one I

509
00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:25.640
was gonna mention. It's crazy
that companies are making hardware

510
00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:31.700
that basically integrates with the
software and controls it. You

511
00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:35.390
know, it's like, it just
blows my mind that, you

512
00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:39.110
know, that there's like this
ecosystem around my program, you

513
00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:41.090
know, I just never would
have thought that this sort

514
00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:42.800
of thing would have ever
happened. You know, it's not

515
00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:45.950
just like the, the open
source community, but it's like

516
00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:49.850
companies and things like that.
And it just blows my

517
00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:54.050
mind. And speaking of the
web, the web socket and

518
00:28:54.050 --> 00:28:57.920
the NDI plugins, those are
made by a wonderful contributor

519
00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:01.550
called <inaudible>. I just wanted
to shout them out because

520
00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:08.480
he is absolutely wonderful person,
wonderful, wonderful developer. And those

521
00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:12.680
plugins are pretty much the
top plugins for the project.

522
00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:16.190
That is really very thoughtful
For you to do that.

523
00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:20.360
Politeness of course, is Stefan
Levine from France, an active

524
00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:23.750
member of the community all
over the forums, always being

525
00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:26.960
helpful and helping to move
things, move things forward. It's

526
00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:29.150
interesting, you know, there's lots
of plugins, but there is

527
00:29:29.150 --> 00:29:31.580
also a long tail of
plugins, right? There's the top

528
00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:34.520
kind of five or six
essentials. And then there's all

529
00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:37.550
this other diverse bunch of
plugins to, to choose from.

530
00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:40.850
I'm curious how you feel
about the ecosystem in that

531
00:29:40.850 --> 00:29:45.820
you've profit companies, new tech
stream deck building on top

532
00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:48.490
of this thing, but you
haven't chosen to kind of

533
00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:51.310
cash in on, on OBS.
You have a Patrion, you

534
00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:54.430
have an open collective people
can support you and your

535
00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:58.920
community, but you didn't take
a giant check. Well, When

536
00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:03.510
it comes to open source
software, it's, it's complicated. And

537
00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:05.400
it's like, I want to
take that giant check. I

538
00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:07.250
would love to take that
giant check. I'd be like,

539
00:30:07.290 --> 00:30:08.640
yeah, I would love to
give you a giant check.

540
00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:11.430
He hasn't given me the
money, But if they do

541
00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:13.800
it and it's within the
guidelines, you know, within the

542
00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:17.490
licensed guidelines, then, you know,
it's, it's within the clear

543
00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:20.970
pretty much. So if somebody
makes an awesome plugin or

544
00:30:20.970 --> 00:30:23.550
if a company makes an
awesome tool for the program,

545
00:30:23.610 --> 00:30:26.280
you know, and you know,
if they're making profit off

546
00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:28.890
of it, then in my
humble opinion, more power to

547
00:30:28.890 --> 00:30:31.110
them, I would love for
them to, I would love

548
00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:33.300
for all those companies, you
know, to become sponsors of

549
00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:37.570
the project. Cause you know,
they're definitely benefiting off of

550
00:30:37.570 --> 00:30:42.210
the programs development, but we're
not necessarily forcing anybody. We

551
00:30:42.210 --> 00:30:45.600
definitely, we do get big
sponsors. As you know, we

552
00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:49.170
have a Twitch and Facebook
as two big sponsors right

553
00:30:49.170 --> 00:30:54.450
now, hopefully more in the
future. And you know, I,

554
00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:58.020
we're always looking for more
sponsors and we would absolutely

555
00:30:58.020 --> 00:30:59.970
love to have them. And
we would love to be

556
00:30:59.970 --> 00:31:03.120
able to have more developers
or full time developers on

557
00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:05.430
the project. I plan to
hire one extra full time

558
00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:08.820
developer on the project relatively
soon, I'm waiting for him

559
00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:12.480
to get out of college,
but I would definitely love

560
00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:14.400
to have more people who
are able to do it

561
00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:16.980
full time and be able
to dedicate, or at least

562
00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:20.040
dedicate more of their time
to the project. And so

563
00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:24.960
we're always looking for that
and I understand that that

564
00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:27.600
things are complicated and you
know, I'm not going to

565
00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:30.720
hold it against anybody. You
know, if, if they don't,

566
00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:35.820
you know, necessarily sponsor, but
we would definitely hire, it

567
00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:40.530
would be highly encouraged because
if anybody's making a profit

568
00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:45.210
off of, you know, the
program existing, then hopefully, you

569
00:31:45.210 --> 00:31:49.800
know, they can mutually give
back and hopefully we can

570
00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:53.550
continue to repeat that cycle
so we can help them

571
00:31:53.610 --> 00:31:57.300
to continue having more success.
If we have success, then

572
00:31:57.300 --> 00:31:59.970
we can help them to
have more success. So it's

573
00:31:59.970 --> 00:32:04.350
definitely mutually beneficial for everybody
involved to do that. Yeah.

574
00:32:04.530 --> 00:32:06.450
And I really want the,
for the folks that are

575
00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:08.610
listening as we get towards
the end of our podcast

576
00:32:08.610 --> 00:32:11.550
here, if you have used
OBS, if your organization is

577
00:32:11.550 --> 00:32:14.010
using it, if you're spending
time in it every day,

578
00:32:14.010 --> 00:32:17.250
if it has become an
indispensable part of your workflow,

579
00:32:17.550 --> 00:32:21.000
I would encourage you to
go to opencollective.com/obs project. And

580
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.790
just scroll down to the
part that says contributors. And

581
00:32:23.790 --> 00:32:25.770
you'll see the big ones,
you'll see the logic techs

582
00:32:25.770 --> 00:32:27.600
and the front end masters
and the experts that are

583
00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:29.910
giving, you know, tens of
thousands of dollars. But I

584
00:32:29.910 --> 00:32:31.470
also want to point you
out to folks that are

585
00:32:31.470 --> 00:32:34.740
giving a couple of hundred
bucks because they are individual

586
00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:38.370
users and humans that have
had their lives changed. I

587
00:32:38.370 --> 00:32:41.210
see a contribution, someone to
give a thousand dollars because

588
00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:46.040
your team is allowing them
to live stream events or

589
00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:50.540
their church or their local
community center live streaming things.

590
00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:52.340
And they didn't know it
was possible and they didn't

591
00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:55.070
have to pay so they
are paying, but they're paying

592
00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:58.610
you and your team and
supporting your software. So I

593
00:32:58.610 --> 00:33:00.860
do want to tell you
that I appreciate you coming

594
00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:03.650
on the show. And I
hope that everyone who listens,

595
00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:06.860
who either uses OBS gives
you some money at your,

596
00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:10.040
at your open collective and
folks. Who've just heard about

597
00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:12.230
it. Now on this show,
you get involved in this

598
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:15.740
just wonderful community or a
Patrion, or, you know, we

599
00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:19.040
also have PayPal. We have
you take direct paid file.

600
00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:22.580
I like that. Or if
you're a really big sponsor,

601
00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:26.570
we can work something else
out. That's what we usually

602
00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:29.960
try to do so we
can avoid any unnecessary fees

603
00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:32.420
and things like that. That's
a really great point. So

604
00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:34.760
I'm going to put links
to the Patrion, the open

605
00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:37.940
collective and the PayPal all
in the show notes. And

606
00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:39.860
I would encourage you to
get the word out. Thank

607
00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:41.690
you so much. You Bailey
for chatting with me today.

608
00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:45.380
Sure. Thank you so much.
This has been another episode

609
00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:59.540
of Hanselminutes and we'll see
you again next week. <inaudible>.
