Hi, this is Scott Hanselman.
This is another episode of

11
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.970
Hansel minutes today. I'm talking
with EAA Dario Kuhn. She's

12
00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.630
calling in from Legos, Nigeria.
How are you? Hey, Scott.

13
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.020
I'm really great. So you
are a front end developer.

14
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.860
You're a UX UI designer.
You work for IO out

15
00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.460
of Legos, but you also
have degrees in experimental psychology

16
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.920
and law art. Did you
become a lawyer and then

17
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.520
become a developer? Or how
did that happen? Yeah, this

18
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.480
is something people always ask
me. I actually never practiced

19
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.280
either psychology or law. I
studied psychology as my undergrad,

20
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.490
then I wasn't ready for
the real world. So I

21
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.690
decided, okay, let me do
another degree. And I decided

22
00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.620
to do law cause I
found it interesting. And while

23
00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.600
I was doing law is
kind of when I discovered

24
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.770
that programming and like front
end development was an actual,

25
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.700
real job that people do.
So I was like, wow,

26
00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.250
this is something I kind
of have to pursue. Cause

27
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.320
it's I hadn't been doing
it kind of as a

28
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.060
hobby since I was a
teenager. So I just decided

29
00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.250
once I graduate, I'm going
to try and go for

30
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.100
it. So I never actually
practiced, but I like to

31
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.440
call myself a psychologist slash
lawyer slash developer. That's pretty

32
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.500
amazing. And I would think
though, that being a UX

33
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.540
and UI focused developer, that
understanding psychology would be a

34
00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.580
helpful, helpful thing. Yeah. When
people ask, I usually say,

35
00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.800
Oh, I don't think it
actually helps me at all,

36
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.590
but the more I've thought
about it, I think it

37
00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.540
actually does kind of help,
especially just being able to

38
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.140
empathize a bit more with
the user and just kind

39
00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:42.020
of the whole concept of
user research and just trying

40
00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.540
to kind of understand the
user's perspective a bit more.

41
00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.480
I think it's helped because
I know how to do

42
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.140
studies with other human beings.
I've done that kind of

43
00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.860
thing before. So I think
that aspect has helped me

44
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.280
Yeah. The soft skills and
the hard skills. Yeah, exactly.

45
00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.370
So one of the things
that I wanted to talk

46
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.130
to you about is this
concept that I'm seeing a

47
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.660
lot of online, I'm hearing
about the next billion users.

48
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.490
And I want to understand
what exactly that means. Yeah.

49
00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.420
So the next billion users
is a term I heard,

50
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.730
I think it was at
Google IO last year for

51
00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.730
the first time. So it
was essentially as far as

52
00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.820
I know, coined by Google.
And if you think of

53
00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.720
a company like Google, for
example, like over the last,

54
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.300
I don't know, 20 years,
however long the internet has

55
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.140
been a real thing. The
users of any major product

56
00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.480
like Google or whatever products
were available were mainly just

57
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.980
people, mainly people in like
Western countries and people who

58
00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.030
were rich enough to have
access to a computer and

59
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.630
access to the internet. So
if you think about that

60
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.810
kind of user base, as
compared to now, it's completely

61
00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.710
different because it was a
very, very narrow user base.

62
00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.680
But like I said, if
you compare that to now,

63
00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.250
it's almost a completely different
story. You have so many

64
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.120
more people coming online from
so many different countries, so

65
00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.320
many different just walks of
life, essentially. So I think

66
00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:18.450
the whole next billion users
concept is kind of acknowledging

67
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:23.430
this shift in user base
and acknowledging that there's a

68
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.060
whole new set of people
who are just coming online

69
00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.110
or just really getting comfortable
online that are going to

70
00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.560
be using these products that
were previously pretty much only

71
00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.000
built for that previous narrow
user base. So it's just

72
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.600
about changing your mindsets and
thinking about who your users

73
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.560
actually are because chances are,
if you built a product

74
00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.250
five, 10 years ago, you're
building it for a completely

75
00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.710
different user base than exists
today. Yeah. The first billion

76
00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.540
users, I guess there's about
3 billion people that like have

77
00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.680
smartphones, but the first billion
people probably were like, like

78
00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.490
me, they got online 20
plus years ago, we got

79
00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:13.020
on via AOL America online
or dial up. And the

80
00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:18.420
next billion will probably be
not in, in Portland or

81
00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:22.350
New York or in London, but
in, in South America or

82
00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.330
in Southeast Asia or in
Africa and there'll be on

83
00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.420
a smartphone, won't they? Yeah,
that's actually a really good

84
00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:31.530
point. The whole shift in
mobile versus desktop as well,

85
00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.310
like even five years ago,
it was pretty much when

86
00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.340
you're building a site or
building anything. It's mainly for

87
00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.700
people sitting down at a
desk, but now you have

88
00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.590
to build for people who
are on the go or

89
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.820
people who are just managing
their entire lives through like

90
00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:50.850
a four inch screen or
however big their smartphone is.

91
00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.180
So it's really, it's like
a huge shift really in

92
00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.520
the way that we have
to think about how we're

93
00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.810
building products, Blog posts about
the next billion users that

94
00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.890
on Google says that these
billion users are already starting

95
00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:08.800
to change the internet. Then
you point out this mobile

96
00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.970
only mindset. Like they don't
have computers at their, at

97
00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:14.890
their home. They don't have
a laptop of any kind.

98
00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:16.990
I don't know if I
can say, Oh, they don't

99
00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:20.890
have a computer, but I
can speak of my experience

100
00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:24.670
of seeing a lot of
people here in Nigeria. A

101
00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:28.570
lot of people I personally
see their main device is

102
00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.660
their mobile device. Maybe they
have a tablets, but their

103
00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.660
main device is their mobile
device. And one of the

104
00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:38.980
main reasons for that is
because we struggle a lot,

105
00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:41.620
especially in Nigeria because we
have a lot of government

106
00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:47.560
issues. We struggle a lot
with power. So having something

107
00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.800
like a laptop that is,
I mean, compared to a

108
00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.920
mobile phone or a tablet
is much more dependent on

109
00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:58.660
like a power source is
a lot more unreliable than

110
00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:01.180
just having a mobile phone
that you can like carry

111
00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.480
around with you. And it
lasts for longer than like

112
00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:07.510
a laptop or like a
desktop would like you can't

113
00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:10.360
even use a desktop because
it would be too reliant

114
00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:13.660
on power. So I think
that's one of the reasons

115
00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:17.140
why a lot of people
tend to focus on mobile

116
00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:20.620
devices. But obviously another reason
is that it's a lot

117
00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:24.280
cheaper. And for the things
that the average person wants

118
00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:27.550
to do, someone that's not
like a developer like myself

119
00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:30.490
that is trying to do
something that's really, really heavy

120
00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:34.540
on processing and all the
fat. So the average president

121
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:39.460
that just wants emails and
Facebook and WhatsApp, there's no

122
00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:41.950
need to have a whole
computer. You can just do

123
00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:45.220
all of that from your
phone. So that's why I

124
00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:48.040
think that's a lot for
a lot of people, their

125
00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:50.950
first device and maybe their
only device is going to

126
00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:53.890
be a mobile device. So
even if they do have

127
00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:57.310
a laptop, it probably wouldn't
be their primary device, unless

128
00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:00.700
they are like a working
professional that needs that as

129
00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:05.140
their primary device. Interesting. That's
a really interesting way to

130
00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:07.090
put it. It's not that
they don't necessarily have a

131
00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:09.670
laptop or have access to
a computer. It's not their

132
00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:12.670
primary device. And that's funny
that you say that because

133
00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:15.040
even though I'm sitting here
and we're both chatting to

134
00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:18.760
each other on computers, I
probably spend as much time

135
00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.430
if not more on my
phone. So one could argue

136
00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:25.330
that my, my iPhone is
my primary device. Yeah. That's

137
00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:27.490
actually a really good point.
I didn't think of it

138
00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:30.370
that way because I mean,
if you asked me to

139
00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:34.120
do 24 hours without my
phone or 25 hours without

140
00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:37.660
my laptop, you would probably
say I need my phone.

141
00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:40.720
So I think for a
lot of people, it is

142
00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:44.110
their phone. Their phone is
the primary device. Even if

143
00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:47.620
like, like you or me,
they primarily work on their

144
00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:51.940
laptop. So it's actually, it's
actually, you're right. It's not

145
00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:57.030
that like specific to the
next billion users that their

146
00:08:57.030 --> 00:09:00.060
mobile device with the primary
device. And if you think

147
00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:02.730
about it, you're doing more
and more things on your

148
00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:07.260
phone like previously, I mean,
you wouldn't have even imagined

149
00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.050
doing things like email on
your phone because it might've

150
00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:12.570
been too difficult to type
in or something like that.

151
00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:16.200
But now, I mean, I
think we all do things

152
00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:19.950
more and more important things
on these smaller mobile devices,

153
00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:25.150
Which is interesting because I
still don't see in, in

154
00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.140
least in the, on the
websites that I go to

155
00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:31.280
a mobile first mindset, we've
been hearing mobile first now

156
00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:33.890
for quite a few years.
But you know, if I

157
00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:37.100
go visit like my favorite
news site for tech, which

158
00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:40.700
is the verge, it's like
a seven or eight megabytes

159
00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:43.100
just for the homepage and
most of it's JavaScript and

160
00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:47.750
fat PNGs. Yeah. And I
mean, I think I am

161
00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:52.610
definitely still a bit like
guilty of this myself. It's

162
00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:56.780
almost as if us, as
the developers, the people making

163
00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:59.420
all of this online content,
it's like almost like we're

164
00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:02.900
in denial about, about the
fact that most people are

165
00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:05.660
now kind of shifting to
mobile and we just kind

166
00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:09.980
of want to serve this
desktop feel. And like I

167
00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:13.520
said, I'm definitely a bit
I'm guilty of this myself.

168
00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:15.860
I mean, when I'm trying
to design something, I love

169
00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:20.480
designing desktop first, even though
I know that mobile is

170
00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:23.120
probably going to be the
most important in a lot

171
00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:26.600
of situations, but I think
every people are becoming more

172
00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:30.350
and more aware and the
whole mobile first thing is

173
00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:34.340
definitely has taken, has really
taken off and more people

174
00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:37.880
are, even though they might
not be putting as much

175
00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:41.360
weight on mobile assets reserves,
they're definitely putting a lot

176
00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:45.650
more than they used to.
It seems like it is

177
00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:50.120
an exercise in empathy. Like
I would assume given that

178
00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.040
I'm here on the West
coast of the U, the

179
00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.380
U S and I have
a nice big computer and

180
00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:58.760
a fast bandwidth that, that
you era in Nigeria would

181
00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:02.510
be seeing people living a
mobile first lifestyle so that

182
00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:06.020
you would naturally design that
way, but you also have

183
00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:08.690
fast internet and a nice
big computer and I'm nice

184
00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:13.490
big monitor. So you can
catch yourself being desktop first

185
00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:16.640
and, and being high bandwidth
first, even though you are

186
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:21.560
closer to the, the next
billion users. Yeah, exactly. I

187
00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:26.000
think it's actually more because
obviously as a developer, most

188
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.620
of my world is still
online. Like when I'm talking

189
00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:34.010
about all my colleagues or
people I interact with in

190
00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:37.880
my working environment, they're mostly
people all around the world.

191
00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:41.750
So it can be easy
to think in their mindsets

192
00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:44.780
rather than think in the
mindset of, Oh, I'm building

193
00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:49.640
a product specifically for people
in this country. And I

194
00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:52.130
dealt a lot with this
in my previous job where

195
00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:54.940
I worked with the media
company here based in Nigeria.

196
00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:58.690
And I think the biggest
shock for me when I

197
00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:01.720
was working there was when
I realized that like quite

198
00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:05.350
a significant percentage of people
were using opera mini browser.

199
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:09.190
So that really freaked me
out because if like, for

200
00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:11.770
people that don't know, opera
mini is very, it's a

201
00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:14.800
very stripped back browser. So
there are so many things

202
00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:20.380
like JavaScript or CSS features
that just basically don't work.

203
00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:23.650
So I mean, what I
would suggest to everyone is

204
00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:26.020
to kind of just download
opera mini on their phone

205
00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:28.720
and just open up whatever
site they're currently working on

206
00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:33.490
in that browser. And I
guarantee you you'll like gasp,

207
00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:37.780
cause I definitely did. I
was like, Whoa. And that

208
00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:40.690
was kind of, kind of
a shock for me. And

209
00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:43.480
it kind of just shocked
me back into reality and

210
00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:46.780
realizing, Oh, I can't just
be building for people who

211
00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:49.870
have the phone that I
have. I need to think

212
00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:53.080
more about the actual users.
And that's kind of where

213
00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:58.440
the whole empathy thing plays
into. Yeah. Opera mini is,

214
00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:00.390
it's funny. You bring that
up because that's something that

215
00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:03.870
I have not thought about
in many, many years, but

216
00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:06.480
I think it's worth both
of us pointing out that

217
00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:11.430
the next billion users, it's
not necessarily a euphemism for,

218
00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:14.280
Oh, there'll be a billion
Africans or a billion Asians

219
00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:17.640
or billions South Americans suddenly
on online and the Western

220
00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:20.370
people should start thinking about
it. There are a billion

221
00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:22.680
new users coming on that
are from all over the

222
00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:27.210
world. My brother, as an
example, lives in rural Oregon.

223
00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:31.110
He just recently got internet
there because he can't get

224
00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:33.930
fiber. There's no cable there.
So he actually has a

225
00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:37.590
cell phone connection. That's sitting
on top of his roof

226
00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:40.980
on his barn and then
that puts wifi out. But

227
00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:45.900
he only has a three
gigabytes a month bandwidth. Oh

228
00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:48.600
wow. So I asked him
what browser he was using.

229
00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:51.840
And he was using opera
mini because apparently they compress

230
00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:56.100
images and pages a second
time and he found that

231
00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:59.910
it saved him on bandwidth.
So here's someone 35 miles

232
00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:04.620
South of me who is
the living. What most, most

233
00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:08.310
connected Americans would think is
a, is a primitive lifestyle.

234
00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:10.560
But in fact, there's a
lot of people like that

235
00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:14.970
in your country, whoever you
are listening to this podcast

236
00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:18.450
that are not as connected
as you are. Yeah. That's

237
00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:22.320
a really good point. Cause
whenever people say next billion

238
00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:25.200
users, like you said, people
tend to think of, Oh,

239
00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:30.270
just Africans or something coming
online. They've never seen anything.

240
00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:33.330
So they tend to, I
mean, I know that it

241
00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:36.480
can be easy to have
that mindset, that these are

242
00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:40.170
people who live in very,
very rural areas or people

243
00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:43.020
who like, I don't know,
live in Hudson or something,

244
00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:45.240
which is typically what people
tend to think when they

245
00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:50.580
think of like the average,
poor African person, but the

246
00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:54.140
whole next users thing. Isn't
just about that. I mean,

247
00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:57.680
that is obviously one aspect
of it. People who couldn't

248
00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:01.640
come online before because of
like financial issues or things

249
00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:05.270
like that. But there are
many, many, many different other

250
00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:10.640
people that this whole next
billion users concept covers. So

251
00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:14.480
you have things from, like
you said, people who live

252
00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:18.020
in Western or festivals or
however you want to call

253
00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:21.470
it countries who just couldn't
come online for, I don't

254
00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:24.770
know, logistical reasons like your
brother, for example. And you

255
00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:29.690
could also have people who
couldn't come online because of

256
00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:33.320
accessibility reasons, for example. So
there are a lot of

257
00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:36.470
things, a lot of assistive
technology, which is coming up

258
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:39.200
now. So screen readers are
getting so much better and

259
00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:42.710
that's enabling people who couldn't
come online because maybe they

260
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:46.640
have visual impairment or any
other form of difficulties like

261
00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:49.250
that. And that, isn't what
you might think when you

262
00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:52.130
think of Nick a billion
users. But that is, that

263
00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:54.530
is like a category of
people who are just being

264
00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:58.100
able to come online now
because technology has gotten so

265
00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:01.490
much better. So when I
think of next billion users,

266
00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:04.760
I try not to restrict
it to just the people

267
00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:07.910
that are like just around
me that I might be

268
00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:12.380
immediately concerned about. But it's
more about just taking a

269
00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:16.100
global view of who your
users can be. I no

270
00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:18.920
longer just thinking that it
could be the small subset

271
00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:21.170
of people. You have to
just open your mind more

272
00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:23.780
and think about all the
different people that exist in

273
00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:26.670
the world, because pretty much
all of those people are

274
00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:29.800
gonna be able to come
at nine very soon. Exactly.

275
00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:31.770
And if we assume that
everyone, if we'd not none

276
00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:34.150
assume, but if we agree
that everyone deserves to be

277
00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:37.720
online, then if there's small
things that we can do

278
00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:40.810
to, to make their lives
easier, then we should do

279
00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:44.530
those things. For example, I
started, I had met a

280
00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:50.020
number of blind software developers
at Microsoft. And for the

281
00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:53.740
last several years, I always
include alt tags on my,

282
00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:56.350
on my images, on my
blog. And even Twitter now

283
00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:58.750
lets you put an alternative
tag on images when you

284
00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:02.170
post them. Because I saw
someone tweet that as a

285
00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:05.650
blind person, they just scroll
past those things. Like if

286
00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:07.330
I can't see your image
and you didn't bother to

287
00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:10.180
describe it, I'm just going
to ignore your content entirely.

288
00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:12.310
And it doesn't take 10
seconds for me to fix

289
00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:16.360
it. Yeah. That's why I'm
like, we both said the

290
00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:19.990
empathy thing is an important
aspect of it. It's just

291
00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:22.990
about putting yourself in the
position of someone who isn't

292
00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:28.150
having the exact same experience
that you are and I've

293
00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:31.270
had similar experiences like you
as well, like realizing, Oh

294
00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:34.060
you can now put old
texts in your Twitter images.

295
00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:37.000
So that's something that I've
tried to do now as

296
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.780
well. And I always include
all texts in when I'm

297
00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:44.470
writing, like my blog articles.
Yeah. That's, that's a small

298
00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:50.070
thing. So I've heard accessibility
is important. What about local

299
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:53.400
languages? How important is internationalization
when we're thinking about the

300
00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:56.430
next billion, Hey folks, I
want to take a moment

301
00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:58.800
to thank our sponsors and
remind you that when you

302
00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:02.250
support them, you're supporting Hanselman
it's because they make this

303
00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:06.840
show possible. Innovative developers help
improve the lives of millions

304
00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:10.920
of small businesses and accountants
that use QuickBooks worldwide. Your

305
00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:13.410
app could make the difference
that helps them work smarter

306
00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:17.730
and put more money in
their pocket. Enter Intuit developer

307
00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:21.030
from tech tools to growing
your customer base, to helping

308
00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:24.810
you get funding. Intuit developer

more at intuit.me/code that's I

310
00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:39.080
N T U I t.me/code
Internationalization is also a really

311
00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:42.440
important thing when I'm thinking
about like building on the

312
00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:47.810
global scale. Because as someone
from a primarily English speaking

313
00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:50.780
place, it can be very
easy to just think that

314
00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:55.760
the whole world speaks English.
And especially when like the

315
00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.160
U S is an English
speaking place and the U

316
00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:00.380
S tends to dominate a
lot of things online as

317
00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:03.830
well. But particularly through working
at IO, I've kind of

318
00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:07.070
had my eyes opened a
bit more to that because

319
00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:09.410
a lot of the websites
that we do are all

320
00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:12.410
translated and it's just made
me think and made me

321
00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:15.890
much more aware of things
that I typically may not

322
00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:19.280
have thought of. Like something
as simple as making sure

323
00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:22.220
that the site can work,
the languages left to right,

324
00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:25.310
and right to left. Those
are things that, I mean,

325
00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:28.910
I probably haven't really tested
ever before, but now I'm

326
00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:31.580
getting more aware of it
and it doesn't even have

327
00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:35.570
to be as big or
as much work as making

328
00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:39.290
your site work. Both directions,
something as simple as just

329
00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:43.310
in the document title, adding
what language, the document in

330
00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:46.160
goes like a long, long
way. So there are very

331
00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:50.180
simple things that you can
do to improve the site

332
00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:54.890
for someone who isn't like
from an English speaking country.

333
00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:58.730
And it doesn't have to
necessarily be as it doesn't

334
00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:01.100
have to be that big
they're little things to big

335
00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:03.560
things that you can do.
Why is the company that

336
00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:06.830
you're working at now doing
its things localized more than

337
00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:11.060
where you'd worked previously? Well,
because it's more about the

338
00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:15.140
targets. So the company that
I worked with previously that

339
00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:18.770
I said was a media
company in Nigeria, the content

340
00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:21.800
was all English. So we
didn't necessarily need to think

341
00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:26.840
about people viewing from different
countries. And obviously like if

342
00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:29.630
the company had gotten bigger
than that would be more

343
00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:31.880
of a, more of a
pressing issue, but for the

344
00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:35.270
company I work for now,
which their main product is

345
00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:39.560
Adblock plus, and it's used
by like millions of users.

346
00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:43.790
So it's not only English
speaking users that are, are

347
00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:46.040
users of our products. So
we have to think much

348
00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:52.210
more globally. Ah, Okay. How
important we've talked about performance.

349
00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:55.600
We talked about accessibility. We
talked about internationalization, but how

350
00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:58.300
important is another kind of
diversity that we haven't talked

351
00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:02.980
about, which is device diversity?
I have an iPhone. Do

352
00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:05.710
you have an iPhone? Yeah.
Why shouldn't we just define

353
00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:09.630
design only for iPhones? Well,
I mean, that would be

354
00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:12.900
easier if everyone used the
same everyday, if everyone used

355
00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:15.810
the same device, but I
mean, that's just not the

356
00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:20.340
reality and what we're not
building iOS applications, we're building

357
00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:22.830
websites. And if we're going
to build something for the

358
00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:25.680
web, then we have to
build it to work across

359
00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:29.430
different devices. That's just kind
of like the fact of

360
00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:32.430
the web it's always been
open and hopefully always will

361
00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:35.220
be. And if you're going
to build a website, I

362
00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:38.970
think it's just the responsibility
to build it, to work

363
00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:41.670
across various devices. Cause like
I said, if you didn't

364
00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:44.190
want to do that, then
that's where you can just

365
00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:48.330
put like a native application.
Yeah. My, my brother just

366
00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:52.560
upgraded from a, a flip
phone with internet to a

367
00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:56.490
low end. I think it's
$19 Android. I don't even

368
00:21:56.490 --> 00:22:00.390
know the brand, but it's
like just the, the cheapest

369
00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:03.000
Android he could get because
when he wants to watch

370
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.880
YouTube, he goes to the
local cafe and uses their

371
00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:07.910
internet or he goes to
McDonald's and uses their in

372
00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:09.600
it. Cause he won't, he
doesn't want to use his,

373
00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:13.680
take his three gigabytes of,
of data and use it.

374
00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:16.920
So he doesn't, he doesn't
watch videos even on his

375
00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:19.440
phone. So I wonder if
he could even look at

376
00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:21.420
my podcast site, I have
to check to see if

377
00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:25.620
I've designed for his device,
his lower end device. Yeah.

378
00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:29.070
That's a good point. I
mean, it isn't actually that

379
00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:32.220
much work to make the
site work on lower end

380
00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:35.910
devices because that's kind of
how things work out of

381
00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:39.060
the box. It's more things
that we do that change

382
00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:41.100
those things. So if you're
a building just like a

383
00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:44.460
plain static website, then you
won't really need to worry

384
00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:47.430
about all of these things.
But because obviously we're trying

385
00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:50.430
to build some more and
more complex things. We're using

386
00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:54.840
a JavaScript frameworks and all
these new technologies and that's

387
00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:57.840
kind of why we need
to kind of walk back

388
00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:00.750
and think, Oh, how can
we actually get back to

389
00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:05.850
where we started? Which was
just a simple document. Ah,

390
00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:08.220
that's interesting. What, you know,
one thing that I actually

391
00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:10.080
found that, that you might
be interested in about my

392
00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:14.400
podcast, I changed it recently
to a relatively static site,

393
00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:16.710
but when you click on
episodes and look at the

394
00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:21.660
archives, in fact, you get
600 episodes. Cause there's been

395
00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:25.620
a lot of episodes and
the, those episodes have a

396
00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:30.270
face for all 600, even
though you don't look at

397
00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:32.790
all 600 faces when you
hit the page, I was

398
00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:35.970
loading every single one of
them. So that page weight

399
00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:42.060
was 10 megabytes. Whoa, that
is a lot. Yeah, it

400
00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:44.340
was, it seemed like a
good idea at the time.

401
00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:48.350
But then I up cooking
up a, a tool called

402
00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:50.540
application insights and you know,
there's all different kinds of

403
00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:53.240
tools that will do this.
And it basically tests your

404
00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:58.220
website all over the, all
over the earth. And it

405
00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:01.460
said that people in Bangladesh,
it takes almost 30 seconds

406
00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:03.860
to load this page. So
I went and I did

407
00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:06.680
the, did the research and
it turned out, all I

408
00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:10.580
needed to do was put
in some, some JavaScript that

409
00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:14.690
would load those faces when
they enter the viewport. So

410
00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:17.690
when someone scrolls down, then
I open, it made a

411
00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:21.110
huge difference, but I never
would have known unless I

412
00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:25.220
either ask someone with low
bandwidth or had a tool

413
00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:29.920
tell me that it was
a problem. Yeah, exactly. And

414
00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:34.060
it's actually just really simple.
It's really easy to do

415
00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:39.550
those things that result in
really large page sizes. And

416
00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:42.700
that's kind of why, I
don't know, we have a

417
00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:45.550
lot of power with the
web to do all these

418
00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:47.560
things, but we also have
to try as much as

419
00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:50.980
possible to think about what
we're doing and think about

420
00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:54.010
if we're doing things the
right way, which is what

421
00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:55.990
is kind of difficult, right.
Because we have to go

422
00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:58.420
and research and make sure
we're not just like writing

423
00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:02.020
nonsense. I could, I dunno.
Cause like everything to explode,

424
00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:06.640
so yeah. Yeah. But like
you said, there are lots

425
00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:10.930
of really great tools out
there that will help you

426
00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:13.330
along this road. Like you
don't have to necessarily know

427
00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:16.210
everything yourself. So one thing
I would mention that's really

428
00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:20.560
good is lighthouse, which is
now built into Chrome. I

429
00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:22.480
think if you just open
your dev tools, you can

430
00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:25.960
just run a quick analysis
of your page and it

431
00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:29.320
will bring up any things
that are major that are

432
00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:33.250
wrong with your site in
terms of like performance accessibility,

433
00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:35.980
all of that stuff. So
you don't necessarily have to

434
00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:38.650
know all this stuff yourself.
As long as you have

435
00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:42.010
a few tools that you
could use to just know

436
00:25:42.010 --> 00:25:44.380
if you're on the right
track, then that's good enough.

437
00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:47.170
Oh wow. So I had
no idea. So I just

438
00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:51.220
went into my podcast. I
hit F 12 in Chrome

439
00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:55.090
and I clicked on audits,
AUD I T. And there's

440
00:25:55.090 --> 00:25:58.300
a picture of a lighthouse.
And now it says lighthouses

441
00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:00.550
looking to see what your
website's like on a three

442
00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:03.340
G connection. And it's, it's
doing a whole thing. It's

443
00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:08.590
like a 32nd long process.
Yeah. It's actually really amazing.

444
00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:13.090
It was initially built to
kind of test progressive web

445
00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:15.910
apps in particular. Cause it
also tests things like if

446
00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:19.420
there's a service worker there,
it tests, if your application

447
00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:22.240
or your website rather works
when there's no connection at

448
00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:24.220
all. So it tests if
you have like some kind

449
00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:27.820
of caching strategy, but it's
also good. Like I said,

450
00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:30.520
for the other things like
just performance and making sure

451
00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:33.280
you're not doing anything that's
really, really going to be

452
00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:36.640
detrimental. So I would definitely
suggest for any site you

453
00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:39.310
have just try it out.
I mean, it's free, it's

454
00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:42.190
in Chrome and you can
just have a general idea

455
00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:46.520
of where your is. This
is amazing. So I just

456
00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:49.310
finished and it is telling
me that my SEO is

457
00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:52.250
good and then my best
practices are good. But then

458
00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:56.180
under performance it says, it
took almost three seconds for

459
00:26:56.180 --> 00:27:01.370
the first meaningful paint and
it took five seconds before

460
00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:04.310
it was consistently interactive. So
I have some blocking scripts

461
00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:07.430
that I didn't even know
about. Yeah, exactly. So there

462
00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:09.950
are many things that you
might not even be aware

463
00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:13.640
of that always like whenever
I do that, if something

464
00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:16.880
always comes up that I
maybe would have tested before

465
00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:19.190
and I didn't test this
time. So it will definitely

466
00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:21.410
bring up things that you
might not have even thought

467
00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:24.170
of as well. Yeah, this
is great. It also points

468
00:27:24.170 --> 00:27:26.420
out progressive web apps, which
I know that you're an

469
00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:29.180
expert in that is a
way of making my, you

470
00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:32.360
know, my website feel more
like a web app and

471
00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:35.210
it's giving me all sorts
of tips about maybe changing

472
00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:38.360
the address bar and having
a splash screen and prompting

473
00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:40.880
the user to maybe even
add the web app to

474
00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:43.910
their home screen. I had
no idea this existed. Yeah.

475
00:27:43.910 --> 00:27:48.260
It's really amazing. Right. And
because progressive web apps are

476
00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:51.200
getting so powerful, there are
so many more things you

477
00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:54.890
could do. Like you mentioned
things like almost embodying or

478
00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:58.490
having a similar experience to
what a mobile device or

479
00:27:58.490 --> 00:28:01.040
a mobile application is going
to be like. So things

480
00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:04.160
like having like a splash
screen and also what I

481
00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:09.230
mentioned about having some kind
of offline first strategy. So

482
00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:11.540
those things, it will also
bring up and like suggest

483
00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:13.400
like, Oh, these are things
you can do. And it's

484
00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:17.690
actually surprisingly really easy to
set up these things. Like

485
00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:20.480
just having the splash screen,
all you need is like

486
00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:23.300
a single file, which is
called like a manifest file.

487
00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:26.030
And all you have to
do is like to some

488
00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:28.220
icons that you create and
just say, Oh, you want

489
00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:30.080
it to be full screen.
So you want to hide

490
00:28:30.410 --> 00:28:33.680
the address bar when the
user launches the app. And

491
00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:35.360
all of a sudden you
have what looks like a

492
00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:39.560
completely native application. Yeah. This
looks like something that I

493
00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:41.990
could spend just maybe a
few hours on or maybe

494
00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:44.810
a weekend. And I could
take all of these scores

495
00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:46.820
up into the green. Cause
right now it looks like

496
00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:49.310
three out of five are
our orange, which looks like

497
00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:53.420
a, an almost failing grade.
No, it's not failing until

498
00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:58.010
it's red. Okay. Well I
barely, I am orange, then

499
00:28:58.010 --> 00:29:00.740
I'm almost failing, but this
is a way for me

500
00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:02.870
to hit the next billion
users. I want to make

501
00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:06.410
sure that when someone hits
my site anywhere in the

502
00:29:06.410 --> 00:29:09.080
world, on any device, they
have a great experience. Yeah,

503
00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:12.530
exactly. And why also wants
to say is that it

504
00:29:12.530 --> 00:29:15.680
doesn't have to be like
a hundred percent perfect site

505
00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:18.920
that works for everybody in
every single situation. Like, I

506
00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:21.080
don't know how many sites
there are that actually hit

507
00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:24.350
a hundred out of a
hundred on that lighthouse score,

508
00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:28.460
but you don't necessarily have
to get a hundred. You

509
00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:31.910
should just make little improvements
every day. And that's what

510
00:29:31.910 --> 00:29:35.870
I also say about accessibility
because people tend to get

511
00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:38.510
demoralized or I'm not sure
what the word is like

512
00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:40.160
when they hear that, Oh,
they want to make a

513
00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:43.420
site accessible for screen reader,
users under they think, Oh,

514
00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:45.070
they have to do this.
They have to do that.

515
00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:49.060
But one thing that I
always say is that you

516
00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:50.920
don't have to make it
perfect. You just have to

517
00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:55.750
make like a little improvement.
And if someone who like

518
00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:58.930
is using a screen reader,
couldn't like read anything on

519
00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:01.900
your sites yesterday. But then
today you added some image,

520
00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:03.850
all texts. And all of
a sudden, a few things

521
00:30:03.850 --> 00:30:06.460
are more accessible to them.
Like that is still a

522
00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:09.790
really worthwhile improvement to make.
And it's the same thing

523
00:30:09.790 --> 00:30:14.200
for performance and internationalization. It's
just the little things you

524
00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:17.170
do really do make a
difference. So you shouldn't get

525
00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:20.050
discouraged from thinking you need
to have like a hundred

526
00:30:20.050 --> 00:30:23.050
percent score. You just need
to kind of, I don't

527
00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:26.250
know, get one score up
every day. Very true. Very

528
00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:28.200
true. Well, that gives you
just giving me a task

529
00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:29.760
that I'm going to spend
the rest of my afternoon

530
00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:33.150
fixing and I appreciate that.
Oh, great. Fantastic. Thanks so

531
00:30:33.150 --> 00:30:35.490
much for chatting with me
today. No problem. Thanks for

532
00:30:35.490 --> 00:30:39.120
inviting me. Dario, Coon, you
can find her online on

533
00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:43.380

This has been another episode

534
00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:45.630
