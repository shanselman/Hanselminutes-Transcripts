From hanselminutes.com. It's Hansel minutes,
our weekly discussion With web

9
00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.030
developer and technologist Scott Hanselman.
This is Lawrence Ryan announcing Total

10
00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.990
number four 25. In this
episode, Scott talks with Susie

11
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.220
wheat CTO of networked experiences
at Cisco about shoulder to

12
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:10.250
shoulder, remote collaborations. This is
Scott Hanselman, and this is

13
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.950
another episode of Hansel minutes.
I'm here in San Francisco

14
00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.100
at Cisco DevNet. We're at
the Moscone center West, and

15
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.820
I'm talking with Susie wee.
You're the CTO CTO of

16
00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.300
networked experiences, network experience as
well. I saw some pretty

17
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.560
amazing network experiences hanging out
here at dev net just

18
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.480
as I come up the
escalator. And I turn the

19
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.310
corner. I see not one
but 10 different HDTVs, kind

20
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.020
of in a massive full-sized
body, body height wall. Yep.

21
00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.560
It's almost like a half
a room. It was. What

22
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.080
is that? It's pretty cool.
So that's a, that's one

23
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.470
of our innovation projects is
call it augmented collaboration. So

24
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.570
basically what we're trying to
do is look at, you

25
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.360
know, we have a lot
of great collaboration tools today,

26
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.850
but what could we really
do to get to that

27
00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.230
next generation of collaboration? Like
technology is amazing, but the

28
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.210
question is what kind of
like human problems do we

29
00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.460
want to solve and what
kind of human experiences do

30
00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.100
we want to give? So
what we did was we

31
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.260
actually sat down with kind
of a use case that

32
00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.810
happens all the time, which
is, you know, we had

33
00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.420
a reorg, I had a
new team. First thing we

34
00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.390
did with the new team
was having offsite. And then

35
00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.640
we had an amazing three-day
offsite. And you know, it's

36
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.500
just one of those meetings
where you get all these

37
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.680
people together, people have different
areas they're responsible for, but

38
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.230
everyone's getting to know each
other new team. You have

39
00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.630
to figure out your new
directions. So people broke off

40
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.480
into groups and said, you
know, my user experience team

41
00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.910
said, what are our top
three opportunities? What are top

42
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.270
three quick wins that we
could do? My customer experience,

43
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.480
trials team and my technical
technology innovation team. They all

44
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.400
kind of went to the
side, said, you know, again,

45
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.440
what are top three short
term wins are top three

46
00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.140
longterm opportunities. We brought all
of this together. You know,

47
00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.080
we had like kind of
papers full of brainstorming ideas.

48
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.760
How many people are we
talking about here? And we

49
00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.590
had about a dozen people
there together, all in one

50
00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.380
room, all in one room
and you know, three days.

51
00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.650
And it was an amazing,
like everyone got to know

52
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.560
each other. We came up
with our directions and it's

53
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.630
just like, you go back
to that point. That's where

54
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.720
we set our strategy and
then boom, we executed. And

55
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.350
it was just amazing. But
at that time I was

56
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.680
the CTO, but what we
call CTO, chief technology and

57
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.550
experience officer for collaboration, that
team of folks like we

58
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.450
make WebEx, we make unified
communication, we make telepresence video.

59
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.240
And then we asked ourselves,
why did we have to

60
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.240
meet together in the same
room? This is embarrassing. We've

61
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.310
made some of the world's
best collab products, but we've

62
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.110
met in the room. You
know, did you notice that

63
00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:33.940
at the time it was
that come up, it didn't

64
00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.290
come up at the time
cause we're having such a

65
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.600
great meeting, you know, but
it came up later when,

66
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.840
you know, basically John Chambers is
trying to catalyze innovation at

67
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.390
Cisco and he made this
program called the tech fund,

68
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.300
which he set aside $10 million
so that any technologists could

69
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.000
kind of propose new ideas.
So we're like, Hey, that's

70
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.490
pretty good. Let's propose a
new idea. And we kind

71
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:53.890
of went back to that
situation and we had pictures

72
00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:55.720
of ourselves, you know, it
was such a good meeting.

73
00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.810
And then we're like, okay,
why, why were we all

74
00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.300
in the same room? What
happened there? And so we

75
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.390
thought about it really hard.
And then we said, I

76
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.220
know the reason, the reason
we all had to be

77
00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.190
in the same room is
because we don't have a

78
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.090
product designed around that specific
use case. Like that use

79
00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.300
case where you need to
get people together, brainstorm about

80
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:19.150
our new ideas, break off
into groups, you know, fill

81
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.550
up these, you know, whiteboards
full of ideas and then

82
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:25.030
socialize them and make decisions
together. So there was really

83
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.210
no single product that was
designed for that. Like WebEx

84
00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.160
is great. You know, you
can get like 200 people

85
00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.440
on a phone call. You
can share a presentation, people

86
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.230
can talk, someone can be
in an airport. Some it

87
00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.680
can be in Australia. So
I'm going to be at

88
00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.860
their desk, you know, and
everyone can just meet, you

89
00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.470
know, telepresence is great. You
can actually have like high

90
00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.290
quality HD video. You can
make this like face to

91
00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.040
face connection. I've built entire
remote teams using telepresence technology.

92
00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.020
And you know, you can
just get really comfortable there

93
00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.010
again. Great. But none of,
neither of those were actually

94
00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.800
made for this type of
interactive brainstorming kind of thing.

95
00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.010
Right. Right. I mean, I
work remotely as I think

96
00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.380
some of the listeners know
I live in Portland, I've

97
00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.660
always tried to solve the
remote worker problem with more

98
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.170
bandwidth and a higher definition
camera, but it breaks down

99
00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:09.480
as soon as I say,
just look over my shoulder.

100
00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.540
Oh yeah. Or let me
put this Use of paper.

101
00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.670
I'm going to draw this
for you. Let me draw

102
00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:16.140
this and let me show
it to you. The camera

103
00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.930
I have literally, They held
sheets of paper up to

104
00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.280
the camera and then they
have to wait for the

105
00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.730
camera to focus. And he's
like, Oh yeah, destroys. It

106
00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:26.370
does it completely does. And
that's kind of ridiculous that

107
00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.830
that has to destroy the
flow. Like that's such a

108
00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.860
just normal thing that we
do every day and, you

109
00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.710
know, technology should be able
to do that. So what

110
00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.410
we did was we, you
know, again, like I've really

111
00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.990
been pushing, taking this experience
first approach. I mean, I'm

112
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.090
a technologist and I, I
could just total away at

113
00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.030
technology all day long, but
then I realized you need

114
00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.550
to think about the experience
first. So we took our

115
00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.190
designer and we have this
kind of awesome designer. We

116
00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:52.560
said, let's think about this
problem. So we started with

117
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.530
the problem statement, just thinking
about what people wanted to

118
00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:58.400
do and try to design
a solution. And then what

119
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.530
we came up with was,
and I know this is

120
00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:02.870
kind of big, but we
were just saying, don't constrain

121
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.720
yourself. Just think about what
people are doing. So we

122
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.120
actually have these kind of
10 touch screens, like kind

123
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.010
of two layers. Like it's
like a two by five.

124
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:13.040
You know, two of them
are in one wall. Two

125
00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.840
of them are on the
other wall at 90 degrees.

126
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:15.770
And two of them are
kind of like at a

127
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.690
45 degree angle there. So
you kind of like get,

128
00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:20.690
you know, get across of
this kind of L-shaped room

129
00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.260
with these 10 screens on
one side of the wall

130
00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.020
is just full what we
call head to toe telepresence

131
00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.020
video. So it's not head
and shoulders. Like when you

132
00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:31.970
do video conferencing today, you
often do like head and

133
00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:34.850
shoulders video, but instead what
we did, and then you

134
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:37.520
sit there, you're kind of
like a discombobulated. Your head's

135
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.380
just kind of popped off.
And you're like floating with

136
00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.600
this head and shoulders image
and you like see others.

137
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.030
But instead what we said
was it helps to see

138
00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:46.070
the whole room, you know?
So we want like kind

139
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:48.350
of head to toe. Like
if people are like kind

140
00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:49.820
of huddled next to each
other, we want to see

141
00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:51.860
that if they're kind of
back, people are kind of

142
00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.010
leaning back and, you know,
shrugging or just actively engaged.

143
00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:56.390
You just want to see
all that. It just helps

144
00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:58.370
you understand what's going on
in the room. It's hard

145
00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:00.880
when you're remote to know
what's going on. We always

146
00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.550
talk about those funny phones.
We call them the cling

147
00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:05.590
on phone, you know, the
little Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

148
00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:09.250
So when you're on the
cling on the phone, Hey

149
00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:12.640
guys, I have a question.
I can't see their faces.

150
00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:15.160
I don't know if they
could be rolling their eyes

151
00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.490
at me. They are like,
thank you. I can't see

152
00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:20.080
if they are or what
their posture is. I don't

153
00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.480
even know if they have
on pants. It's crazy. It

154
00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:26.080
is that I saw immediately.
Where's the team that is

155
00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:27.850
remote on the other side
of that screen. Where are

156
00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:30.580
they? We actually have two
of them. One's in Shanghai.

157
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:33.310
And then the other is
in San Jose right here.

158
00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:36.010
We have the room, you
know, temporarily here in Moscone,

159
00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:37.720
you know, at Cisco live
here in the dev net

160
00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:42.160
zone. But yeah. Yeah. And
you, it, it feels like

161
00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.080
they're behind it. Like, you
know what I'm saying? It

162
00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.660
is, it does just to
propose for folks that are

163
00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:49.930
listening this idea of, of
the, the field of view,

164
00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:53.320
I think we're used to
very inexpensive go to best

165
00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:56.680
buy and buy a hundred
dollar webcam. This is multiple

166
00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:00.520
cameras working in concert with
each other, being stitched together,

167
00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:04.390
very thoughtfully. And the quality
is really exceptional. Yeah. You

168
00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:06.580
can imagine, like you have
like a three by two

169
00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:09.400
set of screens. Like you
have like six HDTV screens

170
00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:11.620
kind of like set up
there. And then what you

171
00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:13.930
just see is the other
room. I mean, there's other

172
00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:15.520
technologies, but you just see
the other room and you

173
00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.830
just see the other people.
You're not thinking about the

174
00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:21.300
technology. You're just thinking about
the people. Right. And so,

175
00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:23.230
so that's kind of like
on one side of it.

176
00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:25.750
So you get the full
head to toe telepresence video.

177
00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:29.320
Now on the other screen,
what you see is basically

178
00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.180
the content like then you
get to work and you

179
00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:33.190
start working and what do
you wanna do? You wanna

180
00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:35.620
do things like share documents,
but not only do you

181
00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:37.960
want to share documents and
presentations, you kind of want

182
00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:39.760
to write on it and
annotate and say, Oh, look

183
00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:41.950
over here like this thing.
And then you start start

184
00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:44.590
drawing. So you can do
that. You want to take

185
00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:46.240
your presentation, you want to
make it full screen, or

186
00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.160
you want to make it
half screen. You want to

187
00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.530
just kind of use touch
gestures to like flip the

188
00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:53.140
pages. You actually want to
go and start like just

189
00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.970
using a whiteboard and sketching.
And when I write something,

190
00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:59.130
you want to write something,
you should be able to

191
00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:01.170
erase what I drew. I
should be able to erase

192
00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:02.460
what you just like, what
you do in a normal

193
00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:05.040
whiteboard, you know, and what
we actually call that is

194
00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.110
like, when you're two people
are working at a whiteboard,

195
00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:10.020
you kind of look at
each other, you look at

196
00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:11.640
the board, you look at
each other, you look at

197
00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.980
the board, we actually call
that shoulder to shoulder collaboration.

198
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:17.250
And it's kind of interesting
because you're shoulder to shoulder,

199
00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.350
sometimes you just kind of
tilt and look at the

200
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:21.510
board, you tilt your head,
you're looking at each other.

201
00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:24.480
And what we wanted to
do was actually tank kind

202
00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.570
of take that principle and
just like throw it across

203
00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:31.050
the ocean. Right. So what
happens is on the left

204
00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:33.570
wall is this whole content
collaboration board. You can look

205
00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:35.730
at it and then you
turn your head to the

206
00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:37.530
right a little bit. And
then on the wall, you

207
00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:40.350
see your collaborator, who's across
the ocean, but you're shoulder

208
00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:42.270
to shoulder with them. And
that's why we did that

209
00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:46.500
kind of L-shape room. And
it's really cool because you

210
00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:49.650
literally just start working shoulder
to shoulder. You know, you

211
00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:51.780
know me in San Jose
with my team members in

212
00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:54.300
Shanghai and then boom, you
know, you're just going, you

213
00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:57.440
just forget that you're not
in the same place Now.

214
00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:59.150
I just want to make
it like, I want, I

215
00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:02.150
want this myself. You know
what I mean? Like it's

216
00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:04.550
interesting that you point out
that, that the shape matters.

217
00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:08.000
I spend a lot of
time working on remote work

218
00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:10.730
issues and trying to fix
it again from the, from,

219
00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.370
from the experience perspective of
me, right. You're trying to

220
00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:15.710
solve the problem for general
teams doing shoulder to shoulder

221
00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:19.100
for me as the center
of my universe. Absolutely. My

222
00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:23.180
problem. And I solve my
problems too. Of course. So

223
00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:26.180
originally I set up my
camera to look at me

224
00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:28.220
and I said, Oh, well,
I've got enough bandwidth. I'll

225
00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:31.160
just have a Skype call
running all the time. And

226
00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.350
then I found that and
I set up a room

227
00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.480
in Seattle and people would
come in and they would

228
00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:38.810
see my, basically my face
or up my nose. And

229
00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:42.110
I'm staring into I'm staring
into space and that made

230
00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:44.600
people uncomfortable. And my head
was the wrong size. It

231
00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:47.840
would be like a giant
42 inch head. So I

232
00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.600
started to realize that the
size of the other person

233
00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:54.050
and their orientation mattered. So
while I haven't, I didn't

234
00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:55.880
have the idea that you
have the, the L shape

235
00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:59.840
by moving the camera to
one side. It does give

236
00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:04.280
you that, Oh, hello. I
didn't see you there turn.

237
00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:06.290
So when someone comes in,
they're not looking up your

238
00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:09.290
nose of your face, they're
seeing your side. And then

239
00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:12.740
we oriented it, such that
if I had a body,

240
00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:15.710
it would be facing this
direction in my office and

241
00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:17.660
someone would peek in and
go, Hey, are you busy?

242
00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:19.700
And I would turn my
head and go, no, come

243
00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:22.820
on in. Awesome. That's cool.
I love that idea of,

244
00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:26.240
wow. There's a meaning for
that. L-shape Yeah, there's definitely

245
00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.040
an idea about it. And
I did it like, you

246
00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:29.750
know, my husband who is
also a geek, so we

247
00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:32.570
were like working in our
separate offices and then we

248
00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:34.340
just, just tried it for
a little while to both

249
00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:37.880
turn on our website. Well,
we do do that, but

250
00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:40.820
in this case we actually
do. But in this case,

251
00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:43.130
we were in different offices,
not that far away from

252
00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:45.590
each other, but, but what
we are doing is we

253
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:47.570
actually just kind of for
a little while, just both

254
00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:49.670
turned on our webcams. Right.
And so then we're sitting

255
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:51.800
there, we both had our
webcams on at the time.

256
00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:54.940
And then I just tried
to like, leave it on

257
00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:58.570
to just have that ambient
kind of, you know, kind

258
00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:00.430
of awareness. Like you're kind
of next to each other,

259
00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:02.650
but it was a little
bit freaky because it's the

260
00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:05.110
webcam in front of him.
And then when he was

261
00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:08.740
working on some documents and
then, you know, his window

262
00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:11.650
covered up the video of
me, then maybe he forgot

263
00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:14.560
I was looking at him,
but then he's kind of

264
00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:16.690
looking like right below me,
because he's looking at his

265
00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:19.600
laptop and the webcam's right
there, but he didn't know

266
00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.220
what I was there. So
it was kind of nice,

267
00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:22.570
but it was, I also
felt like I was spying

268
00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:25.330
on him. Indeed know, I
didn't want, so once you

269
00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:27.550
take it off the screen
though, and then you have

270
00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:29.770
like the video in another
place, like where the person

271
00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:31.390
would be can look at
your screen, you look at

272
00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:34.930
the person, it gets to
be this more natural, more

273
00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:37.650
natural interaction. Yeah, it definitely.
Yeah. And given that screens

274
00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:41.460
are so inexpensive right now,
you know, if, if a

275
00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:44.190
sense of telepresence and collaboration
is important to you simply

276
00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:48.210
adding another screen is a
very nice, easily priced way

277
00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:50.310
for someone like me to
put together a poor man's.

278
00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:54.780
Yeah, definitely. Definitely Software that
you've got here is bringing

279
00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:56.760
together a lot of different
things though. It's not just,

280
00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:58.710
Hey, we've got a whole
bunch of screens and we

281
00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:00.390
stack them on top of
each other. You've got the

282
00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:03.450
collaboration and it seems like
it's kind of shocking. Cause

283
00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:06.940
I remember doing real basic
video conferencing in the mid

284
00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:11.310
nineties, maybe absolutely something entails
something share. I forgot what

285
00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:14.550
it was called. Very tiny,
you know, three 20 by

286
00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:18.950
two 40 Like CUSIP video
and like SIF. Yeah, exactly.

287
00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.210
It was just horrific. I
mean, yeah. It was like

288
00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:23.700
watching an animated GIF of
other people. I was working

289
00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:26.700
on video back then as
well, like a game boy

290
00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:29.550
camera. It was like, I
was like that. We're so

291
00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:32.130
excited that like, Hey look
at those pixels, we got

292
00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:34.890
a few pixels across, it
looks like a person. It

293
00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:39.360
does Fast forward 20, 25
years. And I still don't

294
00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:44.360
have a decent shared surface
for collaboration. You know, you

295
00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:48.090
know, collaboration products, whether it
be WebEx from, in Cisco

296
00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:51.450
or a product like link,
they still involve this gesture,

297
00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:55.530
which is the no comes
the whiteboard. Yes. And it

298
00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:58.680
doesn't look like anything. It's
like a poor man's paintbrush.

299
00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:02.400
Yeah. I want to collaborate
on a document on a

300
00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:05.760
presentation on a whole new
series of ideas with natural

301
00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:08.940
gestures or within my, my
fingers or pen. It's interesting

302
00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:13.950
because what happens is I'm
like, there's actually like everything

303
00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:16.020
that you just didn't you
and I just talked about,

304
00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:18.300
actually it's all out there.
You could say, Oh, well

305
00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:20.040
you could use this for
that. You could use that

306
00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:21.930
for that. You know, you
kind of add up together,

307
00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:24.090
I'll use the Google Hangouts
for this. I'll use kind

308
00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:26.220
of Evernote for that. And
I'll use, you have all

309
00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:30.540
of these pieces in each
piece. Like some of them

310
00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:33.060
were great, but the problem
is you don't have that

311
00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:35.220
holistic experience. Right. So you're
like, Oh wait, let me

312
00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:36.930
switch an app and go
over here to do that.

313
00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:38.580
And then I'll like put
up my webcam and I

314
00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:41.790
can do my video, you
know? But it's like, it's

315
00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:44.130
kind of hard. Right. And
then basically kind of hard.

316
00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:46.440
I mean, it's kind of
impossible, 15 minutes at the

317
00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:48.660
beginning of every meeting and
these are technical people that

318
00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:51.410
might be messing around. Can
we, can you share your

319
00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:53.420
screen? Can you see it
now? Okay. My camera's not

320
00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:55.040
on, can you hear me
now? Can you hear me

321
00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:57.350
now? It doesn't feel like
that, that the fit first

322
00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:58.940
15 minutes of every meeting
or just getting the meeting

323
00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:01.690
set up. Well, we've actually
been working on that. So

324
00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:04.130
we're actually do a little
bit better than that, but

325
00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:05.800
it kind of depends. Yeah.
Cause we like have it

326
00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:07.060
where you can actually just
kind of set up your

327
00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:09.280
telepresence. You just dial in,
you kind of get your

328
00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:11.260
WebEx connected. We probably have
it down to about five

329
00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:14.800
minutes. But, but, but, but
you're right. But in general

330
00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.320
it is kind of like
a mess and there's like

331
00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:20.020
all sorts of stuff there.
And then kind of what

332
00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:22.390
I call those experiences, like
where you're using these different

333
00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:25.330
tools that are like mr.
Potato head experiences. Right? Cause

334
00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:27.640
it's like, you're like, well,
here's a nose, there's my

335
00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:29.470
video. And then here's this
other tool that I could

336
00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:33.160
use to like share my
presentation and what happens is

337
00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:35.380
even if each tool is
awesome, when you put them

338
00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:38.140
all together, you still get
Frankenstein or mr. Potato head,

339
00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:40.420
you have like all these
pieces kind of put together.

340
00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:44.800
And so really what we're
going for is the designed

341
00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:48.400
experience, right? So you have
some video there, you have

342
00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:50.800
some content here, you can
switch between them. And you

343
00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:53.470
want to think about the
whole workflow and not just

344
00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:56.050
the one thing you definitely
want to integrate third party

345
00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:58.360
tools. Like it's not that
we have to build everything

346
00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:01.780
ourselves, but you want to
think about that holistic experience

347
00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:03.340
and how they come together.
So you don't have a

348
00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:05.890
mr. Potato head experienced when
you have a mr. Potato.

349
00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:07.930
Like you've been in those
rooms where you go to

350
00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:10.480
a room and there's some,
you know, like, there's your,

351
00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:13.120
your cling on phones, that
what you call it, you're

352
00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:16.060
calling on phone in there.
There's like a projector, right?

353
00:16:16.210 --> 00:16:19.570
There's like some kind of
a smart board. And then

354
00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:21.610
you like walk into the
room and then there's like

355
00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:24.160
two VGA connections, you know?
Like I want to project

356
00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:26.560
my laptop and there's these
two VGA connections. How does

357
00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:29.110
it work? And then there's
like two remotes. And then

358
00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:30.550
you sit there and you
like plug it into your

359
00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:35.050
laptop, Come to our offices
at Microsoft. Yes, that's exactly

360
00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:37.540
right. We actually have a
connector that comes out now

361
00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:40.690
with a key ring of
other connectors so that you

362
00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:42.250
can figure out how to,
and then you can, They

363
00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:43.930
never worked. They never, until
the thing is these rooms

364
00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:45.940
never work. Like, cause then
you like try one and

365
00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:47.530
then you try the other
and then you like grab

366
00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:50.590
the thing. And then you're
a, you know, with, you

367
00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:52.540
know, you don't know which
remote's working and then you

368
00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:54.190
stand up on the table,
they hit the projector with

369
00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:56.260
your fingers. Inevitably, I may
be able to get the

370
00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.780
projection up for the local
people, but then it's like,

371
00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:01.330
well, can you guys see
it on the remote? It's

372
00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:04.210
not integrated. Yeah. What was
amazing about yours was that

373
00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:05.920
there wasn't ever a sense
of, I was in an

374
00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:10.600
app. Yeah. If I may.
Yeah. There was a, when

375
00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:12.430
I got there and I
stepped into it, it was

376
00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:15.760
just all people. And then
the gentlemen just swiped his

377
00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:17.740
hand and I thought there
was like a connect hidden

378
00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:20.230
somewhere. But he, it, it,
he swiped his hand and

379
00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:23.830
then four of the TVs
switch to show a PowerPoint

380
00:17:23.830 --> 00:17:27.490
presentation. Yeah. But I didn't
see PowerPoint. No, you know

381
00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:29.560
what I'm saying? There was
no Chrome. And it was

382
00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:32.920
very comforting. The reason we
had to do that is

383
00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:35.110
like we were thinking about,
well, we want to show

384
00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:38.080
PowerPoint and PowerPoint's great. It's
the best way to make

385
00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:40.630
slides. You know, you can
kind of share those, but

386
00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:43.270
if we take this kind
of, you know, big screen

387
00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:47.320
touch interface system, and then
you throw up like windows,

388
00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:49.980
PowerPoint, which has made for
a keyboard and a mouse,

389
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:52.380
then you're trying to use
your finger to click on

390
00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:54.900
the menus, which are not
made for your finger. And

391
00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:57.090
then you're just like, Oh,
I feel like my fingers

392
00:17:57.090 --> 00:17:59.910
really fat, you know, it's
good and you can't control

393
00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:02.160
it. So we actually had
to make our own viewers

394
00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:05.010
and really, and just simplify,
we just simplified out just

395
00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:08.220
like, all right, we're not
allowing, you know, certain kind

396
00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:09.810
of fancy things here. We
just want to do next

397
00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:14.010
slide. Previous slide, go full
screen, go smaller and just

398
00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:16.830
do like two fingers up,
two fingers down, pinch zoom,

399
00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:19.080
you know? So just try
to make it very natural.

400
00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:22.200
And there's all sorts of
actually really advanced technologies that

401
00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:24.870
we're testing and putting in
the system. Like you could

402
00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:27.060
just, it's like technology to
light. Right? You could put

403
00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:30.210
everything in there. But what
we had had to do

404
00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:33.330
is really do the experience
simplification because the thing that

405
00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:35.760
we cared about is whether
people could use it. Right.

406
00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:37.530
So we actually wanted to
get down to like maybe

407
00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:40.440
10 gestures or less than
probably fewer than that. We

408
00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:42.300
actually want to just something
where people could kind of

409
00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:44.520
watch someone do it and
then be able to use

410
00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:47.820
it themselves. We didn't want
people to feel dumb. You

411
00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:49.350
know? Like you just kind
of feel dumb when you're

412
00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:51.900
trying to use the technology.
But you think about it.

413
00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:54.630
You're collaborating when you're presenting
and you want to work

414
00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:56.640
together. You don't want to
feel dumb, right? You want

415
00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:59.250
to present, you want to
feel smart. You know, you

416
00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:01.470
can't have the tools hold
you down. So that was

417
00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:03.840
kind of, those were like
some of the design principles

418
00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:06.540
that we were using is
just want to make it

419
00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:08.910
so simple and think of
the user first. And then

420
00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:11.250
just like simplify. We used
to have voice commands in

421
00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:14.250
there and we're sitting there
and say, okay, next slide.

422
00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:16.710
And then boom, the slide
changes, make it bigger. And

423
00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:19.320
then it would go full
screen. And that was all

424
00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:21.810
great. But then every so
often I'd be just talking

425
00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:24.480
to somebody and then the
slides would change. And, and

426
00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:26.760
then, you know, John Chambers was
actually coming in for a

427
00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:29.280
demo and then we're like,
okay, we're going to take

428
00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:31.080
that feature out. Cause we
don't want the slides changing

429
00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:34.170
as John comes by. So,
so, so like there's a

430
00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:36.990
whole bunch of extra things
we tried, but we took

431
00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:39.450
some of them out cause
they weren't reliable. But like

432
00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:40.860
one cool thing that is
good as we take the

433
00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:43.470
video, we turn it off.
We actually do. Or we,

434
00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:46.470
sorry, you know, kind of
fork it off. We're actually

435
00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:50.040
doing video analysis. We like
find, identify faces. And then

436
00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:52.770
we put people's names above
their heads. So a small

437
00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:56.810
thing, but it's so useful.
Right? People, People I've worked

438
00:19:56.810 --> 00:19:59.270
at Microsoft now like six
years and I go up

439
00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:01.910
and visit and people, Hey,
it's great to see you.

440
00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:05.000
And like, I don't know
who you are. I know

441
00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:08.630
we've worked together for five
years and you no longer

442
00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:11.900
look like the picture on
your badge that shows up

443
00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:14.390
in outlook, you've worked at
the company 20 years. You

444
00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:16.230
don't like to see it.
Exactly. So, and then I

445
00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:20.840
like, Hey buddy, who is
that? That's John. You've worked

446
00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:22.880
with them for the last
50 hours. Like I know

447
00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:25.880
them from an email alias
and from an old picture.

448
00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:27.620
And then when I see
them in person or on

449
00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:29.660
video, I have no idea
To be honest, it's hard

450
00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:31.670
for me. Cause like I'm
a woman, you know, there's

451
00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:33.410
not many women in tech.
So it's kind of easy

452
00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:36.170
for people to remember me,
but I can't remember everybody

453
00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:39.170
either. So we added like
kind of just the face

454
00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:41.180
recognition. Right? And then it
just gives you a little

455
00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:43.460
hint. Maybe it doesn't know
someone's name. It leaves it

456
00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:45.290
blank. But if it does
find someone, it just puts

457
00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:47.380
their name over their heads.
Brilliant. Let's just, it makes

458
00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:49.150
me feel better to The,
to the point about the

459
00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:52.300
voice recognition. There's a funny
story about the Xbox one,

460
00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:54.850
which you can tell, turn
on and off someone changed

461
00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:59.650
their gamer tag to X-Box
turn off. So then he

462
00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:01.630
goes, this is true story.
This actually happened. You can

463
00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:03.490
watch the video. So he
goes in and he starts

464
00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:05.200
shooting people in call of
duty and I'm like, Oh,

465
00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:10.900
Xbox, turn off. Don't turn
off. That's awesome. It's a

466
00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:13.660
great Frank it's one way
to win, shut shutting machines

467
00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:16.090
down left and right. Cool.
That makes sense though, because

468
00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:17.200
I want to go into
a room. I want to

469
00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:20.110
collaborate with a whiteboard. I
shouldn't have to talk to

470
00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:23.410
the white board. Yes. That
makes sense. That the fact

471
00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:27.400
that we're talking about users,
dinner design in a way

472
00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:31.330
that somehow like, that's amazing.
Why should it be amazing?

473
00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:35.250
Why am I so amazed
that that's the case? That's

474
00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:37.920
plenty. Yeah, no, no, no.
It's, it's funny because, because

475
00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:40.470
it's still rare. Like, so
we can still say like,

476
00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:43.140
listen, and I've been pushing
this kind of for the

477
00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:45.870
last 10 years now is
just you, you know, again,

478
00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:50.160
I'm like techie geek. So
started like video video compression,

479
00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:52.860
video transcoding and video over
networks, you know? So looking

480
00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:55.980
at martini yesterday, I mean
you were employed in the

481
00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:59.610
JPEG 2000 spec, is that
correct? I helped add security

482
00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:02.190
to JPEG 2000. Even before
that in the, in the

483
00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:04.830
early nineties I was studying
at MIT, but I was

484
00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:07.620
doing my, my work on
HDTV. So we're actually defining

485
00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:11.190
the HDTV technologies, which are
now commonplace, but certainly were

486
00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:14.910
not in the early nineties.
So you have been kind

487
00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:17.520
of working on that stuff
for a long time. You

488
00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:20.460
know, I was like convincing
myself, you know, cause like

489
00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:24.360
video over networks was my
field video streaming. I was

490
00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:26.790
like, yeah, let's do some
video conferencing. It works. And

491
00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:28.950
then you get this little
like posted stamp size video.

492
00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:31.650
Cause it's like QCF resolution,
you know? And then you

493
00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:33.870
like, you know, you have
this little version of your

494
00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:36.030
head, you like slide over,
you got the blocking artifacts,

495
00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:38.580
your nose stays there while
your head moves. And then

496
00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:41.010
we're just like, this is
great. We're video conferencing. Well

497
00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:43.680
kind of, you know, but
then, you know, so I

498
00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:45.810
was at HP at the
time and Cisco is doing

499
00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:49.020
telepresence, but HP did HP
halo working together with Dreamworks.

500
00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:52.080
And what we did was
we actually thought let's revisit

501
00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:55.380
all of those assumptions. Like
yeah. Why do you have

502
00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:58.290
to use low bandwidth? Like
just assume that we can

503
00:22:58.290 --> 00:23:00.660
go to higher bandwidth cause
that's going to come, right.

504
00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:03.660
Let's use bigger screens. Let's
not constrain ourselves with costs

505
00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:06.000
at this moment, but we'll
go back to that later.

506
00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:09.570
And then we came up
with what is now, what

507
00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:11.970
was HP halo, which was,
you know, kind of the

508
00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:15.150
immersive telepresence and Cisco did
immersive telepresence, you know, kind

509
00:23:15.150 --> 00:23:17.490
of in parallel at the
same time. And then all

510
00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:20.490
of a sudden you're having
HD video, right? So you're

511
00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:25.650
giving like HDTV quality video,
you know, larger screens. And

512
00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:29.910
then you're like, wow, this
is video conferencing. That other

513
00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:32.640
stuff we were pretending was
video conferencing. But now this

514
00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:34.320
is, and so it was
just because what we did

515
00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:37.590
was we put the experience
first and then develop the

516
00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:41.130
technology around it. And then
video conferencing was not just

517
00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:45.770
video conferencing. It really turned
into video conferencing. And so

518
00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:49.310
at that point I made
the realization that experience matters.

519
00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:52.250
So I could still twiddle
away with, you know, bits

520
00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:56.060
and compression and streaming and
networking all the time. But

521
00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:59.150
if you think experience first,
it actually gets harder. Cause

522
00:23:59.150 --> 00:24:01.880
you think what's the experience
I want to give. I

523
00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:04.100
want to simplify it. And
then you have to do

524
00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:07.850
all of the technology acrobatics
to make that simple experience

525
00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:11.380
and it's Yeah. And it's
definitely harder than just specs.

526
00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:14.230
Like I, I went and
I got my a hundred

527
00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:16.840
dollar webcam and I at
my I seven processor and

528
00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:18.610
I said, look at that
and I've got 10 ADP

529
00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:22.270
looks great. It couldn't be
any better than this. And

530
00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:25.300
then when the Cisco Boomi
happened, I immediately bought two

531
00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:29.050
Zumiez. And I said, Oh,
that's what Trinity P looks

532
00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:33.340
like. I had been using
kind of muddy, a tiny,

533
00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:36.130
tiny little seamless sensor, you
know, kind of, it was

534
00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:38.740
muddied Trinity P at about
10 or 15 frames a

535
00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:41.080
second. And then when I
went to the army, it

536
00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:43.150
was like either 30 or
60 frames, a second. There's

537
00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:45.190
like a streaming blue Ray.
You know what I mean?

538
00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:48.670
It was like, here I
am looking at two streams

539
00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:52.030
of 10 ADP and I
can't, it's like, you know,

540
00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:54.130
getting a new contact lenses.
It's just like, I can't

541
00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:58.120
even look at this anymore.
Like suddenly 10 80 P

542
00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:03.580
video on my cheap webcam
offends me. I must like,

543
00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:06.910
this is now the standard
by which all video It

544
00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:09.610
is, it goes up. But
then you probably started to

545
00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:12.580
get value out of it.
Yeah. Because I could see

546
00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:16.870
expressions. I could see the
fluidity, the difference between 10

547
00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:19.630
or 15 frames a second
in 30 or 60 when

548
00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:21.760
it comes to movement. It's
just unbelievable. It was as

549
00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:23.830
if they were sitting there.
Yeah. Yeah. You just get

550
00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:26.380
over that. You just get
kind of over that threshold

551
00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:29.380
to where it's like, yes,
like now I know you,

552
00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:32.080
right. Especially if you're working
remotely and it's hard for

553
00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:34.930
me to do like just
audio, you know? But when

554
00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:38.560
you see somebody then you
know them, The, the idea

555
00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:42.280
that it has to be
audio or that, and as

556
00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:43.930
a remote worker, if I
can get video out of

557
00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:46.120
someone, that's a joy. When
I, when I was in

558
00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:48.190
Seattle a couple of days
ago, someone said, Oh, I'd

559
00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:49.510
love to meet when he,
how long you need to

560
00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:50.890
be up here. And I
said, Oh, I'm going back

561
00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:53.470
home today. Oh, well give
me a call next time.

562
00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:57.760
You're up next time. I'm
up. I'm on link on

563
00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:01.570
10 80 P video all
day long. Every day I

564
00:26:01.570 --> 00:26:03.880
am available on conference calls.
I can talk to you

565
00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:06.070
on an eight, whatever I'm
no, no, no. Just call

566
00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:10.480
me when you're up. Well,
wait a second. I appreciate

567
00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:12.280
that. You want to see
me in person, but what

568
00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:15.520
is missing in my experience?
Like what is so not

569
00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:17.950
satisfying about the experience that
you, you don't even want

570
00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:21.160
to try to Skype me.
Yeah. Yeah. Clearly it's not

571
00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:23.440
working. Cause that, that, that,
that idea of will call

572
00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:26.080
me next time you're in.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Means

573
00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:28.720
that the solution I have
doesn't work. That's right. That's

574
00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:30.310
right. Well, and I think
what we want to do

575
00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:32.020
is so, so now you
get to the stage where

576
00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:34.450
like, okay, video is better,
right. Video is good. You

577
00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:36.580
can actually create that. And
then what we're trying to

578
00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:39.460
do next with this augmented
collaboration is to say, well,

579
00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:41.740
the next thing, like, think
when you get to know

580
00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:44.670
somebody and then when you
like, you've like really work

581
00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:47.400
together and know each other,
but if you've whiteboard it

582
00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:49.440
together, right. You just kind
of thought of an idea.

583
00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:51.300
You went up to the
whiteboard, you guys kind of

584
00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:54.090
work through something, then you
really feel like, you know,

585
00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:56.730
the person going through battles.
Yeah, exactly. It's a shared

586
00:26:56.730 --> 00:26:59.040
experience. Then you're gonna remember
their name right at that

587
00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:01.040
stage. Well, and that's why
we have Of off sites.

588
00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:03.350
And we've all gone to
those kinds of corporate training

589
00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:05.270
things where they bring some
third party in with a

590
00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:07.910
whiteboard. And then you do
your, you have that experience,

591
00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:10.910
that shoulder to shoulder experience.
Yeah. And then you know

592
00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:13.790
that it's not just like
you had a formal presentation

593
00:27:13.790 --> 00:27:15.530
and then you listened and
you ask them did some

594
00:27:15.530 --> 00:27:18.470
Q and a, but you've
created something together, you know?

595
00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:20.690
And so those ideas that
like, after you get to

596
00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:23.480
that part of our relationship
where you've kind of co-created

597
00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:25.820
bounce some ideas, well, well,
let me try to draw

598
00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:27.680
this. Right. You kind of
get to that stage where

599
00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:29.630
people are writing on the
board. That gets really interesting.

600
00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:33.260
So people can, can people
see a video of this

601
00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:35.480
somewhere? Like I know I'm
seeing a link, I'll give

602
00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:37.250
you a link to a
video. Okay. We'll put that

603
00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:38.750
in the show notes to
make sure that people can

604
00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:40.880
learn more about this. Yeah,
it sounds great. And this

605
00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:43.700
is just an idea right
now it's being breached. No,

606
00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:45.890
it's just an idea. So
it's an innovation, it's an

607
00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:48.680
idea. We've kind of put
it to prototype. We don't

608
00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:51.530
have a decision to productize
it, but we're trying to

609
00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:53.450
do is kind of get
user feedback. Right. So we

610
00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:55.880
actually want to show the
innovation. Like we're still using

611
00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:58.790
kind of agile development and
we're adding new features, but

612
00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:01.610
you know, it's one thing
that like my team and

613
00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:03.890
I, we created it and
we can use it between

614
00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:06.320
us. And of course we
love it, but we created

615
00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:08.450
it. So that's not really
a fair kind of judge

616
00:28:08.450 --> 00:28:10.820
of it, you know, it
demos quite well. And so

617
00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:13.130
when we demo it, then
like people get of course,

618
00:28:13.130 --> 00:28:15.770
very excited. What we understand
is how do people use

619
00:28:15.770 --> 00:28:17.660
it, you know? And will
people use it and how

620
00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:19.010
does that go? So we're
going to do is like

621
00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:21.740
try to study that some
more and then try to

622
00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:24.170
get more feedback. And, you
know, maybe the whole thing

623
00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:26.930
becomes a product. Maybe it
doesn't, or maybe elements of

624
00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:29.000
it become a problem, you
know? So it's just kind

625
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.610
of like going through that
next stage of innovation and

626
00:28:31.790 --> 00:28:33.560
kind of that's what, Or
working on it and you're

627
00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:35.810
using it like your, your,
you spend time in this

628
00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:39.470
thing and you use it
to build itself. Yeah. And

629
00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:42.140
actually I have a video
of like using spring roll

630
00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:45.980
to, to make spring roll.
Right. So basically we were

631
00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:48.860
actually kind of spring rolls
our code name for it.

632
00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:51.710
So basically the project was
first approved in the spring

633
00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:54.260
and we use kind of
rolling iterations and agile and

634
00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:56.300
it's a little Asian and
you know, much of my

635
00:28:56.300 --> 00:29:00.080
innovation teams in Shanghai. So
my family's from Korea, like

636
00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:02.420
I'm American, but my team
happens to be in Shanghai

637
00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:04.760
and they've been working really
hard on it, but they

638
00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:08.690
just kind of code named
it spring roll. But, but

639
00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:11.060
yeah, like we just kind
of get in there. We

640
00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:13.910
have our meetings in there,
we use it. It's really

641
00:29:13.910 --> 00:29:16.670
nice and interactive. And then,
you know, we figure out

642
00:29:16.670 --> 00:29:18.770
how can we improve it?
And the best thing is

643
00:29:18.770 --> 00:29:20.660
when you're meeting, then you
kind of get more ideas

644
00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:23.030
on what needs to be
in there. Next it's the

645
00:29:23.030 --> 00:29:24.290
best idea. So what we
want to do is now

646
00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:26.120
get other people in there
using it to get their

647
00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:28.160
feedback. Well, do you think
that there could be more

648
00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:30.500
than two, then you could
have three or four and

649
00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:32.600
split things up and have,
It can be in there's

650
00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:34.670
actually even more than that.
So what we've done actually,

651
00:29:34.670 --> 00:29:37.460
since, you know, the, the
initial build, like, you know,

652
00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:39.380
when you first build it,
you want to get something

653
00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:41.800
going as quick as possible,
do the, to get it

654
00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:44.530
going. And what we've actually
done now is we've actually,

655
00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:46.390
and we kind of built
it for two rooms to

656
00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:48.640
work together, but now we
actually did a number of

657
00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:50.470
things. We've actually shifted it
to more of a cloud

658
00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:53.110
based architecture. So you can
actually do things like white

659
00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:55.690
boarding document sharing. We actually
have sticky notes, which we

660
00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:57.640
didn't talk about here. We
have all these features and

661
00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:00.580
those are just each cloud
services. And then an end

662
00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:03.220
point could be, you know,
one of those big rooms,

663
00:30:03.490 --> 00:30:05.650
but you could also, we
also have an iPad client.

664
00:30:05.650 --> 00:30:08.050
So you could actually also
do your interactions through an

665
00:30:08.050 --> 00:30:11.920
iPad. Client can actually just
call into any video. And

666
00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:14.110
so we've actually kind of
scaled it out, you know,

667
00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:17.680
over the collaboration kind of
strategy for Cisco is to

668
00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:20.590
kind of let people collaborate
from the browser to the

669
00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:22.750
boardroom, you know, so you'd
kind of have like the

670
00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:24.850
higher end stuff, but all
the way down to making

671
00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:27.670
it mobile and pervasive. So
we're actually kind of playing

672
00:30:27.670 --> 00:30:30.730
with all of these different
kind of form factors in

673
00:30:30.730 --> 00:30:32.950
situations as well. Cause you
still want to get like

674
00:30:33.370 --> 00:30:35.780
the guy in an airport,
you know, the person at

675
00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:38.500
a convention still trying to
dial into their meeting. So

676
00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:40.240
we're still trying to make
all that happen as well.

677
00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:42.850
Yeah. Very cool. Thank you
so much, Susie wee for

678
00:30:42.850 --> 00:30:46.060
checking with me today here
at DevNet at Cisco alive.

679
00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:48.190
This has been another episode
of Hansel minutes and we'll

680
00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:56.280
see you again next week.
