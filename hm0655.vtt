Hey folks, Intel is a
sponsor this week and I

2
00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.450
welcome them because they're bringing
some high performance developer tools

3
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.350
for all of us. Check
out Intel's parallel studio X,

4
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.470
E I've talked about parallelism
before on the show and

5
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.070
the importance of using the
complete instruction set, unlocking the

6
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.140
power of the process or
that your code is running

7
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.870
on. Now, you all might
be writing C or C

8
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.350
plus plus Python or even
Fortran, but as your code

9
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.360
building in such a way
and written in such a

10
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.220
way that it uses the
latest techniques for vectorization multithreading

11
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.860
multi-node parallelization or memory optimization.

E. Hi, this is Scott
Hanselman. This is another episode

19
00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.830
Hansel minutes today. I'm talking
with John Alexander. He's a gamer

20
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.230
and a content developer, and
we're talking to him about

21
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.620
the Xbox adaptive controller. How
are you, sir? Wonderful, sir.

22
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.330
Thanks for taking the time
to talk to me about

23
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.390
this. Yeah, so this is
out now. I can go

24
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.410
and buy the Xbox adaptive
controller for, for 99 bucks

25
00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.320
or a hundred bucks, U
S a in stores or

26
00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.580
Microsoft stores. Yes, somehow I
thought it would be more

27
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.010
expensive. Like I thought it
would be like a thing.

28
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.260
Like it would be hundreds
of dollars. It would be

29
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.170
X-Box priced, but that seems
like a very reasonable price

30
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.120
for something that's gonna open
up gaming for a lot

31
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.720
of people. Oh yes. One
of the things when the

32
00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.590
X-Box adaptive controller had been
announced, it was still in

33
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.030
development when they actually announced
the price. It blew everyone's

34
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.670
mind because normally when you
have accessibility issues and you

35
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.190
need to get special equipment
for that, that can run

36
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.060
in the hundreds and hundreds
of dollars, very easily for

37
00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.370
some of the modified controllers.
And so with the accessible

38
00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.440
controller, it allows you to
get what you need for

39
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.910
a very small price. Yeah.
It's, it's, it's amazing. So

40
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.790
what is your mobility issue?
So my mobility issue is

41
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.660
what they call hemiplegia. And
what that means is that

42
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:45.380
your entire one side of
your body is affected. So

43
00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.550
all the systems on my
right side, actually, and you

44
00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.590
may be able to tell
I have a slight list,

45
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.920
but because it even affects
the side of my tongue

46
00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.250
a little bit, everything on
my right side is affected,

47
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.150
Including I have, I wear
a size seven and a

48
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.040
half shoe on my right
and a nine and a

49
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.670
half on my left. And,
And there's a hemiplegia. It

50
00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:17.910
means like hemisphere Hemp, like
quadriplegia or hemiplegia, it means

51
00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.200
that the hemisphere, the entire
hemisphere, or how am I

52
00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.270
sighed, I guess never really
thought about that, but is,

53
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.780
is totally affected. So I
have really no fine control

54
00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.630
on my right side, on
my right hand at all.

55
00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.910
So I type with one
hand and do pretty much

56
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.510
everything with one hand. But
when you're playing Xbox games,

57
00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.450
typically you need two hands.
There's two triggers. There's two,

58
00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.610
two joysticks. There's the deep
head there's buttons. There's, you

59
00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.570
know, upper triggers, there's lower
triggers. And it can be

60
00:03:54.570 --> 00:04:00.720
frustrating for people with mobility
issues or, you know, sensory

61
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.750
issues or, you know, vision
or something like that. And

62
00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.550
they can't really play. So
using the accessibility controller allows

63
00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:13.020
you to plug in all
sorts of external controllers so

64
00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.110
that you can use. So
for example, I use to,

65
00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:22.320
X-Box not X-Box to rock
band drum pedals for my

66
00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.970
triggers. You haven't really Okay.
So I have rock band

67
00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.140
and the, the rock band,
orange drum pedal, it's like

68
00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.670
the, the, you know, controller
it's orange and I got

69
00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:39.150
it at Goodwill and it
has a 3.5 millimeter. It

70
00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.400
looks like a headphone Jack
on the end of it.

71
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.640
Right? And so you can
plug in on the back

72
00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:52.710
of the controller itself, there
are 3.5 millimeter controllers for

73
00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:58.020
jacks for the controllers, and
pretty much any button, any

74
00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.430
trigger has a spot along
the back that you can

75
00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.740
plug in. And the reason
they did that, it's all

76
00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.860
in a line so that
people with mobility issues or

77
00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.760
dexterity issues, it's not, you
know, they're not like a

78
00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.340
stacked one on top of
the other, anything. They worked

79
00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:21.750
a long time with different
agencies, different charities to really

80
00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.350
work out the design on
this. And it was one

81
00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:29.790
of the, the, the things
out of the inclusive technology

82
00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.190
lab. And I don't know
Scott, if you've ever been

83
00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.450
there, but it's an amazing,
amazing place that, that they,

84
00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.850
that they do the designs
for, for things like the

85
00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:43.200
accessible controller. And I know
that several other companies and

86
00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:49.620
organizations have used the expertise
now of the inclusive technologies

87
00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:56.790
lab for different, for different
offerings. Well, well, before we

88
00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:59.120
get the, like the techie
Parts of how it works

89
00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.890
and what it does, let
me back up a second.

90
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.780
You've been a gamer for
years though. I mean, I've

91
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.810
known, I've known you for,
I don't know, 15 years,

92
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:09.430
how were you playing Xbox
before? I was usually the

93
00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:14.110
standard meat, meat target for
my kids inhaler, you know,

94
00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.240
I was the practice dummy.
So I would, you know,

95
00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.370
like for example, if you're
trying to play something that,

96
00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:23.650
that needs both joysticks, I
would typically, you know, either

97
00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:26.140
turn the controller around sometimes
or put it on the

98
00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:29.530
side and then hit it
with one part, you know,

99
00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:31.690
and then try to move
a little bit with the

100
00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:34.330
other. So, like, for example,
in the first person shooter

101
00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:39.160
games, you have the navigation
where you're running around with

102
00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.080
your feet, but then you
twist at the waist with

103
00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.270
the other one. And that's
where I would usually have

104
00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:45.700
the problem. I'd have to
move and then quickly twists

105
00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.830
with their waist. And by
that point, you know, I'm

106
00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:52.330
spawning again. So, so for
the most part, for quite

107
00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.180
a while, I haven't played
console based games. I've just

108
00:06:55.180 --> 00:07:00.190
played PC based games. And,
And then how did you

109
00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:01.780
do that? Was it because
the PC you've got the

110
00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:04.660
keyboard and the mouse and
you can rearrange things, maybe

111
00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:06.760
move the mouse to the
right side, but you're still

112
00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.890
only trying to do all
of this with just right,

113
00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:11.380
Right. And you're still doing
it with basically one hand.

114
00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:13.810
You can use the, you
can use some of the,

115
00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:17.800
like on the keyboard, the
arrow controllers, or, you know,

116
00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:21.700
WASD or something like that
with your other hand somewhat,

117
00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:23.680
and then move the mouse
or whatever you need to,

118
00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:27.430
but still, it's a, it's
kind of frustrating sometimes. And

119
00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.560
so being able to do
that, you know, you kind

120
00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.060
of pick and choose the
games you want to play.

121
00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:35.860
So I've been, you know,
for a long time and

122
00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.290
playing things like Civ and,
and those sorts of things,

123
00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:41.950
which aren't as much of
a Twitch game as, as

124
00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:47.080
other things. So there's a
huge gaming community though, out

125
00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:50.710
there before the Xbox, at
draft of controller, that would

126
00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:54.490
just basically say, we're going
to solve this now. Whether,

127
00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:56.740
whether we have support from
a company or not, right.

128
00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:00.460
There's like the able gamers
charity and there's special effect.

129
00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:05.920
And there's cerebral palsy foundation.
People were building solutions. I've

130
00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:08.530
seen out of wood and
tape and wires that they

131
00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:12.370
made themselves. And, and this
was a, a very DIY

132
00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:15.730
community. Like they, they were
gonna, they were in a

133
00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:17.980
game and no one's going
to let them, no, one's

134
00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:21.220
going to stop them. Right.
Right. In fact, that's a

135
00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:24.340
good point. Back in the
early eighties, when I had

136
00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:27.580
my Atari, there was a,
an article in an Atari

137
00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:31.660
age at the time that
showed you how to unscrew

138
00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:36.100
it and then rear rewire
the circuit board. So you

139
00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:39.550
could make it a left
handed controller. Wow. So I

140
00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:42.580
did that so that I
could use the fire button

141
00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:46.720
on the left hand side.
But yeah, there were so

142
00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:50.710
many, there have been so
many charities and people just

143
00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:54.010
spending their own time as
bankers to help other people

144
00:08:55.290 --> 00:09:00.120
modify different controllers or hook
them up to a, maybe

145
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.210
a breath like a straw.
So you could use that

146
00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:05.550
for the fire button or
something like that to allow

147
00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:10.110
people to escape the prison,
if you will, or the,

148
00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:13.620
the frustration of having a
body that a mind that's

149
00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:18.860
trapped inside that's mobility limited,
limited body <inaudible>. Yeah. And

150
00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:21.290
I understand that a couple
of a couple of years

151
00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:26.390
ago, the kind of famous
modern Ben heck B E

152
00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:30.140
N H E C K
created X-Box one single handed

153
00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:33.680
controllers, which solves problem for
a single handed person. But

154
00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:37.820
there's a, there's a diversity
of limited mobility issues, right.

155
00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:40.820
Someone might not simply have
only one arm, you know,

156
00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:42.950
like you, you can use
your other hand to do

157
00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:45.170
some stuff. Like it could
be a trigger hand. Right,

158
00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:48.110
Right. It's a, I can
use it to grasp, I

159
00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:52.100
can use it on anything,
you know, of course, a

160
00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:55.820
course ability, not finally I
can grasp so I can,

161
00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:58.640
you know, use it for
a, for a trigger it's

162
00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:02.960
just harder to do, especially
with the, the way that

163
00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:06.950
the is molded. But it's
really interesting because the way

164
00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:11.660
that the, the adaptive controller
came about was in 2014.

165
00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:14.510
And I don't remember who
it was that was scrolling

166
00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:17.750
through Twitter, but they were,
they saw a tweet by

167
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:22.640
warfighter engaged. Who's a nonprofit
organization that provides gaming devices

168
00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:25.520
to wounded vets. And so
they saw that saw this

169
00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:31.040
photo and they reached out
to that two warfighter and

170
00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:34.430
started learning how difficult it
was. And, and so there

171
00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:37.730
was a hackathon at the
2015 ability summit, and a

172
00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:40.670
group of employees decided to
put together a team to

173
00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:44.930
develop a solution for accessible
gaming. And so they worked

174
00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:49.760
with Ken Jones, who's the,
the leader of warfighter engaged.

175
00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:53.270
And they developed at that
point, a gaming device that

176
00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:58.130
used connect to track a
gamer's movements and translated translate

177
00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:01.700
them as if they were
inputs from a traditional wireless

178
00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:06.020
controller. Wow. And it does
make you wonder though why

179
00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:08.300
it took so long. Like
if you were hacking your

180
00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:11.460
Atari in the eighties, doesn't
it feel like this, this

181
00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:14.960
should have been a thing
a long time ago? Yeah.

182
00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:17.420
I think part of it
is, is that, you know,

183
00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:20.090
sometimes people are just going
about their lives and they

184
00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:22.940
just, they don't see it.
And, you know, it's, it's

185
00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:25.160
not that it's good or
bad or anything. They just

186
00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:29.390
don't see it. I think
a really, a lot of

187
00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:34.010
companies now for whatever reason
are really trying to focus

188
00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:37.940
on accessibility. I mean, if
you look at Tommy Hilfiger

189
00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:42.080
now has a line of
Tommy accessible clothing. And so

190
00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:47.510
they have magnetic clasps for
your buttons for your shirt.

191
00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:49.430
So it still looks like
buttons on a, on a

192
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:54.220
dress shirt, but it's actually
a magnetic class. And Nike,

193
00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:56.350
I tried these on and
they didn't work for me,

194
00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:59.650
but they have as part
of their flies, their fly

195
00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:03.970
line, a high top that
zips all the way around

196
00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:08.980
with Velcro. See that you
can basically, instead of using

197
00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:12.400
shoestrings, you can zip all
the way around it and

198
00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.740
close it, it kind of
opens it. It kind of

199
00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:16.450
opens the shoe up and
then kind of zips it

200
00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:21.630
around there. So Small, small,
and clever design things that

201
00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:24.780
can fundamentally change how someone
is able to just move

202
00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:28.650
through their, their everyday life.
Like this is absolutely, this

203
00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:31.350
is just a, it's the
organizational willpower to do it.

204
00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:35.130
And that's why, you know,
one of the reasons why

205
00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:41.190
I love Microsoft because they,
they decided to do this.

206
00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:43.770
They put, you know, they
put their money where their

207
00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:46.950
mouth was and created something
that's very affordable and very,

208
00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:50.700
very flexible. You can use
it on both the piece

209
00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:54.930
on both windows 10 and
on the Xbox itself. And

210
00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:57.840
so you can configure it
however you need to. In

211
00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:01.770
fact, it has oversized buttons
to oversized buttons, and I've

212
00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:05.430
got two other oversized buttons.
So I just took a

213
00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:07.920
picture of a regular Xbox
controller with the X, Y

214
00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:10.890
AB blew it up and
then put it on the

215
00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:17.040
buttons and created that diamond,
that diamond configuration and use

216
00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:19.380
it, use the button. So
that way with my right

217
00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:23.130
hand. Interesting. So we're on
a podcast, of course. So

218
00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:25.410
people will have to go
and link and go and

219
00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:27.420
search for images for this,
but let's describe it. It

220
00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:30.990
looks like it looks like
a DJ turntable. It's, it's

221
00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:35.010
a white rectangle. It's a
very attractive controller. It matches

222
00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:38.670
the Xbox style with two
big black buttons on it

223
00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:41.850
that are several inches wide
that looked like they could

224
00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:45.300
be turntables, but they're actually
buttons. There's a, a small

225
00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:50.850
D pad, presumably for setup
starting start and select buttons,

226
00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:55.290
but it's rather, it's rather
Spartan, but if you flip

227
00:13:55.290 --> 00:14:00.750
it around on the backside,
there's 19 3.5 millimeter jacks

228
00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:05.250
and multiple USB ports. This
is not a controller as

229
00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:09.240
it is a controller toolkit.
Right. Right. And that's the

230
00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:12.570
main thing is that it's
not necessarily the controller itself,

231
00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:13.620
but it's almost, I don't
want to say it's a

232
00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:17.700
framework, but it's a platform.
It's an ecosystem. Right. Right.

233
00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:21.840
And the interesting thing about
it is on the controller

234
00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:23.580
itself. Yes. It has a
deep pad and you can

235
00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:27.000
map the Xbox controller deep
pad to that, right. The

236
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:33.240
pad, You can also then
using a technology also that

237
00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.610
came out, I think in
like 2014 or 2015 called

238
00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:42.930
copilot and copilot is an
Xbox technology that allows two

239
00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:46.830
controllers to work as one.
Right. And that's a software

240
00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:49.230
based thing. I've actually done
that with my kids before

241
00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:53.480
they, right before they became
able to really play, you

242
00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:55.760
know, I could move the
head of the character and

243
00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:58.510
they could move the body
kind of thing. Right. And

244
00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:02.770
in the same way, the
accessible controller takes advantage of

245
00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:05.800
using copilot. You can, you
can use it with a

246
00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:11.650
regular controller and then map
from that controller onto. So

247
00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:13.960
if you want to use,
you know, in one hand

248
00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:15.430
you want to use the
controller and then the big

249
00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:18.280
buttons of the accessible controller,
you can absolutely do that.

250
00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:22.330
And there's a little button
on the X on the

251
00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:26.200
accessible controller with three lights
next to it. And those

252
00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:29.170
are for the mapping profiles
that you use. So you

253
00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:32.020
get into the Xbox and
you turn on copilot and

254
00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:34.210
it says, okay, do you
want to map these things?

255
00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:37.900
And so like, for example,
I've mapped the right joystick

256
00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:42.520
to the D pad on
the accessible controller. So you

257
00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:46.540
can map anything to anything,
right. And on the back

258
00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:49.270
of these, these 3.5 millimeter
devices, this is basically a

259
00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:53.200
headphone Jack, but it's, it's
not for headphones. If you

260
00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:56.680
we've all looked at these,
these, these plugs before they

261
00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:59.740
usually have stripes, there's either
like a, a mano or

262
00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:03.280
a digital input, there's a
stereo or three stripes. And

263
00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:06.400
you can use those for,
for digital, like a button

264
00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:09.670
pushing it on and off,
or for analog things like

265
00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:13.540
joysticks and it'll support all
of these different things where

266
00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:16.480
switches or buttons totally up
to you. So you can

267
00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:20.530
do remapping and software and
physical mapping in hardware. Yes.

268
00:16:20.770 --> 00:16:23.440
So that means that like
this, this button that you

269
00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:27.160
have, the, the, the one
from rock band, is that

270
00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:28.990
an on, off, or is
that a trigger where you

271
00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:31.720
could push it slightly? And
it's like an analog We're

272
00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:34.150
going to put a, you
can push it slightly. It's

273
00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:38.080
when you plug the pedal
into the back of the

274
00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:42.190
controller for, it has a
little symbol for right trigger.

275
00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:44.200
You can plug that, you
plug that right in there.

276
00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:48.130
And yeah, it's, it is,
I believe it's an, it's

277
00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:51.940
gotta be analog because it,
it totally handles the pressure.

278
00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:55.420
Just, just, That's amazing. It's
just a big foot trigger.

279
00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:58.360
And if I'm putting all
of this in the show

280
00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:00.400
notes, because I want people
to see these, if they

281
00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:04.000
can, it's pretty amazing. It's,
it's an ecosystem because it's

282
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.610
open and it's not being
prescriptive. And I think this

283
00:17:06.610 --> 00:17:11.230
is important. The adaptive controller
is not saying use it

284
00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:15.430
like this. It's just a,
it's a series of ports

285
00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:17.920
and possibilities. And if you
go on the show notes

286
00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:21.220
and look at our, under
a system, these are the

287
00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:23.410
accessories you can get. Like
you can Mount it to

288
00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:26.840
your leg. You can Mount
it to your wheelchair, wheelchair,

289
00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:31.300
arm, mounts for the controller
itself, or, you know, mounting

290
00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:32.440
it in any way that
you want. So there's a

291
00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.750
whole ecosystem around it. One
of these ones that's really

292
00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:37.660
interesting is called the quad
stick. So it's a sip

293
00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:40.780
and puff mouth stick that
can be used, right. To,

294
00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:43.720
to map directly to the
Xbox controller. If you want

295
00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:46.300
to fire with your mouth,
you can do that. I

296
00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:49.950
believe there's also, somebody makes
a tracking device that you

297
00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:53.100
can use. So you, so
you can use that to

298
00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:56.540
move. There's all sorts of
things. Oh, wow. Oh. And

299
00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:58.730
it would actually map directly
to the joystick. So it's

300
00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:01.340
a head tracker, but it's
the Xbox doesn't know it

301
00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:04.880
is. It just thinks it's
a joystick. Right. And you

302
00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:09.050
talked about the wheelchair Mount
and there, the way that

303
00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:11.060
that happens is if you
flip the coin, if you

304
00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:15.440
flip it over, there are
several screw mounts in there

305
00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:20.180
of different sizes that match
a lot of medical, what

306
00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:22.940
medical devices he would use.
So it matches right. To

307
00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:26.660
like a wheelchair Mount. Oh.
So if I understand correctly,

308
00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:29.720
you know how, when you,
like, I've bought a cameras

309
00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:32.120
and there's a standard for
how the camera attaches to

310
00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:35.180
the tripod, and then maybe
you'll look at another device

311
00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:37.280
that you purchase and you
go, Oh, this fits on

312
00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:39.680
top of the tripod because
it uses the same screw

313
00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:43.310
style and size. So you're
saying that there are standards

314
00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:46.340
for mounts. So all of
these things just, just physically

315
00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:50.300
work together. Right. And so
it's, it's, it's really neat.

316
00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:54.290
The amount of thought that
has gone into this, and

317
00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:56.690
yeah, both one of the
things I'm looking at a

318
00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:59.180
picture of this right now,
and on the backside of

319
00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:02.450
the controller with all those
three and a half a

320
00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:06.830
millimeter jacks, there are symbols
on the top. So you

321
00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:09.050
can look down and see
which ones you're, you're needing

322
00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:12.470
to. But then also on
the back in high contrast

323
00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:17.570
and black, larger, there are
symbols right underneath each one

324
00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:23.120
of those as well. So
they've really thought about the

325
00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:26.870
nuances that you might need.
I was involved in the,

326
00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:30.020
in the beta program of
this, and even between the

327
00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:34.550
last beta of the hardware
and the release, they put

328
00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:39.410
a very subtle curve in
the top so that you,

329
00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:43.340
it, it would be a
little bit better ergonomically. Interesting.

330
00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:45.050
And the other thing I
think is worth pointing out

331
00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:47.960
is while it's trying not
to be prescriptive, it's allowing

332
00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:54.050
for accessory makers to themselves
be, be prescriptive, depending on

333
00:19:54.050 --> 00:19:56.980
what you need. For example,
I figured, Oh, well, and

334
00:19:57.220 --> 00:20:00.080
this is speaking from a
relatively able-bodied perspective. I figured,

335
00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:02.540
Oh, well, maybe they'll just
make big buttons, like big,

336
00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:06.380
giant buttons. Right. Which is
a very simplistic way for

337
00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:08.270
me to think. Right. But
I go, and I look

338
00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:12.170
at these accessories from a
company called AbleNet. They have

339
00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:15.890
big switches, which makes sense,
but they also have micro

340
00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:18.860
light switches, switches that will
click with just the slightest

341
00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:23.480
amount of touch or switches,
like a button that happens

342
00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:25.610
when you grab it or
grasp it, or pull it

343
00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:29.930
to one side, or they've
got a jelly bean switch,

344
00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:33.230
which is squishy, but in
not going to hurt you,

345
00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:35.030
if you, if you, if
you pound on it, like

346
00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:39.140
these are all different ways
to send binary information. But

347
00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:42.230
each one for, you know,
it doesn't look like a

348
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:44.060
switch in the, in the,
in the, in the simplistic

349
00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:45.710
way. I was going to
think that it would look

350
00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:48.490
like right. And that's a
neat thing. I'm glad you

351
00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:52.000
brought up AbleNet because they've
done a wonderful amount for

352
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.700
a lot of people. And
if you go out to

353
00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:56.570
Abel net, one of the
things you'll see on, on

354
00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:59.410
some of the pictures is
it looks like there's almost

355
00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:03.280
a coding over the button.
And the reason, like almost

356
00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:06.610
a plastic transparent coating over
the button. The reason that

357
00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:10.870
is, is for people that
have issues controlling their mouth.

358
00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:14.860
I know of, of a
young man who had, has

359
00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:20.500
wasted several controllers because as
he gets excited through roll

360
00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:22.690
comes out, a lot of
drool comes out and it,

361
00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:26.620
it destroys the controller. So
they even take those sorts

362
00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:30.070
of things into account. And
so it's amazing the small

363
00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:33.040
details that they really look
at to be able to

364
00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:37.680
make sure that it's the
best experience possible, A big

365
00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:39.780
thank you to our sponsors

381
00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:41.370
device has, has software to
support it. And it's firmware

382
00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:44.790
updatable, and I, and it
uploads into windows. So you

383
00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:46.440
program it, you get it
all set up, and then

384
00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:48.960
you can gain both on
Xbox and on in your

385
00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:52.110
windows game And your steam
games. Yes. And then you

386
00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:54.000
just have to map it
however you want. And I

387
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.310
noticed that there's also a
one handed joystick. It was

388
00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:59.550
kind of like a wee
nunchuck. Have you tried that

389
00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:02.190
as a one handed a
user? I haven't, I've tried.

390
00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:04.740
I've used the weed nunchuck
several times, but I haven't

391
00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:08.310
actually used that one yet.
The next one I'm actually

392
00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:11.520
getting is called a 3d
control. I don't remember the

393
00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:13.770
name of it, but it
allows you to move things

394
00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:16.890
with your, basically with your
feet completely with your feet.

395
00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:20.880
It's almost like a balance,
a balance board that you

396
00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:23.490
might use, like when you're
doing a Pilates or something.

397
00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:26.840
Oh, right. There's the 3d
rudder foot controller. Yes. Yes.

398
00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:29.610
It's the 3d rudder. And
so I've got that actually

399
00:23:29.610 --> 00:23:33.330
on an order to play
with to see how I

400
00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:34.830
can use that. And one
of the things I want

401
00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:40.590
to potentially do with that
is help people with accessibility

402
00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:45.230
issues have a better experience
programming. And so maybe the

403
00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:47.690
3d rudder, they can move
the mouse a little bit

404
00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:50.300
better, or find a way
to create some macros for

405
00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:53.000
it. When they're using something
like visual studio code or

406
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.610
visual studio or whatever, to
be able to help that

407
00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:58.990
a little bit more. Now,
I think I know the

408
00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:02.530
answer to this, to this
question, but I've watched my

409
00:24:02.530 --> 00:24:04.030
10 year old, my 12
year old kind of like

410
00:24:04.030 --> 00:24:06.550
develop their skills to be
able to like me, you

411
00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:09.160
know, when you first start
like a first person shooter,

412
00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:12.340
you're walking around and you
can't quite figure out that

413
00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:14.350
the right thumb is your
head and the left thumb

414
00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:15.910
is your body. And you
end up looking up at

415
00:24:15.910 --> 00:24:19.720
the sky or looking down.
And eventually that becomes, you

416
00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:24.100
know, second nature, right after
you set this controller up

417
00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:27.280
and your custom accessories, the
way you want it, whether

418
00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:29.290
it be on a Mount
of your own or a

419
00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:32.350
table, or however, you've set
yourself up, how long does

420
00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:34.210
it take and what does
it like? Does it become

421
00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:37.900
intuitive where you just immediately
know that moving your knee

422
00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:39.880
to the right is the
right trigger and moving into

423
00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:41.410
the left is the left
trigger, or however you set

424
00:24:41.410 --> 00:24:44.680
it up, does it become
natural? Yes. It's just a,

425
00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:47.470
it becomes a habit just
like with any, anything else.

426
00:24:47.470 --> 00:24:50.380
At least it has in
my case. And the neat

427
00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:53.440
thing is, is that if
you have multiple people that

428
00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:56.890
want to use this, you
can have multiple profiles set

429
00:24:56.890 --> 00:24:59.740
up or maybe something works
a little bit better. Another

430
00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:03.760
configuration works better for a
driving game versus a first

431
00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:07.930
person shooter game. You could
have another mapping and change

432
00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:11.200
the change, the controls around
to what makes sense for

433
00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:15.670
that particular game. Wow. Okay.
So the, the controller I

434
00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:19.390
understand is a USBC. It's
got a battery inside. It

435
00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:21.550
really acts like an Xbox
controller. It uses the same,

436
00:25:21.550 --> 00:25:25.150
X-Box wireless. It pairs just
like an Xbox controller. Cause

437
00:25:25.150 --> 00:25:27.820
it is an Xbox controller.
Yeah. For all intents and

438
00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:31.240
purposes, the Xbox thinks it's
an actual controller and they've

439
00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:33.220
used a, I know the
exclusive lab when they were

440
00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:37.720
working on this and the
Xbox hardware team even went

441
00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:41.140
so far is to make
sure that as you're using

442
00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:45.760
this on like for online
tournaments or stuff or things,

443
00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:50.890
I'm sorry, it uses the
anti cheating things that X-Box

444
00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:53.860
would normally use anyway. So
it's not anything that would

445
00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:58.300
be an competitive advantage or
anything like that. They've, they've

446
00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:01.480
tried to make sure that
it just levels the playing

447
00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:04.420
field. Speaking of leveling the
playing field at the beginning

448
00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:07.480
of this podcast, you told
me that when you were

449
00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:10.420
playing before you were effectively,
the, you said the meat

450
00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:13.600
Good for your kids. Yes.
Is this level of, have

451
00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:15.370
you been able to poll
in your kids because that

452
00:26:15.370 --> 00:26:19.000
really is the, the goal,
Right? That's the goal, the

453
00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.960
gold standard. And I, I
am now able to hold

454
00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:25.990
at least hold my own.
I get, maybe I get

455
00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:28.060
maybe a couple of, or
two or three kills in

456
00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:30.580
now, before I, before I
get killed. So I'm a

457
00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:33.820
little more challenging me targets.
So, but I have been

458
00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:36.280
able to play almost all
the way through fallout four

459
00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:40.870
with this controller in the
combat scenes and everything else

460
00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:45.780
very effectively. And so I'm
super excited about that. And

461
00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:48.420
then, I don't know if
you saw the launch video

462
00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:52.560
that I'm in with my
fake family there, you do

463
00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:55.560
a fake family. Yeah. At
the a, and w we

464
00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:57.570
do it at the, it
was filmed at the exclusive

465
00:26:57.570 --> 00:27:00.660
lab, but the game that
I'm playing, they just took

466
00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:03.120
about 15 or 20 minutes
of us playing the games.

467
00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:06.390
I'm actually really into it
because it was like a

468
00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:09.390
street fighter game. And I
was actually winning against the

469
00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:15.150
young man that I was
playing against. Whereas before I

470
00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:17.280
would have gotten an, a
couple of shots, but now

471
00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:22.170
with the ability to use
those buttons and, and remap

472
00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:25.200
the controller, it, it just
opened things up and it

473
00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:29.400
just made, it makes it
another way. I don't want

474
00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:32.130
to say in other ways,
dreary existence, because it's not

475
00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:35.760
really, but it's, you know,
you want to play the

476
00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:38.490
games could because you're a
gamer and it gives you

477
00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:41.790
that ability to feel like,
yeah, I can, I can

478
00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:46.640
participate. You know, something else
that's worth pointing out. You

479
00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:49.520
kept mentioning the attention to
detail and the little things

480
00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:55.370
they even made the packaging
yes. Accessible. So like how

481
00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:57.740
often have we all had
to go and find a

482
00:27:57.740 --> 00:28:00.110
knife or a struggle to
open up the carpet? This

483
00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:03.380
thing kind of unfolds itself,
like a flower. And it

484
00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:06.920
has this amazing packaging, both
the, the cardboard around it.

485
00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:09.650
And then the internal box.
It's not packaging that you

486
00:28:09.650 --> 00:28:12.290
would want to throw. No,
actually, I'm, I've still have

487
00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:15.080
the beta version. And I'm
going to, I'm trading that

488
00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:18.710
in for the actual, the
actual release version. And I

489
00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:22.910
can't wait to see the
packaging because the listeners ought

490
00:28:22.910 --> 00:28:25.190
to know that they spent
even, they spent four years

491
00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:27.920
on the controller, but they
spent an entire year on

492
00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:31.850
the packaging. And the way
you open it is with

493
00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:34.040
a little ring that you
just pull back and it

494
00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:37.310
pulls some very, not real
sticky tape off. And then,

495
00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:39.710
yeah, it just unfolds like
a flower, but then it

496
00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:44.990
also slides out gently on
a cardboard, a kind of

497
00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:47.660
lift if you will, so
that you don't have to

498
00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:49.310
re you can just kind
of scoop it off if

499
00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:53.120
you need to. Yeah, exactly.
They're, they're, they're these loops

500
00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:57.500
and they, they set a
standard for no teeth. Yep.

501
00:28:57.830 --> 00:29:01.130
For the package designers, because
people with limited mobility will

502
00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:04.280
often have to use their
teeth to, to open packaging,

503
00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:07.130
which is not, not the
best out of box experience.

504
00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:09.410
Yes. Now, but you get
pretty good at it sometimes,

505
00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:14.270
Unfortunately. So we can get
this where Microsoft stores and

506
00:29:14.270 --> 00:29:17.600
online. Yes. Right now, I
believe it's just at the

507
00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:22.040
micro stores and on back
Microsoft stores and online. But

508
00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:26.420
I have a feeling that
once, once production gets totally

509
00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:28.460
ramped up and everything, that
you'll be able to get

510
00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:31.250
it at best buy or
wherever, you know, Hey, you're

511
00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:35.300
at your local store, maybe.
Yeah. That's fantastic. I'm curious.

512
00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:37.880
Also, do you know if
it has a headset adapter

513
00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:39.920
as well? Like the thing
that I'm always impressed with

514
00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:42.550
my Xbox controllers is I
just plug the headphones in

515
00:29:42.970 --> 00:29:46.600
and they wirelessly bring the
sound over. So back in

516
00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:49.360
the day, I used to
actually have wireless headphones that

517
00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:52.060
were custom and separate. I
plugged into my stereo. And

518
00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:55.750
now the Xbox controller is
itself a, a headphone transmitter.

519
00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:58.810
Yep. I'm not sure about
the wireless headphones. I would

520
00:29:58.810 --> 00:30:02.620
assume that since it's using
it can be done, you

521
00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:04.900
can use it as a
wireless controller. I would assume

522
00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:07.120
that it acts as a
wireless headphones. I guess that's

523
00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:09.400
what I'm saying, right? Well
there, yeah. Cause there is

524
00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:11.140
a three and a half
inch or three and a

525
00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:13.990
half millimeter Jack on the
left side that has a

526
00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:16.180
headphone above it. Yeah. You
can use headphones with it.

527
00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:21.850
Fantastic. See, I, you know,
I think I don't have

528
00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:25.240
mobility issues, but I have
had mobility issues. And I

529
00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:27.520
think this is a thing
for those of us who

530
00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:29.920
are listening to this podcast
who may not have those

531
00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:33.640
issues right now, you just
never know I've had, I've

532
00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:36.550
had frozen shoulder surgery where
I had no mobility in

533
00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:40.570
my left arm for two
years. I had a carpal

534
00:30:40.570 --> 00:30:43.570
tunnel surgery on my right
hand. And I've got a

535
00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:45.790
bone spur in my thumb
right now where my right

536
00:30:45.790 --> 00:30:50.890
hand gaming is painful. We,
we, as we, as relatively

537
00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:55.540
able bodied, people should not
think about technologies like this

538
00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:58.120
as being, you know, Oh,
this is just for people

539
00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:00.250
in wheelchair or this is
just for people with serious

540
00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:03.940
mobility issues. This is really
about making it for everybody.

541
00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:07.030
Like this is what inclusion
means. It's yes. It's for

542
00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:10.510
players with different disabilities or
different abilities, but it may

543
00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:14.350
be well for you. If
someday, if, if something goes

544
00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:16.540
awry in a, in a
body part that you don't

545
00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:18.910
expect, I did not expect
to get frozen shoulder or

546
00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:22.030
have hand issues, but it's
nice to know the controllers

547
00:31:22.030 --> 00:31:26.020
like this exist if I
ever need them. Yes. And

548
00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:28.720
it, it's just another way
to, like you said, be

549
00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:32.140
inclusive and give an Avenue
to people so that they

550
00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:35.470
can participate. Fantastic. All right.
Well, thanks so much, John Alexander

551
00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:37.720
for chatting with me today,
Scott, it's always a pleasure

552
00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:41.050
to talk to you. I
appreciate that this has been

553
00:31:41.050 --> 00:31:43.840

we'll see you again next

554
