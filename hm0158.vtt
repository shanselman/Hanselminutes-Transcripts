this episode, Scott talks with
Joel Spolsky from fog Creek

9
00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.570
software. Hi, this is Scott
Hanselman and this is another

10
00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.880
episode of Hansel minutes and
I'm down here in New York

11
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.730
on wall street, hanging out
with Joel Spolsky at the

12
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:12.260
fog Creek software. What are
we on 25th floor here?

13
00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.760
Yep. World headquarters, the world
headquarters of fog Creek. Thanks

14
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.110
for taking the time to
chat with me and invited

15
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.330
me down. And we had
a lovely catered lunch and

16
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.730
I, I thought it was
for me. Thanks for having

17
00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.830
me on the show. Now
we have lunch here every

18
00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.110
day was brought in at
about noon. Yeah, I have

19
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.590
pretty good caterer, so that's
pretty sweet, happy. So we

20
00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.660
were just sitting here chatting,
and then I realized that,

21
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.280
you know, shoot, we should
just record this. So I

22
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.390
figured we'd bust out the,
the, the recording equipment and,

23
00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.520
and chat. You guys make
fog bugs and that's the

24
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.050
product that you're known for.
And you're coming out with

25
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.930
fog bugs seven. Yeah, five
weeks seven should be going

26
00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.230
into beta on Friday for
the very first couple of

27
00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.390
beta tests. Friday will probably
be the day that this

28
00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.580
podcast will go up. So
that'll be today. Okay. So

29
00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.250
congratulations on the release. Send
me if you're a fog

30
00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.380
box user and you want
to try out the early

31
00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.860
versions of the beta, just
Twitter me at, at Spolsky

32
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.060
cool. A couple of years
ago, I was reading about

33
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.400
how you guys wrote this
in the language that you

34
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.430
were. And I thought that
was really interesting cause originally

35
00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.650
this was in VB script.
Yeah. I mean, five weeks

36
00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.650
has been around for absolutely
ages. And in fact, the

37
00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.500
very first, the very first
early version and it's all

38
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.710
been rewritten, but very, very
early versions. I wrote just

39
00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.290
to learn VB script when
I first came out and

40
00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.320
I think there was a
window of opportunity there. I

41
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.200
mean, this is before Java.
This is before anything when

42
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.980
VB script was just about
the only reasonable Turing complete

43
00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.690
language you could find to
run on a web server.

44
00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.490
And this was like either
wanna do it in C

45
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.060
plus plus, right? Yeah. So,
so you did this in

46
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.540
VB script. So this was
ASP classic ASP classic ASP.

47
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.080
Yeah. All one file master
dot ASP. Now we had

48
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.760
a lot of little files
that were all included in

49
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.010
one big file. Yeah. But
you want it to be

50
00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.740
cross platform. That was really
important. The first, the first

51
00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.720
problem that we had, I
mean, we, we, we had

52
00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.550
this big code base and
VB script that we had

53
00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.840
a modified, it was very
clean. It was actually a

54
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.340
astonishingly clean, elegant well-structured code.
That was very, very functional.

55
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.250
And the first problem that
we had was a, is

56
00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.800
asking to be able to
run this on Unix, the

57
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.140
only solution for running VB
script on Unix with something

58
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.650
called chili soft, which was
a thousand dollars per server.

59
00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.120
And that it was kind
of expensive and we couldn't

60
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.570
get anybody to go for
that. And so what we

61
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:23.980
did is we took a
summer intern and said here,

62
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.620
write a VB script to
PHB compiler. So this is

63
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.200
a classic compiler. It's not
a translator. It had Alexa

64
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.820
in a parser and a
code generator. And the code

65
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:35.340
generator generated PHB, given VB
script. Why not? Why is

66
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.900
that not a translator? Well,
I get into debates debate

67
00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.900
all the time. No, I
know a compiler and a

68
00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.010
translator are basically the same
word. A compiler people sometimes

69
00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.320
think of a compiler as
being the thing which generates

70
00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.470
machine language or something, but
that's actually not true. Very

71
00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.100
rarely does it compilers generally
generate some other language. It

72
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.380
may or may not be
human readable. The old compilers

73
00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.200
generated assembler, which was human
readable, the first C plus

74
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.800
plus compilers generated C just
cause it was easier. And

75
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.080
then they had all the
existing C compilers available to

76
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.570
get into assembler. There was
no reason to take that

77
00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.760
extra step. And we took
that inspiration of the early

78
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.660
C plus plus compilers, which
were called seafront the, the

79
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.030
first ATM T C plus
plus compiler. We took that

80
00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.860
inspiration to say, well, let's
make a compiler. And instead

81
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.350
of going to the trouble
of generating something, which can

82
00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.420
be run at the machine
level, let's just generate PHB

83
00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:27.660
And you didn't see, she
didn't do this as a

84
00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.060
translator in the sense of
it wasn't as simple search

85
00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.460
and replace operation, right. This
thing that's not in the

86
00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.190
syntax tree and admitted another
Syntech story. Exactly. It basically

87
00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.000
did true Lexington parsing as
opposed to just some fancy

88
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.480
regular expressions. Okay, great. So
then at this point, they're

89
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.470
putting up PHP for the
Unix version and they're using

90
00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.010
the standard VB script on,
and this goes on for

91
00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:51.780
a number of versions and
people are happy and everyone

92
00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.960
is thrilled. Be the PHP.
I mean, PHB is not

93
00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.360
a good language, Scott. I
hate to say it really,

94
00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.600
Oh my God, the world
is, I want to explode

95
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.120
because it isn't, isn't the
Facebook, the operating system for

96
00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.180
the internet running entirely empty.
Maybe it is possible to,

97
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.120
you know, what good programmers
can write good clean code

98
00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.220
in any language, no matter
how bad it is. But

99
00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.940
there, there were just difficulties
that the PHP version always

100
00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.460
had issues. New versions of
PHP would come out with

101
00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.820
incompatibilities. There were just sort
of PHB never had good

102
00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.040
Unicode support. It was never,
they never really solved that

103
00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.090
problem correctly, all kinds of
issues around the way that

104
00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:30.780
references worked, worked and, and
passing a reference into a

105
00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.810
function. And just all that
kind of stuff was obviously

106
00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.820
invented by somebody that didn't
have a lot of computer

107
00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.630
language experience. And so there's
some fundamental mistakes Pre PHP

108
00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.330
five, and you're not enjoying
yourself at this point, Enjoying

109
00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.430
ourselves. Okay. And to this
day we don't enjoy our,

110
00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:47.880
our PHB port. And so
it still exists though. Well,

111
00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.620
I mean five bucks six,
which is like our current

112
00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.280
shipping version is PHB yet.
So it's yeah. It's at

113
00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.770
the point where we're still
releasing patches every once in

114
00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:58.550
a while. Okay. And is
that going To stop now?

115
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.720
Is that dead? Well, that's,
that's, that's dead for the

116
00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.640
public six train of thought.
Well, we do with five

117
00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:07.690
books, seven is almost a
complete rewrite of the compiler

118
00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:12.490
into a thing called Sabi
wasabi. The current version of

119
00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:16.660
wasabi takes, eh, a version
of VB script, which has

120
00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:18.490
added a lot of features.
We've added a lot of

121
00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:22.180
features to the input language,
the language that we compile.

122
00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:23.290
And just to give you
an idea of some of

123
00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:26.920
those features, they're all these
basically modern programming language features

124
00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.410
that are just starting to
show up in C sharp.

125
00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:31.870
So some of them are
like convenience features like the

126
00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:34.900
ability to have a string
that spans multiple lines, you

127
00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.000
know, like a really long
string using the triple quotes.

128
00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.120
Some of them are, and
that's a simple kind of

129
00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.750
convenience feature. Some of them
are necessary because we now

130
00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:47.470
generate a real CLR. So
we're, we're, we're now a

131
00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:51.280
dotnet language was hobby as
a.net language effectively. And So

132
00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.490
to be clear, you emit
assemblies that contain intermediate language

133
00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:57.340
and no one needs to
know that. Right. And it

134
00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:00.130
just works. And it runs
inside of, And it runs

135
00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:04.840
inside of CLR either on
either regular IAS or the

136
00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:09.040
Unix version, we'll run a
motto. And, and then we

137
00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.570
have ax, which is the
first class that in that

138
00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:13.810
language we can link with
C-sharp. Oh, all right. So

139
00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:15.850
you can, so you can
call other people's things. You're

140
00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:19.330
really our first class. Yep.
And do you have references

141
00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:22.270
to other assemblies that are
not written in wasabi? Yes.

142
00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:23.740
Five Oh seven. Well, if
I was seven, has a

143
00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:25.420
plugin architecture, you can write
plugins in any of that,

144
00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:27.190
in that language. So let
me kind of take a

145
00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:28.840
small tangent. I want to
come back to this, but,

146
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:31.780
but my first kind of
like visceral reaction is, but

147
00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:36.730
you make bug tracking software.
Why, why is there the

148
00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:39.040
6 billion people on the planet?
Some number of them are

149
00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:42.070
programmers. None of them had
a solution for you. So

150
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:45.970
your bug tracking software company
wrote a new line. Yeah.

151
00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:48.490
Well, I wouldn't say it's
a new language. I mean,

152
00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:50.950
we had, we have a
specific set of constraints that

153
00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.230
not a lot of other
people do. Number one, constraint

154
00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:56.380
was existing legacy code base
that worked, that was debugged

155
00:07:56.710 --> 00:08:00.370
in VB script. And VB
script is a bad language

156
00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:01.960
to program and it's missing
a bunch of stuff, but

157
00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:05.590
we added it. The truth
is I think a lot

158
00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:08.890
of the, the fundamental reaction,
I mean, there was a

159
00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:12.370
lot of reaction against wasabi
saying, you know, WTF is

160
00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:15.490
why are you guys running
a compiler? And I think

161
00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:17.230
that fundamentally comes from the
fact that a lot of

162
00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:22.330
programmers, especially a lot of,
well, I won't use nasty

163
00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:25.240
terminology. Let's just say a
lot of beginning to intermediate

164
00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.510
programmers might think that there's
something magical about a compiler,

165
00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:30.070
that this is too hard
for them to do that.

166
00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.320
A compiler is like an
operating system. It's for the

167
00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:35.530
gods of Redmond, Washington to
create, and maybe like a

168
00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:37.690
couple of geniuses that work
for Google, but this is

169
00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:39.700
not code that I could
ever write because it's something

170
00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:44.530
magical and incredible and mysterious.
And it's like creating Adams.

171
00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:47.160
You need a sub. I
remember my, I think Mike

172
00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:50.170
compiler class was a 300
level class. Yeah, yeah. 300

173
00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:53.440
levels. And so anybody that's
learned how to program Java

174
00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:56.400
at the Java in 21
course at the airport Marriott

175
00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:59.340
or who, you know, basically
learned how to program by

176
00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:03.690
downloading a sort of JavaScripts
from websites in the early.com.

177
00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:05.940
Boom. I think that a
compiler is something that they

178
00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:07.680
would have no idea how,
how to ever go about

179
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:10.410
doing that. But anybody that's
taken the compiler clot course

180
00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:16.560
knows that it's a one
semester project. And so you

181
00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:18.450
had an intern do it.
Yeah. We had a, we

182
00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:20.340
had an intern do it
later. We had a full

183
00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:21.990
time employee who worked on
it. But I mean, it's,

184
00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:23.490
we know that it's a
matter of a couple of

185
00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:26.240
weeks. So then, so you're
answering my kind of like

186
00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:28.880
when you're building a compiler
with, well, it's just not

187
00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:30.440
that big of a deal
to build a compiler. Correct.

188
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:32.960
We had a great code
base of input. Your input

189
00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.150
was really a domain specific
language at this point. I

190
00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:36.860
mean, you call it a
Sabi, but it's fog bugs,

191
00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:40.580
VB script, essentially. And it
was, you had a large

192
00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:44.780
existing DSL. Why not exploit
that? It was easier for

193
00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:46.220
us to do that than
to port. I mean, we

194
00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:49.070
just sat there and made
a decision. Do we write

195
00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:53.750
this compiler? Or do we
port all our existing code,

196
00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:58.940
right. VB under MVC, right.
Let's say, yeah. And this

197
00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:00.410
was, we just thought this
was an easier way to

198
00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:02.570
do it and would leave
us in control in a

199
00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:04.040
way, in a way that,
and I mean, we have

200
00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:06.080
wasabi is a better language
than either VB or C

201
00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.870
sharp for our needs, both
in the sense that it

202
00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:11.540
is guaranteed to correctly compile
our existing code, but also

203
00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:13.580
in the sense that we've
added features to it, that

204
00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:17.510
that, like, for example, type
in forensic complete type inference

205
00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:20.030
system that figures out the
type of everything with that

206
00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:23.510
are having to declare them.
And it works. It's better

207
00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:25.360
than the type of inconsistency
sharp because you can use,

208
00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.170
it works across parameters and
all that kind of stuff.

209
00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:30.740
It's the kind of thing
that a modern programming language

210
00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:33.800
has coming out of academia
by modern. I mean, 1990

211
00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.800
year old Haskell ML, I'll
have this type of inference.

212
00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:40.850
Devil's advocate a little bit.
Yeah. Could one read into

213
00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:43.550
what you're saying, and let's
say that someone's listening to

214
00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:46.460
this podcast and in their
mind, yeah. Maybe there's two

215
00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:49.310
or three people who are
listening and they're thinking, wow,

216
00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:52.520
supposedly it's like, blah, blah,
blah. I'm smarter than Andrews

217
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:56.660
now. Blah, blah, blah. Modern.
Definitely. It's in Jacob, the

218
00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:58.220
people that worked on the
compiler, but you know what

219
00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:00.140
I'm saying? I'm not Someone
could be hearing the same.

220
00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:03.500
Wow. What arrogance to go
and write a new language.

221
00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:06.020
Yeah. Do you look at
it that way? No. No.

222
00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:09.380
And why don't you Don't
forget. I don't think anybody

223
00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:11.060
else in the world you
use wasabi, otherwise we would

224
00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:13.190
give them services Exactly what
I was my next question

225
00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:16.160
was and why am I
not writing? Sorry. Unless you

226
00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.950
have a body of code
and VB script that happens

227
00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:20.960
to use the same subs
sub set of VB script

228
00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:24.080
as fog bugs does. This
is probably not the ideal

229
00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:26.420
language for you. It's not
a great, But he does

230
00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:28.520
then I suppose they'll call
you and you'll license it

231
00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:30.800
to them or If they
want, but what they'll discover

232
00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:34.040
People out there with a
lot of code in VB

233
00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:36.620
script class who would very
much thought about by calling

234
00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:39.320
ado and doing random? Well,
that's the thing We use.

235
00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:42.410
For example, we use probably
5% of what ADL makes

236
00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:45.710
available. And if somebody uses
a different 5%, we've never

237
00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:49.280
bothered implementing that. So there's
a bunch of stuff where

238
00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:51.110
like, like I said, there's
only one program that we

239
00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:52.760
have to go by with
wasabi and that makes it

240
00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:55.870
a very specific kind of
compiler and to actually make

241
00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:58.210
it something, Nikki, take any
arbitrary VB script that anybody's

242
00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:00.600
right. See, that's really interesting
when you said that you

243
00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:03.750
really, you wrote a compiler
that compiles, not just to

244
00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:06.930
propose one language, but it
really compiles to one program.

245
00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:09.300
So if they're interested in
compiling fog books, and this

246
00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:12.000
is the language for them.
Exactly. And in fact, I'll

247
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.500
get a free copy of
the compiler when they buy

248
00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:15.660
fog bugs, it'll be there
and the accessories directory so

249
00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:18.150
they can compile fog bugs.
Yeah. We ship, We ship

250
00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:20.820
with source. Now, when someone
creates a language, even as

251
00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:24.030
a language that compiles one
program, there's usually things like

252
00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:28.320
debugs debugging and debug stacks.
Yeah. Visual studio, really, it

253
00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.360
figures out everything for you.
And you're able to get

254
00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:35.400
the stack. The stack trace
looks like it points to

255
00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:37.830
the right line and says,
yeah, everything's cool. You know,

256
00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:39.390
I don't want to say
it's like the world's best

257
00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:44.130
debugging environment, but it's definitely
better than print ft. Debugging.

258
00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:46.530
Yeah. So it's not, you're
not, you're not doing the

259
00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:49.350
old style. Got here. Yeah.
Go here. Do it again.

260
00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:51.420
Now there are, there are
a couple of cases. The

261
00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:54.340
truth is that the dev
team here, if they could,

262
00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:56.910
would always write new code
would always rather write new

263
00:12:56.910 --> 00:13:00.630
code in C sharp. And
so w five bucks, seven

264
00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:03.000
has a big plug in
architecture. The plugin architecture can

265
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.170
take plugins written in any
language. And so we tend

266
00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:09.420
to write, if we can
write a new feature by

267
00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:11.460
making it a plugin, we
will do that. And then

268
00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:12.810
we'll be able to use
C-sharp, we'll get all the

269
00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:15.360
benefits of all those of
all the, of all those

270
00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:16.890
tools. I think somebody has
written a couple of examples

271
00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:19.860
in iron Python to actually
a plugin setup. So before

272
00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:22.890
you were, you had dot
ASP X, can we get

273
00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:26.940
dot ASP files? Yeah. And
I know how that entry

274
00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:30.060
point into IIS works and
how you get ahold of

275
00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:31.770
the request, obviously the response
and all that kind of

276
00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:34.860
stuff. Yep. Now, are you
an HTP handler? I mean,

277
00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:37.290
who, how do you get
into, what's your relationship with

278
00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:42.090
AIS? I'm pretty sure don't
know. Okay. Sorry. So there's

279
00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:44.310
some, but you're, you're a
full class done at language.

280
00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:46.500
So the USB in there
with, Yeah, I think it's

281
00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:48.450
still like the kind of
one entry point, like where

282
00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:52.260
you just have one big,
gigantic monolithic blob of code

283
00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.540
that runs in a bunch
of classes. I think it's

284
00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:57.030
kind of the same. Now,
when did punk books start?

285
00:13:57.930 --> 00:14:00.900
We've been shipping five books
since November, 2000, 2000. Wow. So

286
00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:02.670
you're yeah. You're with the
10 years thing coming up

287
00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:05.250
pretty soon here. And when
did you start Joel on

288
00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:08.850
software doc? A little bit
before that. 1999. I think

289
00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:11.130
I had an, an article
and mostly in the summer

290
00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:13.890
of 2000 before I started
fuckery. And when did people

291
00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:19.890
find value in it? Never.
Exactly. Yeah. I was, I

292
00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:22.770
was giving a talk at
a, at discovery just a

293
00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:25.230
little while ago here. And
as one of, one of

294
00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:26.940
the people said, well, why
bother writing a blog? And

295
00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:28.320
I said, well, you know,
cause we can go back

296
00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:31.290
and Google myself later. And
you know, I just went

297
00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:34.560
back to September of 2002
when I started it and

298
00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:36.680
looked at the first post
while we were there on,

299
00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:38.910
on stage. And it said,
well, it looks like I'm

300
00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:43.440
blogging. We'll see how long
this lasts. That's everybody's first

301
00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:47.940
and most people's last post.
Yeah. You know, a lot

302
00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:50.910
of people blog. It's interesting
to see some of the,

303
00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:54.530
some of the classic bloggers,
the, the shape, their blogs

304
00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:56.690
take, make it clear why
they're blogging. So for example,

305
00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:59.090
Dave Winer, every once in
a while, we'll have a

306
00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:01.100
post where he says, it's
not gonna be interesting to

307
00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:03.050
anybody I'm just posting this
so that I can find

308
00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:05.480
it in the future. And
at some point there was

309
00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:10.310
a point in, I would
say 2001, 2002, when Google

310
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:13.700
got so good at finding
things that everybody started to

311
00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:17.060
learn that stuff on the
internet could be found. Whereas

312
00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:19.130
they used to have an
assumption that it could. So

313
00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:22.100
for example, until then everybody
had 4,000 bookmarks because they

314
00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:24.080
wanted to be able to
get back to the Microsoft

315
00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:25.850
homepage again, because they didn't
know how and they had

316
00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:28.520
to make a bookmark to
the Microsoft homepage so they

317
00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:32.140
could find it on their
own site. Yeah. Everyone's on

318
00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:35.230
site became their homepage, right.
Their bookmarks, which was actually

319
00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:37.120
the bookmarks in net and
the original version of Netscape,

320
00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:39.490
the bookmarks was an HTML
file. Actually, you could make

321
00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:43.750
that your homepage. And, but
as soon as people discovered

322
00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:45.640
that you could trust Google
to find things for you.

323
00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:48.550
Again, they started putting stuff
out there simply so that

324
00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:51.040
they could find it again.
And so a lot of

325
00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:53.170
programmers, that's what their blogs
are. Just a lot of,

326
00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:55.360
kind of nominate any dis
again. And there's definitely posts

327
00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:59.370
like that, of that form
on, on, and software. There

328
00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:00.680
are other, there are other
kinds of bloggers I think

329
00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:03.550
are like Raymond Chan is a
great example was one of,

330
00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:06.160
besides the fact that, you
know, he just has brilliant

331
00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.110
and interesting things to say.
And almost everything he posts

332
00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:12.700
is sort of fun and
interesting, but that his titles

333
00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:15.580
are almost always questions. And
his post is an answer

334
00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:18.250
to that question. And you
can tell that from the

335
00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:20.980
beginning, he was conscientious that
what he wanted to do

336
00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:23.200
is be the canonical answer
to a question for a

337
00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:26.260
particular narrow niche question about
the wind 32 API that

338
00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.240
he happened to know the
answer to, You know, in

339
00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:30.100
the, in the, in the
talk I gave on social

340
00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:32.920
networking today, I said that,
you know, you'll start blogging.

341
00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:35.200
And you know, I said,
everyone here should have a

342
00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:37.180
blog. And some people said,
yes, I will. I will.

343
00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:38.620
I dedicate myself. I will
get a blog. And I

344
00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:40.540
said, all right, well, you're
going to blog in a

345
00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:42.940
vacuum for a year and
no one is going to

346
00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:45.310
read anything that you've ever
written and no one's going

347
00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:47.560
to care. And you're going
to feel bad about that.

348
00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:50.880
And then one day you'll
write a post that will

349
00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:53.350
be the post you become
known for. Yeah. And I

350
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:56.410
asked, I asked John Robbins who
was there. I said, you,

351
00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:59.440
John, what is the post
that everyone? And he says

352
00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:03.460
how to install Vista 64
on Mac book pro. Yep.

353
00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:07.030
Right. What Scott, what was
yours? Exactly. Direct question and

354
00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:10.360
direct answer and not in
any way what he was

355
00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:12.400
interested in blogging about. Yeah.
But he just happened to

356
00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:15.880
answer a question. Then his
post became the kind of

357
00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:19.270
canonical answer to something. Right.
And for me it was

358
00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:21.700
a tools list that I
wrote. It was Scott's ultimate

359
00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:24.190
tools list. Oh, cool, cool.
And that just became like

360
00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:26.560
the thing. So everyone, every
year everyone wants, and actually

361
00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:28.570
now this is the first
year that I've skipped a

362
00:17:28.570 --> 00:17:30.160
year. I didn't do it
last year. And now I'm

363
00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:34.930
getting complaints. Right. Where's this
year's list. Yeah. Mine is

364
00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:37.390
probably that article about Unicode.
Although I had a readers

365
00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:42.010
before that, but still probably
the number one post on

366
00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:43.720
my site in terms of
getting traffic, is that little

367
00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:46.330
tutorial about Unicode that yeah.
And it had kind of

368
00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:48.220
a, what we would call
today kind of a classic

369
00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:53.160
link title because it was
so declarative what every developer

370
00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:57.420
absolutely needs to know at
the absolute minimum, no excuses.

371
00:17:57.450 --> 00:18:00.030
Right. I mean, it almost
does the title just calls

372
00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:02.880
you an idiot and begs
you to read it. And

373
00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:04.500
it was a great, it
was a great post. And

374
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.810
that is to this day,
that kind of the canonical.

375
00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:10.170
Right. Were you worried that
it wasn't correct? Did it,

376
00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:11.580
were there any ideas in
it? I was pretty sure

377
00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:13.820
it was reasonably correct. Yeah.
What I was worried about

378
00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:15.290
at the time I was
writing it is that there

379
00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:18.830
were 9 million other issues in
internationalization. And the people that

380
00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:22.520
tend to be concerned about
internationalization, nationalization, localization, et cetera,

381
00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:26.990
all tend to be monumentally
nitpicky. And I thought that

382
00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:28.670
I would start to get
long letters about how I

383
00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:30.860
hadn't said anything about how,
when you translate the German,

384
00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:32.990
all the dialogue boxes you'll
have to, all the words

385
00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:34.960
will get longer and you'll
need to leave space for,

386
00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:36.680
and I didn't say anything
about that. And I didn't

387
00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:39.290
talk about month date or,
Well, it wasn't the, it

388
00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:41.270
wasn't supposed to be, None
of it was about character

389
00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:43.550
sets. Exactly. And it was
the thing that was what

390
00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:47.420
was interesting is that so
many people that to this

391
00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:49.760
day don't know that don't
know that stuff. And I

392
00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:51.530
read a book by Michael
Caplin who now works at

393
00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:53.990
Microsoft Kaplan. Yeah. Great guy.
He has a really great

394
00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:56.570
blog called sorting it out.
Right. Also a lot of

395
00:18:56.570 --> 00:19:00.770
stuff about character, character sets
and localization, especially around character

396
00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:03.890
sets. And he wrote a
book called international. I think

397
00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:06.770
it was called internationalization with
visual basic that I actually

398
00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:08.930
use to try to get
an early version of city

399
00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:12.980
desk working with some reasonable
unit level support. And that's

400
00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:15.080
how I kind of learned
this stuff because he just

401
00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:17.010
finally, you know, he explained
it in a way that

402
00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:18.890
made sense to me because
for the first time nobody

403
00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:21.260
had ever tried to do
that before. And was that

404
00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:23.840
when that post happened, was
that when kind of what

405
00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:28.700
Chris cells called called obscurely
famous began now? I think

406
00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:30.290
Sort of, I mean, there
are a lot of other

407
00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:32.810
posts that I've written on
doll and software that have

408
00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:35.090
gotten linked to, by the
people that reach on software.

409
00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:39.260
And I, there, there was
nothing special about that post

410
00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:41.360
in terms of the traffic
that generated the, probably the

411
00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.250
turning point, the point that
generate the, the post that

412
00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:46.400
generated the most traffic was
how Microsoft lost the API

413
00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:49.430
war, which got, you know,
a monumental amount of attention,

414
00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:52.850
including a lot of internal
attention at Microsoft. And, you

415
00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:55.310
know, I had been told
that it was, you know,

416
00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:58.550
I think that was the
Longhorn reset, reset just a

417
00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:02.660
couple of years ago. Yeah.
Was basically in some, in

418
00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:04.670
some way inspired by some
of the things that I

419
00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:08.810
mentioned there. And, you know,
I don't want to take

420
00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:11.540
credit for that that's way.
That's called part. But there

421
00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:14.030
were conversations inside Microsoft that
were instigated by this, how

422
00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:16.910
Microsoft lost the API work.
Do you know how to

423
00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:19.970
make the possible out of
the impossible? Well, the dotnet

424
00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:22.790
ninjas at Telerik do they
just released a huge pack

425
00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:25.040
of web controls, all built
on top of ASP at

426
00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:29.270
Ajax, that'll help you build
impossibly fast and interactive applications

427
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:32.630
in no time at all.
They've made the impossible possible

428
00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:35.690
in desktop development. If you
think you can't have a

429
00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:39.050
carousel component and wind forms,
well you can. They're windows

430
00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:41.990
forms, suite features a super
powerful grid view control on

431
00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:44.300
32 other crazy desktop components
that will give you a

432
00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:49.120
dazzling WPF like features, but
in wind forms, they do

433
00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:51.190
the same thing in reporting
solutions with a new design

434
00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:54.160
surface, like nothing else looks
just like graph paper, cause

435
00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:57.880
you advanced page layout capabilities
makes it feel more like

436
00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:00.850
a graphic design software than
a reporting solution. Go check

437
00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:04.060
them out@telerik.com and be a
dotnet Ninja. And thanks for

438
00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:07.450
listening. It's amazing how bloggers
can affect things inside of

439
00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:10.270
Microsoft. A really great blogger
that I really enjoy, but

440
00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:12.040
I don't think enough people
read is a guy named

441
00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:15.160
long Jang is a guy
out of Australia and he

442
00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:18.100
has a blog called I
started something and it is

443
00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:21.790
just such a thoughtfully written
blog. And he doesn't just

444
00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:24.010
complain, which a lot of
bloggers do, but he also

445
00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:27.940
takes action. Right? So for
example, he doesn't like UI

446
00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:32.080
inconsistency. So rather than complaining
about it and he actually

447
00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:35.200
made a website, that's a
community site that does nothing

448
00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:39.610
but collect screenshots of dialogues
with inconsistencies so that people

449
00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:42.550
can document and then upload
or download them. It's the

450
00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:44.680
stack. This was done a
couple of years ago, but

451
00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:48.040
it's kind of the stack
overflow for one thing. UI

452
00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:51.070
inconsistency. Yep. Yep. He's got
one for windows seven. Cool.

453
00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:53.800
One for Vista and one
for Macko ESCA was really

454
00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:56.740
bad. Yeah. And that took
a lot of attention internally.

455
00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:59.260
Microsoft people were like, Oh
wow, look at this. A

456
00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:01.900
screenshot, nice bug report. I
mean, it was, you know,

457
00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:05.920
bug tracking for that kind
of stuff. I think that

458
00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:09.640
I don't enjoy reading complainer
blogs as much as I

459
00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:12.570
know, Because if you're just,
if you're just complaining, then

460
00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:15.150
it's like, yeah, I know
cell phone companies suck. I'm

461
00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:16.650
sorry. You had a bad
experience with a cell phone

462
00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:19.020
company, but am I really
going to continue to read

463
00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:21.030
these until the end of
time? And it's every, and

464
00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:23.910
if everybody's going to have
a blog, are we all

465
00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:25.680
gonna write the same post
about the bad thing that

466
00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:29.040
at and T did you,
you know, at T at

467
00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:32.190
some point that's not necessarily
the most productive, so how

468
00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:34.800
much are you blogging once
a week or no, not

469
00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:37.410
even. I, I hardly ever
have time to blog anymore.

470
00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:39.180
And I, and I've also
kind of run out of

471
00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:41.070
things to say, because a
lot of what I was

472
00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:43.440
writing in the early days
was, you know, accumulated knowledge

473
00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:46.500
of a couple of decades
of working in software. And

474
00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:48.600
once I had gotten the
main points out that I

475
00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:51.120
wanted to get out, you
know, I don't, I'm not

476
00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:53.520
gonna, I guess I have
a, I try to maintain

477
00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:56.010
the same level of filter
that I always had if

478
00:22:56.010 --> 00:23:00.180
a post is not, you
know, if it's not, you

479
00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:01.950
know, relatively novel. And I
feel like I have a

480
00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:04.980
kind of an interesting thing
on it and people seem

481
00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:07.200
to be missing the point.
Yeah, I won't read it.

482
00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:09.660
And one thing that has
happened is there's so many

483
00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:12.060
other good bloggers out there
now that I don't have

484
00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:14.700
to be the one to
write those posts Terminating though.

485
00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:18.330
I must say like Jeff
Atwood has a, there's a

486
00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:21.900
cadence to his blogging just
once a day. And even

487
00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:24.360
though sometimes I'll go, come
on, Jeff. It was Tuesday.

488
00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:26.160
That was a crappy post.
You just threw the, you

489
00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:28.290
just threw that one away.
It's just that every, every

490
00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:30.960
weekday there's a good post
from, from Jeff. Now, a

491
00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:34.290
number of years ago, he
posted that you had jumped

492
00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:38.430
the shark. That's probably still
one of the top Google

493
00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:40.920
hits. Yeah. For those of
us who are not necessarily

494
00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:43.140
from the U S or
listening to this podcast or

495
00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:47.570
who may not speak English
to jump, the shark is

496
00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:50.960
actually a reference to an
episode of the American sitcom.

497
00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:55.040
Happy days when somewhere in
the fourth or fifth season,

498
00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:57.440
they decided to set up
a very silly spectacle where

499
00:23:58.190 --> 00:24:00.710
the Fonz would jump a
shark on a pair of

500
00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:05.360
jet skis. Right. And it
was a ridiculous, silly stunt

501
00:24:06.010 --> 00:24:08.320
To try to get viewers
and in a fading fading

502
00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:10.600
In a fading television show.
So then to jump, the

503
00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:13.270
shark became the Mark of
when something that you once

504
00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:16.870
loved, has finally peaked and
is now heading downhill. Right?

505
00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:20.080
So Jeff said in a
very public post dedicated to

506
00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:23.050
Joel Spolsky, it's jumped the
shark. We once loved him.

507
00:24:23.050 --> 00:24:26.020
And now it's over. Let
us all watch the him

508
00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:29.980
go down in flames. Okay.
Now you guys are like

509
00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:32.320
hanging out all in together.
You got a podcast you're

510
00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:33.730
going to record in an
hour and you're in a

511
00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:37.630
business venture. How do, if
I insult you in a,

512
00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:41.320
can we hang out more
Blog, mean thing, hang out

513
00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:43.600
with you. Whether or not
you, but, but go ahead.

514
00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:46.600
How in the world did
that turn into a process?

515
00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:51.670
Well, actually I didn't know
about that post. I had

516
00:24:51.670 --> 00:24:55.480
already signed on when she
was assaulted. Now I'm not

517
00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:59.980
really insulted by, by like
thoughtless meaningless nonsense. Like now

518
00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:04.330
You didn't know about that.
It wasn't like on your

519
00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:06.220
radar. I didn't know about,
I didn't know about that.

520
00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:09.310
I thought that Jeff, Jeff
was a, a good blogger

521
00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:12.550
and an important blogger and
self that's kind of more

522
00:25:12.550 --> 00:25:13.720
important to me than the
fact that he had been

523
00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:15.850
to insult me once He
did the same thing to

524
00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:18.930
Paul Graham and now they hang
out. Oh really? Yeah. Yeah.

525
00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:20.890
She said, you look, go
search for his blog for

526
00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:23.830
Paul Graham. And he went on
about how he sucks and

527
00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:26.350
now Jeff and Paul talk.
So I think it's a

528
00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:28.300
great way to meet famous
people. I think it's kind

529
00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:30.190
of actually important if you're
a blogger, I might want

530
00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:33.120
to tell people is that
as an early blogger, you're

531
00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:36.010
one way which you can
gain fame is by trying

532
00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:39.490
to take down people who
were more mighty than you.

533
00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:41.350
So I can write it.
I can write a post

534
00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:43.870
saying how Microsoft lost the
API war because Microsoft is

535
00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:46.270
mightier than I am. And
you know, I can do

536
00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:48.220
that. On the other hand,
now that I've got fog

537
00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:50.350
Creek software, we have 25
employees. We're making millions of

538
00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:52.360
dollars a year where highly
profitable. We have this big,

539
00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:54.850
beautiful office. And I have
a blog that's read by

540
00:25:54.850 --> 00:25:57.790
a million people for me
to attack some blogger say

541
00:25:57.790 --> 00:26:00.640
that only has 200,000 readers
instead of a million readers

542
00:26:00.910 --> 00:26:05.650
would be cool. It would
just be, and w whatever,

543
00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:08.740
whatever point you are in
the scale, it's, you're, you're

544
00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:11.350
allowed to poke at the
people that are above you,

545
00:26:11.710 --> 00:26:13.900
but it's not very nice.
It's just not polite, really

546
00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:15.640
to attack the people that
are weaker and smaller than

547
00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:18.340
you. It's just, it's just
not basic manners. I think

548
00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:21.850
in some, in some, in
some extent. And so, whereas

549
00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:23.680
I used to get a
lot of joy out of

550
00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:25.570
writing a blog, post, making
fun of some startup with

551
00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:28.600
a ridiculously idiotic idea, because
nobody knew who I was

552
00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:31.990
and it was ridiculous. And
now I sort of feel

553
00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:33.640
bad. I'm not going to
attack two guys working on

554
00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:35.770
a little Y Combinator startup
that have a ridiculous, stupid

555
00:26:35.770 --> 00:26:37.960
idea. They don't, they don't
need to be attacked by

556
00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:39.580
me. And it's just not,
that's just like beating up

557
00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:41.830
little kids in the playground.
So speaking of two, two

558
00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:44.520
guys working on a ridiculous
with a stupid idea. Yeah.

559
00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:50.130
Stack overflow. Yeah, exactly. Poor
guys. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So,

560
00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:53.160
so you and Jeff were
partners in this stack overflow

561
00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:56.010
thing, and it's, it's, it's
like a rocket. I went

562
00:26:56.010 --> 00:26:59.810
on compete.com and the traffic
is looking great. Yeah. Their

563
00:26:59.810 --> 00:27:02.420
numbers are terrible. We don't,
we don't hesitate to publicize

564
00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:05.210
their numbers, but they're substantially
higher than what compete.com shows

565
00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:07.520
by orders of magnitude. Oh,
really? Yeah. So compete is

566
00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:12.680
wrong. I said like 14 million
page views last month. Yeah.

567
00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:14.750
That's our number. That's not
compete number. Oh, I thought

568
00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:17.750
competes it. Oh, okay. Yeah.
I don't know how there's

569
00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:20.300
all these different things like
compete Netcraft and Alexa, everybody

570
00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:22.370
wants to know what the
hot numbers are. They're all

571
00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:24.800
wrong. And they're all using
internet Explorer, plugins that no

572
00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:27.920
programmer has. So that explains
why they would be so

573
00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:32.120
low. Right? The current numbers
are about, let's see, 14 million

574
00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:37.640
pages a month, 6 million visitors
a month, 3 million unique visitors

575
00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:43.490
a month. That's pretty much
So 3 million unique individual human

576
00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:46.310
beings. Well, you know, the
way you Nix is defined

577
00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:48.170
is we try to set
a cookie. And if the

578
00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:50.260
cookie is still there, we
continue to be, you do

579
00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:52.370
some people clear their cookies.
That's a lot of people.

580
00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:54.590
Yeah. And the thing, I
think that is a lot,

581
00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:57.470
especially The best estimates I've
heard of how many programmers

582
00:27:57.470 --> 00:28:02.510
there are, are two to
4 million. So Two to 4 million

583
00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:07.190
programmers. No nonsense. I think
you're insane. No, I would

584
00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:09.020
totally disagree with that. That's
a really interesting question. We

585
00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:11.510
should have some audience participation.
If we had an audience,

586
00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:15.680
there is a, there are
probably 3 million C sharp developers

587
00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:19.730
alone in the world. I
know for, like, for example,

588
00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:23.360
in Norway, how many, how
many programmers, what percentage Programmers

589
00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:25.400
do you think on the
United States? Cause there is us

590
00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:27.830
department of labor. It's a
good question. Let me, let

591
00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:29.420
me put it this way
in Norway. There's like what?

592
00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:32.360
How many people in Norway?
6 million people. Yeah. Someone told

593
00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:37.730
me that in Norway, there
are 30 thousand.net developers. Okay.

594
00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:39.960
Well we can extrapolate. We
can extract from Norway. We

595
00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:43.190
very smart in Norway. Here's
where I get that. The

596
00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:45.980
department of labor. Okay. Can
I Google this now? Or

597
00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:48.320
is it Okay? He's going
to Google now and I'm

598
00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:50.090
going to talk while he
Googled. So he's going over

599
00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:52.310
to Google now. He's not
using stack overflow to answer

600
00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:54.980
this question. You know what?
It will, it'll come up

601
00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:56.630
with a stack overflow. We'll
be like, Oh, really? He's

602
00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:59.270
going to be in the
first page. So yeah. Let

603
00:28:59.270 --> 00:29:02.060
me think. He says 3 million
programmers in the entire world.

604
00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:05.270
I think it's more like
30 or 40 million. That's a

605
00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:09.770
lot. How many, let's say
just type, how many programmers

606
00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:12.500
in the world are there
in the world. This is

607
00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:14.630
actually going to be kind
of illustrative. So Google answers.

608
00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:16.850
How many programmers are there?
Yeah. Google answers. That's okay.

609
00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:20.030
No answer. Okay. Okay. What's
the next one. How many

610
00:29:20.030 --> 00:29:22.340
programs? And this is like,
there are 6 billion people in

611
00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:24.740
the world, Right? And this
was just about the same

612
00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:27.050
as trying to figure out
how many aliens there are

613
00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:28.880
in the universe, because you
just have to go in

614
00:29:29.390 --> 00:29:32.210
and guess how many grains?
Here's the stack overflow it

615
00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:33.950
way into. So stack overflow
shows up and what do

616
00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:37.370
we say? Well, they're also,
this guy is guessing 12 million,

617
00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:40.640
but he's saying 1% of
people with computers or something,

618
00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:42.880
that's kind ridiculous. Well, that's
interesting Though. 1% of people

619
00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:47.220
with computers. Well, here's the
U S government 3.1 Americans

620
00:29:47.250 --> 00:29:50.100
3.1 million Americans. Okay, here
we go. So that's a

621
00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:52.140
real statistic now, the quick,
now the next thing, which

622
00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:55.470
we might have a statistic.
Oh, well what percentage of

623
00:29:55.830 --> 00:30:00.960
Microsoft developer product tools? Revenue
comes from outside the United States.

624
00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:05.100
Yeah, I'm betting. It's about
50. 50. Okay. Right. So

625
00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:09.240
there's 300 million, say 600 million Americans,
kids counting old people and

626
00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:13.920
babies. 3 million, 3 million of them.
No. 300 million Americans. Yeah. There

627
00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:17.010
was no babies or old
people that program. And with

628
00:30:17.010 --> 00:30:20.160
3 million of them, 1% of
Americans are programmers. Okay. So

629
00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:24.360
then you figure, you can't
say 6 billion because not everyone's

630
00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:27.150
doing this kind of stuff.
There's no way that 1%.

631
00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:31.230
So 1.1% of computer users
and say, now I want

632
00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:34.440
to just say it's like
60 million people. No, I don't

633
00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:36.570
believe so, because I think
that America has more programmers

634
00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:39.180
per capita then. Yeah. Oh,
I bet you, if you

635
00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:40.650
took the G what you
should do is take the

636
00:30:40.650 --> 00:30:45.060
G 20. Okay. Right. 1%
of the total population of

637
00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:48.480
the <inaudible>. I I'm going
to go buy almost all

638
00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:51.960
software companies tend to report
that 40 to 50% of

639
00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:54.330
their sales in the United States.
And these are, and everyone

640
00:30:54.330 --> 00:30:58.170
else's outside. Yeah. Okay. So
basically that times two. Yeah.

641
00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:01.230
That's why I think it's
that time. 6 million programmers. I

642
00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:03.390
don't know. And you're getting
a chunk of them half.

643
00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:06.530
Yeah. I think that's a
little, Yeah, it's probably higher.

644
00:31:06.690 --> 00:31:08.940
Well, we'll see how high
it goes When you have,

645
00:31:09.450 --> 00:31:10.930
when you have a lot,
you know, if you double

646
00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:12.330
talk to me in four
months and if you have

647
00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:15.070
them all, then that'd be
great. I think really the

648
00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:17.310
way that, you know, when
I mean, you, I mean,

649
00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:20.850
anyone knows is when you
can just mention it to

650
00:31:20.850 --> 00:31:23.100
anybody and think, Oh yeah,
yeah, right. Yeah. I mean,

651
00:31:23.550 --> 00:31:26.640
I mentioned stack overflow today
and about, I don't know,

652
00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:29.850
30, 40% of the audience
raised their hands. That's it?

653
00:31:29.910 --> 00:31:31.620
That's about what we're seeing.
That's what we, that's what

654
00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:33.450
happened in the mix. Right.
Do you mean that they're

655
00:31:33.450 --> 00:31:35.490
active users, but it means
it's starting to get in

656
00:31:35.490 --> 00:31:37.770
their consciousness. They're starting to
use it. They're starting to

657
00:31:37.770 --> 00:31:39.780
think about it. Most people
We'll discover it. Cause they'll,

658
00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:41.790
it'll start to come up
in Google search results and

659
00:31:41.790 --> 00:31:43.110
they won't even look at
the name of the site

660
00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:45.840
until about the third time
they've seen stack overflow and

661
00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:48.360
they start realizing they're getting
better answers from stack overflow.

662
00:31:48.570 --> 00:31:51.720
And so they're doing the
Google thing of reaching over

663
00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:54.840
three other sites to pick
the fourth result, See the

664
00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:56.970
stack overflow site. Yeah. They
want that one. Yeah. And

665
00:31:56.970 --> 00:31:59.520
actually Google detects that and
starts to it. Doesn't really,

666
00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:01.650
yeah. They start to twiddle,
they'll twiddle what's on the

667
00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:04.920
homepage based on if they
discover people reaching over another

668
00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:07.050
site. Oh yeah. And I've
noticed that I get different

669
00:32:07.050 --> 00:32:09.390
results in Google, whether I'm
signed in or not. Right.

670
00:32:09.450 --> 00:32:11.460
So they know what I
prefer to look at. All

671
00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:12.990
right. Well that was a
big ego trip right there.

672
00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:16.440
But the point is that
you're starting to answer questions

673
00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:20.340
that people want to get
answered. And it's kind of

674
00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:23.400
showing that the full tech
search indexing is just not

675
00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:24.960
the best way to get
the answer to a question

676
00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:28.560
There. Yeah. There there's, there's
a, there's a general weakness

677
00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:31.920
with search engines that comes
around in these sort of

678
00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:35.790
Q and a experts, answering
questions, kind of areas. The

679
00:32:35.790 --> 00:32:37.620
reason that they've been pretty
weak, this sort of my

680
00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:40.340
guest is, well, there's a
couple of things, but the,

681
00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:44.600
the main point is that
these programming questions are very,

682
00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:48.710
very narrow. So a question
on stack overflow, that's popular.

683
00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:52.310
We'll have a thousand people
look at it. Okay. So

684
00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:53.660
it's two nights. It was
a little bit of a

685
00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:56.440
low. Yeah. I mean, I
expect, I asked a question

686
00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:59.260
and I figured just in
like peripheral kind of like

687
00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:01.780
collateral people looking at it,
I get a couple of

688
00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:03.970
thousand, but it's really just
a few hundred for very,

689
00:33:03.970 --> 00:33:06.520
very narrow, narrow questions And
you'll get your answers and

690
00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:07.960
they'll be voted up and
the right ones will be

691
00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:09.640
voted up and you'll get
a lot of people to

692
00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:12.100
get the right people. An
aggregate number is way smaller

693
00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:14.350
than you would think, given
the quality of the ads.

694
00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:16.000
Right. So now how many
people are going to go

695
00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.090
make a link to your
stack overflow question one, right.

696
00:33:19.630 --> 00:33:21.400
And it'll be from Twitter.
So it'll be going through

697
00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:25.330
one or two. Right. So
shortening is a huge problem.

698
00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:30.550
So PageRank does not work
for these such narrow topics.

699
00:33:31.450 --> 00:33:33.670
Authority doesn't work because authority
is like, well, is the

700
00:33:33.670 --> 00:33:36.160
site authoritative, Just to make
sure that the audience understands

701
00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:37.990
when he's saying page rank
does not work, is that

702
00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:42.100
Google is fundamentally built on
the idea that people will

703
00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:45.220
like your stuff and link
to it. Right. And what

704
00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:47.980
he's saying is that an
answer, a question is asked,

705
00:33:48.430 --> 00:33:49.990
how do I get it
out of the extra well,

706
00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:52.930
serializer. Yeah. And the answer
comes down, you do it

707
00:33:52.930 --> 00:33:56.320
like this, and it's correct.
And it's perfect, but no

708
00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:58.780
one ever links to it.
Right. So Google has no

709
00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:00.940
way of knowing that that's
the best answer. Exactly. Right.

710
00:34:01.330 --> 00:34:02.800
And so this is the
first problem. The second problem

711
00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:04.210
is, think of all the
different ways you could phrase

712
00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:08.380
that question. And so whatever
incoming traffic there might be

713
00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:12.310
from the search engines to
this question gets fragmented across

714
00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:15.370
a much larger spectrum of
possible ways of phrasing this

715
00:34:15.370 --> 00:34:17.980
question. Interesting. That that issue
of phrasing the question is

716
00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:19.630
where I think, I mean,
and I think everyone in

717
00:34:19.630 --> 00:34:22.060
the audience here will understand
the audience. We were talking,

718
00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:25.120
I'm gesturing towards the empty
cafeteria to my right. Everyone

719
00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:27.370
in the audience, that guy
over there who's getting tea

720
00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:32.260
knows that they are probably
just by virtue of the

721
00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:34.660
fact that they're listening to
this show, the guy who

722
00:34:34.660 --> 00:34:38.080
can Google best or gal
who can Google best. And

723
00:34:38.140 --> 00:34:40.090
we all have that situation
where a friend says, man,

724
00:34:40.090 --> 00:34:42.310
I've Googled my brains out.
I've been Googling for an

725
00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:44.890
hour. Help me get the
answer to this. And I

726
00:34:44.890 --> 00:34:47.230
look for it and it's
like the first hit. And

727
00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:49.360
then, Oh, you're the Google
master baby. You're the Google

728
00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:52.000
master. No. I just know
how to phrase things sufficiently

729
00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.210
vague. Yup. That Google, you
know, I get like if

730
00:34:55.210 --> 00:34:57.400
I pick the right two
words, Right. Two keywords that

731
00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:59.170
you know are going to
be in the answer, That's

732
00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:02.800
a huge problem. Yep. Cause
I don't know what is

733
00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:05.890
causing me to answer the
right thing. They're entire classes

734
00:35:05.890 --> 00:35:08.230
of things that cause problems
for a Google on searching

735
00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:12.550
for specifically programmer related questions.
One, one great one is

736
00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:15.220
let's say that you're searching
for a question related to

737
00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:19.180
VB six, as opposed to
vb.net, just as a typical

738
00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:22.570
example and you're screwed, you're
screwed and anything new. And

739
00:35:22.570 --> 00:35:25.660
you're screwed for example, a
big common complaint today these

740
00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:27.670
days. And it'll eventually it'll
it'll work itself out of

741
00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:30.190
the system. But right now,
if you search for asp.net,

742
00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:33.010
MVC things on Google, that
you wind up getting a

743
00:35:33.010 --> 00:35:35.710
lot of stuff about early
betas that are either no

744
00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:38.130
longer true or no, aren't
correct. It's not changed. And

745
00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:39.450
We were trying to put
a lot of really good

746
00:35:39.450 --> 00:35:42.630
information out really fast to
make people feel good. And

747
00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:44.820
now they're finding all sorts
of code that doesn't compile.

748
00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:48.140
Right? Right. And not only
that, that stuff, because there's

749
00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:50.060
no page rank because Google
can't look at Patrion cause

750
00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:52.460
there's not enough people linking
to these things. It looks

751
00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:54.830
at authority and it uses
other measures of authority. Like

752
00:35:54.830 --> 00:35:57.470
the older, the link, the
more authoritative it is because

753
00:35:57.470 --> 00:35:59.990
Google will generally prefer a
LinkedIn hangs around for a

754
00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:02.750
long time, rather than something
a femoral. And that means

755
00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:06.590
that, that it is actually
a constitutional problem of search

756
00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:10.580
engines. That if something is
wrong is out there, it's

757
00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:12.770
going to continue to, to
be pointed to by the

758
00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:14.780
search engines. So that's why
we knew that stack over.

759
00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:16.280
When we designed stack overflow,
we said, first of all,

760
00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:18.740
it has to have voting
because we got to have

761
00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:21.890
10 experts on the subject,
get together and just decide

762
00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:24.590
what's important. And that's that
they have to use that

763
00:36:24.590 --> 00:36:26.990
gesture rather than the gesture
of making a writer from

764
00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:31.010
their blog. Because that's the
only way to This helps

765
00:36:31.010 --> 00:36:34.490
you prioritize your search. But
how do you tell Google?

766
00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:38.480
Here's the thing when we
have we're prioritizing the answer.

767
00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:40.730
So as long as Google
finds us as the question

768
00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:44.000
and stack overflow has authority
because programmers around the world

769
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.040
linked to it and their
blogs to, to this top

770
00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:49.400
level domain, right then at
least stack overflow will have

771
00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:52.040
a high page rank. And
our version of the question

772
00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:55.310
will be bumped above. Let's
say an old use net

773
00:36:55.310 --> 00:36:57.680
version of that question. And
if that happens, once you

774
00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:59.990
get into our question, now
there are two reasons why

775
00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:01.460
our answers are going to
be better. One is that

776
00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:04.190
the answers are constantly going
to be resorted and voted

777
00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:06.140
upon. So whatever is the
best answer will be at

778
00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:07.520
the top. You don't have
to search through all the

779
00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:09.620
answers, right? You at least
have a place to look

780
00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:12.650
to find what the best
answer is that the consensus

781
00:37:12.650 --> 00:37:14.360
of the people that have
looked at this narrow questions,

782
00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:16.490
a hundred people that have
participated in this narrow question.

783
00:37:16.730 --> 00:37:19.430
And secondly, it's a Wiki.
So if it is wrong

784
00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:20.630
or if it is out
of date or it is

785
00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:22.850
obsolete, somebody is going to
hit the edit button and

786
00:37:22.850 --> 00:37:26.240
fix it, make that code
compile. And so these old

787
00:37:26.270 --> 00:37:30.140
established stack overflow topics that
have lots of Google karma

788
00:37:30.170 --> 00:37:32.690
can continue to come up.
Number one in the search

789
00:37:32.690 --> 00:37:36.950
results. And yet they can
change as the technology changes.

790
00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:39.890
One great example is, think
about how many times you've

791
00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:42.230
seen an answer to a
question that has come up,

792
00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:45.260
you know, when you're searching
for a programming question and

793
00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:48.500
it's got, you know, across
site scripting vulnerability in the

794
00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:51.470
answer, or it's a gigantic
SQL injection problem, it should

795
00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:53.990
not exist. It's going to
cause somebody to cut and

796
00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:55.970
paste code. That's going to
be a security problem. Right?

797
00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:57.980
You can't do anything about
it. There's no edit edit

798
00:37:57.980 --> 00:37:59.720
button on most of these
sites. And on stack overflow,

799
00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:03.170
you'd hit the edit button
and say warning, Cossacks, scripting

800
00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:06.200
butter, a felony, or do
not actually run this code

801
00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:09.500
because you're just concatenating together
a SQL string with, I

802
00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:12.710
think probably about half of
the books that have been

803
00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:16.760
published about web programming, concatenate
strings, that they then pass

804
00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:19.670
off to a SQL server
and you know, strings coming

805
00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:21.300
from there. Yeah. I actually
had a, I had a

806
00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:24.590
buddy of mine is working
on some analysis software that

807
00:38:24.590 --> 00:38:26.180
looks at logs and he
found that there was a

808
00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:29.540
botnet that keeps attacking my
blog. And it's like, it's

809
00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:32.420
like the same three or
400 IP addresses doing the

810
00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:34.310
same three or four things
where they try to drop

811
00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:37.810
tables right off the end
of My blog. Just for

812
00:38:37.810 --> 00:38:41.550
fun. Yeah. Just for fun.
So this thing about, about

813
00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:44.100
where Google is grabbing and
where any, I guess I

814
00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:45.960
would say Google, I mean
any generic search engine is,

815
00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:50.160
is getting their data. PageRank
doesn't work anymore with Twitter.

816
00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:54.210
I am surprised how often
I see stack overflow appear

817
00:38:54.210 --> 00:38:57.810
in a Google result. I
cannot remember the time when

818
00:38:57.810 --> 00:39:00.780
I've ever seen a result
from Twitter show up as

819
00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:03.690
a result of a search.
Even if I was You

820
00:39:03.690 --> 00:39:06.360
definitely can't, that's the reason
why that's the, that's the

821
00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:08.460
only model for Twitter, which
is that Twitter permalinks don't

822
00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:11.400
show up in Google results,
Twitter, unless somebody links to

823
00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:13.890
it from a blog, in
which case it might, but,

824
00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:16.530
but Google can't just search
all Twitter because they don't

825
00:39:16.530 --> 00:39:19.830
have the feed, which is
why they're called the firehose

826
00:39:19.830 --> 00:39:24.270
version of Twitter, which only
is only available to search.twitter.com

827
00:39:24.270 --> 00:39:27.090
or maybe one or two
other. And then of course

828
00:39:27.090 --> 00:39:29.370
we have the Earl shortening
issue, which is if you're

829
00:39:29.370 --> 00:39:31.860
on Twitter, you're trying to
fit everything into a tiny,

830
00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:35.940
tiny, you know, you only
have 140 characters. So then

831
00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:37.830
you're going to go and
use like I S dot

832
00:39:37.830 --> 00:39:41.640
G D. Yep. And then
you, then again, page rank

833
00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:44.970
falls down, right? This seems
like a huge, huge problem.

834
00:39:44.970 --> 00:39:47.490
And I don't know if
Twitter being bought by Google

835
00:39:47.490 --> 00:39:50.550
is just the start of
that. I would assume that

836
00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:52.950
there is somebody at Google
working on it. I mean,

837
00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:54.510
that's not a hard problem
for them, But they've mainly

838
00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:56.190
with the URL shortening means
that they're going to have

839
00:39:56.190 --> 00:39:58.320
to find, you know, the
API is for expansion and

840
00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:01.650
for all of these different
things, follow them around. Yeah.

841
00:40:01.710 --> 00:40:03.150
Not so hard. You don't
think it's a big deal?

842
00:40:03.210 --> 00:40:06.750
No, I'm sure they probably
have already done half of

843
00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:09.960
this. Yeah. I don't have
a lot of confidence at

844
00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:11.760
Google is just, yeah, they
got a smart PhD working

845
00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:13.530
on it. You don't have
a smart PhD. You need

846
00:40:13.530 --> 00:40:15.570
a table. And the first
column is the name of

847
00:40:15.570 --> 00:40:17.970
the, is the domain name
of the URL shortening shortening

848
00:40:17.970 --> 00:40:20.910
service. And the second column
is sorry, three columns. The

849
00:40:20.910 --> 00:40:23.760
second column tells you how
to construct a query to

850
00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:25.980
the URL shortening service. The
third column is a reg

851
00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:28.440
X that tells you how
to get the correct URL

852
00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:32.220
out of the results Or
you just, or you just

853
00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:36.090
visit it and see what
happens. Yeah. Yeah. This is

854
00:40:36.090 --> 00:40:37.230
not, this is the kind
of thing that they will.

855
00:40:37.290 --> 00:40:38.940
I mean, they have to
keep up with all kinds

856
00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:41.100
of things all the time.
We'll slow down a little

857
00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:43.260
bit on the blog search
stuff because there's a lot

858
00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:45.660
of, I mean, I'm finding
that I used to just

859
00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:50.070
search Google and now I
search Google search.twitter.com and stack

860
00:40:50.070 --> 00:40:52.440
overflow when I want the
answer to something. And I'm

861
00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:57.930
also finding that more because
Twitter prioritizes results in terms

862
00:40:57.930 --> 00:41:01.890
of time. Right. I literally
can't find anything that's older

863
00:41:01.890 --> 00:41:03.960
than a couple of days.
And I think Twitter, I

864
00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:05.820
don't even know if that
stuff, People are using it

865
00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:08.730
as a link sharing service
though. Check this out link.

866
00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:11.460
Yeah. It's interesting. The whole
kind of check this out,

867
00:41:11.490 --> 00:41:14.550
but link. Yeah. That's how
email at first it was

868
00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:17.250
like email, right? Hey, check
this out link. And then

869
00:41:17.250 --> 00:41:20.250
it became people who do
throw away blog posts. Right,

870
00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:22.380
right here, check this out.
And then no one uses

871
00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:25.260
delicious. I threw to the
stats and delicious.com, which is

872
00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:28.770
a fantastic social bookmarking service
virtually. No one uses it.

873
00:41:28.770 --> 00:41:32.640
It's very, very small, only
like the most, whatever most

874
00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:36.050
alpha used delicious. And it's
such an extraordinary service. So

875
00:41:36.050 --> 00:41:38.660
then now people are using,
I know there's a, there's

876
00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:41.840
a Microsoft blogger named Elijah
Manor. And all he does

877
00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:46.700
is Twitter links like every
20 minutes or so, Hey,

878
00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:50.180
check this out link. And
then hashtag hashtag hashtag, which

879
00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:52.100
is great if I want
a fire hose of links,

880
00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:54.260
but I want to know
where those, I mean, I

881
00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:57.650
want to find them later
and I can't, cause he'll

882
00:41:57.650 --> 00:42:02.030
give me a keyword or
a short URL. And it

883
00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:03.890
was just a, it's like
a Firefly. I, you know,

884
00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:06.710
it burst and it was
gone. Yeah. You have to.

885
00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:09.500
I actually, I mean, Twitter
gives me a headache. Sometimes

886
00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:11.570
I feel like going to
Twitter is seeing and seeing

887
00:42:11.570 --> 00:42:14.570
like a list of tweets
that people have made, which

888
00:42:14.570 --> 00:42:16.580
are like, check this out
or check that. And sometimes

889
00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:17.900
you can't understand what's going
on and you have to

890
00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:20.360
figure out who is, and
then you have the problem

891
00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:23.960
and you have to reassemble
the conversation yourself. I can't

892
00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:26.330
stand it. Why you make
me stop it, stop it.

893
00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:30.440
You know what? It's just
the downfall of discourse. There's

894
00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:34.040
just a bunch of people's
downfall of discourse. I shall

895
00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:38.840
tweet that right now. My
wife is getting into that

896
00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:40.460
kind of stuff. You can
say, you can put something

897
00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:42.080
on Twitter and you don't
ha you don't even have

898
00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:45.290
room to justify what you
said. It's not even possible

899
00:42:45.290 --> 00:42:47.270
to make an argument on
Twitter. All you can do

900
00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:50.000
is say your final conclusion,
your opinion on the thing

901
00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.030
which has happened. That's so
funny because people are arguing

902
00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:55.490
on Twitter, they're using it
like it's IRC with permanent

903
00:42:55.490 --> 00:42:56.990
link, but they're not. But
yet it's a different kind

904
00:42:56.990 --> 00:42:59.390
of IRC where the people
that you're talking to, you're

905
00:42:59.390 --> 00:43:02.900
not actually listening to them.
You're not following because there

906
00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:06.590
isn't reciprocity with following which
there is on IRC. Well,

907
00:43:06.590 --> 00:43:08.570
this is like me not
listening to you now because

908
00:43:08.570 --> 00:43:11.990
I'm Twittering. Twitter is the
downfall of discourse. And I'm

909
00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:13.880
trying to remember how to
feel. I'm doing this with

910
00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:20.150
the one hand though. Discourse
period, quote at Spolsky. And

911
00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:23.660
I spoke this course. Nope.
I think I just made

912
00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:29.930
you Spolsky enter. There we
go. Now I feel complete.

913
00:43:32.650 --> 00:43:36.470
I put that out there.
Okay. There's a funny Twitter.

914
00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:38.210
Now. The great thing is
that I never, I didn't

915
00:43:38.210 --> 00:43:39.590
have to back that up.
You don't, you don't have

916
00:43:39.590 --> 00:43:40.850
to back that up. I
don't have to back that

917
00:43:40.850 --> 00:43:42.770
up. People can argue with
us, but that's not real.

918
00:43:42.770 --> 00:43:44.300
And there's no proof that
you even said it. Right.

919
00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:46.190
Just because I Twittered that
doesn't mean it really happened.

920
00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:49.790
Oh, cool. Well, Joel, thanks
so much for sitting down

921
00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:51.290
with me today and talk
to her. I appreciate it.

922
00:43:51.650 --> 00:43:54.170
It's great to have a
tour of the place. Yeah,

923
00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:55.370
hopefully I get to come
and hang out with you

924
00:43:55.370 --> 00:43:57.350
again. Next time I'm in
New York. Cool. That'll be awesome.

925
00:43:57.380 --> 00:43:59.270
Thanks for having me on.
All right. This has been

926
00:43:59.270 --> 00:44:01.610
another episode of Hansel minutes
and I'll see you again

927
00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:02.060
next week.
