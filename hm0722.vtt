11
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.430
This is another episode of
Hansel minutes today. I'm talking

12
00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.880
with Eugene sender. LinkedIn is
the lead on scum VM,

13
00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.130
and they are celebrating the
release of blade runner available

14
00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.070
for purchase on digital copy
at Gog. This is a

15
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.690
point and click adventure game
developed by Westwood studios originally

16
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.300
in 1997. And now thanks
to the effort of gawg

17
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.670
and the great work of
the folks at scum available

18
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.820
for the first time. Again.
Thank you sir, for talking

19
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.100
with me today. Thank you,
Scott. And hello everyone. I

20
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.260
have been a, a big
fan of these kind of

21
00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.460
classic graphical point and click
adventure games. They all have

22
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.400
a certain style. We've all
seen them before games like

23
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.380
maniac mansion and a day
of the tentacle. They all

24
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.650
look similar because they're all
kind of coming from the

25
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.030
same place. What is the
history of these games? Oh,

26
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.560
the history of these games
are coming from LucasArts. So

27
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.080
they had this small, initially
a small game department and

28
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.860
they had a number of
prominent and talented people and

29
00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.120
collected there. And this is
where it comes from. And

30
00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.970
by the way, the name
of scandium project is coming

31
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.670
from the subsystem, which they
created for implemented those case

32
00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.980
games. So scum is the
abbreviated us script creation utility

33
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.470
for manic mansion. This is
the project comes from and

34
00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.390
it's script creation, utility for
maniac mansion, virtual machine, and

35
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.570
in a world of things
like Mame, the multi arcade

36
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.960
machine emulator, it's significant. Don't
you think that it's not

37
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:39.800
called the script creation utility
emulator? Absolutely. Because we repeatedly

38
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.440
were telling that a scum
BM is not an emulator.

39
00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.170
Actually we do have several
emulators primarily for the sound

40
00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.880
cards like MP3 to, or
at least inside of it,

41
00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.520
but it's going to be,
and it's still not why.

42
00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:01.390
So, because originally LucasArts and
Sierra, They came up with

43
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.220
this clever idea of creating
a virtual machine, civil similar

44
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.720
to Java VM, let's say,
because it tastes some small

45
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.580
set of up codes. Then
it has languages, which would

46
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.020
be easier for artists and
non-developers to understand and write

47
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:25.540
the game script. And after
that, then in order to

48
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.500
import the game to a
certain new platform, and you

49
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.080
know, at that time we
had released this for many

50
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.130
platforms like Amiga Harry Mac
doors, all of them at

51
00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:41.500
once, it was much low,
lower effort. So this is

52
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.980
where VM comes from. So
we are just yet another

53
00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.360
implementation of that virtual machine.
That is how it started.

54
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.500
So When I was running
these games in the nineties,

55
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.620
myself on a machine, was
I running a virtual machine

56
00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.810
of sorts or script runner
when I was running on

57
00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.530
the original dos implementation that
came yeah. From the LucasArts

58
00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.770
and year onlines, precisely, this
is what you were doing.

59
00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.420
Just, you didn't know about
this And where have these

60
00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.390
companies gone. They're all, they're
all left and right. Is,

61
00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:18.560
is the, the, the is
the stuff underneath scum, like

62
00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.300
Abandoned where, and now this
is an open source project

63
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:22.920
that has picked it up.
Or have you worked with

64
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:27.000
any of the original engine?
I would say neither in

65
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.700
this particular case. So first
of all, I need to

66
00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:35.160
mention that abandon ware is
not a proper legal concept.

67
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.420
And this is very important
because yes, because many people

68
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.510
have misunderstand that they come
to us and say, Hey,

69
00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.180
this game is 20 years
old. Can I download it

70
00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.270
from somewhere? No, very good
point. You know that the

71
00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.110
copyright law is called Mickey
mouse law because they extended

72
00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:57.450
it. They lobbied currently it
extends to 85 years. So

73
00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.500
those companies, some of them
are defunct. Some of them

74
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.310
not. So currently we sup
we have over 60 engines.

75
00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.150
I, I didn't count last
time. So what is happening?

76
00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.230
We have, let's say two
big buckets of four games

77
00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.640
of game engines. One of
those, and this is particularly

78
00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.490
talking about scum in this
particular case. This is when

79
00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.690
we reverse engineer it from
the scratch we implemented and

80
00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:28.980
we enhance it along the
way. So in many cases

81
00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:34.050
it does, it has very
little resembles we original source

82
00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.380
code. Why I'm telling you,
because later we were acquiring

83
00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.440
illegally source code for some
of those engines, which were

84
00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:44.970
already implemented. And second to
bucket is when in fact

85
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:51.300
original developers or current IP,
right holders approach us. They

86
00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:56.130
give us the source codes,
usually under NDA. Sometimes not

87
00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:00.620
sometimes it's like free for
all and they just ask

88
00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.520
us, Hey, I put my
soul and time and sweet

89
00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.220
in this game. It is
so sad to see it

90
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:10.970
dying dead. Now, not possible
to run. Could you guys

91
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:15.410
please like use it and
make it portable because Cambium

92
00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.100
is all about portability. So
those are two parts. And

93
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.490
I would say about 30%
of our engines are based

94
00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:25.400
on the original source Scott
and the two thirds are

95
00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:29.390
actual reverse engineering from this
crash, which is long and

96
00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:34.360
tedious process. Wow. Now why?
And forgive my ignorance for

97
00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:38.350
the question, but if it
were an emulator of sorts,

98
00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:40.780
like the difference between an
emulator and something like scum

99
00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:44.260
VM is that an emulator
picks up those byte codes

100
00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.690
and just kind of runs
them and emulates pretends to

101
00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:50.290
be another system. But you
know, games based on the

102
00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:53.680
scum VM engine ran on
a tare or NES or

103
00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.050
Amiga they didn't, they weren't
all created on dos or

104
00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:00.220
windows. Why are there engines?
Why are there multiple engine?

105
00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:04.480
Why isn't there just one
Implementation of an engine? Okay.

106
00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:08.650
So because, because it's exactly,
if it would be an

107
00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:12.640
emulator and you have a
perfect emulator, you have those

108
00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:17.290
box, for instance, which emulates
a typical PC, like a

109
00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:20.080
bare bones, which allows to
run your dose and in

110
00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:28.210
deployment, it's also emulate dose
int interruptions. And then you

111
00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:31.480
have those box and then
you ran practically everything. I

112
00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:36.490
dunno, from Edlin to Microsoft
office on the same thing

113
00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:40.030
and it's one for all,
but then it comes with

114
00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:45.150
a cost of, of really,
really high resource demand whilst

115
00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:49.510
come VM is just re
implementation of the original engine

116
00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:53.620
and what is happening then
if you're just consider that

117
00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:58.420
those games are pretty old,
the mainly comes from eighties

118
00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:02.590
from nineties. So the, some
of the ports of Cambium,

119
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:09.820
they have a 35 or
33 megahertz CPU. They have

120
00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:12.880
like one Meg or two
megabytes, like an internal double

121
00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:18.400
screen of Ram. They may
have a Jew, no desks

122
00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:24.220
or anything, just a cartridge
like Nintendo 64. And then

123
00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:28.360
you can imagine that the
resource requirements are very low

124
00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:32.620
and portable as such, because
then you can run it

125
00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:36.670
on the mobile devices without
fear of running your drawing,

126
00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:40.600
draining your battery or something
like this. Oh, okay. And

127
00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:43.780
this would allow you also
to make games available from

128
00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:47.290
one engine available everywhere. So
games that were never released

129
00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:49.450
for Dosser or windows can
now be moved over here.

130
00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:54.130
Absolutely. Because a house can
be works internally. We have

131
00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:58.770
a hardware abstraction layer it's
called old system. And then

132
00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:05.730
once some developer familiar with
some specific platform comes and

133
00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:09.000
they implement as we call
it backend for this platform,

134
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.780
then all of the engines,
which will be compatible with

135
00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:17.370
physical capabilities of this machine
would just run. And similarly,

136
00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:21.960
if an engine author comes
to us and writes an

137
00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:25.590
engine on top of our
system, that would mean that

138
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:28.950
it will run on practically
all of the ports, which

139
00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:32.190
we have, why I'm mentioning
that practically all of them,

140
00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:35.790
because sometimes you might have
restrictions. Like you may have

141
00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:40.020
a certain resolution hardware resolution
for the screen. You may

142
00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:45.000
have certain games requiring keyboard
input, but you don't and

143
00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:49.910
stuff like this in the,
in the past, On the

144
00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:53.330
emulator side, a lot of
projects have had an uncomfortable

145
00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:58.790
relationship with, with publishers, but
it's a significant, at least

146
00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:02.360
from my perspective as a
user, that scum VM as

147
00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.850
a Open source project seems
to have a very positive

148
00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:08.720
relationship with publishers. Is that
been a conscious decision on

149
00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.870
the part of the team
to partner with publishers, respect,

150
00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:16.910
copyright, and then work on
formally releasing game? That's a,

151
00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:22.910
that's a very good question
because it touches deeply the,

152
00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:27.470
exactly the question of abandoned,
where from the very beginning,

153
00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:32.000
we wanted to strictly for
the copyright law. And we

154
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.670
had the term in the,
in the, in the past,

155
00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:37.760
we had several attempts from
LucasArts and also from other

156
00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:41.270
parties to send a cease
and desist letter, et cetera.

157
00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:44.780
But since we are not
violating the copyright law, because

158
00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:48.500
always you would need to
have original game assets. It's

159
00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:50.930
going to be a mess,
just the executive bill, a

160
00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:56.330
drop in replacement. Then there
was no thing in like

161
00:10:56.570 --> 00:11:01.040
unlawful, and this is why
it gives safety and give

162
00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:03.380
safety to the project, first
of all. But then it

163
00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:08.000
gives the safety and assurance
to the let's say IP

164
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.890
rights owners, which interests us
their intellectual property, like a

165
00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:17.480
game assets or for studying
or original source code, because

166
00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:21.890
we have a reputation of
not giving away anything of

167
00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:25.730
not disclosing anything, which we
have NDA signed. And this

168
00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:29.630
is why many companies actually
happy to collaborate with us.

169
00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:33.110
And I can, for instance
mentioned, one of the biggest

170
00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:39.530
recent releases is a missed
anniversary, correct collection 25th years.

171
00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:43.730
This was created in close
collaboration between CRM and the

172
00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:47.300
scum BM. Unfortunately we had,
they lost all the source

173
00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:50.810
codes. We had the implementation
between DEET, a lot of

174
00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:56.020
number one enhancement specifically for
this. And we, as a

175
00:11:56.020 --> 00:12:03.670
result released ultimate multilanguage game
for the Raven and for

176
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:06.670
the mist and for the
missed masterpiece, which was not

177
00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:10.150
existing, just because if we
were just working with the

178
00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:13.540
IP rights owners and they
were safe with us, we

179
00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:16.750
were cool with them. And
as you see, this is,

180
00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:19.680
this is there, it's on
the market. It feels like

181
00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:22.020
it would be really hard
to find the people who

182
00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:26.310
own the intellectual property 20,
30 years later, is that

183
00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:29.430
part of the partnership that
you have with folks like,

184
00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:32.910
like Gog, that they help
hunt those people down and

185
00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:35.220
then negotiate that. Cause I'm
assuming that's not the fun

186
00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:36.870
part of the job. You
want to write some cool

187
00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:43.680
code. Yes, it is pretty
challenging. And very often sometimes

188
00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:46.800
we come approach. So what
we do, we do just

189
00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:50.550
approach different people or from
the credits for different games.

190
00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:52.410
And Hey, do you still
have it? Do you still

191
00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:57.750
have, can you legally share
it with us blahblahblah.com or

192
00:12:57.750 --> 00:13:03.120
what helps is that they
collaborate with IP rights owners

193
00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:06.240
and very often those IP
rights owners that could be

194
00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:09.270
third party, not original ones,
but then they can get

195
00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:12.900
assets and it can give
a perfect example about this.

196
00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:17.400
One of the latest games
on scum still not yet

197
00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:22.380
supported fully is Mon base
commander. It is the multitest.

198
00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:25.920
The engine was extremely enhanced
and it was in a

199
00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:28.530
limbo for a long while.
But then I noticed on

200
00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:31.260
gold.com that they started to
sell it. And I Haven

201
00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:33.990
good relationship with them. I
approach them and say, Hey

202
00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:37.500
folks, do you still have,
like, could you please contact,

203
00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:43.260
introduce me towards the IP
rights owners, appearance owners were

204
00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.920
super happy about this because
they were they're seeking for

205
00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:51.300
increased compatibility. Currently a Mon
base commander is windows only.

206
00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:53.460
They would like to private
on Mac for Linux, other

207
00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:58.410
platforms. And as such, they
just under NDA shared with

208
00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:01.680
the team. And particularly with
me, the game sets the

209
00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:05.730
original source code. And we
find that we're able to

210
00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:08.850
start working on the missing
pieces. So yes, it does

211
00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:14.730
happen. The So Disney released
maniac mansion on steam and

212
00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:16.500
Disney. I think of it
as being, as you said,

213
00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:19.680
with the Mickey mouse, copyright
laws, the biggest and scariest

214
00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:24.120
and most kind of aggressive,
you know, they, they, they,

215
00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:29.820
they They're copyright very yes,
significantly. So exactly there is

216
00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:34.410
no problem because you have
difference. So gamma says a

217
00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:40.290
copyrighted game engine, you stand
alone. So they pre they

218
00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:44.790
provide the full scum VM
source code. So they comply

219
00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:47.880
with GPL. We are happy
and they are happy because

220
00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:52.850
now Monica mentioned runs on
Linux coming from steam. That's

221
00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:55.940
amazing. And just to be
clear for the audience who

222
00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:59.540
is listening, maniac mansion ran
on dos. If I recall

223
00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:04.520
exclusively in the early nineties,
actually not really because that

224
00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:07.610
one is yes, those Amiga
Atari, but the whole day,

225
00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:11.810
all the debt, any yes.
Even yes. At the time

226
00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:15.020
now they're in Mack and
those are all loan debt.

227
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:17.780
You cannot run this on
any modern hardware. Of course

228
00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:20.060
you can run it in
those box or in, let's

229
00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:23.840
say Amiga and later, but
as I mentioned, you would

230
00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:27.410
need to know the specifics
of a mega platform in

231
00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:30.830
order to even launch it
from your chill floppy or

232
00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:35.510
whatever. What you're doing while
with Cambium has just pointed

233
00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:39.830
to the game and push
the button, run, start the

234
00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:44.890
game. Okay. Fantastic. Hi, friends
as a programmer, you think

235
00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:49.210
an objects with Mongo DB.
So does your database, Mongo

236
00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:53.020
DB is the most popular
document-based database built for modern

237
00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:57.250
application developers on the cloud
era, millions of developers use

238
00:15:57.250 --> 00:16:00.490
Mongo DB to power. The
world's most innovative products and

239
00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:06.460
services from cryptocurrency to online
gaming IOT and more, you

240
00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:10.510
can try Mongo DB today
with Atlas, the global cloud

241
00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:14.530
database service that runs on
AWS Azure and Google cloud

242
00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:18.070
configure, deploy and connect to
your database in just a

243
00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:24.580
few minutes, check it out
at Mongo db.com/atlas. That's M

244
00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:31.150
O N G O db.com/atlas.
Yeah, I've had a physical

245
00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:34.780
copy of blade runner since
I think 90, 97 or

246
00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:37.210
98. And it's just been
a great, a great game.

247
00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:40.030
And a couple of years
ago, I tried getting it

248
00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:43.480
running under an emulator and
had all kinds of challenges

249
00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:47.020
around a resolution and kind
of just gave it up,

250
00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:49.570
trying to figure out how
to get a labor in

251
00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:52.150
it, to work. And then
I heard that it was

252
00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:56.290
now available again for purchase.
And it's been referred to

253
00:16:56.290 --> 00:16:59.770
by you as the Holy
grail of a game's first

254
00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:02.020
come VM. What is it?
That's so challenging. And so

255
00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:07.840
mysterious about blade runner. Yeah.
Blade runner. Oh, we were

256
00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:11.680
dreaming about support of it.
So, so many years I,

257
00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:14.500
myself, it was on my
short list of the titles,

258
00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:19.330
which I would love to
see. And it joined like

259
00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:23.500
completed this list. The, as
the latest thin is it

260
00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:32.380
laid there, honor, doesn't have
this VM and everything. And

261
00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:37.480
the game is written in
plain C I think, or

262
00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:42.940
C plus plus for everything.
So basically every location is

263
00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:46.450
a separate DLL and there
are over 60 of those.

264
00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:51.240
So I'm all out of
reverse engineering work is enormous.

265
00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:57.000
At some point in time,
it was the biggest engine

266
00:17:57.090 --> 00:18:02.370
and it's come VM recently
just overshadowed by the internet

267
00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:05.790
in a interactive fiction. It's
a collection of engines running

268
00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:10.410
under a single umbrella, but
it was bigger than scum

269
00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:13.890
engine, which supports like 30
titles. It was bigger than

270
00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:20.850
Sierra SEI, which supports like
other 50 titles. And it

271
00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:23.400
is just for a single
game. It is over a

272
00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:28.740
hundred thousand lines of code
in scum VM, all written

273
00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:34.560
manually for out of this
assembly. It was tremendous amount

274
00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:37.980
of work for people were
working in it. I was

275
00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:41.430
also doing big chunk of
work for every actor because

276
00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:45.000
every actor is a state
machine with a quite complex

277
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:50.850
logic. It, I think at
this moment, we know it's

278
00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:54.360
not the thing is definitely
the biggest effort of the

279
00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:57.330
team so far. This is
the biggest amount of time

280
00:18:57.330 --> 00:19:01.140
which we spent so far.
It's very, very technical complex.

281
00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:05.130
And the game itself internally
is not an easy, if

282
00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:08.970
you heard about the capabilities
of the flexibility of the

283
00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:12.330
game and that you have
like 16 endings, and then

284
00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:18.450
there is like a diff
relationships between those non playable

285
00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:21.060
characters and they game, they
developed for the game. So

286
00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:23.730
this is why you have
a lot higher reliability. All

287
00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:26.250
of this logic has to
be re implemented by us.

288
00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:30.830
Wow. And people, I mean,
this game was incredibly ahead

289
00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:33.200
of its time. I mean,
it was using voxels and

290
00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:38.090
combining 3d and characters and
two D backgrounds. This is,

291
00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:41.690
I know that there was
talk of how hard it

292
00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:44.390
is to have 3d in
scum versus 2d. It gets

293
00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:47.600
exponentially more difficult. The more
that's happening on the screen,

294
00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:51.440
isn't it? Yes and no,
because my granddad particularly is

295
00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:56.180
not a three to gain.
It uses a WorkSource, but

296
00:19:56.240 --> 00:20:01.850
it is just basically how
to say pre renders out

297
00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:05.750
of voxels over those sprites
for EITs for actors and

298
00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:10.100
then just renders them. So
it is, you cannot like,

299
00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:14.480
let's say turn the camera.
The camera is always fixed

300
00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:18.170
point because as you mentioned,
the ground background is just

301
00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:22.160
two D three dimensional and
it has no polygon. So

302
00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:26.300
there is no, you cannot
accelerate it with open GL

303
00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:32.240
RTA FGX or whatever. It's
all software rendering. So actual

304
00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:35.750
part, which deals at least
with three points is maybe

305
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:39.320
like 500 lines of code.
The rest of a hundred

306
00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:43.940
thousand is, has nothing to
do with three D What

307
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.470
was the hardest part of
it? And how did you

308
00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:49.300
split the responsibility up? Because
the team is, you know,

309
00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:51.130
you're not all sitting in
the same place, right? You're

310
00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:57.120
geographically distributed. We are using
Trello, Trello board. And do

311
00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:58.790
you, is it, is it
something that, you know, you

312
00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:00.690
said it's big and it's
a lot of code and

313
00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:04.740
it's tangled. Do you split
up responsibility by subsystem? Like,

314
00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:08.490
okay, you handle resolution and
you handle audio. How do

315
00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:10.740
you split up Your responsibility?
Yes, it was. That was

316
00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:14.310
when they, so the engine
started to work on, it

317
00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:19.050
started about eight years ago.
We started, we implemented character

318
00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:24.390
like rendering for scene and
that, and then it was

319
00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:28.980
dead. It was then staying
in limbo for maybe like

320
00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:33.180
four, I would say four
years or so. And then

321
00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:37.560
Peter Peter cohort came out
of blue with maybe like

322
00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:42.060
20,000 lines of code already,
additional reverse engineers. He joined

323
00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:46.010
the team and he sparkled
this interest in us. So

324
00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:49.950
made moves another, a guy
who originally started the engine.

325
00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:55.380
He was excited and Peter
continued with Kia, these internal

326
00:21:55.380 --> 00:22:00.750
complex database for clues. Then
I was working on actors,

327
00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:05.610
logic and <inaudible> was working
on the logic for every

328
00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:08.310
location. So this is how
we were doing. And then

329
00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:13.230
whatever issues or whatever new
subsystem we were finding, we

330
00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:16.470
were just dropping, creating a
new card on Trello. And

331
00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:19.980
then whoever completes their task,
this is what, how we

332
00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:24.270
were doing. I would say
that my part of it

333
00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:29.340
was episodical. However, it led
to maybe like 20,000 lines

334
00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:33.240
of code written because of
just the number of those

335
00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:37.620
actors logic, but then the
folks, the other folks were

336
00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:42.570
making it to the production
quality. Wow. Now I understand

337
00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:44.760
that this has been, what,
eight years, nine years or

338
00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:47.310
longer in the, in the
making the reverse engineering, is

339
00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:49.530
that full time work or
is it something that happens

340
00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:51.240
where you do a whole
lot of work and then

341
00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:54.180
you wait for a lawyer
for, It was a, it

342
00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:57.690
started eight years ago, but
the bulk of work, and

343
00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:01.680
I would say that eight
years ago, till five years

344
00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:05.640
ago from now 5% of
it were written. And then

345
00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:08.370
it was much, much faster
of a current pinup and

346
00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:12.270
the completed bulk of the
work where most of the

347
00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:19.500
workforce finished in 2018 and
17. And definitely it is

348
00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:22.620
not a full term work
because all of us work

349
00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:25.050
for the companies, we are
all volunteers, but I was

350
00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:31.290
spending every evening on doing
like all of those actors,

351
00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:34.650
because there are, I don't
remember like 60 or so

352
00:23:34.670 --> 00:23:40.620
like huge amount. And for
some logic is pretty simple.

353
00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:43.230
Maybe a simple is like
500 lines of code, but

354
00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:47.600
some of them like thousands
lines of code. So it

355
00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:53.140
took time. Well, the idea
that these projects, we think

356
00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:55.840
we, the community that, that,
that just get to go

357
00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:59.080
now and go to, to
Gog, buy a game for

358
00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:02.050
$10 and enjoy it. And
I think the important part

359
00:24:02.050 --> 00:24:05.440
is to simply enjoy it
because it just works. We

360
00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:09.430
sometimes forget the cast of
thousands and the years and

361
00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:12.130
years of work behind it,
especially when it's open source

362
00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:14.950
work and everyone has a
day job. It's definitely a

363
00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:18.910
passion project. Exactly. Because a
squat important thing, we are

364
00:24:18.910 --> 00:24:21.640
not paid for this. We
were not paid by Gog

365
00:24:21.670 --> 00:24:25.960
or anyone else. So this
is why, for instance, when

366
00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:28.960
people come to us angrily
and they say, hi, why

367
00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:32.590
are you so dumb that
you implemented this feature? Sometimes

368
00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:36.640
it's a bit frustrating and
discouraging to hear. Maybe we

369
00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:40.570
do it out of love.
And the, the, the very

370
00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:44.260
fact that you like random
John DOE is able to

371
00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:47.830
play. It is just a
counter product of all of

372
00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:51.190
us, of our love. Not
that you're entitled to do

373
00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:56.800
it. We don't benefit from
golf selling these game. Unless

374
00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:59.440
of course we have only
just affiliation program with them,

375
00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:04.060
but not on bulk. Hmm.
That's a really important point.

376
00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:07.150
And it is also important
for you to know, and

377
00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:09.370
for, I hope the other
members of the team to

378
00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:12.400
know how much it truly
is appreciated for, for me

379
00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:15.370
to be able to sit
down with my now 10

380
00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:18.790
year old and 12 year
old and play maniac mansion

381
00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:21.100
or blade runner and share
with them something that was

382
00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:23.920
important to me when I
was a kid and have

383
00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:28.150
it just work is truly,
truly extraordinary. And then when

384
00:25:28.150 --> 00:25:29.980
they're older to even be
able to go and look

385
00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:32.710
at the source code, if
they decide to become programmers

386
00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:36.520
and discuss the technology behind
it with them adds another

387
00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:39.730
exciting layer to that relationship
that we have with these

388
00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:43.870
games. Oh, I is like
your experience. Scott is really

389
00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:47.440
related to me because one
of my biggest motivation to

390
00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:51.700
work as Cambium was because
I found how marvelous humongous

391
00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:55.930
entertainment, entertainment games are. And
I was making sure that

392
00:25:55.930 --> 00:26:01.630
I'm raising my daughters on
Freddie fish, but part pajama,

393
00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:04.090
Sam. And this is where
we put a lot of

394
00:26:04.090 --> 00:26:07.900
effort into it. Yes. Yeah.
It's really special, isn't it?

395
00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:14.170
Yes, absolutely. So the, the,
the most amazing thing in

396
00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:15.940
the least the most recent
thing that you all have

397
00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:18.220
done is blade runner. But
I also understand that sometimes

398
00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:21.340
you'll just find some obscure
game and someone will get

399
00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:23.590
excited about it and you'll
get support for it. Just

400
00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:27.610
because how do you balance
your time between the eight,

401
00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:31.750
the eight, a year long
experience or something like blade

402
00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:33.730
runner, and then just finding
a game that maybe only

403
00:26:33.730 --> 00:26:35.710
a few dozen people will
play and then making support

404
00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:40.960
for that. So we are
making support for random games

405
00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:46.350
only, and only if the
person comes or somebody comes

406
00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:51.900
to us with the full
source code, then the rest

407
00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:57.390
were done just because somebody,
some scum BM developer has

408
00:26:57.450 --> 00:27:01.140
passionate about this game and
they have personal interest and

409
00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:03.780
they would like to do
it like how the project

410
00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:08.730
started. The project started because
two person independently, one wanted

411
00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:11.760
to play monkey Island, two
only an X and another

412
00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:18.150
one on month monkey Island
one and the first one

413
00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:22.560
after implemented monkey Island to
want to make an it

414
00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:25.410
playable. And then just a
couple of more games from

415
00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:28.950
scummy engine just left. And
we had a number of

416
00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:32.070
people like this, come into
us, working couple for a

417
00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:34.620
couple of years on an
engine and then leave in

418
00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:38.130
the project. This is how
it works. So when somebody

419
00:27:38.130 --> 00:27:40.650
comes to us and say,
Hey, I would like to

420
00:27:41.010 --> 00:27:45.390
you, like, I have this
childhood memory, could you please

421
00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:51.870
implement it? You know, it's
difficult to justify working like

422
00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:54.480
half a year, at least
half a year of your

423
00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:57.900
free time in the evenings
on something you don't find

424
00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:01.020
interest in, you are not
attached to. If there is

425
00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:06.060
a source code, the work
makes becomes much, much easier.

426
00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:09.600
Now on the source court,
when we had this, like

427
00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:13.920
the typical time when you
have something playable is like

428
00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:17.160
month or two much faster.
So this is why it

429
00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:21.030
is like cool, because then
our library of supported game

430
00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:25.170
six to expanded. But other
than that, no, like this

431
00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:28.200
is the fat chance that
somebody would just work on

432
00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:32.810
it just because they've been
asked, There's some pretty cool

433
00:28:32.810 --> 00:28:36.890
stories of like, for example,
Terry Pratchett and perfect entertainment

434
00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:40.430
found the source code for
Discworld and disc world too,

435
00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:43.760
and made that available to
you Became available. And then

436
00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:47.570
also, you know, Games that
might not necessarily be interesting

437
00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:50.960
globally. It might be interesting
locally, like is a Polish

438
00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:54.320
game. The, it was created
in 1995 and the teams

439
00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:56.270
Like, you know, we want
to make sure that this

440
00:28:56.270 --> 00:28:58.940
lives beyond us and it
doesn't get lost. So if

441
00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:01.730
someone wants to play this
game, they can. That's pretty

442
00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:05.210
amazing. Exactly. One of the
great examples of this is

443
00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:09.710
the author of dream wave,
a doom web. There is

444
00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:13.850
this game, dream web top
down adventure, and they author,

445
00:29:13.910 --> 00:29:16.580
it came to us and
he told, Hey, recently copyright

446
00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:20.300
was returned to me. Here
is the source code. Go

447
00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:22.550
ahead, do it. And by
the way, here's the game

448
00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:25.820
of sets. Make it three,
where do it. We were

449
00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:28.610
so happy about this. Wow.
This how, what happened? He

450
00:29:28.610 --> 00:29:32.120
wanted to exactly. He wanted
his game, his creation to

451
00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:36.710
leave beyond all of those
old agent platforms That is

452
00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:42.130
significant really, really significant dream
web is a 1994 cyberpunk

453
00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:44.980
game. And the idea that
something is being rereleased as

454
00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:48.880
freeware when their copyright is
returned, that really speaks to

455
00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:50.770
that original thing that we
talked about at the beginning

456
00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:54.040
of the discussion about abandoned,
where is not a thing,

457
00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:57.130
right. It does it maybe
forgotten, but it's never abandoned.

458
00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:01.120
Know there's always some legal
thing going on there, correct?

459
00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:05.380
Yeah. So how can we
help scum VM? You say

460
00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:08.860
that you're not in it
for the money, there's a

461
00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:11.170
large team working on it.
Do you want us the

462
00:30:11.170 --> 00:30:15.000
audience to just Bye and
support The games that are

463
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.940
really released on scum VM?
Or how can we let

464
00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:19.770
you know that we appreciate
all the things that we're

465
00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:23.160
doing that you're doing? There
are a couple of ways

466
00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:26.130
of doing it. And let
me just mention it the

467
00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:29.700
oldest in order of our
preference, but not necessarily of

468
00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:34.680
order of being easy for
the audience, what we would

469
00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:38.910
appreciate the most, if it
developers for instance, at this

470
00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:43.200
moment, and this is really,
really painful for us, that

471
00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:46.560
these games are pointed in
clique. And as you imagine,

472
00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:49.770
and by the way, Krung
Gilbert himself was mentioned when

473
00:30:49.770 --> 00:30:54.690
we had a port on
iOS that finally he has

474
00:30:54.690 --> 00:30:57.030
monkey Island, as it meant
to be, to be played

475
00:30:57.150 --> 00:31:02.580
with, with your fingertips, not
with a mouse, but we

476
00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:06.900
don't have an iOS Porter
for several years now, same

477
00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:12.570
with Android. We don't have
like young generation who has

478
00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:15.750
experienced with this platform. They
think in about, Oh, instead

479
00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:18.930
of working off some open
source project, let me let

480
00:31:19.170 --> 00:31:22.320
for myself, do some coding
and put my, I dunno

481
00:31:22.890 --> 00:31:26.250
game, which, Hey, make it
or on, on store and

482
00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:29.310
get some bucks. Why should
I spend time on some

483
00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:32.910
guys for free? And this
is a problem because on

484
00:31:32.910 --> 00:31:37.350
Android, we have over a
half million installs, but we

485
00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:42.150
have troubles with anything beyond
Android seven, which is now

486
00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:45.990
how, what five years old.
So any developers here in

487
00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:48.450
this and would like to
join the open source project

488
00:31:48.810 --> 00:31:54.480
with like over $15 million loads,
there are certain benefits that

489
00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:59.160
would be our most preference.
A second one, if, you

490
00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:05.550
know, for instance, somebody who
possesses the source code four

491
00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:08.430
or pieces of source code
for some game, you love,

492
00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:12.570
you care for them, let
them contact to us. Maybe

493
00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:14.790
we can work on this
game. So this would be

494
00:32:14.790 --> 00:32:19.590
the second preference, third one,
a non-developers. But those who

495
00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:23.460
would like to help the
project, for instance, keeping our

496
00:32:23.550 --> 00:32:28.200
menu and documentation up to
date. So you just need

497
00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:32.310
to know or translate it
into another language other than

498
00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:38.010
English, like in German, Russian,
Chinese, whatever, because now we

499
00:32:38.010 --> 00:32:43.790
have capabilities for, for translation.
This is also the last

500
00:32:43.790 --> 00:32:46.400
one. Not that we need
it, but there is always

501
00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:50.720
PayPal button. Or when you
buy in a games for,

502
00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:55.130
from Google, from gog.com, if
you use our affiliation link,

503
00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:57.590
the price for you stays
the same. We would have

504
00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:01.820
just small commission out of
it also could help us

505
00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:06.470
to pay hosting, but this
is the least preference. Very

506
00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:08.870
cool. I'm going to make
sure to include in the

507
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:11.240
show notes, links to all
of the things that you've

508
00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:14.450
talked about as well as
a link to by blade

509
00:33:14.450 --> 00:33:17.720
runner on Gog using your
affiliate link. So we hopefully

510
00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:20.870
we'll hear from some folks
who are listening to the

511
00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:23.090
show and appreciate all the
hard work that you and

512
00:33:23.090 --> 00:33:25.460
the team put into this
thing. It has really been

513
00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:27.530
a joy to chat with
you today, and it's been

514
00:33:27.530 --> 00:33:29.960
a real joy to play
blade runner again, and other

515
00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:33.050
games that are now supported
over 250 games in the

516
00:33:33.050 --> 00:33:36.050
library of adventures that you
can play with scum VM.

517
00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:38.360
Thank you so much for
chatting with me. Yeah. Thank

518
00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:41.030
you, Scott. It was a
pleasure. We've been talking with

519
00:33:41.030 --> 00:33:43.910
your gene, Sandra Lanco from
scum VM project. You can

520
00:33:43.910 --> 00:33:49.340
check them out@scummvm.org. There will
be links again in the

521
00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:52.820
show notes. This has been
another episode of Hanselminutes and

522
00:33:52.820 --> 00:34:05.800
we'll see you again next
week. <inaudible>.
