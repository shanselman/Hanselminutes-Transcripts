this episode, Scott talks accessibility

9
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:05.560
with developer socket shake. Hi,
this is Scott Hanselman and

10
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.030
this is another episode of
Hansel minutes and I'm here

11
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.270
on the Microsoft campus in
Redmond Washington. I'm actually sitting

12
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.320
down with sucker Schick, a
developer from Microsoft consulting services

13
00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.660
in the UK. So you've
come all this way and

14
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.180
I just happened to be
in Redmond. Thanks for taking

15
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.550
the time to sit down
with me. Hi, thanks for

16
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.110
allowing me to be here.
So we, we have a

17
00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.100
shared interest in, in accessibility
and, and you are blind.

18
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.890
You're a blind developer and
you have a vested interest

19
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.360
and also a professional interest
in making accessible computing experiences.

20
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.660
Yeah, that's correct. Do you
focus mostly on websites or

21
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.240
do you focus on which
rich client are? All things

22
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.710
accessible? All things so patients,
and though we don't do

23
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.160
accessibility as part of my
main job. It's obviously in

24
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.980
my mind in everything I
do, whether it's websites, WinForms

25
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.090
WPF Silverlight. Now this might
be a kind of a

26
00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.370
remedial question for you, but
I, and I spent a

27
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.070
lot of time using screen
readers and different applications for

28
00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.730
accessibility, but let's start at
the beginning for people who

29
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.700
may not know what is
the experience for a blind

30
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.890
developer working on in windows,
whether it be on XP

31
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.340
or Vista, how are you
interacting with the machine? Okay.

32
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.820
So the traditional way is
keyboard and mouse monitor out.

33
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.550
So the first thing people
don't realize is that you

34
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.180
can't use the mouse. So
from an input perspective, everything

35
00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.180
is done via the keyboard
and as a windows developer,

36
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.670
I'm sure you know, that
visual studio is just awesome

37
00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.380
for keyboard shortcuts in terms
of output, then it speaker.

38
00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.710
But so there's a program
in the background monitoring what's

39
00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:45.610
happening and verbalizing that in
synthetic speech. And is there

40
00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.530
one particular application that's like,
they know there's a narrator

41
00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.930
that comes with with windows,
but I assume that's quickly

42
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.770
tossed aside. Yes, very quickly.
I use a program called

43
00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.800
jaws. I should say this
category of programs is called

44
00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.120
screen readers. And I use
one called Joel's, which is

45
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.490
quite popular. Now do applications
have to target jaws? Does

46
00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:08.130
visual studio as a windows
application have to do something

47
00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.680
to make it more accessible
to jaws or does jaws

48
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.000
just extra clever Jaws is
pretty clever. It hooks into

49
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.970
the video chain and sees
what's going into the monitor.

50
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.350
But what applications can do,
especially for custom controls is

51
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.520
what they call programmatic accessibility.
So that's allowing another program

52
00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.870
to integrate your UI and
see what's there. Oh, so

53
00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.100
how would I write it?
I mean, what would I

54
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.220
do to my application to
make it more accessible, to

55
00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.200
let, to let someone peek
in and see what's happening?

56
00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.800
So it's all about the
semantics, you know, adding meaning

57
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.030
to your UI, thinking beyond
a TD rectangle, in a

58
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.420
website, you're going to do
things like meaningful HTML markup

59
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:54.030
with Ajax. There's a new
standard called Aria, which means

60
00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:59.760
you put some tags around
your other HTML and WPF.

61
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:05.550
And Silverlight, there's a system.windows
dot automation, namespace, lots of

62
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.880
goodness in there. And with
wind forms, it's MSA, Microsoft

63
00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.110
active accessibility. So unfortunately there's
no one answer, But it

64
00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.240
is about, it is about
semantics. I just kind of

65
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.630
started thinking to myself, do,
do we want what is

66
00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.540
on the screen described? Really
not. You don't really care

67
00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.640
what's going on in the
screen from a, from a

68
00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.680
syntax perspective. Like, Hey, look,
he just put up a

69
00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.880
toolbox. That's not interesting to
you. So it's interesting that

70
00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.130
something appeared and it is
interesting that that thing is

71
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.700
a toolbox and how that's
presented to the user is,

72
00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.680
you know, can be presented
in different ways. And the

73
00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.140
great thing about the programmatic
accessibility is that it goes

74
00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.170
beyond just a screen reader
and blindness. That's the same

75
00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:49.680
thing that the windows Vista
speech recognition users. And, you

76
00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.080
know, if you're a tester,
it's what you would use

77
00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.830
for automated UI testing. Oh,
so the, the thing that

78
00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.160
jaws is doing to interrogate
an application is the exact

79
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.620
same thing that someone who's
doing automated UI testing would

80
00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.080
be using the same hooks.
Yes. And that's why I

81
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.940
think it's really great that
in Don history, WPF, they're

82
00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.290
calling it UI automation, which
doesn't directly mean anything to

83
00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:16.410
do with accessibility. It's just
for any reason, you'd have

84
00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.250
to automate a UI. So
there's nothing specific to accessibility

85
00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.130
that built into WPF. They
just simply make everything automateable

86
00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.480
Exactly. So you write your
classes for your custom controls

87
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.630
to make them automateable and
yeah, that achieves the accessibility,

88
00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.880
but that's not what they
call it. And that interests

89
00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.410
you by not calling it
that, do you think it's

90
00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.680
an easier sell because in
the, you know, I think

91
00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.900
it always gets in through
the back door. It's like,

92
00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.990
I think in the past
testers were a bit like,

93
00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.500
Ooh, we have to use
accessibility to test was this

94
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.990
way, or the hope is
it'll get broader adoption. Well,

95
00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.680
there's that sense that adding
accessibility, I mean, it just,

96
00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.330
just by the virtue of
the fact that I use

97
00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:58.130
the word adding, it's this
additional thing we have to

98
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.370
do, it's not bad enough.
We have to do Firefox

99
00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:04.190
and opera. Now we have
this other screen reader that,

100
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.610
you know, air quotes, nobody
uses a, and now we

101
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.710
think of something like jaws
or a screen reader as

102
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:13.580
being another target. So you've
definitely got to do your,

103
00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.930
your user testing. And that
seemed like not something most

104
00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:20.320
developers are interested in by
guests organizations do that, but

105
00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.920
as developers, yeah, it's just,
you're writing your classes, you're

106
00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.830
writing your C sharp or
whatever code, and it's just

107
00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:29.320
writing a bit more. So
every time you create a

108
00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:31.870
custom control, you write a
bit more code to give

109
00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:34.810
it Symantec's. So if I
were going to write an

110
00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:39.850
application that, that, you know,
brought up a table, jaws

111
00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:41.590
is gonna understand that I've
brought up a table of

112
00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:44.680
let's say stock prices. Yes.
So if you're using a

113
00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.760
standard data grid or whatever,
you know, a standard control,

114
00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:52.990
it will recognize that. And
do you care as a,

115
00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:56.890
as a vision impaired, blind
or blind person about sorting

116
00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:00.550
and rearranging column headers and
this kind of things? Yeah,

117
00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:03.310
definitely. Okay. So you're going
to customize a UI as

118
00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:06.700
much as anybody just for
your tastes. Now what about

119
00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:08.710
a chart? What does a
chart or pie chart mean

120
00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:12.340
to you? If it's, again,
if it's got no semantics,

121
00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:15.820
it means nothing, but if
you could represent the semantics,

122
00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:19.390
for example, you know, if
you're having a pie chart,

123
00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:23.560
which is a custom control,
which contains child controls of

124
00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:27.340
slice, then it's, if each
slice had semantic information saying

125
00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:31.770
it's labeled and it's present,
then that's really useful. Oh,

126
00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:34.990
okay. And then in WPF,
I would, I would add

127
00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:38.920
that bit of semantics. I
would decorate those. Unfortunately, you

128
00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.440
can't just do it as
an attribute. There are these

129
00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:45.370
automation peer classes you have
to, right. But they're not

130
00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:49.030
that complicated. You implement a
various interfaces depending on the

131
00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:52.450
type of your, what you
are a pattern it is.

132
00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:54.820
And then of course the,
the added benefit or the

133
00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:57.220
additional benefit is that now
I can test my pie

134
00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:02.590
chart exactly. For semantics. Yeah.
Interesting. Interesting. Now when creating

135
00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:05.670
a website, a lot of
people have this, I think

136
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:09.910
I call it checkbox accessibility,
where the government has mandated

137
00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:11.470
that you must follow. And
in the U S it's

138
00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:14.500
called section five Oh eight.
Yes. You know, if you

139
00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:16.480
are going, if you are
in a large government organization

140
00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.400
or if you're a bank
or whatever, your site must

141
00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:21.520
be accessible, it's the web
equivalent of the wheelchair ramp.

142
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.250
Yeah. Just as a wheelchair
ramp might be something that

143
00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:28.360
a building owner might not
embrace. Oftentimes the boss of

144
00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.220
a website is not going
to be thrilled about the

145
00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:33.160
idea that he has to
support accessibility. How do we

146
00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:36.340
avoid that kind of attitude?
So I think you got

147
00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:39.970
to target that at the
different types of people. So

148
00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:43.000
I think your exec, you're
a big decision maker to

149
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.150
him. Really the law mandating
is a really good thing

150
00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:49.180
because it makes it into
a fire on their desk,

151
00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:50.920
which really needs to be
put out. And if it's

152
00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.690
not a fire, it's not
going to get put out.

153
00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:56.580
But when you're talking to
developers so forth, yeah. There's

154
00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:58.950
the human part of accessibility,
but there's also the idea

155
00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:02.760
that everyone is different. And,
you know, you might be

156
00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:06.180
a teenager wanting to send
text messages without turning on

157
00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:09.600
the lights. You might be
the businessman who's wants to

158
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:12.060
notify his boss. That he's
going to be late while

159
00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:14.580
he's holding onto the rail
in the train. Oh, you

160
00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:17.190
know, you could be hurt
your back. And you know,

161
00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:19.170
you're lying in bed and
there's no computer you can

162
00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:22.140
use at the moment. So
it's thinking of everyone is

163
00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:24.780
different and you can't predict
what scenario different people are

164
00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:28.370
going to use your software.
Well then also within each,

165
00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:31.550
within each disability, whether it
be definition of blindness or,

166
00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:34.910
or a physical disability, there
are, there are gradients. Yes.

167
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:38.740
One is typically not 100%
able-bodied or completely disabled just

168
00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:43.400
as someone who's not entirely
lined. Yes. Now, would that

169
00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:46.580
mean that you would appreciate
like a, a high contrast

170
00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:49.360
option or, you know, what
it would have put a

171
00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:54.260
blind person appreciate really, really
large fonts or flashes or

172
00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.710
what other kinds of things
could one use Say the

173
00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:01.640
semantics really takes care of,
you know, people who run

174
00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:05.150
speech input or speech output,
or some agent interpreting the

175
00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:08.360
software for them. But you're
right. There are things like

176
00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:13.490
not only using color for
people who have colorblindness and

177
00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:17.030
high contrast for people with
partial sight, which are equally

178
00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:20.690
important. Jen, do, I haven't,
I've seen a lot of

179
00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:24.230
I've used jaws and I've
actually, there's a really great

180
00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:27.440
organization in New York called the
associated blind of New York that

181
00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:31.700
can provide QA people who
are of low sites to

182
00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:33.680
help you just catch up.
And they taught me a

183
00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:37.160
lot about how things like
jaws work, but I haven't

184
00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:40.010
seen a lot of applications
that sit in that middle

185
00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:43.460
place. I mean, there's, there's
flat with his regular windows.

186
00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:45.830
The way windows comes on
the one side of the

187
00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:48.320
spectrum on the other side
of the spectrum, there's jaws,

188
00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:51.800
which is everything things are
being read to you. Are

189
00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:55.820
there applications that will say
a strobe, the monitor when

190
00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:58.070
an email shows up, you
know, would that be a

191
00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:00.890
useful thing to someone who
can seek shapes and colors?

192
00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.960
I'm not sure, but the
type of thing you do

193
00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:06.770
get is everything ranging from
someone who's just got, you

194
00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:09.380
know, maybe getting elderly and
just wants to point the

195
00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:12.110
mouse at things. It has
a little square, which magnifies

196
00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:15.380
all the way through to
somebody who has a full

197
00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:18.560
screen magnifier, which magnifies the
entire screen up to 32

198
00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.260
times and can replace any
color on the screen with

199
00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.470
any other color of their
choice and all crazy stuff

200
00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:26.780
like that. And, you know,
track the mouse and the

201
00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:30.920
keyboard and really amazing stuff.
Now, how often do you

202
00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:33.650
get stuck? I'm curious, how
often do you find yourself

203
00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:35.990
in a situation where you
just start? You just have

204
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:39.140
to basically start all F
flooring More than I'd like,

205
00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:43.760
but certainly that does happen
a few times a day

206
00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:48.320
just because something's not accessible
or Jules is obviously doing

207
00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:53.000
a lot of low level
manipulation. So sometimes things go

208
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:57.190
there. And What does that,
what does that like? And

209
00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:59.200
I it's, I'm not asking
the question very right, but

210
00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:03.010
I'm trying to understand are
these state machine issues where

211
00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:05.380
maybe you got caught in
a series of popups, like,

212
00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:08.800
like just today and I
can, I've had LASIK eye

213
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.500
surgery. So even though I
was very, had very poor

214
00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:13.780
vision growing up, I can
see fine. Now I got

215
00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:15.280
caught in some kind of
a thing where we had

216
00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:19.750
48 popups and I, internet
Explorer went absolutely bonkers. And

217
00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:22.450
I had basically all their
flooring windows as fast as

218
00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:25.000
they could come. What happens
when that happens to you?

219
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.770
Surely you've been caught in
a popup trip. Definitely. And

220
00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:32.400
not so much pop ups,
but generally when things get

221
00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:34.500
out of control, you know,
you can minimize everything with

222
00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:37.680
your windows empty and then
old tab through what's there.

223
00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:39.870
Or sometimes you just go
to the task manager and

224
00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:42.810
kill it. Hello. Yep. So
you do the same thing.

225
00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:45.300
Yes. You just blow. So
the idea of going into

226
00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:47.510
task man, and figuring out
who's taking up the most,

227
00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:50.610
a CPU and just blowing
them away is a common

228
00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:54.060
thing. It's a universal. Yes.
So that's an interesting question.

229
00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:56.340
How, how can you walk
me through what that is?

230
00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:58.320
Like, I know that I
right. Click on the clock.

231
00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:01.830
I hit task manager. I
find the header for CPU

232
00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:05.550
and sort, I'm sorry. There
are always a million ways

233
00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:08.550
to do things. For example,
running task, man dot exe,

234
00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:11.310
or pressing control shift escape
will take you straight to

235
00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:14.370
the task manager. It will.
Yeah. Control, shift, escape. Say,

236
00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:17.520
I knew you would know
all the Hockeys. Yes. Many

237
00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:21.480
years of learning all this.
And then from there, it's

238
00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.190
a list. So with enlist,
you can use your first

239
00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:26.390
letter navigation to jump to
a particular thing and all

240
00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:29.310
the shortcut keys to end
and task, et cetera. How

241
00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:31.040
do you tell it's the
one using the most CPU

242
00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:33.660
cause task man moves underneath
you, you know, it's always

243
00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:38.280
updating itself. So In Vista,
they actually now give the

244
00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:41.490
column headers tab focus. So
you can tap to the

245
00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:43.770
headers and left and right
between headers and press space

246
00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:46.830
bar. Really? Yes. I, that
must have been a good

247
00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:49.020
thing. I didn't know that
For that Joel's has a

248
00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:52.170
virtual mouse and you had
to use the virtual mouse

249
00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:54.720
to virtually right. Click on,
sorry. Left click on the

250
00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:58.680
header. Really? Yeah. Which is
only three, four keystrokes, but

251
00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:01.350
It's up. Yeah. And that's
it. So then you would,

252
00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:04.770
so you can tab around
and jaws is telling you

253
00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:07.320
that you're on a column
header. Exactly. Yeah. He hits

254
00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:10.050
space. You do your sorting
ascending or descending, and then

255
00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:13.230
you blow it away with
all, all E enter. Exactly.

256
00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:17.940
Interesting. Interesting. I've got an
application right now. I'm in

257
00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:20.880
writing called baby smash. Yes.
I've been reading. Have you

258
00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:23.250
tried running baby smash? It
probably jaws would not like

259
00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:25.410
it. I don't think I
must confess. I haven't actually

260
00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:28.230
run it. It takes over
your system, you know? Yes.

261
00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:30.960
All your hot keys. And
I was trying to think

262
00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:33.570
what a low vision baby
would do with something like

263
00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:36.480
that. I think if I,
it laughs and giggles and

264
00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:39.510
it'll say the letter that
you press on, It's still

265
00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:41.280
something I'm saying that much,
but I think it would

266
00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:43.620
be great because I have
a friend who had a

267
00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:46.110
blind baby and his favorite
thing was to set a

268
00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:48.030
foot from the TV and
watch the sneaker because of

269
00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:50.850
the really bright colored balls.
So from what I've read

270
00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:54.230
about smash. Yeah. That's very
interesting. I could make a

271
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:56.510
low vision version of baby's
special because it's some WPF

272
00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:59.150
though. Yeah. I could do
do a number of things.

273
00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:02.570
That's very interesting. Yeah. Just
lots of bright colors. Now,

274
00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:06.950
a lot of times people
run applications that will basically

275
00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:09.380
sniff your website and tell
you whether or not it's

276
00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:12.530
accessible or not. How valuable
are those kinds of analyzers?

277
00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:15.280
I think they're really valuable,
valuable, as long as you

278
00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:17.720
realize they won't get you
all the way there so

279
00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:20.320
that maybe they'll get you
60, 70%. Those are my

280
00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:23.050
numbers are making out of
the way there because certain

281
00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:26.080
things like not have the
biggest problem with websites is

282
00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:29.140
people don't put their old
texts and meaningful text on

283
00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:32.120
their images. I'm, I'm guilty
of that on my own.

284
00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:35.440
Yeah. On my blog. But
yeah, 10 years, 15 years

285
00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:39.220
on, that's still the biggest
problem. And an analyzer can

286
00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:41.380
be really good at that,
but then there's always the

287
00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:45.190
human factor. Just taking something
as an old text, if

288
00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:50.020
you were to automatedly say,
put something everywhere, then you

289
00:15:50.290 --> 00:15:53.500
end up with, you know,
the space of dog gifts

290
00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:56.590
everyone has. Oh yeah. I
love that. People will sometimes

291
00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:58.630
put the word space or
there, and there's nothing more

292
00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:01.120
annoying. That's I'll leave the
site if they do that.

293
00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:04.540
Yeah. If it's something that
draws starts saying spacer. Yes,

294
00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:09.760
sir. Every single space. And
then yeah. So sometimes you

295
00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:12.460
still have empty old text
and sometimes the old text,

296
00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:15.910
how descriptive should it be?
So yeah, the automated will

297
00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:18.700
get you so far, but
humans always go the rest

298
00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:22.630
of them. How often does
something that someone implemented on

299
00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:25.510
a website in order to
make it a really pretty

300
00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:29.350
or really accessible from a
visual perspective kind of cause

301
00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:31.300
you problems. And the example
that I'm thinking of is

302
00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:33.580
that for many years I
was using a tool that

303
00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:37.540
would syntax highlight code samples
and basically just litter the

304
00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:42.910
code samples with, with tags.
So that's, It depends how

305
00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:45.250
it's done. I was actually
talking to the Scott, give

306
00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:47.950
about this. Oh yeah. She
goes, he uses code samples,

307
00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:51.370
his images. Exactly. This is
a horrible idea because I

308
00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:52.990
talked to him about this
and you know, people were

309
00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:56.890
complaining that it wasn't indented
properly and all the rest,

310
00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:59.530
when it was just done
as HTML. So he went

311
00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:01.570
to images, which is a
really good solution, except I

312
00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:05.080
couldn't read any of his
tutorials and you know, we

313
00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:07.510
had a really good laugh
over that. And that sounds

314
00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:09.460
like Kind of a sad
laugh though. I mean, do

315
00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:11.770
you think you'll change? He
definitely said that he's just

316
00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:15.250
gonna, the solution is now
he's providing links to the

317
00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:19.150
actual source code. So in
line it'll still be images,

318
00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:22.060
but there'll be links to
it. Yeah. So those files

319
00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:23.830
now I found it really
to there the solution that

320
00:17:23.830 --> 00:17:25.570
I came up with. Cause
I didn't like my markup

321
00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:27.910
being littered is now I
just have a pre tag.

322
00:17:28.570 --> 00:17:30.670
I just put the code
straight in the pre tag.

323
00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:33.490
I closed the pre, but
then I have a JavaScript,

324
00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:37.390
a utility afterwards. It looks
for all the pre tags.

325
00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:39.460
And then basically it has
a little engine on the

326
00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:42.760
client side that will syntax
highlight. That's pretty clever. Well,

327
00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:45.280
what is jaws? Does Josh
care when JavaScript starts running

328
00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:48.320
around and manipulating the Dom
like that? Not really that

329
00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:51.540
it has problems with it
updating the dome underneath it,

330
00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:56.130
but there's this phenomenon called
behavioral JavaScript, which is like

331
00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:59.610
what you said to put
a class attributes on things.

332
00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:02.340
And then after the fact
in your onload, the JavaScript

333
00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:05.540
goes and inject things into
the dome. Exactly what I'm

334
00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:08.900
doing. So I have a
pre and then I'll say

335
00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:13.850
a name equals code classical
C-sharp Exactly. Yes. And then

336
00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:17.000
that's exactly the whole bit
behavioral JavaScript thing. So that

337
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.010
would work perfectly with doors.
And does that, I mean,

338
00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:20.300
if you ended up here,
I don't know if you

339
00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:22.370
read my blog or not,
but if you noticed, if

340
00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:25.100
you have any trouble reading
my code samples. Okay, good.

341
00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:27.260
Now I feel better, but
you're saying you've kept it

342
00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:29.960
to yourself that my all
tags are, are shoddy at

343
00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:33.440
best. So I will fix
that. Yes. And I think

344
00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:37.250
in Dallas, DAS blog in
the RSS feeds, it has

345
00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:40.130
these really weird images at
the bottom of every Oh,

346
00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:43.760
okay. Yeah. So those really
weird images are actually one

347
00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:46.790
pixel gifts. I'm sorry. And
what there are, is their

348
00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:50.930
aggregator bugs basically when you
hit an item dos blog,

349
00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.390
phone's home to let you
let me know that someone

350
00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:56.450
read it. Ah, so they
should have it equals quotes,

351
00:18:56.450 --> 00:19:01.020
quotes, empty. Cause then it'll
just be ignored because yeah.

352
00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:05.000
So one time I visited
a CNN while I was

353
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.790
doing some studying of, of,
of accessibility. I did a

354
00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:10.190
view source and I noticed
that they had a tiny

355
00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:12.860
anchor tag that I had
never seen before. That said

356
00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:16.940
skip to main content. Yes.
What is this about? So

357
00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:21.230
that's some people get fanatical
about this. I don't use

358
00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:24.770
it. It's it's that you
can just press enter on

359
00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:27.320
that and it'll skip you
past all the navigation bar.

360
00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:31.070
Cause something like jaws is
gonna treat your webpage seriously,

361
00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:36.020
you'll go through. So it
linearizes the entire page Exactly.

362
00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:40.340
Especially today because everyone's using
tables and if you're first,

363
00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:41.780
you know, if you have
a left cell and a

364
00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:44.690
right cell, then the left
cell will be read first.

365
00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:48.230
Okay. So then you show
up on a cnn.com site.

366
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:50.300
And the very first thing
that has focused is the

367
00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:53.390
sh skip to main content.
You just hit space bar

368
00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:55.640
enter and then you've moved
on beyond all the ads

369
00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:59.720
and yeah, exactly. Interesting HTML
file. If I think we'll

370
00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:02.900
actually have a sidebar tag,
so that goes back to

371
00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:05.360
making it a semantic thing.
Now that's an interesting point

372
00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:08.210
that you're bringing up because
of HTML five, you've been

373
00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:10.070
surfing the web for, for
many years and you've been

374
00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:12.140
doing it, I assume all
this time as a blind

375
00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:14.540
individual. Yes. Have you noticed,
or do you have a

376
00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:17.540
sense, not just in jaws
and screen reader, technology improving,

377
00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:21.200
but is, is HTML getting
better and easier for you

378
00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:23.570
to understand going from a
table based layout with one

379
00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:26.630
pixel gifts to the semantic
web, the whole CSS, Zen

380
00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:31.280
garden style of, of development
with this? I don't know.

381
00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:34.310
And I don't think so.
The one thing to bear

382
00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:36.440
in mind is jaws. You
could consider it as a

383
00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:39.500
user agent in its own,
right. Is going through internet

384
00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:44.270
Explorer or Firefox, but it's
interpreting the dome itself. So

385
00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:48.400
as the web has changed,
so jaws has changed, do

386
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:51.250
the best it can to
make it a good experience.

387
00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:53.920
And you'll see us as
then garden that is, you

388
00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:58.000
know, the utopia, the ultimate
where web accessibility should be.

389
00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.050
But no one does that.
That brings up an interesting

390
00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:03.600
question. You know, I've been
playing with this iPhone lately

391
00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:06.300
and you know, the iPhone
is a, there's a little

392
00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:10.530
mini Safari, so it's a
full browser, but DAS blog

393
00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:12.480
and my blog have the
ability to sniff a user

394
00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:17.310
agent and apply an alternate
style sheet basically. And not

395
00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:19.770
just the style sheet, but
a complete template. The reason

396
00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:21.930
I say that is that
when I first started playing

397
00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:23.490
with the iPhone, I said,
you know, I'll sniff the

398
00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:26.430
iPhone and I'll return the
mobile version of my site.

399
00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:30.300
Okay. That means no navigation,
no sidebar, just content, content

400
00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:33.150
content. Would that be the
kind of thing that would

401
00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:36.810
be appropriate or inappropriate? Should
I detect a jaws screen

402
00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:38.940
reader and call that a
mobile site and give you

403
00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:42.270
the tiny version of my
site From my point of

404
00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:44.730
view, that would be great.
However, I was actually talking

405
00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:47.310
to some of the accessibility
people and because of privacy

406
00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:52.140
concerns, they don't pass that
information along. There's no way

407
00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:55.770
for me to tell you
visited my site. No, because

408
00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:57.540
I could tell you were
blind and then I would

409
00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:01.020
discriminate against you by giving
you lousy content. So, you

410
00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:04.590
know, from a developer's point
of view, you know, they

411
00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:07.830
folks could easily say, Oh,
someone is using the automation,

412
00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:11.370
API APIs. Let's put a
HTTP header in, but that's

413
00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:14.880
a whole privacy issue. I
never thought about that. The

414
00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:16.530
idea that it would be
a privacy issue, I guess

415
00:22:16.530 --> 00:22:18.780
it would. I mean, that
might be well, but I

416
00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:20.700
could understand that that might
be an aspect of your

417
00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:22.950
personality, that you're just not
interested in sharing The stern,

418
00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:25.950
but also I think if
you're an insurance site to

419
00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:28.470
do your online sign up,
and if someone can tell

420
00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:33.360
that you're a disabled person
wanting insurance, I mean, there's

421
00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:35.610
no, There's no deaf people
use your agent. I don't

422
00:22:35.610 --> 00:22:38.370
suppose there ought to be
a fine person user agent,

423
00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:41.970
right? No, there would be
speech recognition potentially, but not

424
00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:44.550
a really user ID. The
idea that, you know, we

425
00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:46.740
have these senses and some
of us have five and

426
00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:49.110
some have four. Does that
mean that we all get

427
00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:50.580
our own user agent? Of
course not. I mean, I

428
00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:52.950
can see the argument against
that, but I think We

429
00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:55.440
want it to have. So
because really, I know I

430
00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:58.680
have this crazy idea, which
isn't happening anytime soon that

431
00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:01.230
if you have, if all
you, you always are semantic,

432
00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:05.490
then why not have customized
user interfaces for whatever anyone

433
00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:09.210
understands likes, prefers. I mean,
I would like to provide

434
00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:12.600
the best experience possible. And
I've got this ability to

435
00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:14.790
sniff a browser. You know,
if you visit my site

436
00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:17.430
on a Blackberry, you get
the tiny version. And I

437
00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:19.620
think that that version would
be so much easier for

438
00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:22.740
a jaws screen reader. Yes,
I think it definitely works.

439
00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:24.630
I think what I'll do
is I'll just make it

440
00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:26.760
And available as a clicking
option at the bottom and

441
00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:29.580
I'll set a cookie and
if somebody hits a site

442
00:23:29.610 --> 00:23:31.260
and they want to stay
in the mobile version, then

443
00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:33.210
they can do that. That's
cool. And I think in

444
00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:35.700
the past, having a text
only version for blind people

445
00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:38.730
was frowned upon. But these
days when everything's coming from

446
00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:42.720
the same database, there's nothing
too wrong about it. I

447
00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:45.950
think with the advent of,
of skinning and theming, I

448
00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:49.280
think that the first example
that people recognize that not

449
00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:51.980
everyone wants to read your
eight point per Danna, tiny,

450
00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:55.100
tiny font was the, you
know, the adamant of those

451
00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:58.850
little, a minus a plus
buttons that sit at the

452
00:23:58.850 --> 00:24:00.770
top of a page. I
don't sure if you've seen

453
00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:02.600
these or not, but this
is the, make the font

454
00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:05.000
bigger with JavaScript or make
the font smaller with JavaScript.

455
00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:08.120
And you know, my parents
love that. Cool. My dad

456
00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:12.020
uses that. Why shouldn't there
be a, you know, click,

457
00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:13.310
if you don't want to
see any of this other

458
00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:15.830
stuff, although someone might want
to re use that to

459
00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:18.440
remove ads. Of course, I
guess that means applying people

460
00:24:18.450 --> 00:24:22.900
are impervious to two ads,
I guess. So, so I

461
00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:25.960
get the whole bit of
frame beginning and frame end

462
00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:28.450
for VM. I frames by
don't ever get to read

463
00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:30.940
the ad. So I get
almost the worst of both

464
00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:33.850
worlds. So you know, It
doesn't dig, dig into the

465
00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:35.140
eye frame and you don't
get to see all this

466
00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:40.330
flash add guard. Sure. So
with Google ads, I don't

467
00:24:40.330 --> 00:24:42.760
think I can talk a
little bit of Google out

468
00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:44.980
there, but I never find
the text from the ads

469
00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:47.260
We could be trying to
sell you something very important

470
00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:50.030
that you're missing out on
this history and, you know,

471
00:24:50.030 --> 00:24:52.150
actually all my advertisers of
having to put all tags

472
00:24:52.150 --> 00:24:54.280
on the, on the ad.
So you're probably catching those.

473
00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:59.670
Okay, interesting. So is it
possible though, to have a

474
00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:03.820
really pretty website that doesn't,
doesn't scrimp on the pretty

475
00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:04.900
on the, on the, on
the, on the, on the

476
00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:07.960
web 2.0 and the RIA
and still be really accessible?

477
00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:12.040
Absolutely. I'm really passionate that
I want to be using

478
00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:14.710
the same things, the same
really lovely user experiences that

479
00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:17.740
everyone else uses, because that
is what the mainstream web

480
00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:21.790
2.0 world is. So as
an example demo, I made

481
00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:25.510
a world map, which was
an Atlas totally in Silverlight.

482
00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:27.640
And you could hover the
mouse over the different regions

483
00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:29.860
and it would show you
a flag fluttering in the

484
00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:33.190
wind and information about that
country. And that was all

485
00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:37.240
made accessible and keyboard accessible
and actually to a blind

486
00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:40.120
person, all you'd see is
a list box of countries.

487
00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:43.120
And you might never know
that it's a pretty map,

488
00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:45.850
but it's the same thing
that anyone else would appreciate.

489
00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:48.130
You'll give us a link
to that and I'll post

490
00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:50.710
that on the, definitely on
the site. Now, if you

491
00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:52.230
don't mind my asking, how
did, how did you get

492
00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:55.810
started? How'd you get started
in computers? It's a funny

493
00:25:55.810 --> 00:25:57.220
story. So I want you
to lost my sight when

494
00:25:57.220 --> 00:26:00.730
I seven. And at that
point they decided to do,

495
00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:02.890
I was going to spend
a year learning braille and

496
00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:05.650
getting up to speed with
being blind and on top

497
00:26:05.650 --> 00:26:07.330
of that, because I had
some time left over, they

498
00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:10.300
told me to type, and
I guess I tried all

499
00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:13.780
these creative endeavors, like drawing
and woodwork, but that meant

500
00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:15.610
the teacher had to be
there. This is all, you

501
00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:17.950
know, when I was about
10 11, and I eventually

502
00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:22.120
got to writing stories, I
really liked making things which

503
00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:24.040
other people could read. It
meant a lot to me

504
00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:26.560
then. And yeah, that led
to programming when I was

505
00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:29.920
about 13. And it all
started from there. Sweet back

506
00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:32.500
creation. I mean, you want
it to produce things that

507
00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:35.680
other people could, could interact
with. Yes, that's really how

508
00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:38.170
I started. And still it's
like, I think like many

509
00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:41.080
of us developers, it's the
creative process and making new

510
00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:44.130
stuff, which is really cool.
You, accessibility is getting better.

511
00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:46.500
It sounds like you're pretty
positive in your thinking that

512
00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:51.600
it's just getting more, more
and more accessible. I'm pretty

513
00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:53.460
sure things are getting more
and more accessible, but definitely

514
00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:55.920
there's a lot more awareness.
And going back to where

515
00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:58.920
we started, the laws do
help with that. But also

516
00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:03.060
I think the world is
changing. We have RSS feeds,

517
00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:06.420
which give you data and
XML. You have a lot

518
00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:10.200
more awareness of multimodal user
interfaces. Like people are suddenly

519
00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:12.030
saying, well, we need a
keyboard interface and a touch

520
00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:14.370
and face. So to tell
them that why not have

521
00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:16.530
a voice input and a
voice output is two more

522
00:27:16.530 --> 00:27:20.430
interfaces. You know, I think
technology is helping us to,

523
00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:25.110
you know, open people's eyes,
pun intended to the different

524
00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:28.770
options and alternatives. Cool. Well,
thanks so much for sitting

525
00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:32.220
down with me today, and
this has been another episode

526
00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:34.410
of Hansel minutes and I'll
see you again next week.
