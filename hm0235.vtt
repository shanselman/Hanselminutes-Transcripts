<inaudible> From hanselminutes.com. It's Hansel
minutes, a weekly discussion with

2
00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.580
web developer and technologist Scott
Hanselman. This is Lawrence Ryan announcing

3
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:28.820
show number two 35. Recorded
live Thursday, September 30th, 2010. Support for

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.510
Hanselman. It's just provided by
Tellerik rad controls, the most

applications online@wwwdottelerik.com. In this episode,
Scott talks with Eric or

7
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.780
Branson about making your hobby
a profession. Hi, this is

8
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.090
Scott Hanselman, and this is
another episode of Hansel minutes.

9
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.040
Thinking about turning a hobby
into a company. A lot

10
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.890
of people out there go
down to the Valley and

11
00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.370
they make a lot of
money. Is it something that

12
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.590
you can do when you're
20, when you're 30, when

13
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.780
you're 40, while we've got
Eric or Branson on the

14
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.420
show, he is turning a
hobby into a company. Thanks,

15
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.060
Eric, for chatting with me.
Yeah. Thanks for having me.

16
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.210
So you have a real
job and you have this

17
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.990
side thing, is that right?
Yeah. Yeah. I, I do

18
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.310
iPhone and Android development by
day and by night, I'm

19
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.150
the, I guess the, the
mass coder of audio orchard,

20
00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.380
audio orchard. And you're changing
the name soon. So people

21
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.800
can also find it as
scratch audio, scratch out. Oh

22
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.170
yeah, we got the old,
a cease and desist letter.

23
00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.960
So there's one thing to
watch out for when you're,

24
00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.140
when you're a startup that
falls into the category of

25
00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.510
the many things you don't
know that you don't know

26
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:53.720
about legal battles, over names
is not fun. So start

27
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.090
at the beginning, you're an
iPhone developer, you're a mobile

28
00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.930
developer. And then one day
you decide people need to

29
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.370
do online audio mixing and
you pick silver light. And

30
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.910
how does it, how does
it start taking me back

31
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.780
to the beginning? Yeah, so
it really started with, with

32
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.780
a sort of off the
cuff discussion with a couple

33
00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.370
of guys I was working
with at the time. And

34
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.640
we were just talking about
things that would be fun

35
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.830
projects, things that would be
interesting. We are, I'm a

36
00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.630
little bored of the project
we had at the time.

37
00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.250
And so we were just
kind of brainstorming and we

38
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.980
started talking about audio and
what you could do there.

39
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.860
And it kinda started talking
about, well, I wonder if

40
00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.840
you could do audio in
the browser yet, if, if

41
00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.080
you know, is the technology
there. So, so we did

42
00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.520
a little digging around a
little researching and found that,

43
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.210
you know, flash and just
added some sort of low

44
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.250
level audio support that would
make that sort of thing

45
00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.140
possible. And Silverlight let me
see. Silverlight three beta had

46
00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.260
like been announced that week,
so he's started playing around

47
00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.760
with it and we started,
you know, just kinda digging

48
00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.100
into these things and it
turns out it was possible.

49
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.650
And from there it sort
of turned into almost like

50
00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.590
a dare of like, well,
who wants to actually turn,

51
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.010
who actually wants to do
this. So that's kinda how

52
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.250
it started, you know, from
there it kind of became

53
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.250
well, that's kind of interesting,
you know, it started with,

54
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.540
yeah, you can do it.
It took a couple of

55
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.400
weeks to play around and
build sort of a prototype.

56
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.460
And then it was like,
well, but who cares? Right?

57
00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.760
I mean, it's interesting to,
it's interesting to my geek

58
00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.340
friends and me that you
can, but why would anybody

59
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.160
else want to use that?
I mean, there's, there's garage

60
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.320
band, there's pro tools. There's
all sorts of things out

61
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.570
there, you know, who cares
that it's in the browser.

62
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.360
So then we sort of
talked about, well, what if,

63
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.760
if it was online, what
could you do that you,

64
00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.910
that you can't do today?
And we sort of quickly

65
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.550
landed on this idea of,
of being able to collaborate,

66
00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.030
which is something that's really
painful today. If, if you're,

67
00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.890
if you're a musician and
you want to collaborate with

68
00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.770
other people, you know, you
sort of record some tracks,

69
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:49.750
you zip them up, you
email them to somebody and

70
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.930
you wait to get stuff
back from them. It's just,

71
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.360
it's really manual. It's not
fun. And it doesn't work

72
00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.180
well. So that's kinda where,
where the project started. And

73
00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.440
from there, it just kinda
evolved and kind of lots

74
00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.550
of people I talked to
you thought it was a

75
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:05.650
great idea. And so it
kind of turned into, well,

76
00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.080
I want to turn this
into a real company. So,

77
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.430
Well, you kind of glossed
over a little middle part.

78
00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.500
There it's a lot, like
the far side cartoon with

79
00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.990
a little scientist is trying
to come up with the

80
00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.750
answer to the university's questions.
And he has like a

81
00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.900
bunch of equations and then
a miracle happens and then

82
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.960
a bunch of equations. So
you had this idea and

83
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.490
then you sat down and
a few weeks later, a

84
00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.970
prototype popped out. Had you
learned Silverlight before? I mean,

85
00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.920
your, you said you were
an Android and iPhone. Well,

86
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.100
I have actually a lot
of experience in.net. I'm doing

87
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.760
windows applications in web applications
and have done a lot

88
00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.990
of different kinds of stuff.
I hadn't done silver light

89
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.590
before I had dabbled in
some WPF stuff, you know,

90
00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.330
a couple of admin screen
kind of thing. So I

91
00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.450
didn't have a ton of
experience in it, but I

92
00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.240
really liked the technology. I
love C sharp. It's, it's

93
00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.290
one of my favorite languages
to, to work in. And,

94
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.420
you know, one of the
things early on was, you

95
00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.760
know, you, you can do
this in flash. You can

96
00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.650
do this in silver light.
You can do it in

97
00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.530
Java FX. If you want
to go that route, you

98
00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.750
know, there's there's or a
Java applet or something like

99
00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.960
that, you know? So there's
multiple routes. So there, there's

100
00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.480
kind of some discussion with,
you know, talk with a

101
00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.520
lot of people early on
about, you know, trying to

102
00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.660
come up, pick the best
technology, you know, we settled

103
00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.490
on Silverlight for, for a
couple reasons. One is, is

104
00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.460
it just the sheer performance?
You know, I guess HTML

105
00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.620
five is another one I
should throw out there. There's

106
00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.010
some low level audio stuff
you can do there. The

107
00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:40.890
performance just isn't there yet
for, you know, trying to

108
00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:45.570
process multiple tracks of audio
in real time in JavaScript

109
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.790
just didn't seem plausible. It's
just, it just doesn't have

110
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:54.750
the horsepower there. Flash suffers
a little bit from the

111
00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:59.140
same thing. There, performance isn't
quite as good from, from

112
00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.910
the characteristics and the numbers
that we were looking at

113
00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.060
and the other big one
was, was access to threading.

114
00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.180
You know, there's lots of
stuff that we wanted to

115
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.970
be able to take care
of in the background, you

116
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:13.500
know, doing various things that
we, you know, want to

117
00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.860
put on a low priority
threads, so it could get

118
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.320
done when there's time, but
don't slow down the audio

119
00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.750
processing flash didn't really have
a good way to do

120
00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:24.200
that. So those things together
kind of made us pick

121
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.970
Silverlight. And when did you
find the time to do

122
00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:29.500
this? When you have a
full time job? I mean,

123
00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.200
do you have kids and
a wife? Yeah. I got

124
00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.650
a wife and three kids,
You know, now you're just

125
00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:38.650
showing off it's one of
the things, sorry. I said

126
00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:43.120
now you're just showing off
three kids. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

127
00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.490
They're, they're a lot of
fun, but a lot of

128
00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:48.910
work. So yeah. So finding
the time is difficult, you

129
00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:52.180
know, it's, it's a lot
of after everyone goes to

130
00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:55.870
bed kind of thing. So
it's, you know, you, you,

131
00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:59.620
you tuck the kids in
you, you wait until the

132
00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:01.330
wife is tired and then
you sit down and you

133
00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.850
start coating sort of your,
your second job, if you

134
00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:06.790
will. So, so I guess
that would be one thing

135
00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:09.040
to say about, you know,
turning a hobby into a,

136
00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:12.520
into a business is it's
definitely gotta be something you're

137
00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:15.640
really committed to because it
is a massive time commitment,

138
00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:18.130
you know, make sure you've,
you've talked about it with

139
00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:21.640
your wife beforehand. Certainly one
of the mistakes I made

140
00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.950
was, you know, I got
really excited about the idea

141
00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:26.770
started coding and kind of
decided I was going to

142
00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:28.630
make this into a company.
And then, you know, Oh,

143
00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:30.220
by the way, wife, this
is going to be a

144
00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.130
big time commitment. Are you
okay with that? So, you

145
00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:34.780
know, that was some things
we had to work out

146
00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:38.080
early on in this project
and just finding a balance,

147
00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:41.530
you know, for us, it
was, you know, saying, well,

148
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:44.080
putting time caps on stuff,
we're not, you know, I

149
00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.780
won't work more than this
many nights a week, you

150
00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:49.810
know, and, you know, weekends
will work out this way

151
00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:52.660
so that there's plenty of
time for family time and

152
00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:56.560
time to work on the
project. You mind sharing how

153
00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.180
that, how that kind of
worked out. I mean, what

154
00:07:58.180 --> 00:07:59.890
did you end up coming
up with? We've had a

155
00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:02.560
couple of shows on, on
geek relationships. And I think

156
00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:05.320
both the men and women
who will listen to the

157
00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.300
show who might be interested
in turning a hobby into

158
00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:09.220
the company might want to
understand how do they make

159
00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:12.370
that negotiation with the spouse,
with the husband or wife

160
00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:16.120
about, I want to do
something that is separate from

161
00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:19.270
work and separate from family.
And it's gonna take, you

162
00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:22.450
know, 20 to 30 additional
hours a week that we

163
00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:24.910
do right now with other
stuff. I mean, how do

164
00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:26.650
you broach that and what,
what, what did you end

165
00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:30.820
up coming up with as
your compromise? So, I mean,

166
00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:34.150
the first thing is for
us, it's just talking about

167
00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:36.010
it a lot, you know,
trying to be good about,

168
00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:38.560
Hey, you know, how are
you feeling last week was

169
00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.960
kind of busy, you know,
are you doing okay? Do

170
00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.820
we, you know, should I
dial it back this week?

171
00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:45.820
And just trying to talk
about it a lot, that's

172
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.730
something I'm terrible at, but
my wife is phenomenal at,

173
00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:51.940
so I sort of am
lucky there that that's just

174
00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:55.530
what she does well, and
so that that's biggest thing

175
00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:59.010
is just constantly communicating about
it, you know, and there's

176
00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:02.850
weeks where, you know, my
wife is a, is a

177
00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.370
teacher, so there's weeks where
she's exhausted and it's just

178
00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:07.920
kind of all right, where
I'm gonna pass on, on

179
00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:10.590
working this weekend and there's
weeks where she's exhausted. And

180
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:11.940
she says, you know what,
just go ahead and work

181
00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:13.530
this week. Cause I don't
want to talk or do

182
00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:16.470
anything anyhow. So it's, it's
just kind of a lot

183
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:19.320
of playing it by ear,
you know, and then just

184
00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:22.770
sort of being proactive about
it, you know, I'm, you

185
00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:24.720
know, Hey honey, I'm I
really want to get this

186
00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:28.410
feature out by next weekend.
I think I'm gonna need,

187
00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.480
you know, six to eight
hours this weekend. Is that

188
00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:32.550
possible? Where do you think
we could schedule that in?

189
00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:35.340
And then a lot of
it is just giving up

190
00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:38.240
sleep. Yeah. I was going
to say really the only

191
00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:40.940
way to sneak more hours
out of the day is

192
00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:47.060
to steal them. Yeah, right
Before I've talked to seek

193
00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:50.060
the guy from secret geek.net,
who's known for talking about

194
00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:51.800
micro ISBNs and we did
a little bit of a

195
00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:55.640
show on micro ASVs and,
and he mentioned that programmers

196
00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:58.400
are not marketers and you
found this to be the

197
00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.920
case as well. I mean,
having a one person company

198
00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:03.380
means you're the accountant and
you're the webmaster and you're

199
00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:07.730
the programmer and you're the
marketing guy. Right? Yeah. And

200
00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:11.750
I mean, that's probably the,
the hardest thing about, you

201
00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:14.390
know, starting a company is
again, the, the, the things

202
00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:17.060
that you don't know that
you don't know and, and

203
00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:19.760
you sort of learn them
along the way. So, you

204
00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:22.430
know, I like, I imagine
like, like a lot of,

205
00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:25.130
a lot of other programmers,
you know, I I've worked

206
00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:28.330
for other companies, you know,
for, for 10 years and,

207
00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:31.400
and constantly am saying, man,
if what are these guys

208
00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.380
doing? You know, I, I
would do this so much

209
00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:35.720
better. And it's like, nah,
now that it's my job

210
00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:38.270
to actually do it. You
turns out it's, it's harder

211
00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:42.710
than you suspected, you know,
things like, like how, how

212
00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:44.390
are we going to let
people know about this? You

213
00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:48.470
know, there's sort of this
naive notion, at least for

214
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:51.220
me that, you know, Oh,
well, social, social media has

215
00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:54.020
really changed this game. And
now you just, you know,

216
00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:56.640
you create a Twitter account
and a Facebook page and,

217
00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.880
and you know, and you
build it and they come

218
00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:02.120
and it turns out that
it's harder than that. So

219
00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:05.600
it's definitely something to think
about ahead of time is,

220
00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:07.400
you know, how am I
going to let people know

221
00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:11.270
about this product? And it's,
it's gonna be harder than,

222
00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.430
you know, expect it to
be hard. And it will

223
00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:16.760
be two times harder than
that at least. And it

224
00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:19.730
seems like if I may,
with a project like yours,

225
00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:24.230
there's two audiences, there's the
looky loos. And then there's

226
00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:26.810
the people who would appreciate
it. I know that when

227
00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:30.500
I first heard about audio
orchard that I said, wow,

228
00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:33.140
a multi-track editor and Silverlight,
I need to see that,

229
00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:35.170
you know, cause I, I
thought of it in a,

230
00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:37.610
in a, wow, that's curious,
I didn't know several, I

231
00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:39.530
could do that or what
a weird thing to put

232
00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:42.680
in a browser, but you
know, other than playing with

233
00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:45.500
it for an hour, it
really wasn't, I'm not the

234
00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:49.460
target audience. So how do
you get right? The initial

235
00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:51.980
traffic of the crush of
people who want to see

236
00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:54.760
this weird new thing, know,
look at the, look at

237
00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:57.490
the elephant man and get
all that high ball traffic,

238
00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:00.310
and then turn those into
people who would actually spend

239
00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:05.130
time using the product. Yeah.
So, so luckily for me,

240
00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:09.900
there's an amazing, a really
large crossover between programmers and

241
00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:13.830
musicians. I feel like 80
to 90% of the programmers.

242
00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:16.920
I know also playing instruments.
So, so that's sort of

243
00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:19.740
a, a lucky advantage that
I have, you know, a

244
00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:22.440
lot of people will, will
show up and check it

245
00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.780
out, you know, because it
is interesting. Wow, cool. You

246
00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:27.330
can do that in a
browser and, but they're also

247
00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:29.550
musicians, so they'll stick around
and use it for awhile,

248
00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:32.760
but it's definitely, you know,
that's, that's part of the

249
00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:35.460
pro part of the, part
of that, again, learning about

250
00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:37.500
marketing and sales and how
do you, you know, how

251
00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:40.470
do you position the product?
How do you make sure

252
00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:42.030
that you've pitched it in
such a way that people

253
00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:46.470
understand, Oh, this isn't just
neat tech look cool. Interesting.

254
00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:48.540
And then go away. How
do you present it in

255
00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:50.760
such a way that people
kind of see it as

256
00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:53.640
something that actually solves a
pain point for them? You

257
00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.860
know, something that, Oh yeah,
it is, it is really

258
00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:58.260
frustrating that I record a
song and I'd like my

259
00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.140
buddy from, you know, some
other state to lay down

260
00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:03.000
a guitar track and how
do I get them to

261
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.370
do that? And you know,
how do I, you know,

262
00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:08.370
in that maybe one minute
that I have that, you

263
00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:12.030
know, that, that somebody looks
for, for, for the technical

264
00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:15.390
geek reasons, let them know
that it's more than just

265
00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:18.030
that, you know, and that's
very much a learning process.

266
00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:20.460
That's, you know, things I'm
figuring out as I go

267
00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:22.890
along. And it's, it's a
lot of talking to people

268
00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:25.050
who have tried it out
and finding out, you know,

269
00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:27.840
did you catch that? It
also does this, you know,

270
00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:31.530
and then just trying to
improve it, watch people use

271
00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:34.770
it and try and improve
it. Have you done any

272
00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:38.790
actual marketing? You know, I've
done a little bit of

273
00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:42.870
experimenting with some, some pay-per-click,
but for the most part,

274
00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:46.290
you know, marketing, you know,
when you, when you're starting

275
00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:50.490
your own business on, unless
you're independently wealthy, in which

276
00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:52.950
case you're, you're probably not
doing what I'm trying to

277
00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:56.400
do. You know, you, you
don't have a ton of

278
00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:00.000
cash to do marketing. So,
so it really is another

279
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.980
one of those terms. You,
you learn when you start,

280
00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:05.460
start trying to do this
as guerrilla marketing, and that's

281
00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:08.790
the idea of the sort
of low cost grassroots kind

282
00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:11.370
of marketing it's, you know,
trying to get people to

283
00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:14.010
blog about it, get people
to, you know, to it's

284
00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:16.530
all the social media stuff,
getting people to Twitter about

285
00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:18.360
it, tweet about it. Wow.
I can't believe I said

286
00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:21.240
Twitter. That's so not like
a marketer. Give me, I

287
00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:24.360
know, I know I like
dropped to two points on

288
00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:28.440
the geek scale right there.
Hi, this is Scott coming

289
00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:30.870
to you from another place
in time. Are you using

290
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:33.960
agile practices to manage your
software development? There's lots of

291
00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:35.790
tools in the market that
manage the steps of a

292
00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:39.240
project, but most of them
focus on individual roles. Get

293
00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:41.250
ready for a solution that
caters for the success of

294
00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:44.880
the whole team. Guys at
Tellerik introduced team pulse. It's

295
00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:47.940
an agile project management tool.
That'll help you gather ideas,

296
00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:52.730
estimate plan, track progress in
a common workspace. Finally companies,

297
00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:55.010
regardless of their size can
use a lightweight and convenient

298
00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:57.260
tool that makes all the
stakeholders work as a United

299
00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:01.490
team. Even if they're in
different countries by combining intuitive

300
00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:04.370
user interface and the power
server light team poles removes

301
00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:07.010
the roadblocks that you typically
face and applying agile in

302
00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:10.400
an effective manner, no more
lost data, no disparate systems,

303
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.270
no lack of critical analytics
regarding the health and philosophy

304
00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:17.720
project. See if yourself get
a free copy for five

305
00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:24.200
users in one project at
tellerik.com/team Pauls. And please do

306
00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:27.020
thank tolerant for supporting Hansel
minutes on their Facebook fan

307
00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:33.440
page, facebook.com/t L E R
I K. Telework. We do

308
00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:35.570
appreciate it. There wouldn't be
a Hanselman. If there wasn't,

309
00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:39.110
Tellerik helping us. Is there
something that you sit down

310
00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:41.330
and task out? Because I
have found in my experience

311
00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:45.350
of programmers are extremely good
at laying out a discreet

312
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:48.950
task. If that discrete task
is get this feature running

313
00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:52.760
or set up a continuous
integration server, but do guerrilla

314
00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:57.500
marketing rarely gets written down.
So I'm, I'm curious and

315
00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:59.960
I'm kind of pinning you
down a little bit. Did

316
00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:02.840
you say all right, it's
Tuesday, I'm gonna do three

317
00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:05.720
hours of, of marketing work
or is this something that's

318
00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:09.770
organic? And if so, as
I suspect it might be,

319
00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:11.600
do you think that might
hold you back a little

320
00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:15.520
bit? Yeah, no, there's no
question that it holds me

321
00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:19.150
back. It's, you know, honestly,
it's, it's one of the

322
00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:21.190
most difficult things is, you
know, when you have a

323
00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:24.010
limited, you've got a limited
amount of time, right? There's

324
00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:25.930
only so many hours you
can quit, can put into

325
00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:27.820
this thing. So I've, you
know, let's say I've got

326
00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:30.610
three hours. I can work
on something tonight and I

327
00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:32.860
can either put it into
some sort of guerrilla marketing,

328
00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:36.010
which is something I don't
necessarily know how to do.

329
00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:38.560
And it's a little more
in the touchy feely side,

330
00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:41.350
or I can program features
X, Y, and Z, and

331
00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:44.080
have them done and test
it and working. And it's

332
00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:46.480
really easy to go. Well,
I'm going to do the

333
00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:48.880
features because I know what
I'm going to get in

334
00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:52.450
my three hours for that.
And, and so it's really,

335
00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:56.800
it becomes a process of,
you know, just telling yourself,

336
00:16:56.830 --> 00:16:59.620
Nope, I'm going to tonight
is marketing night. And so

337
00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:01.960
I'm going to put effort
into that. And the other

338
00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:05.800
thing is, you know, find
partners it's, it's, it's not

339
00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:07.870
the kind of thing you
can do by yourself, most

340
00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:13.420
likely. So find, you know,
find somebody who's, who's interested

341
00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:15.820
in the marketing side, who's
interested in what you're doing.

342
00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:18.340
You know, if, if the,
if the company you're trying

343
00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:20.920
to build is, is, has
any chance of succeeding, it's,

344
00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:24.220
it's gotta be interesting to
people. So find somebody with

345
00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:28.180
a marketing, marketing, bent, who's,
who's interested in it and,

346
00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:30.730
you know, give them some
equity and, and, and get

347
00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:32.860
them involved and let them
start moving down that path.

348
00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:34.660
And that's, that's what I've
had to do. And it's,

349
00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:40.330
that's been a huge help.
Have you found any, have

350
00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:42.040
you found any partners and
if so, where did you

351
00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:44.050
look for them? Did you
look at that local user

352
00:17:44.050 --> 00:17:48.010
group, or did you find
any college interns? You know,

353
00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:51.780
I, I found any college
interns. I've, I've toyed around

354
00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:56.460
with that idea. You know,
for me, I spent, I

355
00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:59.280
spent a lot of months
just working by myself, just

356
00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:01.140
kind of trying to get
the basic idea all in

357
00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:05.730
place. And before I started
looking for anyone else, I

358
00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:07.850
did find once I sort
of got the initial beta

359
00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:10.230
out there, I had an
old friend who used to

360
00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:14.040
write guitar effects for fender
guitars, and I was able

361
00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:16.200
to get him involved. So
that's been huge. He's got

362
00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:19.140
a lot more of the
low level, you know, writing

363
00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:22.110
EQs and low pass filters
and these types of things

364
00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:24.060
that I don't know anything
about. So that's been huge

365
00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:27.120
from a technical standpoint, but
also once I kinda got

366
00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:29.910
it out there and was
able to start kind of

367
00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:32.550
showing it around, I guess
one thing that was really

368
00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:36.510
interesting is there's a, a
huge startup community in my

369
00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:39.420
town. I live in Phoenix
and it seems to be

370
00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:42.510
that that's true everywhere. So,
you know, it's, it's finding

371
00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:45.060
those, like you said, user
groups and those, you know,

372
00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:48.900
those groups of people in
your town meeting with them,

373
00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:51.780
talking to them. And through
that, as you know, I

374
00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:54.990
attended a user group where
someone who was speaking, showed

375
00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:57.420
them my product, he got
really excited about it. And,

376
00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:00.240
you know, he's, he's been
helping with the marketing and

377
00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:04.380
sort of a biz dev
side of things. And how,

378
00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:08.210
how is it going? I
mean, well, let's just be

379
00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:10.220
Frank. At what point will
the wife call it a

380
00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:15.470
success? You know, the, the
wife will call it a

381
00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:18.440
success when, when she gets
a vacation out of it,

382
00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:20.540
out of the, out of
the cash brought in, I

383
00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:22.190
think that's when it will
be a success for her,

384
00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:26.480
for me, you know, it'll
be, it'll be a success

385
00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:31.070
when, when it, when it
becomes a profitable. So that's

386
00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:32.870
still a little ways out
for us, but it's, you

387
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:36.590
know, it's, we're, we're making
slow, slow progress. You know,

388
00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:40.130
that's another thing about starting,
starting the company, it's a

389
00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:43.610
long road and it's, it's,
it's, you know, expected to

390
00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:45.590
take a long time. And,
and again, it's going to

391
00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:48.860
take two times longer than
that. So, you know, it's

392
00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:51.560
not, there's, there's a few
of those that hidden are

393
00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:56.750
instantly successful. It probably won't
be you. What are your,

394
00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:59.120
where are your primary costs
that most people who think

395
00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:01.430
about startups are either going
to sell an application and

396
00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:04.430
an app store, or like
you're doing, which is selling

397
00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:08.300
an application slash service that's
in the cloud somewhere. Where

398
00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:11.120
are your costs where your
primary costs, other than your,

399
00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:16.610
your family, your familial costs.
Right. You know, for me,

400
00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:18.860
hosting is, is kind of
a big one. Although that's

401
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:24.050
been rectified, I had hosting.com
actually gave us a really

402
00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:28.460
good deal and basically eliminated
our costs also. And I

403
00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:31.880
should, should mention we're a
part of the BizSpark program.

404
00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:34.160
And that helped drop a
lot of our costs too.

405
00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:37.340
Cause I covered all our,
all our licenses for, you

406
00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:40.220
know, sequel and I S
and everything we needed. So

407
00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:43.220
that's, that's been a huge
help. You worry about the,

408
00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:46.190
the spark programs, because they'll,
they'll, the idea is for

409
00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:49.030
those who may not be
familiar with those programs is

410
00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:52.690
that Microsoft gives you licenses
for the first three years

411
00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:55.660
to get your startup started.
And then three months later,

412
00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:58.450
presumably if you're a startup
is still around, then they

413
00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:02.170
start to charge you. Yeah.
That makes your cost of

414
00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:03.580
your own now. But do
you feel that they're going

415
00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:08.220
to get you later? Well,
so you get three years

416
00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:11.730
and in the startup world,
that's probably, that's, that's a

417
00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:15.330
long time. So in three
years, either, either you're a

418
00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:18.900
wild success and the license
costs are a nonissue at

419
00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:21.990
that point, or you've given
it your best shot and

420
00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:25.590
it's not working and you're
probably done. So, you know,

421
00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:30.330
it's got a very nominal,
nominal exit fee. I think

422
00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:33.090
it's a hundred dollars after
three years, but you get

423
00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:35.160
to also keep all the
licenses you had, you just

424
00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:39.420
no longer get to, you
know, new licenses to everything

425
00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:42.540
that comes out. Oh, I
see. So you didn't feel

426
00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:44.370
to bait and switch. Do
you don't feel like they're

427
00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:47.690
coming, they're coming for you
in three years? No. No.

428
00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:49.800
It, it very much felt
like a no brainer to

429
00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:52.530
me. I mean, a hundred
dollars in three years is,

430
00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:57.090
is makes it a total
non-issue, it's something to not

431
00:21:57.090 --> 00:21:59.430
worry about compared to everything
else I have on my

432
00:21:59.430 --> 00:22:02.060
plate that I do worry
about. So, Well, I I'm

433
00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:04.650
interested in that because you
are a, as a mobile

434
00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:08.250
person who sells things in
an app store, as well

435
00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:12.240
as this model where there
is no app store, you

436
00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:15.570
know, the, the, the model
in the Apple world is

437
00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:18.570
isn't it like Baya spend
a hundred dollars on the,

438
00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:22.110
to get into the marketplace
at that point, that's pretty

439
00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:26.400
much it. Well, no, the
Apple, world's a little different,

440
00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:29.250
you, you actually have to,
yeah. You have to buy,

441
00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:32.040
buy in to be able
to put things into the,

442
00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:35.520
into the marketplace. So you're
paying, it's still a fairly

443
00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.410
nominal, I think it's a
hundred dollars as well. So

444
00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:39.240
it's about the same price.
Just you're paying it up

445
00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:42.990
front instead of at the
edge, Except that their, their

446
00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:47.400
developer tools are free. Their
developer tools are free, but

447
00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:50.760
again, through the BizSpark program,
but the developer tools, our

448
00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:54.840
licenses are also covered. So
I have visual studio licenses

449
00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:57.600
for me. And the couple
of guys that are working

450
00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:01.320
with me. And how are
you, how do you deal

451
00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:04.350
with other guys bringing in
other people, other guys, and

452
00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:06.780
gals bringing them into the
project. When you have a

453
00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:11.070
company that is in the
garage, do you say, I'll

454
00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:13.950
give you 1% of nothing,
or do you, do you

455
00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:16.650
give them beer and chips?
What do you pay them

456
00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:20.130
in a, You pay them
an equity. So it's, you

457
00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:23.280
know, some, some percentage of
the company, which basically is,

458
00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:26.970
you know, is worth nothing
at this point, but, you

459
00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:28.680
know, for both of them,
for the, both the guys

460
00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:31.260
that I'm working with, you
know, they're, they believe in

461
00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:34.980
the product, you know, you
know, they're, they're, especially the,

462
00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:38.640
you know, the, the guy
who's the, from fender, he's

463
00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:40.950
just, he just loves something
to work on that, you

464
00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:45.060
know, is, is, is around
processing audio. So for him,

465
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:48.710
you know, it's much like
me, it's, it's a hobby.

466
00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:51.080
If the business side completely
fails, it's still a fun

467
00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:54.260
hobby. So, you know, so
there's that, and then the

468
00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:56.630
equity is, you know, hopefully
this does take off. And

469
00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:59.360
at that point, you know,
there's a cash payout as

470
00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:03.310
well. So all the better.
Do you think that if

471
00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:06.700
this whole thing went South
and it just became a

472
00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:11.230
hobby, that that would be
really okay. You have such

473
00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:13.990
great. It would be, I
mean, it would be usually

474
00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:17.170
disappointing, but it would, you
know, it would still have

475
00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:20.230
been a very fun project.
And there's been, there's been

476
00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:22.090
a lot of really great
things that have come out

477
00:24:22.090 --> 00:24:24.370
of this for me, you
know, I've got to meet

478
00:24:24.370 --> 00:24:26.080
a lot of cool people.
I've got to be on

479
00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:30.160
some cool podcasts. And so
it's, it's been, it's had

480
00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:32.770
a lot of, it's had
a lot of advantages that

481
00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:35.950
would make it not a
complete loss if the thing

482
00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:40.120
went belly up. So switching
gears to the, to the

483
00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:45.040
technical, you're doing raw audio
processing in the browser inside

484
00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:48.310
of Silverlight. Did you ever
think you would hit a,

485
00:24:48.550 --> 00:24:51.630
hit a wall with that
you'd want to make, why,

486
00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:55.030
why in the browser and
why not a chubby client,

487
00:24:56.020 --> 00:25:00.070
Right. Yeah. Well, so as
I kind of alluded to

488
00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:04.990
a little bit earlier, you
know, there there's, there's hundreds,

489
00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:08.680
if not thousands of people
who make, you know, fat

490
00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:14.740
client installed applications for, for
multi-track recording, just didn't feel

491
00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:18.040
there was any chance of
breaking into that market. So

492
00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:21.340
kind of felt to do
this. We'd have to have

493
00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:24.520
something very, very distinct and
different about what we are

494
00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:27.040
doing. So putting it in
the browser and making it

495
00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:30.670
a highly collaborative tool, we
kind of felt like gave

496
00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:33.790
us a distinguisher that a
lot of these fat clients

497
00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:35.950
couldn't quickly jump to, you
know, it, wasn't the kind

498
00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:38.140
of thing where it's just
an additional feature they could

499
00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:41.080
quickly add. And then again,
we'd have no distinguisher. So

500
00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:44.710
that was really important early
on was, was that, that

501
00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:46.450
we had something like that.
So that was the idea.

502
00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:51.220
There were definitely concerns about,
you know, how, how possible

503
00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:52.960
would this be? And would
we hit some point where,

504
00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:56.410
Oh, you just can't do
that. You know? And there's

505
00:25:56.410 --> 00:25:58.480
still concerns about that, but
I guess those are some

506
00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:00.850
of the risks you, you
kinda just have to take,

507
00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:04.720
you know, we did enough
prototyping up front that it,

508
00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:07.360
it was a calculated risk,
I guess. And, and we

509
00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:10.090
knew what we were risking
and we felt pretty, pretty

510
00:26:10.090 --> 00:26:13.360
good about, about the possibility
that it would work. And

511
00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:16.120
so far it's worked really
well. So you haven't hit,

512
00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:18.220
I mean, what kind of
technical challenges have you hit

513
00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:21.190
where you thought that that
was the wall like, Oh,

514
00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:23.800
we just hit it, that's
it, you can't do XYZ

515
00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:28.090
in several lines. You know,
there's still a little concerned

516
00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:32.320
about a few different types
of, of microphones, especially people

517
00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:36.550
who have these, you know,
massive banks, you know, that

518
00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:39.280
something that has 16 audio
channels coming in and will

519
00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:41.500
we be able to pull
all 16 of those so

520
00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:45.090
they can record 16 tracks
at one time, it looks

521
00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:46.800
like it's going to be
possible, but we haven't, we

522
00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:49.860
haven't gotten there yet, but
you know, you make contingency

523
00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:52.860
plans. So we're S worst
case scenario. We do some

524
00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:56.820
sort of additional active X
control for IAE and some

525
00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:59.850
in a Firefox plugin that,
that we can then talk

526
00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:01.950
to that can, can get
down to that low level.

527
00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:05.190
Again, those are sort of
more of the edge case

528
00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:08.520
people. So, you know, it's
less than ideal, but, you

529
00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:10.170
know, those are the things
where we kind of go,

530
00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:12.750
man, I really hope, I
really hope that works out.

531
00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:16.710
And just being up against
the CPU, you know, it's,

532
00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:20.760
it's pretty intensive trying to
deal with 10 tracks of,

533
00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:25.590
you know, 44.1 kilohertz audio
and putting multiple effects on

534
00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:28.470
each track and combining them
all and keeping it in,

535
00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:32.550
in real close enough to
real time that people, you

536
00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:36.900
know, don't, don't that it's
usable, you know, it's, it's

537
00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:40.230
a constant battle. And, you
know, in fact, we, at

538
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:42.750
our last release, we, we,
or maybe it was two

539
00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:44.820
releases ago. Now, we, we
ran into a problem with

540
00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:47.730
that where we, we put
out our, our, our version.

541
00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:50.040
And all of a sudden
there were all these, you

542
00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:53.640
know, the performance had was,
you know, most people, CPS

543
00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:55.410
were being pegged and we
couldn't figure out what we

544
00:27:55.410 --> 00:27:57.720
had done that had changed
that. And man, that is

545
00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:00.060
a horrible feeling. You're just
like, what about that feature?

546
00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:03.400
We just added it is
breaking the CPU. And it

547
00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:05.820
turned out after we, we
messed around with it for

548
00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:09.840
awhile, we had changed, we
had changed something so that

549
00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:13.140
there was a blur effect
on, on the sort of

550
00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:16.380
the root, the root element
that was normally set to

551
00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:19.380
zero blur. But when we
did some certain transitions, we'd

552
00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:21.780
sort of, you know, we,
we would use a transition

553
00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:24.330
to, to blur, to sort
of do a blur effect.

554
00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:27.030
Well, that was causing the
entire screen to have to

555
00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:30.120
redraw every frame. So you're
trying to redraw the entire

556
00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:32.940
screen at 60 frames a
second, and that's not so

557
00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:36.380
good for your CPU. How
long did it take you

558
00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:41.360
to figure that out? It
took, let me think. A

559
00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:44.390
couple of nights of dabbling
around, you know, it started

560
00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:47.210
with removing the, the, the
feature that I thought was

561
00:28:47.210 --> 00:28:49.370
the problem only to realize
that made no difference. And

562
00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:52.550
then you sort of started
stripping stuff away, and none

563
00:28:52.550 --> 00:28:56.450
of the audio stuff made
a difference. So eventually just

564
00:28:56.450 --> 00:29:00.320
happened to turn on there's
some really cool development things.

565
00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:02.870
You can, you can turn
on the redraw rectangles. I

566
00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:05.900
forget exactly what it's called,
but it basically shows you

567
00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:08.180
visually on the screen, what
part of the screen is

568
00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:12.350
being redrawn. And the entire
screen just started lighting up

569
00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:15.680
and is one big block
of giant redraw. And so

570
00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:18.530
then it was a matter
of removing things from the,

571
00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:21.020
from the visual tree until
that stopped. And then it

572
00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:23.720
was once we found it,
it was really obvious. Oh,

573
00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:26.450
of course, a blur even
at zero is causing the

574
00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:29.510
entire screen to redraw. So
we just had to rethink

575
00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:31.910
how we did that. And
then it wasn't a hard

576
00:29:31.910 --> 00:29:35.870
fix once we found it.
So you've said that the,

577
00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:39.680
the thing that would allow
you to be distinguished, distinguished

578
00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:42.370
from the, the other multi-track
editors out there was the

579
00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:45.190
fact that you're online. So
other than the fact that

580
00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:48.280
you're inside the browser, what
is it that you do

581
00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:52.950
that is, that is unique.
Yeah. So, so we store

582
00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:56.940
then all the audio files
that you record on our

583
00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:59.550
server. So what that means
is, you know, if you

584
00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:02.550
record part of a song,
you can, you can invite

585
00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:06.690
your friend or whoever it
might be to, to participate.

586
00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:09.210
They basically get a link
and they can just show

587
00:30:09.210 --> 00:30:12.990
up. It'll automatically, you know,
download everything to their computer

588
00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:14.700
so they can work with
it all right there. So

589
00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:17.850
it solves a bunch of
problems that, that, that musicians

590
00:30:17.850 --> 00:30:21.270
have today in terms of
just one is, you know,

591
00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:24.300
this is a free tool
at this point, you know,

592
00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:26.490
you don't have to worry
about, Oh, I've got garage

593
00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:29.340
band and you have pro
audio. You know, it, we

594
00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:31.500
can use the same tool.
It's, you know, because it's,

595
00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:36.060
Silverlight, it's cross platform, which
not a lot of, of

596
00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:38.550
the audio tools out there
today are, you know, it

597
00:30:38.550 --> 00:30:41.340
just, it makes it really
easy to invite people to

598
00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:44.070
manage, you know, this person
can, can access this part.

599
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:47.370
This person isn't allowed to
work with it as well

600
00:30:47.370 --> 00:30:49.230
as we make it really
easy then for when people

601
00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:52.110
are done to, you know,
easily share this to, to,

602
00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:55.650
to Facebook and Twitter, and
then let you know, let

603
00:30:55.650 --> 00:30:59.070
people, let their, let people
share it to their existing

604
00:30:59.070 --> 00:31:01.470
sort of fan base, which
is, you know, my set

605
00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:04.470
of friends who will care
about my music, you know,

606
00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:07.050
and then from there, we,
we let those people, and

607
00:31:07.050 --> 00:31:08.670
this is actually gonna be
coming in our next version,

608
00:31:08.670 --> 00:31:11.700
but we let those people
sort of make remixes, you

609
00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:15.270
know, so again, since we're
storing all this data, you

610
00:31:15.270 --> 00:31:19.290
know, somebody, I don't want
anonymous person a to come

611
00:31:19.290 --> 00:31:21.660
in and tweak with my
song, but I don't mind

612
00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:24.150
if they can sort of
make a full fledged copy

613
00:31:24.150 --> 00:31:25.890
and tweak with that, all
they want, as long as

614
00:31:25.890 --> 00:31:28.920
it doesn't affect my song.
So that's some of where

615
00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:31.350
we're trying to go with
this, that sort of things,

616
00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:33.600
that existing tools just don't
have a way to do

617
00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:36.870
that we think will be
really exciting. It sounds a

618
00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:40.380
little bit like get hub
for music. Yeah. Yeah. That's

619
00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:43.380
exactly a lot of people
make that comparison on another

620
00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:45.600
one. A lot of people
call us the Google docs

621
00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:50.880
for music. And is this
something where you can edit

622
00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:54.180
as well? Or how, how,
how prepared does the audio

623
00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:58.620
file have to be before
it's uploaded Today? Any wave

624
00:31:58.620 --> 00:32:02.010
file will work. You know,
eventually we'll, we'll be adding

625
00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:06.120
MP3s and a hand, a
handful of other formats, but

626
00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:09.660
yeah, any way file you
can upload, we, we have

627
00:32:09.690 --> 00:32:12.270
a partnership with a loop
company, so there's a, a

628
00:32:12.270 --> 00:32:14.850
thousand free loops in there
that you can use completely

00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:17.310
royalty free today. So, you
know, if you show up

630
00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:19.050
and you want to get
started, you know, there's a

631
00:32:19.050 --> 00:32:20.910
lot there for you to
play with in terms of,

632
00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:22.950
you know, just basic drum
beats and stuff to start

633
00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:26.010
recording against. And, you know,
and then any, any microphone

634
00:32:26.010 --> 00:32:28.290
that shows up as a,
as a audio device on

635
00:32:28.290 --> 00:32:32.630
your, on your computer will,
will work for recording on,

636
00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:34.470
and you can record that
and it all gets uploaded

637
00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:37.290
to our server. And can
I, can you trim and

638
00:32:37.290 --> 00:32:41.900
edit afterwards? Yup. Yup. And
That's something we just added

639
00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:43.550
in our last release. So
you can not, you know,

640
00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:46.520
if something's not lined up
quite right, you can move

641
00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:48.980
it. You can trim the
beginning and the end of

642
00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:51.050
the, you know, if you
hear a mouse click at

643
00:32:51.050 --> 00:32:52.730
the end or whatever, or
you made a mistake at

644
00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:55.010
some point, you can sort
of trim that out. There's

645
00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:57.620
a lot more coming in
in that area, but yeah,

646
00:32:57.620 --> 00:32:59.870
it's, it's, it's, you know,
it's the goal is to

647
00:32:59.870 --> 00:33:04.570
be a very full featured
multi-track recorder. Oh, very cool.

648
00:33:04.570 --> 00:33:07.150
Maybe we'll do you have
any podcasts that are editing

649
00:33:07.150 --> 00:33:10.450
up there? We, that would
be great. We haven't seen

650
00:33:10.450 --> 00:33:13.240
any of that yet, but
it's definitely, it's definitely doable.

651
00:33:13.630 --> 00:33:15.370
Cool. Maybe some of the
listeners will check it out.

652
00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:19.390
So right now you're at
audio orchard.com in the next

653
00:33:19.390 --> 00:33:22.900
few weeks, as you make
your legally required name change,

654
00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:25.780
what's the best way for
people to find you. We

655
00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:29.290
will be scratch audio.com, but
we'll hold on to the

656
00:33:29.290 --> 00:33:32.620
audio orchard domain and forward
it on. So either one

657
00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:35.950
should work for that for
the foreseeable future. Very cool.

658
00:33:36.010 --> 00:33:38.500
