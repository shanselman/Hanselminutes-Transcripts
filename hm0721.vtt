00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.970
Hey friends, I want to
welcome a new sponsor, text

2
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.590
control.com. It's really amazing stuff.
Text control is a deep

3
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.430
functionality component vendor. They're the
creators of TX text control.

4
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.120
It's a word inspired document
editor library. It's a document

5
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.920
processing engine for your apps.
It's fully customizable, fully programmable,

6
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.940
and it's available for most
platforms. That means asp.net, MVC,

7
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.680
web forms, windows forms, WPF.
Recently, they actually released an

8
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.180
angular and no JS version
so they can integrate their

9
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.280
Wiziwig document editing into your
web applications. Now, a typical

10
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.440
application for this would be
like mail merge or a

11
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.440
blog or somewhere where like
an ms word compatible template

12
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.110
gets merged, you know, with
some Jason data on the

13
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.110
client or even pure service
side apps where you can

14
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.470
create an Adobe PDF document.
It's really amazing. And what

15
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:53.850
I love about it is
that you can go and

16
00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.360
check out a live demo,
text control.com/demos, text control.com. It

17
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.800
is a full, like basically
word in your browser. Documented

18
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.030
in creation, collaboration on any
platform. Really, really easy for.net

19
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.550
folks to integrate. I was
really impressed and I'm really

20
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:27.480
happy to have them as
a sponsor. Alright, this is

21
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.180
Scott Hanselman. This is another
episode of Hansel minutes. Today.

22
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.910
I'm talking with Yvonne Marcus,
she's the host of your

23
00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.600
agile home podcast that helps
you develop flexible home management

24
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.230
solutions. How are you? How
are you? I am very

25
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.410
well. And I'm excited to
chat with you. You and

26
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.190
I are both podcasters and
we are also parents. I,

27
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.040
of course you folks know
I work from home. So

28
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.500
at some point the boys
will burst in, in the

29
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.290
middle and interrupt this podcast
and probably cause all kinds

30
00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.020
of trouble. So I'm always
interested in new ways to,

31
00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.340
to parent. And you have
some ideas around that. Oh,

32
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:06.230
absolutely. I, I am so
excited about using agile at

33
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:11.000
home because I found that
just asking my kids for

34
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.040
solutions to their own problems,
opened us up to a

35
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.250
world. I didn't even know
existed inside their heads. How

36
00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.930
do we do things now?
Or are we just doing

37
00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.340
waterfall style project management with
our lives at home? Absolutely.

38
00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.430
I believe that parenting is
sort of the last great

39
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.120
waterfall. Like it just kind
of keeps going. It's been

40
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.570
kind of parents telling kids
what to do and then

41
00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.670
kids following through or often
not following through with the

42
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.690
instructions because you know, how
many times have you told

43
00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.910
your kids to go put
their laundry in the hamper?

44
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:52.070
And it's not happened Every
single time. Yeah. And that,

45
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.890
that sort of continues to
happen when I'm using agile,

46
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.460
but it'll at least now
I know that like moving

47
00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.370
the laundry to a different
location solved that problem, 75%

48
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.420
of the time. Okay. So
are you, is this a

49
00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.120
fail fast fail often thing?
Cause I have the fail

50
00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.490
fast fail often part down
where everything is just a

51
00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.790
big pile of fail at
this point. That happens quite

52
00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.870
a bit. Yes. But we
do find active solutions to

53
00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.260
problems, which is, which is
good. But yes, we do

54
00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.160
fail a lot and hard,
but the good news is,

55
00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.610
is that that failure then
creates that feedback loop. That's

56
00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.910
so important to be able
to move on to a

57
00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.500
new solution quickly. And I
find that the quickly is

58
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.300
the biggest, most important thing
because you know, if you

59
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.750
sit there and you're like
this solution, this problem doesn't

60
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.860
have a solution. And you
just keep living with the

61
00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.660
system that you're using. Now,
if you kind of are

62
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.830
married to that, then you
start to feel like a

63
00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.430
failure or like you're a
bad parent instead of coming

64
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.180
up with a solution that
actually works and then being

65
00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.640
able to feel good about
that problem being Right. We've

66
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.680
talked about this on the
podcast before the idea of

67
00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.410
letting life happen by default
and we all get overwhelmed

68
00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.090
and it's okay to be
overwhelmed, whether it be in

69
00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.060
your personal life, if you
don't have kids or if

70
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.820
kids are in your life,
like they are in ours,

71
00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:24.510
if you just do nothing,
that is a decision that

72
00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.530
is the default and the
default is, is waterfall. And

73
00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.860
it's just kind of like
slowly dealing with these things

74
00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.620
and letting things happen. But
you, if we back up

75
00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.900
a little bit, have a
background in operations and business

76
00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.870
operations and basically getting, getting
things done in business. And

77
00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.210
then when you went to
be a stay at home

78
00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.170
mom slash CEO home systems,
strategist, right? You have a

79
00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:49.080
business to manage. You also
have these little, these small

80
00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.930
people to manage. What made
you say I'm going to

81
00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.320
go and take those operations
skills and agile and apply

82
00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.850
it to that, the management
of the house, Because you

83
00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.820
are running a small business,
whether you like to think

84
00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.690
of it that way or
not, you are running a

85
00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.630
house and it has to
be ran in a way

86
00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:15.360
that is efficient and that
works. And that, you know,

87
00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:22.290
just sort of manages different
personalities, manages different people's time

88
00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:27.300
constraints and just different people's
strengths and weaknesses. Because one

89
00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.500
of the things I like
to talk about is like

90
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.430
chores. When you give your
kids chores and you just

91
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.730
assign them Willy nilly, it
might not be something that

92
00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:37.770
is like their strong suit
at there or that they're

93
00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.980
going to do well. Whereas
if you sit down with

94
00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.840
the list of all the
chores that are done in

95
00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:48.300
your house, Hi friend, aye.
Hey buddy, I'm doing a

96
00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:55.920
show right now. Okay. Thank
you friend. I told you

97
00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.340
that would happen, but this
is the one show I

98
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.700
won't have to edit that
out of because the boys

99
00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:04.270
just got home from school
and ignored the light. Yeah,

100
00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:09.430
of course Their strengths, right.
Is the idea Into their

101
00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:13.870
strengths, letting them self assign
tasks. I mean, even as

102
00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.870
adults, their chores, we don't
like to do. Right. And

103
00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.810
we don't have to do
them. We should know how.

104
00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:22.000
And I think that kids
should learn how to like

105
00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:24.850
unload the dishwasher. But if
they're going to break all

106
00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:27.430
of your dishes, because they're
just not thinking about it

107
00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:30.250
and they're just kind of
Willy nilly, throwing things places,

108
00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:32.530
is it really something that
you want them to do?

109
00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:36.760
Longterm Your skill. You have
to have a, a one

110
00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.670
on one with HR and
the employee or the child

111
00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:41.830
and say, this is a
skill that we don't think

112
00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:43.660
you have right now. We're
going to assign that to

113
00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:47.170
someone else. Exactly. And then
I, you know, you just

114
00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:49.450
kind of let them decide
what they're going to be

115
00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:52.270
good at right now. And
then you teach them how

116
00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:54.850
to do all of the
things. But in life we

117
00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:57.460
are not set up so
that like I have to

118
00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:01.420
cook dinner every night. And
that's probably the real reason

119
00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:05.530
I started this business is
because to me, the problem

120
00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:10.180
in parenting has been overall
in society. We expect mom

121
00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:13.390
to be in charge of
hashtag all the things. Right.

122
00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:15.700
I think being at home
is a largely gendered thing

123
00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:18.130
in Western culture. No question.
Yeah. And I was like,

124
00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:20.110
I can't do this. I
don't want to be in

125
00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:22.150
charge of all the things.
I don't want my kids

126
00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:24.670
to be raising me in
charge of all the things.

127
00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:29.650
So therefore I have to
start some sort of revolution,

128
00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.280
even if it's just in
my house. But then it

129
00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:37.720
led to me creating this
business in order to help

130
00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:41.290
it sort of move along
to give people some instruction

131
00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:43.900
on how to get from
point a to point B

132
00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:48.190
of just being harried and
chaotic all the way to

133
00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:51.400
being like, Oh, I've got
this down because we're having

134
00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:53.740
a daily standup where we
all go over our schedule.

135
00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.250
So you call this agile
home management or the, you

136
00:07:57.250 --> 00:07:59.620
know, the agile home, your
agile home is the name

137
00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:03.160
of the podcast. Are we
talking about like a morning,

138
00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.350
scrum? Like, you know, at
work, we get up at

139
00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:07.180
9:00 AM. We have our scrum
meeting, are you doing that?

140
00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:11.200
It's a little bit different.
Every morning. We basically stand

141
00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.660
across the counter from each
other and we do stand

142
00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:16.930
up and we talk about
just what's on the schedule

143
00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:19.120
for the day. We don't
really kind of go over

144
00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:25.000
what didn't get completed yesterday
because you know, there's always

145
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.910
going to be something, but
if it's not on our

146
00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:31.090
sprint, then we just kind
of, don't worry about it.

147
00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:34.810
It kind of gets pushed
back onto the backlog. But

148
00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:37.600
we do get together every
morning and sort of look

149
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.750
at what time we have
meetings so that we know

150
00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:42.760
one, whether or not we
can be in the same

151
00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:46.240
room at the time of
the meeting, or if I

152
00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.100
need to go pick up
the kids from school or

153
00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:49.750
my husband needs to go
pick up the kids from

154
00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:52.420
school and who's doing drop
off. And those sorts of

155
00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:56.130
things so that we just
know who can be where

156
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:58.860
at what time, and if
somebody has more on their

157
00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:01.470
plate that day, then maybe
somebody else has to pick

158
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:03.450
up more of the Slack
or that's a night that

159
00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:06.140
we decide to go out
to dinner. That is a

160
00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:10.220
really good point. The idea
of collective ownership is fundamental

161
00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:13.490
to agile. So in software
it's like, there's you own

162
00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:15.500
this or you own that.
But we always talk about

163
00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:18.350
the idea where we all
have collective ownership of the

164
00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:21.590
positive of the forward motion
of the project. And when

165
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:23.990
you formally decide as a
family, all right, like we're

166
00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:25.760
all in this together. Let's
just make sure that we

167
00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:28.430
say that out loud. You
just said something great where

168
00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:30.740
one person has more on
their plate than the other.

169
00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.050
And they go, Oh, I
can take that today. You

170
00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:35.480
know, you're not keeping score.
You're really trying to load

171
00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:38.570
balance the load across the
family members and build to

172
00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:42.560
their strengths. I think that's
great. Yeah. It's absolutely 100%

173
00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:45.350
about being on a team
because as a family, that's

174
00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:48.620
what you want to be.
So we got together and

175
00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:50.780
we had the kids involved
in and we set our

176
00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:54.560
family values and we set
a mission statement. I'm in,

177
00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:58.880
we live by that. So
like before something even goes

178
00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:03.140
on our schedule, it's does
this align with our values

179
00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.780
and our mission statement. And
if it doesn't, then we

180
00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:08.900
say no, and then everybody's
on the same page about

181
00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:11.810
why we say, And that's
really cool because you emailed

182
00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:15.110
me to be on the
show. After listening to my

183
00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:17.930
episode with my wife, where
we talked about mission statements.

184
00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:20.720
And you mentioned when you
emailed me that it was

185
00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.460
nice to know that you
weren't the only family that

186
00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:26.390
had a mission statement. Exactly.
Because it sounds so nerdy

187
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:29.390
when you like sit down
and you actually write it.

188
00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:31.790
But then like when you
hear other people are doing

189
00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:33.320
it, you're like, Oh, maybe
this is catching on a

190
00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:36.020
little bit. So he is,
I mean, it's super important

191
00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:40.460
because we don't want our
family to be top down

192
00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:43.250
leadership. Right? Like we did
talk about a little bit

193
00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:45.860
of the historic historical things,
run gender roles and the

194
00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:48.380
positive things and the negative
things, you know, there's both

195
00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:51.380
positive and negative, but it's
certainly not top down management.

196
00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:53.750
Right? It's not, I set
the tone or my wife

197
00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:55.970
sets the tone, right. It
is, we set the tone

198
00:10:55.970 --> 00:11:00.410
as parents and our, our,
our children, our team members,

199
00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:04.550
subordinates with team members and
also really mediocre roommates as

200
00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:14.180
well, always. But it is,
it's so good to be

201
00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:17.960
able to like, have them
be a collaborative member of

202
00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:21.140
the team. And for them
to just know, I mean,

203
00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:24.560
our family mission statement is
really, really just pop culture.

204
00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:30.080
Things that we remember. And
we say frequently versus us

205
00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:34.160
actually writing a mission statement,
but it's stuff that the

206
00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.350
kids have heard us say
over and over again. I'm

207
00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:38.300
like, I don't know if
you know the tub thumping,

208
00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:40.820
but shamba Womba, I'm afraid
I do please don't get

209
00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:45.920
as stuck in my head.
So that, that chorus is

210
00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:48.620
something that we end up,
we start it and the

211
00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:51.680
kids will finish it because
it's, you know, we, we

212
00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:54.430
know that we have to
lift each back up after

213
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:58.200
we have a fall. Okay.
Okay. So the mission statement

214
00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:01.560
sets the tone, but are
you changing your, your sprints,

215
00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:04.740
right? We usually have named
sprints or, or themes for

216
00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:06.750
each of our sprints as
we, as we move through

217
00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:11.460
time. Yes. So we, at
the, at the beginning of

218
00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:14.970
a two week period, we
sit down and we map

219
00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:18.000
out what we're going to
get done in the next

220
00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:21.810
two weeks. And for us,
it's really just kind of

221
00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:25.440
a list of either projects
that we want to get

222
00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:29.640
done or appointments that we
know that we need to

223
00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:34.590
do that are not either
set yet, or we don't

224
00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:37.500
really know where they fall
into the schedule or that

225
00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:41.790
sort of thing yet, but
we put them up. Actually

226
00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:45.480
we use deck board.com in
order to display it on

227
00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:49.320
a television screen in our
house, along with our schedule,

228
00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:52.620
I am a huge fan
of dashboard. So you gotta,

229
00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:53.700
I mean, I don't want
to be the one that

230
00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:55.710
tells people about that, but
you've got to talk about

231
00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:59.250
how deck board is a
game changer for families. Oh,

232
00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.740
deck board is phenomenal. I,
every time I get on

233
00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:05.610
a client call, I recommend
deck board because it's just

234
00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:09.030
so easy to put together
because of the drop in

235
00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:14.460
drag features. And also it's
just easy to reset up.

236
00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:17.640
Like I don't have to
be a technology expert in

237
00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:21.030
order to go in and
figure out how to put

238
00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:23.970
a countdown or how to
put my schedule up. I

239
00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:26.880
just go and get like
the icon link for my

240
00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:31.230
calendar and zoom. There it
is. And then everybody can

241
00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:35.850
see it and making the
work visible is the biggest

242
00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:39.540
game changer in parents. That
is really significant. So for

243
00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:41.460
folks that might not understand
what we're talking about, a

244
00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:44.370
DAC board, it's da K
board, we'll put a link

245
00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:47.850
in the show notes and
I've got a detailed explanation

246
00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:49.740
on my blog about how
one can make their own

247
00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:52.830
deck board. It is literally
as easy as taking any

248
00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:55.380
random monitor or computer monitor
that you have lying around.

249
00:13:55.650 --> 00:13:58.440
I got one for 20
bucks at Goodwill. I took

250
00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.780
the, I happened to take
the base off of it.

251
00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:02.760
So it's just to kind
of a picture frame. And

252
00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:05.790
then I put a raspberry
PI tiny computer inside it,

253
00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:08.250
and I hung it on
the wall in the kitchen

254
00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:10.260
and put it on the
wifi. And that was it.

255
00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:12.540
And like you said, from
there on you do all

256
00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:15.660
the management on their web
interface, right? Yes. And we

257
00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:18.660
use a television screen that
we inherited, so it was

258
00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:22.230
free. But before we got
the television screen, we used

259
00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:24.870
an iPad. See, and these
are the things we have

260
00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:28.740
these things lying around or
we've inherited them and you

261
00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:30.540
and I have my intern
off at night. So it

262
00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:32.760
saves power and things like
that. And we've got on

263
00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:35.700
ours, we've got the weather,
we've got countdowns to major

264
00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:38.640
events and things we're excited
about. We've also recently added

265
00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:42.150
children's homework and color-coded it
in different Google calendars. Oh,

266
00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:44.610
that's super cool. I love
that. My kids don't have

267
00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:47.580
homework yet. Cause they're Preschoolers
soon. It will, it will

268
00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:51.000
sneak up on you. And
then of course, so I'm

269
00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:53.350
going to have to keep
That in mind. Absolutely. And

270
00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:55.900
then when the, when the
boys got their iPads for

271
00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:58.120
school, we put Google calendar
on it and then we

272
00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:00.850
have them enter their homework.
And then we have four

273
00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:03.520
Google calendars for me and
mom and the two kids.

274
00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:06.430
And then they, we color
coded it. They add their

275
00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:09.190
homework, drop it in and
then it automatically appears on

276
00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:11.110
the screen. And then of
course, I've mentioned this on

277
00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:13.750
the show before, I'm a
type one diabetic and I

278
00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:17.410
travel. So we actually have
my blood sugar as a,

279
00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:19.960
an item as a thing
on the dashboard board. And

280
00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:22.510
this is a, an important
metric for people to glance

281
00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:24.340
at. And the kids can
see how daddy's doing, even

282
00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:27.330
though he's not there. I
love that I have a,

283
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:31.480
also have an autoimmune disease,
but it is fibromyalgia. So

284
00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:35.620
not very visible period. And
so the kids can't have

285
00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:37.510
really a visual for that,
but it's good to know

286
00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:40.960
that there is a way
to implement a health metrics

287
00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:43.180
on the dashboard. There is.
And you could do all

288
00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:45.130
kinds of fun things like,
you know how, when you,

289
00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:48.640
like, I was at the
Chicago airport recently and you

290
00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:51.070
leave the bathroom and there's
like, how was your experience?

291
00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:53.290
And there's like three buttons,
smiley face kind of medium

292
00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:55.810
face or sad face, or
you leave target. And there's

293
00:15:55.810 --> 00:15:57.490
like, did you have a
good experience? Thumbs up, thumbs

294
00:15:57.490 --> 00:16:00.340
down. You could build something
like that and have the

295
00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:01.810
kids like how was your
day? And the kid could

296
00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:03.970
like push a button and
then it could have, you

297
00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:06.160
could have the pictures of
the kids on the deck

298
00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.530
board with a happy kid
and a sad kid. And

299
00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:10.570
then you can glance at
the screen and tell whether

300
00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:11.920
or not the kid was
happy or not. That'd be

301
00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:14.530
a fun project to make
over a weekend. You can

302
00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:16.720
do anything, any status, right?
That is important to your

303
00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:20.290
project, to your original point
around being agile. What are

304
00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:23.290
our metrics of success for
our scrum? I love that.

305
00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:25.600
I'm one of the things
that that reminded me of

306
00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:28.630
is what we do for
the kids. Daily, standup is

307
00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:33.550
a visual schedule, which just
tells them everything that they

308
00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:35.890
need to do in order
to like, get ready to

309
00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:37.930
go to school in the
morning, or to get ready

310
00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:42.040
for bed at night. This
cut down on probably 90%

311
00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:46.120
of nagging and arguments, because
now it's just go look

312
00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:49.000
at your board and because
the board is in charge,

313
00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:52.300
they don't get mad at
me. So this is really

314
00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:55.950
about redirecting their anger towards
the boss, to the, to

315
00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:58.660
the man, the larger system,
right. You know, sticking it

316
00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:01.150
to the man. Exactly. And
this works for older kids

317
00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:02.650
as well. Cause a lot
of times you can just

318
00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:05.980
do like a check board
done or needs to be

319
00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:08.620
done. You know, if it's
a larger thing that they

320
00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:10.750
might have to do several
steps, you could bake an

321
00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:14.050
in progress portion. Sounds like
a more sophisticated kind of

322
00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:17.470
software engineering perspective on, you
know, the gold star system,

323
00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:19.090
right? Where you get a
white board or you get

324
00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:21.910
a dry erase marker and
you get some stickers and

325
00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:24.700
it's a big old checklist,
but it's all about visible

326
00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:28.630
work. Exactly. And making the
work visible is, I mean,

327
00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:32.650
I can't even say often
enough how important that is

328
00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:36.880
because when the work is
visible, everybody in your family

329
00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:42.550
understands how much your doing
any member. And it does

330
00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:45.610
help with just like picking
up the Slack or even

331
00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:48.940
just being understanding if somebody
is having sort of a

332
00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:52.230
day or they're in a
bad mood, you can kind

333
00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:54.480
of look at their day
and be like, Oh, I

334
00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:57.600
can see that. Maybe they
were a little spint. And

335
00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:01.670
so they were kind of
cranky. Hi friends as a

336
00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:05.780
programmer, you think an object's
with Mongo DB sodas, your

337
00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:10.160
database, Mongo DB is the
most popular document based database

338
00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:14.180
built for modern application developers
on the cloud era, millions

339
00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:17.600
of developers use Mongo DB
to power. The world's most

340
00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:22.730
innovative products and services from
cryptocurrency to online gaming IOT

341
00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:27.080
and more, you can try
Mongo DB today with Atlas,

342
00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:31.430
the global cloud database service
that runs on AWS Azure

343
00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:35.570
and Google cloud configure, deploy
and connect to your database

344
00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:38.600
in just a few minutes,
check it out at Mongo

345
00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:47.060
db.com/atlas that's M O N
G O D b.com/atlas. The,

346
00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:49.070
the thing that we've been
doing at work recently is

347
00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:53.120
this thing called objective key
results. Okay. Ours is kind

348
00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:55.700
of another way of thinking
about what our tasks are

349
00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:58.460
and whether or not they're
successful. So it's one thing

350
00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:00.290
to check a box, but
another thing to do a

351
00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:02.930
task and then measure it.
Is there any kind of

352
00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:05.660
success metrics as a family?
Like, you know, it's one

353
00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:08.240
thing to say, I got
the groceries, but you know,

354
00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:10.850
did it go well, or
am I measuring how things

355
00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:12.560
went, maybe groceries. Aren't a
good example, but I think

356
00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:16.670
you get where I'm right.
Yeah. So we do at

357
00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:19.880
the end of our sprint,
have a retro where we

358
00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:22.400
kind of ask, like what
worked for our family, the

359
00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.980
sprint and what didn't work
for our family, this sprint,

360
00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:29.030
but we don't kind of
do a daily, like this

361
00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:31.100
is kind of what went
well or didn't go well.

362
00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:34.250
But at the end of
a sprint, we do evaluate

363
00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:37.250
what worked for us as
a whole family. Cause maybe

364
00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:40.010
something worked for one person,
but it didn't work for

365
00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:44.630
somebody else. I find that
this becomes a bigger deal

366
00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:49.010
when you're talking about self
care, because when you're trying

367
00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:52.640
to find time to go
and spend by yourself, sometimes

368
00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:55.040
the time that you choose
doesn't work for the rest

369
00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:57.440
of your family and you
kind of have to tweak

370
00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:01.490
when that happens, but everyone
should be doing self care.

371
00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:03.350
But the thing that I
always like to say is

372
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:06.110
it is not the answer.
It will not solve your

373
00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:08.540
problem because I don't know
how many times I've gone

374
00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:11.720
off to like have a
bath or read a book

375
00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:15.710
and the problems that were
already facing me. Just feel

376
00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:19.490
either monumental when I get
done with my self care

377
00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:22.010
time or it's all I
can think about while I'm

378
00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:25.010
doing it. Yeah. That is
true. I mean, self care

379
00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:26.960
is important just for our
sanity, but it does certainly

380
00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:29.450
it was not gonna make
any problems go away. You

381
00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:32.570
just ignore him for a
few minutes. Absolutely. Now there

382
00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:34.460
was a, I think the
Ted talk that you probably

383
00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:37.400
saw of the people have
seen before Bruce Feiler has

384
00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:39.230
a book called the secrets
of happy families and he

385
00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:43.310
talks about scrum being potentially
the savior of the modern

386
00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:45.680
American family. Do we think
that this little bit of

387
00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:48.610
structure that we're talking about
is the thing that is

388
00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:51.970
the missing piece for our
busy lives and our connected

389
00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:55.980
lives? I certainly think so.
I mean the amount of

390
00:20:55.980 --> 00:21:01.380
significant increase on happiness and
increase in efficiency, decrease in

391
00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:04.770
budget that I have seen
since we started using agile

392
00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:08.790
is, is huge. My toddlers
are certainly more excited that

393
00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:12.840
we're asking them for their
input because often four and

394
00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:16.650
five year olds aren't asked
and they love to give

395
00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:19.050
you their opinion. You know?
And that's an interesting one

396
00:21:19.050 --> 00:21:22.710
because as with all we
won't call them junior engineers,

397
00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:24.840
your four and five year
olds, we'll call them early

398
00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:29.790
career engineers as early career
young people, right. They, their

399
00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:32.040
opinion matters, but there still
is a business problem that

400
00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:34.110
needs to be solved here.
So for example, my, my

401
00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:36.540
12 year old hates going
shopping, but the option is

402
00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:39.030
don't eat. So we try
to explain it to them

403
00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:41.490
like, okay, this is some,
you know, some distasteful work

404
00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:43.140
that needs to be done.
This is a piece of,

405
00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:45.930
of work. That's no fun,
but the, the goal is,

406
00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:49.020
you know, eat. So, you
know, how do you want

407
00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:51.510
to solve that? A lot
of times how I solved

408
00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:54.150
that is one asking a
way that we can make

409
00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:58.050
going to the grocery store,
more fun or asking if

410
00:21:58.050 --> 00:22:01.710
there is an alternative solution.
So like my five-year-old can't

411
00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:04.080
go to the grocery store.
It's too overwhelming for him.

412
00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:08.430
So usually one parent stays
home and the other parent

413
00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:11.010
goes to the store and
that may change as he

414
00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:13.470
gets older because he may
not be as overwhelmed by

415
00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:16.170
the store. But sure. That
gets to your point about

416
00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:18.510
building to your strengths, right?
Maybe they could prep the

417
00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:20.970
kitchen to receive the food
as it comes home soon.

418
00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:24.690
Yes, Exactly. And there's always
something that they can do

419
00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:28.680
to feel like they are
participating in the family, whether

420
00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:31.260
or not it be the
main task that you would

421
00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:35.310
really like for them to
do. And obviously sometimes my

422
00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:39.540
five-year-old has to go to
the grocery store and when

423
00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:42.540
he does, we just try
and like sing songs and

424
00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:45.570
dance and just make it
fun even while we're in

425
00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:47.580
the store, even if everybody's
kind of looking at us

426
00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:51.690
like we're crazy. Well, and
the thing to remember is

427
00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:54.360
that if we, if we
take this agile system or

428
00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:58.560
analogy to the, to the,
the, the, the fullest extent,

429
00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:01.500
right, at its core, it
is about each team member

430
00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:04.860
having an equal contribution to
the project, right. Everyone has

431
00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:07.920
a piece of this project
in this case, the family.

432
00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:11.970
So everyone's contribution is valued.
And, you know, even hanging

433
00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:15.510
out with the family and
being chill at the, at

434
00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:18.720
the grocery store is a
valuable thing because it made

435
00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:21.450
your job easier. You know,
getting groceries, if they're freaking

436
00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:24.930
out, that's not helpful. And
I think it's also just

437
00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:28.140
important for them to see.
So like at the meeting,

438
00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:30.420
when we talked about the
grocery store and trying to

439
00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:34.170
go there, we literally wrote
down every idea that they

440
00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:37.680
came up with. So it
might have been like the

441
00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:40.710
silliest idea and it might
have seemed to crazy to

442
00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:44.130
us, but you just write
it down anyway. And then

443
00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:46.580
at the end of the
meeting, kind of go through

444
00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:48.800
all of the options and
you come up with the

445
00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:56.050
one that is mutually desirable
and physically feasible. Interesting. Okay.

446
00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:59.740
And what do we have
kids of different ages? Sometimes

447
00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:02.110
I'll mention to my wife
that we should ask the

448
00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:05.200
12 year old something, a
formerly 11 year old, and

449
00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:06.610
she'll say, well, you know,
he doesn't know he's 12

450
00:24:06.610 --> 00:24:08.380
and what can we, you
know, what, what's his contribution

451
00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:11.380
going to be? How do
you know whether to really

452
00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:14.620
value their opinion or to
just dismiss it? Sometimes I

453
00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:17.770
just, I just write it
down anyway. And then when

454
00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:19.990
we come to the end,
when we're having the discussion,

455
00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:24.370
we'll say this doesn't work
for me because, and then

456
00:24:24.370 --> 00:24:27.220
we give sort of a
brief explanation as to why

457
00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:30.340
that doesn't work for us.
For us. It's super brief

458
00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:32.860
because I have a two
year old and a four

459
00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:37.300
year old and there'll be
three and five next month.

460
00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:41.770
Crazy. Cause it just seems,
yeah, It only, it only

461
00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:46.150
accelerates, I tell you that,
but there are people who

462
00:24:46.150 --> 00:24:49.270
say that and perhaps rightfully
so that children are not

463
00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:52.810
tiny humans. They're not tiny
adults, they are children. And

464
00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:56.410
they could argue that they
don't have logic. You know,

465
00:24:56.410 --> 00:24:59.440
I wonder what, what's a
good amount of structure. What's

466
00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:01.210
a good amount of logic.
And what's a, what's just

467
00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:03.790
good old fashioned parenting. Like,
Oh, tell him, just tell

468
00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:05.380
the kid what to do.
How do you balance that?

469
00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:09.790
So I am mostly, we
just are super collaborative here.

470
00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:12.610
And the reason being is
because I'm trying to teach

471
00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:16.720
them how to deal with
being collaborative in the future.

472
00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:20.080
But also like there are
just somethings that you just

473
00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:23.140
have to do. So then
we just sort of explain

474
00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:26.380
why we have to do
it. And then we sort

475
00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:29.560
of tell them, you know,
afterwards, we might be able

476
00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:31.270
to do this fun thing,
but we have to do

477
00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:36.130
this thing first. And you
know, that's just how life's

478
00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:38.230
going to be. Sometimes like
sometimes you're not going to

479
00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:40.780
like hanging out with a
certain person or you're going

480
00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:42.700
to have a hard boss,
or you're not going to

481
00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:47.050
want to go to the
grocery store or you're going

482
00:25:47.050 --> 00:25:49.510
to want to do something
fun versus something that you

483
00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:52.870
have to do, like study
in college. But sometimes you

484
00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:55.150
just have to make these
hard choices or you have

485
00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:57.940
to do these things that
are not your favorite in

486
00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:00.130
order to be able to
do something. That's your favorite

487
00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:02.980
later, Right? You talked about
a little bit about this

488
00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:06.280
in episode 41 of your
podcast in December last year,

489
00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:09.280
the idea of holding firm
on boundaries. So someone might

490
00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:11.380
be listening to this podcast
and thinking that this is

491
00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:14.680
some weird squishy stuff that,
you know, Yvonne and Scott

492
00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:16.720
are talking about learning to
do agile and the kids

493
00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:19.870
are going to collaborate two
year old doc, but we're

494
00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:23.470
not saying no boundaries. We're
not saying that the kids

495
00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:25.660
do anything that they want
to wish. There's still a

496
00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:28.840
leadership structure here, but it
is a very collaborative and

497
00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:31.990
positive way. And I find
the ed actually leaves me

498
00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:35.470
more in charge because I've
asked the kids for their

499
00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:39.760
opinion. They're much more likely
to do things. When I

500
00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:42.220
say, well, we just have
to do this right now.

501
00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:45.030
We to go the grocery
store because it's something that

502
00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:47.250
we have to do in
order to stock the pantry.

503
00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:50.940
And I can't take you
home or, you know, daddy's

504
00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:53.490
out of town. So it's
just being you and we

505
00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:58.020
all have to go, right.
They're just much more amicable

506
00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:01.410
to going because they don't
have to feel like they're

507
00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:03.950
never heard. Right. That's a
good point if you are

508
00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:06.740
spending every single day saying,
because I said so, which

509
00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:09.560
we all agreed as when,
when we were kids was

510
00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:12.740
a really lousy answer because
I said, so is an

511
00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:15.800
answer. It's just not the
awesome one. But if you

512
00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:18.650
get a voice more often
than not than when you,

513
00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:20.620
when the time comes along
and it's like, well, we

514
00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:22.880
just need to get the
groceries. They'll okay. All right.

515
00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:25.160
Well, they hear me on
most things, but I recognize

516
00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:27.110
I'm starting to recognize that
this grocery thing we do

517
00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:29.300
every week is pretty important
and they take your word

518
00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:33.350
for it. Yeah, exactly. And
also just, even on things

519
00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:36.410
that are like discipline, you
know, we actually had a

520
00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:39.020
problem with the bathroom and
like going to the bathroom

521
00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:41.510
and not like sitting under
the table and pretending like

522
00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:45.380
you don't have to go.
So we had a conversation

523
00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:47.900
about like, what would you,
Plastic project management issue. I

524
00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:50.540
tell ya. Yeah. So it's
like, what would make this

525
00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:53.690
easier? And then we had
a discussion where we asked

526
00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:56.060
him what would make it
easier for him to just

527
00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:59.270
not want to hide or
just get up and go.

528
00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:02.180
And you know, the solution
was that maybe he could

529
00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:04.670
have his tablet while he
went to the bathroom for

530
00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:07.820
a few minutes in order
to focus on something else,

531
00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:10.550
rather than the fact that
he's sitting there with nothing

532
00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:14.120
to do. And that's worked
like we have, we're not

533
00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:17.660
having this fight anymore. I
mean, it's a weird fight

534
00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:20.660
to feel like you're having,
but I know so many

535
00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:24.560
parents, especially of toddlers and
early elementary school kids who

536
00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:27.110
are there, Let me tell
you with a 12 year

537
00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:29.210
old and a 14 year
old, you would be surprised

538
00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:32.960
how many scrums, we'll say,
how many sprints are bathroom

539
00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:35.870
related sprints. It does not
get any better. There may

540
00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:38.150
be less cleanup, but it's
a different kind of cleanup.

541
00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:41.480
And there's socks on the
ground, in the bathroom right

542
00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:43.010
now. And you know, I'm
not going to pick them

543
00:28:43.010 --> 00:28:45.860
up. So I'm afraid that
they are lousy roommates, their

544
00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:48.530
entire lives. So you're going
to expect another 16 to

545
00:28:48.530 --> 00:28:52.850
18 years of bathroom related
scrums. That's good to know.

546
00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:56.480
So we're not alone. Anybody
out there listening, you are

547
00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:59.750
definitely not alone. So you've
been on a, you have

548
00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:02.120
your own podcast and you've
been on a couple of

549
00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:06.020
other podcasts, like the nurturing
habitat and Bosch mom talking

550
00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:08.870
about agile home management. And
you're turning this into a

551
00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:13.400
business as well. Yes, because
I found that even people

552
00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:17.120
who use agile every single
day, it didn't really know

553
00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:19.730
how to bring it up.
It's not an obvious thing

554
00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:22.720
until you kind of start
exploring and going, Oh, I

555
00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:25.460
could see how I could
run my house. Like a

556
00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:28.640
project. It wasn't immediately intuitive
to me that we had

557
00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:31.400
been doing this. Maybe not
as effectively as you had,

558
00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:34.220
but until I started really
thinking about it, it didn't

559
00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:38.300
seem intuitive. Yeah. I mean,
and it seems hard because

560
00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:42.190
you're used to doing it
one way. And then when

561
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:44.020
you try and think of
how you would do it

562
00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:46.570
at home or how you
would shift it a little

563
00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:51.820
bit, it's not automatically obvious
what that shift would be.

564
00:29:52.270 --> 00:29:56.500
For instance, our daily stand
ups are essentially just like

565
00:29:56.830 --> 00:30:00.400
going over the schedule. Whereas
like, you know, your daily,

566
00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:02.770
standup at work would be
a little bit more involved

567
00:30:02.770 --> 00:30:05.710
than that because you're working
in an environment where other

568
00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:08.770
people are dependent on the
stuff that you didn't finish

569
00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:11.860
the day before in order
to move forward onto something

570
00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:14.410
they need to do. Whereas
that maybe isn't the case

571
00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:17.190
at home. Right. And at
home it'll be very age

572
00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:20.670
dependent. My son's working on
a report right now that

573
00:30:20.670 --> 00:30:23.100
might be our scrum and
it might have some, you're

574
00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:25.860
not doing something one day
might have some future ramifications,

575
00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:28.920
but you know, five-year-olds might
not have that much persistence

576
00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:32.100
of, of objects that a,
that a 14 year old

577
00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:35.880
would. Yeah, exactly. Alright. Well,
folks can check you out

578
00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:39.030
at Yvonne Marcus. That's why
V O N N E

579
00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:40.890
Marcus, M a R C
U S. We'll make sure

580
00:30:40.890 --> 00:30:44.100

show notes to your website

581
00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:47.220
and to your Facebook community
and your podcast. Thank you

582
00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:49.950
so much for chatting with
me today about being agile

583
00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:52.710
at home. Thank you for
having me. This has been

584
00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:55.440
another episode of Hanselminutes and
we'll see you again next

585
00:30:55.440 --> 00:31:07.500
week. <inaudible>.
