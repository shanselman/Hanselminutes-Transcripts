Hey friends. I want to
introduce a new sponsor to

2
00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.520
you. H M a VPN.
It's a VPN you can

3
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.990
count on. As you know,
I do a lot of

4
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.330
travel and I tend to
connect to a lot of

5
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.600
untrusted wireless networks. And I
probably shouldn't, but I can

6
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.800
use HMA as the world's
largest VPN service offers. The

7
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.960
most server locations worldwide covers
190 countries. There's always a

8
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.290
server nearby it. Doesn't log
your IP address and allows

9
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.340
me to connect five devices
simultaneously works on basically all

10
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.350
platforms, Android, iOS, Mac, Linux,
windows routers, wherever it's actually

11
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.770
been completely redesigned recently to
make it even simpler and

12
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.440
more fun to use. And
there's even a smart kill

13
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.770
switch. That'll turn the VPN
automatically on when you launch

14
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.130
sensitive apps, here's your call
to action. My friends try

15
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:52.170
HMA VPN risk-free with a
30 day money back guarantee.

16
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:59.010
This deal is for Hanselman
its listeners. That's HMA, vpn.com/offer

17
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:20.480
hyphen Hansel minutes. That's HMA
vpn.com/offer-hansel minutes. Scott Hanselman. This

18
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.730
is That's minutes today. I'm
talking with Ben eater, eater.net.

19
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.580
That's a T E r.net.
You can see all of

20
00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.250
the great content and projects
that he's working on. The

21
00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.560
one that he is known
for and his people are

22
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.770
excited about this year is
building a 65 Oh two

23
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.110
computer building on some of
the work that he had

24
00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.620
done. Building a computer from
basic basic parts. How are

25
00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.970
you, sir? Good. How are
you, Scott? I am a

26
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.970
little bit overwhelmed. I've got
the psychic weight of this

27
00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.900
computer. That's half built on
my kitchen counter. I've been

28
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.480
told by my spouse to
move it into the dining

29
00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.120
room. Yes, you've gone fully
down the rabbit hole. I

30
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.170
surely have. I almost think,
I feel like I need

31
00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.360
a room to build this
in because at first I

32
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.160
over, I was a desk
and then a counter. And

33
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.520
now it's the entire dining
room table. Yeah. Sorry to

34
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.960
have taken over your life
there. How did you decide

35
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.460
that this was a thing
you wanted to do? And

36
00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.860
like, I'm trying to understand
your, I would like to

37
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.170
actually hear back up a
little bit. Your background. Are

38
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.630
you an electrical engineer? Is
that what you took in

39
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:29.090
college? No. So I guess
I started in college studying

40
00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.960
computer science and never ended
up finishing that degree. This

41
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.840
was sort of the mid
nineties and it turned out

42
00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.120
to, for a variety of
reasons to make more sense,

43
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.980
to just dive into industry.
And from there got heavily

44
00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.040
involved in computer networking. And
so I spent maybe 15

45
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.990
years doing sort of systems
engineering with computer networks. And,

46
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.380
and then from that kind
of move back towards software

47
00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.700
engineering and spent the last
seven or eight years doing

48
00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.930
software at Khan Academy. And
so it was really a

49
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.300
Khan Academy that I got
interested in making my own

50
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.900
content and started making YouTube
videos on hardware, which had

51
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.360
always been an interest and
a passion. And, you know,

52
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.770
I've, I've always been tinkering
with various hardware projects and,

53
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.120
and computer related projects. As
I started making videos of

54
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.380
this eight bit CPU from
scratch as just kind of

55
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.250
a, you know, a thing
that I was interested in,

56
00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:32.790
in sharing. There's a lot
of diversity of, of knowledge

57
00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.370
and background in the computer
science industry. Like we all

58
00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.940
call ourselves software engineers and
there's lots of people saying,

59
00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.860
Oh, I'm a front end
engineer. And I do, I

60
00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.290
do, you know, jQuery and
I do angular and I

61
00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.800
do that, but we're also
offering engineers. But at the

62
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.580
same time though, someone may
have gone to MIT and

63
00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.640
come out of that with
a master's degree in these

64
00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.610
things and built an AP,
a CPU from scratch. Now

65
00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.050
you're telling me, and I'm
just learning this for the

66
00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.600
first time that you never
even finished your degree. And

67
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.390
you're doing this, I'm feeling
like as I'm learning and

68
00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.300
going through this process myself,
that I've clearly either missed

69
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.930
a class or forgotten to
take something. How did you

70
00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.900
pick this stuff up? Is
this just literally reading and

71
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.840
absorbing and reading and absorbing
because not every front end

72
00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.980
JavaScript engineer knows what an
end gate is. Sure. Yeah.

73
00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.520
I think it's just been
something I've always been around

74
00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.590
to some degree. So, you
know, as far back as,

75
00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.070
as high school and even
middle school, I was interested

76
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.860
in programming and interested in,
in, in computer hardware and

77
00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.590
that sort of thing. And,
you know, back then, you

78
00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.780
know, we didn't have Arduinos,
but you could plug things

79
00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.150
into like the printer port
on your computer. And that

80
00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.400
gave you eight bits of
digital IO that you could

81
00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.500
do things with kind of
like what people do with

82
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.410
Arduinos today. And so, you
know, I would do that.

83
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.140
And then the next level
beyond that is, you know,

84
00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.180
you could, you can build
a card that plugs into

85
00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.220
the bus and your computer
and the old ISA bus,

86
00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:57.230
and that gives you more
IO possibilities. And so I

87
00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:01.050
I'd done things like that,
you know, just tinkering around

88
00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.800
in high school and then
know, like I said, a

89
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.060
lot of that kind of
went on the shelf for

90
00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.210
awhile. As I got into
my career, focused more on

91
00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:13.080
higher level of networking stuff
and then software, you know,

92
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.950
front end software engineering. And,
and then that was something

93
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:18.360
I just wanted to kind
of get back into as

94
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.600
a hobby. When you put
something like this together, though,

95
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:27.780
you speak with a patient
and a quiet authority where

96
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.240
I, as the viewer am
going well, Ben really knows

97
00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.310
what he's talking about, you
know? And certainly there's always

98
00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:33.900
people on the internet saying,
Oh, well you did that

99
00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.790
wrong. Or we are wired
the circuit that way or

100
00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:39.870
whatever, but how do you
feel qualified to build something

101
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.120
like this? And did it
take any amount of like,

102
00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.010
okay, I can do this.
Like I could build an

103
00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.100
eight bit CPU from scratch
and I, and I can

104
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.720
say this and put it
down on the internet and

105
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.520
people will enjoy it. Yeah.
That's a good question. I

106
00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.160
mean, that's a, I think
a good question for anyone.

107
00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.230
Like when, when are you
an authority? It's like, are

108
00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:00.730
you learning or are you
like the teacher that we've

109
00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:05.290
all had? Who's just one
chapter ahead. I hope I'm

110
00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:08.200
more than one chapter ahead.
I know that I'm several

111
00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.880
chapters behind I'm enjoying I'm
enjoying that very much. Yeah.

112
00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:15.670
Yeah, no, I mean, these
are, like I said, these

113
00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:17.530
are, these are projects and
things that I've, I've always

114
00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:20.950
had an interest in. And
so it's been something that

115
00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:23.620
I've been absorbing over, you
know, I think a long

116
00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.050
period of time. And so
I've had a lot of

117
00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:28.000
time to sort of think
about it and think about,

118
00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.620
you know, how do I
make sense of this? And

119
00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:35.590
I think to some degree,
that is what people find

120
00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.910
interesting or fresh about, about
the content I'm making is

121
00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:41.830
I'm coming at it from,
you know, this is how

122
00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:44.650
my brain has processed this
stuff over a number of

123
00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:49.090
years. This isn't, this isn't
a regurgitation of how it

124
00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:51.880
was structured in a textbook.
When I first learned It

125
00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:55.720
is a combination informally Experience.
Yeah. Yeah. And I think,

126
00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:57.550
I mean, I think the
traditional way that you, you

127
00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:00.310
might, a professor might teach
a class along these lines

128
00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:03.070
would be, you know, there
was some curriculum that was

129
00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:05.470
set out and then that
professor, you know, learn that

130
00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:08.230
curriculum and has always had
that framework for understanding it.

131
00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:11.260
And then that the gaps
have been filled in over

132
00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.410
many years of experience of
course. But I think there's

133
00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:17.980
still that same fundamental framework
underneath that. Whereas I think

134
00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:20.680
to the extent that I'm
doing something new here, it's,

135
00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:23.200
you know, because I didn't
start with a framework and

136
00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.690
I just kind of piece
this stuff together on my

137
00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:28.330
own, over a period of,
you know, at this point

138
00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:32.530
a couple of decades. Yeah.
I, I maybe have just

139
00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:34.630
a little bit different perspective
on it, which is, which

140
00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:36.700
is what I think people
think, Right. And that perspective

141
00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:39.220
offers that, that freshness. And
it's had a number of

142
00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:41.110
times where I've been doing
stuff. Of course, I'm not

143
00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:42.790
doing the AP at CPU
from scratch. I'm doing the

144
00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:46.570
65 Oh two, which still
feels pretty low level to

145
00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:49.600
me. And I've been doing
this for almost 30 years

146
00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:51.640
and I have had at
least a half dozen times,

147
00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:55.210
including once were literal jaw
drop. And I, and I

148
00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:57.220
was like, you know, I
don't talk to myself. Some

149
00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:59.710
people sit quietly in their
room and they have full

150
00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:03.070
on conversations with themselves, but
I literally was doing this.

151
00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:05.560
I think I was somewhere
in like hour 11 or

152
00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.150
12. And I was just,
and I literally was like,

153
00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.170
Oh, and like, you know,
30 years of like, I

154
00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:13.180
thought it worked this way
and it worked that way

155
00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:16.440
kind of happened. I'm really
curious what that moment was

156
00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:18.760
When I actually wrote a
little bit about it. But

157
00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.370
it was one of those
things where it was a

158
00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:25.100
combination of understanding the rising
edge versus the, the, the,

159
00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:28.660
the trailing as like when
things occur, the, you know,

160
00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:31.630
polling versus interrupts and how
data was flowing from the

161
00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:35.820
prom into the computer. And
then out into the, the,

162
00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:41.680
the latched chip. And I
had swapped two wires. So

163
00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:45.310
I had eight, I had
my eight bits wires of

164
00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:49.690
four and five were swapped.
And I was frustrated because

165
00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:52.780
this thing would keep, keep
getting like, you know what,

166
00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.430
let me look at, I
actually, I wrote this up,

167
00:08:54.790 --> 00:09:00.690
I getting a, B two
and I wanted AA and

168
00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:03.270
I was just getting angry.
And I wasn't thinking I

169
00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:06.990
was just getting angry and
I kept thinking, I know

170
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:08.040
what I want to come
getting. And I was like,

171
00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:10.260
you know, I've done something
wrong. And I took the

172
00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:11.520
whole thing apart and rewired
took the whole thing and

173
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:14.910
rewired it. And I was
thinking about things in terms

174
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:17.370
of hex. And I, I
think about hex in terms

175
00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:19.590
of colors, because I've been
spending as much time on

176
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:22.260
the web. So, so AA,
I can tell you what

177
00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.890
color it is, but I
can't see the binary. So

178
00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:28.560
I stopped and thought, and
I said, hang on. What

179
00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:31.050
the heck am I actually
doing here? And that moment

180
00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:35.430
took me from simply following
your videos and moving my

181
00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:37.680
hands the way you were
moving your hands so that

182
00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:41.100
I might copy you to
a moment where I went,

183
00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:45.450
Oh, B two is one
zero, one, one zero. Like

184
00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:46.890
it's like, I was trying
to go at one zero

185
00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:49.530
one zero one zero one.
And I said, Oh, and

186
00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:53.070
I just, my brain drew
a direct line between, there's

187
00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:56.460
a, there's five volts on
that. I have literally flipped

188
00:09:56.580 --> 00:10:00.120
these two wires and I
just flipped them. And then

189
00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:01.800
the thing worked and it
was like, it went, it

190
00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:07.050
went from totally completely, utterly
useless does not work to

191
00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:09.870
work exactly. As Ben said,
it would because of these

192
00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:13.590
two wires. And it was
just a moment where software

193
00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:18.420
and hardware and electrons came
together into this Venn diagram.

194
00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:20.880
And I just went, Oh,
and then I, of course,

195
00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:25.140
I'm finding myself on my,
you know, quad processor, Intel,

196
00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:27.060
whatever going, how does this
thing even working at all?

197
00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:29.610
Like, it's a miracle that
the house of cards that

198
00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:33.590
has me building here is
a thing. It is. I

199
00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:37.340
mean, yeah, it is amazing.
But, but no. Yeah, I

200
00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:39.830
think, I think that is
an interesting insight. You know,

201
00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:43.010
that as, as a software
engineer, as you, just the

202
00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:45.080
way you think about problems,
you don't generally have to

203
00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:47.780
think about, you know, maybe
two bits on my bus

204
00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:51.050
or swapped And maybe the
operating center, maybe they are

205
00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:53.030
swapped. And the operating system
is cleaning up for me

206
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:55.910
when I was starting out.
I think we're probably somewhat

207
00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:59.000
contemporaries in age, we were
thinking about big Indian and

208
00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.120
little Indian on the network
and who, who was doing

209
00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:05.570
that and who was paying
the computational price for the

210
00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:08.840
Indian swap as you move
off the network and under

211
00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:13.280
the process. And now that's
just long forgotten. Yeah. But

212
00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:14.240
they're still hard to know
What are you going to

213
00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.880
do it, which actually lets
me one thing I wanted

214
00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:18.260
to ask you. And I've
mentioned this before in other

215
00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.080
shows, is that, what do
you think the value is

216
00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:24.560
about learning about the metal?
Because a young person on

217
00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:28.220
my team said that they
don't learn from the metal

218
00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:31.100
up as I did. And
it's, it sounds like you

219
00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:34.550
did. They learned from the
screen back. So for them,

220
00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:36.980
the metal is F 12
tools and then they tunnel

221
00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:39.650
into the computer from there
until they decide that they've

222
00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:42.920
reached a layer of obstruction
that they're comfortable with. I'm

223
00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:46.850
enjoying learning from lower down
than I've ever been. And

224
00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:52.970
then tunneling back up. I
don't, I don't know that

225
00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:56.680
there's necessarily a, I don't
know. I go back and

226
00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:59.740
forth on whether there's some,
you know, strong pedagogical stance

227
00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:01.660
I could take about why
one is better than the

228
00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:04.300
other. And I, I just,
I don't know if I

229
00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:07.090
can, but, but the one
thing I can say is

230
00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:09.670
that there is always a
sense of mystery that you

231
00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:12.700
have when you look at
a computer, unless you start

232
00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:16.900
from those first principles. Although
I guess you still have

233
00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:18.280
to, you still have to
draw a line of like,

234
00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:20.350
where are those first principles?
Because even if you start

235
00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:23.980
at the, at the, at
the beginning with, with electrons,

236
00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:27.220
you could still be going
and asking questions about physics.

237
00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:30.030
And we don't know the
answer to those, but I,

238
00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:31.660
but I think if you're
willing to accept some basics

239
00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:34.690
about physics and work up
from there, then I think

240
00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:37.570
you can develop the sense
that, okay, computers are not

241
00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:43.180
magical. They're just really complex.
And it's, you know, it's

242
00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:46.180
miraculous that, you know, a
modern computer does what it,

243
00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:49.000
what it does, but it's,
it's miraculous just in the

244
00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.890
sense of like, wow, it's
really amazing what humans can

245
00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:53.730
do. And the idea that
we've miniaturized it. And even

246
00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:56.970
now looking at your giant
eight bit CPU from scratch,

247
00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:59.940
I still am not a
hundred percent clear on inside

248
00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:04.020
the 7,400 series chips and,
and gate, like, how is

249
00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:08.400
it right. Doing the end?
Yeah. I do have videos

250
00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:12.360
on that. So I haven't.
Okay. Yeah. I've got, I've

251
00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:15.450
got videos where I talk
about the chemistry of semiconductors

252
00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:17.190
and how a transistor works
and then how you can

253
00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:20.700
build an Gates from transistors
and then from that kind

254
00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:23.100
of launch into, okay, let's
build a computer Gates. Okay.

255
00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:25.350
So that is my missing
piece then. Yeah. And I'm

256
00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:29.970
looking here on your YouTube
at YouTube slash eater BC,

257
00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:34.230
you've got all the way
down to the lowest, lowest

258
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:37.800
levels and you have, and
they're really Willy well paced,

259
00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:41.100
but I still find myself
pausing for a second cause

260
00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:42.840
I need to absorb, you
know what I mean? You

261
00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:47.280
don't. Yeah, Yeah. I am.
I mean, my goal is

262
00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:49.770
to not leave anything out.
So I don't, I don't

263
00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:53.100
want this sort of hand
wavy, like, okay, this is

264
00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:55.740
roughly how it works. And
then like fast forward, a

265
00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:57.750
little bit near here at
works and lead out some

266
00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:00.120
detail. You know, I always,
I always want you to

267
00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:01.680
be able to say, well,
wait a minute. Why is

268
00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:05.100
that? And have that answer
in there somewhere. But at

269
00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:07.650
the same time, I don't
want the videos to drag

270
00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:10.620
on and on and on
and on covering every little,

271
00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:14.790
you know, detailing in detail.
So it's a, it's a

272
00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:17.580
balancing act. And I think,
you know, what you're recognizing

273
00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:20.040
is, is, you know, hopefully
what I'm aiming for, which

274
00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:22.050
is that you can sit
back and watch the whole

275
00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:24.210
thing. And I think kind
of soak it in and

276
00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:27.360
get a sense of like,
okay, this all makes sense.

277
00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:29.850
But then if you really
want to understand it, you

278
00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:32.610
do need to go slower
and really process everything that's

279
00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:36.490
there because hopefully there is
some information density Back. If

280
00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:38.790
one goes to your videos
on YouTube and goes back

281
00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:41.340
to 60 years ago, there
is a, there is a,

282
00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:45.270
a Khan Academy ask style.
It appears that you're here

283
00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:48.210
using the same software and
the same kind of style.

284
00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:50.910
And then somewhere as you
get into the latches and

285
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:53.600
flops and the other stuff
you've developed your own style,

286
00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:56.210
which is, you know, a
black background and your hands

287
00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:59.690
and your peaceful voice and
a pen. And most recently

288
00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:03.530
you've even been taking pieces
of paper with cutouts of

289
00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:05.660
other pieces of paper and
doing this kind of cool

290
00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:10.400
replacement. Did you, were you
initially copying Khan because it

291
00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.140
was what you were doing
at the word at work

292
00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:16.640
and then how did you
develop your own style? Yeah,

293
00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:18.410
it just happened naturally. I
mean, I think just like

294
00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:21.050
you said, I was working
at Khan Academy and so,

295
00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:22.820
you know, I look, look
at Sal and I see

296
00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:24.110
what he's doing. And I'm
like, Oh, that's working. Let

297
00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:26.360
me get a pen tablet
and do that. And I

298
00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:30.110
started doing that. And, and
then I think as I,

299
00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:33.830
as I transitioned to the
physical world and that sort

300
00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:36.800
of forced me to change
style a little bit because

301
00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:39.890
the, with the pen tablet,
of course, you've got, you

302
00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:42.650
know, the pen tablets, all,
it's all digital, even though

303
00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:46.580
you're writing, you know, but
when I started pulling out,

304
00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:48.950
okay, here's a breadboard, here's
a transistor, you know, started

305
00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:50.780
building something. It's like, okay,
now I need a camera

306
00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:54.800
pointed at what I'm doing.
And I, there are maybe

307
00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.660
some really old videos where
I kind of toggled back

308
00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:58.850
and forth between the pen
tablet and the camera and,

309
00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:03.020
and that got a little
bit cumbersome. And so, yeah,

310
00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:05.270
I just started drawing on
paper and then just over

311
00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:09.320
time, the style developed to
what it is. So, you

312
00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:11.330
know, I very much was
like, okay, let me imitate

313
00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:13.940
this thing that I, that
I see that works. But

314
00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:18.440
then as, as time progresses,
it became my own, Hey

315
00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:20.870
friends, you know how I
love great podcasts. And I

316
00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:23.750
want you to check out
the code newbie podcasts, all

317
00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:27.830
about stories from folks on
their coding journey. They talked

318
00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:31.010
to new developers, experienced developers
and everyone in between about

319
00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:34.040
how they got started learning
to code how they navigate

320
00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:37.250
their technical careers. And they
also do deep dives into

321
00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:41.090
technical topics in a newbie
friendly way, check out their

322
00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:46.100
podcast at www dot COVID,
newbie that's any w B

323
00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:54.050
I e.org/podcast. That's code newbie.org/podcast.
I love also that a

324
00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:57.020
community has built around your
videos to augment and to

325
00:16:57.020 --> 00:17:00.410
fill in things that you
might find easier, intuitive, that

326
00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:03.590
they might find less. So,
so for example, your videos,

327
00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:05.780
the ones that I'm doing
through are the four main

328
00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:09.800
videos on the 65 Oh
two and they're are between

329
00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:12.140
a half an hour and
an hour long. And the

330
00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:14.720
last one I just did
was 15 minutes long, and

331
00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:16.340
it took me about five
to six hours to get

332
00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:17.960
through it because there's moments
where you'll say, I'm going

333
00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:20.240
to wire this, and then
you fast forward time. And

334
00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.700
I pause it. And there's
a great community on Reddit,

335
00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:27.140
under your Reddit on your
name, where people actually made

336
00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:31.010
PDFs of chip diagrams that
I can then paste to

337
00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:32.840
the top of my chips.
They have the pin outs,

338
00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:35.720
and I discovered that five
hours into it. And it

339
00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:37.640
really sped me up and
helped me out a lot.

340
00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:42.220
Yeah. The community is really
amazing. And yeah, I don't,

341
00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:45.260
didn't expect that when I
started making these videos, for

342
00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.450
sure. They're very kind and
very helpful. And they've also,

343
00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:49.710
they kind of acted as
your tech support, you know?

344
00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:55.530
Yes. Which I definitely appreciate
since I obviously don't have

345
00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:58.550
the time to answer every
possible. Have you made this,

346
00:17:58.550 --> 00:18:00.350
your full time thing? Is
this what you're doing now?

347
00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:04.600
It is. Yeah. What does
that mean? Is that, do

348
00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:06.800
you like just wake up
and wait for the spirit

349
00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:08.240
to move you? Or do
you like God to make

350
00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:13.370
the videos It's somewhere in
between, you know, some days,

351
00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:16.580
some days I feel a
little more inspired than others,

352
00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:22.100
but you know, the, the,
the downside, I guess, of

353
00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:24.500
having that community is I
do feel like I owe

354
00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:26.990
something to these people and,
you know, I've made a

355
00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:30.140
commitment to getting this series
of videos out. And at

356
00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:32.090
the same time I'm thinking
about, okay, what's the next

357
00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:36.680
project I'm going to do.
And, but yeah, it's, it's

358
00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:39.830
certainly different than previously. When
I was at Khan Academy,

359
00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:42.320
working on a software engineering
team, A lot of people

360
00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:44.540
since I've been building the
65 Oh two and I

361
00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:46.220
get to be clear to
the audience, what I did

362
00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:49.040
is I, I, I discovered
Ben site, I watched the

363
00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:50.330
videos. I was like, Oh
my goodness, I'm going to

364
00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:52.940
build that. I thought about
buying the parts. And then

365
00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:54.560
I went and saw that
you had done all that

366
00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:56.030
work for us and bag
them and put them in

367
00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:59.120
a box. So you can
buy a kit to do

368
00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:02.750
the projects that Ben does
yourself. I bought the kit

369
00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:05.690
and then I also got
the clock module and that

370
00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:08.990
included an apron programmer. And
then I bought an inexpensive,

371
00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:13.610
tiny little as telescope. Each
time I felt I was

372
00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:16.550
in over my head and
people are asking me, well,

373
00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:19.820
what, what level should I
be? How do you answer

374
00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:22.100
a question like that? How
do you say what, where

375
00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:24.560
should people be to be
able to do this project?

376
00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:28.160
I don't really know how
to answer that question. I

377
00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:30.920
mean, my, the best answer
I can give is watch

378
00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.320
all the videos, you know,
just, just sit down and

379
00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:36.350
finish the series and draw
your own conclusion. I mean,

380
00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:39.680
you know, the videos don't
hide anything. I don't think

381
00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:43.340
that's not my intent anyway.
So, you know, the question

382
00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:45.710
is, can you do what,
what you see me doing

383
00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:48.230
and do the things that
I'm saying in those videos

384
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:50.660
make sense to you? Can
you follow along? Do you

385
00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:53.300
feel like, Oh, I'm getting
left behind and I, and

386
00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:56.810
I, I'm not really sure
what's going on here, but

387
00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:58.640
I think if, yeah, if
you, if you watch through

388
00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:00.440
a series that you're there
thinking to see if you're

389
00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:02.270
interested in the 65 Oh
two series, you know, watch

390
00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:05.720
through those four videos and
just kinda judge for yourself,

391
00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:08.720
like, did that make sense?
Did the parts that were

392
00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:10.370
a little hand wavy to
me, do, what do I

393
00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:12.740
do? I think I can
dig in and really understand

394
00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:15.710
that. Or were there just
concepts that just, you know,

395
00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:17.360
I just feel like I
have no idea where to

396
00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:21.560
even get a toehold. That
that would be my advice

397
00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:24.380
is, is just, just watch
the videos they're free and

398
00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:27.260
yeah. Come, come to your
own conclusion about whether it

399
00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:28.790
makes sense to you. And
I, and I think if

400
00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:30.560
it does make sense to
you, I think you've got

401
00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:32.420
a pretty good shot at
being able to do it

402
00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:35.210
yourself. Now you will find
as you do it yourself,

403
00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:38.270
that there are lots of
things you, you probably didn't

404
00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:39.890
pick up on in the
videos when you watch them

405
00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:43.280
the first time. So it's
not necessarily gonna be an

406
00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:48.010
easy project, but that's to
some degree point, I mean,

407
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:52.360
I think it's, I think
it's a unique aspect of

408
00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:54.310
this is that is that
it's not kind of a

409
00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:57.160
paint by number kit where
you just, you know, pull

410
00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:59.310
the things out, like a,
like a Lego set and

411
00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:01.000
just snap it together. And
it works. That is a

412
00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.270
really good thing to point
out because I didn't think

413
00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:06.610
it was, but also, I
didn't know. I didn't really

414
00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:09.070
realize that. I didn't know
a bunch of things like

415
00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:11.350
you do, you do some
cool stuff to move the

416
00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:14.380
process forward. You've got pre-stripped
wires. They also have to

417
00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:17.620
be pre bent. So I'll
pause something and you'll go,

418
00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:20.890
yeah, here's, you know, 16
pins here and then you've

419
00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:22.450
gone and you've hooked up
the Arduino and you're going

420
00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:24.460
to do, you know, 32
pins. And then that's like

421
00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:27.910
a half an hour and
I had to, and then

422
00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:29.620
you also undo it and
do it again and undo

423
00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:31.060
do it and do it
again. And I was just

424
00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:34.360
like, this is take some
time. And then I go

425
00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:36.790
and I learn other techniques.
I get a wire stripper,

426
00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:38.860
or I, you know, I,
I go, well, this isn't

427
00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:40.660
the right tool for the
job. I'll use this tool.

428
00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:44.410
There is the assumption that
there's a certain amount of

429
00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:47.560
familiarity with these, these portable
breadboards, with the ability to

430
00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:50.560
use a multimedia, even where
I thought I knew how

431
00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:54.460
to use a multimeter, but
I really didn't until I

432
00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:59.020
was forced to. Yeah, it's
interesting. Cause I think I'm

433
00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:01.870
learning as well, like where
the gaps are with people.

434
00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:04.210
Cause I there's certain assumptions
I make, you know, they're

435
00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:07.030
obviously baked into the videos
because I made them and

436
00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:08.680
then I'm realizing, Oh wait
a minute. Okay. Maybe some

437
00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:10.900
of these things are, are
not obvious to people or,

438
00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:12.970
or the things that I
thought might be challenging, but

439
00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:14.950
that's where, you know, it's
really encouraging to me to

440
00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:17.110
see the community stepping up
and filling in some of

441
00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:19.300
those gaps. And I keep
asking myself though, because I

442
00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:22.960
have taken II classes, I'll
be it 30 years ago,

443
00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:26.200
you'll say something casually like,
Oh, and this is happening

444
00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:27.880
on the rising edge or,
well, this is a pull

445
00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:29.770
up resistor or pull down
resistor. And then it's like,

446
00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:32.110
Oh my goodness. And then
I'm off watching someone else's

447
00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:36.720
video. I want to pull
up resistors. And I, and

448
00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:40.360
I go to myself, like,
how far are you going

449
00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:43.210
to become the Khan Academy
for all things? A electron.

450
00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:47.920
Yeah. I don't, I don't
know. Like, yeah, it doesn't

451
00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:49.750
make sense for me to
make a video on pull

452
00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:53.260
up resistors. I don't, I
don't know. Does the question

453
00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:54.820
is though when I hear
a word I don't know,

454
00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:56.590
or a phrase and I
like, Oh, this is a

455
00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:59.860
concept that people who do
this should know, and then

456
00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:01.780
I go off and I
learn about that thing. That

457
00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:03.880
is definitely a self starter
project. I like that. You

458
00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:07.770
said it's not paint by
numbers. Yeah, yeah, no, I

459
00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:11.860
think for sure. But I
think if you are sufficiently

460
00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:14.980
motivated, it's, you know, hopefully
I've been having a blast.

461
00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:16.540
Like I said, I'm about
11, 12 hours into it.

462
00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:20.290
I've made it through two
videos taken over that one

463
00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:22.870
part of the house. One
of the things that's interesting

464
00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:24.700
also about these videos from
a very much a self

465
00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:28.180
learning perspective is do I
stop when I got it

466
00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:30.430
to work or do I
stop when I understand how

467
00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:35.590
I got it to work?
Right. I would, I would

468
00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:37.270
encourage you to stop. I
get it. Like I got

469
00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:40.090
the clock to work and
I moved on to a

470
00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:42.280
hello world. And then I
said, I got to back

471
00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:45.470
up and remind myself how
the clock works. Get a

472
00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:48.680
few sleeps in to put
that memory into the medium

473
00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:51.710
storage. So I don't lose
that short term memory. Right.

474
00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:55.850
And then right now I'm
on part two moving into

475
00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:59.390
part three and I've got
it working, but I'm having

476
00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:02.390
some, I don't know, I'll
just call them quantum effects

477
00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:04.550
or, you know, some Heisenberg
uncertainty principle where if I

478
00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:08.390
look at it, it changes
it. And I don't know

479
00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:09.890
well, but there's a reason
though, and this is the

480
00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:13.220
part because you've, you've baked
me in with multiple hours

481
00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:16.250
of like, well, this is
deterministic. If something's not working,

482
00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:18.980
it's, there's a reason it's
kind of cool. There's no

483
00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:22.310
one to blame, but, but
God himself and your, and

484
00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:26.120
yourself, I can't blame you.
It works in your video.

485
00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:29.900
It must be me or
the corks that are preventing

486
00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:32.000
this from happening. Right. You
know? And that's the mystery.

487
00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:39.160
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. What do
you do about that? Like,

488
00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:41.110
I've known that you follow
you. I don't see that

489
00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:43.570
you're super active on Reddit,
but people are super active

490
00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:46.300
on your Reddit having conversations
about like, I don't know

491
00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:48.520
how Ben ever got this
to work and then other

492
00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:50.640
people are like, Oh, but
this is amazing. It worked

493
00:24:50.650 --> 00:24:53.230
on the first try these
a, is it just a

494
00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:56.290
matter of wires swapping or
is it quality of components?

495
00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:59.110
Some of the things about
maybe the power supply doesn't

496
00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:02.200
have enough voltage if you've
seen some of those comments

497
00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:05.350
and I'm curious your experience
with how many people have

498
00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:08.680
had those issues when putting
the kids together. Yeah, I

499
00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:10.270
do. I do generally try
to follow the Reddit. I

500
00:25:10.270 --> 00:25:12.490
know I'm not super active.
A lot of that though

501
00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:14.170
comes down to the fact
that there are other people

502
00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:17.260
that jump in with the
right answer sooner than I

503
00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:20.560
get around to it. But
no, I am generally aware

504
00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:22.480
of some of those. I
think one of the biggest

505
00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:25.390
things, as far as I
can tell is quality of

506
00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:28.990
breadboards. Really? This is something
that I, yeah, this is

507
00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:31.750
something that I learned as,
as a part of this

508
00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:35.110
project that I, that I
would not have suspected beforehand,

509
00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:37.930
which is that there is
a huge difference in the

510
00:25:37.930 --> 00:25:43.060
build quality of different breadboards.
And, and that's reflected generally

511
00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:45.280
in the price. I mean,
I guess, you know, an

512
00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:48.730
imperfect proxy, but the difference
between a $2 breadboard and

513
00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:52.090
a $10 breadboard is just
night and day. And if

514
00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:54.070
you pull them apart and
at some point I want

515
00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:56.950
to do a video or
at least a blog post

516
00:25:56.950 --> 00:25:59.710
or something, because I got
some really cool pictures under

517
00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:02.440
microscope of the parts and
stuff. When you pull apart

518
00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:06.250
a breadboard and just the,
the different, even just the

519
00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:08.650
different alloys of metal that
they use in there, some

520
00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:11.870
are more springy than others.
Wow. Yeah. Yeah. So the,

521
00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:14.110
the really good quality ones,
they use some alloy that's

522
00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:16.330
very springy. And so when
you stick a wire in

523
00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:19.330
and out, a bunch of
times, it always snapped back

524
00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:22.210
and has the same, you
know, grippiness on that wire,

525
00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:25.960
whereas the cheap ones will
deform. And once you've shoved

526
00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:28.360
a wire in and out,
you know, enough times, it

527
00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:32.320
just doesn't have the same
grip anymore. And then you

528
00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:34.900
end up with these really
sort of flaky connections And

529
00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:37.990
F and flakies are the
problem. That's the thing. And

530
00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:40.330
that's Oh yeah. Yeah. Well,
as you, as you mentioned,

531
00:26:40.330 --> 00:26:42.340
like you get two bits
swapped and you have a

532
00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:48.000
computer that is a computer.
So, so one, one wire

533
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.450
can, It's so funny though,
because it really like the

534
00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:52.730
lower level. You, it sounds,
it's so obvious, but again,

535
00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:55.670
I can't express enough what
a, an eyeopening experiences is.

536
00:26:55.670 --> 00:26:57.890
Like, these may be silly
and stupid questions that I'm

537
00:26:57.890 --> 00:27:00.050
asking, but it's like, yeah.
You know, that's the million

538
00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:03.020
dollar semi-colon or whatever. It's
like, yeah, like that one

539
00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:05.510
bit that is now a
brick. It was a computer

540
00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:07.610
a minute ago, and now
it is no longer a

541
00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:12.290
computer. Right. And there's, There's
nothing. So like another thing

542
00:27:12.290 --> 00:27:13.700
that I've had, I've now
that I've, now that I've

543
00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:16.280
gotten farther into the project,
I've got four breadboards all

544
00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:18.860
working together. I need to
make sure that voltage is

545
00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:22.220
going smoothly across all four.
Cause I've, I've lined all

546
00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:25.580
my rails up. Some people
have suggested running power down

547
00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:30.170
multiple rails from multiple locations.
Yep. Yeah. That does. Is

548
00:27:30.170 --> 00:27:31.700
that, is that, is that
a thing like, is that

549
00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:33.410
say like, I can do
that. I can get other

550
00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:39.170
throw five volts altogether and
down each. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

551
00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:42.890
In parallel. Sure. Yeah. Yeah.
There's a video as part

552
00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:46.790
of the, the eight-bit CPU,
which is 14 breadboards also

553
00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:50.090
connected together where I talk
about power distribution and that's,

554
00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:51.980
and that's one of the
things I recommended in that

555
00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:55.760
video. And that's one of
the things that is, is

556
00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:58.700
interesting about this is that
I'm doing it on breadboards,

557
00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:02.750
which I think most professional
electrical engineers would look at

558
00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:04.040
that and say, why in
the world would you do

559
00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:06.260
that? Like, just get, just
make a printed circuit board.

560
00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:09.710
They're they're cheap and easy
and you can get them

561
00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:12.140
turned around from China and
in a week, or even

562
00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:14.690
less, and get a custom
printed circuit board, solder everything

563
00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:17.960
on, you know, all the
connections are there. You, you

564
00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:20.450
know, you design the printed
circuit board in a EDA

565
00:28:20.450 --> 00:28:23.600
tool that, that does have
a linter effectively, you know,

566
00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:26.720
design rule, checking, electrical, checking,
you know, thing that checks

567
00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:30.680
that why not do that?
And I think the value

568
00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:34.730
of the breadboard is that
you, it forces you to

569
00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:39.710
think about every connection in
a way that I think

570
00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:41.330
if, if you were to
lay out the, the, the

571
00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:43.970
printed circuit board yourself and
order your own, that might,

572
00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:47.900
that might have some, some
value, but this is something

573
00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:50.270
I've always been frustrated as,
as a kid, I'd buy

574
00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:52.820
these like educational, electronic kits
and you get a bunch

575
00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:54.590
of components and you get
a printed circuit board and

576
00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:56.210
you'd it, the components under
the board, and it would

577
00:28:56.210 --> 00:29:02.270
just work and you wouldn't
learn anything. So that's, that's

578
00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:04.130
like the, I guess that's
sort of the, the reason

579
00:29:04.130 --> 00:29:06.380
that I really like the,
you know, build a computer

580
00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:09.290
on a breadboard idea of,
of, you know, this forces

581
00:29:09.290 --> 00:29:11.360
you to get every connection.
Right. And think about every

582
00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:13.850
connection and run into those
problems where you have two

583
00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:17.240
bits swapped and you aren't
getting the right result and

584
00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:19.190
you pull your hair out
for a couple hours trying

585
00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:20.990
to figure out why, and
then realize, Oh, I just

586
00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:23.630
had these two pins swapped
or whatever it is. I

587
00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:27.260
think there's value in that.
But it definitely comes with

588
00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:29.540
this downside of all. Now
there's just a whole bunch

589
00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:31.670
of connections that could potentially
be. Yeah. Yeah. There is

590
00:29:31.670 --> 00:29:35.090
a bit of psychic weight
that, what other things have

591
00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:37.760
I not found yet? And
I'll get another few hours

592
00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:39.650
in the next video and
discover that, well, you know,

593
00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:43.330
this, you know, whatever the
ReadWrite is SWAT or something,

594
00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:45.670
something silly like that. But
at the same time, I'm

595
00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:49.960
also noticing that there's a
certain temperament of a programmer

596
00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:52.690
where I have been frustrated,
but I haven't been, you

597
00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:55.510
know, slammed my hand on
the table, frustrated. It's been

598
00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:58.210
more of a contemplative wander
around the neighborhood, talking to

599
00:29:58.210 --> 00:30:03.240
myself, you know, Well, you
have to have that If

600
00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:06.360
you're a programmer and I
have very much enjoyed the,

601
00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:09.900
like, I don't think I
can do this right outside

602
00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:13.530
my comfort zone. I'm fully
over my head on this

603
00:30:13.530 --> 00:30:20.100
project, but still I rise.
Right. No, yeah, that's perfect.

604
00:30:20.910 --> 00:30:22.590
I appreciate that. One of
the other things that you

605
00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:24.780
did that I thought was
really cool was the use

606
00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:28.500
of an Arduino versus a
very expensive piece of machinery

607
00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:30.570
that I could potentially buy.
Maybe you could speak about

608
00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:32.790
why we throw an Arduino
in here, what that allows

609
00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:37.440
me to visualize. Yeah. So
if you're designing a digital

610
00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:40.080
logic circuit, and one of
the fundamental tools you would

611
00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:42.810
have in your, in your
toolbox is a logic analyzer,

612
00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:46.560
which is this thing that
has, you know, dozens of

613
00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:48.990
different probes that you can
put on different signals. And

614
00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:52.980
then it will essentially sample
the voltage levels on all

615
00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:54.750
of those signals and present
it to you on a,

616
00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:57.060
in some way that you
can sort of see what's

617
00:30:57.060 --> 00:31:00.390
going on. So, you know,
in, in a computer, like

618
00:31:00.570 --> 00:31:03.060
what we're building with the
65 Oh two project, you've

619
00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:05.310
got a 16 bit address
bus, you've got an eight

620
00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:08.070
bit data bus. And as
the computer is running, it's

621
00:31:08.130 --> 00:31:10.500
putting different addresses on the
address bus and it's reading

622
00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:13.830
or writing different data values
on the data bus. And

623
00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:16.350
so if you were building
this, or if you're engineering

624
00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:18.000
this thing, you might, you
might have a logic analyzer

625
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.930
hooked up to all those
different signals and being able

626
00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:25.170
to monitor them over time.
And then the logic analyzer

627
00:31:25.170 --> 00:31:26.940
will give you features about
being able to, you know,

628
00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:30.780
take those signals and view
them in, in hexadecimal or

629
00:31:30.810 --> 00:31:36.150
whatever format you want. And
I think you need something

630
00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:38.670
like that to really understand
what's going on with a

631
00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:41.430
computer or, or to debug.
I mean, the situation you

632
00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:43.680
had where you had a
bit swapped, if you had

633
00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:48.240
continued down the path and
built IO and hooked a

634
00:31:48.270 --> 00:31:51.450
little LCD screen or something
up to it, and then

635
00:31:51.450 --> 00:31:53.700
it, and you still had
that, those pin swapped, you

636
00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:55.590
would, I don't know how
you would find that, that

637
00:31:55.590 --> 00:32:00.420
error without some type of
logic analyzer, but for someone

638
00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:02.340
to be able to do
this project, you know, I

639
00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:04.380
think it's a tall order
to say, Oh, buy a

640
00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:09.060
$300 logic analyzer thousand dollar
logic analyzer or something. So

641
00:32:09.870 --> 00:32:13.140
because the computers running so
slow, you can actually use

642
00:32:13.210 --> 00:32:15.960
an Arduino that has the
same number of data pins

643
00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:19.950
as a effectively as a
logic analyzer and just feed

644
00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:21.720
in all of those, all
of those bits. You want

645
00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:24.720
to monitor into digital inputs
on the Arduino and then

646
00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:26.550
have the Arduino just tell
you what's on each of

647
00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:29.220
those pins. And, you know,
the Arduino is not going

648
00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:31.590
to be able to read
as quickly as a logic

649
00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:33.630
analyzer could, but that's fine.
Cause we can just slow

650
00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:36.240
down the computer. Right, Right.
And I've got a potential

651
00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:38.640
amateur on the clock module
and I've turned it down

652
00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:42.560
to a, you know, heartbeat
tempo, and I've effectively got

653
00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:46.100
a real time logging system.
And what's nice about it

654
00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:49.610
is that, you know, Arduinos
are, you know, extensively, low

655
00:32:49.610 --> 00:32:51.350
level, but really quite high
level. And you can write

656
00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:53.150
some very high level code
to say, all right, I'm

657
00:32:53.150 --> 00:32:54.500
going to do this on
the rising edge. And I'm

658
00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:55.910
going to check for high
on that and low on

659
00:32:55.910 --> 00:32:59.900
that. And in about 13,
14 lines of code, I'm

660
00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:03.170
literally looking at that voltage.
And when I was seeing

661
00:33:03.170 --> 00:33:07.970
that benign versus that AA
and without that Arduino, there's

662
00:33:07.970 --> 00:33:09.910
no way I would have
been, I don't even know

663
00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:11.390
you're right. I have no
idea how I would have

664
00:33:11.390 --> 00:33:13.610
figured that out. So let
me ask this kind of

665
00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:16.910
ignorant question because I've ordered
a better, a silver scope.

666
00:33:17.030 --> 00:33:20.180
So I can go and
look at one bit with

667
00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:23.180
a multi meter and I
can look at one bit

668
00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:26.420
over time as a voltage
with a silver scope and

669
00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:29.030
an L a logic analyzer
is kind of like both

670
00:33:29.030 --> 00:33:32.780
of those devices and times
over time with all of

671
00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:36.620
their potential inputs. Yeah. Something
like that. I was thinking,

672
00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:38.390
all right, I'm going to
run down and end up

673
00:33:38.390 --> 00:33:40.460
becoming an electrical engineer when
I'm done with all of

674
00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:45.050
this stuff. Oh, it's been
absolutely fascinating to do this.

675
00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:47.720
And I have only in
just a few minutes, I've

676
00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:50.120
been able to talk to
you, scratch the surface. The

677
00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:52.640
material that you've got up
on your YouTube is absolutely

678
00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:55.340
extraordinary. And I love that
you make it available for

679
00:33:55.340 --> 00:34:00.380
free folks can check out
your stuff@eater.net, the video tutorials,

680
00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:03.890
whether it be building AP
CPU from scratch the 65

681
00:34:03.890 --> 00:34:05.660
Oh two project that I'm
doing as well as some

682
00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:07.340
really amazing videos, we didn't
even get a chance to

683
00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:09.830
talk about like learning how
the internet works or you're

684
00:34:09.830 --> 00:34:12.680
assumed to be legendary. Let's
build a video card from

685
00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:16.340
scratch, which is really hot
on Reddit. People cannot believe

686
00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:18.440
that you're that you did
that. And that's absolutely an

687
00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:21.350
extraordinary video series as well.
I really appreciate you chatting

688
00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:23.720
with me today. We've been
talking with Ben eater. This

689
00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:26.920
is another episode of Hanselman
And we'll see you again

690
00:34:26.950 --> 00:34:38.980
next week. <inaudible>.
