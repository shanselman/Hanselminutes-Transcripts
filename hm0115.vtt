9
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.950
talk about the joy of
programming and getting back to

10
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:07.950
basics. Hey, guess what? This
is Carl Franklin, back on the

11
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.890
Hansel minutes with Scott Hanselman.
Good to be back Scott.

12
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.940
It's the, it's the return
of the Franklin. I'm thrilled

13
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.640
to have you back. Our,
our, our yearlong blood feud

14
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.200
is finally Come on, man.
People are gonna say stuff

15
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.890
about that. No, I'm just
kidding. No, I just, I

16
00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.620
started, when I started working
at Microsoft, I started going

17
00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.750
to a lot of conferences
and I would meet people

18
00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.120
in the hallway and I
would say, Oh dude, we

19
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.060
have to do it. And
it's been great. You've gotten

20
00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.490
a lot of great stuff.
I've been listening. It's been

21
00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:38.810
a pretty good run and
we've been having a lot

22
00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.250
of fun and, you know,
and you meet certain people

23
00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.480
and you just say, we've
got to do a show.

24
00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.820
Next thing you know, I
blink and a couple of

25
00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.870
months has gone by, without,
without Carl and people like

26
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.880
what's going on. Where's Carl.
Yeah. Well, you know, we've,

27
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.820
we've all got our lives,
our busy lives. And so

28
00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.710
it's good to, it's good
to be back talking to

29
00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.870
you again. We're going to
talk today about the joy

30
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.950
of programming. Yeah. And I
think that maybe a return

31
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.570
to the basics, because I
think that's some of the

32
00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.390
fun aspects of this, This
something Richard and I have

33
00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.740
been talking about recently, we've
recorded now, Don and rock

34
00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.100
shows all the way into
July. We've got a whole

35
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.320
bunch of them stacked up,
cause this is the conference

36
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.370
season, you know? Right. But
I was just, we were

37
00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.750
just talking lately about how,
you know, back in the

38
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.240
older days of dot and
Iraq's, we were really talking

39
00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.360
more about the technology and
about the things that the

40
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.450
technology did, just like some
of the basic fundamental stuff,

41
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.570
which is where I, I
see a lot of people,

42
00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.940
you know, a lot of
people who are new to.net,

43
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.270
obviously there are, we've got
a lot of newbies every

44
00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.020
day coming into.net and they
don't have, they didn't, they

45
00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.750
didn't grow up with us,
you know, as we sort

46
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.630
of progressed from just trying
to figure out this technology

47
00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.900
to the more abstract things.
And now we're seems like

48
00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.950
we're a little ivory tower
ish these days. So it's

49
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.500
good to get back to
them. I think six, when

50
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.190
someone says newbie, there's always
that implication, that that's a

51
00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.860
bad thing. I mean, if
I, if I started programming

52
00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.350
in scale out tomorrow, I
would be a newbie and

53
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.520
that's okay. Totally. I think
that computer science fundamentals though,

54
00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.820
are our computer science fundamentals.
And I think that I

55
00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.100
was always frustrated when people
would give me a hassle

56
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.350
about my interview questions. You
know, I wrote that big,

57
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.160
long blog post years ago
about top, you know, dot

58
00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.250
net interview.net interview questions that
everyone should be able to

59
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.410
answer. Yeah, I got a
bunch of vacuums, you know,

60
00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.420
you're an elitist, no one
should know, no one should

61
00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.550
know those things. And some
of them I thought were

62
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.330
pretty basic computer science type
stuff. And they'll always be

63
00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.490
the people that think that
one person is trying to

64
00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.240
promote, you know, memorizing MSDN
as a, as a, as

65
00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.550
a way to get job
security. But I, I think

66
00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.270
that we, the dotnet community
could all use a little

67
00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.980
refresher course on the basics.
Absolutely. You know, basics of

68
00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.290
old basics of interface design,
and get back to the

69
00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.610
patterns, start rereading our Fowler
books and rereading our gang

70
00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.670
of four stuff. Yeah. You
know, that's why I try

71
00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.070
to do the weekly source
code, you know, reading as

72
00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.410
much code as I can
because I really believe that

73
00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.100
you become a better programmer
by reading great programmers code.

74
00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.800
You know, you don't become
a good, a good book

75
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.860
writer by writing more books.
I think you have to

76
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:23.160
read as many as possible.
You know, when I was

77
00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.430
just learning to program, you
know, it was back in

78
00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.780
what, 84, 85, you know,
or my father's TRS 80

79
00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.410
model for, you know, the
cartoon guide to computer science.

80
00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.260
And I had the operating
system commands and the, in

81
00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.530
the programming language and I
just locked myself in the

82
00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.410
room. And, and I was
just so into the whole

83
00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.280
idea of, you know, making
this archaic little box, do

84
00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.600
something that, you know, would
be perceived as wizardry, you

85
00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.770
know, and always got in.
I'll always was into two

86
00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:01.170
things, communications and audio always
throughout my whole entire career.

87
00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:04.890
Those two, those two things
have really sort of been

88
00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.010
the backbone of everything I
love to do with computers.

89
00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.040
And I've been lucky that
I've been able to do

90
00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.100
what I love, you know,
whether it's programming or music

91
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:18.480
or whatever, but I don't
know, every once in a

92
00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.540
while you run into people
who have lost the joy

93
00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.310
and every once in a
while, it happens to us

94
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.250
too. We get caught up
in our jobs and the

95
00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:30.360
things that we have to
do. And so, so I

96
00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.220
wanted to talk when I'm
talking to you here, I

97
00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.200
want to tell you a
couple of things about what

98
00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.110
I really don't like character
traits that I don't like

99
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.750
in people or behaviors that
I don't like in people

100
00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.390
in this business. So this
is very odd for me

101
00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:45.390
to be complaining about stuff,
but I'm not really, I'm

102
00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:48.840
just pointing out behaviors. I
don't like when I exhibit

103
00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.600
them and when other people
exhibit them, right. And one

104
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.350
of them, one of them
is pretense. Pretension just drives

105
00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:59.900
me. Absolutely crazy. Just the,
of griping, whining, you know,

106
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:06.050
preoccupied, pretentious kind of stuff.
You know, and the antithesis

107
00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:08.990
of that is the, the
mentors that I had, if

108
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:10.910
it weren't for them, if
it weren't for the people

109
00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:14.600
who actually loved to share
their knowledge and you know,

110
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.690
we're happy to, to answer
any questions and not make

111
00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:19.760
you feel like an idiot,
if it weren't for those

112
00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.270
people, I might not have
gotten into it. I mean,

113
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.480
those people were as vital
in the early stages of

114
00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.920
my, of my career. Think
about how many people out

115
00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:33.370
there that are dotnet newbies
that could have one or

116
00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:36.460
two lousy experiences that could
be something as simple as

117
00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:40.180
someone being really cruel to
them in a forum or

118
00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:43.840
something more complicated. Like they
weren't able to find what

119
00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.660
they wanted on, you know,
using a search engine. Right.

120
00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.830
All of those things add
up to pushing them down,

121
00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.990
you know, and saying, you
know, maybe this isn't for

122
00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:56.200
you and you have to
be really careful. I think

123
00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.330
as people, just the fact
that we're listening to a

124
00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.610
podcast right now, I think
puts us in some top

125
00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:04.690
tier of people who care.
And I think that what

126
00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:07.570
can we do to make
sure that the new folks

127
00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:10.540
and the folks that are
at risk, the, at risk

128
00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:13.690
youth of dotnet who may
very well be 30, 40,

129
00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:16.030
50 years old, but you
know, the new people, what

130
00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:17.620
can we do to make
sure that they don't have

131
00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:22.060
those lousy experiences? Yeah. Well,
I mean, you know, you

132
00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:25.660
do what we do, which
is to just be completely

133
00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:30.400
open and sharing about what
we know. And, and one

134
00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.280
thing that I try to
encourage in people is to

135
00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.770
ask questions, you know, no
matter, you know, don't, don't

136
00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:39.340
make your, don't feel stupid
because you have a question.

137
00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:41.740
There's no such thing as
a dumb question. And this

138
00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:44.110
is why I really disliked
the behavior of sort of

139
00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:46.660
putting people down for asking
a question, you know what

140
00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:51.610
I'm saying? Yeah. And that
just drives. That's funny. I

141
00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:55.120
had an interesting kind of
discussion slash I wouldn't say

142
00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:58.330
an argument, but a discussion
with my wife where you

143
00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:03.100
know how wives can remember
stuff forever. Right. So, yeah,

144
00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:06.730
1972, when you asked me
if this, if this, when

145
00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:08.270
I asked you if this
dress made me look fat.

146
00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:10.720
Yeah. So, yeah, so we're
driving, we're driving to the

147
00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.990
movies. And she says out
of the blue, she's like,

148
00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:16.840
you know, about six years
ago. And I was like,

149
00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:19.870
Oh, no, six years ago
we were at a conference.

150
00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:22.540
I brought her along with
me and a guy came

151
00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:26.320
up and asked you a
question after, after a presentation.

152
00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.680
And this is my wife
talking to me. And she

153
00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:33.310
said, and you said, by
asking that question, you're, you're

154
00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:34.990
telling me that you really
have no idea what you're

155
00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:37.750
doing. And it was like,
you know, you're hearing your

156
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:40.030
own words coming back to
you. Right. Right. And I

157
00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:44.320
want it to die. Right.
Just cause, cause I remember

158
00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.990
that actually, you know, I,
it was one, it wasn't

159
00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:50.320
necessarily an example of, you
know, six years ago, something

160
00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.360
I don't remember in my
wife does, but this is

161
00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:55.150
one of those things where
it was a perfect storm

162
00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:58.650
of bad day. Yeah. And
then someone comes up and

163
00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:01.530
asks you some question like,
so XML, is that going

164
00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:04.440
to replace Java? Yeah. Something
and then, and then you

165
00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:07.560
snap at them. Yeah. And
you just, and years later,

166
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:10.340
half a decade later, I
am, I am cringing. You

167
00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:13.400
got the blue. Meanies keep
that up. Yeah. That, that

168
00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:17.300
is it. That was a
defining moment for me where

169
00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:20.870
I really try not to
be a jerk. Right. When

170
00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:25.730
people are asking a dumb
question, isn't the right word.

171
00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:27.770
You know, just to know,
it's funny how it's just

172
00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:30.200
the basic and uninformed is
such a nicer way to

173
00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.200
phrase it than ignorant because
ignorant has become a really

174
00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:38.030
bad, painful way to phrase
uninformed. Cause, cause I am

175
00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:40.730
decidedly uninformed on a number
of things for me to

176
00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:44.090
think it's okay. Absolutely. There,
there are lots of things

177
00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:47.870
in this, in, in.net development
that I really don't have

178
00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:51.080
interest in that. Well, and
recognizing that is so important.

179
00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.630
I mean, recognizing that, you
know, I have no idea

180
00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:59.540
about XYZ or, or even
more realizing that you've forgotten

181
00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:01.790
it. Right. You know, like
I got a question, I

182
00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.640
got a question in the
email recently about, about WCF

183
00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:09.950
windows, communication foundation. And you
know, it's been eight months

184
00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:12.800
since I've been thinking deeply
about that. And frankly, I

185
00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:17.090
don't know what the current,
you know, May, 2008 thoughts are

186
00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:19.910
around WCF. So I told
the guy what I thought,

187
00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:21.950
but I said, listen, I
don't know if this is

188
00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:24.890
the current thinking right now.
So, you know, B the

189
00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:26.150
B the B the F
you know, the way to

190
00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:27.470
be the smartest man in
the room is to be

191
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:31.430
the first to say, I
don't know. Absolutely. Absolutely. I

192
00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:34.250
usually assume that I am
not the smartest man in

193
00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:37.070
the room, especially if Rory
is in the room with

194
00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:41.270
me. Yeah. Yeah. There's this
other behavior that is, is

195
00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:45.920
very similar, which is sort
of, you see people who,

196
00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:51.140
who have this realm of
knowledge about a particular technology

197
00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:57.230
or something that's very specific.
Right. And they feel they're

198
00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:01.190
experts in that topic and
they may be experts in

199
00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:04.790
that topic. And then, you
know, to, to sit on

200
00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:08.000
the high horse and, you
know, and tell everybody else

201
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.040
that, unless they're doing it
their way, then they, you

202
00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:12.770
know, thinking the way that
they think about it, then,

203
00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:15.380
you know, they're wrong. This
sort of black and white

204
00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:18.260
sort of be a little
thing of peop of their

205
00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:23.480
peers, really, because they're doing
something differently. And I don't

206
00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:26.660
see SA I don't, I
mean, some software is an

207
00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:31.190
exact science, there are some
things that scientifically can be

208
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:36.800
done. Right. And that's it,
but more often there's so

209
00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:40.430
many different permutations of ways
in architectures of ways to

210
00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:44.720
do things that, that I,
I, I just find that

211
00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:48.650
completely pretentious. It's really difficult
to tell him, you know,

212
00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:52.790
what I want, what I
want is instead of always

213
00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:57.100
do, you know, because I
said, so what I want

214
00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:00.280
is a discussion of why
I want to know why,

215
00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:03.100
and I want to know
what the alternatives are and

216
00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:05.950
what the pros and cons
are. And that's the kind

217
00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:07.210
of discussion that I want
to have, so I can

218
00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:10.230
make a, my own mind.
Yeah. And I've found when

219
00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:13.920
working with, with, with newer
programmers, that rather than focusing

220
00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:17.100
so much on what you
should do and patterns, which

221
00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:21.570
are basically declarations of correctness,
that trying to think about

222
00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:25.140
things in the inverse, thinking
about anti-patterns right. Saying that

223
00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:27.450
I don't know what the
right solution is, but I

224
00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:29.220
know what not to do,
because I know what not

225
00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:31.500
to do exactly. Because you
know, this young person that

226
00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:34.530
I'm supposed to be mentoring
may very well have a

227
00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:37.980
better solution in his head,
his or her head. And

228
00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:40.020
they may come up with
an elegant solution that I

229
00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:43.440
never even thought of. So
it would be presumptuous of

230
00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:46.020
me to, to indicate that
this is the way to

231
00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:47.940
do it, but I can
pretty much say this is

232
00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:49.380
not the way to do
it. You know? And that's

233
00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:51.330
where you start getting into
basis of computer science. It

234
00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:54.540
starts saying that, you know,
this doubly nested or tripling

235
00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:58.170
nested for loop won't scale
beyond a certain number of

236
00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:01.170
items in the list, therefore,
this is what has tables

237
00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:06.090
are for. And, you know,
so here's the anti-pattern Yeah.

238
00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:10.200
Getting back to this whole
loving what you do. Thing

239
00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:15.510
I, I just really can't
imagine not being able to,

240
00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:18.450
to, to program the way
that I, not the way

241
00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:20.490
that I like to, just
to program, to write code.

242
00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:22.410
I mean, and that's why
I did it in the

243
00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:24.480
first place is because I
loved it. You know what

244
00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:27.360
I mean? Or your recent
DNR TV that you did

245
00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:33.030
with middy, you hooked up
a.net remoting and a freaking

246
00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:36.210
piano keyboard so that you
could control a player, piano

247
00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:38.910
remotely. And I was just
like, you had such an

248
00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:40.800
excitement in your voice while
you were, while you were

249
00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.560
doing this, just like, Oh
Lord, this is how Carl

250
00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:45.840
spends his weekends. And I'm
thinking to myself, what are

251
00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:48.510
my hobbies? I don't really
have any, but it's hooking

252
00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:51.000
up maybe to a player.
Piano sounds like a pretty

253
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.990
good time to Totally useless,
but it's impressive. It's not

254
00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:58.620
useful at all, but it's
a, It's fun. It's fun.

255
00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:01.140
Exactly. That's what it is.
I mean, I've got, I've

256
00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:04.320
spent more time getting the
baby cams to work so

257
00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:06.030
that I can see my
sons, you know, when they're

258
00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:08.610
sleeping and make sure that,
you know, he hasn't pushed

259
00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:11.310
a pillow over his head
or whatever, you know, you

260
00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:12.840
get a five month old,
you worry about these things.

261
00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:14.700
So I've spent the last
five months trying to get

262
00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:19.770
the baby webcam just right.
Right. But, you know, and

263
00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:21.600
I really am hoping to
pass that, that kind of

264
00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:26.550
joy on onto them, the
joy of construction. Yeah. I

265
00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:28.020
guess that's really the, what
it is. It's a joy,

266
00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:30.480
it's the joy of creation,
whether you're an artist or

267
00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:34.110
whether you're a person who
works with absolutely that's creation.

268
00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:38.430
And when I meet people,
I'm realizing more and more

269
00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:42.270
that people I can't re
relate to are those who

270
00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:45.420
don't have that excitement about
how I can make that,

271
00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:47.340
you know, what it is.
I realize what it is.

272
00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:51.350
It's the sense of, of
empowerment. When I go, when

273
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:53.360
I go and talk to
middle schools and high schools

274
00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:57.200
about, about software, one of
the, the kind of the

275
00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:01.550
standard, my standard middle school
presentation involves opening up notepad

276
00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:03.950
and typing in the alphabet.
And then we go down

277
00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:06.410
to debug dot exe. And
we look at, you know,

278
00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:08.600
how those, we know what's
a bit, what's a bite.

279
00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:13.100
How did ABCD get, get
represented? And then we go

280
00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:14.750
all the way up over
about an hour, hour and

281
00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:16.940
a half talk and tell
most kids, attention span has

282
00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:19.460
gone. And we get to
the point where we show

283
00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:22.220
them how an MP3 is
encoded. Yeah. Or I'll go

284
00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:24.200
into a, you know, a
fun, a fun example for

285
00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:26.600
a 10 year old is
to open up paint and

286
00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:30.260
draw a bunch of colored
squares, red, red, green, blue,

287
00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:33.320
right. And then show them
how that gets red, green,

288
00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:35.810
blue, and coded on disc.
And you know, when you

289
00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:40.160
do this, maybe 20% of
them goes, Oh, and then

290
00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.980
suddenly you can, you can
almost hear the neurons firing.

291
00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:45.980
Right. It's such a wonderful
thing. And they suddenly figure

292
00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:48.800
out that their TiVo has
an, has a hard drive

293
00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:51.260
in it. Right. And that
hard drive works pretty much

294
00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:55.400
like a, an RCA Victor
standard turntable did 80 years

295
00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:59.030
ago. Yeah. And it all,
all the world connects. And

296
00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:01.970
then the other 80% has
this very kind of like,

297
00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:05.990
yeah, that's, that's kind of
cool. And I guess that's

298
00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:09.080
fine. And they won't be
constructors. Maybe there'll be, I

299
00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:12.650
don't know, marketers or suits
of some kind. But man,

300
00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:16.220
you know, when people who
create are so much more

301
00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:21.470
healthy and, and enthusiastic about
life, I've got a great

302
00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:24.500
friend of mine who is
a programmer. And I just

303
00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:26.600
assumed he programmed in his
spare time, I went over

304
00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.250
to his house and he
opened up his garage and

305
00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:33.770
it was this amazing shop
for woodworking. Nice. And I

306
00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:37.790
realized this guy has to
create right. Whether it's software

307
00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:39.590
or whether it's, you know,
and you go over to

308
00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:40.730
his house and he's like,
Oh yeah, I made that

309
00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:43.130
table. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
You know, the kids needed

310
00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:46.010
a chair. So I made
that. Right. What a sense

311
00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:48.230
of empowerment one was to
have. I mean, I can't,

312
00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:51.560
I can't hang a picture.
Yeah. Although if I do,

313
00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.540
of course I use, I
use lasers to do it

314
00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:56.950
though. You get the same
spark of creating, you know,

315
00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:00.670
arranged electrons. So yeah. Yeah,
exactly. Isn't that funny though?

316
00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:04.630
The electrons are there, they're
cheaper than a distribute, cheaper

317
00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:07.210
than molecules, but there's a
lot of work to put

318
00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:10.450
together some molecules that's right.
I'm always impressed. You know,

319
00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:12.820
it's interesting too. It'd be
interesting to hear from the

320
00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:15.670
listeners what their hobbies are.
And if there is a

321
00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:19.990
parallel between the personality type,
that they are the fact

322
00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:22.480
that they are creating with
software and what they have

323
00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:27.850
created, that is not software.
Do you know how to

324
00:17:27.850 --> 00:17:30.910
make the possible out of
the impossible? Well, the dotnet

325
00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:33.730
ninjas at Telerik do they
just released a huge pack

326
00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:35.980
of web controls, all built
on top of ESPN at

327
00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:40.210
Ajax, that'll help you build
impossibly fast and interactive applications

328
00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:43.570
in no time at all.
They've made the impossible possible

329
00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:46.630
in desktop development. If you
think you can't have a

330
00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:49.980
carousel component and wind forms,
well you can, they're windows

331
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:52.920
form suite features a super
powerful grid, view control, and

332
00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:55.980
32 other crazy desktop components.
That'll give you a dazzling

333
00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:00.120
WPF like features, but in
wind farms, they do the

334
00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:02.520
same thing in reporting solutions
with a new design surface,

335
00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:05.220
like nothing else looks just
like graph paper gives you

336
00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:08.910
advanced page layout capabilities makes
it feel more like a

337
00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:11.910
graphic design software than a
reporting solution. Go check them

338
00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:14.340
out at <inaudible> dot com
and be a dotnet Ninja.

339
00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:17.690
And thanks for listening, You
know, I've said this before

340
00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:21.410
on various shows, but I
think, and especially for men,

341
00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:24.350
right, because you know, you
wonder why a lot of

342
00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:27.890
software developers are men. Most
of them, I sort of

343
00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:30.320
have this theory and it's
kind of wacky, but I

344
00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:33.830
have this theory that since,
you know, a man's role

345
00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:37.940
biologically in repro and reproduction
is very limited. You know,

346
00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:40.610
it's really the woman who
creates life. I mean, she,

347
00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:44.480
yeah, She's involved. Yeah, yeah.
Involved for very short periods

348
00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:49.040
of time. And then this
is a way that you,

349
00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:52.460
we can sort of create
an intelligence. You know, it's

350
00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:54.980
almost, if you look at
it biologically, you know, what

351
00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:59.480
motivates us to, to, to
create software, it is sort

352
00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:01.160
of, I mean, when you
write programs, they are sort

353
00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:03.260
of like little children. You
have to sort of maintain

354
00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:05.720
them and help them grow
up. And you know, they,

355
00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:09.230
you see them get smarter
and smarter and then they

356
00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:12.050
stopped growing and then you
visit them in the nursing

357
00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:14.900
home from time to time.
But, but, you know, and

358
00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:18.350
I had a, a woman
friend who was a developer

359
00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:20.840
and I told her this
theory and she said, Hm,

360
00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:25.820
interesting. And then we were
talking about, you know, do

361
00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:29.270
you have children? She says,
no, I had a hysterectomy.

362
00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:35.300
I can't have children. Hmm.
Isn't that interesting woman programmer

363
00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:38.900
can't have children. Wow. So
I don't know if this

364
00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:40.970
is going to cause a
controversy or if we're going

365
00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:43.970
to be talking about, I
wasn't exactly the direction I

366
00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:45.680
thought you were going. But
what I'm hearing you say

367
00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:48.110
is that here was a
person who was unable to

368
00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:50.990
create in some way, but
found an outlet regarding Plus

369
00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:55.310
could not create an intelligence.
You know, couldn't reproduce and

370
00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:58.070
found, found a way to
do that. I mean, it's

371
00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:02.090
a weird, wild, deep rooted
theory than I have. And

372
00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:04.220
it might be total BS,
but I'd like to hear

373
00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:06.950
what iPad. I think that
our, our, our many female

374
00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:11.690
listeners, yeah. I certainly do
not mean to offend, you

375
00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:13.580
know, the other, the other
thing that I like to

376
00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:17.780
do creative wise is putting
machines together. I love buying.

377
00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:20.150
Yeah. I love going to
new egg and ordering up

378
00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:23.540
the parts, getting boxes and
unpacking them and putting the

379
00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:27.500
machine together and installing the
software. I love that. That's

380
00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:29.060
one of my favorite things
to do in the whole

381
00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:31.400
world. You know, you know
why I like doing that

382
00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:33.680
too. It's funny. I like
doing that. I like putting

383
00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:37.580
together a fresh machine because
it's hard, but it's not

384
00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:41.600
difficult. Right. You know, it's
not oppressively. You gotta know

385
00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:44.300
what you're doing, but it's
not the unknown. It's not

386
00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:47.150
like you're paving new ground.
Right. It's a relaxing Saturday

387
00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:51.820
afternoon. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, exactly.
It's the difference between designing

388
00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:54.880
and building a new engine
versus changing the oil on

389
00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:57.970
your existing car? Right. One
can be very relaxing because

390
00:20:57.970 --> 00:21:01.480
you know that it requires
some amount of skill, but

391
00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:03.610
not so much skill that
it's going to have you

392
00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:06.660
racking your brain. Unless of
course you get some sort

393
00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:09.780
of strange bios problem that
is causing the screening. But

394
00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:12.360
I tell you, you know,
I just, just last week

395
00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:15.930
I had like the first
blue screen in my, on

396
00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:18.600
my quad PC, the super
PC we built with Jeff

397
00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:21.330
Atwood. Right. I have my
first blue screen, you know,

398
00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:24.240
like ever, and I was
freaking out and I was

399
00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:25.740
like, what is going on?
I've turned out to be

400
00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:28.700
some software that I installed
driver or something. It was,

401
00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:32.490
it was VMware. And I
removed it and everything's back.

402
00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:34.110
And I mean, this was
a machine that stays up

403
00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:37.140
for months. You know, I
reboot this machine, you know,

404
00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:41.580
on the, on the solstices,
but rarely, rarely else. And

405
00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:44.070
I have to say that
it is a constant source

406
00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:45.930
of pride that Jeff and
I were able to put

407
00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:48.060
this thing together and he
helped me get it to

408
00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:52.080
two rock solid. Yeah. I
can do, I can do

409
00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:55.770
24 hour renders of videos
that I do. And I

410
00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:57.690
have no concern at all
that this thing is going

411
00:21:57.690 --> 00:21:59.760
to blow up when I
wake up the next morning.

412
00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:02.970
Yep. The machine is the
same way. My piece that

413
00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:05.970
I put together, Nothing, there
were years when I would

414
00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:07.860
wake up and find a
machine that blue screen in

415
00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:10.980
the middle of the night,
what a horrible feeling. Yep.

416
00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:13.410
So, yeah, I think that
putting together machines is a

417
00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:16.620
really good way for people
to not only relax, but

418
00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:19.500
to also, you know, indirectly
learn more about how hardware

419
00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:21.660
works. The kids are young
yet, but I mean, this

420
00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:23.640
is something that I like
to share with my older

421
00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:27.090
daughter is putting the machine
together, showing how it works,

422
00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:29.790
how it goes together. I
think that's a really great

423
00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:32.220
thing. I'm really looking forward
to that. I, I went

424
00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:35.040
and bought a kit, a
little, a little wood kit

425
00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:38.670
who was basically like a
toy screwdriver and screws and

426
00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:41.430
some blocks. And, you know,
a miracle happens in a

427
00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:44.280
dump, a dump truck comes
out of it and I'm

428
00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:46.620
Zen. So my son is
two and a half. And

429
00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:49.680
I think I maybe it's
about two years too soon.

430
00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:52.410
Yeah. I tried though. I
really thought that we could

431
00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:55.680
build this, but his attention
span was too limited, but

432
00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:57.570
the wife noticed, and she's
like, you just really want

433
00:22:57.570 --> 00:22:59.340
to take him into the
garage and build something. Don't

434
00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:02.190
you. If I didn't think
he would take a hammer

435
00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:05.130
directly into the wall and
destroy the house, I would

436
00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:06.780
love to give this guy
a hammer and nails and

437
00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:08.910
see what he could do
with a, with a two

438
00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:14.070
by four. We'll see though,
maybe he's not a creator.

439
00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:17.460
Maybe he's a connector or
maybe he's a nurturer or

440
00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:21.090
some other kind of personal
All your years at Karelian

441
00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:26.040
you were mr. ASP, net
web guy. Was there ever

442
00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:29.520
a time where you regretted
the fact that you chose

443
00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:31.740
this line of work? I
mean, where, where you just

444
00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:37.280
got so oppressively, unfun that,
that you, that you, you

445
00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:39.450
were just like, Oh, this
is, you know, why did

446
00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:42.170
I, why did I sign
up for this? Yeah, yeah.

447
00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:45.150
Yeah. I, I, it's funny.
I actually go through a

448
00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:48.740
crisis of conscience usually about
once a year. Yeah. It's

449
00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:53.330
usually when, when, when nothing
works, it's usually when my

450
00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:57.860
body is breaking down. When,
when, when, when this line

451
00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:00.620
of work is beginning to
physically hurt me. Oh, okay.

452
00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:04.160
You know, people who are
this kind of personality, the

453
00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:07.130
creator personality, I think obsessed.
Cause they want it to

454
00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:11.300
be right. Right. And that
involves sitting in uncomfortable positions,

455
00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:13.940
cramped for very long periods
of time. Yeah. And that

456
00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:18.290
adds up into unhealthy aspects
of, of your body. I

457
00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:20.510
get, I've got a bad
back and I've got bad

458
00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:22.610
hands. And I keep thinking
of my, well, I was

459
00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:24.670
talking to Richard Campbell last week
and he's got, you know,

460
00:24:24.670 --> 00:24:27.620
he's maybe getting arthritis in
his fingers, you know? Yeah.

461
00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:30.140
All programmers can tell you
a story about like, Oh

462
00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:31.880
yeah. And this finger just
doesn't work. Like it used

463
00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:33.720
to what's that one do.
Oh, that's the, that's the

464
00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:35.830
enter key. I find that,
you know, I'm a guitar

465
00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:38.950
player. And I find that
if I'm coding for too

466
00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:40.870
long, and then I go
to try to play guitar,

467
00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:43.870
it takes me a good
hour to limber up before

468
00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:46.900
I can actually start playing.
Right. And I also find

469
00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:50.530
that since, you know, when
I was coding a lot

470
00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:53.530
and then I would go
play one of my, my

471
00:24:53.530 --> 00:24:58.240
middle finger on my left
hand actually froze in a

472
00:24:58.270 --> 00:25:01.000
knee at a 90 degree
angle while I was playing

473
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.850
one night I was playing.
So, I mean, I guess

474
00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:06.520
I was playing it hard,
which I, I tend to

475
00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:09.010
press down hard on the
frets anyway. And just at

476
00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:13.420
the first knuckle, you know,
there's, there's basically two knuckles

477
00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:15.760
in your middle finger. And
at the bottom knuckle, it

478
00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:18.190
just was bent and would
not move up. And I

479
00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:20.470
looked at Jay and I
was like, dude, I can't

480
00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:23.050
play anymore. Look. And I
held at my finger and

481
00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:24.910
you know, my middle finger
was bent at a 90

482
00:25:24.910 --> 00:25:27.220
degree angle and I couldn't
move it back. It was

483
00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:29.680
just like, It's funny. I
am having that problem right

484
00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:33.430
now. My, my right hand,
my middle finger locks up

485
00:25:33.670 --> 00:25:36.040
bent fully in the middle
of the night. And it

486
00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:40.030
just, who knows. And yeah,
well, who knows? I blame

487
00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:42.400
computers. Maybe it's time to
break out the data hand.

488
00:25:42.910 --> 00:25:44.530
Yeah. I think it's, I
think it's time to break

489
00:25:44.530 --> 00:25:46.180
out the voice recognition, but
I would like to borrow

490
00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:49.120
your, your data hand keyboard
though at some point. But

491
00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:51.040
yeah. I mean, those kinds
of things when one wants

492
00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:53.530
to create, but one cannot,
it's really difficult. I just

493
00:25:53.530 --> 00:25:56.530
watched this movie called the
diving bell and the butterfly.

494
00:25:56.710 --> 00:25:59.320
Hmm. Have you seen this?
This is about a Frenchman

495
00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:03.280
who was a paralyzed. He
had a stroke. And the

496
00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:06.460
only thing that worked was
one eye. It's a real

497
00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:11.800
story. And he a jaw
joint, Phillipe, Bodhi, I think

498
00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:15.220
was his name. And he
was like a famous editor

499
00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:19.180
at like Vogue or something
had this stroke and was

500
00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:22.660
locked in. He has locked
in syndrome. He died. And

501
00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:27.580
he wrote a book using
just his eye. Basically they

502
00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:29.860
would read letters to him
in the, in the order

503
00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:33.190
of frequency. Wow. They go,
they go E a S

504
00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:34.990
T and he would blink
when he needed, got the

505
00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:37.960
letter he wanted. Huh. And
he wrote an entire book

506
00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:40.120
it's called the diving bell
and the butterfly. This was

507
00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:42.220
a guy who had to
create, he had to get,

508
00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:45.740
he had to justify How
long it took didn't matter

509
00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:49.040
because the creation process itself
was very enjoyable. Right. So

510
00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:51.470
apparently what he would do
is he would memorize the

511
00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:56.150
passages the night before and
memorize them and then sleep.

512
00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:58.100
And then when he woke
up the next day, he

513
00:26:58.100 --> 00:27:01.280
would basically take his, his
dictation assistant, which was a

514
00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:03.590
person who would read this
to him and he would

515
00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:07.060
blink and they would take
down dictation and, and they'd

516
00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:09.740
try to auto-complete the words
as best they could. And

517
00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:13.070
he died just months after
the book was done. Wow.

518
00:27:13.790 --> 00:27:17.300
Yeah. Fascinating. I don't know
if I'm going to write

519
00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:19.730
code to that level where
I'm going to, you know,

520
00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:22.490
if I have only one
finger left, I will write

521
00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:25.400
C sharp with it. Right.
But I think that the,

522
00:27:25.570 --> 00:27:28.160
the point is though, is
that that personality type has

523
00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:30.500
to get their information out
into the world, whether anyone's

524
00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:32.150
listening or not. I really
got to get back to

525
00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:35.360
this whole mentor thing. You
know, that I can't stress

526
00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:38.150
enough. I mean, maybe that's
why I got into evangelism

527
00:27:38.150 --> 00:27:40.070
and I'm, I've really, you
know, got into training and

528
00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:43.250
teaching because I love seeing
the light go on. And,

529
00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:47.060
and I just want to
be that person that, you

530
00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:48.950
know, went out of their
way to help me when

531
00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:52.230
I needed it. And you
know, you, you get a

532
00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:54.530
person who's new to programming
in a room with a

533
00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:56.600
bunch of programmers that are
just doing their thing. It's

534
00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:59.810
pretty damn intimidating. And, you
know, even sitting around and

535
00:27:59.810 --> 00:28:02.660
listening to them, talk and
stuff, and they're just totally

536
00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:05.270
into what they're doing. And
you know, you ask them

537
00:28:05.270 --> 00:28:07.160
a question and they're like,
ah, what are you an

538
00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:10.670
idiot? You know, you don't,
you risk it's feeling that

539
00:28:10.670 --> 00:28:12.890
and putting you down and
stuff. And you're just trying

540
00:28:12.890 --> 00:28:15.620
to, you're just trying to
figure out some basic stuff.

541
00:28:15.650 --> 00:28:18.710
And I tell you, I
mean, it was real. No,

542
00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:20.750
I think it's like that
in any industry though. Like

543
00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:24.020
I always, I have this
theory that I call the

544
00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:27.980
top gun bar theory, which
is that in any vertical,

545
00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:31.190
in any industry, whether it
be computers or ice skating

546
00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:34.700
or karate or whatever, it's
the same story. It's the

547
00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:36.740
karate kid story. It's the
top gun story, which is,

548
00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:39.650
you know, new guy joins
in tough guys that are

549
00:28:39.650 --> 00:28:42.740
already there, give them a
hard time. They fight, they

550
00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:45.710
fight the struggle. New guy
proves that he can do

551
00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:47.990
it. And then at some
point in the bar where

552
00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:49.970
the, you know, where all
the tough guys hang out,

553
00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:52.820
one of the guys goes
over and kind of chucks

554
00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:54.560
him on the chin and
says you're all right kid.

555
00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:57.890
Yeah. You know, so I
think that, that, that, that

556
00:28:57.890 --> 00:28:59.960
would be cool. You know,
if, if one of my

557
00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:02.090
heroes, one of my programming
heroes would kind of come

558
00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:04.750
over and go, Hey, you're
all right. You're all right.

559
00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:07.220
And then we'd all go
to the bar and hang

560
00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:11.960
out and have beer nuts
or something. Right. I think

561
00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:13.310
everyone has it. I mean,
I bet you that there's

562
00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:16.070
like a knitting pool where
someone wants to get into

563
00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:18.200
knitting and they go, and
they, you know, they're really

564
00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:21.440
tough knitting, you know, the
ice man of knitting is

565
00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:23.060
really cruel to them. And
then at the end they

566
00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:25.400
think you're all right. Cause
you can knit. Yeah. Well,

567
00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:27.530
you know, like I said,
it's, it certainly is tough.

568
00:29:27.530 --> 00:29:30.590
And especially because not a
lot of the people who

569
00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:33.080
are knowledgeable about this stuff
tend to be just so

570
00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:35.360
focused and wrapped up into
what they're doing. But, you

571
00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:37.790
know, there was just some
very, very few very cool

572
00:29:37.790 --> 00:29:40.580
people back in the early
days who would actually sit

573
00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:42.850
down and, and, you know,
I gotta tell you, the

574
00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:45.520
guys at Crescent software were,
were like made a career

575
00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:47.920
out of that. They, where
I, where I cut my

576
00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:50.200
teeth back in the early
days, they, they would write

577
00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:53.320
assembly language routine. So you
could call from quick, basic,

578
00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:57.040
and they would put out
these free pamphlets about assembly,

579
00:29:57.040 --> 00:30:01.360
language, assembly, language primer, they
would comment and give away

580
00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:04.780
their assembly language source code.
They wanted people to know

581
00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:06.580
how to do it. And
it wasn't, you know, maybe

582
00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:09.370
it was because there was
a psychological need to do

583
00:30:09.370 --> 00:30:11.530
that. You know, that's how
they felt good about themselves

584
00:30:11.530 --> 00:30:15.520
or wherever, but okay, fine.
You're sharing your knowledge. You

585
00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:19.870
know, you're giving me inspiration
and it's great. It's a

586
00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:23.530
win, win. So, I mean,
I was that, those kinds

587
00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:26.200
of those kinds of relationships
and those kinds of people

588
00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:28.150
and companies that those are
the kinds of people I

589
00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:30.340
want to, you know, what
I'm teaching, right. When I'm

590
00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:33.610
teaching a class, there are
days that are, you know,

591
00:30:33.610 --> 00:30:35.470
the lights are on, but
nobody's home. I look out

592
00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:38.680
to a sea of gaping
eyes, you know, and they're

593
00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:41.650
just half falling asleep. Maybe
they're a little bored, whatever.

594
00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:44.710
And then there's one, one
guy up front or one

595
00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:48.340
girl up front. Who's like
looking up the ceiling and

596
00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:50.950
saying, Oh, okay, wait a
minute. Can you say that

597
00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:53.290
again? You know, and you
can see the, like the

598
00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:56.380
wheels going and it just
like, it clicks for them.

599
00:30:57.090 --> 00:31:00.480
Oh, I get, okay. So
yeah. It's so cool to

600
00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:03.570
hear that from, from someone,
because sometimes I, I think

601
00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:05.190
I'm the only one that
thinks that kind of stuff,

602
00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:08.040
but, and I always joke
sometimes in talks where I'll

603
00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:09.780
say, if I can just
save the life of one

604
00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:12.450
child. No. Yeah, absolutely. And
one in one doesn't mean

605
00:31:12.450 --> 00:31:14.520
to use the word child
in a diminutive, but it's

606
00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:16.230
just that we always hear
that growing up, but that's

607
00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:18.960
why people teach when you're
talking to a room of

608
00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:22.350
a thousand people and then
suddenly, you know, the guy

609
00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:25.380
who's clearly eager enough to
have sat in the front.

610
00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:27.690
And here's the thing. Those
are the people you want

611
00:31:27.690 --> 00:31:30.150
on your team. You know
what I mean? And he

612
00:31:30.150 --> 00:31:32.610
goes, you want people like
that because they're not afraid.

613
00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:35.040
They're not afraid to learn
and they're not afraid to

614
00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:38.700
show what they don't know.
And you know, the more

615
00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:42.030
they're asking these questions and
learning and stuff that, you

616
00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:44.820
know, they're going to surpass
the people who are just

617
00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:47.640
afraid to look stupid and
are therefore going to stay

618
00:31:48.210 --> 00:31:50.610
stupid. So what can we
do to make the community

619
00:31:50.610 --> 00:31:52.440
more friendly? I mean, like
a, like the, like, I

620
00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:55.440
think like the all.net movement
we've talked to these guys,

621
00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:57.150
we talked to Dave Larrabee
and the different folks that

622
00:31:57.150 --> 00:32:00.750
are there thinking about alternative
ways that are not necessarily

623
00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:04.440
the Microsoft standard way. They
have a lot to offer,

624
00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:10.400
but the barrier to entry
is really difficult. It's, it's

625
00:32:10.410 --> 00:32:14.340
not exactly the most something
that you jump into. And

626
00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:15.870
I get lots of emails
that say, well, how do

627
00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:17.430
I get started? How do
I get started? What can

628
00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:20.040
I do? What, where's the
book everyone's like, where's the

629
00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:22.650
book. I can read that.
Right. That magical thing. That's

630
00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:26.730
gonna make it snap. How
can we make, make it

631
00:32:26.730 --> 00:32:28.890
snap for people? I mean,
I think we do. I

632
00:32:28.890 --> 00:32:31.980
think just by having these
conversations, having these podcasts and

633
00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:36.390
talking and speaking and, and,
you know, being engaged and

634
00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:38.430
involved on our blogs and
things like this, I think

635
00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:41.090
we do make difference in
it. We get email to

636
00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:44.660
that effect all the time,
but I would like to

637
00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:47.990
encourage the listeners to be
that person, to be that

638
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:50.810
mentor, to actually, you know,
starting with a man in

639
00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:55.210
the mirror, change the world,
by changing yourself and, and

640
00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:59.240
being that sort of, you
know, champion. Cause it's literally,

641
00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:02.420
you will change people's lives.
You will save their lives.

642
00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:05.240
You will, people will owe
their career to you just

643
00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:08.030
by sharing a little bit
of time and knowledge and,

644
00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:11.470
and helping somebody not feel
stupid and over know. And

645
00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:13.490
I would say I would
extend that and say that

646
00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:16.760
you don't even have to
necessarily be an expert. And

647
00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:18.920
then certainly, you know, I
know some stuff, but I

648
00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:21.500
don't claim to be an
expert in many, many things,

649
00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:24.320
but just because you've been
in the business for a

650
00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:27.260
long time, and you're not,
you're not out of work

651
00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:30.020
and homeless. Right. It means
that you are doing something

652
00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:32.780
right. Yep. So you don't
necessarily have to be the

653
00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:36.710
best at X technology to,
to sit down with someone

654
00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:39.200
who's maybe just out of
college or only a couple

655
00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:40.910
of years in the industry
and help them out. But

656
00:33:40.910 --> 00:33:43.310
I mean, you know, you
said a good example by

657
00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:45.290
showing people how to learn
things when they don't know

658
00:33:45.290 --> 00:33:47.750
them and how to look
things up and you know

659
00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:51.500
where to go to get
good information and, and all

660
00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:55.220
of that. And just by
answering some simple questions, you

661
00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:57.920
never know. I mean, some
people will have a mental

662
00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:00.500
block about something and once
they get over that block,

663
00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:02.480
they realize, Oh, this isn't
so hard. I can do

664
00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:05.000
this. And then they're off,
you know, it could be

665
00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:10.100
just one thing. So yeah,
I think you're right. Well,

666
00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:13.760
I think that's a show.
I think so too well,

667
00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:15.350
it's nice to have your
back. We should do this

668
00:34:15.350 --> 00:34:17.690
more often. Yeah, we should.
We should. And I'm happy

669
00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:20.150
to anytime you want, but
you know, if you don't

670
00:34:20.150 --> 00:34:22.760
want to go and do
interviews by yourself too, that's

671
00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:25.790
totally cool with me. I've
been enjoying the time off,

672
00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:29.090
but it's always good to
talk to you, Scott. Cool.

673
00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:31.280
Well, thanks a lot. And
this has been another episode

674
00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:34.100
of Hansel minutes. We'll see
you again next week. Bye

675
00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:34.310
bye.
