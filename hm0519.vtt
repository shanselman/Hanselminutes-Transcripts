a weekly discussion with web

9
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.690
developer and technologist Scott Hanselman.
This is Lawrence Ryan announcing your

10
00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.670
show number 519. In this
episode, Scott talks with electrical

11
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:10.650
engineer, Laura Hughes from arrow.com. Hi,
this is Scott Hanselman. This

12
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.410
is another episode of Hansel
minutes today. I'm talking with

13
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.740
Laura Hughes. She's an electrical engineer
and she works at arrow.

14
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.590
How are you doing great.
How are you, Scott? I

15
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.990
am having all sorts of
fun. It's marches for maker

16
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.480
makers right now, and I'm,
I'm actually running all over

17
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.060
the arrow.com website, looking for
gadgets. And you guys have

18
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.910
a bunch of stuff. Is
this a website for makers

19
00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.130
or is this a website
for people who are in

20
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.350
industrial design or what's going
on here? All of the

21
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.170
above, we definitely started as
more placing an order of

22
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.510
10,000 pieces. We used to
say, if you need a

23
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.820
million of something, you go
directly to the supplier. If

24
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.660
you need 10,000, you come
to us. But now we're

25
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.730
taking a big initiative to
make this more friendly to

26
00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.700
the Makerspace. So everything that's
coming into inventory is now

27
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.280
available in quantity of one.
You don't have to buy

28
00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.500
a hundred of anything anymore,
and we're trying to sign

29
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.390
with all kinds of people.
Like eight fruit just got

30
00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.910
added to our line card.
We have Arduinos all sorts

31
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.760
of maker stuff. Oh cool.
And I also noticed that

32
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.880
for March it's free shipping.
So anything that's a hundred

33
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.730
bucks or $99 or more.
And so if you decide

34
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.590
to load up, if you're
building a robot or something,

35
00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.190
you can say free March
and you get free shipping

36
00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.190
in the U S which
is pretty sweet. Absolutely. And

37
00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.080
definitely stay tuned this month.
We're going to be running

38
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.350
a couple other promotions as
well. Alright, very cool. So,

39
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.140
so you're a, an electrical
engineer. When did you have

40
00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.050
your first kind of led
moment where you, you, you

41
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.850
made something happen and you
knew it was for you?

42
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.690
So I was actually eight.
I was in third grade

43
00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.220
and we had just done
circuits course in, I guess

44
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.670
our little science unit of
elementary school. And I had

45
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.100
gotten pulled out for something.
And so when I came

46
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.010
in to take the test,
I failed it. So my

47
00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.290
dad is an electrical engineer.
So I went home with

48
00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:55.910
that and he's like, all
right, we gotta get this

49
00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.370
right. So he sat down
and we drew it on

50
00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.490
paper. We talked about how,
if a circuit is going

51
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.350
to turn on a light,
it has to complete itself.

52
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.450
And then he found me
some wire and an led

53
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.930
and a battery and sat
down and had me connect

54
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.970
it up. And that was
my led moment. And it

55
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.240
was like, Oh my God,
it's just a circle. If

56
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.340
I can make a circle,
I can make anything happen.

57
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.840
So that was my first
led moment. Honestly, some of

58
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.970
the bigger ones though happened
in the last couple of

59
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.060
years when I was in
the lighting design team for

60
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.030
arrow, I realized just how
much light you can get

61
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.610
out of some of the
new LEDs, right? We're talking

62
00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.730
about the chip on board
that have tens of thousands

63
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.790
of lumens. That's a whole
nother kind of light bulb

64
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.300
moment. This is forgive me.
I'm going to ask a

65
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.180
lot of ignorant questions because
my IE experience consists of

66
00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.570
making a clock during the
required E courses that I

67
00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.210
took to do software engineering.
So I took a different

68
00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:53.010
path and went down the
software engineering direction. Is there

69
00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.050
how much power loss is
there? You know, if you

70
00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.770
have like a, you know,
a 1.5 volt battery and

71
00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.010
you've got half a half
an amp and how much

72
00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.360
light can you get out
of there and how much,

73
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.550
how much is lost? You
know what I mean? Cause

74
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.380
there were, there's been lots
of different ways to light

75
00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.450
things up and it keeps,
are we in, are we

76
00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.820
bringing light from another dimension?
Cause some of these LEDs

77
00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:16.770
are so bright. They they're
almost impossible. Exactly. And so

78
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:21.420
it really depends when you're
dealing with the more modern

79
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.640
surface Mount designed to get
a whole lot of lumen

80
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.300
out packages. Typically you're looking
at a hundred lumens per

81
00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.000
watt and that is pretty
much the best you can

82
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.210
do. And that is without
any electrical losses or optical

83
00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.980
losses, anything like that. So,
and honestly, out of the

84
00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.310
chip, we usually say, you
can get about 70% of

85
00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.550
light out. You're still gonna
lose 30% to heat, which

86
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.710
is why you see led
systems with such giant heat

87
00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.500
sinks on them. Because incandescent
bulbs, you want to heat

88
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.260
that up in order to
keep producing more light. That's

89
00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.810
how they work, which makes
it really interesting when you're

90
00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.210
trying to retrofit like cans
in the ceiling and stuff

91
00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.090
because he does the enemy
of LEDs. So you have

92
00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.940
to somehow get that out
into the ceiling. Interesting. So

93
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:07.230
I thought ignorantly that LED's
didn't really have much heat.

94
00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:09.090
Is it just that they
don't have much heat compared

95
00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:13.530
to other light sources like
incandescent and fluorescent? Absolutely. That

96
00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.710
so incandescent you're looking at
five to 10% efficient, you're

97
00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.520
getting 10% at best light
to 90% heat, which is

98
00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.170
why they get so hot.
If you've ever tried to

99
00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:24.690
change a light bulb too
quickly after turning it up.

100
00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.930
So Ellie incandescent light bulbs
are just little heaters. They're

101
00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.550
not really much light as
a secondary. Yes, absolutely. So

102
00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.310
the fact that an led
is even 70% efficient is

103
00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.420
a huge deal. Oh wow.
Seven. Okay. So 70% of

104
00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.250
your, so there is a
little bit of heat, but

105
00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.710
they can be used. Like
I know when I got

106
00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.740
some CFLs, you know, the
complex fluorescents, there's always a

107
00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.870
warning that says don't put
it in a can, don't

108
00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.980
put it in a compact,
in a enclosed space. I

109
00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:56.160
can do that with an
led though. It's still not

110
00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.720
great for it, but it
is still easier to use

111
00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.330
that way than a CFL
just because the CFL see

112
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.120
it's 40% efficient, it's going
to be generating a lot

113
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.900
more heat than even an
led bulb. So, and it

114
00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.660
seems like it's so fast
that LEDs took over the

115
00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:13.090
world. Like it seems like
just a couple of months

116
00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:15.820
ago, I finally converted all
of my old incandescent bulbs

117
00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.430
to CFLs. And now everyone's
saying I need to switch

118
00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:22.180
over to LEDs because CFLs
aren't good for the environment.

119
00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.510
That is true. I know.
Yeah. They really did kind

120
00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:28.540
of come out of nowhere.
It's a huge blossoming industry

121
00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.240
and there's so many applications
for it. Right? You can

122
00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.060
do so many different things
from even street lighting. It's

123
00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:37.510
easier to control them. They
have no downtime. So in

124
00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:40.900
stadiums, right? That's a big
one because you can immediately

125
00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.810
turn them on. If the
power goes out with the

126
00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:45.940
halogen bulbs, you actually have
to wait several minutes for

127
00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.520
them to come back up
And you can dim an

128
00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:54.520
led. Is that allowed? So
that gets interesting. You can

129
00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.740
absolutely dim them, but it's
harder to do than with

130
00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:00.280
an incandescent bulb with incandescent.
You just reduce the power

131
00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.580
into it with an led
your PWM in the input.

132
00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:06.340
So if you tried to
do that, yes, sorry. Pulse,

133
00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:10.450
which well pulse with modulation,
you're turning it on and

134
00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:13.690
off very quickly. And the
amount in a cycle that

135
00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:16.840
you have it on dictates
how bright it is. So

136
00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.360
if you say you have
a 90% duty cycle, it's

137
00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.790
on 90% of the time
and off 10% of the

138
00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:24.940
time and it's going to
be about 90% of its

139
00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:29.650
maximum brightness. So Deming is
a lie. We're flashing it.

140
00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:35.830
You're flashing. I know that's
crazy, which is why you'll

141
00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:38.800
see people like movie producers
refuse to go to led

142
00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.830
because it's possible. You can
get a refresh rate that

143
00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:45.400
somehow synchronizes with your camera
rate. So you can actually

144
00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.740
get flicker with LEDs because
they are, they are turning

145
00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:49.930
on and off really quickly.
Oh. And that's why when

146
00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:52.330
I take a picture of
my screen with my digital

147
00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:55.000
cameras, sometimes I can see
waves going over it because

148
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.180
there there's the refresh rate
of the camera on my

149
00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:00.100
phone and the refresh rate
of the, of the screen.

150
00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:05.470
Exactly Interesting. You know, there's
so much fun stuff like

151
00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:09.640
this that you learn. Like
you're teaching me things here

152
00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:12.340
and I'm 40 plus years
old and I'm going, you

153
00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:14.500
just filled in a gap.
You know what I mean?

154
00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:18.280
Like a Tetris piece of
knowledge just dropped down and

155
00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:21.280
snapped into place. And then
a bunch of things get

156
00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:23.740
explained. One of the fun
things I like to do

157
00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:26.980
when I do science classes
for kids is a, you

158
00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:29.860
show them a remote control
with an IRR. Can you

159
00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:32.440
see it? You can't see
it, But then you pointed

160
00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:35.140
at a, at a digital
camera or any kind of

161
00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:37.540
video camera and then they
can actually see the light.

162
00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:41.170
And, and when they learn
that like a remote control

163
00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:50.110
is just a fancy flashlight,
That's very, very true. All

164
00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:52.210
right. Well, these, my brain
exploded. I find that to

165
00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:54.760
be so interesting, like the
idea that all we're doing,

166
00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.000
like, like you could sit
there with a switch and

167
00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.770
just turn it on and
off really fast and change

168
00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:01.050
the channel if you were,
you know, if you could

169
00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:02.640
do that 60 times a
second, and that would be

170
00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:06.630
really awesome. Do you go
and teach it at any

171
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:08.370
kind of schools or do
any kind of like STEM

172
00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:11.520
education things when you either
by yourself or on behalf

173
00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:15.140
of, Well, right now we're
actually helping out a little

174
00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:20.000
bit with a high school
girls engineering club and they

175
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.610
are participating in the shell
car competition. So I actually

176
00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:28.190
just started talking with them.
They just finished their carbon

177
00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:31.070
fiber shell and they're ready
to get started on the

178
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:35.630
motor system. So that's going
to be really interesting. And

179
00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:40.040
then we're doing steam Fest,
which is STEM with arts

180
00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:43.730
in it. And then we're
also doing maker fair in

181
00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:51.950
may. Wow. That's fantastic. And
do you, when, when you

182
00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:53.990
see a new person, like
the people who are listening

183
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:55.910
to the show and thinking
about like marches for makers

184
00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:58.910
and they show up to
a, a website like ADA

185
00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:01.250
fruit or like arrow.com and
they see a bunch of

186
00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:04.130
things like here, I just
decided to show up and

187
00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:08.930
I see DM 32 zero
zero zero three. But I

188
00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:11.150
see USB starter kit. I'm
like, I look like this

189
00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:13.070
looks like some kind of
chip that does some kind

190
00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:16.130
of thing. And it says
starter kit, but I still

191
00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:19.820
have no idea what it
does. Sometimes the onboarding can

192
00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:22.610
be a little bit overwhelming.
How do I, how do

193
00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:24.260
I get involved if I
don't know what all of

194
00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.470
these three letter acronyms are?
So one of the best

195
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:30.560
kept secrets is that none
of us actually know most

196
00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.810
of what's on our website.
Right. And that's how it

197
00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:35.420
comes from being a part
of a distributor like this.

198
00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:39.620
None of us quite know.
So honestly you just learn

199
00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:43.010
how to learn, right? We
have a lot of resources

200
00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:46.160
to help you. We've got
the engineers that can live

201
00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.980
chat with you right away.
We've got 180 or something

202
00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:51.980
that you can email and
ask questions to them. But

203
00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:54.620
we do try to make
sure every data sheet is

204
00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:57.410
online and we actually have
data sheets for everything even

205
00:10:57.410 --> 00:10:59.750
that we don't sell. So
that's a good place to

206
00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:01.610
start, even if you have
a starter kit from somewhere

207
00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:04.160
else, but right. If you
want it to open up

208
00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.650
the starter kit, you can
check out the data sheet.

209
00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:09.620
We have a lot of
reference designs that may already

210
00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:11.210
be using that. So it
can help you get up

211
00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:14.780
and running with that pretty
quickly. Yeah. I'm learning about

212
00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:17.810
data sheets. They're obvious, of
course, if people are electrical

213
00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:20.600
engineers, but when you're just
kind of getting started making

214
00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:25.130
they're a little bit overwhelming,
but mostly I've been focusing

215
00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:28.130
on, you know, pin outs
and voltage. So for example,

216
00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:31.250
I'm trying to work with
a little tool. It, what

217
00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:33.620
is this thing called reaching
over in my desk here?

218
00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:37.460
Some kind of a deal
that's a, a gyroscope, right?

219
00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:39.440
And the data sheet, the
data I want, I want

220
00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.480
to do a thing where
I can it'll tell when

221
00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:44.120
my garage door opens, I've
been, this is my kind

222
00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.580
of go to project. So
I make it multiple times

223
00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:48.230
in multiple ways to see
if I can learn more

224
00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:50.510
and more. So you tape
it to the garage, the

225
00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:54.640
garage door opens. And then
that is a difference in

226
00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:59.320
orientation. The gyro, the, the
gyroscope here has this amazingly

227
00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:02.470
complicated data sheet, but it's
only got like six, like

228
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:04.570
five or six pins on
it. So I'm trying to

229
00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:06.550
see if I can get
away with just using one

230
00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:09.750
or two pages of the,
of the data sheet, R

231
00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:11.920
R is reading this kind
of stuff. Something that you

232
00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:14.800
learn in engineering school, or
is this something that people

233
00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.880
can pick up? It is
not something we covered in

234
00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.280
school. And I think it
would have been great if

235
00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:22.440
we did, but it is
something you just learn. What

236
00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:25.590
is important for every product
family. Right? The first thing

237
00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:28.800
we always go to is
the absolute maximum ratings. Usually

238
00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:31.920
that's a nice little chart
in there somewhere, and that's

239
00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:33.540
just always great to keep
in the back of your

240
00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:36.600
mind, right? Because even with
LEDs, if you're doing something

241
00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:38.700
and you happen to give
it a little bit too

242
00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:41.880
much, current, too much voltage,
and it dies on you,

243
00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:44.220
it's good to know why
or prevent that in the

244
00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:47.220
first place. So honestly, usually
that, and like you said,

245
00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:50.100
the pin out that tends
to be what you need

246
00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:52.680
to know more and more.
I'm seeing data sheets give

247
00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:55.410
you a typical application circuit,
which is so helpful because

248
00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:57.540
it shows you where to
put all the little capacitors

249
00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:01.290
and resistors that the chip
needs to work. But you

250
00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:03.000
just don't know that off
the top of your head.

251
00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:06.570
So that's always very handy
Need to know about it.

252
00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:08.700
I didn't realize that I
would be more likely to

253
00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:10.800
use something that had a
data sheet that said, and

254
00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.750
here's a typical way that
you would wire this up

255
00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:17.790
with other things. Typical application
would be extreme. Absolutely. I

256
00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:19.920
was just in power supply
design. That was something we

257
00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:21.750
did all the time because
you have all these different

258
00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:24.330
chips that seem to do
about the same thing. So

259
00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:26.790
it really gets to the
chips and suppliers advantage. If

260
00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:29.760
you have multiple application circuits
in there to say, here's

261
00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:33.120
how you do 50 Watts,
200 Watts of kilowatt and

262
00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:38.100
help you out with the
part selection there. Hey folks,

263
00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:39.930
I wanted to take a
moment to tell you about

264
00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.560
Reagan and their new product
called pulse Reagan as an

265
00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:46.920
error and crash reporting software
provider and their new product

266
00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:50.520
pulse. It's a realtime user
monitoring product. It gives you

267
00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:54.330
performance data and user insights.
Lets you understand exactly what's

268
00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:57.330
happening when users interact with
your software. So you're never

269
00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:00.660
left guessing. Reagan provides you
with the answers to your

270
00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:04.800
performance questions and they've found
over 10 billion that's billion with

271
00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:08.130
a B bugs and customer
apps with their crash reporting

272
00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:12.120
product. And now Reagan will
help you understand application quality.

273

Reagan for free today@reagan.io, I

278
00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:35.550
was working on a project
with my nephew and we

279
00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:38.400
mostly have the LEDs that
have the long leg and

280
00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:41.520
the short leg. And then
he saw a thing here

281
00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:44.490
on the site called a
light and optical light pipe.

282
00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:50.250
Are you familiar with this?
I am. So there's a

283
00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:52.280
couple of different things. Ended
up called a light pipe,

284
00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:55.820
but really what it is
is I'm just a fiber

285
00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:57.470
optic. And it's funny you
bring this up because we

286
00:14:57.470 --> 00:14:59.630
actually did this in one
of our lunch and learns

287
00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:04.250
in our lab at arrow.
We made little lightsabers that

288
00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:08.090
were essentially light pipes. We
took acrylic tubing sanded up

289
00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:09.950
the edges so that the
light would diffuse out of

290
00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:12.320
it. And then gluten led
to the end. And it

291
00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:15.350
did exactly that. If you
looked at it before you

292
00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:17.810
sanded it up, you would
see the light right through

293
00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:19.460
the end, but it wouldn't
come out the sides at

294
00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:22.310
all. So a light pipe
is really just a diffuse

295
00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:25.280
acrylic tube, but they have
special ways of making them

296
00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:27.050
so you can get them
that are bendy. I've seen

297
00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:31.370
them as balloon strings, which
is pretty crazy. They're very,

298
00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:33.560
very fun. They're a little
bit like ELL wire if

299
00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:37.420
you've ever seen that. And
how is that different from

300
00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:42.610
fiber optic? It's rough on
the edges When you see

301
00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:44.710
those little like kind of
like a, it's like a,

302
00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:47.470
like a group of, is
it Ealy or where is

303
00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:49.150
it? That's a group of
flowers, almost like a bunch

304
00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:51.490
of flowers where the tips
are all lit up. Is

305
00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:54.220
that fiber optics or is
that That's fiber optic. And

306
00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:56.260
you can usually tell the
difference because you can only

307
00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:59.200
see the light at the
very end. You don't see

308
00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:01.180
the light admitting all the
way through the tube ESL

309
00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:04.120
or ELL wire, but also
the light pipes are pretty

310
00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:07.870
good about dispersing all the
way through. Typically those are

311
00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:11.200
actually what you use when
you're making a box and

312
00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:13.570
have a circuit board with
some surface Mount LEDs on

313
00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:15.820
it. And then you need
to get that light up

314
00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:17.620
to the top of your
surface. So those are just

315
00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:21.160
little short tubes that operate
a lot like giant fiber

316
00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:23.620
optics. They don't want to
disperse the light through it,

317
00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:25.780
but that's how you use
it in the real world.

318
00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:28.570
But light pipes are really
fun if you scratch them

319
00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:31.240
up because then you can
make lightsabers. You had me

320
00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:35.440
at lightsabers. Yeah. I've been
finding, messing with all the

321
00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:37.900
different things that are available
to make light. Like, you

322
00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:40.660
know, you initially start out,
you make that led blink

323
00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:43.120
and then you learn that,
you know, ELL wire or

324
00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:46.720
electroluminescent wire exists. And then
that becomes something exciting that

325
00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:49.030
you can do. And now,
now that you're telling me

326
00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:50.740
that I can scratch up
a light pipe and make

327
00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:54.430
it light saber, that's pretty
awesome. What about these led

328
00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:59.530
strips? You can buy them
on. Absolutely. So we actually

329
00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:01.600
just used a bunch of
those in our cornhole video,

330
00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:05.560
if anybody's seen that and
the big strip was just

331
00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:07.720
plugged into a battery, but
one of the smaller ones,

332
00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:09.520
even though it's 12 volt,
we were able to control

333
00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:12.400
it with an Arduino. We
just used a little and

334
00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:19.060
two, two and 2222, which
is a simple BJT. You

335
00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:28.020
can use a bipolar, Oh
gosh, junction transistor quiz. And

336
00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:30.100
all it does is operate
as a little switch. So

337
00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:34.870
it can make, I describe
it as the actual brain,

338
00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:38.050
your arm will independently move.
It needs a brain to

339
00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:40.630
send a tiny little signal
to it in order to

340
00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:43.180
move the large thing that
is your arm. So that's

341
00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:44.950
what the Arduino can do.
It can send a little

342
00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:48.850
signal to this gate and
the switch will open or,

343
00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:51.870
and allow power to flow
through. So that's how we

344
00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:55.110
made it flash. We had
the Arduino say, okay, turn

345
00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:58.170
this pin on and off
five times. And because we

346
00:17:58.170 --> 00:18:01.500
had that going to the
gate of the transistor, when

347
00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:04.140
that went high, the switch
closed, and we were able

348
00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:06.480
to connect the 12 volts
to a 12 volt source.

349
00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:08.640
So it actually was able
to be controlled through an

350
00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:12.290
Arduino, which is pretty neat.
Now these, these long strips

351
00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:15.020
of LEDs I've used them
in costumes and stuff, but

352
00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:16.820
is it true that there
are ones where you can

353
00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:21.500
individually address an led within
the longer strip? Absolutely. Those

354
00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:23.270
are the eight of fruit,
Neo pixels, and we just

355
00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:25.310
started carrying them. I'm really
excited to actually have a

356
00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:26.630
roll on my desk right
now that I'm going to

357
00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:30.230
go play with after this.
And it's really, truly brilliant

358
00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:32.900
how they did it. Each
chip has its own little

359
00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:36.320
brain to it. So it
only takes, I think, six

360
00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:38.780
control lines for the entire
strip and you can make

361
00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:41.480
any single led do any
kind of effect. So you

362
00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:45.590
can do kind of color
chasing, changing. I'm sure you

363
00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:49.310
could. I will do any
kind of effect. Does that

364
00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:51.590
mean a control line, six
control lines? Cause you sound

365
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:53.570
impressed by that and I
want to be impressed also.

366
00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:58.250
Yeah. So typically when you
have a single RGB red,

367
00:18:58.250 --> 00:19:01.400
green, blue led in one
package, you have three lines,

368
00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:03.950
well, four lines, you have
a ground and then you

369
00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:05.930
have one that you can
use to control how much

370
00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:09.290
red, how much green and
how much blue A light

371
00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:12.380
bulb just went on. Like
no pun intended. So four

372
00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:15.470
wires ground and then red,
green, blue, and then zero

373
00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:18.830
to two 55 effectively. Exactly.
So that's, if you have

374
00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:21.890
a single RGB, led light
comes in in Arduino kit,

375
00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:24.890
that's usually how you control
it. Okay. So then you

376
00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:27.770
think about, if you wanted
to control a role of

377
00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:32.450
however many are on their
a hundred LEDs, you kind

378
00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:34.550
of think, Oh gosh, am
I going to have a

379
00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:38.300
hundred reds, a hundred greens,
a hundred blues, but no,

380
00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:41.480
the way that they did
it, it's very clever. You

381
00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:45.830
give each one of them
an address. And basically from

382
00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:48.620
the Arduino, you're just kind
of shouting down the line

383
00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:53.060
and say, Hey, O X,
a F F do this.

384
00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:55.940
And you kind of get
the LEDs to play telephone.

385
00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:58.580
Like if the first one
is not a FF, it's

386
00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:00.830
like, I dunno, I'm going
to keep passing this message

387
00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:02.990
down. And then when it
gets to the right led,

388
00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:05.780
it does. Okay. So they
are it's, it is, it

389
00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:09.470
is message passing it's duck,
duck goose led style. That's

390
00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:12.320
exactly what it is. Okay.
So if it's for me,

391
00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:14.360
I keep it. And otherwise
I pass it along to

392
00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:17.270
the next person. Exactly. And
it's just a very clever

393
00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:18.950
way to do it because
yeah. If you think about

394
00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:22.040
all those anodes and cathodes
trying to control them, that

395
00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:24.920
gets really ugly really quickly.
Yeah. So then they've got,

396
00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:28.310
you said six lines then.
So let me that's ground

397
00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:31.040
and then three for the
color. And then two that

398
00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:34.670
represent the address that can
be passed down. Probably I

399
00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:37.010
can't, I'm not actually sure
how these work. I haven't

400
00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:39.080
plugged them in yet. They
probably go off the spy

401
00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:41.390
line. So one is probably
data and one is probably

402
00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:45.200
clock and that just helps
keep it all synchronized so

403
00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:49.000
that you're not sending things
asynchronously. And then The result

404
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.740
of all of this is
that the one in the

405
00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:52.360
first one in the line
is still going to come

406
00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:53.710
on at the same speed
as the one at the

407
00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:56.910
end of the line, for
all intent, For all intents

408
00:20:56.910 --> 00:21:02.280
and purposes. Exactly. I bet
if you put a scope

409
00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:04.290
pro-bono you would see them
turn on at different times,

410
00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:07.110
but our eyes have no
idea. It moves so fast

411
00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:10.290
Becoming like really cheap. Like
I've seen that like, you

412
00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:12.930
know, 10, 15 years ago,
if someone had custom led

413
00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:15.570
lighting in their, you know,
their quote unquote home theater

414
00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:18.030
room, you'd say that's a
pretty fancy person with a

415
00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:20.640
lot of money, but now
you can buy these pretty

416
00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:24.030
inexpensively. And I've seen people
put in mood lighting that

417
00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:26.130
changes with the color of
what's going on on the

418
00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:30.780
screen. Or like, remember that
Phillips the light, the ambient

419
00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:33.950
light. It was a, a
way of having incredible hulks

420
00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:36.060
on the screen. Then you've
got green coming outside. The

421
00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:39.300
imagine if your whole room
did that, Oh, that would

422
00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:41.370
be so fun. And all
you need is a color

423
00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:43.530
sensor. Can you get on
that and make that happen

424
00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:45.480
for us to make that
happen? I'm going to write

425
00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:48.780
that down. You watch the
video. I would tell everyone

426
00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:51.000
about it. I would make
it. I want it. Basically

427
00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.220
what I want is like,
if, if the hulks towards

428
00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:55.850
the top of the screen,
you know, and that's, so

429
00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:58.530
the top of the screen
is predominantly green. Then the

430
00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:01.080
whole whole room gets screened
and that it's got a

431
00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:03.180
fade in. Right? So as
the colors are changing, the

432
00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:05.880
whole, room's got to change
a color. Oh my goodness.

433
00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:07.500
I want to watch the
Avengers right now with my

434
00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:12.090
living room posting in color,
huh? Yes. Yes. Oh my

435
00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:16.080
gosh. The Phillips know there's
the Phillips hue, which is

436
00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:18.450
like a smart light bulb
has some basic things, but

437
00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:20.040
they make it too complicated.
I think we can do

438
00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:23.520
this ourselves without the internet.
Oh we can. Oh my

439
00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:25.770
goodness. We could make this
IOT connected. Oh, this could

440
00:22:25.770 --> 00:22:27.730
be fun. Okay. This is
a Missy. Now we've got

441
00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:30.170
to, we've got a project
now for March and we're,

442
00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:32.130
we're only halfway through March.
So this is, this is

443
00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:35.160
fantastic. This is fantastic. When
does the next Avengers come

444
00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:37.830
out? We can definitely have
it done by then. We'll

445
00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:40.470
aim. Yeah. We'll aim for
captain America, civil war. And

446
00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:46.440
that'll be awesome. Okay. That's
true. But any anyway, but

447
00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:49.020
it's amazing what you can
do with just an Arduino,

448
00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:51.000
right? You can get the
color sensor. We have those

449
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.840
everywhere. Put them somewhere. You
can control all the, I

450
00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:56.550
mean, even if you didn't
want to do them individually,

451
00:22:56.550 --> 00:23:00.630
addressable, you can control the
color of even those really

452
00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:04.650
cheap strip lights. You get
off Amazon for nothing. You

453
00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:06.690
can control all those. And
they are pretty bright. I

454
00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:08.730
use them as under lighting.
I actually had them in

455
00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:12.480
the shower because, Hey, who
wouldn't want multicolored waterproof lights

456
00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:14.370
Or they can be done
water for, that was my

457
00:23:14.370 --> 00:23:16.650
first question. Like your first,
my thinking, you have a

458
00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:19.140
death, which you have a
death. Wish you have LEDs

459
00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:22.110
in your butt and your
shower. But ultimately there are

460
00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:23.580
things like that. You would
keep the power, you keep

461
00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:26.250
the wires outside the shower
and then the strip enters

462
00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:28.950
the shower. And it's waterproof
from that point. Yes. That

463
00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:30.540
is something to be very
careful of. Don't try to

464
00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:33.690
plug live wires into the
shower, please. That is, that

465
00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:37.830
is how you die. Interesting.
So that brings me up

466
00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:40.020
to an interesting question. So
you, you, you, there's one

467
00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:42.360
project you have in your
house. Are you doing that?

468
00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:45.980
Are you thinking about ways
you can integrate electronics into

469
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:48.140
making your life easier? What
other projects around the house

470
00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:52.840
if you've done? Oh, absolutely.
It's it kind of becomes

471
00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:54.790
an obsession. Doesn't it? As
soon as you realize, Oh,

472
00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:56.890
I could do something about
that. You you've had to

473
00:23:56.890 --> 00:23:58.390
figure out how to do
it. Even if the project

474
00:23:58.390 --> 00:24:01.270
is probably more expensive than
just buying the solution, but

475
00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:05.410
most of mine are lighting
related. I absolutely love lighting.

476
00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:10.120
So I have adjustable strips
everywhere in the house, a

477
00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:13.360
couple motorized things. We're actually
going to do a quick

478
00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:16.840
video coming up around PI
day, how to make a,

479
00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:20.380
an Apple pie with a
power supply. So a lot

480
00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:24.610
of use of motors and
stuff like that. And honestly,

481
00:24:24.610 --> 00:24:27.100
just taking things apart and
making them a little bit

482
00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:29.620
easier to use. I've definitely
ripped apart things like an

483
00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:31.810
alarm clock and put a
capacitive sensor on it and

484
00:24:31.810 --> 00:24:33.700
stuff. So when you hit
it, you don't have to

485
00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:35.950
actually hit the button to
make it stop making that

486
00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:41.860
horrible noise. You just hit
the foil, right. Retrofit something.

487
00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:46.150
Cause ultimately you're trying to
slap the snooze button. Right.

488
00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:48.850
But ultimately if you just
slept the thing itself and

489
00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:50.620
it could feel that you
hit it, then that would

490
00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:54.850
activate the snooze button. That's
a really great thing for

491
00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:58.570
people who are listening, right.
Making and, and celebrating marches

492
00:24:58.570 --> 00:25:00.790
for makers doesn't necessarily have
to be building something from

493
00:25:00.790 --> 00:25:03.610
scratch. It can be changing
the behavior, something you already

494
00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:07.300
have, Right? Because obviously so
many good ideas are already

495
00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:09.790
out there, but it's so
satisfying to take something apart

496
00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:11.380
and say, this is what
I really wish it could

497
00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:14.740
do. And now it does
that because these changes don't

498
00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:16.900
have to be big. They
can be adding lights or

499
00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:20.650
speakers or changing the way
a button moves. That's really

500
00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:22.390
the easiest way to get
into it. Right? Take apart

501
00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:25.240
what you already have. Now
you mentioned something about color

502
00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:28.930
sensors. Are those are those
big things or small things?

503
00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:31.150
What's the size of that?
Cause my, my son and

504
00:25:31.150 --> 00:25:35.170
I just put together a,
a Lego Rubik's cube solver

505
00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:37.540
and it has a little
color sensor and it looks

506
00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:39.400
at each square on the
Rubik's cube and has to

507
00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:42.700
scan it before, before it
does it, is that like

508
00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:45.880
an led in reverse? That
is exactly what it is.

509
00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:49.810
Yep. So a regular RGB
led has three little strips

510
00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:52.750
that emit red, green and
blue. The sensor just has

511
00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:56.320
photo sensitive strips for the
same colors. And wouldn't, it

512
00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:59.170
need to have some kind
of illumination, like a white

513
00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:02.380
elimination led to make it
really clear, like a white

514
00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:05.410
balance. Almost like there's different.
Look as ambient light, I

515
00:26:05.410 --> 00:26:06.940
would think would make it.
So you couldn't tell what

516
00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:09.910
color something was. It does
make a big difference. So

517
00:26:09.910 --> 00:26:12.910
the cheaper ones don't have
that kind of balancing and

518
00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:15.430
they work the way you
would assume based on that,

519
00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:18.220
the really good ones. Yes.
They do have a separate

520
00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:20.860
white led and they know
exactly what kind of weight

521
00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:23.950
it is because ultimately with
LEDs, you can only emit

522
00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:26.920
so many wavelengths, right? So
it's usually a blue led,

523
00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:29.260
that's coated in a foster
that makes it look white.

524
00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:31.840
So if they know the
properties of that phosphor, they

525
00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:34.360
can know exactly what wavelengths
they're putting out. So they

526
00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:37.900
know exactly how to interpret
what's coming back. Okay. Interesting.

527
00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:40.870
And I'm also learning as
I'm, as we're talking, I'm

528
00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:43.830
learning about this. I see
that there's color sensors on

529
00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:47.880
the site that also are
smart about IRR. Apparently ambient

530
00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:51.030
infrared light that's around can
throw these things off. So

531
00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:53.310
if you're in an environment
where you're trying to sense

532
00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:57.530
color and someone's got remote
controls or, Or you're outside,

533
00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:00.380
Gosh, they forget about that
because isn't that, that is

534
00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:02.630
the outside. Isn't it? It's
just one big, giant infrared

535
00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:07.910
thing. That's exactly where that
comes into play. Interesting. So

536
00:27:07.910 --> 00:27:10.220
that's a huge problem then
like the sunlight messes with

537
00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:14.060
these things, Sunlight is wreaks
havoc on sensors. It's pretty

538
00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:16.100
funny. It, you would think
it would help to have

539
00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:19.160
that much light around, but
it, it really, really confuses

540
00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:23.090
things from IRS sensors to
color sensors, to even trying

541
00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:26.510
to do beam, brake sensors.
No. When you're plugging in

542
00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:29.120
your LEDs and your different
projects, you've mentioned Arduino a

543
00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:32.150
couple of times, and we've
been doing some projects this

544
00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:36.260
month with Arduinos. Do you
need, like you just plug

545
00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:38.990
the LEDs directly into the
Arduino or do you use

546
00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:41.900
a, is it called a
relay to control that? Or

547
00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:43.910
what's the way that you
manage the power requirements of

548
00:27:43.910 --> 00:27:46.070
the led versus what the
Arduino is able to put

549
00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:49.820
out? Sure. So the fact
that the Arduino has limited

550
00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:52.820
current outputs actually makes it
really nice because it's really

551
00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:56.300
hard to explode your LEDs
because even though they have

552
00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:59.750
a 3.3 volt output and
your led probably wants less

553
00:27:59.750 --> 00:28:01.520
voltage than that, you would
normally need to use a

554
00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:04.820
resistor and you probably still
should. But if you do

555
00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:08.240
plug it directly between a
digital pen and ground on

556
00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:10.190
the Adreno, it's not going
to blow up. It'll just

557
00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:13.460
only give it so many
milliamps. That is not true.

558
00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:16.790
If you're using a power
source that you plug into

559
00:28:16.790 --> 00:28:18.920
the wall. So if you
have like a five volt

560
00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:21.050
power supply, you definitely want
to make sure to put

561
00:28:21.050 --> 00:28:24.050
the correct resistors in there,
but yeah, you can turn

562
00:28:24.050 --> 00:28:25.790
it on and off with
a relay. You can use

563
00:28:25.790 --> 00:28:27.950
a BJT like we talked
about that's the cheap and

564
00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:30.830
easy way to do it.
If you were doing anything

565
00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:34.370
really big or AC, you
would need to use a

566
00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:37.520
relay. Definitely. Now one of
the things that people who've

567
00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:39.680
told me, who've got, it
started with things like Arduinos

568
00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:42.080
is like, well, it works
really great when it's plugged

569
00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:45.080
into my computer, but I
don't have a power strategy

570
00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:48.380
for it. Outside of my
computer. I've seen people use

571
00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:52.130
nine volt batteries. I've seen
people try to buy, you

572
00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:55.430
know, plug in wall things.
But I understand that the

573
00:28:55.430 --> 00:29:00.380
word is lipo, lithium poly
batteries is that right? And

574
00:29:00.410 --> 00:29:03.140
these little, these little batteries
are like, they're, they're like,

575
00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:06.920
you know, smaller than your
Palm, quite small. How long

576
00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:09.050
can these run LEDs? Are
these something I could run

577
00:29:09.050 --> 00:29:10.520
for weeks? Or are we
just talking about a day

578
00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:13.820
or so? We're definitely talking
about weeks. It depends on

579
00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:17.660
the LEDs. If you're just
running one little one. Absolutely.

580
00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:20.450
And that's probably true for
a nine volt battery as

581
00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:22.190
well. Honestly, they do not
take a whole lot of

582
00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:24.800
current. If you're running the
Arduino with it, those can

583
00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:26.330
draw. I want to say
up to about a hundred

584
00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:29.060
milliamps. So it might take
a little bit longer, but

585
00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:32.600
those are very, very efficient.
The danger is that they

586
00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:38.180
also can be punctured and
start big fires. So even

587
00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:40.340
the little wins, which is
pretty unfortunate, that's why there's

588
00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:43.120
so many regulations and you
can't Ship them certain places.

589
00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:45.850
Can't bring them on airplanes.
And that's just because they're

590
00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:50.590
squishy. If you stab them,
they explode also true of

591
00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:57.610
humans. So weird. Interesting. So,
so something to think about

592
00:29:57.610 --> 00:30:00.340
if you're working with this
with kids and you're doing

593
00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:03.940
things with screwdrivers and soldering
irons and things that could

594
00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:07.390
either puncture heat up these
little packets, these very convenient

595
00:30:07.390 --> 00:30:12.910
sources of power, but definitely
volatile. Honestly, a nine volt

596
00:30:12.910 --> 00:30:15.160
battery might be an okay
place to start if it's

597
00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:18.400
a short term project. Okay.
That's super, that's super helpful.

598
00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:20.950
Gosh, well, I really appreciate
you chatting with me today.

599
00:30:21.550 --> 00:30:23.530
Thanks for having me. It's
been fun. We've got a

600
00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:25.720
new project to go try
that seriously. Like you make

601
00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:28.000
this happen and I'm going
to tell everyone that would

602
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.160
be amazing. Cause I'm looking
to buy a new TV

603
00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:33.580
and I would love to
have totally hell if I

604
00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:37.120
could get the entire house
pulsing with like led colors,

605
00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:39.760
you know, based on what's
on the screen. Oh my

606
00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:42.130
goodness. That would be a
super project. So yeah. I'm

607
00:30:42.130 --> 00:30:44.110
excited to hear what you
to see, what you, what

608
00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:48.160
you make with that. Definitely.
All right. This has been

609
00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:50.770
another episode of Hanselminutes and
we'll see you again next

610
00:30:50.770 --> 00:30:51.100
week.
