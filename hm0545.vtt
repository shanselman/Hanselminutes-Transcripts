2
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.520
developer and technologist Scott Hanselman.
This is Lawrence Ryan announcing show

3
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.620
number 545. In this episode,
Scott talks with noted humorous

4
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.240
blogger and philanthropist, lovey ajar
about her brand or tech

5
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.240
and her new book. And
sidled, I'm judging you the

6
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:43.410
do better manual. Hi, this
is Scott Hanselman. This is

7
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.320
another episode of Hansel minutes
today. We've got a really

8
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.980
special guest it's lovey Ajay.
How are you? I'm good.

9
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.290
Thank you for having me.
And you know, for folks

10
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.800
that may not have, have
heard or remembered that you

11
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.930
and I had a podcast,
we had a podcast for

12
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.100
like about two years. It
was called ratchet and the

13
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.050
geek and go listen to
it. If it makes you

14
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.950
happy. And we talked about
TV shows and pop culture

15
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.960
and all the kind of
exciting stuff that we share.

16
00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.760
I think we ended up
doing 17 episodes and then

17
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.420
it went away and it
went away for a really

18
00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.820
good reason. I was really
sad because we were having

19
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.160
a lot of fun, but
then you started to write,

20
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.830
Oh man, my life basically
took off and I stopped

21
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.810
having time. And I never
knew where I was going

22
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.940
to be on any given
day. And traveling with the

23
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.100
equipment was not going to
be possible for me. Yeah.

24
00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.930
Yeah, absolutely. You started to
write and how long did

25
00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.790
it take you? You just,
you wrote a book and

26
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.950
it's coming out September 13th. When
did you write this book?

27
00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.360
Did you write it on
the road? Was this a

28
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.180
book that was written in
airports? Yeah. So my book

29
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.730
is called, I'm judging you
the do better manual. And

30
00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.200
I wrote it last year
was traveling to six countries,

31
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.790
four continents across five months,
Man. I thought too, this

32
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.950
is the thing I thought
I did the most. That's

33
00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.960
why I'm excited. That's why
I'm excited to have you

34
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.500
on the show. Because when
we met like years ago,

35
00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.580
I was like the OGE
blogger and we would compare

36
00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.480
traffic. And then I would
watch you make these amazing

37
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.530
moves and you would improve
your writing. You'd improve your

38
00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.650
blog. We would change our
templates. You know, I would

39
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.210
change my template. I'd show
you like, look at my

40
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.280
blog template. It looks so
much better. And then you

41
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.960
would show me yours like,
Oh, it looks even better.

42
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.890
And now you've lapped me
completely. Your traffic is your

43
00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.310
blog. Traffic is completely off
the charts. I mean, million

44
00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.950
people, a million people a
month or more are reading

45
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.730
your blog. It's amazing. I
am so happy for you.

46
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.800
And so excited that people
are gonna be able to

47
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.440
read your book. I'm excited
too, because I've been blogging

48
00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.340
for 13 years. So, you
know, it's people were like,

49
00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.630
what made you write a
book? I'm like, it was

50
00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.370
the next step. It was
the, the organic next step.

51
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.770
I can't, I want to
put people to hold onto

52
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.710
something besides something they can
click on online. Yeah. There's

53
00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.050
a physicality to it. I
think you, I knowing you

54
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.780
walking around airports, I bet
you sat in an airport

55
00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.850
bookstore and you said I'm
going to be in the

56
00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.130
front of the bookstore on
that show. Oh yeah. Every

57
00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.020
time I walked by one
of those Hudson news or

58
00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.440
Barbara bookstores now I'm like,
I cannot wait until the

59
00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.330
first time I walked past
them. My book is sitting

60
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.220
in the window. That is
going to be a cool

61
00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.610
moment. Has that happened yet?
That's not gonna happen. Like

62
00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.120
I said, it hasn't happened
yet because the book comes

63
00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.970
out on the 13th, but
I've got a physical copy

64
00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.680
right here and it smells
really good. It smells like

65
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.170
a book. Yes. So that's
a really great point that

66
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.170
you made though. You have
been blogging for 13 years.

67
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.880
And I think when people
see what they perceive as

68
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:53.370
overnight success, they don't realize
overnight success takes decades. Exactly.

69
00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.340
I called myself a 13
year overnight success because people

70
00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.260
will see what I've done.
And they're like, Oh my

71
00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.990
gosh, you just came out
of nowhere. I'm like, no,

72
00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.930
there were many years when
I wasn't getting anything. And

73
00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.890
I was wondering if I
was just banging my head

74
00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.930
against an invisible wall. So
I think it comes down

75
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.100
to people really understanding that
there are no overnight successes

76
00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.770
Too. Do you think that
when people, like I talked

77
00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:23.670
to people about blogging and
they ask me like, how

78
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.440
you do it, that I'm
sure you get the same

79
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.060
thing. You know, you get
fans, you get people who

80
00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.390
are excited and you tell
them, well, start blogging for

81
00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:34.710
a year or two and
expect no viewers like blog

82
00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.630
for a year and no
one will read it. And

83
00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.300
they always laugh. Like, but
you're like, no, that's really

84
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.860
the advice I'm giving you.
Like you're going to blog

85
00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.960
for a year and no
one's going to care. Yeah.

86
00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.780
I mean, I think people
now they come out the

87
00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.860
gate being like, Oh, I'm
going to blog. And I'm

88
00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.020
going to make a lot
of money with it. And

89
00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.470
instead of them perfecting their
content and ensuring that they're

90
00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.950
doing good work, they're so
obsessed on monetizing that they

91
00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:03.360
never get good work done.
I mean, we blogged for

92
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.200
free for a long time.
Long time. Like most of

93
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.910
them, like I've been blogging.
I don't know, like, what

94
00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.490
is it now? 15 years?
I would say the first

95
00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.150
12 before I got sponsors.
And, and even then the

96
00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:16.980
sponsors are not the kind
of sponsors where I'm going

97
00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.290
to, you know, as, as
we say, move out of

98
00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.330
my parents' house and get
my own place. Yeah. I

99
00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.000
mean, I think for, let
me see, I've been blogging

100
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.790
for 13 years and I
didn't start making money on

101
00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:32.430
it until like 2012. So
nine years of nothing. Exactly.

102
00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.500
But you did it for
the love, the love of

103
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:40.170
writing. And speaking of the
love, you've built this community.

104
00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:42.330
What is the name of
your company? My community is

105
00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:47.190
called love nation. L U
V. Loved him. The movies.

106
00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:51.870
L U V V nation.
Okay. Okay. And these are

107
00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:55.320
all like, they are almost
like you're, you're, you're an

108
00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.340
extra arm. Cause they're and
they write for you. They'll

109
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.910
you'll bring up a topic.
They'll talk about it. You'll

110
00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:03.650
ask them if you can
include some of their content

111
00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.770
on your blog. And it
is like that collaborative process

112
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.010
where you get to see
the humor from your community,

113
00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:12.760
come out in your blog
posts. That's so Yeah, my

114
00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.640
audience is fantastic. They named
themselves loved nation because they

115
00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:20.950
felt like they needed to
have a community name. So

116
00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:25.510
my audience is also really
attached to my voice and

117
00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:29.560
they actually consider themselves long
distance cousins because we've created

118
00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:33.040
this camaraderie and yeah, they
create a content for me

119
00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:36.070
because my audience, you know
how like on the internet,

120
00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.510
people say, don't read the
comments. It is the opposite

121
00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:43.420
for me on my blog
and on my social platforms,

122
00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:45.340
you want to read the
comments? Cause these are the

123
00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:51.100
funniest, most thoughtful, most hilarious
people on the internet. Do

124
00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:52.690
you? And you don't have
to, you, they, they self

125
00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:55.810
police. They, they push people
out of me. They definitely

126
00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:58.690
self police. Like I'll show
up and see one hateful

127
00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:02.980
comment that's already been handled.
And they're very protective of

128
00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:06.670
the environment of making sure
that we keep love nation

129
00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:09.910
and all my platforms as
a safe space for people

130
00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:12.670
to come laugh, to come
think, to come say things

131
00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:16.090
that are honest but not
hateful. So yeah, they absolutely

132
00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:19.870
defend it. So you say
all of your different platforms,

133
00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:22.720
how many places are you?
And it all comes together

134
00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:28.660
at awesomely, Lovie, Calm. I
am on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram

135
00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:33.070
on a lesser level. You
were early on in Pinterest.

136
00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:35.080
You did some fairly innovative
stuff in here. I'm on

137
00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.210
Pinterest still. So I do
still use Pinterest a little

138
00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:39.820
bit, but I don't hang
out in Pinterest. You know,

139
00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:42.700
like I'll pin something or
sometimes I'll have like a

140
00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:46.090
30 minute downtime where I
just scroll around Pinterest. But

141
00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:50.080
on like Facebook grass sitting
there for hours, Pinterest is

142
00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:54.550
where I just go to
kind of walk by. So

143
00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:57.670
your blog is, is it
running on WordPress or what

144
00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:59.920
do you, what do you
run? All of these, this

145
00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:02.770
system, All my websites all
were pressed so awesome. He

146
00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:05.200
love his own WordPress. My
other blog, awesomely techie, where

147
00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:09.220
I talk about business and
technologies on WordPress, my mothership

148
00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:14.050
site, lovey.org, where it joins
everything together is on WordPress

149
00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:17.350
too. So I've been using
WordPress basically exclusively through past

150
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:19.750
six years. You know, it
seems a little bit to

151
00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:23.290
me like with people today,
it's not as much a

152
00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:26.680
bright line as it used
to be between techies. And

153
00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.260
non-techies like, when I was
coming up, it was pretty

154
00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.120
clear like, Oh, you're a
techie. I'm not a techie.

155
00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:34.720
We would self-select and we
would separate each other, but

156
00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:39.070
you're not, you're a programmer,
right? No, but I am

157
00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:45.220
a former designer and I
am, I can, I can

158
00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:48.820
do CSS and slid a
little bit of PHP, but

159
00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:51.580
not enough to call myself
a programmer by long shot.

160
00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:53.950
I think you sell yourself
short though, because you could

161
00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:58.380
probably, you know, sharing, sharing
buttons, upgrading WordPress, putting in

162
00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.140
plugins, like this is where
the line gets blurred, where

163
00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.780
like everyone's a techie. Now
you, you, you are your

164
00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:06.080
own techie. Yeah. I mean,
I'm a bit of a

165
00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:11.270
techie just because I love
using technology to do good.

166
00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:15.560
And I also love using
technology to just elevate my

167
00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:18.740
business. So in that way,
that's when I, that's why

168
00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:21.350
I learned how to code
on WordPress. That's why I

169
00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:27.230
learned how to customized a
templates. So because it was

170
00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:28.790
for my own selfish reasons,
I didn't want to always

171
00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:31.400
have to pay somebody to
make any slight change to

172
00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:34.760
my website. Absolutely. And that
we say we should for

173
00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:37.760
your own selfish reasons. And
for, for elevating your business,

174
00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:40.160
did you work in an
office and then do this

175
00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.990
on the side? Or how
did you like escape the

176
00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:44.840
office? Yeah, so I was
working at a full time

177
00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:50.180
job up until April, 2010 and
I was teaching nonprofits how

178
00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:53.210
to use social media to
tell their stories better and

179
00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:56.150
to show their work. So
God laid off that job.

180
00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:58.910
And I haven't had another
full time job since this

181
00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:02.630
has been my full time
job since yeah. Six years.

182
00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:06.380
Did you, did you doubt
at all? Did you, did

183
00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:09.590
you sit there and your
apartment with your computer and

184
00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:11.360
looking at your page views
and just saying, I don't

185
00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.770
know how I'm gonna make
this into a business. Was

186
00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:16.100
there a low point at
all? Oh, absolutely. I didn't

187
00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:17.930
think I was gonna make
it into a business. I

188
00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:19.820
was still looking for other
jobs, but anytime I would

189
00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:22.610
try to get other jobs,
I'd get a new client

190
00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:25.580
to do social media consulting
with, or, you know, I'd

191
00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:28.430
start building somebody else's website
or a brand, we'll say,

192
00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:30.230
Hey, we want you to
do this campaign with this.

193
00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:32.180
So I never got a
chance to get that new

194
00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:35.120
job. Even though every month
I'd be on LinkedIn being

195
00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:40.100
like, okay, let me stop
playing and get a job.

196
00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:43.010
That means that the universe
then is trying to keep

197
00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:45.440
you from working in an
office. Like just when you're

198
00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:46.940
trying to get a job,
the universe brings you a

199
00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:50.180
client, brings you an opportunity.
It was kind of like

200
00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:54.050
pay attention. You're not listening
to me. That's what happened.

201
00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:57.020
And I finally was like,
okay. So I don't think

202
00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:59.690
I'm supposed to be working
in somebody's office. So let's

203
00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:02.990
see if we can make
this thing work And the

204
00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:05.900
numbers keep coming down, like
so large, like I was

205
00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:08.930
looking at your Facebook now
it's almost a quarter of

206
00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:12.560
a million people like this
is legit. Is this the

207
00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:14.390
kind of thing where, you
know how like a story

208
00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:17.750
goes viral and then you
see somebody go from 10,000

209
00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:20.930
to a million to 10 million?
Or is this a little

210
00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:22.550
bit at a time like
slow and steady wins the

211
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:25.190
race. It's a little bit
at a time. I don't

212
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:29.270
place ads on Facebook on
any platform really? Because for

213
00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:31.220
me, I think, you know,
one I've been too lazy

214
00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:36.110
to do it, but I
was just, I love that

215
00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:42.170
you, I don't need ads.
And I kinda just watched

216
00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:45.470
so people would, people naturally
just shared my content cause

217
00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:49.610
they thought it was interesting.
So my, my audience, which

218
00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:52.430
has grown that way, so
I've never sh I think

219
00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:55.570
I've, might've done Facebook ad
ever just to test it

220
00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:58.680
out, but I was like,
eh, underwhelmed. So it sounds

221
00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:01.920
like you really believe in
organic content, like, like get

222
00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:05.520
likes by being likable. Absolutely.
I, you know what, my

223
00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:08.490
biggest pet peeve is are
the people who buy followers.

224
00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:15.520
It is, Oh yeah. Can.
So they're actually soft software

225
00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:20.280
software, and people you can
pay who will skyrocket your

226
00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:24.420
followers. But here's the thing.
When you buy followers who

227
00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:28.440
are robots, you don't get
any engagement. So like I've

228
00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:32.700
seen some Facebook fan pages
that have 400,000 followers, but

229
00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:34.410
then they throw up a
picture that can only get

230
00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:38.010
20 likes. Yes. So that's
really that's where are you

231
00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:41.190
chasing page views or are
you chasing on authentic engagement

232
00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:44.190
and comments In that way?
The people who do that

233
00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:48.720
are chasing just the raw.
Hmm. I think that would

234
00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.370
you, would you say that
when people are out there

235
00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:52.440
thinking about their page views,
that they really should be

236
00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:55.890
thinking about community? They absolutely
should. They should be thinking

237
00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:59.820
about community and content because
content is still King. It

238
00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:01.980
is still King and still
what matters the most. And

239
00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:03.840
when people ask me, like,
how did you grow your

240
00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.930
followers? And I tell them
slowly over time by doing

241
00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:10.170
good work, it sounds like
a con, right? It sounds

242
00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:16.770
like I'm, I'm basically given
them some cliche statement, but

243
00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:20.010
it's absolutely true. I've always
focused on doing work that

244
00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:22.230
I'm proud of and doing
work that is true to

245
00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:25.080
my voice. And that's been
the secret to my success.

246
00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:29.850
It seems like, you know
how they tell you that

247
00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:32.820
you need to like eat
well and sleep well. They

248
00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:34.440
tell you all this stuff
that you need to do

249
00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:37.020
that you know, is good
for you, but it doesn't

250
00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:39.330
like feed you as much.
Like it's like, I just

251
00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:42.120
wanna eat chocolate, but no
eat well. And in 20

252
00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:46.140
years, good things will happen,
right? You're giving us like

253
00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:49.260
the social media strategy for
doing just that, except the

254
00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.350
problem is it's not going
to happen tomorrow. Right. And

255
00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:54.600
I think kind of looking
for the shortcut and I

256
00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:57.360
always say, there's no real
shortcut. That's gonna pay off

257
00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:59.700
in the long run because
yes, you can buy followers.

258
00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:02.760
But if you get hired
to do a campaign and

259
00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:05.640
the brand sees that you
only got 20 likes, even

260
00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:09.930
though you have 400,000 Facebook
fans, that brand is not

261
00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:12.270
going to come back to
you to work with you

262
00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:16.140
again. So instead of chasing
all these short term gains,

263
00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:18.090
you might want to be
in it for the longterm

264
00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:22.500
and get the real money.
So you've taken this from

265
00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:24.900
just being a blog, but
you also, you needed to

266
00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:27.330
make money, right? This needs
to make money. Is it

267
00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:30.210
just a matter of banner
ads? Or can you sell,

268
00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:33.330
can you sell things? Can
you sell, you know, swag?

269
00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:35.850
So I pulled all the
ads off my website a

270
00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:38.340
year ago. You have no
ads, no ads on my

271
00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:40.590
website. And I've had the
most profitable year of my

272
00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:43.590
career. And my decision to
pull the ads off my

273
00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:48.240
site was because ads, since
they're so commonplace, now, they

274
00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:50.280
aren't worth as much as
they used to be worth.

275
00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:52.190
So some people used to
pay their rent off their

276
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:55.460
ads and really have some,
make some money off it.

277
00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:58.550
But over the years, the
value of ads has dropped

278
00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:03.770
considerably. So now I just
do custom campaigns with Brian's

279
00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:06.890
and if they want an
ad on my sidebar, that's

280
00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:09.050
an added value for them
since there are no other

281
00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:13.120
ads to compete with. Ah,
okay. So people can do

282
00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:16.150
like a takeover, Right. But
I still don't even do

283
00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:18.250
those Mo mainly cause I,
again, I always talk to

284
00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:21.460
brands and say, Hey, editorial
content is the best way

285
00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:24.550
I can get your message
out. You know, that's really

286
00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:27.730
interesting because there, there are,
you know, there are brands

287
00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:29.470
that will come to you
or to come to someone

288
00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:30.820
and they'll say, Hey, let's
work with you. And you're

289
00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:33.190
like, really? Why, why should
we work together? It doesn't

290
00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:35.080
seem like a natural thing
at all. You did a

291
00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:39.550
video with bounty that was
like the paper towel people.

292
00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:42.970
And it was cool. Like,
and I don't just say

293
00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:44.530
that because you're my friend
I'm telling you that was

294
00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:47.380
like, wow, how did you
just take paper towels and

295
00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:50.320
turn it into something fun
and authentic and interesting. Wow.

296
00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:53.920
So that bounty ad was
really fun. They came to

297
00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:56.050
me because they wanted to
do this in conjunction with

298
00:15:56.050 --> 00:16:01.120
the Olympics. And they wanted
to kind of match me

299
00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:04.540
with Alison Felix in that
track. And we kind of

300
00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:07.360
built the same cause, and
I don't, I just don't

301
00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:10.240
run, but I do work
out. I just started working

302
00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:12.910
out in April. Cause I
decided I should probably have

303
00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:17.170
healthy heart even though I'm
skinny, but it was important

304
00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:20.500
for me to also make
it, me and bounty is

305
00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:22.300
a product that I use
every single day of my

306
00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:25.600
life. I'm like every day.
So for me, I could

307
00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:28.480
speak very authentically to my
love of bounty and how

308
00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:29.950
I use it every day
and how I use it

309
00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:31.990
when I'm going to the
gym. Cause I'm eating a

310
00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:35.530
bagel. Yeah. See, that was
what I thought was so

311
00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:37.180
funny because it's like, Oh,
there's lovely one and that's

312
00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:39.460
great. She's getting fit. Oh,
there's Larry having a bagel

313
00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:43.480
after the workout. Like I
could see that too. Exactly.

314
00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:45.460
So people who watched who
know me were like, this

315
00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:49.810
was a perfect campaign. Yeah,
yeah, yeah. I did a

316
00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:52.660
thing for Lenovo a while
back and it was kind

317
00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:54.640
of a similar kind of
a deal where it's like,

318
00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:57.100
you know, you can't just
walk in with just any

319
00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:00.250
old brand that you don't
use every day and speak

320
00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:02.470
authentically about. Yeah. You can't
and, and I'm, and I'm

321
00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:04.780
very cognizant of that too.
Like I just got offered

322
00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:08.740
a campaign with like a
movie I don't really watch.

323
00:17:08.830 --> 00:17:10.450
And I told them, I
was like, see, I wouldn't

324
00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:12.700
be able to do this
because I don't really watch

325
00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:15.280
this movie. I haven't watched
the series. I got offered

326
00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:18.760
another campaign from a shoe
company who shoes I do

327
00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:22.030
not like, and I was
like, not, not going to

328
00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:23.530
be able to do it
cause I would not wear

329
00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:26.530
any of those shoes. So
for me, it's important for

330
00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:28.900
my audience to know that
whatever I do, I'm not

331
00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:30.580
just doing it because I'm
getting paid to do it.

332
00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:33.430
I'm doing it because I
actually stand behind it. Yeah,

333
00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:36.430
absolutely. Yeah. I find the
same thing. Like I I'll

334
00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:38.890
recommend like, you know, a
gadget or something and I'll

335
00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:41.520
put an Amazon link and
then Mark that it's a

336
00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:44.800
referral link or whatever. But
people know like if you

337
00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:47.770
build up that trust over
years, it's like, I'm telling

338
00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:50.670
you that this, this iPhone
case or this router or

339
00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:53.970
this, you know, whatever is
legit and trust me, you're

340
00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:57.570
whole you're you're, you're standing
behind it. Right? Yeah, absolutely.

341
00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:03.330
So you, you also sell
like swag and stuff. Those,

342
00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:06.090
the swag though comes the
tee shirts and mugs, it

343
00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:10.500
comes from like saying that
you've developed over time because

344
00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:12.870
you have to like find
a voice or is this

345
00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:15.440
like who you have always
been? This is who I've

346
00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:18.050
always been, which makes my
life a little bit easier

347
00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:20.810
because if I was writing
in a voice that was

348
00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:23.000
not really mine. And I
had to think about it

349
00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.640
too hard. I probably would
not be writing this often

350
00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:28.880
or I probably wouldn't even
be at the level I'm

351
00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:31.670
in because I just wouldn't
love it as much as

352
00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:34.580
I do. So this has
always been me and people

353
00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:36.440
who read my blog and
know me in real life

354
00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:38.150
will say like, I actually
heard your voice when I

355
00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:42.260
was reading words, which lets
me know. Yes, I am

356
00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:46.640
showing who I am. Yeah.
Cause you're doing it right.

357
00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:48.740
Like if you think about
Stephen Colbert or we're all

358
00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:51.860
still freaking out because it's
like, wait a second. He

359
00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:54.020
wasn't that guy like, well,
who is this guy? Like?

360
00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:59.930
Right, right. Yeah. I'm looking,
I'm just sitting here scrolling

361
00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:03.440
through some of your, some
of your things that you

362
00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:05.810
have a website called tees
in the trap where you've

363
00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:09.230
got all of your different
travel mugs and stuff. And

364
00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:11.150
one of the things that
I, that you've always done,

365
00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:15.320
as long as I've known
you is spelling words, phonetically

366
00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:18.980
like the way I like
to say that you spell

367
00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:23.930
words the way it feels
in your mouth. Yeah. That's

368
00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:27.740
exactly. You know what I
mean? Like even in your

369
00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:29.270
book, like I'm looking at
your book right here at

370
00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:31.430
the end of it, you
talk about how, you know,

371
00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:33.440
you thank you and everything.
And you talk about how

372
00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:36.020
God is good and you
say he's, God is good

373
00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:39.740
all the time. And you
spell it like all a

374
00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:43.640
T H a and all
the time, all caps. Because

375
00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:47.090
that's exactly how it feels
in your mind. You like

376
00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:49.280
that. You can use them.
Let's do that. Cause that's

377
00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:53.200
a great way to put
it into how I presented

378
00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:56.270
on paper. And it's so
funny because a couple years

379
00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:59.360
ago, when you started doing
this, like in earnest, the

380
00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:02.270
spellcheck people would show up
and they missed the joke.

381
00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:06.380
Yeah. Yeah. So the newbies
still be like, wait, what?

382
00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:09.590
And I'm like read the
glossary, understand what is happening

383
00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:12.170
here. I know the rules
of English. That's why I

384
00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:15.110
can break them. Okay. We
know the rules you can

385
00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:17.840
break. Well, and that's the
thing about good writing though,

386
00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:20.030
right? I mean, do we
need to put stuff in

387
00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:22.130
Italax to show people that
we're spelling it wrong and

388
00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:24.620
we know, do you need
like roll with it? Like

389
00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:26.510
we know English, let's assume
that if you've written a

390
00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:29.390
book that you, you know,
have a good understanding of

391
00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:31.670
the language and now you're
playing with the language and

392
00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:34.610
that's, what's so fun is
the play exactly. It's the

393
00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:37.820
bending of the rules. And
you know, I think people

394
00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:41.330
read it and they laugh
because they're like, Oh yeah.

395
00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:43.220
Cause when you read it
out loud, you're like, that's

396
00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:47.260
exactly how I said it.
So I'm looking at the

397
00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:50.200
book, I've got an advanced
edition, says I'm judging you.

398
00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:54.160
And there's a picture of
a red lollipop on the

399
00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:57.310
front. And he looks like
he's judging me. He's got

400
00:20:57.310 --> 00:21:01.170
a side eye. Yes. That
is judgey. Pop has a

401
00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:05.700
name and an Instagram account
now because yes. Does he

402
00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:08.040
pop as his own instincts
when a boy or girl

403
00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:10.230
does it matter Is whatever
you want it to be.

404
00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:13.230
And it has its own
Instagram account because people will

405
00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:16.710
not take the actual lollipop
with them to have adventures

406
00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:18.900
and they take it around
the world. So it's been

407
00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:21.270
to London, it's been to
Vienna. It's been to the

408
00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:25.530
San Francisco MoMA. So I
plan on having judgy pop,

409
00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:28.560
come with me around the
world. Whenever I go out

410
00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:32.670
the country myself next, next
year, This is like the,

411
00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:34.890
like the garden gnome. But
it's so much better because

412
00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:37.020
the garden gnome just smiles.
When you take them around.

413
00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:39.090
I love that. I can
actually see people and then

414
00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:43.680
judge them. Exactly. And it's
really fun because I always

415
00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:47.010
see somebody, I always see
what people tag to it

416
00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:49.650
on Instagram now. So like
they have their babies holding

417
00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:52.920
it. Cause you know, babies
are super judgy. Babies are

418
00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:55.920
judging and people don't even
know Exactly like babies are

419
00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:57.300
the best thing that would
cause they just look at

420
00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:01.080
you like you should do
better. So, So, so when,

421
00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:02.940
when people see this, there's
someone there's going to be

422
00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:04.590
someone out there who's going
to take this seriously. And

423
00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:08.100
like I'm judging you the
do better manual, but it's

424
00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:11.250
both serious and funny. I
mean, it's, it's hilarious to

425
00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:13.530
the entire book, but at
the same time you are

426
00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:15.570
telling people to do better
and you are judging them.

427
00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:18.150
Yeah. And I'm judging myself
along with them. Cause you

428
00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:19.680
know, like things like the
fact that I can't be

429
00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:22.230
on time for anything, I
kicked off the book with

430
00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:27.090
that, you know, this book,
it's kind of the conscience

431
00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:30.540
of culture. It's, it's the
good angel on our shoulder.

432
00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:34.550
That's kinda like, Hmm. You
should probably do better. Should

433
00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:39.240
probably not be a hateful
person. You should probably be

434
00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:43.350
a little bit more gentle
with yourself. And while you're

435
00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:45.150
at it, you should probably
leave this world a little

436
00:22:45.150 --> 00:22:48.510
bit better than you found
it. Yeah, absolutely. You go

437
00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:50.460
through you, you cover everything
in this book. Now you

438
00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:52.350
broken it up into a
couple of sections. You've got

439
00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:57.840
life, culture, social media and
fame. And you definitely, it's

440
00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:00.300
interesting because I see pictures
of you online with famous

441
00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:05.100
people all the time, including
my girl Lupita, you need

442
00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:08.520
to get a message to
her from me. But, but

443
00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:12.240
you also talk about this
thing called microwave fame. Yeah.

444
00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:15.660
Do you think that like,
are we going from like,

445
00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:17.730
is it 15 minutes of
fame? Like what was it?

446
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.950
Who's the guy that said
that. I can't remember who

447
00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:22.890
said it, but like in
the future, everyone will want

448
00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:27.510
their 15 minutes of fame.
Yeah. Who was that? Andy

449
00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:32.610
Warhol. Right? That's happening though.
Like people want to be

450
00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:34.890
famous just cause they think
that, Oh, I, I invented

451
00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:37.920
this word or I did
this vine. Now give me

452
00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:40.320
a TV show. You know,
that's become a thing that

453
00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:43.470
actually is kind of weird
because people are now doing

454
00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:47.950
anything they can to famous,
which is a problem. Yeah.

455
00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:51.550
I mean, because they'll take
foolishness and then just put

456
00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:53.830
it online or they'll, they'll
like, gosh, they've been some

457
00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:56.020
horrible things where people have
been, you know, berating their

458
00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:59.320
kids and putting it online.
And it's like you say

459
00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:02.170
here that the internet has
normalized this culture of dishonesty.

460
00:24:02.650 --> 00:24:05.080
It has because now everyone
is like, Oh my gosh,

461
00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:07.600
what can I throw up
on Instagram to be famous

462
00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:10.480
today? What can I do
to get everyone's attention? Even

463
00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:12.670
if it's not really what
I'm supposed to be doing.

464
00:24:12.670 --> 00:24:16.480
So that is something that
I'm seeing that I'm hoping

465
00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:21.340
we get to pull in
a little bit. Yeah. Like

466
00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:24.130
if you think about what
was the swimmer say, I'm

467
00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:27.100
actually, I'm actually consciously forgetting
the swimmer's name because I

468
00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:28.960
don't want to give him
any more fame, but you

469
00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:32.920
know, the one that goes
and doesn't get, doesn't get

470
00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:37.600
robbed in, in Rio, you
know, he was probably just

471
00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:40.750
trying to like subconsciously just
be more famous, like, Oh

472
00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:43.180
this will be a great
story. I'll just tell everyone

473
00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:45.280
and I'll be more famous
and it'll be hilarious. I'll

474
00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:46.840
go on the tonight. You
know, the today show and

475
00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:49.780
talk about it. Yeah. It's
kind of ridiculous. The lens

476
00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:56.230
we would go to to
get attention. It's so ridiculous.

477
00:24:56.590 --> 00:25:02.620
And I'm hoping that like,
we, we stop rewarding this

478
00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:07.540
behavior. It's hard though, because
you know, even with kids,

479
00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:11.050
they'll put a video on,
on Instagram and they'll wait,

480
00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:13.030
you know like, Oh, I've
got three likes. I can

481
00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:15.430
four likes. I don't know.
I don't know if I

482
00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:18.220
want my kids online. If
that's what we're sending them

483
00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:20.050
into a world of, I
want them to go into

484
00:25:20.050 --> 00:25:21.640
like love nation. I want
them to go into a

485
00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:24.220
loving community, not a community
that is just going to

486
00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:27.490
reward that. Well, I also
think it's important for you

487
00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:31.210
to have a strong sense
of self. So because the

488
00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:36.370
internet can, can mold you
into who it thinks you

489
00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:39.700
should be. If you're a
strong person who knows who

490
00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:42.340
you are, what your core
values are, you're able to

491
00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:46.060
deal with some of these
temptations and the like culture

492
00:25:46.090 --> 00:25:49.240
better. But if you're kind
of like, I don't really

493
00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:54.100
know, then it's going to
eat you up Steep because

494
00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:56.500
yeah, if you, if you
enter the internet as just

495
00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:59.680
a piece of clay, like
it depends on who you

496
00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:04.120
bump into first. Exactly. Who
who's there to mold your

497
00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:10.450
Play-Doh. So yeah. So you
are going to go on

498
00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:14.110
tour and how many cities
are you going to hit?

499
00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:22.170
I am currently scheduled to
hit like 14 cities. I

500
00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:23.560
don't, I don't know how
you do it. You gotta

501
00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:25.690
be tired. Oh man. That's
why I'm sitting down for

502
00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:28.780
the next two weeks before
the book launches to kind

503
00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:32.140
of get my breath back.
Because once this fall starts,

504
00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:36.580
it's going to be nuts.
Do you feel like this,

505
00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:39.550
the book launch is going
better than, than you thought?

506
00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:40.630
I mean, like I knew
it was going to go

507
00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:43.710
go well, but I've been
seeing famous people on the

508
00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:46.680
online with your book and
it's not the kind of

509
00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:48.390
famous people where like someone
gave them a book and

510
00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:51.720
said, take a picture. It's
like they are legitimately interested

511
00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:54.150
in your book. You like
Amy Poehler with your book.

512
00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:56.670
I saw Ava DuVernay with
your book. I saw Shonda

513
00:26:56.670 --> 00:27:00.350
Rhimes with your book. Yeah.
Yeah. It's it's, it's been,

514
00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:03.440
it's actually blown my mind.
Cause I didn't expect the

515
00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:05.510
feedback that it would be
getting to be so good.

516
00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:09.920
And that's, that was basically
let's move that. I did

517
00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:12.530
something really good here. You,
you, you touched on a

518
00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:16.510
nerve, like there was a
vacuum out there and that

519
00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:19.790
this book was wanted and,
and you know, maybe the

520
00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:22.250
world didn't even know they
wanted the book. Right. And

521
00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:24.050
I think it was also
the right time for it.

522
00:27:24.050 --> 00:27:26.180
Cause there's a lot happening
right now that people kind

523
00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:29.390
of want to talk through
and people have the frustrations

524
00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:32.720
about, so it's kind of
right on time. You realize

525
00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:34.790
of course that like, they're
going to want like part

526
00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:37.730
two. Some people have been
asking me about part two.

527
00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:41.390
I'm like, Oh my God.
It's not even now. Oh

528
00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:43.280
yeah. People talk about some
part too. I'm like, Oh

529
00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:45.260
man. Well part two would
be like, I'm still judging

530
00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:50.180
you. You continue to disappoint.
Right. You continue to just

531
00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:54.500
do, haven't done better. I'm
back. Oh my goodness. Yeah.

532
00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:58.130
It's true though. Did you
write this all in one,

533
00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:00.320
like sitting or is this
one of those like 500

534
00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:03.080
words a day for several
months? Like, cause I need,

535
00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:05.870
you know, I've been working
on my relationship book for

536
00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:09.290
as long as I've known
you, but I just, what

537
00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:11.000
is, what is the trick?
Well, I got to just

538
00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:12.740
drink a lot of coffee.
How did you do it?

539
00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:15.920
And, and a and B
having a contract with a

540
00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:18.470
deadline that says you would,
you, you have to do

541
00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:21.560
this by this day. But
also I think I wrote

542
00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:24.050
a book proposal that gave
me clarity on what this

543
00:28:24.050 --> 00:28:26.540
book needed to be about.
So when it was time

544
00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:29.570
for me to write it,
I had 17 pages of

545
00:28:29.570 --> 00:28:32.630
chapter summaries already to refer
back to if I had

546
00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:37.340
any type of block, but
having an outline beforehand paid

547
00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:41.630
off by dividends because I
had a strong sense of,

548
00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:42.990
okay, this is what I'm
going to do next. This

549
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.420
is what the next chapter
is going to be about

550
00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:47.120
already. So I think you
might need to have a

551
00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:50.240
planning session with yourself as
opposed to just writing blindly.

552
00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:53.030
Oh, okay. That's a really
good point. You're right. Because

553
00:28:53.030 --> 00:28:54.710
if you do go out
there and just like, Hey,

554
00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:55.970
I'm gonna write a book.
I got the book in

555
00:28:55.970 --> 00:28:58.070
me. I'm just going to
slap the keyboard in the

556
00:28:58.070 --> 00:29:00.680
book's gonna pop up. It's
not, you have to, like,

557
00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:02.750
I wrote an outline first.
And then I wrote my

558
00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:06.110
chapter summaries and then the
book came out of those,

559
00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:08.510
like in the chapter summary
in the outline are probably

560
00:29:08.510 --> 00:29:12.590
about 70% accurate to what's
in the book. Really? Yeah.

561
00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:15.200
It was pretty, it was
pretty dead on. So that

562
00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:18.590
flushing out process it's just
is so important. It is.

563
00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:20.450
It is. It's what is
going to make the difference

564
00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:23.150
between you finishing and you
just spend in time still

565
00:29:23.150 --> 00:29:26.840
typing random words. Yeah. You
know, I just clicked on

566
00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:30.440
Amazon. Do you know? It
still says number one release

567
00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:34.040
in humor and literary criticism.
That is cool. Oh man.

568
00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:37.490
Like, you know how sometimes
people will like a book

569
00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:40.490
will come out and then
they'll take the screenshot of

570
00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:42.550
the five that the book
is at number one because

571
00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:44.950
you know, it, it, this
has been sitting here for

572
00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:47.970
awhile. Yeah. It's actually been
doing pretty well on Amazon

573
00:29:47.970 --> 00:29:51.990
for a bit. So that's
cool. You know, you need

574
00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:54.180
to actually get up here
and take a screenshot because

575
00:29:54.510 --> 00:29:59.370
the top three hot new
releases and humor. Oh that's

576
00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:03.480
okay. Wow. I'll take a
screenshot because it is your

577
00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:06.780
paperback, your audible book and
your Kindle edition or all

578
00:30:07.290 --> 00:30:11.490
the hot new release right
now. That is dope. I

579
00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:14.190
did not know. That was
the thing. And then yeah,

580
00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:15.870
I'll put the link right
here and then somebody, you

581
00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:21.120
know, some sad person. Wow.
That's cool. I didn't even

582
00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:24.450
notice that. That's great. I'm
really, I'm just so happy

583
00:30:24.450 --> 00:30:27.290
for you. This is going
to be huge. I, I,

584
00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:29.040
you know, what's and also,
you know, what's crazy. It's

585
00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:33.720
already getting TV. It's already
getting TV attention. You mean

586
00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:35.460
like being on the today
show or something? Are you

587
00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:38.190
going to have a TV
show? No, like it's already

588
00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:40.260
like two people have already
reached out to my agent,

589
00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:43.890
like, Hey, are off auction,
no option in rights available

590
00:30:43.890 --> 00:30:46.380
for this book. Wow. How
would you do that? Like,

591
00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:48.960
would you make a, would
it be like a comedy,

592
00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:51.840
like a, you imagine a
talk show or you mean

593
00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:54.510
like, like, like someone else
is going to play Lovie?

594
00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:59.760
I don't know, but yeah.
So That'd be crazy. It

595
00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:01.530
could be like the Carmichael
show or something and you

596
00:31:01.530 --> 00:31:06.090
could be the middle person,
right? The main point. But

597
00:31:06.090 --> 00:31:08.280
you know what? I don't
really necessarily want to act.

598
00:31:08.850 --> 00:31:11.970
I would rather write a
show than be the person

599
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.220
acting in it. You know
what people would want to

600
00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:15.930
see you though? I mean,
you could just please be,

601
00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:19.170
you just play yourself true
and then let everyone else

602
00:31:19.170 --> 00:31:23.710
play around you. True. I'm
just saying that could work

603
00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:27.360
because the only place person
I can please myself. Well,

604
00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:29.400
you remember that if you,
you know, when it comes

605
00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:31.290
time to cast, if you
need white Scott to come

606
00:31:31.290 --> 00:31:37.440
by, I'll be the neighbor.
So people can check this

607
00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:41.310
