From hanselminutes.com. It's Hanselman. It's
a weekly discussion with web

2
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.860
developer and technologist Scott Hanselman.
This is Lawrence Ryan announcing show

3
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:29.460
number one 83. Recorded live
Friday, October 10th, 2009. Support for Hanselman

4
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.660
it's is provided by Tellerik
rad controls, the most comprehensive

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:46.320
online@wwwdottelerik.com. In this episode, recorded
with a group of Ustream

7
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.400
and Twitter users. Scott talks
about gadgets, webcams high Def

8
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:55.190
and more. Hi, this is
Scott Hanselman, and this is

9
00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.320
another episode of Hansel minutes,
except this is a very

10
00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.860
strange, very sad, very live
very internet episode of Hansel

11
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.460
minutes. In fact, it is
Friday night at 2:00 AM. The

12
00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.910
children are asleep, the wife
is asleep and I'm talking

13
00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.600
to you guys. We're on
ustream.tv in a channel called

14
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.450
handsome and it's live with
35 other pathetic humans actually

15
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.060
forgive me. You're not pathetic
human. If you are in

16
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.640
another time zone, I would
give great respect to the

17
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.000
people in Sweden and Australia
who were actually up at

18
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.670
a reasonable hour. It's the
people on the West coast

19
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.060
that we feel we feel
bad for much respect to

20
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.280
Andrew in the UK. See,
one of the things that

21
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.990
we get to do here
on Ustream is we can

22
00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.720
see people chatting while I'm
talking. So I will recording

23
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.960
the show. It's also going
out live to a massive

24
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.460
audience of three now 34
people. In fact, one last

25
00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.770
we've already lost a viewer.
This is the kind of

26
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.140
high quality recording that we
are going to give people

27
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.720
a here on the Hansel
minutes, I guess it is

28
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.720
Saturday morning. It's Friday night,
Saturday morning. It is 2:00 AM

29
00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.900
on Saturday. Very, very sad.
So what I wanted to

30
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.540
do on this episode is
I was sitting here in

31
00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.970
my office and I looked
around and I noticed that

32
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.740
there's just a ridiculous amount
of gadgetry and crap sitting

33
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.780
on my desk. And I
thought it would be interesting

34
00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.000
to do kind of a
review of some of these

35
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.850
interesting tools I've been playing
with lately. We got lots

36
00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.220
of stuff going on. We've
got people from all over

37
00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.900
the world. We got a
guy from Poland. We got

38
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.700
a guy from the UK.
We got my buddy long

39
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.320
from, I started something.com he's
on from Australia. Hopefully more

40
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.510
people will show up from
Twitter and I can take

41
00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.350
their questions about these gadgets
and some of the technology

42
00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.410
here on the, on the
Ustream. So very, very cool.

43
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.470
So let me think here.
It's really been a multimedia

44
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.760
couple of a couple of
days for me. I've got

45
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.360
my, my classic Zune and
this is the radio portion

46
00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.770
where I actually hold up
the, the, the product and

47
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.510
the people who are listening
to this in their cars

48
00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.910
and their commutes have no
idea what I'm doing. I've

49
00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.250
got my old zoom. This
is my 30, my 30

50
00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.840
gigs June. And then I've
got my new shiny edition

51
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.430
of the Zune HD. I'm
showing the viewers here. This

52
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.670
is the custom Scott Hanselman
engraved version of the red

53
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.610
zoon HD. I put my
URLs on the back and

54
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.560
I posted a picture that's
on Twitter. And the first

55
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:20.020
comment was what you forgot
your own website. Not, not

56
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.260
cool. This is awesome because
no one will steal my

57
00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.930
zoom now because they're going
to go to the URL.

58
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.610
They're going to see my
smiling face when I lose

59
00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.560
it. And they're going to
mail it back to me,

60
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.650
loving the new Zune. I
hold these up to each

61
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.410
other. You can see the,
the blocky chunky kind of

62
00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.810
Fred Flinstone ask Zune original
edition and in the incredibly

63
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.620
sleek zoon HD, it's really,
really nice. And I've actually,

64
00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.020
I, if I just happened
to have an eye touch,

65
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.450
I see there I go
saying, I touch. I just

66
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.180
defended both of the Apple
Gates in the room, an

67
00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.330
iPod touch, and I hold
it up next to it.

68
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.500
You can see that the
Zune is really, really small.

69
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.860
The Zune is, is this
strange place in between an

70
00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:08.200
iPod and an iPod nano
it's really, really small. And

71
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.220
the screen on this thing
is bananas. I I'm telling

72
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.160
you, even if you turn
the screen up on brightness,

73
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.030
on the iPod to the
brightest, the Zune HD screen

74
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.330
is the O led. This
is the organic led screen.

75
00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.920
And this thing is ridiculous.
The Zune has got so

76
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.890
much extra graphics power that
they even have a little

77
00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:36.010
screen, a little like screensaver.
So when you're playing music

78
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.850
with somebody, somebody famous, like
maybe playing music with like

79
00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.210
Beyonce or somebody they'll they'll
have stuff going on in

80
00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.760
the background, actually I'm showing
the folks on Ustream here.

81
00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.960
An episode of high definition,
episode of heroes. The irony

82
00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.030
of course, is that because
it's three in the morning,

83
00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.080
the people who are listening
to Hanselman is live. Don't

84
00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.990
have the ability to get
this product. I don't know

85
00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.900
why these things happen that
way. Why a few folks

86
00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.800
overseas don't get these things,
but, but we do the,

87
00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.190
the, the album art on
this is really amazing because

88
00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.040
they don't just have the
art for the album on

89
00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.380
the Zune HD, but they
also have wallpaper going on

90
00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.840
in the background. And then
after a little while, when

91
00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.810
you're playing this, it'll switch
over into this kind of

92
00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.450
like entertainment mode where it
just like here, I'm showing

93
00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.720
Beyonce just being awesome. And
then you get kind of

94
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.050
that Ken burns effect, the
Ken burns the documentary filmmaker

95
00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.070
on PBS public broadcasting here
in the U S he,

96
00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.530
this is the, the whole,
let's take a static photo

97
00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.860
and pan really slowly, and
then suddenly it, it feels

98
00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.620
more dynamic. So now we've
actually got the Zune HD

99
00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:45.520
in beyond same mode and
a much respect to the

100
00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.670
folks in the chat room
who are, or appreciating this,

101
00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.060
the battery life on the,
on the Zune is fantastic

102
00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.030
as well. I haven't had
any problems at all. It

103
00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:58.520
really is a shame that
this didn't come out earlier

104
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.540
because the Zune is it's,
it's prettier than the iPod.

105
00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:05.870
It's more fun than the
iPod. It, but it doesn't,

106
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:08.390
it doesn't have a phone.
And this is the part

107
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:14.090
that just kills me. It
is truly the best MP3

108
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:17.330
player that I've, that I've
ever had. It's, it's fantastic

109
00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.060
for podcasts, but I keep
wanting to pick it up

110
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:22.970
and make a call and
it just doesn't happen. We

111
00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:26.060
just don't have that. We
don't have that support. One

112
00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.160
of the things though, that
is comforting about the zoom

113
00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:34.250
to me is that the
UI is so right. They've

114
00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:37.340
got this so correct that
I think we may actually

115
00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:41.900
pull off windows, windows, mobile.
We all know that windows

116
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:45.770
mobile, 6.5 is not windows
mobile, seven. It's kind of

117
00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.130
an evolutionary thing. They got
some sheen on it, but

118
00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:52.700
people still complain about the
old UI. The Zune is

119
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:55.610
completely different in the way
that it deals with, with

120
00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:59.270
user interface. And it actually
succeeds in making an iPod

121
00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:02.030
look old. And I don't
say this as a Microsoft

122
00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:04.550
shill. I say this as
a guy who has purchased

123
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:09.920
basically every device that has
ever existed, if it is

124
00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:13.010
a piece of software, I
have installed it. And if

125
00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:15.500
it is a gadget, I
have purchased it. This is

126
00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:19.970
the sadness. That is my
life. I'm so seriously. The

127
00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:22.430
Zune HD is a joy.
The other thing about the

128
00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:25.070
Zune that is amazing of
course, is the Zune pass.

129
00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:28.670
This is the ability to
lease music and it's kind

130
00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:31.490
of complicated. The Zune pass
is a shame. I don't,

131
00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.230
I think this is not
actually taking off with the

132
00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:39.020
kids because it's hard to
explain basically, 15 bucks a

133
00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:41.480
month for the price of
one CD. You can lease

134
00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.310
as much music as you
want. You can listen all

135
00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:47.780
day long to music. And
as a bonus, you get

136
00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:52.430
10 free songs that are
actually MP3s. So you're not,

137
00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:54.890
then you would think that
would be the elevator speech,

138
00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:56.390
but then people go wait
a second. When I get

139
00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:59.810
to rent music and I
get 10 MP3. So wait

140
00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:03.530
a second. What exactly happens
there? You're you, you are

141
00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:06.530
paying 15 bucks a month,
1499. You get 10 songs.

142
00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:09.830
They're MP3s. When June goes
away and Microsoft is gone

143
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:12.140
and it's just nothing left.
You still have that music

144
00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:17.240
it's MP3s, and then you
can lease as much music

145
00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:20.540
as you want. So for
example, let's see who I've

146
00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:23.510
got here. I'm looking at
my, my Zune for something

147
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:27.800
that I would not ordinarily
ordinarily listen to Avril Levine.

148
00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:31.730
Okay. I can't, I cannot
be held responsible for this.

149
00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:34.520
Someone in my house decided
at some point that something

150
00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:41.060
Avril living did was inoffensive,
probably my wife, she then

151
00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:43.370
said, Oh, I like that
song. And then she said,

152
00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:46.340
Oh, well, crap. I'll just
take them all. And then

153
00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:48.710
suddenly after living in showed
up at my zone, of

154
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:53.360
course, this actually gets sinked
wirelessly. So the zoom never

155
00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.380
actually has to touch my
computer. It actually sits in

156
00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:57.600
the, in the front of
the, the living room there

157
00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.760
right next to the TV.
Cause this happens to be

158
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.400
the HD zone. We just
dock it next to our

159
00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:06.000
big HDTV. The wife's got
a remote control. She can

160
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.270
control all of this music
from there. And it doesn't

161
00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:11.760
have to think about this.
It automatically syncs kind of

162
00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:14.520
overnight. I've caught it sinking
itself. A couple of times

163
00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.170
I've snuck up on the
Zune and found it doing

164
00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:20.130
this. Here's the other cool
thing, because the Zune HD

165
00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:23.280
has wireless. I can also
browse the web. It's got

166
00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:25.890
like an <inaudible> on six
on six, the kind of

167
00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:28.830
browser that they had in
the new windows. Mobile had

168
00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:31.590
a little more advanced. So
it's got the pinchy Safari

169
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:34.530
thing going, but here's the
cool part. I scroll down

170
00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:36.720
to the bottom of the
Avril Levine and it says

171
00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:42.030
the marketplace discography, this is
a part of what gets

172
00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:44.100
sinked. So even though we
only sinked a couple of

173
00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:48.300
Avril Levine albums, they included
in the sink packet, not

174
00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:51.570
only the, the album covers
and all the songs, as

175
00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:54.840
well as the wallpaper, but
in fact, all of admirals,

176
00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:58.290
other albums that I don't
care about. Look at that

177
00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:01.470
Aberly beans put out a
lot of stuff. Yes. Someone

178
00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:04.560
online just said the long
tail sale, this has actually

179
00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:06.390
happened a couple of times
where I was listening to

180
00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:11.820
my favorite comedian patent Oswald.
It was incredibly offensive. And

181
00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.100
if you like being offended,
you should listen to patent

182
00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:17.010
stuff. And then I clicked
on marketplace. Desal graphy found

183
00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:20.670
two albums. I didn't know,
patent did hit download and

184
00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:25.050
instantly wirelessly quote unquote, bought
them, lease them from the

185
00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:30.090
Zune. That's a pretty cool
experience and a big, you

186
00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:32.700
know, big props for Microsoft
for pulling this off. If

187
00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:35.640
windows seven looks anything like
this, if I can go

188
00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:38.610
like, Hey, it's a zoom.
It's great. Hello. Yes. One

189
00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:40.830
moment. I'll be right there.
That would be a killer

190
00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:43.290
thing. And this is, this
actually gets to another thing

191
00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:46.470
about Microsoft and working as
a, as a professional Microsoft

192
00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:48.810
shell is that, of course
I worked for the developer

193
00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:50.850
division. So my job is
to make people successful in

194
00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:54.720
C sharp, not to sell
Zunes, but I was at

195
00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:58.320
my windows seven launch party
yesterday with a few other

196
00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.780
nerds and people on people
on Facebook who showed up.

197
00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:04.980
And I actually found myself
saying, gosh, it's nice to

198
00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:06.540
work for a company where
I don't have to be

199
00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:10.050
kind of completely ashamed of
what we did. You know,

200
00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:13.200
windows seven is just such
a joy and the Zune

201
00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.960
is kicking butt and the
Xbox is awesome. And I

202
00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:18.570
was like, wow, we don't,
we don't completely suck right

203
00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:20.370
now. And that just made
me feel really awesome about

204
00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:23.670
working for Microsoft. Speaking of
things from Microsoft that don't

205
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:27.000
suck, check this out. This
just came in the mail.

206
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.610
This is my Microsoft life
cam cinema 50 bucks. My

207
00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:34.920
friends, I think it's retails
for 80, but you know

208
00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:36.840
the internet. So I've got
a way for you to

209
00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:40.260
get these things for cheaper.
Got this with the being

210
00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:45.000
cashback. This is the life
cam HD. This is a

211
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.370
$50 camera. It's a tiny
little webcam and it does

212
00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:54.730
full HD, 1280 by seven
20 P. I actually bought

213
00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:56.980
two. I didn't just buy
two so I could hold

214
00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:58.530
one in front of the
camera and have the, the

215
00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:00.760
one that I'm using pointed
at it. But I needed

216
00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:03.400
one for the wife and
one for myself. So when

217
00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:05.860
I leave and go on
trips, I can talk to

218
00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:08.860
the kids in HD. So
the deal with this is

219
00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:12.430
we've got a full 16
by nine, a seven, 20

220
00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:16.300
P H D camera. It'll
do all the different resolutions

221
00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:18.490
from a four by three,
all the way up to

222
00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:21.430
full 1280 by seven 20
P it's got an actual

223
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:25.630
glass lens. The only problem
with this is that it

224
00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:28.960
doesn't have the software to
really back it up. A

225
00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:30.880
couple of people online here
are saying that they read

226
00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.770
the blog post. You may
have seen me blog about

227
00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:35.080
this. If you go to
my blog and hanselman.com, I've

228
00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:37.360
got a number of tips
on how you can actually

229
00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:41.530
hack Skype to do full
HD on this by actually

230
00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:45.700
messing with their configs. Here's
the tragedy though, from what

231
00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:48.610
I can tell and the
disclaimer, of course, on my

232
00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:50.410
blogging in this talk here
is that I don't know

233
00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:52.330
these people, right? I just
bought this. I don't know

234
00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:54.430
the guys on this team,
but you need a beefy

235
00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:57.010
machine to run this thing.
You need a machine with

236
00:12:57.010 --> 00:13:00.640
some hootspa for lack of
a better word. I have

237
00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:03.970
a quad proc. And when
I was encoding, fully two

238
00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:07.210
of my processors were we're
working to get that thing

239
00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:08.770
and coded to talk to
the other side. I was

240
00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:13.150
talking to Brad Wilson actually,
but HD, it was rocking

241
00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:16.030
suite. And then I ended
up calling Jeff Atwood from

242
00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:19.430
coding horror, and we tried
to find a balance. We

243
00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:21.670
hooked it up at six
40 by four 80. And

244
00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:24.850
that wasn't kind of nice
is once it's like, once

245
00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:26.830
you see a DVD on
a wide screen and suddenly

246
00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:28.480
you don't want to do
it anymore, you don't want

247
00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.640
to do the four by
three square. And it was

248
00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:35.080
funny. Jeff was saying he
would actually prefer a 16

249
00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:38.380
by nine low res version
of me as a video

250
00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:41.050
chat than a square once
he'd seen it. So we

251
00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:42.790
ended up finding a halfway
Mark. I think it was

252
00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:46.450
like nine 60 by five
44 or something like that.

253
00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:49.960
Basically a 16 by nine
rectangular shape. That was slightly

254
00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:54.340
less than HD, but clearly
better than DVD quality. And

255
00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:57.250
even though I'm sure there
were some tricks of motion

256
00:13:57.250 --> 00:14:00.310
and some pretty hardcore compression
going on, it was like

257
00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:02.530
being there. And I definitely
plan on hooking up the,

258
00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:05.080
the Hansel portal, which is
the machine that I use

259
00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:06.730
to talk to Phil hack.
That's over here to my

260
00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:09.280
right, with one of these
cameras. And I love these

261
00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:11.380
cameras so much. I actually
sent one to everyone on

262
00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:13.150
my team cause I'm a
manager. Now I can do

263
00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:15.430
stuff like that. So everyone
on the team got one

264
00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:19.240
of these. So as I
understand it, looking at one

265
00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:22.060
of the questions here, messenger
doesn't seem to do HD

266
00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:24.460
chat. The word on the
street is that it, you

267
00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:26.500
know, that it will. And
I, when I say word

268
00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:28.240
on the street, that implies
that I know something, I

269
00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:31.180
don't, it in fact means
don't you think they would

270
00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:33.160
do it when someone comes
out with a piece of

271
00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.680
hardware like this, and it
says right there in bold

272
00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.630
face, bigger than Skype, look
at the bottom of the

273
00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:40.420
box here. It says works
with windows messenger and that's

274
00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:43.510
the, they made the font
twice as big. Yeah, that's

275
00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:46.600
because it's probably gonna work
with windows messenger. So I

276
00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:48.730
have no doubt that at
some point in the future

277
00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:50.500
in awesome version of windows,
messages is going to come

278
00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:54.020
out that supports, but I've
used it on office communicator,

279
00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:58.490
live meeting Skype who VU
O O V O that

280
00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:00.800
lets you do up to
six people. And they're talking

281
00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:03.410
about HD as well, as
well as windows live messenger.

282
00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:07.520
And it works awesome. This
camera works immediately with live

283
00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:10.100
messenger and switches into DVD
mode, which is basically six

284
00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:12.200
40 by four ADP. As
soon as you go full

285
00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:14.660
screen and you have enough
bandwidth, it says a little

286
00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:17.690
thing at the bottom says,
Oh, you're in high quality

287
00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:21.260
mode. So very, very cool.
And as I understand that

288
00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.480
there's support somewhere in office
communicator for this kind of

289
00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:28.880
stuff as well, but again,
all speculation. So I think

290
00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:32.000
that the, the, the takeaway
there is that the hardware

291
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.970
for HD is happening. It
is clear that at some

292
00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:37.490
point the software will we'll
we'll work it out to

293
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.700
the Skype thing that I've
logged about is clearly a

294
00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:44.600
hack. And, but I'm sure
that the people are working

295
00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:48.230
on this, whether it be
office communicator, live messenger, interestingly,

296
00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:49.910
and as I said in
the blog post, the thing

297
00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:52.910
that's going to make HD
chat work is that everything

298
00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:54.770
else has to work. I
mean, think about all this

299
00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:57.170
stuff that has to happen.
And you're talking about 30

300
00:15:57.170 --> 00:16:01.130
frames, a second high Def
video on the fly, compressed

301
00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:06.410
quad proc machine, a megabit
up. And I'm just pulled

302
00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:09.220
that number out of my
butt. You know, a, a

303
00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:12.140
really great camera. So many
things need to work. I

304
00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:15.230
would understand why they wouldn't
just turn that on and

305
00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:18.230
say, Hey, look, it kind
of halfway works because what

306
00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:19.850
would happen is a bunch
of people would have bad

307
00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:23.540
experiences. And then people would
say, yeah, HD chat. Doesn't

308
00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:25.910
really, it doesn't really work.
There's a lot of stuff

309
00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:27.560
that has to happen to
it, to make that work.

310
00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:31.700
And I'm interested for the
folks that are, that are

311
00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:34.460
international. What do you think
about that? Like for example,

312
00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:36.530
if I turn my camera
over here to this side,

313
00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:40.250
we've got the, the Hansel
portal. This portal here is

314
00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:41.840
the one that I have
on all the time talking

315
00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:44.330
to Phil hack. And here's
the camera. I leave that

316
00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:47.420
running all day long. Is
that terribly wasteful? Do people

317
00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:50.930
from overseas who have bandwidth
issues, are you bandwidth challenged?

318
00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:52.790
Do you think of that
as being an incredibly wasteful

319
00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:57.110
thing to do really Damien
does that in Australia. And

320
00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:59.750
do you have unlimited internet?
Because I, you know, I

321
00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:02.840
always have this sense that
unlimited isn't really unlimited. He

322
00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:04.580
says it takes about a
gig of his data plan

323
00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:06.950
a day. That's funny, last
time I was in Australia,

324
00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:08.600
that was at a hotel
and they gave me 50

325
00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:13.850
megabytes, 50 megabytes. And I
was halfway through sinking my

326
00:17:13.850 --> 00:17:15.710
inbox when I ran out
of that and then was

327
00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:18.590
kicked out of the hotel.
Yes. It's a bit, a

328
00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:22.250
bit wasteful to talk to
Phil, but, well, it's not

329
00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:24.700
really wasteful because bandwidth is
like water here. I, I,

330
00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:27.350
I'm very, very lucky. I've
got fiber optic to the

331
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:30.860
house and I pay $50
for 20 megabits up 20

332
00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:33.650
megabits down. Actually my buddy,
John backdoor, if he just

333
00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:37.400
went and called a Verizon
files, that's our fiber optic

334
00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:40.400
internet provider here in the
U S and he said,

335
00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:41.950
well, you know, I want
an extra five megabits. So

336
00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:44.960
you paid them $4 more
a month. And now he's

337
00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:49.010
got 25 megabits down. So
if you are in a,

338
00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:52.020
with limited bandwidth and you
are offended by our bandwidth

339
00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:58.650
hogging on behalf of America,
I apologize other cool stuff

340
00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:00.510
that I've got, Oh, speaking
of high Def. So yet

341
00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:02.130
we saw this here in
the life. Cam is really

342
00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:04.500
great because it comes with
the software out of the

343
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.300
box to do high-def videos.
And if you go to

344
00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:09.660
my blog, I actually did
this up on Vimeo. Vimeo

345
00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:12.960
lets you upgrade upload high-def.
And I did a before

346
00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:15.840
and after, but I've talked
about this device before, this

347
00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:19.440
is a great device. This
is the creative Vato, H

348
00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:22.200
D V a D O.
And this is the device

349
00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:24.990
where if you have a
nontechnical friend who doesn't read

350
00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:27.450
a blog, you show them
this and their minds are

351
00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:29.610
blown. And then you say,
and it's only a hundred

352
00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:31.830
bucks and they go, Oh,
and then they immediately think

353
00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:33.780
that you're trying to sell
it to them. This came

354
00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:35.910
up at the windows launch
party yesterday. I showed this

355
00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:38.580
to a few people and
I said, Oh yeah, you

356
00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:40.350
know, I took these videos
that I'm showing you here

357
00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:42.690
on the media center with
this little camera. Oh, where's

358
00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:44.280
the camera. Where's the camera.
They were all expecting me

359
00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:47.100
to come out with a
big Sony, super optical something.

360
00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:48.510
I said, Oh yeah, I
took it on this little,

361
00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:51.960
this little chiclet sized camera
here. And then you bust

362
00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:54.670
out the USB port at
the bottom and then, Oh

363
00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:56.700
my God, it's got USB
built in. And that's the

364
00:18:56.700 --> 00:19:00.310
greatest thing I've ever seen.
This thing is fantastic. Creative

365
00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:03.210
auto HD. I've had the
flip. I had the flip

366
00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:06.120
ultra. I had the flip
Mino. God bless flip. I

367
00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:10.050
sent the flip Mino back.
I like this camera. This

368
00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:13.200
is fantastic. Had a little
bit of codec wonkiness but

369
00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:14.940
the great thing about this
camera is whether you plug

370
00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:16.710
it into a Mac, you
plug it into a PC,

371
00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:19.230
is that the codex built
in? So if you happen

372
00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:20.910
to go to an XP
machine that doesn't have the

373
00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:24.390
right software, this'll install it.
Windows seven plays it all

374
00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:27.450
out of the box. People
are very quiet on Twitter

375
00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:30.000
here, but I appreciate that
Ray Linder has taken the

376
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.040
moment to what to type
in that he is laughing.

377
00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:35.910
And that makes me happy
is the lens glass. That

378
00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:38.280
is a good question. I
don't know. I guess I

379
00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:39.870
could scratch it with a
diamond and then when it

380
00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:44.310
scratches, I'm tapping it and
I don't get a glassy

381
00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:47.550
feel on this particular device.
So I don't think that

382
00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:50.790
the lens is glass on
the creative auto HD, but

383
00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:56.190
remember what the great philosopher
Quintin Tarantino said, he, who

384
00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:58.680
is most likely to make
declarative statements is most likely

385
00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:01.920
to be called a fool.
In retrospect, therefore if I

386
00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:04.440
declare on my show and
lay it down in a

387
00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:07.050
wave file, that this is
not class, we will learn

388
00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:09.930
immediately that it is in
fact glass. So I don't

389
00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:11.910
know. It's the answer to
the question of is the

390
00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:14.370
lens on the creative auto
HD glass. I don't know.

391
00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:18.630
I'm upset. Here's another person
Damian is saying that his

392
00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:21.960
logic life cam pro 9,000.
And in fact, the life

393
00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:25.290
cam pro line thousand from
logic is often considered to

394
00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:29.160
be kind of like the,
the competitor, I guess, for

395
00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:32.430
the, for the life game,
it'll do a nine 60

396
00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:35.760
by seven 20, which interestingly,
isn't true. HD. If you

397
00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:37.650
get in, if you're being
really technical, you want to

398
00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:41.370
have 1280 across, but yes,
it'll work with Skype too.

399
00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:44.190
If you use the Skype
pack, it's not widescreen though.

400
00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:46.350
And that's the thing that's
interesting about this. When I

401
00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:51.190
use the life cam cinema
HD in windows, excuse me,

402
00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:54.970
an office communicator. I actually
see bars across my head.

403
00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:58.330
So I get that 16
by nine. So people with

404
00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:01.630
chat programs that only do
square, ended up getting a

405
00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:04.750
little DVD bar across the
time. So that's crazy. Yup.

406
00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:06.430
See, now Damien's turning around.
There you go with the

407
00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:08.440
declarative statements and he's saying
it does do white screen.

408
00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:10.270
So another option I wanted
to look at is the

409
00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:13.210
logic life camp pro, but
I went and bought a

410
00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:14.950
pile of these. And if
you are a friend or

411
00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:17.290
family, you are going to
get one of these for

412
00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:20.200
Christmas because 50 bucks for
a high definition, camera is

413
00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:25.090
freaking awesome. Hey everybody, this
is Scott coming at you

414
00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:27.700
from another place in time.
No doubt. You probably bump

415
00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:30.700
into testing tasks now, and
then, and your work and,

416
00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:32.980
you know, writing functional tests
is probably not your favorite

417
00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:34.960
thing. It's kind of difficult.
It takes time and the

418
00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:37.840
results can be dubious. Well,
get ready to start liking

419
00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:41.740
tests. Thanks to Tellerik with
the, the new webinar testing

420
00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:45.190
framework. Building web automation test
is a breeze. You've got

421
00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:48.820
code automation with advanced asp.net
Ajax and several light applications.

422
00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:51.430
You can write a single
test, have it executed against

423
00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:54.880
multiple browsers at once. You'd
benefit from a rich API

424
00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:58.420
there's link support integration with
visual studio unit testing, also

425
00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:01.780
in unit X unit and
NBA unit, not to mention

426
00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:04.660
the free rappers for Telerik
rad controls for ESPN and

427
00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:08.200
Ajax and several light, all
shipping with Telerik's new testing

428
00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:11.650
tool. One of the best
features, the webinar testing framework,

429
00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:14.560
which is developed by art
of test is it's absolutely

430
00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:18.580
free Friday got hooked on
web testing framework, start using

431
00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:22.150
it right away. Go to
tellerik.com for more info. Thanks

432
00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:25.060
a lot. What else do
we have around the, the,

433
00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:29.050
the office here? Oh yeah.
Speaking of bandwidth today, I,

434
00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:34.600
I was at a local
bread shop called Panera Panera

435
00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:38.320
sells overpriced sandwiches and then
forces you to sit with

436
00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:42.580
them and surf the internet.
And in fact, they, this

437
00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:46.600
is basically conference room B
for me. So it's like,

438
00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:50.230
Hey Scott, how's it going?
Hey, can I just have

439
00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:52.180
a small soda and sit
here and use your internet

440
00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:55.510
for the next eight hours?
Sure. Scott. Yeah. Yeah. And

441
00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:57.550
then they go over, they
have like a little separate

442
00:22:57.550 --> 00:23:00.730
table for me with a
little cardboard, you know, folded

443
00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:02.680
piece of paper that says
reserved. And then I just

444
00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:05.080
sit there in the back
and suck the internet down

445
00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:08.470
until I finally get nailed
by their Sonic wall firewall.

446
00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:11.050
And they say that I
can't use tiny URL because

447
00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:14.920
it's a naughty site, but
I'm not bitter. So I'm

448
00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:19.270
at Panera this morning and
I'm in the middle of

449
00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:22.390
a call. And then suddenly
I get the Panera captive

450
00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:24.490
portal. So I'm like, I'm
typing, I'm typing. And then

451
00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:27.190
we're doing live meeting. And
then suddenly everything gets switched

452
00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:29.920
over to the Panera CA
captive portal with a nice

453
00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:33.070
big red bold face. Please
limit your session to 30

454
00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:37.750
minutes during the hours, basically
they needed the chair, they

455
00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:41.140
needed the chair. So they
kicked me out. And you

456
00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:43.480
know, you think you're a
geek. My friends, you are

457
00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:45.860
not a geek until you're
sitting in Panera. And this

458
00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:47.660
is going to be a
visual joke because the people

459
00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:50.520
on the, on the Ustream
are gonna appreciate this, but

460
00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:53.350
you're not truly a geek
until you bust it. The

461
00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:58.090
office communicator Vieques 3000 headphones
and you're sitting in a

462
00:23:58.090 --> 00:24:00.490
coffee shop, like you're about
to take off in a

463
00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:04.690
black Hawk helicopter. And you're
having a full screen video

464
00:24:04.690 --> 00:24:06.760
call. And you know how
you're usually like peek over

465
00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:09.340
the shoulder of the guy
in front of you and

466
00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:11.560
Hey, it looks like he's
typing a word document. It

467
00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:15.130
must be doing his, his
dissertation. And I'm the guy

468
00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:17.680
who's like, no, no, I
don't any want more cream

469
00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:20.050
cheese. Hi, I'm on a
live meeting right here. Hello?

470
00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:23.800
Hello. Can you hear me?
Yes. I was wearing headphones.

471
00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:26.020
In fact, I wasn't wearing
these. These are, these are

472
00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:28.810
the, the life cam I
think 3000. These are decent

473
00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:31.570
enough headphones. If you want
to look like a putz,

474
00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:34.690
I'm the one I was
using. There's this little guy

475
00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:37.210
here, which in fact, didn't
you make me look like

476
00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:40.180
a, a black Hawk helicopter
person. This made me look

477
00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:42.070
like the kind of person
who would answer the phone.

478
00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:46.030
If you dial zero, I
had the kind of always

479
00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:49.090
be closing Glen, Gary, Glen
Ross kind of headset here.

480
00:24:49.090 --> 00:24:52.150
Like I was calling for
donations for the local public

481
00:24:52.150 --> 00:24:56.170
broadcasting service. I was wearing
this at, at Panera. So

482
00:24:56.440 --> 00:25:00.100
I got kicked out of
Penn era and well, yeah,

483
00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:02.290
I didn't like actually get
kicked out of Panera, but

484
00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:04.780
effectively when your Mac address
is blocked, you would just

485
00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:07.600
remove yourself from any bad
places that have blocked your

486
00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:10.540
Mac. And then I wandered
around the parking lot, looking

487
00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:14.380
for LyncSys or net gear
or anything at all that

488
00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:19.180
I could do to, to
get some connectivity. And then

489
00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:21.100
I saw one of these
signs on the side of

490
00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:24.650
the road, like a sandwich
board that said clear, I

491
00:25:24.650 --> 00:25:27.130
heard my clear modem go
here. I think he was

492
00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:31.420
on the ground and clear
is a 4g WiMAX service

493
00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:34.180
here. It is that we
have here in the U

494
00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:39.070
S and it's like wifi,
except it's really, really wide

495
00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:43.120
a reach. Like basically my
wifi fits the culdesac in

496
00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:44.380
the house where I live.
So I've kind of got

497
00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:48.340
this cloud. The cloud of
internet is over my house.

498
00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:51.340
These apparently go over. Yes.
Thank you. The dongle is

499
00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:55.360
ugly. The, these go over
about, I think a two

500
00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:58.960
or three mile radius. So
let me hold up the

501
00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:00.850
dongles so that the people
who think it looks ugly

502
00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:03.970
can agree that it is,
it looks ugly. It's actually

503
00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:07.990
a Motorola USB adapter. And
when you look at it

504
00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:11.500
in device manager, it says
like, be mean, or B,

505
00:26:11.530 --> 00:26:15.550
B, B E w E
something, but it's a WiMAX

506
00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:18.610
USB adapter. And then they
give you this strange little

507
00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:23.920
daily and you go like
this and yeah, plug it

508
00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:25.990
in and basically use, I
don't know how to plug

509
00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:29.440
it in. And you get
the little, this is a

510
00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:31.510
really irritating adapter. So we're
going to give you another

511
00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:35.860
adapter that allows you to
kind of like pivot. Yeah.

512
00:26:35.890 --> 00:26:38.620
It's pretty special. So this
is just as I was

513
00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:41.080
looking ugly with my little
headset on now, my computer

514
00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:44.670
can look like crap. Okay.
So the tragedy, you ready

515
00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:47.340
for this? Here's the tragedy.
And this is what happens

516
00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:49.740
when you're an early adopter.
A couple of things happen

517
00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:51.990
for me. One, I go
and I buy this thing

518
00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:53.700
and there's a special deal
at clear right now for

519
00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:56.640
22 bucks a month for
the first six months where

520
00:26:56.640 --> 00:27:00.090
you get unlimited bandwidth. So
that's great, very limited coverage,

521
00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:02.250
but it works all over
Oregon. It took all over

522
00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:05.220
Seattle. So that's great. I'm
thinking, Hey, I'm 90% of

523
00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:06.840
the time I'm in Oregon.
I'm in Seattle. This is

524
00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:09.750
gonna, this is gonna be
fine. And it worked just

525
00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:14.730
fine, but no windows seven
support. So I had to

526
00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:17.310
lie and say, I was
Vista 64 bit. And ordinarily,

527
00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:19.860
I don't feel bad about
that. But the guy gives

528
00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:23.520
me a disc that says
October of 2008. And you

529
00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:27.360
know, the 2008 in internet
years, especially when you're talking

530
00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:32.250
about device drivers is effectively
a decade and no geek

531
00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:34.620
in their right mind would
install anything from October of

532
00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:37.950
2008. So I decided to
go up like the clever

533
00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:41.010
guy that I am, and
I decided to go and

534
00:27:41.010 --> 00:27:43.770
download the new drivers. So
I go, Oh, look that

535
00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:48.690
September, 2009. Aha, I'm so clever.
Well, those drivers totally don't

536
00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:52.440
work with windows seven and
they completely rewrote the little

537
00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:56.280
launcher tool. So long story
short, I ended up installing

538
00:27:56.280 --> 00:28:00.780
the really old drivers from
Vista 64 manually, and then

539
00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:03.210
the really new connector. And
then things worked. Then I

540
00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:06.240
called the highly trained technical
professionals at clear that were

541
00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:08.450
ready to take my call
and help me through my

542
00:28:08.450 --> 00:28:12.440
problem. And immediately when I
mentioned windows seven, they said,

543
00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:14.210
we don't want to talk
to you. We can't tell

544
00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:16.460
you anything. They thought I
was a reporter. I just

545
00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:19.010
wanted them to say, do
you commit to support? I

546
00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:21.890
just wanted to know immediately.
I try to say fizz

547
00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:26.300
bin. They had no idea,
really don't call anywhere and

548
00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:28.370
say, do you know who
I am? I'm Scott Hanselman,

549
00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:31.100
because they will not get
you to second tier support

550
00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:35.780
at all. So this is
the tragedy. This is a

551
00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:39.470
really ugly, stupid dongle that
sits like this. But I

552
00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:43.560
have a lovely, let me
just pick it up. This

553
00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:46.730
isn't picking up my, Oh
my Lenovo here. This is

554
00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:51.440
my in Lenovo w 500.
This is God's own laptop.

555
00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:54.350
He used this on the
seventh day. When he rested,

556
00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:59.810
he was watching hulu.com. This
has a WiMAX system built

557
00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:04.850
into it. According to the
specs. Apparently it's got, yes,

558
00:29:04.850 --> 00:29:07.640
I'm holding it like a
baby. I can we baby.

559
00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:10.580
And apparently the WiMAX is
all around. And it's got

560
00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:12.890
a little icon here that
actually says wide connect or

561
00:29:12.890 --> 00:29:16.550
whatever. I don't have the
drivers for it. I have

562
00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:19.100
no way to understand how
to hook this thing up

563
00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:23.330
and try going into your
local seven 11 or corner

564
00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:26.750
shop or ABC store or
wherever a Reese's pieces and

565
00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:29.090
coffee are sold at seven
in the morning. And try

566
00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:31.580
to explain to the reseller.
They're not the clear guy,

567
00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:34.160
but the guy who's selling
the clear crap from underneath

568
00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:36.650
the thing, the guy who
gets five bucks commission on

569
00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:40.280
my $20 a month and
try saying no, no, no,

570
00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:43.330
I don't want your crappy
USB dongle. I want the

571
00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:46.390
max thingy. That's built into
this. I want the Intel

572
00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:49.180
magic. I don't know how
it works. I don't know

573
00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:51.700
where to plug in an
SD card. I have no

574
00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:53.590
idea how to get Y
max working on this. So

575
00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:56.170
instead I have a thing
sticking out of my machine.

576
00:29:57.040 --> 00:30:00.910
So if anyone within the
sound of my voice has

577
00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:04.030
any idea how to get
the WiMAX magic to work

578
00:30:04.030 --> 00:30:07.660
in here that does not
involve popping open the laptop.

579
00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:12.100
This is great. So EOF
says most w series Lenovo

580
00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:15.370
laptops have antennas for WiMAX.
Thank you, sir. Pop open

581
00:30:15.370 --> 00:30:18.250
the laptop and the card
is fairly visible. Oh, wait,

582
00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:19.960
would you like to tell
me exactly how I'm going

583
00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:23.020
to pop the lab? This
is a $3,000 laptop. Okay.

584
00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:24.490
What am I going to?
I'm just going to get

585
00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:26.450
a butter knife and pop
this open out and tell

586
00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:28.030
me how to do it.
I will do it. I'll

587
00:30:28.030 --> 00:30:29.890
do it here. Live on
the show and I'll rip

588
00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:32.800
the gut screws on the
bottom. Doesn't void the warranty.

589
00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:37.090
Now plastic ruler, people are
now saying to use things

590
00:30:37.090 --> 00:30:40.240
that I don't think are
a good idea. All right,

591
00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:43.750
well, you and me, we'll
take this off offline and

592
00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:45.850
we'll see if we can,
between a screwdriver and a

593
00:30:45.850 --> 00:30:50.500
butter knife, or maybe a
spork. Let's do it. Now.

594
00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:54.370
He's saying it'll have four
to eight screws. That's great.

595
00:30:54.370 --> 00:30:56.290
Four to eight screws. Could
you be a little bit

596
00:30:56.290 --> 00:30:59.680
less specific? There'll be as
many as 12 or as

597
00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:02.290
few as zero screws that
you'll be, have to take

598
00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:05.980
out on the, the Lenovo
PC here. I, I would

599
00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:07.090
very much like to know
how to do that. So

600
00:31:07.090 --> 00:31:08.740
you and I are going
to go offline and we're

601
00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:10.510
going to talk about that
because that would be Epic.

602
00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:12.940
When the next question, of
course, it's going to figure

603
00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:15.700
out who at fifth level
technical support at clear is

604
00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:18.070
going to help me set
this up. But yeah, it

605
00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:19.660
would be awesome if I
didn't have to carry this

606
00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:22.840
around, but then of course
you have a problem, right?

607
00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:26.530
This is portable. I can
plug this into my, my

608
00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:29.560
tiny Dell mini where's my
Dell mini, somewhere around here.

609
00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:31.750
I've got my little tiny
Dell. I can plug this

610
00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:33.400
into a Dominique. It looks
ugly, but then I get

611
00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:36.520
internet everywhere, right? Because isn't
the account married to the

612
00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:39.220
thing it's like married to
the Mac address. So this

613
00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:41.350
is the tragedy of being
an early adopter. It's very,

614
00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:44.860
very unfortunate, but I'm digging
clear. It's been pretty cool

615
00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:47.740
so far and I've enjoyed
myself. You know? So, you

616
00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:50.950
know, other people have said,
why won't I tether? Well,

617
00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:53.920
there's a couple of reasons.
One, I've got an at

618
00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:57.010
and T account. And of
course Microsoft doesn't like iPhone,

619
00:31:57.020 --> 00:32:00.850
so they won't pay for
an iPhone account. So there's

620
00:32:00.850 --> 00:32:03.400
a couple of things. If
you have an iPhone and

621
00:32:03.710 --> 00:32:06.430
you want to tether it,
it's not turned on yet

622
00:32:06.490 --> 00:32:09.700
in the U S and
additionally, its just crappy 3g.

623
00:32:09.730 --> 00:32:11.680
When I say crappy 3g,
I mean at T and

624
00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:16.990
T 3g, which by definition
is crappy. 3g will not

625
00:32:16.990 --> 00:32:21.490
get you very, very fast
speeds. I think the iPhone

626
00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:25.510
original can do 3.6 megabits
per second, max. And we

627
00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:29.200
say 3.6 per second. We're
talking about like on a

628
00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:31.420
magical day where no one
else is on the network

629
00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:34.330
and the sky is blue
and pigs are flying. And

630
00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:37.240
then the iPhone three GS
is a little bit faster

631
00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:41.510
chip and it'll do 7.2
again, only on magical Tuesdays.

632
00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:45.380
However, I was able sitting
on the, on the patio

633
00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:48.620
of Chipotle with the clear
card and I busted out

634
00:32:48.650 --> 00:32:53.780
a solid 6.5 with the
speed test.net and didn't have

635
00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:56.750
to do a thing. So
how big is this? How

636
00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:58.910
big is this? Someone said
this is big. Here's how

637
00:32:58.910 --> 00:33:02.390
big it is. There's my
here's. Here's where you go.

638
00:33:02.450 --> 00:33:05.690
This is just as a
reference. There's my middle finger.

639
00:33:06.410 --> 00:33:08.570
And then it is at
the same size as my

640
00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:11.870
middle finger. I'm not flipping
you off audience, but rather

641
00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:14.690
a T and T who
forced me into this. Now

642
00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:16.340
I have to pay these
guys. The nice thing though,

643
00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:20.360
about clear, no contract. I
like that. No contract. So

644
00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:21.590
I'm gonna try this out
for a couple of months

645
00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:23.990
and see if it's a
good idea. I do not

646
00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:26.420
know. I do not know.
Let's see what else we've

647
00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:28.940
got around the gadget house
here. We've got a bunch

648
00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:31.910
of, this is another old
camera here. How'd you do?

649
00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:38.540
Have you guys been you?
Oh actually this is good

650
00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:41.600
idea. Alright. There it is.
See, I'm looking all over.

651
00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:44.060
Oh, here it is. It's
right on. Like where is

652
00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:45.860
it? It's right in front
of me. Okay. Let's see

653
00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:48.860
if I can pick this
up without breaking anything. This

654
00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:52.070
I blogged about a couple
of days ago. This is

655
00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:57.740
wonderful, magical little thing here.
This is an IMO pivot

656
00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:02.840
within, since my wife's name
is Mo she approves, this

657
00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:08.720
is a little tiny USB
monitor and I have it

658
00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:11.930
sitting in front of my,
my screens and I'm just

659
00:34:11.930 --> 00:34:16.130
actually gonna kind of fire
up Hulu as an example,

660
00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:19.400
Hulu in the U S
is what we use to

661
00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:23.990
piss off the cable industry.
And Hulu is a place

662
00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:26.750
where I can go online
and watch all sorts of

663
00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:32.900
great shows for free. So
there's hulu.com running on my

664
00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:38.240
little screen here and it
works great. 800 by four

665
00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:41.390
80 is the word on
the street with these things.

666
00:34:41.930 --> 00:34:44.030
I can run DVDs off
of it. I can run

667
00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:46.250
a little movies off of
it. I can put Twitter

668
00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:49.040
down here. I can put
you guys down here. Here's

669
00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:51.710
the live streaming video. I'm
just going to look at

670
00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:55.430
that. Move it down into
the, you guys are on

671
00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:58.580
a move you back up
and it's all over USB,

672
00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:02.810
truly magical. When I had
Hulu running the little device

673
00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:05.600
driver that was doing whatever
magic needed to happen to

674
00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:07.700
make this little tiny monitor
work was only using about

675
00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:09.980
three or 4% of the
CPU. And that's an important

676
00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:12.110
thing to point out because
this is not really a

677
00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:15.200
monitor in the sense of
it's not hooked over with

678
00:35:15.410 --> 00:35:19.850
display linker or VGA or
HTMI it's it's, it's just

679
00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:24.020
shoving a ridiculous amount of
information through a USB cable.

680
00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:29.270
Interestingly, it has a little
tiny USB on the back

681
00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:33.110
and then it uses two
connectors on the front. One

682
00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:35.000
of which I believe is
power. And one of which

683
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.190
I, I believe is a,
is the data it's not

684
00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:41.190
a sideshow device? No Microsoft
had this thing in Vista

685
00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:45.540
called a windows sideshow. And
this was the declaration that

686
00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:49.260
all sorts of laptops would
suddenly start using a little

687
00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:52.230
tiny screens that would allow
you to check your email

688
00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:56.250
and allow you to look
at your Twitter on the,

689
00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:59.280
maybe the backside of your
laptop. So you'd close your

690
00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:01.200
laptop and there'd be another
screen on the other side,

691
00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:03.150
or you'd open your laptop
and you'd have a little

692
00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:05.700
monitor pop out the side.
This is not a sideshow

693
00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:09.330
device. This is a full
on actual monitor. So for

694
00:36:09.330 --> 00:36:12.030
example, if I go over
here to my desktop and

695
00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:15.300
I hit personalized to bring
up what my resolution is,

696
00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:19.170
I can take that little
resolution thing here and I'll

697
00:36:19.170 --> 00:36:22.290
just drag it down. And
you can see for those

698
00:36:22.290 --> 00:36:24.900
of you who are not
listening to the tiny, tiny,

699
00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:29.100
tiny monitor, number three down
there, that's this monitor. See

700
00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:30.960
how I actually laid it
out. The way that my,

701
00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:33.630
the end of the physical
layout is there's tiny, tiny

702
00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:37.950
monitor three. And it is
right now, 800 by four

703
00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:40.260
80. I could even make
it my main display if

704
00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:42.720
I wanted to. Yeah, some
of the Dell XPS has

705
00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:44.610
have side shows, but I
don't think sideshow really took

706
00:36:44.610 --> 00:36:47.520
off long Jang. My good
buddy in Australia wants to

707
00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:48.840
know if it could do
portrait and I was gonna

708
00:36:48.850 --> 00:36:49.980
make a little joke and
I was just going to

709
00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:53.430
say, yes, it can and
then just turn it. But

710
00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:56.280
yes, of course it can.
Everything can do portrait in

711
00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:59.730
windows seven because it's part
of the driver process. You

712
00:36:59.730 --> 00:37:01.680
just have to go and
click on orientation and then

713
00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:04.530
you say portrait, it's got
a little thing on the

714
00:37:04.530 --> 00:37:08.010
back here that lets you
hold it up like a

715
00:37:08.010 --> 00:37:11.820
picture frame. And it comes
with this little lovely thing,

716
00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:15.600
which is a little stand
for it and I can

717
00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:17.880
put it on the stand
and then, ah, look at

718
00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:22.260
that. It's pivoting boom. So
yes, it can totally pivot.

719
00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:26.790
It is the greatest $129
that I have spent since

720
00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:31.110
the $129 bottle of insulin
that I bought yesterday. So

721
00:37:31.110 --> 00:37:35.190
yeah, definitely check it out.
That's the IMO pivot and

722
00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:39.330
I blogged about that last
week. It is awesome. I'm

723
00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:42.180
thinking about bringing it with
my Dell mini nine because

724
00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:44.910
I think nothing would be
funnier than a guy with

725
00:37:44.910 --> 00:37:48.990
a little tiny nine inch
laptop. That's what she said

726
00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:52.170
and a little tiny nine
inch monitor next to it.

727
00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:54.810
So, I mean, imagine like
literally being on an airplane

728
00:37:54.990 --> 00:37:58.560
and then busting out the
tiny little pink, you know,

729
00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:00.060
cause every time you pull
out a net book on

730
00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:01.920
a plane, somebody is like,
Oh, I didn't know. They

731
00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:06.240
came that small. That's fantastic.
And then you have, Oh,

732
00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:08.280
well let me bring my
second monitor out. Like we'd

733
00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:10.800
just be on a plane
on a tiny Dell mini

734
00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:14.010
watching a DVD on dual
monitor. That would be freaking

735
00:38:14.610 --> 00:38:18.720
Epic. It's $129. It's fantastic.
What frame rate can you

736
00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:21.780
get? So interestingly, and this
is one of the questions

737
00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:24.600
here that's happening on Ustream
live. Ben Marsh wants to

738
00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:26.370
know what the frame rate
I can get in a

739
00:38:26.370 --> 00:38:28.800
moment I go there. I
just showed Hulu running on

740
00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:31.800
it. It ran fine. I
don't know if it goes

741
00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:33.540
30 frames a second, but
I can tell you that

742
00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:38.410
it's not noticeable. No one
knows that this is a,

743
00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:43.240
you know, not a real
monitor plus if it becomes

744
00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:45.040
a problem and it hasn't
been, but if it becomes

745
00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:46.450
a problem, you can always
right click on that little

746
00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:48.580
trick icon. And they've got
a button here that says

747
00:38:48.970 --> 00:38:53.410
optimize for video. And this
basically says let's have fewer

748
00:38:53.410 --> 00:38:57.700
pixels and get them out
faster. When I did this,

749
00:38:57.940 --> 00:38:59.980
I ended up getting kind
of like not 800 by

750
00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:03.640
four 80, but like, you
know, 400 by two 40.

751
00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:07.480
So basically the, the view
became blockier, but the, the

752
00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:09.970
thing became smoother. But honestly,
with this fast of a

753
00:39:09.970 --> 00:39:12.580
machine with a dual core
machine, I just don't need

754
00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:16.210
to use the optimized five
video feature. I'm using some

755
00:39:16.210 --> 00:39:18.490
release candidate drivers that you
can get up at the

756
00:39:18.490 --> 00:39:22.210
IMO pivot forums and the
only problem that I've had.

757
00:39:22.690 --> 00:39:24.760
And it's, I'm sure it's
because it's a beta thing

758
00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:28.900
is that when my machine
falls asleep, the monitors won't

759
00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:32.620
turn back on, excuse me,
until I unplug the monitor

760
00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:35.890
and then plug it back
in. So that's weird. And

761
00:39:35.890 --> 00:39:38.950
then Damien of course is
providing some, some, some value

762
00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:42.280
here by letting everyone know
that there's some carbon offsets

763
00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:44.110
that I need to purchase
because I'm becoming like the

764
00:39:44.110 --> 00:39:49.960
George Hamilton of the.net, a late
night talk show set. My

765
00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:54.880
skin is, is tanned or
burned or stained blue from

766
00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:58.240
the nits that are kind
of emanating from the multi-monitor

767
00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:01.870
setup that I have here.
Thank you so much. Yeah,

768
00:40:01.870 --> 00:40:03.580
you're really not wanting to
talk. Remember that you're on

769
00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:06.550
a live webcam chat with
me. So I don't think

770
00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:10.300
anyone gets the complaint here.
If people keep saying show

771
00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:14.800
the Kindle DX. So, so
here's the deal. Speaking of

772
00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:19.870
breaking international law, the Kindle
DX that I got to

773
00:40:19.870 --> 00:40:22.870
play with, wasn't actually mine.
I have a Kindle it's

774
00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:25.690
upstairs. The Kindle's fantastic. I'll
talk a lot about the

775
00:40:25.690 --> 00:40:28.030
Kindle if you'd like, but
the Kindle DX was an

776
00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:31.510
interesting trick. A buddy of
mine in Amsterdam desperately wanted

777
00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:34.390
to have a Kendall and
he realized that as a

778
00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:36.640
European, he wouldn't be able
to use it and he

779
00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:40.090
couldn't wait to see whether
or not Amazon would release

780
00:40:40.090 --> 00:40:42.700
a European version. So he
pay, palled me the money.

781
00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:46.330
And then I bought the
Kindle DX and in exchange

782
00:40:46.330 --> 00:40:50.320
for sending it to him,
I would check it out

783
00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:51.700
and try it out for
a couple of weeks. So

784
00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:53.320
I had a, both a
Kindle and a Kindle DX,

785
00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:55.690
and I played with them
for awhile and it's pretty

786
00:40:55.690 --> 00:40:58.600
cool. And then I ended
up mailing it to him

787
00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:01.780
and I think I labeled
the box, use computer parts,

788
00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:03.850
something like that. So he
wouldn't have to pay duty.

789
00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:07.240
And now he's got a
Kendall DX and he uses

790
00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:12.910
it for PDFs works great
for PDFs. The Kindle DX

791
00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:16.900
is fantastic. It's got an
automatic pivot. So when you

792
00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:18.730
pivot, it will pivot as
well, but you can turn

793
00:41:18.730 --> 00:41:20.410
that off, which means that
you can actually lie down

794
00:41:20.410 --> 00:41:22.690
in bed and look at
your PDFs. And they're really,

795
00:41:22.690 --> 00:41:26.380
really clear. Tech technical documents
are not good on a

796
00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:28.750
Kindle too. I've had the
Kindle one and the Kindle

797
00:41:28.750 --> 00:41:32.020
too. And Andrew Tobin here
just asked the question that

798
00:41:32.350 --> 00:41:34.340
I mentioned, tech docs are
not good, but they are

799
00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:36.290
good in the tech on
a DX. The deal is

800
00:41:36.290 --> 00:41:40.190
this. When you have a
PDF on a Kindle DX,

801
00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:42.740
you're looking at like a
four by six screen, maybe

802
00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:45.830
even a little smaller than
four by six, it's tiny.

803
00:41:46.130 --> 00:41:48.890
The bezel, the bezel is
the part of the device

804
00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:52.970
that is not the screen
is really thick on a

805
00:41:52.970 --> 00:41:56.690
Kindle, not thick in the
depth sense, but thick and

806
00:41:56.690 --> 00:42:00.050
the really wide sense like
those chunky monitors. This is

807
00:42:00.050 --> 00:42:02.750
about this monitor is about
the size of a Kindle.

808
00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:05.630
And that big frame on
the outside is about as

809
00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:07.910
much space as you have
between the frame and the

810
00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:10.810
outside of the, the Kindle
itself. It becomes a little

811
00:42:10.810 --> 00:42:13.150
irritating, but it's less important
when you have a Kindle

812
00:42:13.150 --> 00:42:15.880
DX because the Kindle DX
is like 10 inches, large.

813
00:42:16.330 --> 00:42:20.380
It's fantastically huge. So when
you take a PDF and

814
00:42:20.380 --> 00:42:23.380
you put it on a
Kindle DX, you're basically getting

815
00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:26.170
an eight and a half
by 11 or for our

816
00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:30.850
international friends and a four
piece of paper in about

817
00:42:30.850 --> 00:42:34.570
a nine by space, you
know, nine by something space.

818
00:42:34.990 --> 00:42:37.660
So it's like looking at
a small, full piece of

819
00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:40.600
paper. Imagine if you took
an a four sheet of

820
00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:45.010
paper and then photocopied at
about 75, 80%, that's what

821
00:42:45.010 --> 00:42:47.860
it is. It looks like
it looks really good. Remember

822
00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:50.950
though, that the resolution, the
DPI on a Kendall is

823
00:42:50.950 --> 00:42:53.590
insane. If I remember correctly,
it was like 150, 160

824
00:42:54.190 --> 00:42:57.550
a, it's not quite the
300 DPI that you'd expect

825
00:42:57.550 --> 00:42:59.320
from the old laser printers,
but it's definitely to the

826
00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:01.660
point where you don't see
the dots. You cannot see

827
00:43:01.660 --> 00:43:04.480
the dots. Plus the Kendall
DXF remember correctly. Also the

828
00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:06.280
two of that Kindle two
and the kennel DX have

829
00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:09.130
a new E ink screen.
That's used 16 full gray

830
00:43:09.130 --> 00:43:12.580
scales. So photos look fantastic.
So anytime you're going through

831
00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:14.800
a PDF and you see
a photo, you see a

832
00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:17.080
diagram you want to zoom
in on it. They'll just

833
00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:19.600
take that whole thing, rotate
it, zoom in on it,

834
00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:21.130
and you can see it
fill up the entire screen.

835
00:43:21.130 --> 00:43:25.960
Great. So any, any PDF
of reasonable complexity, it would

836
00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:29.440
be fine. I did have
one or two really over

837
00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:31.750
the top, he did PDFs
and I think they had

838
00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:35.800
reviewer options turned on or
something. What kind of super

839
00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:38.680
PDF feature? Sure. You know,
PDF nine or some new

840
00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:41.020
thing. And the Kendall said,
no, I'm sorry. I can't

841
00:43:41.020 --> 00:43:43.750
do that. The problem with
the Kindle. And actually if

842
00:43:43.750 --> 00:43:47.740
you go up and, and
Google with being for, I

843
00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:50.890
think it was Princeton did
an experiment where they were

844
00:43:50.890 --> 00:43:53.350
going to have every student
in their sociology class get

845
00:43:53.350 --> 00:43:55.180
a P a Kindle and
they were going to do

846
00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:57.400
no dead tree books. Everyone
was going to get their

847
00:43:57.400 --> 00:44:00.880
books on a Kindle. And
they, they said no one

848
00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:04.270
wanted to keep the Kindle.
After the end of the

849
00:44:04.270 --> 00:44:07.630
class, it's too slow to
navigate. And it's impossible to

850
00:44:07.630 --> 00:44:10.870
take notes while the Kindle
on paper seems like a

851
00:44:10.870 --> 00:44:15.940
brilliant, brilliant idea for doing,
for doing books for, for

852
00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:19.660
colleges. If you can't take
notes in the margins, then

853
00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:22.630
what can you do? And
that is a huge problem.

854
00:44:22.630 --> 00:44:26.830
And they, they declared it
unacceptable for them unacceptable for,

855
00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:29.980
for Princeton, if I remember
correctly. So if you're a

856
00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:32.850
person who likes to read
and take notes and annotate,

857
00:44:32.850 --> 00:44:35.310
the annotations are a joke.
It's just, it's not going

858
00:44:35.310 --> 00:44:39.150
to happen. But for novels,
for fiction, it is a

859
00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:42.630
joy. The, the, the way
that, you know, as, as

860
00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:44.610
a user of a Kindle,
the way that you know,

861
00:44:44.610 --> 00:44:47.190
that this is going to
be something big is when

862
00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:49.260
you go, w when I
was at the air, I

863
00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:51.000
just happened to me. Actually,
I was at the airport

864
00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:53.790
at a bookstore. I go
into the bookstore and I

865
00:44:53.790 --> 00:44:56.100
see a book. And then
I open up the book

866
00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:57.840
and I read the outside
and I feel the book,

867
00:44:57.840 --> 00:44:59.970
you know, I caressed the
dead tree. And then I

868
00:44:59.970 --> 00:45:01.620
walk out of the bookstore
and I buy the thing

869
00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:06.570
on my Amazon Kendall, right?
I mean, literally Jeff Bezos reached

870
00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:09.630
out of Seattle and into
my pocket and pulled money

871
00:45:09.630 --> 00:45:12.330
out of my account with
the ease of one click.

872
00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:16.860
Right. And boom, suddenly that
I'm watching the next, I'm

873
00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:20.730
reading the next episode of
the very Southern vampire diaries

874
00:45:20.730 --> 00:45:25.530
mysteries, the Sookie Stackhouse novels.
If you must know what,

875
00:45:25.530 --> 00:45:27.180
in fact that I, what
I would, in fact, I'm

876
00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:30.840
reading I'm on book seven
and don't knock it. It's

877
00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:35.490
great stuff and watch true
blood on HBO. So we're

878
00:45:35.490 --> 00:45:37.680
coming to the end of
about a 45 minute show

879
00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:39.960
on Hanselman share. Let's just
have a little five minute

880
00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:42.600
period at the end where
we have open questions on

881
00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:45.720
the Ustream. So start busting
it out. And then I

882
00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:49.170
will would say goodnight to
you guys. I think the

883
00:45:49.170 --> 00:45:52.260
ustream.tv has worked out pretty
well so far. I'll have

884
00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:57.630
a link for this on
the show. It's ustream.tv/channel/handsome and

885
00:45:57.630 --> 00:45:59.880
it's live. But again, all
of this will be set

886
00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:02.460
up at Hanselman it's dot
com. We ended up with

887
00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:08.010
about a total of 196
people who came through the,

888
00:46:08.730 --> 00:46:11.460
the Ustream and right now
60 of them ended up.

889
00:46:11.730 --> 00:46:14.100
So it worked out pretty
good. The only thing I

890
00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:15.660
don't like is that I
can't do the kind of

891
00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:18.390
Larry King where I can push
a button and have someone

892
00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:22.200
talk. I'm going to keep
trying different techniques like this.

893
00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:24.480
And I think maybe, maybe,
maybe once a month, we'll

894
00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:26.730
do a show like this,
and maybe I'll be as

895
00:46:26.730 --> 00:46:29.460
famous as Leo, Leo, Lou,
what's his name? Apparently he's

896
00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:32.640
making a boatload of money
for those of you who

897
00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:34.590
joined late. And those of
you who are listening to

898
00:46:34.590 --> 00:46:39.150
this recorded again, you can
all go up to hanselman.com

899
00:46:39.150 --> 00:46:41.580
or Hansel minutes.com and we'll
have links. And as soon

900
00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:46.800
as I stopped broadcasting the
show, Oh no, I didn't

901
00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:52.590
push start record. Ah, now,
well, it looks like we've

902
00:46:52.590 --> 00:46:56.850
only got audio. That's scary,
crazy. There's I'm looking at

903
00:46:56.850 --> 00:47:00.960
this button here that says
start broadcast, start broadcast. That's

904
00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:03.870
red. Next to it is
a button that says start

905
00:47:03.870 --> 00:47:08.010
record that's green. Or if
you're red, green colorblind, the

906
00:47:08.010 --> 00:47:12.480
two gray buttons on the
right. Good deal. Well, this

907
00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:14.400
has been an episode of
Hansel minutes that has not

908
00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:18.440
been In video. So for
the 57 of you who

909
00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:22.580
have enjoyed this a little
video piece, I think that's

910
00:47:22.580 --> 00:47:25.400
great. Good for you for
the rest of you. You're

911
00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:28.940
listening to Hansel minutes, audio
edition, and there is nothing

912
00:47:28.940 --> 00:47:32.150
else to see. Thanks again.
And I'll see you again

913
00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:37.190
next week. <inaudible>.
