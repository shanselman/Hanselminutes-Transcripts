<inaudible>. Hi, this is Carl Franklin.

13
00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.010
You're listening to Hanselman in
show number eight. Here I

14
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.340
am with Scott again. Hi
Scott. Hello, sir. And what

15
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.920
are we talking about this
week? Well, we're talking about,

16
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.610
just about everything, but right
now I'm thinking about visual

17
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.530
studio ins and things that
add value for free. Okay.

18
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.470
Free is good. I like
free. I like things. There's

19
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.750
lots of applications that I
use where I'm on the

20
00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.640
fifth or sixth 30 day
trial. I want to really

21
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.760
know an application kicks, but
before I pay my hard

22
00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.330
earned money. Okay. So what
do we got today? Well,

23
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.160
the one tool that I'm
excited about, I think I

24
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.520
mentioned in a previous briefly
in the continuous integration talk

25
00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.710
was the, the MSB Microsoft
build Everett environment. Yeah. This

26
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.340
thing is just hot. I
mean, right now, Microsoft really

27
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.950
bringing up two new things
that are adding a lot

28
00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.820
of value to visual studio,
2005. The one that everyone's

29
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.240
talking about of course is
Scott Guthrie's web project. Add

30
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.770
in that we'll cover in
a second, but the one

31
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.560
I think is being kind
of ignored as these ms.

32
00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.480
Build extras. This ms. Build
Everett environment. I think they've

33
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.710
changed it to MSB where
the means extras. Okay. But

34
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.900
it's really the Everett environment.
And this is a thing

35
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.140
that you would, you would
go into your projects and

36
00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.710
add these targets and you'll
be able to build dotnet

37
00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.280
one, one code from within
visual studio, 2005. Oh, that's

38
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.770
great. It's very cool. This
would be a really great

39
00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.760
way to begin moving your
development team over to visual

40
00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.340
studio 2005 and two. Oh,
but you want to continue

41
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.970
to help the customers that
are using.net. One, one, there's

42
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.810
also situations. If you target
1.1, you'll be able to,

43
00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.770
to, to work on all
three versions of, of the

44
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.300
diamond Framework. Whereas if you
just, you know, compile the

45
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.860
two, well, you won't be.
Yeah, exactly. I think that

46
00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.160
we're going to see people
continue to extend environments like

47
00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.280
this. I remember I mentioned
on the continuous integration talk,

48
00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.740
a guy named Carlos Cara,
I think who implemented a

49
00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.800
target for mano. So you
could basically run ms. Build

50
00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.300
and build mano from within
visual studio, 2005. I think

51
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.760
there's an, there's an N
there's going to be an

52
00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.180
unsupported kind of cottage industry
spinning up around ms. Bill.

53
00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.120
There's a lot of really
slick stuff people have been

54
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.900
been coming up with around
EMIS build. Another one is

55
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.180
actually a series of ms.
Build tasks@shrinkstir.com slash C H

56
00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.110
R. And these are basically
tasks that have been added

57
00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:55.350
by the community and put
into a, put into gut.net.

58
00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.590
David yak originally pointed to
this, and it's been posted

59
00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.760
up on Scott Guthrie's site.
I mean, just dozens and

60
00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.000
dozens. I'm just, I'm looking
at this list. Subversion execute

61
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:12.360
VSS, check-in zipping files. XSLTs
creating app pools within IIS,

62
00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.270
sending mail running. I mean,
everything that you'd want. Wow.

63
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.020
That's awesome. Yeah. Very cool
stuff. It's a lot like

64
00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:21.720
the Nant contrib stuff that
we saw where people who

65
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.320
ran the Nant, the NAND
opensource XML based make file

66
00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.740
project a would add things.
And it ended up showing

67
00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.970
up in the Nat contrib
project, but creating those tasks

68
00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.880
somehow it was kind of
hard people didn't didn't make

69
00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.880
as many as I thought.
And ms build though, apparently

70
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.370
these tasks are easier to
make and people have gone

71
00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.300
absolutely bonkers with them. It
looks like it's becoming its

72
00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.720
own little application platform. Yeah,
it really is. It's a

73
00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.390
tiny workflow. Actually. I had
a conversation with some of

74
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:53.820
the, I was talking to
the Microsoft build guys and

75
00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.470
I commented on how the
windows workflow, XML based workflow

76
00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:03.750
manager and the MSB and
ms. Build XML based workflows

77
00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.970
are kind of the same
thing. Like why couldn't ms.

78
00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.840
Build? Yeah. Taking XML, angle
brackets and turning it into

79
00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.110
it's a coding language. Right,
right. It'd be integrated somehow

80
00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.570
with workflow. And they knew
that they said, yeah, we

81
00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.620
can see how there's this,
this imperative XML based programming

82
00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.630
thing that's going on. And
then if you look at

83
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.230
XAML XAML is doing the
same thing. It's attaching angle

84
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:29.070
bracket elements to intent, to
programmer intent. So I think

85
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:30.840
it's kind of ironic. It's
the curse of backup Good

86
00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.720
compatibility. That's what it is.
Yeah. I guess it is.

87
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.330
But it's also that Microsoft
is so big now with

88
00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.140
what is it? 30 or
35,000 folks worldwide that the

89
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:43.170
light bulb gets invented three
times in three different places

90
00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.900
by three different teams. And
that's why you get MSN

91
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.600
messenger and windows messenger. Whichever
one works the best. That's

92
00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.440
the way six different image
editors. Yeah. Yeah. So MSB,

93
00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.040
very cool stuff. Check that
out. Shrinks your.com/c H P

94
00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.960
M and then the web
project stuff. This is a

95
00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.390
really interesting thing. Not just
because of what it does,

96
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:05.540
but because of what it
says is that one Microsoft's

97
00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:09.200
really willing. I think now
to admit that maybe they

98
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.630
didn't realize people were using
their product in this way.

99
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:15.650
And when they removed the
ability in asp.net to Oh,

100
00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:19.040
for a site to have
a project, an actual CS

101
00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.730
project, VB project file, that
kind of was a manifest.

102
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.010
They tossed that. And I
said, Oh no, just point

103
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:28.370
to a directory. And that's
your web project, right. Maybe

104
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:31.640
that was a mistake. And
they're saying that by saying,

105
00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.310
we're not only gonna release
this, this tool, this add

106
00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:37.430
on a series of new
project types, they're going to

107
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.310
give you all of the
behavior you were used to

108
00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:43.700
in visual studio, 2003, but
all the new features in

109
00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.310
2005, like we factoring and
test development in generics and

110
00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:49.190
all that kind of stuff,
and we're going to support

111
00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:52.870
it. That's pretty rock and
sweet. It's pretty awesome. Sort

112
00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:55.750
of an acknowledgement that they,
they sort of said, oops,

113
00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:58.960
you know, we want to
put this back. Yeah. It's

114
00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.790
like, okay, I get it.
You guys, you, you have

115
00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:03.760
said on the blogs very
clearly. We like this. And,

116
00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:05.980
but they're being very cool
about it. They're like, all

117
00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:07.840
right, it's going to be
exactly like this. It's gonna

118
00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:12.610
make life so much easier.
And actually Chris sells@salesbrothers.com just

119
00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:15.460
blogged about this. Recently he
had tried to port sells

120
00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:20.050
brothers.com a very high traffic
site over to asp.net to

121
00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:22.600
Oh, a while back and
basically just got sick of

122
00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.270
it, gave up and, and
was sad. It was sad.

123
00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:28.160
Excuse me. Yeah. Then he
poured it last night in

124
00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.850
an, in a single night
using that, that preview application.

125
00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:32.710
And he said it was
a treat. It should just

126
00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:36.220
worked. That's great. So for
people who are thinking about,

127
00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:39.010
is it time now to
move their 2003 application to

128
00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:43.660
2005, this web application project
makes it so much easier,

129
00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:46.990
much more comfortable builds everything
right into the bin folder,

130
00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:49.030
just like you're used to.
And as he said, it's

131
00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:51.850
free and it's supported. So
there you go. Right now,

132
00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:53.890
it's in beta too. But
when it's finally released, it

133
00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:57.370
will be completely supported. I
think that's very cool. Make

134
00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:58.960
sure you take a look
at the known issues. Of

135
00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.880
course, there are things that
you're doing that might not

136
00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:05.290
be kosher. Okay. So, but
MSB and web project, two

137
00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:06.880
things that you just got
to plug into visual studio,

138
00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.270
2005 Christian wire and the
guys over at think texture.

139
00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:16.600
I've got their contract first
application version 0.6 for dotnet

140
00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.300
two Oh visual studio, 2005.
It's a free download. And

141
00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:25.300
this is fantastic. You build
your wisdom, file yourself, maybe

142
00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:29.590
using XML spy. And when
you bring that into the

143
00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:32.710
visual studio environment, it's not
as rich of an experience

144
00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:35.470
as you would get. When
you do code first, go,

145
00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:37.060
when you write your code
and you Mark it up

146
00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:40.450
with web methods, they are
closing the gap on that

147
00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:43.060
visual studio likes things code
first, right? You make a

148
00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:45.730
file. You say, hello world.
And you visit your ASM

149
00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:48.820
X page question, Mark wisdom
and wisdom gets popped up.

150
00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:52.360
They do the opposite of
that. They really believe that

151
00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:56.130
contract first, the wisdom represents
the contract with their stuff.

152
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:58.620
You can right click on
the wisdom file and they

153
00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:03.240
will generate the proxy stubs,
the server side stub for

154
00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:06.150
you as if you had
run wisdom dot exe from

155
00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:08.750
the command line. So the
idea is you define the,

156
00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:10.550
you define what you want
this thing to do and

157
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:12.170
how you want it to
look. And then it generates

158
00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:15.200
the code. Yeah. You know,
the analogy I usually give

159
00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:17.960
is the, of the Chinese
restaurant. If I were going

160
00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:19.820
to open up a Chinese
restaurant, I can do it

161
00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:23.810
two ways. I could build
a kitchen, put a bunch

162
00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:25.700
of food in the kitchen,
and then I can have

163
00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:28.640
someone run around in the
kitchen. And basically auto-generate my

164
00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:31.760
menu by gleaning from looking
at my kitchen, what I

165
00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:36.110
could potentially sell as a
Chinese restaurant, right. Or I

166
00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:38.930
could build the menu. Right.
I could decide what I

167
00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:42.350
want the public facing kind
of the expression of my

168
00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:46.040
company and my Chinese restaurant,
regardless of what's going on

169
00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:47.930
in the kitchen, there may
be complete chaos going on

170
00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:50.240
in the kitchen. Right. Band-aids
dropped in the food, all

171
00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.640
sorts of nasty stuff. Yeah.
But I don't want that

172
00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:57.440
expressed. That's representing the contract.
You don't typically want people

173
00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:00.710
poking around in your kitchen
to auto-generate the public face.

174
00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:02.810
Right? So a lot of
people who run small businesses

175
00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:05.510
that would really rather that
folks not see how their

176
00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:08.300
businesses run as long as
these two, as long as

177
00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:11.630
the public faces is good.
And contract first is a

178
00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:13.910
really great way to do
that, but there's stuff doesn't

179
00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:17.030
just run whistle that he
see, it's a complete reimagining

180
00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:20.120
of this of wisdom that
I see it'll do strongly

181
00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:24.080
typed collections. It gets rid
of all the nasty details

182
00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:26.330
of wisdom. And the other
really interesting thing is that

183
00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:30.530
if you've already got a
series of schemas, like describing

184
00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:33.920
your messages, your request and
your responses, they'll even, auto-generate

185
00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:37.130
some of the wisdom for
you. So very cool stuff

186
00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:41.000
at a, I think texture
Strongly type collections is even

187
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.890
any kind of collections has
been a problem with web

188
00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:46.400
services. We've always been told
to use a raise. Exactly.

189
00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.050
And the trick is that
as long as it implements,

190
00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:51.560
I list in the correct
way, they'll they'll serialize. Right.

191
00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:54.080
And they handle all that
for you. Yep. Very cool

192
00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:58.490
stuff. Another guy was wondering
how I do the, the

193
00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:02.600
cool code markup on my
blog. I always like my

194
00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:06.140
code to be marked up
with the right colors and

195
00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:08.960
look, look nice, syntax highlighting.
And this is an old,

196
00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.980
an old tool, but, but
a good tool. The copy

197
00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:19.310
source, HTML strength, stir.com/ <inaudible>.
And this is an add

198
00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:21.890
in that will basically add
something to your right click

199
00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:25.310
menu within visual studio. And
instead of just copying your

200
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:28.700
code to the clipboard, it'll
copy, apply a style sheet,

201
00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:32.090
send the whole thing as
HTML to your clipboard. You

202
00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:35.150
can decide to margins and
font, color, font size. Oh,

203
00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:38.270
cool. And then paste it
directly into your blog. And

204
00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:40.100
I use this all the
time. It doesn't necessarily make

205
00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:43.850
pretty XHTML CSS, Wemo, wham,
but it's still pretty sweet.

206
00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:46.370
It's pretty horrible example on
their webpage of colors. And

207
00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:47.900
then if, I guess it's
just to make the point.

208
00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:50.750
Yeah, you can do whatever
you want. I think the

209
00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:54.040
colors on the website are
pretty nasty, horrible, but they're

210
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:56.590
there. The colors that I
pick out of the standard

211
00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:58.990
colors are very cool. Don't
let the nastiness of their

212
00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:01.920
website turn you away. No,
it's just to make the

213
00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.990
point and drive it home
that this can be anything.

214
00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:06.750
Exactly. And this is written
by calling caller and a

215
00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:09.210
very cool stuff. Totally free.
If you're going to be

216
00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:12.600
posting source on your blog,
have a strategy. No one

217
00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:16.500
wants to look at the
poorly formatted, you know, blogs

218
00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:19.350
and you, and that's actually
a larger issue that whether

219
00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:21.510
or not someone reads your
blog and stays at your

220
00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:24.090
blog may not necessarily be
whether your theme is pretty

221
00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:26.310
or your HTML for the
general blog is pretty but

222
00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:30.780
consistent, clean, crisp formatting of
your posts. I think can

223
00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:33.660
tell someone that you're serious
about blogging or not. Right

224
00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:37.920
now you use reflector, right?
Oh yeah. Religiously. Yeah. Reflector

225
00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:40.380
is the bomb. Let's rotor
as a God. I've said

226
00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:43.800
it before. I'll say it
again. But one of the

227
00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:46.470
great things about reflector, other
than the fact that, you

228
00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:48.510
know, you just download it
and it just works and

229
00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:51.150
it updates itself. And it's
the first thing I put

230
00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:54.030
on almost every machine I've
got, that's got.net. Yup. But

231
00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:56.190
also the it supports add
ins. It's got a really

232
00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:59.460
rich add in ability and
people have been just riding

233
00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:03.780
addons all day long. There's
a list of admins@shrinks.com slash

234
00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:07.770
<inaudible>. Wow. Look at that.
I had no idea. These

235
00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:11.580
existed, Check it out. Look
at the reflector. Diff oftentimes

236
00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:13.830
I'll send a DLL off
to QA and they want

237
00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:15.900
to know, well, what's changed.
I can see that the

238
00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:18.060
dates are different. I can
see the version numbers different,

239
00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:20.430
but I really can't let
this go into production unless

240
00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:23.520
I'm sure that just this
one thing has changed. I

241
00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:25.950
thought you'd do a diff
between two binaries at the

242
00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:29.190
ILO level. Oh, that's so
cool. Now the reflector file,

243
00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.650
this assembler. Imagine what you
could do with that. Along

244
00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:35.220
with like MSN search, the
local desktop search or Google

245
00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:39.450
desktop search, you could decompile
the entire dotnet framework into

246
00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:43.560
a folder and then use
the text search tools to

247
00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:47.070
poke around in the quote
unquote source code for the.net

248
00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:50.550
framework. Searching it rather than
using reflector. Wow. Very hot.

249
00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:53.130
The code metrics stuff is
also nice. Not as nice

250
00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:55.860
as the DX core stuff
from code rush, but still

251
00:13:55.860 --> 00:14:00.240
pretty sweet. The tree map
is bizarre. It's a visual

252
00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.130
tree map. Like those ones
that show you how much

253
00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:05.280
space your files and your
hard driver using calm you

254
00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:07.890
are. It looks cool too.
Yeah. And then reflect or

255
00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:12.060
graph fantastic for explaining to
your boss how complicated or

256
00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:14.910
not complicated, your, your dependency
tree of all your different

257
00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:19.320
objects are very cool. Yeah.
Very impressive stuff. There's also

258
00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:22.320
ones that will spit out,
you know, cause reflect, spit

259
00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.150
out different languages. You know
how reflector will let you

260
00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:26.430
say, well, show me, this
is VB. Sure. They've got

261
00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:30.090
ones that'll spit out. Manage
C plus plus or Delphi.

262
00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:34.020
Maybe Mark Miller would like that.
Or iron Python. There's also

263
00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:37.110
one for a language called
BU, which is a very

264
00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:40.440
cool new dotnet language. That's
kind of impressing people. So

265
00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:43.020
take a look at open
running assembly. This one's fantastic.

266
00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:46.140
You can actually open up
an assembly from a running

267
00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:47.850
process. So you don't want
to say, wait a second.

268
00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:50.160
What's in that process. Right?
You were like, see a

269
00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.940
rogue process and you want
to say, I know there's

270
00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:54.290
some dotnet in there. I
want to see what they're

271
00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:57.470
doing. Oh, that's so cool.
Yeah. It'll rip that open

272
00:14:57.470 --> 00:14:59.930
for you. Very cool stuff.
Now, if you look at

273
00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:03.380
open running assembly and you
also use the process Explorer

274
00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:08.000
tool from sysinternals, this is
the replacement from, for task

275
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.250
manager. I didn't know about
that. Where is that? Oh

276
00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:15.230
my goodness. Sysinternals sys internals.
This is Mark Russinovich. These

277
00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:21.020
guys are, they're just gods
they're there. They're just amazing

278
00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:24.290
people. These are the kind
of people where, you know

279
00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:27.290
how other people would meet
like Tom cruise or Jamie

280
00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:29.030
Fox or see them on
the street and stop them.

281
00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:31.910
I would actually stop Russinovich
on the street and say,

282
00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:34.250
dude, I love your work.
I use file Mon by

283
00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:37.910
sysinternals. But so these are
the same guys, obviously. Exactly.

284
00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:40.760
So take a look at
process Explorer. They're on version

285
00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:42.800
10 Oh six. They just
released a new version. This

286
00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:47.300
is a replacement for, for
task manager and I'll use

287
00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:50.480
an old analogy. But the
difference between process Explorer and

288
00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:53.210
task manager is the difference
between shooting a bullet and

289
00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:59.480
throwing it process Explorer is
that much better. Separate CPU,

290
00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:04.520
history, graphs, per process, syntax
highlighting within a process to

291
00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:07.160
tell you whether or not
it's running.net. If you've ever

292
00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:10.280
wanted to search for a
DLL across all running processes,

293
00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:11.810
to see if your DLL
is in the memory of

294
00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:15.980
other processes, wow, I'm shrink
satirized. It shrinks to that

295
00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:18.830
com slash C I ID
that'll take you to process

296
00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:23.810
Explorer. Everything they do is
stunning. Particularly a process. Explorer

297
00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:29.240
is a standout. Also auto
runs, fantastic tool. Auto runs

298
00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:31.850
tells you every single thing
that starts up automatically when

299
00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:34.490
your system boots. And then
one that I put on

300
00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:37.580
every single machine, especially machines
where I can't afford to

301
00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:41.240
buy a disc defragment or
like disc keeper is one

302
00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:46.790
called page defrag, page D
a FRG. This is a

303
00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:52.280
paging tool. The fragger that
will run in that kind

304
00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:55.520
of weird text mode space
right before windows starts up.

305
00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:59.060
Yeah. And it will defrag
your paging file. Wow. The

306
00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:01.070
kind of stuff that you
can't defrag, unless you either

307
00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:04.700
buy a full on D
fragger tool. I put that

308
00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:07.460
on my wife's machine and
also defragments or registry. Oh,

309
00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:09.890
that's awesome. Yeah. It's pretty
hot. Scott. I want to

310
00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:12.410
take a minute here to
remind the listeners that Hansel

311
00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:15.170
minutes would not be possible
without the generous support of

312
00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:18.890
our sponsors. And one of
those sponsors is automated QA.

313
00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:22.040
They make a great product
called test complete, which is

314
00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:25.460
a testing tool that covers
windows apps, web apps, dot

315
00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:28.340
net, framework apps, and job
apps. It's it's a complete

316
00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:31.880
solution. And we'd really like
everybody right now to go

317
00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:36.980
to automated qa.com checkout test
complete and tell them, thanks

318
00:17:36.980 --> 00:18:01.100
for supporting Hansel minutes. I'm
sold. I'm going to spend

319
00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:04.070
All night here tonight. Yeah.
Look, put all that stuff

320
00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:06.320
in your path. It's absolutely
brilliant. Some of the things

321
00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:08.570
that people don't realize about
their stuff, and there's a

322
00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:12.080
couple of articles buried on
their site is that they

323
00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:15.890
want their applications to work
anywhere, anytime on any kind

324
00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:18.770
of machine without having to
do a lot of installations,

325
00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:24.050
turns out that some of
those applications like, like regiment

326
00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:28.100
and file Mon actually unpack
themselves when you run them,

327
00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:32.150
like they have drivers and
things inside they'll they'll notice

328
00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:33.800
what kind of wind, like
what version of windows you're

329
00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:37.850
on. Unpack their driver loaded
up into memory on the

330
00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:40.640
fly run and then undo
it when you close them.

331
00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:43.550
Wow. It's there. It's amazing.
The guys are brilliant. This

332
00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:45.440
was the guy. Of course
it found out the whole

333
00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:50.660
Sony root kit. All right.
Yeah. Fantastic stuff. Great. Let's

334
00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:56.840
move on. Okay. Let's talk
about having multiple versions of.net

335
00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:59.900
on a single machine. A
lot of people complain because

336
00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:04.250
XP pro doesn't let you
have multiple websites. You can

337
00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:07.370
have multiple veeders, but you
can't have, you know, under

338
00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:11.090
IAS administration, you can have
two instances of IAS, each

339
00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:13.880
listing on a different port.
And I get lots of

340
00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:16.160
questions like, well, there's different
hacks that you can do.

341
00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:18.000
And you can poke around
on the registry and, and

342
00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:21.080
force XP pro to do
that. But there will always

343
00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:26.150
be a governor on the
throttling on XP pros, IIS,

344
00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:28.820
and that's just life it's
meant not to want a

345
00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:31.310
website. And I've, even though
I've heard people running with

346
00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:34.460
public websites on XP pro,
well it's meant for development.

347
00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:37.550
So when they ask me
like, don't you hate that

348
00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:39.390
doesn't mean that you, of
a problem with not being

349
00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:42.200
to run multiple websites. I
just run my stuff under

350
00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:45.050
a virtual directory. I try
to write it in such

351
00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:46.700
a way that if I
ever moved it out of

352
00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:49.430
the virtual directory and up
to the root that the

353
00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:52.370
paths that it generates internally
would be, it would be

354
00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:57.260
okay. And I noticed, I
knew this somehow kind of

355
00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:59.180
internally, but I noticed last
week kind of as a

356
00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:03.740
reminder that you can have
of course, multiple versions of.net

357
00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:10.850
running underneath asp.net. And you
can use a tool that,

358
00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:13.880
that asp.net to O installs.
If you right, click on

359
00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:18.110
the properties of your particular
website under IIS, there's an

360
00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:21.320
ASP net tab there that
lets you pick what version

361
00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:26.210
of asp.net and that's for
every site on that particular

362
00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:30.470
site. And interestingly, you'll get
multiple ASP net worker processes

363
00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:33.860
up and you can use
tools like process Explorer. Like

364
00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:37.580
we just talked about tell
which version of.net is running

365
00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:39.860
under, which yeah, because sometimes
you look in the process

366
00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:42.320
in the, you look in
task manager and you can't

367
00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:45.110
really tell, right. It just
gives you the ASP net

368
00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:51.610
worker process. Now you can
use ASP reg eis@thecommandlineinordertoinstalldifferentversionsofhp.net on

369
00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:55.270
a particular Veeder. But using
that visual tools a lot

370
00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:58.210
easier. Now I got myself
in trouble a couple of

371
00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:00.130
days ago when I made
a copy of a website

372
00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:03.220
and just went in and
said, make it asp.net enabled.

373
00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:07.420
And it defaulted to asp.net
to O and I, but

374
00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:09.700
the only symptom I got
was that I couldn't debug.

375
00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:13.120
I would go debug processes
from within visual studio, I'd

376
00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:15.310
pick ASP net worker processing,
I would say, unable to

377
00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:18.100
start debugging. And it was,
it was just pissing me

378
00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:20.590
off. And then I realized
when I hit debug processes,

379
00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:23.770
it was showing me the
path to which version of

380
00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:27.460
ASP net worker process was
there's two versions, right? One

381
00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:29.890
for each version of.net. And
if I just looked at

382
00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:31.720
that text box where it
showed me the path, I

383
00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:34.180
would have noticed that I
was trying from within visual

384
00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:40.390
studio 2003 to debug it
2005 asp.net. Yup. Right there

385
00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:42.040
in your face. Right. Took
me an hour to figure

386
00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:47.260
that out. That happens. You
will never happen again. I'm

387
00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:50.890
now helping people, debug problems
like this. I always seem

388
00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:52.540
to end up getting involved
in that. I'm sure you

389
00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:54.280
do too. Right. I mean,
I'm the it manager for

390
00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:57.250
my whole family, your family,
my mom, my wife, you

391
00:21:57.250 --> 00:21:59.830
know, I mean, if hanselman.com
is down, you know, I've

392
00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:01.270
got cousins that are going
to call me and find

393
00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:04.810
out what the heck's going
on. Right. So a couple

394
00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:07.330
of my, you know, I
usually use the ask for

395
00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:12.520
remote assistance, feature of windows
messenger. Yeah. Chat them. And

396
00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:14.110
then they can room. I
can remote desktop into their

397
00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:17.680
machines, but certainly work firewall
on. Yeah. And that only

398
00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:21.010
works in XP pro. Right.
Right. So I started using

399
00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:24.270
a tool called copilot. Right.
We talked about that on

400
00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:28.590
an earlier show Did and,
and Abdu book, Chris emailed

401
00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:32.070
me back and said, well,
co-pilot's great, but it costs

402
00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:38.730
and cheap fellow that I
am. Abdu pointed me@teamviewer.com, which

403
00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:43.770
appears to be basically the
same thing. No install required.

404
00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:47.730
And it's 500 K freeware
lets you do desktop sharing.

405
00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:50.670
Remote control has some usage
limits. I think you're allowed

406
00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:52.350
to do it for half
an hour before you have

407
00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:56.250
to maybe think about paying
them for licensing, but works

408
00:22:56.250 --> 00:22:58.680
just like VNC and works
behind firewalls. They have a

409
00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:02.340
router basically that will handle
the finding a path to

410
00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:06.600
your remote system. It's free
software, energy PR. Yeah. It's

411
00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:09.510
a very pretty website and
works on any version of

412
00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:13.800
windows, including 2000. And I
think it's the, it's the

413
00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:16.230
kind of thing I might
try on some of my,

414
00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:18.900
my family's web, you know,
computers that are there behind

415
00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:22.050
a firewall where I can't
get the remote desktop stuff

416
00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:24.600
to work when I might
ordinarily have had to pay

417
00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:27.930
10 bucks to copilot. So
very cool stuff. Thank you,

418
00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:32.610
Abdu, for that, that link,
that's a trickster.com/ <inaudible>. I'm

419
00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:34.560
going to have to take
that for a spin. Yeah,

420
00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:36.810
definitely. I'm ready to go
fix something. Now I tell

421
00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:38.460
you not that I don't
want to visit my relatives,

422
00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:41.070
but any opportunity to fix
something remotely is a great

423
00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:43.320
way to get things off
of your, to do list.

424
00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:47.870
Save some time. Yeah. And
actually speaking of lists, I

425
00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:53.460
was checking this out listable
list, IB Ellie, not ABL

426
00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:58.820
e.com <inaudible> dot com slash
C I nine. It's kind

427
00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:03.470
of like, Mmm, delicious like
a social bookmarker. And it's

428
00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:08.150
kind of like digg.com, but
it's basically a list manager.

429
00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:10.370
Like, you know how I've
got my ultimate tools list

430
00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:13.220
except I maintain it. So
it's kind of up to

431
00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:15.920
me and up to the
people to wait for me

432
00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:20.060
to fix lengths, they don't
really, they can say, well,

433
00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:21.560
I like this or I
don't like that, but they

434
00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:25.130
don't get to really collaborate
on a list. Listable is

435
00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:28.670
kind of like delicious, except
things are marked up as

436
00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:31.970
lists. And then people can
add to the list, all

437
00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:35.420
they want and basically vote
resources as the most or

438
00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:39.530
least useful resource in that
list. This is valuable. It

439
00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:42.110
is amazing right there on
the top today, at least

440
00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:45.080
as a windows open source
or free where with a

441
00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:51.490
150 different things that are
all free, fantastic RSS feed

442
00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:55.200
submission sites. Yeah, yeah. Top,
you know, and then they

443
00:24:55.210 --> 00:24:57.040
are then actually ones that
aren't necessarily as interesting, like

444
00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:59.260
top movies of all time
and they're all voting on

445
00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:02.710
these things and sometimes it's
nonsense right now. Buckaroo Buckaroo

446
00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:05.290
Banzai is the number one
movie. I don't know. Monkey

447
00:25:05.290 --> 00:25:08.470
scripts. What's that? Okay. So
grease monkey. Isn't it that's

448
00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:10.390
an extension. I thought they
were talking about a TV

449
00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:13.300
show. No like scripts for
a show called grease monkey.

450
00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:14.860
Got it. Yeah. Yeah. It
wouldn't be a show I

451
00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:19.060
would want to be probably
not. Yeah. But a very

452
00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:23.170
interesting stuff. Top anonymizer sites
sites for letting you browse

453
00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:28.240
anonymously of course, tour being
the top tor.eff.org. There's also

454
00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:30.490
some of the other less
interesting ones, like hide my

455
00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:35.680
ass.com, which is a valuable
thing. If you're searching for

456
00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:38.800
naughty naughty bits at the
hotel, I suppose. Yeah. Not

457
00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:42.370
really. Not something I'm interested
in, but interesting, interesting stuff

458
00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:44.260
that you'll find out there.
The one They take a

459
00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:46.210
lot more than that to
hide my Aspen anyway. Oh

460
00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:50.440
No. When you find these
kinds of a social bookmarking

461
00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:53.980
sites, sometimes interesting stuff rises
to the top. If it

462
00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:56.950
truly is interesting. And that's,
that's one of the benefits

463
00:25:56.950 --> 00:25:59.170
of the mob, the mob
mentality, you know, the mob

464
00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:01.840
can do stupid stuff, right?
And, and you know, we've

465
00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:04.060
seen some of those things
on slash dot, but for

466
00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:06.910
the most part mobs that
are interested in the same

467
00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:10.540
topic can, can make some
interesting things. Listable is a

468
00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:13.330
good place to find links
of interesting stuff, you know,

469
00:26:13.330 --> 00:26:18.310
dig.com didg.com is cool. And
there's an interesting dig clone

470
00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:26.110
specific for.net people called.net, kix.com
shrinks your.com/ <inaudible>. This is

471
00:26:26.110 --> 00:26:29.410
a pretty interesting one. It's
literally a complete clone of

472
00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:34.540
dig written in.net and has
all the kind of stuff

473
00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:36.700
that I think people who
listen to this show and

474
00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:39.100
people who listen to dotnet
rocks should be really interested

475
00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:42.970
in. Yeah. Right now on
dotnet kicks.com. There's an article

476
00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:45.240
on how to use my
SQL the open source database

477
00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:50.010
tool with a with.net, locking
the door behind you. Very

478
00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:52.800
interesting stuff. Some of these
things people have seen before

479
00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:54.900
because they get submitted and
then folks say, Oh, that's

480
00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:57.030
great. That's neat. And they
start moving it up the

481
00:26:57.030 --> 00:27:00.060
list, but does staying on
the homepage. You're definitely gonna

482
00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:03.530
find some interesting stuff. So
we were talking about add

483
00:27:03.530 --> 00:27:07.490
ins here. We, we should
mention DX core. Totally Know,

484
00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:10.550
folks know that I'm a
code rush fan code rush

485
00:27:10.550 --> 00:27:13.220
made by the dev express
guys. And sometimes they say,

486
00:27:13.250 --> 00:27:14.900
Oh, well, code, rush, cost
too much money. I don't

487
00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:17.510
want to spend the money
personally. I think if you're

488
00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:20.150
serious about development and you
find, you find a tool,

489
00:27:20.150 --> 00:27:22.490
whether it be code rush,
or any tool that makes

490
00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:24.470
your life easier, you know,
it's up to you to

491
00:27:24.890 --> 00:27:27.830
give the developers of that
tool money out of respect

492
00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:31.460
for their hard work. But
the code rush folks have

493
00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:38.000
actually made their engine DX
core shrinks.com/cia, available to folks

494
00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.310
to write their own plugins.
Right? I think one of

495
00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:43.160
the most prolific developers of
these plugins, at least the

496
00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:45.800
ones that I use is
Travis Illich, who actually works

497
00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:48.470
at my company. And he's
got a really great plugin

498
00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:53.060
called CR documenter@shrinks.com slash CIA.
This has been seen by

499
00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:55.640
lots of people. This is
a really neat tool. If

500
00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:59.270
you ever use like end
doc to auto-generate your documentation

501
00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:03.080
for your.net assemblies, right? He'll
show a preview window, a

502
00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:07.130
toolbox that integrates entirely with
visual studio, any version of

503
00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:10.310
visual studio, and it will
pop up using the DX

504
00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:13.430
core engine and sit there
and show you a preview

505
00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:17.000
of what your comments will
look like. If they were

506
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.580
generated through indoc. This allows
you to create a lot

507
00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:25.280
of really rich MSDN style
content within visual studio.net, without

508
00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:27.800
having to do the entire
build and do the entire

509
00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:30.710
and doc, I would also
like to add a plug

510
00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:33.200
for DNR TV, which is
one of the other shows

511
00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:36.140
that we produce. This is
a Camtasia show and Mark Miller

512
00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:39.950
was on it. And we
spent over an hour writing

513
00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:43.520
a DX core plugin on
the fly from scratch right

514
00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:47.540
before your eyes. And you
can watch that at shrinks.com/c

515
00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:49.940
I E. So what else
are we going to talk

516
00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:52.550
about today? Well, a couple
of random links of his

517
00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:57.030
interesting things. I think that
folks would dig. Nope, no

518
00:28:57.050 --> 00:29:01.850
pun intended today. First one
is a hidden passage way.com.

519
00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:06.050
This was pretty interesting shrinks
your.com/ <inaudible>. This is a

520
00:29:06.050 --> 00:29:10.340
company that will put a
Batman style, hidden passageway into

521
00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:13.370
your house for you. And
there's serious. What we're talking

522
00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:16.130
about, like pulling back a
book and having a bookshelf

523
00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:21.440
open up, you know, moving
a candlestick, they're basically they

524
00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:25.410
call creative home engineering. So
they'll, they'll, they'll make a

525
00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:30.740
fireplace fold back into a
panic room. Wow. It's, it's

526
00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:33.350
crazy that if you like
things like, you know, like

527
00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:37.310
the make, make magazine or
the make blog is do

528
00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:41.410
it yourself or DIY sites.
Yeah. They'll sell a, do

529
00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:44.080
it yourself kit, where you
can kind of enable your

530
00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:47.830
house for secret secret passageways
and features. Very cool stuff.

531
00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:49.690
Very cool. I don't think
the wife's going to go

532
00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:53.620
for it. We live in
a pretty small, random suburb.

533
00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:55.240
You know, where all the
houses are exactly the same.

534
00:29:56.050 --> 00:29:58.720
I think someone would notice
if I, I don't know,

535
00:29:59.470 --> 00:30:06.220
slipped into a bad cave
in my basement slide. So

536
00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:08.200
another weird thing is I'm
always looking for puzzles and

537
00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:10.360
stuff too, to show to
the wife and waste a

538
00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:12.880
little bit of time at
home. And this one is

539
00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:15.700
a, they call it magic
cube, four D but basically

540
00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:20.770
it's a four dimensional Rubik's
cube. It's not really four

541
00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:24.100
dimensional, but it it's kind
of an analog. It, it

542
00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:27.610
takes a Rubik's cube and
then floats six other Rubik's

543
00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:32.770
cubes themselves around the outside
of the home. You really

544
00:30:32.770 --> 00:30:35.140
have to see it. The
thing that's interesting about it

545
00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:38.620
is that according to their
math and I only got

546
00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:43.330
so far in math, but
apparently the number of positions

547
00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:47.200
that are potential on this
particular Rubik's cube are greater

548
00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:51.070
than the total number of
atoms in the universe. Wow.

549
00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:54.760
So they, they show you
the math and it goes

550
00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:56.590
from like a regular Rubik's
cube. I think it's got

551
00:30:56.590 --> 00:31:00.760
something like 43 gazillion unique
positions. It looks like basically

552
00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:05.880
43 million billion positions. That's the
three directors Rubik's cube. Wow.

553
00:31:06.210 --> 00:31:10.440
Wow. 40 cube has even
more apparently though, even though

554
00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:14.010
it has more permutations, it's
not that hard to solve

555
00:31:14.010 --> 00:31:16.860
if you're already a master
of the three D Rubik's

556
00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:21.570
cube. So I am not
in fact, a master, my

557
00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:24.060
technique for taking apart, the
Rubik's cube is taking apart

558
00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:27.210
the Rubik's cube, putting it
back together again. Alright. What's

559
00:31:27.210 --> 00:31:31.080
next? So yeah. So let
me see. paint.net. You use

560
00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:34.380
that, right? I have, yeah,
it's pretty cool. The 2.6

561
00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:36.930
versions out of beta. I
moved over to Dutton at

562
00:31:36.930 --> 00:31:39.570
two. Oh, What are they
adding now? I mean, you

563
00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:41.730
know, it started out as
just a bare bones paint

564
00:31:41.730 --> 00:31:44.310
app and I can see
it going all the way

565
00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:48.420
to Photoshop. Yeah. It's it's
there. It's got layers. It's

566
00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:51.810
got unlimited history. It's got
more and more special effects,

567
00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:57.360
totally open source. What's new
in the 2.6 version, color

568
00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:02.040
curves, new blending modes, zooming
with the mouse wheel. They

569
00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:04.230
can be deployed now with
active directory. So you could

570
00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:08.160
build this into your corporate
deployment. It's using dotnet to,

571
00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:14.640
Oh, it's wicked fast sweet
internationalization support, gift transparency. I

572
00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:17.100
mean, it's just why this
is not built into Vista.

573
00:32:17.130 --> 00:32:19.770
I just absolutely do not
know. They hired the kid

574
00:32:19.770 --> 00:32:22.710
though. They did the kid
who they hired the kid

575
00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:24.960
who made the thing. I
mean, that's really the way

576
00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:27.600
to get hired now by
Microsoft. Right. You either run

577
00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:30.900
an open source project or
write an incredibly awesome program

578
00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:34.410
that makes windows look really
awesome. Or both or both

579
00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:37.230
like this guy did. Yeah.
Boom, instant job. Now, did

580
00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:40.010
you have a date now?
Here's an total jagged. Did

581
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:42.820
you have a Newton? No,
I never got into the

582
00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:46.150
Newton. No. What was your
first Palm sized object? Believe

583
00:32:46.150 --> 00:32:50.530
it or not. It was
an AIPAC. Ooh. Yeah. I

584
00:32:50.530 --> 00:32:53.410
was all about the Newton.
Yeah, just freaking loved it.

585
00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:56.530
And now there's this project
origami. Have you seen the

586
00:32:56.530 --> 00:32:58.720
marketing for this now? I
haven't seen it at all.

587
00:32:58.750 --> 00:33:02.050
Let's see. I think there's
a project. origami.com. Let me

588
00:33:02.050 --> 00:33:05.710
check that. And this is,
this is basically the first

589
00:33:05.710 --> 00:33:08.920
time that I've seen Microsoft,
not tell people about something

590
00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:15.050
like years beforehand and it's
freaking people out. It's it's,

591
00:33:15.050 --> 00:33:19.000
it's a small hand to
actually it's not project origami.com.

592
00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:22.600
It's, it's a, it appears
to be a small handheld,

593
00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:29.770
not quite a tablet, kind
of possibly a it's it

594
00:33:29.770 --> 00:33:34.600
looks like Microsoft's Newton. Basically.
I'm watching the video here@shrinks.com,

595
00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:37.930
C H O don't really
understand what's going on in

596
00:33:37.930 --> 00:33:47.560
it yet. Scoble here@origamiproject.com is
this mysterious flash application that

597
00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:51.280
has like all of these
self-referential thing. Who am I,

598
00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:53.440
what am I, how will
I make your life easier?

599
00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:58.540
And in that video that
you just described@trickster.com slash Cho,

600
00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:03.100
you see kind of like
happy, attractive people going about

601
00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:06.010
their life, except they've got
this small, not quite tablet

602
00:34:06.010 --> 00:34:08.650
PC in their hands and
they're drawing on it, their

603
00:34:08.650 --> 00:34:11.350
key taking notes, it's the
remote control for their media

604
00:34:11.350 --> 00:34:15.670
center. They're checking their email.
You know, it's like, it's

605
00:34:15.670 --> 00:34:18.370
a, it's a, it's a
small object with screens and,

606
00:34:18.430 --> 00:34:21.400
and a battery and a
tablet that's much, much smaller

607
00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:24.010
than a tablet PC. It
looks kind of like the

608
00:34:24.010 --> 00:34:27.520
OQR remember that. Remember that?
Yeah, sure. It looks kind

609
00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:29.860
of like an Oak, except
the <inaudible> was just trying

610
00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:33.280
to be at a laptop
for people with incredibly small

611
00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:38.140
hands. What, what, you know,
I dunno, what's it? Microsoft

612
00:34:38.140 --> 00:34:41.260
is in the software business.
Are they manufacturing this Hardware?

613
00:34:41.590 --> 00:34:43.570
No, because if you look,
if you poke around on

614
00:34:43.570 --> 00:34:46.240
Google searching for project origami,
there appear to be already

615
00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:50.440
a number of hardware vendors
lined up to make this

616
00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:54.550
stuff. So I, it feels
to me like tiny windows

617
00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:58.120
XP with a different shell.
Yeah. So, I mean, maybe

618
00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:00.160
this, maybe this is another
way to get a tablet

619
00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:03.460
out there. I'm not sure,
but it also seems to

620
00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:06.910
have media center aspects to
it. The, in the video

621
00:35:06.910 --> 00:35:09.040
about halfway through the girl
users, those are remote control,

622
00:35:09.130 --> 00:35:12.610
right? Not sure, but where
do I, where do I

623
00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:15.340
pay? I don't know. I'm
ready, dude. Let's go. It's

624
00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:20.110
still a clandestine project. So
March on March 2nd, it will

625
00:35:20.110 --> 00:35:23.350
be less clandestine. Okay. But
I, we usually, we just

626
00:35:23.350 --> 00:35:26.200
watch end gadget to, for,
for all the details. Right.

627
00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:30.700
Okay. Yeah. It's bizarre. Check
it out. Cool, Scott, before

628
00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:32.940
we wrap it up, you're
going to be talking somewhere

629
00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:35.680
Ghana. Yeah, I'm doing a
poor man's road show. I'll

630
00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:41.490
be in Vancouver on March 6th
next Monday. And I'll be

631
00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:45.630
in Victoria on March 7th. And
I'm gonna be talking about

632
00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:47.670
DAS blog and we're going
to take it apart and

633
00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:50.400
see if there's any useful
code within Dodge blog that

634
00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:52.290
people can use in their
own projects. It's going to

635
00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:55.050
be kind of anatomy of
a blogging engine. Sounds great.

636
00:35:55.610 --> 00:35:57.410
So if you happen to
be in Vancouver next week,

637
00:35:58.190 --> 00:36:00.770
come up and see Scott.
All right. Well, that's a

638
00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:03.230
show, Scott. Thanks a lot
for talking to us and

639
00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:06.050
for the listeners, we'll talk
to you next week on

640
00:36:06.050 --> 00:36:06.680
Hanselman's.
