8
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.050
a weekly discussion with web
developer and technologist Scott Hanselman.

9
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.520
This is Lawrence Ryan announcing the
show number four 84. In

10
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:06.890
this episode, Scott talks with
Michelle Rogers about systems thinking, Hi,

11
00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.170
this is Scott Hanselman. This
is another episode of Hansel

12
00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.680
minutes. And today I'm talking
with Keisha Rogers, she's the

13
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.260
CEO and founder of the
web Smith of web development

14
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.440
company. Thanks for chatting with
me. Thanks for having me,

15
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.250
Scott. I appreciate it. No,
no problem. So we were

16
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.410
talking a little bit earlier
just to kind of prep

17
00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.830
for the show and the
topic for today is about

18
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.590
you. People need to learn
to code there's learned to

19
00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.160
code movement, or is this
the wrong way to go

20
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.080
about things? I think you've
got some really great opinions

21
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.590
about this. Yes, definitely. I'm
here at Webb Smith group.

22
00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.650
We have what we call
a student innovation program and

23
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.740
we do quite a bit
of work with students that

24
00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.000
are entering the technology industry.
And what I found is

25
00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.940
two issues that I'm seeing.
A lot of them know

26
00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.380
how to code where I'm
seeing some challenges is in

27
00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.790
how they think. So we
like to call it systems

28
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.240
based thinking. We spend a
lot of time thinking and

29
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.050
less time coding because we're
seeing people write great code

30
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.900
for the wrong reasons, or
they're writing too much code

31
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.260
and result in bloated code
and systems that you must

32
00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.430
maintain. I think about a
system it's one of those

33
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.670
words. That's just so vague
that there's a certain level

34
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.260
of, of maturity, whether it
be emotional maturity or age,

35
00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.000
or, you know, you have
to go through a certain

36
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.920
amount of school. I tried
it on my seven year

37
00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.450
old. I tried it on
my nine year old. I

38
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.110
tried it on my nephew.
Who's 15. It wasn't until

39
00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.710
I got to my 20
year old niece, that, that

40
00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.160
concept of like, there are
systems and systems have complexity

41
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.130
and workflow that she was
able to kind of grasp

42
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.790
that. Yes, systems is a,
it's such a big word

43
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.470
that, and a lot of
times it's used in different

44
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.710
ways. So when we say
systems, we're thinking about an

45
00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:00.640
interconnected set of methods or
procedures that work together to

46
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.180
accomplish a goal. So that's
what we mean by systems

47
00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:08.890
and, and having coders think
more broad in their code

48
00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.140
and how it fits into
a bigger, larger system. It

49
00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.770
seems also that at least
I have felt that the

50
00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.590
concept of layers of abstraction
and the idea that we're

51
00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.070
standing on the shoulders of
giants has been, I believe,

52
00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.910
largely forgotten with this learn
to code movement. We're teaching

53
00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.740
all these people how to
do a for loop, but

54
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.650
they don't really understand how
the computer works. Yes, yes,

55
00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.590
yes. We're finding a lot
of those particularly. I love

56
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.860
attending the hackathons. I think
it's great. A great practice

57
00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.800
practice. It keeps people on
their toes, but a lot

58
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.840
of what I'm saying, you
know, people are using, you

59
00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.410
know, conditional statements for loops
or res in ways that

60
00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.870
are not needed, but there's
no time for them to

61
00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.600
really think through it. And
so I'd like to see

62
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.850
more, more attention paid to
thinking through an issue. And

63
00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.490
then you have to have
a great vocabulary for code

64
00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.940
to determine if a conditional
statement or a loop or

65
00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.240
some of these other methods
are appropriate for the problem

66
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.900
that you're trying to solve.
Right. I find that some

67
00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.540
of the best interview questions,
aren't the ones that are

68
00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.540
asking you about the detailed
aspects of a language, but

69
00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.170
are things like when you
type google.com and a browser,

70
00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:23.400
describe what happens. Yes. Yes.
That's a lot of that

71
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.740
is lost particularly in the
web industry because there's so

72
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.850
many layers to running a
web or mobile application. We

73
00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.750
have named servers, domain, registrars.
There's so many players that

74
00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.930
play in the, in that
space that can affect your

75
00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.840
web application. And I'm finding
a lot where people are

76
00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.420
focused on their piece of
the equation and where you

77
00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:46.050
find the challenge is when
things start to break. And

78
00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.020
that's when you understand that
people don't understand how things

79
00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.780
work when something breaks and
you can't work your way

80
00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.450
out of it. If it's
not your code, then how

81
00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.400
do you troubleshoot it? How
do you know if it's

82
00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.710
the domain name? It could
be the server. It could

83
00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.990
be, you know, host headers.
It could be a lot

84
00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.530
of different things that could
be wrong. Yes. Yeah. The

85
00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.990
analogy that I've used a
lot with success was that

86
00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:11.250
I was fortunate enough when
I bought my first car.

87
00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.510
It was a $300 car
that my dad wouldn't let

88
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:19.080
me drive it. Cause it
was an automatic, he didn't

89
00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.910
believe two things. He said,
if you're going to have

90
00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.210
a car, even this $300
crap car, you need to

91
00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.460
be able to drive a
manual stick shift, because that's

92
00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.950
important to know the system.
And I won't let you

93
00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:31.350
drive a car until you've
changed the oil once. Yeah.

94
00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.680
Yes, yes, yes. It is
important. And, and using that

95
00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.190
analogy and thinking about code,
I think it's important for

96
00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:43.500
any code or any programmer
to deploy their solution. So,

97
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.690
you know, if they're coding
it, then they should deploy

98
00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.180
it so that they understand
how things work. At least

99
00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.490
from that perspective of deployment,
you learn a lot of

100
00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.820
that in deploying an application,
Right? The idea of being

101
00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.980
the dev ops person, as
opposed to just throwing the

102
00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:59.410
code over the wall. Yeah,
yeah, yeah. Yeah. I've always

103
00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:01.630
felt that people should actually
have a system that they

104
00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:04.240
care about that isn't mission
critical, but it really ought

105
00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.450
to be up 24 hours.
So I've recommended at least

106
00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.460
in the past that you
try to write a blog,

107
00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:13.510
you don't write WordPress, but
write something basic and try

108
00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:15.880
to keep it up, Keep
it up and running. And

109
00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.100
you'd be surprised how much
you have to learn in

110
00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.760
that process. You got to,
and depending on the complexity

111
00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.340
of the blog, you know,
you learn about IP addresses,

112
00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:28.150
a domain name, you're dealing
with the server administrators and

113
00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:31.510
that there's so much that's
involved in keeping a blog

114
00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:34.480
up and running. So one
of the things that I

115
00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.640
appreciated about your perspective on
this is that this idea

116
00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:41.260
of, of patterns, of behaviors,
of evolution, of things over

117
00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.240
time, it seems like a
lot of people don't think

118
00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:47.860
about how processes and systems
evolve over time. Yes. Yes.

119
00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:52.000
One of the biggest lessons
that I've had in my

120
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.520
experience as a developer, I've
been in the industry about

121
00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.890
20 years. And I would
say that one of the

122
00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:00.190
bigger mistakes we've all made
mistakes was in working on

123
00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.040
a project where, you know,
I was simply asked to

124
00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.220
code, you know, let's say
a time sheet, a form.

125
00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:09.880
And you know, just keeping
in that silo. What I

126
00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:13.150
learned was that that form
was actually being used to

127
00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:16.360
populate a payroll system, which
is a mission critical system.

128
00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.970
And there's some questions that
I didn't ask. So this

129
00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:22.720
was like 15 years ago.
And so in thinking about,

130
00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:28.240
systems-based thinking it's really important
to really think about the

131
00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:31.810
bigger picture and how things
evolve and why you were

132
00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:34.870
being asked to develop the
solution that you're asking, who

133
00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:37.000
are the players that are
gonna, that are gonna use

134
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.930
it. How does it impact
other systems around it? Right.

135
00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:43.540
Those things might change the
way you're going to do

136
00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:46.480
validation of your data, how
important it is that your

137
00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:49.210
data is clean. Yes, yes.
Data must be clean on

138
00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:52.720
any system that you're interacting
with. Also it's, it's important

139
00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.930
that those systems have validation
checks and balances as well.

140
00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:59.590
So these are some conversations
that we often don't have

141
00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:02.410
because people often work in
silos. And you're kind of

142
00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:05.890
thinking about your piece of
the puzzle. And that's one

143
00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:09.280
of the challenges in writing
code. It comes in the

144
00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:13.120
backend in maintaining and supporting
the code. You learn that

145
00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:17.080
you didn't ask the question.
And so there's a bottleneck

146
00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:19.780
or something that isn't working
as well as it should.

147
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.650
It seems like in really
complicated systems where I would

148
00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:26.680
not expect to see silos.
I see them. For example,

149
00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:31.180
I often I, when met,
I used Toyota, they're local.

150
00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:32.470
I have a Toyota. So
when I go get the

151
00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:35.920
car oil fixed, I am
shocked at how many systems

152
00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:40.180
do what I call on
the glass integration, where they

153
00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:42.910
have two systems and they
use the clipboard to integrate

154
00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:45.520
those systems. Like you see
this time and time again.

155
00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.370
Yes, yes, yes. Yeah. You
see it over. I mean,

156
00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:50.560
you can see it over
and over their systems that

157
00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:53.530
are in it's popular retail.
I see it a lot

158
00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:58.290
in retail spaces. And again,
that's another example of when

159
00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:01.590
systems are developed in silos,
they often don't work very

160
00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:04.950
seamlessly because you have to
take a step back and

161
00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:08.370
look at not just the
systems themselves, but the connections

162
00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:12.240
between the system so that
everything works very seamlessly. Right.

163
00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:15.080
It seems like people just
in those cases just didn't

164
00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:18.200
think about it. There's some,
yeah. Some chief architect didn't

165
00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:21.140
exist. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I
mean, you know, and it

166
00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:24.140
happens and it's very easy
as you, as you evolve

167
00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:26.990
systems over time, a lot
of times decisions are made

168
00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:30.290
business roles and you kind
of just hack away at

169
00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:33.320
the code over time. And
what ends up happening is

170
00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:36.530
you have bloated code. There
are business rules and embedded

171
00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:39.050
in the code. And as
people come and go and

172
00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:44.150
organizations as teams coming, though,
you have these parts of

173
00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:47.150
code that don't function very
well, that you never learn

174
00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:50.690
about until something breaks. And
then you realize, okay, this

175
00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:53.180
does this no longer fit.
So this is not like

176
00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:57.080
a one time approach that
you would use at the

177
00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.060
beginning of the project. This
is something that should be

178
00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:03.050
ongoing. Yeah. I would think
though, that some people, perhaps

179
00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:04.880
people who are listening to
this show might feel that

180
00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.920
they are just a cog
in the machine. They may

181
00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:09.620
not be the chief architect
so well while they know

182
00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:11.420
they are in a silo
and that they know that

183
00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:13.520
they are building a thing
that flows into another thing,

184
00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:16.100
they may feel they have
no control over that. And

185
00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:17.780
they may not be able
to get involved and make

186
00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:19.610
it better at a larger
scope. Cause that's not simply

187
00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:22.160
not their scope, Their scope.
And I think in a

188
00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.670
lot of larger organizations, it's
pretty easy to, to be

189
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:27.560
able to say that, you
know, I have no control

190
00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:30.980
over it, but my philosophy
is that, you know, in

191
00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:34.460
terms of programming, the job
is not to code the

192
00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:37.670
job is to think. And
so it doesn't require a

193
00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:40.910
lot to ask questions about
things that are gonna impact

194
00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:43.550
whatever it is that you've
been assigned to work on.

195
00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:47.300
I think everyone should take
responsibility for knowing how your

196
00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:51.290
slice of code is impacted
in the organization and how

197
00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:54.110
it impacts other systems around
it so that you can

198
00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:58.310
write better code. And even
it may, the solution may

199
00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:01.250
not even require writing more
code. And that should always

200
00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:03.710
be an option as well.
Yeah. I always like to

201
00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:06.770
be able to refactor via
subtraction. So one of the

202
00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:08.900
things that I'm struggling with
with my kids is for

203
00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:12.290
them to think about things
that they interact with as

204
00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:15.500
part of a larger system.
And I always come, I

205
00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:17.330
want to jokes. I was
making actually this morning with

206
00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:20.030
the kids was a, they
want to toast for breakfast.

207
00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:23.600
So I threatened to make
them take the toaster apart

208
00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:25.160
and put it back together
before I would make any

209
00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:28.280
toast for them. Because from
their perspective, the toaster is

210
00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:32.720
magic. Everything's magic. And I
mean, thinking about, you know,

211
00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:35.930
how we deal with clients,
customers, and colleagues, you know,

212
00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:37.940
it all seems like magic.
You know, you go off,

213
00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:40.310
you write code and you
come back and we hear

214
00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:42.890
the word push buttons a
lot, you know, you kind

215
00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:46.670
of push buttons and it's
really important to understand how

216
00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:48.950
things work and why they
work the way they work.

217
00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:50.960
I have to speak to
my daughter a lot about

218
00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:56.170
like Minecraft uses Minecraft a
lot and plays games. And

219
00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.930
we talk a lot about
how those games were developed.

220
00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:01.600
And what I've learned is
that the more she's interested

221
00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:04.930
in how things were developed
and how they evolved, she

222
00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:08.710
becomes more interested in learning
those things herself. So those

223
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:10.570
are some of the things
that I think are also

224
00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:15.430
appealing to potential technologists that
we're not really focusing on.

225
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:18.610
I find that a lot
of the coding activities are

226
00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:23.110
very mundane, hello world, you
know, things that don't interest

227
00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:25.480
them at all. And I
think that we could tackle

228
00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:28.930
some real world issues and
doing some of these activities.

229
00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:30.790
And I feel like they
would be a lot more

230
00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:34.360
interested in using coding as
a tool to develop solutions.

231
00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:38.490
Right. I feel if people
had a view of how

232
00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:41.130
their silo fit into a
larger system, they would look

233
00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:44.190
at systems like, you know,
if this, then that, but

234
00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:47.370
I have TTT and say,
Oh, you know, I like

235
00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:50.550
Instagram and I like Facebook.
Maybe I can grab, you

236
00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:52.590
know, I can, you know,
if I post to Instagram,

237
00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:55.320
then put the file in
Dropbox and stick it in.

238
00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:59.040
But it seems like there's
a, there's a, a mindset

239
00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:02.490
that that's immediately intuitive to.
Yeah. And then there is

240
00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:04.440
the person who, that isn't
intuitive to, and I'm trying

241
00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:06.630
to figure out how to
make it intuitive to everybody.

242
00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:09.510
Yeah. I think it should
be taught. It's something that

243
00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:11.970
I feel like feel that
should be taught in schools.

244
00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:15.330
And if there are so
many opportunities to teach that

245
00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:18.570
type of thinking in schools,
even in managing homework schedules

246
00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:23.340
and how you return your
homework to teachers, you know,

247
00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:25.590
if I do this by
this date, then I need

248
00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:28.200
to do this next and
this happened. So I think

249
00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:31.410
we could teach that and
how our kids manage just

250
00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:34.380
that our kids have their
own schedules as well. And

251
00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:37.350
when things happen, there are
consequences to those things. So

252
00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:39.990
there are tons of opportunities
to use the, if, then

253
00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:45.060
else types of thinking and
dealing with children. Yeah. It

254
00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:47.430
does seem like I could
making this. This probably is

255
00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:48.690
a thing already, but I
was going to make up

256
00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:51.060
this idea of consequential thinking,
like I'm still trying to

257
00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:53.100
get it across to my
children. Like, you know, they

258
00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:55.140
are, they are young, they
are seven and nine, but

259
00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:58.050
it's like, if you do
this, this is going to

260
00:13:58.050 --> 00:14:00.300
happen. And then five minutes
later, they do it. And

261
00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:04.050
I was like, I literally
told you this was going

262
00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:07.200
to happen. And yeah. Yeah.
There's a, there's a maturity.

263
00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:09.840
There's a, there's a, a
pop that hasn't happened yet.

264
00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:13.260
Yes. Well, some of it
also, I find another thing

265
00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:17.760
that's missing is giving people
permission to break things or

266
00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:22.980
to fail. So some of
teaching consequences is allowing someone

267
00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:26.130
to actually fail so that
they can see the impact

268
00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:29.520
of that consequence. And the
same thing applies to software

269
00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:33.090
development. There are very few
spaces where people can just

270
00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:37.110
fail and, and you know,
that you give people permission

271
00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:39.810
to fail and to break
things and to take things

272
00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:42.930
apart and to see how
things work when you don't

273
00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:47.040
use best practices, for example,
performance, you know, writing bloated

274
00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:50.340
code and the performance over
time. You know, you often

275
00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:52.940
don't have an to see
how that impacts a larger

276
00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:57.160
system until it's in production.
That's a very, very valid

277
00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:01.360
point. I think that that
probably feeds why people feel

278
00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:03.820
here about a lot of
about imposter syndrome and people

279
00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:07.420
feeling like they are in
over their heads because you

280
00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:09.700
know, you do your, you
do your degree or you

281
00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:12.610
do your code camp and
you got a job and

282
00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:15.340
now the pressure's on. Yeah.
But there's no, you don't

283
00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:18.430
really have a flexible open-minded
approach to go and execute

284
00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:20.440
solutions. But I know that
you, you believe that people

285
00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:23.170
should have that flexible approach
They should. And that's how

286
00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:26.440
some people learn best. Actually,
some people learn best just

287
00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:29.740
by doing a and then
they learn from their mistakes

288
00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:32.890
and it sticks more so
than it does when you

289
00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:35.290
kind of teach them and
lecture them. And they take

290
00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:38.410
notes and, you know, a
person could academically know best

291
00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:42.550
practices, but not understand why
they are best practices. So

292
00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:45.520
some people learn better just
by doing and failing and

293
00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:48.610
so creating spaces. And you
know, of course you wouldn't

294
00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:51.940
do this on mission, critical
projects or revenue generating projects,

295
00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:56.530
but creating spaces for people
to actually play around, break

296
00:15:56.530 --> 00:15:59.530
things and test their theories
out, to see why the

297
00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:05.470
best practices are the way
they are. I want to

298
00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:08.500
take a brief moment to
thank my sponsors sync fusion

299
00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:12.520
this week, the first and
only complete Hadoop distribution designed

300
00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:15.970
for windows is now available
from sync fusion. You can

301
00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:19.420
literally deploy a production ready,
big data cluster in minutes.

302
00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:22.570
This revolutionary big data platform
will not only change the

303
00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:25.330
way that you approach big
data, but it is 100%

304
00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:29.650
free for everyone with free
commercial support for sync fusion,

305
00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:36.940
plus members learn more at
sync, fusion.com/big data. I think

306
00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:39.340
that being able to have
that 20% time or that

307
00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:43.240
Friday hackathon where you can
make a chat program for

308
00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:46.060
the, for the office. Yes,
yes, exactly. We might someday

309
00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:48.280
be mission critical, but right
now we're just playing, Just

310
00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:50.800
playing around. Yeah. And we're
actually, we're actually doing a

311
00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:55.000
hackathon here next Tuesday on
an idea that we had

312
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.040
in a meeting and, you
know, with our schedule, we,

313
00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:59.140
that we really didn't have
any time during the business

314
00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:01.630
day. And so we just
decided to carve out some

315
00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:04.540
apps an afternoon, carve out
some time before the holiday

316
00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:07.330
to do a hackathon and
everyone's looking forward to it

317
00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:10.480
because they rarely get a
chance to do that. Hmm.

318
00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:13.330
That's pretty cool. Yeah. And
you're doing that like as

319
00:17:13.330 --> 00:17:14.890
the, as the CEO, as
a founder is like, this

320
00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:18.160
is important. So this is
an organizational value that we

321
00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:21.550
think needs to happen, Please.
Very important. I'm actually participating

322
00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:24.190
in it. I don't often
get a chance to touch

323
00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:27.070
the code these days. So
I actually be helping on

324
00:17:27.070 --> 00:17:29.290
writing some of the code,
but it's an opportunity for

325
00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:31.150
us to learn some new
things and to play around

326
00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:33.430
with some new ideas. Yeah.
I guess if you're going

327
00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:35.260
to like decide as a
company we're going to do

328
00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.600
angular or we're going to
do Ember, do you really

329
00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:39.430
want to do that on
a revenue generating thing the

330
00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:42.100
very first time? Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. You want to, I

331
00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:44.080
mean, you could learn, of
course, you know, could send

332
00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:47.380
people to courseworks and they
can learn, but there's nothing

333
00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:50.400
like actually doing it and
it in the real world.

334
00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:53.400
And you know, when we
create these programs, you know,

335
00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.770
we'll put them in a
pilot phase. Sometimes we'll have

336
00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:58.770
an idea for a community
to use it and we'll

337
00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:01.380
pilot it and see how
it works, works a lot,

338
00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:03.930
just like Google labs. And
some of the other companies

339
00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:06.780
have these labs that they
create these ideas and they

340
00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:09.090
see how they work. Sometimes
they work, sometimes they don't.

341
00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:12.980
Yeah. And now you have
a consultancy. So people are,

342
00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:15.980
I assume, multidisciplinary, you probably
have people that are database

343
00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:18.920
people and people who are
web people. Do you expect

344
00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:20.660
people to know the full
stack? I feel like there's

345
00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:22.220
a lot of talk right
now about, we need to

346
00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:24.680
make full stack developers, but
I don't know about you,

347
00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:26.960
but I feel like there's
a lot more to know

348
00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:29.840
than there was 20 years
ago when I started, There's

349
00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:31.970
a, there's a huge amount
of information to know. And

350
00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:36.200
also things are changing so
rapidly. So, you know, so

351
00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:39.020
as you learn a concept,
there's something new to learn.

352
00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:42.770
So usually I look for
people that know how to

353
00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:46.250
learn new technologies. So I'm
real big on having a

354
00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:50.090
person demonstrate that they can
learn a new technology and

355
00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:52.970
to articulate, how did you
learn that technology? What's your

356
00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:56.420
approach? Everyone has a different
approach. Certainly. I want someone

357
00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:59.840
with a fundamental background. We
tend to work with people

358
00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:03.320
in the computer science area
because they have a fundamental

359
00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:07.250
conceptual background of the computer
sciences. And then to adopt

360
00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:11.810
new technologies is really important.
You know, I tend to

361
00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:15.200
give talks at conferences and
people often assume that I'm

362
00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:18.680
somehow an expert. And I
prefer to, I prefer the

363
00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:24.020
term enthusiastic amateur. I mean,
like I can learn something,

364
00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:26.030
maybe put a week or
two into it and then

365
00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:30.710
present certainly on the one
Oh one said technology. But

366
00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:32.390
unfortunately people will look at
me and say, Oh, wow,

367
00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:34.130
look, how did you become
an expert in that so

368
00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:36.290
quickly? I'm like, no, anyone
should be able to do

369
00:19:36.290 --> 00:19:39.140
that. So when I was
the chief architect at my

370
00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:43.010
last job, we would have
Brown bags and we'd assign

371
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:45.590
technologies and you have to
go and study it and

372
00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:48.530
then come back and talk
about it. And a lot

373
00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:51.140
of people simply the, the,
the, bring it into your

374
00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:56.090
brain process, it make your
analogies and express. It is

375
00:19:56.210 --> 00:19:59.330
almost impossible because I don't
think it's taught, It's not

376
00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:02.600
taught. And also this is
a great approach because teaching

377
00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:05.540
someone a concept is a
good way to learn a

378
00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:09.080
new concept just in having
to teach other people how

379
00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:13.220
to use it. We generally,
we have some of our

380
00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:16.550
developers, of course, they prefer
a front end versus back

381
00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:19.460
end development. And so generally
they work in that space.

382
00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000
I do require that people
know how things work. That's,

383
00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:26.510
that's a fundamental concept that
I want everyone to understand

384
00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:28.880
how things work. We work
in web and mobile space.

385
00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:32.990
So how does the internet
work? You must understand that

386
00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:35.990
in order to work here.
And that's because in thinking

387
00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:40.520
about our operations and how
we support our clients, we

388
00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:43.130
can't support our clients. If
we don't understand how things

389
00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:45.140
work, because when things break,
you must be able to

390
00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:48.880
fix them. When was in
school, we Learned, you know,

391
00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:51.850
fundamentals are TCP IP and
seven layer typology and things

392
00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:55.660
like that. But I don't
know where people learn this

393
00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:59.050
stuff. Like I always thought
it was fun to tell

394
00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:02.950
net into a web server
and see, you know, like

395
00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:06.490
type HTTP ones, lash one
type that yourself at the

396
00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:08.230
command and pretend you are
a web browser. I think

397
00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:11.290
that's like, Oh, that's so
cool. I tried that at

398
00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:13.510
a code camp with some
kids recently. And they thought

399
00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:17.350
that was pretty stupid. It
was like, why are you

400
00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:19.060
talking to the low level
like this? I thought we

401
00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:21.270
were going to learn about
how Instagram works. Yeah, yeah.

402
00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:23.400
You know, because that's the
sexy part. You know, the

403
00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:26.730
stuff you can see, everyone
wants to work there, but

404
00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:30.600
again, you know, allowing people
to go through the process

405
00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:34.860
and to actually experience some
of these challenges, teaches them

406
00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:39.000
why it's important to know
these things. So when apps

407
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.270
and sites go offline, then
it's very important to know

408
00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:44.820
some of these concepts, if
you're going to support those

409
00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:48.720
applications. One of the things
that you said was important,

410
00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:52.350
and I agree is the
idea of diverse teams and

411
00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:57.030
the term diversity is often
used to express color and

412
00:21:57.030 --> 00:22:00.180
gender, but this is about
diversity in thought and diversity

413
00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:04.620
in, in, in roles. Absolutely.
Yeah. Our teams always have

414
00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:07.920
a subject matter expert, which,
you know, it's usually a

415
00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:12.150
non technical person that doesn't
think very technically, but is

416
00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:16.020
an expert on the subject
matter. So there's diversity there.

417
00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:19.350
You know, for example, we
worked on an application that

418
00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:22.470
was related to job postings
and one of the team

419
00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:25.800
members is a human resource
professional. So this person doesn't

420
00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:28.320
have a technical knowledge, but
they understand how people are,

421
00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:31.230
how people are recruited for
employment. And they were an

422
00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:34.260
integral part of that team.
And they were involved from

423
00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:38.160
the start to the finish.
And so teams, diversity and

424
00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:42.660
roles, diversity and divisions, for
example, systems that affect other

425
00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:45.600
systems and having people that
are involved on the other

426
00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:48.630
end of the spectrum to
be involved in the project,

427
00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:52.350
whether it's a customer or
client or another division, there's

428
00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:56.820
a diversity and background. And
that includes racial and ethnic.

429
00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:59.940
And some of these other
gender diversity, these are, it's

430
00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:03.690
really important as we're thinking
about understanding how systems work,

431
00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:07.140
everyone has a different perspective
of how our system works

432
00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:10.440
based on their involvement in
the system. And so that's

433
00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:13.950
why it's important to have
diversity on teams because they

434
00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:17.850
bring a different perspective and
it prevents working in silos

435
00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:20.610
with one types of one
type of thinking, one train

436
00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:26.400
of thought, Right? Even also
in user experience. Yes. If,

437
00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:29.130
if everyone in the team
is the same age, same

438
00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:31.770
gender all looks the same.
They're all going to have

439
00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:36.480
their similar backgrounds coloring, how
they want to interact with

440
00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:39.510
that, that, that product. However,
Yeah. Yeah. It comes up

441
00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:42.990
a lot, particularly in user
interface design, you know, we've,

442
00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:46.100
we've had younger teams work
on projects front end. It

443
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:48.650
looks great. Everyone thinks it
looks great. You present it

444
00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:50.390
to an older team. And
the first thing they say

445
00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:54.530
is I can't read that
you need to increase the

446
00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:56.420
font size. What is this?
I can't read that. I

447
00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:59.240
can't see it. It's too
much information. And so it

448
00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:01.730
comes up a lot in
user interface. The area is

449
00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:05.660
very important to have diversity,
particularly in age. And some

450
00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:09.490
of these other factors. One
of the other things that

451
00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:14.050
I think is interesting is
how troubleshooting and problem solving

452
00:24:14.050 --> 00:24:17.460
has kind of evolved. I
feel like, and I'm, I'm,

453
00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:19.870
I'm dating myself, but I
just feel like I'm getting

454
00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:22.300
a little bit, kind of
get off my lawn, but

455
00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:25.810
you know, it was hard,
you know, troubleshooting was hard

456
00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:28.210
back in the day. And
like, we appreciated a good

457
00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:31.810
like CSI type of a
story where it's like, ah,

458
00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:35.980
I debugged it down to
the protocol layer. A lot

459
00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:37.930
of people seem to assume
that the internet is a

460
00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:40.420
black box and they reach
a certain level and they

461
00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:42.460
just think, Oh, I guess
I can go no farther.

462
00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:44.860
I put, I put that
bite on the wire and

463
00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:50.050
the miracle happened. Yeah, yeah,
yeah. They have troubleshooting. Gosh

464
00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:52.780
is the thing that, you
know, no one wants to

465
00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:55.330
do, but it's the thing
that really makes a breaks

466
00:24:55.420 --> 00:25:00.550
project. And also it's the
area that uncovers when people

467
00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:03.640
don't know how things work,
you see it really in

468
00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:06.940
this area of support and
maintenance, you know, if you've

469
00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:10.660
ever called your cable provider
to try to get support

470
00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:13.450
or your cable service, you
know, a lot of times

471
00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:16.090
you'll, you'll feel it, that
the person that you're on

472
00:25:16.090 --> 00:25:18.700
the phone with ha they
have no idea how the

473
00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:21.580
system works. They cannot help
you. They following a script

474
00:25:22.210 --> 00:25:24.520
and you're not getting anywhere.
And it takes you days.

475
00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:27.520
So in terms of troubleshooting,
you know, we, we like

476
00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:30.370
to start with the basics.
You know, it's basically, you

477
00:25:30.370 --> 00:25:33.310
have to communicate and understand
what the person is trying

478
00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:37.270
to accomplish first. And sometimes
people skip that step. You

479
00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:39.490
know, you'd be amazed at
how people just skip the

480
00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:42.850
step. What exactly are you
trying to do? You know,

481
00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:45.070
we've had scenarios where people
will call and say, I

482
00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:47.260
have a problem with this.
And you find out that

483
00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:49.840
they're not even trying to
accomplish what you think they're

484
00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:52.750
trying to accomplish and had
to ask that question. You

485
00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:55.060
could have just walked them
through it and there's no

486
00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:57.850
code to be touched, but
when you make assumptions and

487
00:25:57.850 --> 00:26:01.900
you don't, you know, follow
a systematic method for troubleshooting,

488
00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:04.540
you know, you could have
a team of 20 engineers,

489
00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:06.760
you know, working on something
that doesn't need to be

490
00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:09.910
fixed. You know? So this
happens a lot, but using

491
00:26:09.910 --> 00:26:14.050
systematic methods for troubleshooting is
extremely important. It's one of

492
00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:17.800
my, one of my biggest
pet peeves. I actually, Yeah.

493
00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:21.820
Breaking something down a binary,
searching a problem. People don't

494
00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:24.160
think about like, what that
exactly means. The idea like,

495
00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:28.450
well, this happened here and
then, you know, what exactly

496
00:26:28.450 --> 00:26:31.870
what happened next? What happened
next? Yeah. Yeah. And in

497
00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:34.480
terms of thinking about giving
people the space to break

498
00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:37.990
things in terms of troubleshooting,
that's another area where it's,

499
00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:40.090
you know, a good place
where people to kind of

500
00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:44.220
test when this happens, that
happens when this, this decreases,

501
00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:46.380
what happens if I turn
this off, what happens if

502
00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:48.780
I turn this on, would
have happened. If I activate

503
00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:52.020
this feature, how does that
impact things? And as systems

504
00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:54.690
become more complex, you know,
in terms of web and

505
00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:57.900
mobile systems, you know, we
have over 200 types of

506
00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:02.880
hybrid development tools. You have,
you know, the browser compatibility

507
00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:06.360
issues that so many layers
of things that could go

508
00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:09.030
wrong, that it's really important
for people to use systematic

509
00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:13.580
approaches as they're troubleshooting. The,
one of the stories that

510
00:27:14.290 --> 00:27:16.670
troubleshooting story that I was
told was that someone came

511
00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:20.240
into a cell phone or
a mobile phone person, him

512
00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:22.220
into a sales office and
said, I need a bigger

513
00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:24.140
antenna. And they were just
yelling and screaming and they

514
00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:27.080
wanted a bigger antenna and
they would not let that

515
00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:29.650
go. They insisted that there's
a problem and I need

516
00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:32.300
a bigger antenna, but it
turned out that what they

517
00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:37.820
wanted was better perception. And
they ended up leaving with

518
00:27:37.850 --> 00:27:41.030
a cell phone that had
an embedded antennas. There's no

519
00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:44.060
visible antenna at all. Yeah,
yeah, yeah. And you find

520
00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:45.770
that a lot. And that
goes back to you though,

521
00:27:45.770 --> 00:27:48.650
to the point about sometimes
the solution is not writing

522
00:27:48.650 --> 00:27:52.610
more code, you know, another
solution, you know, in terms

523
00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:55.700
of customers coming with, I
need this, could you enhance

524
00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:59.270
the system so that it
does this and not thinking

525
00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:02.300
from a systems perspective, you,
you know, go hammering away

526
00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:06.560
writing code. That's exactly how
we create these bloated systems

527
00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:09.980
is reacting. Every time someone
makes a request instead of

528
00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:13.880
having a conversation regarding the
intent and how this impacts

529
00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:17.930
the larger system. I really
liked the idea that, that

530
00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:22.460
you have creating a safe
place to be Definitely. Yeah.

531
00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:24.620
And it's really important. And
in terms of, you know,

532
00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:26.870
there, there are a lot
of movements around getting more

533
00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:31.370
underrepresented populations and technology. I
think one of the things

534
00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:35.840
that would help in that
area is to, is exposure.

535
00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:38.030
You know, a lot of
times people aren't exposed to

536
00:28:38.030 --> 00:28:42.110
enough technology. And the reason
that exposure's important is, you

537
00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:45.440
know, for people that have
access to technology, it, particularly

538
00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:48.260
at home, they could play
around with things. They break

539
00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:51.740
things, they have hobbies, you
know, they're constantly, they have

540
00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:54.440
side projects. And so it
gives them a space to

541
00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:57.560
kind of learn through doing,
for folks that are not

542
00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:59.990
as exposed. You know, they're
kind of thrown into the

543
00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:02.120
deep end of the pool
and they have to play

544
00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:04.400
catch up. And so that's
why it's very important for

545
00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:06.980
us to create these spaces
for people to break things

546
00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:09.980
so that they can learn
how things work. I was

547
00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:13.580
at the, the maker fair
here in Portland. And one

548
00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:15.770
of the companies here in
Oregon, that's very well known

549
00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:18.830
as the Leatherman group, right.
They make Leatherman tools and

550
00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:20.990
I'm thinking, why is the
Leatherman? Why are they here?

551
00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:23.060
And what they had done
is they went to Goodwill

552
00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:26.570
or thrift store bought a
whole bunch of stuff, DVD

553
00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:29.810
players, just a bunch of
junk. And they gave everyone

554
00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:32.630
a Leatherman tool and they
told all the children to

555
00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:35.720
break these things and take
them apart. So you would

556
00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:38.660
have, you know, ten-year-olds that
had never seen inside of

557
00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:42.010
a CD player, opening them
up and taking them apart

558
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:44.470
with a Leatherman and then
figuring out, I didn't know,

559
00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:46.830
that's how it, you know,
Yeah. You don't, that's how

560
00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:48.960
you learn how things work.
That's how I learned, you

561
00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:51.090
know, how things work around
my house. My husband is

562
00:29:51.090 --> 00:29:53.910
the person that, you know,
does the electronics and hooks

563
00:29:53.910 --> 00:29:56.580
up everything at home when
he's not there. You know,

564
00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:58.590
I just start unplugging things.
I'm like, okay, if I

565
00:29:58.590 --> 00:30:01.620
unplug that car, then that
doesn't work. So let me

566
00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:03.660
plug it back in, let
me see what happens here.

567
00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:06.090
If I push this button.
And that's a lot of

568
00:30:06.090 --> 00:30:07.950
times, that's how things work.
Of course you take it

569
00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:11.010
a step further because you
want to understand the technology

570
00:30:11.010 --> 00:30:13.080
and what, you know, the
little label and what things

571
00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:16.980
are called. But you know,
that's exactly how people learn.

572
00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:21.000
Doesn't it seem like if,
if normal people, if nontechnical

573
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.570
people who, who aren't like
you, and I knew that

574
00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:28.530
troubleshooting was just unplugging stuff
and thinking and thinking like,

575
00:30:28.530 --> 00:30:31.170
they think that there's a,
there's a secret. Every time,

576
00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:34.020
every time I leave the
country for some trip, that's

577
00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:37.020
when something breaks, the internet
will work for a month.

578
00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:39.150
I get on a plane
it's dead the next day.

579
00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:42.690
And my wife will call
me and she say something

580
00:30:42.690 --> 00:30:47.430
in the house is beeping.
I don't know what you

581
00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:49.440
want me to do about
that. And then she says,

582
00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:51.990
well, how do I fix
it? And then I'm literally

583
00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:56.670
explaining to her, well, go
into each room and listen,

584
00:30:56.670 --> 00:30:58.320
if you think that thing's
beeping and if you hear

585
00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:02.190
something beeping, unplug it and
see it. Yeah. There's a

586
00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:05.700
magic. This is a woman
with an MBA, but she

587
00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:08.700
just doesn't have the systems
thinking. So she thinks that's

588
00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:11.640
amazing. And that's literally all
we do. That's all trouble

589
00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:14.550
shooting is just start flipping
switches and drawing conclusion. Yeah.

590
00:31:14.550 --> 00:31:16.290
You draw a conclusion to
that. You know, of course

591
00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:19.440
sometimes you draw your conclusions
a little quicker than others

592
00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:22.590
because of your background and
your training, but that's really

593
00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:24.480
what it is, you know,
at home, you know, they

594
00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:26.970
think I'm a genius when
the internet goes down, but

595
00:31:26.970 --> 00:31:29.640
I'm like unplugging the route
or waiting 60 seconds, I

596
00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:31.470
plug it back up and
I'm like, okay, we're good.

597
00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:34.740
And they're like, she fixed
it, you know, but, but

598
00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:37.260
you know, I've learned that
that pattern works and, you

599
00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:39.120
know, I've spoken to, you
have taken it a step

600
00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:41.700
further to understand why, you
know, when they refresh the

601
00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:45.210
IP addresses and everything, how
those things work, but it's

602
00:31:45.210 --> 00:31:48.960
very important. And I'd love
to see more opportunities in

603
00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:52.230
terms of some of these
coding, extra events and hackathons

604
00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:55.140
for people to do a
little more thinking. And there's

605
00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:58.320
an opportunity, you know, from
a community standpoint for these

606
00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:02.040
groups to create community solution
so that you're not just

607
00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:04.800
training people, the right, if
then L statements and to

608
00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:07.650
use a raise and, and
to write loops. But they're

609
00:32:07.650 --> 00:32:11.790
actually thinking about what they're
doing so that they can

610
00:32:11.790 --> 00:32:16.290
write meaningful code. And also
another thought that I had

611
00:32:16.290 --> 00:32:19.950
is to actually have challenges
so that people can figure

612
00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:23.640
out how to write less
code. How can you structure

613
00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:26.340
your code so that there's
less lines of code that

614
00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:29.430
requires a certain level of
thinking as well. And that's

615
00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:32.280
something that, you know, people
don't look into unless you

616
00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:34.980
have a performance issue. And
then people start looking at

617
00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:38.190
the lines of code and
the bloat from that perspective.

618
00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:41.300
But we could teach some
these things earlier. I think

619
00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:45.470
Twitter is a great example
of how, if you have

620
00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:50.150
a great vocabulary, you could
tweet something meaningful and 140

621
00:32:50.150 --> 00:32:53.480
characters and programming could be
the same way. If you

622
00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:56.330
know the programming syntax and
the language you could write

623
00:32:56.330 --> 00:33:00.260
code that doesn't require a
huge number of lines of

624
00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:03.780
code. If you're thinking from
a systems perspective, Right. And

625
00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:08.500
also understanding, understanding the syntax
versus understanding the idioms. Yes.

626
00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:12.580
Like I can make myself
understood in Spanish, but I

627
00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:16.120
don't have idiomatic Spanish. I
can make myself understood in

628
00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:19.000
Ruby, but I am in
no Mo no means by

629
00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.840
no means I, my be
an idiomatic, Ruby developer, mine

630
00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:24.760
would have more lines of
code than isn't it. Yes,

631
00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:27.640
exactly. Exactly. And so that's
important as well. And it's

632
00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:30.880
something you, that's a step
beyond the thinking, but I

633
00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:34.120
think it's something that we
can start to think about

634
00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:38.320
as we're engaging some of
the perspective professionals and technology.

635
00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:41.020
Well, thanks so much for
chatting with me today about

636
00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:44.650
systems. Thank you so much,
Scott. I appreciate it. People

637
