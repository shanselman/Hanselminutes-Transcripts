14
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.600
Hi, this is Carl Franklin and
you're listening to Hansel minutes@hanselminutes.com

15
00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.810
and I'm here with Scott
Hanselman and a very special

16
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.050
guest. Hello Scott. Hi, how
are you, sir? Why don't

17
00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.820
you introduce our guests? We
don't do a lot of

18
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.740
guests here on the show,
of course, but we're very

19
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.840
fortunate to have Gina Trapani
from life. hacker.com. Hi Gina.

20
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.170
Hi, thanks for having me.
We really appreciate you taking

21
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.470
the time. I actually wanted
you to be on the

22
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.730
show because we have some
friends in the publishing industry

23
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.420
and I got a pre-released
copy of your upcoming book

24
00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.240
called a life hacker, ADA
tech tricks to triple charged

25
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.720
your day. Say that three
times fast and, and read

26
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.360
it and just, just loved
it. I, I think I

27
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.700
explained it to my editor
saying that, you know, a

28
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.680
book is good when you
read it and you're jealous

29
00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.200
that you didn't write it
yourself. Thank you so much.

30
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.360
So yeah, I was kinda
bummed you, you beat me

31
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.120
to it. I says, ah,
this is a great book.

32
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.920
I need to write that.
It's like, it's just like

33
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.160
a nice short, but very
productive life hacks to, to

34
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.800
make, make everything better about
your life. But Dana, we

35
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.690
did a life hack show
before, and I know that

36
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.480
you listened to that show,
but can you tell us

37
00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.820
a little about the origin
of the term life facts?

38
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.840
Actually, the, the term was
coined by a gentleman named

39
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.110
Danny O'Brien. Who's a technology
journalist who did a presentation

40
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.790
at the tech O'Reilly's ed
tech conference in 2004. And

41
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.850
the name of his session
was, was life hacks, the

42
00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.940
secrets of over prolific alpha
geek. He had pulled like,

43
00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.030
I don't know, a few
dozen of his like easiest

44
00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.250
friends and said how you
guys get your stuff done

45
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.670
every day. And what came
out of the interviews is

46
00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.590
that, you know, as geeks,
I mean, especially programmers, right?

47
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.270
Cause your, your whole job
as a programmer is to

48
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.450
automate something, you know, build
software. That's going to take

49
00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.060
the load off of a
human being. But a lot

50
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.490
of programmers build in these
like kind of embarrassing little

51
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.100
scripts or stupid systems or
shortcuts in their kind of

52
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.120
everyday workflow. So to speed
things up. So his presentation

53
00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.360
Danny's presentation was done in
2004 and I just love

54
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.010
the term. I just love
the term life hack. I

55
00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.100
thought I had all those
little shortcuts and scripts and

56
00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.400
bash scripts and things kind
of set up for myself.

57
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.960
And I love to hear
about what other, what other

58
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.720
people did and how they
ran their lives. You know,

59
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.170
they're, they're kind of like
digitalized. So This isn't just

60
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.630
software, we're talking about Cina,
right? These are any of

61
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.520
the, I mean, like I
saw bookends made out of

62
00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.340
CD cases on your blog,
is it? Yes. Yeah. Well,

63
00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.880
you know, Danny, his original
intention, meaning the original term

64
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.060
sort of referred to mostly
technical things like, you know,

65
00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.960
scripts to, you know, filter
your email or run your,

66
00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.500
you know, to do dot
text file. But the term

67
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.380
kind of has brought, has,
has been broadened and, you

68
00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.320
know, and I've, I've we've
life hacker.com. We've kind of

69
00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.490
broaden it to include lots
of different things like making,

70
00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.520
you know, bookends out of
CD cases or, you know,

71
00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.750
how to, I don't know,
One of the life hacks

72
00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.810
that I've hacked my life
with is this pocket mud,

73
00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.080
right? I mean, it's just
taking a piece of paper

74
00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.420
building up pages and printing
it out and making a

75
00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.130
tiny little book. I mean,
I think I did that

76
00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.590
in seventh grade, but it
seems so much cooler when

77
00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.970
it's a flash app. Let
you know. Absolutely. Absolutely. Oh

78
00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.640
yeah. I mean, Merlin man,
the hipster PDA, which you

79
00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.420
talked about in your last
airlines, the rubber bands, right?

80
00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.830
Index index cards, Sinking to
paper. I do it all

81
00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:52.290
the time. Yeah. I started
working when my Palm pilot

82
00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.080
and my pocket PC and
my Blackberry aren't talking to

83
00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.760
each other, I just say
get a bunch of three

84
00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.990
by five cards and, and
sync to paper. Yep. Absolutely.

85
00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.990
You know, the first, the
first chapter of your book

86
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.130
is called free up mental
Ram. And I understand that

87
00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.670
you're getting things done kind
of convert as well. Yes.

88
00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:14.850
So you're all about David Allen
and his getting things done.

89
00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:16.560
I think we did a
show on getting things done.

90
00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:23.130
Yeah. All hail. And I'm
just, I'm flipping through some

91
00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.530
of the ones that I
liked right here. You have

92
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.200
everything from how to set
up an Apache web server

93
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.040
and make your own Wiki
local Wiki to how to

94
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.650
take great notes. I mean,
this all happens in one

95
00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:36.750
chapter and that's the kind
of give you a taste

96
00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.170
of what the book is.
Like. One of the things

97
00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:43.050
that I noticed that I
actually asked Carl about before

98
00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:44.850
we started the show that
he had was not familiar

99
00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:47.490
with. And I think not
enough people are familiar with

100
00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.300
is this notion of bookmarklets
yeah. Never heard of those.

101
00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.050
What is a bookmarklet and
why do they rock A

102
00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.940
bookmarklet is just, it's basically
a link that you bookmark,

103
00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.790
but the link isn't to
a URL, it's a snippet

104
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:05.750
of JavaScript, which, you know,
X does something on the

105
00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:09.830
page that you're looking at.
So, so for instance, if

106
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.370
you use, are you familiar
with like the delicious bookmark

107
00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:18.460
social bookmarks? Totally. I use
the Firefox extension for delicious.

108
00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.540
The Firefox extension is great
too, but there's a delicious

109
00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:25.030
bookmarklet that you can, you
know, you just drag and

110
00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:27.520
drop to your toolbar, which,
you know, if you're looking

111
00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.590
at a webpage that you
want to add, the delicious,

112
00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:32.080
you just hit the, hit
the bookmarklet and it pops

113
00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.090
up a window, which automatically
lets you do that. So

114
00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:37.300
it's just like a regular
bookmark, but it, it, it

115
00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.660
does a Javascripty things. Yeah.
Is there something like that

116
00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:43.360
for dig too? Because I
noticed in dig, you have

117
00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.450
to, you know, most people
put little icons embedded in

118
00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:50.140
their webpages in order for
the viewers to be able

119
00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:51.670
to add them to dig,
but you can do that

120
00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:54.850
externally too. Oh, absolutely. Yeah.
You can use a bookmark

121
00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:57.430
lot as well. Cool. Yeah,
it seems with bookmarklets you

122
00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:59.470
could like, if I wanted
to write a bookmarklet that

123
00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:04.000
would highlight the word Hanselman
on any page I could

124
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.890
do that. It would be
it's basically you have full

125
00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:09.160
access to the Dom because
the JavaScript training locally, it's

126
00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.230
not a cross site scripting
attack and you can just

127
00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:14.020
click and do whatever you
want to do. Exactly. It

128
00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:16.150
could be search and replace
or extract. You could make

129
00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:19.720
a bookmarklet to make fonts
bigger. Yeah, absolutely. I wrote

130
00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:23.320
a bookmarklet called the lie
detector. M L Y I,

131
00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.570
since I do a lot
of writing, I, one of

132
00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:27.040
the kind of rules and
writing is that you're not

133
00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.350
supposed to use adverbs very
often, which are words that

134
00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:32.410
end in LOI. I wrote
a bookmarklet that actually will

135
00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:35.530
highlight any, any words that
end in LOI on a

136
00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:37.240
page like, like in yellow,
like as if it were

137
00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:40.240
a highlighter and kind of
like, so you know that

138
00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.730
a page isn't written very
well post isn't written very

139
00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:44.200
well. If it lights up
like a Christmas tree, when

140
00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.900
you hit the, you know,
the lie detector bookmarklet so

141
00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:49.420
you can do all kinds
of neat things. Bookmarklets Gina.

142
00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:56.120
Yes. misbehaving.net. That's an awesome
blog name. Yes. It is

143
00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:58.690
one of the other sites
that I contribute to. I

144
00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:03.370
particularly like the quote well-behaved
women seldom make history. I've

145
00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:05.350
seen that on a few
bumper stickers in my town.

146
00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:10.720
Yes. Yeah. That's a fun
site that I, I, I

147
00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.630
work with collaborate with a
few other women in tech.

148
00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:16.630
No, a lot SPF being
a women in tech, a

149
00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:19.300
lot of our listeners and
a lot of techies as

150
00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:23.680
you well know, are, are
men, but, and sometimes people

151
00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:26.020
say, well, women kind of
head towards in the designer

152
00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:28.180
perspective and men head towards
the, you know, the C

153
00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:31.450
plus plus direction as a
woman in tech. Do you

154
00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:34.090
see any kind of, and
I presume you've been doing

155
00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:35.590
this for awhile, you know,
we've kind of all been

156
00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:37.690
doing this for, you know,
10 plus years, 15 years.

157
00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:40.630
Is there a, is there
a change? Is there, is

158
00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:45.190
that a, a fair separation?
You know, I haven't done

159
00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:48.100
any kind of official studies
on this, so I'm just

160
00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:51.010
speaking totally from yeah. From
my just kind of my

161
00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:56.760
opinion, I think in, in
general women, or at least

162
00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:00.660
I'm really focused on how
technology can be useful, like

163
00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:04.470
the place where technology intersects
with your life. Whereas, and

164
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:08.010
again, speaking in very general,
very general terms here, I

165
00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:10.320
think men can get just
sort of really wowed by

166
00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.870
technology just for the sake
of technology, which kind of

167
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:17.430
brings it to, I don't
live to geek to live.

168
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:19.680
And that, that's kind of
my, really my focus with

169
00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.870
life hacker is like, we're
not just going to talk

170
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:24.690
about technology just because it,
you know, just cause it's

171
00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:27.480
cool or like do things
just because you can, you

172
00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.220
do things because like the
whole purpose is that we're

173
00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:31.350
like, we're like humans and
the machines are supposed to

174
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:36.200
help us. It keeps us
warm and cozy. I think,

175
00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:38.030
I think Gina that you
just nailed it though. And

176
00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:40.730
that's actually good because I've
got lists listed down here

177
00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:42.830
to talk about, you have
a kind of an ongoing

178
00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:45.650
column within your site called
geek to live. And I

179
00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:47.930
think you nailed it. I
mean, to speak in general

180
00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:51.680
terms, men live to geek
and women geek to live.

181
00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:54.050
If this isn't making my
life better or the world

182
00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:58.580
better in some substantive way
than it's just being silly,

183
00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:01.460
it's just being mad and
it's, it's a universal remote

184
00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:05.420
control. I'm never gonna use
Chino. What's what's the invisibility

185
00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:10.190
cloak all about, Oh, the
visibility cloak is a, is

186
00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:12.800
a user script that I
wrote for, for grease monkey.

187
00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:16.370
So grease monkey is a
Firefox extension and which re

188
00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:20.420
which can run any JavaScript
on any given webpage, right?

189
00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:22.610
So you have the grease
monkey installed and you say,

190
00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:25.070
ah, I have this user
script that I want to

191
00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:27.890
apply to the following website.
So I wrote this user

192
00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:31.460
grab this grease monkey user
script called invisible invisibility cloak,

193
00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:35.690
which blanks out any websites
that you don't want to

194
00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:38.060
keep yourself from looking at.
Right? So like I'm a

195
00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:40.700
metal filter addict, right? I
can spend hours, especially on

196
00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:43.580
ask Mehta, filter or say
slash dot or say dig.

197
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:45.830
Right. I mean, I can
just, you know, I've got

198
00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:48.290
an article due tomorrow and
like I could spend three

199
00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:50.330
hours just clicking around those
sites. And there are times

200
00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:52.070
that I just need to
strap myself out of the

201
00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:54.050
chair and keep myself away
from any of those, you

202
00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:57.500
know, really kind of time-sucking
sites. So the invisibility cloak,

203
00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:59.480
you can apply it to
the sites that really take

204
00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.490
up a lot of time,
like slicker or metal filter.

205
00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:03.770
And when it's enabled, if
you go to one of

206
00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:05.750
those sites, when you're supposed
to be doing some work,

207
00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:07.970
it blanks out the site
and it pops up a

208
00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:11.360
little alert box that says,
get back to work. They're

209
00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.670
supposed to be working on
something else. So I'm, this

210
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:16.100
is typical Carl here, wouldn't
it be easier just to

211
00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:18.440
get another computer that isn't
connected to the net that

212
00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:21.560
only has word on it.
It would, but most of

213
00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:24.290
them, at least, at least
most of my work requires

214
00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:27.020
that I like look things
up on the internet. So

215
00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:28.280
it's like, I need to
be on the internet. I

216
00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:30.080
just got to stay away
from those sites. I know

217
00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.780
just real, like, you know,
take me. Yeah, totally. I

218
00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:35.840
noticed that one of your
hacks in here about life

219
00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:38.990
specific hacks is don't check
your email in the morning,

220
00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:41.810
get in and take that
first hour. When you sit

221
00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:43.490
down and where you spend,
you know, you sit down

222
00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:45.280
at eight in the morning,
you start checking your email.

223
00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:47.930
Next thing you know, it's
10 30. It's true. Rather

224
00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:50.900
than having that two and
a half hours be disappear

225
00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:54.130
in a fugue just because
you were checking your email,

226
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:57.460
you have that productive sprint.
That's a great tip. It

227
00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:00.730
is. Now there's a tool
that you guys use on

228
00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:02.740
life hacker. And I understand
that you have some, some

229
00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:04.510
other editors who work with
you on the, on the

230
00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:07.990
site. It's not just you,
right? Yes. And this, I

231
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:09.580
can't remember the name of
the tool it's like auto

232
00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:13.620
it or auto Auto hot
key. This is like a,

233
00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:16.980
there's like a whole cult
around auto hot key. What

234
00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:20.010
is the what's the, A
lot of hockey isn't is

235
00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:23.250
an opensource windows scripting tool.
So with that lets you

236
00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:26.760
basically just automate windows tasks.
So you can, you can

237
00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:30.710
program in mouse, clicks, keyboard
presses, you know, and, and

238
00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:33.030
put, you know, it's actually
pretty robust, you know, scripting

239
00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:35.100
language, you can put conditionals
and wide lips and all

240
00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:39.240
that stuff. So, and, and
one of the, so we've

241
00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.310
written a few articles. In
fact, my co-editor Adam is

242
00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:45.000
a, is a big auto
hockey fan. So one of

243
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.380
the things I use out
of hockey for is I

244
00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:49.500
embed snippets of HTML into
each post on life, hacker,

245
00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:52.080
like my byline and, and
that we have a specific,

246
00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:56.580
specific markup for, to include
a link. So I have

247
00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:59.430
little auto, hot key text
snippets that, you know, that

248
00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:03.030
fill in automatically like I'll
type B, B, Y, and

249
00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:06.160
it'll automatically fill in my,
you know, the markup to

250
00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:10.200
show my byline on a
post. I just downloaded his

251
00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:14.370
Adam patches Mauser. It's interesting.
I had a problem with

252
00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:16.380
a mouse not working. I
couldn't quite figure it out.

253
00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:19.710
So I downloaded Mo Mauser
and it basically gives you

254
00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:21.600
a hot key that lets
you then plug the mouse

255
00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:24.270
into the keyboard. So basically
the, the arrow keys or

256
00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:26.460
the certain keys on your
keyboard will control the mouse.

257
00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:29.880
And then from that I
found a, a mouse grid

258
00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:32.520
hack that one of your
readers had done a mouse

259
00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:35.370
grid. Karl is where you
say hot key. And then

260
00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:39.300
the screen chops up into
nine, nine slots. Nice. And

261
00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:40.740
then you hit like seven,
that would be in the

262
00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:43.620
upper left corner. And then
that seven, what used to

263
00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:46.950
be seven, then chops up
into nine and then you

264
00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:49.320
hit seven again and then
that one chocks chops up

265
00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:52.440
into nine. So you basically
in three or four clicks

266
00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:54.930
can select any point on
the screen. So rather than

267
00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:59.340
moving the mouse, you're basically
playing battleship with your screen.

268
00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:03.060
That's all enabled with this
auto hot key when the

269
00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:05.640
other auto hot key things
that just has completely changed

270
00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:11.880
my life as this Wikipedia
auto, correct? Yep. Yep. I

271
00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:15.570
have it running all the
time. I did an actually

272
00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:17.940
one of our, one of
our, one of our readers

273
00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:21.000
did we had, we had,
I had written a post

274
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.740
about how you, if there
are certain words that you

275
00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:24.540
missed all the time, like,
like my name is Gina,

276
00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:26.940
G I N a, I
always type G I a

277
00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:32.040
N when I type my
name dyslexic finger is exactly.

278
00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:34.080
So I made an auto
hockey script that said anytime

279
00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:36.300
that I typed GI a
N you know, change it

280
00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:38.250
automatically to my name. So
then one of our readers

281
00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:41.580
said, Hey, there's this list
of commonly misspelled words on

282
00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:44.790
Wikipedia. And they made, you
know, that the texture replacement

283
00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:49.160
auto hockey script with that
Is a fantastic tool. Carl.

284
00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:51.530
I mean, this is like
the auto-correct stuff built into

285
00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:54.830
word, but it works for
the entire system. We used

286
00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:57.020
to do this with batch
files. You know, we used

287
00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:00.290
to type D I R
T you know, dirt instead

288
00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:03.050
of deer. So he'd make
a dirt batch file that

289
00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:08.810
calls there, parameters backing, like
this has been around forever,

290
00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:12.680
but it's amazing how I
think that there's, there's the

291
00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:15.080
solutions that we're talking about.
And I think this is

292
00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:17.240
all significant, but one of
the things that I think

293
00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:19.250
is important, and I think
you bring up in some

294
00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:22.610
of your, your posts is
that you have to do

295
00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:25.520
a little self analysis, a
little introspection. You have to

296
00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:28.190
know that you have a
problem before you actually come

297
00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:29.570
up with a solution, right?
This is part of the

298
00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:32.390
geek to live perspective, as
opposed to just, Hey, this

299
00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:34.880
is neat. Hey, this is
neat. And it solved a

300
00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:36.710
problem. I mean, I had
to sit down and say,

301
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:40.190
well, I have a problem.
I consistently misspell stuff. You

302
00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:42.740
know what I think why
this appeals to geek? So

303
00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:46.520
well, especially programmers I think
is because I've noticed that

304
00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:50.150
as a programmer to be
really good, you cannot serve

305
00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:54.320
your ego. You know, you
always, you're always questioning whether

306
00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.360
what you're doing is the
right thing or whether it's

307
00:15:56.360 --> 00:16:01.250
the right way. And you
know, somebody like who, an

308
00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:04.160
older person who is trying
to print, you know, a

309
00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:08.030
word doc who doesn't really
have any experience with computers,

310
00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:11.690
there's a lot more frail
in the tech ego, you

311
00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:13.730
know, does, you know, I
do it this way and

312
00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:16.880
it's gonna work just by
kind of thing. You know,

313
00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:21.020
I do my nine key
stroke print, you know, a

314
00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:24.620
sequence because it works. You
have to have, you have

315
00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:26.900
to have flexibility. You have
to be able to say,

316
00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:28.820
this is not a good
way I'm doing this. It

317
00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:31.690
costs me time. It costs
me money. It costs me

318
00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:33.590
minutes. Yeah. So life hack
seemed to me to be

319
00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:36.080
the sort of the, the,
you know, taking it to

320
00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:39.830
its furthest extreme. Okay. So,
you know, you can look

321
00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:42.650
at yourself, you can see,
you know, I I'm deficient

322
00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:44.900
in these areas. What are
some hacks to help me

323
00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:48.890
overcome those things? How many,
this is a lot of

324
00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:50.720
hacks then looking at this
book here, and this just

325
00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:52.820
goes on and on and
on, you've got 300 pages,

326
00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:55.490
like 88 different tips. And
I'm looking at this, trying

327
00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:56.570
to think how many of
these I'm going to be

328
00:16:56.570 --> 00:17:00.230
able to apply to my
day? How many do you

329
00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:02.540
keep in your head? This
is one of the things

330
00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:04.250
that a lot of people
ask me about my tools

331
00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:07.010
list that I keep like,
wow, this is great. You've

332
00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:09.140
got 300 tools listed, but
how many do you really

333
00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:13.360
use? Yeah. You know, I've
used every book, first of

334
00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:15.580
all, is, is their 80
hacks. But it's certainly, it's

335
00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:18.070
very much like a buffet,
you know, go up, you

336
00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:19.930
flip through it, you figure
out what your, what your

337
00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:21.700
issues are and, and, and,
you know, kind of pick

338
00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:23.230
and choose the ones that
are gonna really apply to

339
00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:24.850
you. I mean, like I,
you know, I have two

340
00:17:24.850 --> 00:17:27.610
different kinds of Wiki installations
in the book, for instance.

341
00:17:27.610 --> 00:17:29.560
So you don't necessarily want
to run two different wikis,

342
00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:32.110
but one is much easier
than the other, depending on

343
00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:34.780
sort of your, your skill
level. And, you know, Wiki

344
00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:36.550
might even, might not work
for a lot of people.

345
00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:38.050
I know it wouldn't work
for say, you know, my

346
00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:40.570
sister. So the book is
kind of like, do you

347
00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:42.700
want to pick and choose
the things that I wouldn't

348
00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:45.520
recommend that every single person
use every, you know, every

349
00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:49.080
single in all 88 hacks,
but every single one of

350
00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:50.880
the book I have used
at one point or another,

351
00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:52.650
it really, it really depends
on what kind of projects

352
00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:54.450
I'm working on at the
time. And like, what are

353
00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:57.960
the things that are really
bugging me, but I've definitely

354
00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:00.030
used every, every single one
at one point or another.

355
00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:04.130
Here's a hack for you,
Carl hack, 15 sentence stuff

356
00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:07.610
to death row. Tell me,
tell, tell Carl about death

357
00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:09.140
row and why he needs
to involve that in his

358
00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:13.190
life. That That's where it
is when you're is basically

359
00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:15.200
when you're hanging on to
too much stuff in your

360
00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:18.500
life, whether it's, you know,
tasks on your, to do

361
00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:22.460
list or software installed in
your computer or, you know,

362
00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:25.400
projects that you want to,
you know, thinking about doing,

363
00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:29.030
or just like stuff, magazines
laying around the house, or,

364
00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:33.710
you know, gadgets, even clutter,
clutter. Yeah, exactly. Any stuff

365
00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:35.780
that you doubt about whether
or not you need make

366
00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:38.270
a big box, whether it's
a virtual folder on your,

367
00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:40.970
on your desktop or, or
a physical cardboard box and

368
00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:42.980
your office and dump it
in the box and the

369
00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:45.650
box is death row. That
seems like the first step

370
00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:48.710
in getting things done. Yeah.
It really, it really does.

371
00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:52.190
It really is very similar
to that. But the thing

372
00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:54.290
is with death row, the
death row box is that

373
00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:56.480
you put it aside. And
if you don't think that

374
00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:58.640
you need one of those
things after a certain amount

375
00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:02.090
of time, six weeks or
a month toss it, you

376
00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:04.850
don't need this stuff. It's
basically just, I think that,

377
00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:07.250
you know, we're just bombarded
with so much information. We

378
00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:09.590
have so many tools available
to us, you know, at

379
00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:11.570
all times I think that,
you know, we really have

380
00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:14.000
to be really kind of
harsh editors, you know, in

381
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.680
our lives and be like,
what are the things that

382
00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:17.840
I really need? And the
rest, like, I, if I

383
00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:19.760
don't read that copy of
the new Yorker, like it's

384
00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:23.300
okay. Isn't that funny? That
that's so true though, because

385
00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:25.610
you look, you're looking at
your book, you've got like,

386
00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:27.380
you might have one tip,
that'll go on for 10

387
00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:29.930
pages. But like the death
row tip is two paragraphs,

388
00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:32.120
but that might be the
one that really affects me,

389
00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:34.460
my wife and I walk
around the house. And we

390
00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:37.850
say, if we haven't physically
touched something in two years,

391
00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:40.670
unless it's a picture or
something, you know, truly like,

392
00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:46.430
you know, a memento, we
throw it out, live simpler.

393
00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:48.590
You know, if you it's
great that you've got that

394
00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:51.670
old Nintendo, but if you
haven't touched it in, in

395
00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:56.630
two years, toss it, it's,
it's very cathartic. I really,

396
00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:58.970
I can't say enough about
that. That's, that's the kind

397
00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:01.040
of the essence of, of,
of a life hack, I

398
00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:04.970
think, is doing something, doing
something a little, you might

399
00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:07.160
make it a little more,
a little uncomfortable initially, but

400
00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:08.510
at the end, you're going
to say, wow, that was

401
00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:11.480
very satisfying. Things are better
now on the other side.

402
00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:14.150
Absolutely. And the nice thing
about the death row approach

403
00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:16.160
is that you give yourself
a window of a couple

404
00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:17.960
of months, like, you know,
okay, I'm going to give

405
00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:19.970
myself a little safety net.
You know, if I realize

406
00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:21.260
I'm going to need this
next week, when it comes

407
00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:23.780
out of the box and
I held onto it. Totally,

408
00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:27.350
totally. Now in the interest
of making things better, we've

409
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:29.390
talked about bookmark, let's talk
about life hacks, but I

410
00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:33.290
understand that you're also a
Firefox two Oh, extension developer

411
00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:35.360
and a lot of my
listeners, right. You know, active

412
00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:37.970
X controls and stuff, but
the other than having a

413
00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:40.190
whole lot of extensions installed,
I don't even know what

414
00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:45.740
is inside an XPI extension
Next year is actually a

415
00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:49.330
Firefox extension is an XPI.
But an externally is actually

416
00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:52.240
just a zip file. If
you renamed the XPI to.zip,

417
00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:54.820
you can unzip it with,
you know, WinZip or seven

418
00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:58.360
zip. And so, and it's
just a file that's made

419
00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:03.280
up of other files, JavaScript
and XML Zul, which I'm

420
00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:04.840
actually not sure if even
that's the way you say

421
00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:08.050
it. Cause I've only read
it XUL is the, is

422
00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:12.880
the, is the, is the
structure is the specification that

423
00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:15.370
Firefox uses the plugin to
plug into the browser into

424
00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:18.580
the Chrome. So you really
can download any firefighter extension,

425
00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:21.070
like I said, and unzip
it to take a look

426
00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:23.290
at the innards of it.
And really all it is,

427
00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:28.210
is snippets of JavaScript and
pieces of XML, which say,

428
00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:30.640
add this button to this
tool bar or add this

429
00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:33.790
menu to this, you know,
to this pull down. So

430
00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:35.770
it's really actually very simple.
In fact, when I, when

431
00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:38.470
I first realized that that's
all a Firefox extension was,

432
00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:41.050
I was kind of amazed.
So really, I mean, if

433
00:21:41.050 --> 00:21:43.030
you, if you're a bookmark
with developer or even if

434
00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:44.590
you can just know a
little bit of JavaScript, it's

435
00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:47.610
not hard at all to
make a Firefox extension And

436
00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:49.500
you can access pretty much
anything on the page, but

437
00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:52.020
they can also access other
parts mean it's not just

438
00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:54.480
the, the, the JavaScript Dom,
but you can get two

439
00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:57.720
aspects of the user interface.
Right. You can talk to,

440
00:21:57.990 --> 00:21:59.790
how do you do that?
What the Juul does it

441
00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:01.940
lets you talk to the
outside, what you called the,

442
00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:04.380
Yeah, exactly. You can talk
to the Chrome, what we're

443
00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:07.980
using using the XML sophistication,
you can say, you know,

444
00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:11.040
you know, you can add
menu items and buttons and

445
00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:13.830
then that's that kind of,
So the Chrome is the,

446
00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:17.280
the term for the, the
outer shell of, of Mozilla.

447
00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:20.730
I see Exactly. That's the
Firefox, the Firefox menus and

448
00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:22.800
status bar and Okay. But
the part that's not the

449
00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:27.000
renderer, it's not the renderer.
That's kind of anti-climactic isn't

450
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.100
it. So I can just
open up the delicious dot

451
00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:30.900
XPI and go and see
how they did that and

452
00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:33.300
make my own like, just
like that. Yeah. It's really,

453
00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:34.860
it's really not hard. I
mean, there's a, there's a

454
00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:37.470
certain folder structure and, and
that kind of thing, but

455
00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:39.240
it's really, it's really not
difficult. In fact, at this

456
00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:42.510
point now Firefox twos, developer
tools are much, much better.

457
00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:45.570
I started developing extensions for
Firefox 0.9 and it was

458
00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:48.360
just, Oh, it was a
nightmare, but things had gotten

459
00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:50.130
a lot better. And in
fact, if I it's just

460
00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:53.310
a Google away, there are
a few developer tools. I

461
00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:55.710
mean, there's one that it's
like a wizard that's like

462
00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:57.870
put in the name of
your extension, you know, put

463
00:22:57.870 --> 00:23:01.140
in, you know, you've kind
of enter in basic information

464
00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:03.330
and it creates a skeleton
for you to start with

465
00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:07.860
Gina, what is to do
dot text? Oh, to do

466
00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:10.230
that text is the way
that I could keep track

467
00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:14.700
of all my, to dues
and projects and that kind

468
00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:17.820
of thing. And I wrote
just a simple text file,

469
00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:20.160
but I, I found myself
opening it up in an

470
00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:23.010
editor and rearranging it and
sorting it and wanting to

471
00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:25.320
kind of tag it with
keywords and, and only see

472
00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:27.900
the lines that had certain
keywords. So I wound up

473
00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:30.030
writing a script. It's a,
it's a shell script, which

474
00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:32.760
I actually run in Sigma
and on windows, which is

475
00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:35.220
a Unix emulator. So it's
a, it's a bash script.

476
00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:39.330
It's not a batch script,
which, which manages my to

477
00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:43.310
do that tax. So if
I add a task to

478
00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:45.090
my, to do text, which
is just a plain text,

479
00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:50.180
which has, you know, project
life hacker, a draft idea

480
00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:53.870
for next week's feature, that
would be, say, one line

481
00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:56.180
am I to do text?
And my, my to do

482
00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:58.670
text script can say, I
can say, show me all

483
00:23:58.670 --> 00:24:01.580
of the life hacker related
to do's that I have,

484
00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:04.250
or show me all the
home improvement to do's that

485
00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:06.700
I've, that I've listed. How
big is your to do

486
00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:10.300
dot text right now? I
try and keep mine actually

487
00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:13.690
to under a hundred lines.
So yeah, it's about, it's

488
00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:16.390
about a 90 lines. Yeah.
My to do text isn't

489
00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:19.870
a dumping ground for everything.
It's it's next action. That's

490
00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:22.540
like what David Allen would, would,
would consider a next action.

491
00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:25.900
It's like very concrete thought
out committed to, I'm definitely

492
00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:28.990
doing this next action. Yeah.
I'm looking at your, to

493
00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:31.810
do dot a S H
your shelf, your shell script,

494
00:24:32.290 --> 00:24:36.790
and you just say like
T list tax return and

495
00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:40.330
it filters out those, just
those things that apply to

496
00:24:40.330 --> 00:24:42.250
your tax return. I mean,
everyone's got a, to do

497
00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:44.320
dot text on their desktop,
or it has had one

498
00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:46.780
at some point a I
do right now and it's

499
00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:49.270
just, it has no structure
at all. So you've kind

500
00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:52.300
of come up with a
pretty simple tag structure with

501
00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:56.590
prefixes and suffixes to give
context to that all within

502
00:24:56.590 --> 00:25:00.550
the next actions, a kind
of good stalled. Exactly. Exactly.

503
00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:02.860
And there also, you can
also add context. So like

504
00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:06.730
if, you know, call Scott
is a phone call, I

505
00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:08.560
have to make, I would
say the context there is

506
00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:11.770
at phone. So if I
am, you know, sitting at

507
00:25:11.770 --> 00:25:13.420
my desk and I've got
access to a phone, but

508
00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:15.280
nothing else I can say,
Hey, show me all the,

509
00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:16.990
all the phone calls I
have to make and just

510
00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:18.710
say list, you know, at
phone I can and I

511
00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:20.350
would, and I, and I
would get those. So it's

512
00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:23.800
basically just, it's basically just
like tagging tasks so you

513
00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:25.720
can kind of slice and
dice them, however you want

514
00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:28.450
at the command line. Look,
wow. That's very interesting because

515
00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:31.600
I just installed office 2007
and it was like 800

516
00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:33.910
megs and it takes 300
megs of Ram and I'm

517
00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:37.090
using it to manage my
next actions. And, and you

518
00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:40.060
have a text file with
a hundred lines and I'm

519
00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:44.170
jealous the simplicity. It is.
It's just, it's, it's funny

520
00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:47.980
that, that, that just like
the sinking to paper that

521
00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:51.100
we talked about before, the
idea that sometimes it's comforting

522
00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:52.600
just to get a three
by five card and write

523
00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:55.630
down what you have to
do there, there is, there

524
00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:57.820
is comfort in a, in
a simple text file and,

525
00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:00.130
and a clean, I mean,
I'm sure that you can

526
00:26:00.610 --> 00:26:03.280
add something to that instantly,
right? It takes you no

527
00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:04.990
time at all. You don't
have to launch anything. You

528
00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:07.810
just go T ad boom.
And then it's done. Yup.

529
00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:09.190
Yup. I've got a little,
I've got a lot of

530
00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:14.020
keyboard shortcuts. Yep. That's fantastic.
So Gina, how many blogs

531
00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:19.360
do you have? Cause I'm
seeing well, just websites. Like

532
00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:25.360
I see spun and the
digital journalist and scribbling.net is.

533
00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:28.000
And then there's the, the
other one, which I mentioned

534
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.280
before misbehaving.net. You seem to
have a lot of projects.

535
00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:35.050
I have a lot of
projects going on. Not all

536
00:26:35.050 --> 00:26:37.540
of those are mine. The
digital journalist is a, is

537
00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:39.820
a photo journalism magazine, which
I produced there. Actually one

538
00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:44.910
of my clients spawn is
kind of developer blog, which

539
00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:47.520
doesn't get updated very frequently.
Cause I'm usually life hacking.

540
00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:51.240
Most of my time, scribbling
is my, is my personal

541
00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:53.460
blog, which also doesn't get
updated very often. You can

542
00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:55.230
go there to check, to
see, you know, pictures of

543
00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:57.990
my cat and what I
had for lunch, all that

544
00:26:57.990 --> 00:27:00.750
kind of fun stuff. And
misbehaving is a group of

545
00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:03.390
site that I work with
with a bunch of other

546
00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:06.290
folks. So That's cool. So
the life hacks are working

547
00:27:06.290 --> 00:27:08.540
apparently have all this time
to do all these projects.

548
00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:11.750
I don't know if you
look at the last updated

549
00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:14.000
date on a few of
those sites, you might not

550
00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:19.550
think so. So you're, you're
a professional blogger. Yeah. That's

551
00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:21.470
fair to say. I mean,
everyone blogs, I mean, not

552
00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:23.330
everyone, but I mean, a
lot of people blog, a

553
00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:24.950
lot of people say, well,
gee, how can I monetize

554
00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:27.110
my blog? I know I've
got a little ad sense.

555
00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:29.390
And a little as Tamara
said, us ads. And you

556
00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:30.470
know, I think it brings
in a couple of hundred

557
00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:33.230
bucks a month and I
use it to, to basically

558
00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:36.830
eat, you know, that's, that's,
you know, we're not buying

559
00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:40.670
cars and flying off to
Cabo with the blood money.

560
00:27:40.670 --> 00:27:45.560
We're making blogging, blogging pays
your mortgage. Yes, I am.

561
00:27:45.650 --> 00:27:47.390
I am a professional blogger,
although it's hard for me

562
00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:50.660
to say that without, without
laughing a little bit. How

563
00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:53.840
do you do that? Well,
you know, one of the

564
00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:56.690
difference between doing life hacker
and doing my personal blog

565
00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:59.570
is that, you know, Gawker
media publishes life hacker. So

566
00:27:59.570 --> 00:28:01.940
it's more like writing for
a magazine than writing for

567
00:28:01.970 --> 00:28:04.520
then writing, you know, my
own blog, like, you know,

568
00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:07.550
working at writing life hacker
is like, you know, we

569
00:28:07.550 --> 00:28:11.630
have a whole kind of
sales department and tech department

570
00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:12.860
that kind of takes care
of a lot of stuff

571
00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:15.980
behind the scenes. And I
get paid, you know, not

572
00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:19.130
a salary, but more as
a contractor, you know, to

573
00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:21.410
the right, to write the
site, You're not paid like

574
00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:24.110
per word or per blog.
That there's just a sense

575
00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:25.700
that you're doing a good
job. And they say, well,

576
00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:27.140
I think that this was
a great week for life

577
00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:30.440
hacker. Well, we get paid
on a, on a post

578
00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:33.200
basis. And then that we
also get, we get bonuses

579
00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:36.570
for like traffic increases. Oh
really? So they, they, they

580
00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:39.000
track that kind of stuff.
So Gawker media ma they

581
00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:41.300
have a number of different
blogs. Yes they do. I

582
00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:45.080
think 15 right now, Like
about life hacker.com is the

583
00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:48.230
quality of the posts is
great. It's not just like

584
00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:52.250
stream of consciousness blah-blah-blah and
you know, it's, it's a

585
00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:55.100
lot like Scott's blog in
that way and you know,

586
00:28:55.330 --> 00:28:56.870
I'm just seeing it for
the first time. So that's

587
00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:59.330
why I'm comparing yours to
his, in the geek world.

588
00:28:59.330 --> 00:29:01.640
We'd say the signal to
noise ratio is very high,

589
00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:04.820
very high. Yeah. And, you
know, complete with very nice

590
00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:07.510
graphics that are laid out
and in an, in an

591
00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:11.030
intelligent way. And you know,
that's very nice to be

592
00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:13.100
able to, I would come
back here again and again,

593
00:29:13.610 --> 00:29:15.560
Oh, this is, I actually
have a folder in my,

594
00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:16.820
I've got an, you know,
I've got like, I don't

595
00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:19.460
know, 1500 blogs, whatever. I
I've got a folder called

596
00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:22.430
essential. And that's like the,
if I can't read any

597
00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:24.320
blogs at all today, here
are the 12 that I

598
00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:28.730
read and life hackers. Well,
they're under L Awesome. Excellent.

599
00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:32.900
It's like the, site's like
an gadget, you know, I

600
00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:35.000
actually, frankly, I hate to
say this, then I may

601
00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:38.060
get my geek card revoked,
but I haven't read slash.in

602
00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:44.080
a while. It's just the
sick silence vile. I don't

603
00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:48.100
like blogging bile. I like
positivism. That's a word. I

604
00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:51.400
pretty much, I pretty much
read dig now. Really most

605
00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:54.760
of the time. Yeah. And
Google news, I'm liking these,

606
00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:57.040
I think of these boutique
sites. I don't have to

607
00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:59.140
call, I apologize for calling
a life hack or a

608
00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:02.830
boutique site, but it's, it's
focused on one thing and

609
00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:05.650
it's, you're, you're, you're obviously
careful not to just turn

610
00:30:05.650 --> 00:30:09.850
it into a link dumping
site. Yes. I'm sure that

611
00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:11.560
you're conscious about that kind
of stuff. It sounds like

612
00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:13.570
you're really less of a
blogger and more of a

613
00:30:13.570 --> 00:30:15.670
professional journalist. Is that a
better way to put it

614
00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:18.400
or professional technology writer? The
blog is just one of

615
00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:21.870
the representations of that. Yes.
Yeah. When someone somewhere in

616
00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:25.050
between a blogger and a
journalist, for sure. Okay. What's

617
00:30:25.050 --> 00:30:28.650
your favorite life hack all
time favorite? Oh, all time

618
00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:33.660
favorite. Oh, that's a tough
one. You know, if we've

619
00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:36.240
done about 8,000 posts on
the site at this point,

620
00:30:37.050 --> 00:30:39.210
and I love them all
like my children, Well, what

621
00:30:39.210 --> 00:30:40.890
are ones that you do
every day? What's the like,

622
00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:43.200
Oh, wow. I'm so glad
I have that. And I

623
00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:46.950
use it every day. I
would say definitely index cards

624
00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:50.130
in my back pocket to
write things down that come

625
00:30:50.130 --> 00:30:52.500
up in my mind. Absolutely.
Yeah. I have a, I

626
00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:54.390
have a little bit of,
you know, like most programmers,

627
00:30:54.390 --> 00:30:57.000
a little bit of add
things, come up. I got

628
00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.890
to get them out or
else I'll get hung up

629
00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:03.540
on them. I do. I
do have a Moschino, which

630
00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:05.760
I really like, although Moschino
is such an, it's such

631
00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:08.130
a beautiful notebook that I
feel bad about sticking in

632
00:31:08.130 --> 00:31:09.960
my back pocket and sitting
on it and, you know,

633
00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:12.330
getting it dirty. So I,
yeah, I'm trying to get

634
00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:14.610
Carl into the Moschino. This,
this is the iPod of

635
00:31:14.610 --> 00:31:19.380
personal notebooks, right? Hemingway had
one. Yeah. I'm kinda the

636
00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:20.970
same way. And what'll happen
with me is I'll get

637
00:31:20.970 --> 00:31:24.090
about halfway through it, filling
it. And then I'll just

638
00:31:24.090 --> 00:31:27.270
say, well, I want a
fresh one. Yes. And I'm

639
00:31:27.270 --> 00:31:29.220
always jealous of those people.
You go into their office

640
00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:30.960
and they get like 15
of them and they're all

641
00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:33.630
filled up. And they were
like labeled with the month

642
00:31:33.630 --> 00:31:35.280
that they wrote it and
they can go back and,

643
00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:38.520
and ended up. I'm never
writing enough in these things.

644
00:31:38.610 --> 00:31:40.740
I pretty much do all
my work on a, a

645
00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:45.450
Samsung PDA phone, a pocket
PC phone. And without that,

646
00:31:45.450 --> 00:31:49.530
I'm pretty much screwed. It's
tough. There's a, there's a

647
00:31:49.530 --> 00:31:53.520
certain visceral glee that I
get from having a piece

648
00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:55.560
of paper. I mean, sometimes
when I'm stressed out, I

649
00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:57.900
don't take my laptop to
a coffee shop cause I

650
00:31:57.900 --> 00:31:59.490
gotta go. I have to
get all those windows out

651
00:31:59.490 --> 00:32:02.220
of the way. The way
I get the windows out

652
00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:05.640
of the way is with
a piece of paper Fisher

653
00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:11.040
space pen. Hmm. Hmm. Absolutely.
Well, fantastic. I really appreciate

654
00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:13.440
you taking the time to
give us a call. We've

655
00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:15.060
got a kind of a
three way phone call. You're

656
00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:18.240
in the Bay area. I'm
in San Diego, actually San

657
00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:23.160
Diego via Brooklyn though. So
Cal you're in you're from

658
00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:26.490
Brooklyn originally. And why did
you move out to the

659
00:32:26.490 --> 00:32:30.510
West coast to blog? No,
actually Gawker's based in New York

660
00:32:30.510 --> 00:32:33.210
city. So, but, but we
have editors kind of all

661
00:32:33.210 --> 00:32:35.190
over the, all over the
country. I moved out to

662
00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:37.710
California just to, you know,
learn how to surf, have

663
00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:41.570
a couple of burritos. That's
fantastic. That's fantastic. Well, we

664
00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:43.460
really appreciate you taking the
time. We're going to put

665
00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:46.970
all the links to the
delicious category for life hacks

666
00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:50.390
to life, hacker.com to the
geek Deliv stuff too. You've

667
00:32:50.390 --> 00:32:52.640
got a how to, on
how to write a Firefox

668
00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:55.370
extension. We'll post that up
there as well as information

669
00:32:55.370 --> 00:32:57.830
on the term life hacks
and where that came from.

670
00:32:58.310 --> 00:33:00.620
And then we're also post
links to your book on

671
00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:02.360
Amazon. It's coming out in
a week or two, right?

672
00:33:02.410 --> 00:33:04.300
Yes it is. Yes it
is. Thank you so much.

673
00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:07.270
I really appreciate it. This
has been great. Gina. Thanks

674
00:33:07.270 --> 00:33:10.780

00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:13.090
