<inaudible>. Hi, this is Scott

8
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.140
Hanselman. This is another episode
of Hanselminutes today. I'm talking

9
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.430
with Troy hunt security expert
and also my friend calling

10
00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.070
in from Australia. How are
you, sir? Good. I might.

11
00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.060
I'm good. You just, if
I understand correctly, you spoke

12
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.970
to the United States Congress, and
you're not even from here.

13
00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.790
How did that happen? I
know I was worried. They'd

14
00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.000
find out, but no, it
was, it was an amazing

15
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.780
thing, actually. So I had
some folks from this, a

16
00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.650
house energy committee, house energy
and commerce committee reach out

17
00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.640
back in about September wanting
to talk about Equifax, because

18
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.080
that was a big news
story. They want to talk

19
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.080
about how data breaches were
happening so that they could

20
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.840
then grill the CEO of
Equifax, which they did in

21
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.240
Congress. And then they popped
up a little bit later

22
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.060
and said, Hey, how about
you? You hop over and

23
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.640
chat about data breaches and
what it means to our

24
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.790
ability to do knowledge based
authentication. Is that like, I,

25
00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.320
I don't think that talking
tech with what I assume

26
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.270
are highly nontechnical congresspeople, that
sounds super exciting. Were they

27
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.940
more or less a for
lack of a better word,

28
00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.130
clever or educated about this,
then you would thought they

29
00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.030
would be, you know, it's
interesting that the mechanics of

30
00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.650
the way it works is
that the folks sitting there

31
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.530
with, when you see a
testimony in progress, the facts

32
00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.080
sitting there asking questions, you
know, the important people in

33
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.890
the suits, they're asking questions
that other people have prepared

34
00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.300
for them, that their staff
has prepared for them. And

35
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.990
I didn't realize that until
I went over there. So

36
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.940
in one way, it's a
little bit hard to tell

37
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.550
because a very insightful sounding
question could have been written

38
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.650
by someone else, but then
at the end of the

39
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.170
day, they're there being that,
the face of that question

40
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.230
and having the, sort of
the discussion with you, and

41
00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.570
they need to understand what
they're talking about. And to

42
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.120
be honest, everyone that I
did speak to they're both

43
00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.750
on camera, on the record
and afterwards as well, they

44
00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.450
were very switched on. They're
genuinely interested in, and frankly,

45
00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.590
everyone's just lovely. Oh, that's
comforting to know you sound

46
00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:46.160
surprised, right? I mean, there's
certain levels of, of levels

47
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.610
of quality, expectation and education
in, in government right now.

48
00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.860
I think we just don't
think, I don't think about

49
00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.710
my member of Congress as
being a cybersecurity expert and

50
00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.220
educated enough to help me.
So that's good that you're,

51
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.850
You're there to help them.
Yeah, Yeah. That, and that's

52
00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.830
it. And look, I think
for me, that was the

53
00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.130
takeaway. It's like, this is
important enough that they actually

54
00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.340
want to spend time talking
about this. And look, we

55
00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.310
all like to throw shade
at governments all over the

56
00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.070
world and not just at
yours, but houses as well.

57
00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.620
And at the end of
the day, these are people

58
00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.480
trying to do a job
with a lot of issues

59
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.550
on their plate. And I'm
just glad that they, they

60
00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.750
saw this woman as being
important enough. So I have

61
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.450
just gone to your website,
the website that you're the

62
00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.810
most well known for certainly
Troy hunt.com is a wealth

63
00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.500
of resource, but I'm at,
have I been poned that's

64
00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.000
P w N E d.com.
I put in my email

65
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.990
address and it tells me
that I'm poned on 17

66
00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:50.130
breached sites and one paste.
Well, you baiting may congrats.

67
00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.470
And you explain to me
why that's bad and maybe

68
00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.040
what's going on here. Yeah,
Yeah. So look, have I

69
00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.250
been paying, this is a
data breach aggregation service. So

70
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.120
when we have a data
breach that occurs and our

71
00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.090
data and I'm in a
dozen myself, our data is

72
00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.220
picked up and it's spread
around the web as part

73
00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.580
of this big Corpus of
breached accounts. I aggregate that

74
00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.080
and I put it in
one place and I make

75
00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.840
it searchable. So you can
figure out your exposure. So,

76
00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.880
you know, when I look
at my account, I'm in

77
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.640
things like the LinkedIn database.
So LinkedIn had a data

78
00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.490
breach back in about 2012.
The data popped up in

79
00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.150
2016 and started circulating. I
grabbed that, put it in

80
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.390
the system, everyone who subscribes
to the services, a free

81
00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.360
subscription thing gets an email
address, says, Hey, we just

82
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.090
found you somewhere. And then
you can come along later

83
00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.550
on and go, Hey, well,
what is my exposure? Where

84
00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.740
have I been poned Hmm.
And I'm in, I'm in

85
00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.820
Dropbox, I'm in LinkedIn, I'm
in tumbler, but I don't

86
00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.750
know which password is, is,
is, is taken. So w

87
00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.060
what do I do? And
just like, I know that

88
00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.460
we have all I'm surely
you also have reused a

89
00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.800
password once or twice a
year. Oh yeah. Yeah. Look,

90
00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.170
I mean, I have seen
data pop up before I've

91
00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.030
seen my past when I've
just gone. Oh my God,

92
00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.610
what was I thinking? You
know, like we, we have

93
00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.570
all been there, the question
about which password, et cetera,

94
00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.690
is interesting. And I think
what's, what's particularly curious about,

95
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.480
have I been pined is
the, the way it drives

96
00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.530
awareness of the problems with
things like passwords. So for

97
00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.840
what I see happening the
whole time is I'll load

98
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.400
data into this system. So
I want to get an

99
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.040
email and it'll be like
LinkedIn, and they'll go, Oh

100
00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.280
man. Like I've just realized
that that LinkedIn password is

101
00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.820
the same one that I'm
using everywhere else. And it's

102
00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.950
the same one that I'm
using on my email address,

103
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.840
which is the thing that
people can get into and

104
00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.580
then reset all of my
accounts. So, you know, like

105
00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.850
bad news all around. So
I love the fact that

106
00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.390
have I been pine is,
is sort of the, the

107
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.580
educational piece that hits home,
like nothing else for your

108
00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.310
normal average, everyday consumers who
can come there and put

109
00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.280
their email address in, and
then suddenly realize just how

110
00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.860
risky it is to credentials.
It says 17 breached sites

111
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.170
and one paste. What is
a paste Paste is basically

112
00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:07.150
just a block of text,
which has dropped in a

113
00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:12.040
publicly accessible service. Like Pastebin.
So there's, Pastebin, there's another

114
00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:14.200
one called sexy there's ghost
being. There's a bunch of

115
00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:17.020
these services, which are just
designed to share blocks of

116
00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.720
text. And you, and I
might use that to, to

117
00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:23.140
share a code snippet or
something with each other bad

118
00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.540
dudes often use that to
dump a whole bunch of

119
00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:29.140
credentials from a data breach.
And very often actually we

120
00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:32.680
see Pastebin being used to
put little samplers of data

121
00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.420
breaches out there. So it'd
be like, look, he is,

122
00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:37.360
you know, say 10,000 records
from a much larger breach.

123
00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:40.750
And it often becomes the
Canary in the coal mine

124
00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.050
for when there is actually
a data breach. So I

125
00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:47.710
draw data from a Twitter
account called dump Mon, which

126
00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:51.790
goes and scrapes Pastebin looks
for patterns to establish what

127
00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:55.960
might be data breach, like
behavior for paste. And when

128
00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.430
I find that I pick
that up, I pull it

129
00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:59.230
into have a vampire and
I send an email to

130
00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:02.290
any of my subscribers who
might be in there. Oh,

131
00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.020
okay. I'm looking at Delmon.
And it seems to be

132
00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:08.080
quite active though. I mean,
it's seeing emails. It might

133
00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.240
be 10 emails. It might
be a hundred, but it's

134
00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:14.470
happening every 15, 20 minutes.
Yeah. It's nonstop. And in

135
00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:17.500
fairness as well, some of
this stuff is not necessarily

136
00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.410
a data breach there's logs
in there. There's there's in

137
00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.320
some cases, their source code
repositories and stuff like that,

138
00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.750
where there's just email addresses
that have appeared in that

139
00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:29.140
block of text. But very
frequently, when you go through

140
00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:31.900
and look at that dump
Mont account, you go to

141
00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:34.660
a particular Pastebin link Indigo.
Yeah. That that's, that's credentials,

142
00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:38.680
you know, that's usernames and
passwords. We see a really

143
00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.050
good example is I see
Spotify stuff pop up there

144
00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:44.560
the whole time. And this
is not necessarily Spotify having

145
00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.710
a data breach, but it's
lists of email addresses and

146
00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:51.160
passwords that work on Spotify
because people have raised their

147
00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.440
credentials. So someone will dump
a bunch of them pay,

148
00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:55.540
spend, and then go, Hey,
give me a slice of

149
00:07:55.540 --> 00:08:00.190
Bitcoin and I'll give you
more. Okay. How do you

150
00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:02.860
know? I mean, are you
manually looking at these to

151
00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:07.000
you? How has this wired
together? Is it just a

152
00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:10.870
regular expressions and wishes? Yeah,
pretty much the lead up.

153
00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.050
And I'm sort of quite
clear about that. So I've,

154
00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:15.760
I've kind of diverged in,
in two different directions here

155
00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:18.910
with evergreen pine. So there's
the, obviously the data breach

156
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:21.490
side of it. So you
mentioned LinkedIn and Dropbox. These

157
00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:26.380
are major incidents, verifiable high
degree of confidence. They're legitimate

158
00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:29.200
tens, hundreds of millions of
accounts in there. And then

159
00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.450
there's the Pastebin side of
it, which is, look, it's

160
00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:33.190
just a crawler that, you
know, I was just going

161
00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:37.330
through indexing stuff. If you
find yourself in there because

162
00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:38.800
you search, have I been
paying to you, get a

163
00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.470
notification, go and look at
the pace and figure out

164
00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:43.390
whether it's something you need
to be worried about or

165
00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:47.620
not. I went looking for
the pace that I'm found

166
00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:50.530
in and the website is
down and now the domain

167
00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:53.500
has been taken over by
someone that's not the pace

168
00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:57.180
person. Right. So that's, that's
Also possible. So there are

169
00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:00.780
some arbitrary pace where if
I find stuff just laying

170
00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:03.480
around on the internet that
is paced, like sometimes I'll

171
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.210
drop in an arbitrary URL
and that may be on

172
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:08.700
a host name, which disappears
at some time. And when

173
00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:10.830
you sort of think about
the nature of some of

174
00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:13.530
this data, it's like, yeah,
I can see why that

175
00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:15.540
would get pulled offline. You
know why that may not

176
00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:19.580
be there tomorrow. I'm looking
at the very bottom of

177
00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:24.320
how I've been poned and
it says 4.8 billion accounts.

178
00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:27.320
Oh no, that's insane. Isn't
it? Yeah. That's when I

179
00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:30.500
started this service. So this
is back in December, 2013, I

180
00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:34.520
started it with the, the
Adobe data breach, which was

181
00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:37.550
about 150 million accounts and a
few other really small ones.

182
00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:39.230
And I was like, man,
this is crazy. There's like

183
00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:43.580
150 million accounts in there. And
then it was only last

184
00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:46.610
year. So we're recording this
at the end of 2017.

185
00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:49.520
It was only in about
the middle of 2016 that

186
00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:52.610
I passed the first billion.
And I remember because I

187
00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:54.440
was at NDC and Oslo
and this was like part

188
00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:56.150
of the talk. It was
like, let's flick the switch.

189
00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:58.730
And it's like, do we
celebrate or cry that we

190
00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:02.210
just hit 1 billion? So I've
gone in the space of

191
00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:05.330
just the last year of
running it from 1 billion to

192
00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:08.570
4.8 billion last year and
a half, which is just

193
00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:10.490
like, if I say this
every day and it blows

194
00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:13.370
my mind that there's just
so much data flowing into

195
00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:17.270
the system. What did you
have experience in building a

196
00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:19.190
site that could handle that
kind of data? Because I

197
00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:22.370
assume that the, the scale
needed to make, have I

198
00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:25.430
been poned, it's not just
scale on a person, you

199
00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:28.160
know, on traffic hitting it,
but the backend must be

200
00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:31.940
terabytes. I didn't have experience
doing it on the cheap.

201
00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:36.740
So my experience was when
I stood, have I been

202
00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:39.500
piled up, I still had
an architecture role in Pfizer.

203
00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.690
So I was like, all
right, we're building via big

204
00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:45.260
systems. And as a multibillion
dollar company, and there's, there's

205
00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.690
lots of money for things
we needed to do. And

206
00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:50.930
I started building, have I
been poned as we were

207
00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:54.770
really diving into Azure within
the organization. And I'm like,

208
00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:58.280
you know, let's just, we'll
do a hobby project, play

209
00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:00.230
with the technology a little
bit, you know, see what

210
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:04.280
it does. And for me
that the challenge has become,

211
00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:06.920
how do I create something
that's getting bigger and bigger

212
00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:10.100
and bigger for the cheapest
possible amount of money. And

213
00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:11.450
to me, that's a bit
of a game, you know,

214
00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:13.580
that's a bit of fun.
So I, that was a

215
00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:18.230
new experience for me. Yeah.
I, even though I worked

216
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:20.150
for Microsoft in my day
job and talk a little

217
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:23.240
bit about Azure. I explained
to people that I talked

218
00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.940
to, that I pay for
my Azure sites with my

219
00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:29.510
own money. And you probably
shouldn't trust a Microsoft engineer

220
00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:31.760
or anyone who's trying to
sell you something if they

221
00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:35.420
have free Azure time. Right.
Cause they're gonna treat you

222
00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:37.520
differently. So I wrote a
bunch of blog posts called

223
00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:40.400
penny pinching in the cloud.
And if I can, you

224
00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.920
know, if I can run
20 websites on one small,

225
00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:47.510
well, that's, that's free, free
compute. So I would assume

226
00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:49.430
you're not making money on
having been poned other than

227
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:51.350
giving talks about it, you'd
want to make it as

228
00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:54.550
cheap as possible. Well know,
I remember reading That series

229
00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:57.010
of yours actually. And it
was a, yeah, I liked

230
00:11:57.010 --> 00:11:59.260
that term. And I think
there's a little bit of

231
00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.120
the engineer in us, which
is kind of like, this

232
00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:03.490
is a challenge, right? Like
how big can I make

233
00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:06.910
this thing for how cheap?
So it's interesting the way

234
00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:09.220
have I been paying sort
of evolved over time? So

235
00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:11.470
one of the things that
happened maybe about a year

236
00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:14.560
into it is people said,
ah, you should put a

237
00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:16.780
donations link. You know, like
you should let people give

238
00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:19.630
you money. And I was
sort of going, well, why

239
00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:21.520
would they give me money?
It's free? And people are

240
00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:23.490
like, no, no, no, seriously.
They will say, okay, I

241
00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:26.290
put a, put a donations
link on there. And I

242
00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:27.820
thought, you know, I don't
want to be sort of

243
00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:30.250
sleazy about it. I'm not
just going to go, please

244
00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:32.290
give me money. I thought,
what I'll do is I'll

245
00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:34.390
say, look, I do this
out of my own free

246
00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:37.210
time. I pay for the
know, whatever costs, et cetera,

247
00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:40.270
come out of my own
pocket. I spend a lot

248
00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:42.040
of time away from my
family. Wouldn't it be nice

249
00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:44.470
if you bought me a
movie ticket, they'll take the

250
00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:46.960
kids to the movie or,
you know, it's been a

251
00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:49.270
long, hard day here, buy
me beer. And I put

252
00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:52.480
that on the donations page
and it will just sort

253
00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:56.260
of, I guess, more interesting,
tangible stuff. And I started

254
00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.000
getting a lot of donations
for it. So, you know,

255
00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.910
to this day I get
donations that, that certainly well

256
00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:03.130
and truly cover all the
costs of it, which is,

257
00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:07.660
which is actually surprising and
fantastic. And then the other

258
00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:10.360
thing that's happened over time,
as well as there's been

259
00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:13.570
more companies that have popped
up and said, look, for

260
00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:15.700
example, we're an identity theft
company. In fact, I wrote

261
00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:17.770
about this at the time
the company popped up, said

262
00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:20.680
we do identity theft monitoring.
We would really love to

263
00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:22.810
be able to access this
data because we have got

264
00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:26.710
a 40 million subscribers in the
case of my life, who

265
00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:28.660
are the ones I wrote
about my life said, look,

266
00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:30.190
we would love to be
able to tap into this

267
00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:33.850
data because we've got 40 million
people that we can reach

268
00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:37.300
and let know about these
incidents. And you know, to

269
00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:39.550
my mind, I thought, well,
that's, that's great. Like that

270
00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:43.350
expands the awareness. So when
they popped up, I started

271
00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:47.640
added making some information available
to commercial subscribers. And this

272
00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:49.350
is not, you know, you
won't find a buy now

273
00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:51.360
link or anything on the
site. It's not like you

274
00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:54.180
go there and give me
money to it. Couldn't they

275
00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:57.750
just do it without asking,
you know? And that, there's

276
00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:00.600
a few reasons for that.
So one of the reasons

277
00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:03.450
is that in more recent
times, and this is partly

278
00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:06.030
an effort to keep cost
down and partly keep ethical

279
00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:09.240
use of made the service
rate limited. So you can

280
00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:11.550
only make one request to
that database, every one and

281
00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:14.610
a half seconds. So basically
the max that a human

282
00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:17.190
would want to do on
the interface. So I've done

283
00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:20.490
that. The other thing is
I've always made sure that

284
00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:25.470
certain data breaches are never
publicly accessible. So for example,

285
00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:27.390
if you're a listener who
was in the Ashley Madison

286
00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:29.780
data breach, you will not
be able to get out

287
00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:32.070
to the front page and
find Ashley Madison in the

288
00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:35.670
results. You will be able
to go and subscribe to

289
00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:38.850
the notification service, which is
free. And you get an

290
00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:41.310
email with a verification token
in it. And then you

291
00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:43.470
go after you've proven that
you control the email and

292
00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:46.260
it will say, yeah, look,
you're in Ashley Madison. So

293
00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.560
that's never been available either.
And over time as it's

294
00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:53.810
sort of unfolded there's organizations
that do things like provide

295
00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:56.520
a beta based all services
in the security space. So

296
00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:59.480
last I look where we're
a security company. We have

297
00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:02.600
a bunch of organizations that
use our services. They'd love

298
00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.790
to be able to access
this data on a domain

299
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:08.090
level. So that's something that
you can do for free

300
00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:10.280
on the public site, if
you can control the domain.

301
00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:13.940
And it's something that some
subscribers get access to commercially,

302
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.390
if they've got customers that,
that need this information, but

303
00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:21.880
can't necessarily prove that control
the domain. Oh, okay. Did

304
00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:25.240
that change the way that
you originally architected and scaled

305
00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:30.910
the site? Because I'm thinking
naively just hold 4 billion password

306
00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:34.660
accounts, you know, owned accounts
into a hash table and

307
00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:36.490
there you go. Now you
got a website, but then

308
00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:39.250
if you're doing things by
domain, if you're doing things

309
00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:45.670
with notifications that suddenly you're
thinking about a much more

310
00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:49.270
complicated site. So it boils
down to the petitioning of

311
00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:51.400
it. So the underlying data
structure for all of this

312
00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:54.940
is Azure table storage. And
that's what it was when

313
00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:57.130
I started back in the
day. It's still exactly the

314
00:15:57.130 --> 00:16:00.160
same structure today. I'm starting
to look at cosmos a

315
00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:03.370
little bit more now, but
that's another, another discussion. But

316
00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:05.980
the way I designed the
table storage is I said,

317
00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:08.650
look, what I'm going to
do is this is just

318
00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:10.570
going to hold email addresses.
This is all it is.

319
00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:14.710
I'm going to make every
pimp, every petition the name

320
00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:16.900
of the domain. So there
is a really, really big

321
00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:20.680
gmail.com petition. And then the
ROCI of every record is

322
00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:23.980
going to be the alias.
So that made things really,

323
00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:26.920
really super fast to look
up by individual email address.

324
00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:28.930
Cause we know exactly which
petition to go to and

325
00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:32.710
exactly which row to go
to. And usually the look-ups

326
00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:35.950
even amongst those 4.8 billion
records, a single digit milliseconds,

327
00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:38.740
but it also means that
if I want to go

328
00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:41.170
and pull an entire domain,
I just grabbed the petition.

329
00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:44.590
Now I can't really do
that for g-mail. It's just

330
00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:48.910
too big, but for 99
point X percent of domains,

331
00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:51.610
we can go look just
return the whole petition for

332
00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:55.690
Troy hunt.com or whatever it
may be. And yeah, even

333
00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:57.520
when there's hundreds of thousands
of records in there that

334
00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:02.440
still works quite well. Hmm.
Okay. Let me pivot a

335
00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:06.520
little bit because as I
scroll through your blog, which

336
00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:10.450
is like 70 pages of
information on data breaches and

337
00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:13.930
HTTPS and your Pluralsight courses
and all the different things,

338
00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:16.450
I get the same feeling
that I get when I

339
00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:18.910
go to anyone's security site,
who is a security expert

340
00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:22.450
is I think to myself,
we're all going to die.

341
00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:28.690
And it's probably probably my
fault as a programmer. I'm

342
00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:31.000
trying to get a sense
of like how freaked out

343
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.680
I should be. Like, I
read a blog post of

344
00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:35.470
yours on a thing that
was a honeypot or something.

345
00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:38.680
It was called a pineapple.
You, if I find fall

346
00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:42.550
well, yeah, they're kind of
two different things. Look at

347
00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:45.220
the wifi pineapple look, if
fennel is listening and they

348
00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:47.260
don't know what, this is,
just Google my name and

349
00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:49.950
wifi pineapple. And you'll say
it, but it's, it's a

350
00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:53.340
rogue wireless access hotspot, or
can be a rogue wireless

351
00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:57.060
hotspot. And all it is
is it's a little device.

352
00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:58.650
You can buy it for
a company called hack five.

353
00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:00.930
So a hundred bucks for
the, for the nano one,

354
00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:04.320
which is the cheap one.
And you use power of

355
00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:06.090
our USBs. We can literally
just plug it into your

356
00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:09.000
PC and then you can
create your own hotspot and

357
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.180
you might call it free
cafe wifi. And if you

358
00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:15.720
call it anything free, people
will connect to it. I

359
00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.760
got to conferences, sometimes part
of the talk, I'll call

360
00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:20.590
it free NSA, wifi. People
will connect to it because

361
00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:22.740
they say free. And then
they go, yeah, that's it.

362
00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:26.160
I mean like I'm sold
and now you have traffic

363
00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:29.010
routed through a device that
you control. And then you

364
00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:31.110
can route that back out
through your own internet connection.

365
00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:34.770
And the reason I show
this device is that this

366
00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:37.710
allows us to have a
discussion about man in the

367
00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:41.460
middle and why HTTPS is
so important in a very

368
00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:45.180
impactful evidence based way. So
I've found this has been

369
00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:49.740
an awesome device for trying
to get people realizing that,

370
00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:51.930
that something like a man
in the middle, it is

371
00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:54.570
not a hypothetical threat. It's
not just like a nation,

372
00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:57.300
state actor kind of threat.
It's like, yeah, someone bought

373
00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:58.680
one off the internet for
a hundred bucks and now

374
00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:02.630
they have your traffic. So
it's impactful though. What is

375
00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:06.920
it? You say that HTTPS
is so important if even

376
00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:09.940
if I connect to your
free NSA, wifi, what, what

377
00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:12.530
can you Snoop about me?
Can you get my exchange

378
00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:15.140
passwords? Can you get my
Gmail passwords? Or can you

379
00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:18.650
not because they're over HDPS.
Yeah. It's, it's the latter.

380
00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:21.560
So anything that's sent over
an encrypted connection is solid.

381
00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:24.500
Now there's lots of nuances
here. And in fact, I've,

382
00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:26.960
I reckon this year, this
has almost been the year

383
00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:29.150
of, of all the different
things I've spoken about where

384
00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:32.210
HTTPS has been. The one
thing that's changed so much

385
00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:35.960
and has also become so
important. So yeah, what's really

386
00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:39.410
critical here is that we're
really rushing headlong into a

387
00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:43.190
secure by default internet. And
at the moment we're, we're

388
00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:46.460
still sort of in that
legacy era of things, defaulting

389
00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:48.260
to insecure. And I'll give
you a couple of good

390
00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:52.910
examples. If you go as
of today to cnn.com, you'll

391
00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:56.210
see nothing in the address
bar to indicate any sort

392
00:19:56.210 --> 00:19:59.870
of degree of insecurity. If
you go to let's say

393
00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:02.690
Troy hunt.com, you'll see there's
a green padlock and there's

394
00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:05.690
green text. And it says
secure. And the really interesting

395
00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:10.130
observation here is that security
is a very explicit visual

396
00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:12.590
indicator. And the only reason
we know something is not

397
00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:14.240
secure is because it doesn't
tell us that it is

398
00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:16.700
secure. And it's almost like
that that is our default

399
00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:19.870
position. You get no security,
just the same way as,

400
00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:24.140
as if you type@cnn.com into
the browser, it's going to

401
00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:27.380
make an HTTP request. And
at some point in time,

402
00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:29.720
they'll go HTTPS and then
it will manually three Oh

403
00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:32.020
one redirect, and you'll get
the, get the, a, the

404
00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:34.460
secure page, but it's still
going to try and secure

405
00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:36.980
first. And that look, there
are mechanical reasons why it

406
00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:39.620
needs to do that as
well. But it's just interesting

407
00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:42.560
the way it's been so
insecure, but where we are

408
00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:46.130
today is now we're up
to almost about 70% of

409
00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:48.730
all traffic on the web
being served are HTTPS, which

410
00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:52.390
is good. And that last
30% gap is being closed

411
00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:56.550
really quickly. But the, you
know, even, even myself as

412
00:20:56.550 --> 00:21:00.090
a fairly technical person, I
still find certificate management a

413
00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:03.540
hassle. Sometimes I forget when
I need, you know, like

414
00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:06.270
I'll have an, an obscure
site or a small site

415
00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:09.360
that I run and the,
the certificate will expire and

416
00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:11.250
I'll be like, Oh crap,
I've got to go and

417
00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:15.570
deal with it. Are those
problems solved or being solved?

418
00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:18.640
So this was sort of
getting us into the, the,

419
00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:21.540
the, what are the barriers
to HTTPS sort of round.

420
00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:24.480
And the two barriers that
I think are pretty closely

421
00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:27.810
linked here, a cost and
management effort. And if we

422
00:21:27.810 --> 00:21:30.930
scroll back, let's just scroll
back only two years. If

423
00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:33.420
you wanted a certificate, you
usually had to pay for

424
00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:35.760
it. It was usually about
70 bucks a year. There

425
00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:38.340
were some CAG go and
get them for, for free.

426
00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:40.680
If you're a not-for-profit and
then you'd have to go

427
00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:42.300
and get the certificate and
it might be in the

428
00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:44.490
wrong format. And then you'd
have to go and download

429
00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:47.640
open SSL and you'd have
to recompile it. You're singing

430
00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:51.660
my life. That's exactly what
I have to do RVP

431
00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:55.170
and do a windows machine
and set it up. It's

432
00:21:55.170 --> 00:21:57.690
horrible. I read a blog
post a few years ago

433
00:21:57.690 --> 00:21:59.580
about how to get a
free certificate on those, your

434
00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:01.530
website. And it was using
a company called <inaudible> dot

435
00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:04.920
com who no longer exists.
What's another story. And the

436
00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:07.500
blog post was like, here
are all the steps involved.

437
00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:09.390
And people were like, this
is really useful. Thank you

438
00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:11.700
for writing for me. It's
like, it's not for you

439
00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:13.470
as for me. So I
remember how to do it

440
00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:15.240
when I have to come
back and do it next

441
00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:18.960
year, because it was so
painful. It's funny. I think

442
00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:21.090
people who, I mean, you
and I have both been

443
00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:24.000
blogging for many, many years.
I think people forget. They

444
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.500
think that we are doing
that for the people. Pretty

445
00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:32.250
clear we're doing it for
ourselves Too. Subtle self interest,

446
00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:36.180
Almost all my blog posts
are me writing instructions that

447
00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:39.300
I will then go on
for later. This is the

448
00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:41.220
great thing too, because we
have the same problems that

449
00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:44.550
everyone else has. So look,
I mean, that was painful,

450
00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:46.770
that the effort of that
was hard. And, and then

451
00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:49.140
we get to the cost
side of things. And, you

452
00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:52.110
know, if you had someone
who was, who was either

453
00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:54.540
a small shop or a
personal blogger or something like

454
00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:57.690
that, 70 bucks a year
may not seem like much,

455
00:22:57.690 --> 00:23:00.270
but it is a financial
barrier. And people saying, well,

456
00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:02.820
I don't want to pay
70 bucks a year. So

457
00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:06.330
that there's two things that
have happened over that last

458
00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:08.820
couple of years that have
really fundamentally changed that the

459
00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:12.480
management effort and the cost
effort, and probably the first

460
00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:15.480
one worth mentioning here is
let's encrypt. So let's encrypt

461
00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:18.810
is a free not-for-profit entity,
which is backed by the

462
00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:22.710
likes of Mozilla or eff,
and they make certificates available

463
00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:25.170
for free. And they do
so in an automated fashion,

464
00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:26.760
which means that if you
want to get a let's

465
00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:30.210
encrypt certificate on say a
Linux box, if you can

466
00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:33.030
shell into that machine, run
a command, it will automatically

467
00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:35.580
verify that you can control
the website that's on that

468
00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:38.280
box. It will download the
certificate. And then also set

469
00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:40.110
up a Cron job to
go back and renew that

470
00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:43.020
certificate every three months, because
I do three months certificates.

471
00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:47.690
So that's like run this,
you're done, you know? And,

472
00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:50.720
and he just don't think
about it again. And there's

473
00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:53.210
nothing wrong with their certificates.
You know, this is not

474
00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:55.910
like, Oh, it's free. It's
not as good as paying

475
00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:58.070
Komodo money or something like
that. That's, that's not a

476
00:23:58.070 --> 00:24:02.890
question. The mathematics works, Destroy
the market then does that

477
00:24:02.890 --> 00:24:06.280
mean that there's just no
market for anyone else? Well,

478
00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:08.470
this though, man, this is
going to get controversial now.

479
00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:12.340
So this has had a
major impact on the market

480
00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:15.040
because if we go back
only two years ago, let's

481
00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:17.950
encrypt really only started issuing
certificates to the general public

482
00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:21.730
in about April, 2016. So go
back to say, end of

483
00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:25.420
2015, two years before recording
Komodo had, I think it

484
00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:28.360
was about 40% of the
market, like a massive slice.

485
00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:30.880
And then let's encrypt came
along and people like, Oh,

486
00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:33.100
you know, this is cute.
We'll see how this goes.

487
00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:35.890
Maybe we don't really trust
it fast forward through to

488
00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:38.230
today. Then our larger than
Komodo in terms of the

489
00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:42.370
total number of certificates they've
issued at that active today,

490
00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:46.120
which is, which is insane.
So, you know, now we've

491
00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:48.610
got, let's encrypt becoming the
big guys, and this is

492
00:24:48.610 --> 00:24:51.460
having a really severe impact
on the commercial CAS, because

493
00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:52.690
they're going, hang on a
mind. We used to make

494
00:24:52.690 --> 00:24:55.510
money out of this so
that the discussion now has

495
00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:58.540
become really interesting where we're
seeing that the commercial folks

496
00:24:58.810 --> 00:25:05.380
try to, I guess, move
more towards commoditization models, choose

497
00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:08.440
my words carefully here, because
you'll see why they're trying

498
00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:09.790
to figure out ways I
can make money out of

499
00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:11.580
it. And one of the
ways they're doing this as

500
00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:15.670
a saying, you should not
get a DV certificate. You

501
00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:18.460
should get an EBA certificate.
And, and what they're saying

502
00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:20.560
here is if you go
to a site like Toronto,

503
00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:24.670
you see a padlock and
it says secure, and it

504
00:25:24.670 --> 00:25:28.450
says, Troy hunt.com. You don't
know whether that is a

505
00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:31.120
good site or a bad
site. All you know is

506
00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:34.600
it's, it's the domain that
you went to. In fact,

507
00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:38.950
I've quoted you actually in
one of my books. So

508
00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:41.350
you wrote this Epic tweet,
which was something like, all

509
00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:43.450
you know is you're having
a secure discussion. You could

510
00:25:43.450 --> 00:25:47.410
be having a discussion with
site, right? So that the

511
00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:50.860
value proposition of a, of
an EBV certificate and extended

512
00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:53.890
validation certificate is that if
you got to say, have

513
00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:56.500
I been poned, you'll see
it literally says, have I

514
00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:58.300
been poned up in the
address bar? And then it's

515
00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:00.580
got my name in brackets.
So it's telling you that

516
00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:04.300
there is a legal entity
called have I been postponed?

517
00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:06.310
And I just went and
registered a cheap business name

518
00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:09.280
here in Australia. And then
who owns that legal entity,

519
00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:11.290
if there is a parent,
which in this case as

520
00:26:11.290 --> 00:26:14.380
me, and you can see
that certificate and you can

521
00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:17.310
see that visual indicator and
go, okay, well, look, I,

522
00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:20.020
I know that this, these,
the actual company site that

523
00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:22.540
I'm looking at at the
moment, so that's the way

524
00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:27.010
they're now trying to make
their money. So do I,

525
00:26:27.010 --> 00:26:29.470
I'm looking on your site.
It just says secure. It

526
00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:31.060
doesn't say Troy hunt, but
if I go to have

527
00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:33.070
I been poned it says,
have I been polling, Troy

528
00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:36.910
hunt? It's it's longer. It's
green. It's it's it's indicates

529
00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:42.940
a security and presume a
trust. Well, yeah. Now this

530
00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:45.810
is, it gets really interesting.
And that is, here's a

531
00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:49.410
good game for the listeners
as well. The commercial CAS

532
00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:52.080
will say, you should have
an Evie because an E

533
00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:54.630
does imply trust, right? It's
either, we'll give people a

534
00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:57.510
greater level of trust. They
will respect your site more.

535
00:26:57.510 --> 00:26:59.130
They'll sign up more. They'll
give you more money, yada,

536
00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:03.870
yada, yada. Now here's the
problem. If this is the

537
00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:06.390
case, then you would assume
that big sites would want

538
00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:09.930
to have Evy, but see
how many of the world's

539
00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:14.340
top 10 largest websites have
either. So for example, Facebook.

540
00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:17.360
So for the listeners at
home, does Facebook have an

541
00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:21.420
Navy certificate without looking at?
No, it doesn't. What about

542
00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:25.710
Google? No. Google doesn't. What
about Amazon now? Amazon does

543
00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:29.750
it, Am I saying New York
times? Nothing. I know, right?

544
00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:33.140
It's like, it just simply
doesn't exist, but it does

545
00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:36.080
exist on some services some
of the time. So Twitter's

546
00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:38.870
a really good example. I
put a tweet out. This

547
00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:40.330
would have been in the
middle of the year, said,

548
00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:42.500
Hey, look, isn't it interesting.
Here's the top 10 sites.

549
00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:43.970
And I had a little
screen cap of all the

550
00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:47.780
tabs and none of them
had a V and, and

551
00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:49.580
one of them was Twitter.
That was the 10th largest

552
00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:51.710
site. And then a whole
bunch of people came back

553
00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:53.420
and said, well, hang on
a second. Twitter does have

554
00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:55.910
a V and here is
a screen cap. And then

555
00:27:55.910 --> 00:27:58.250
this guy in Norway said,
no, no, no, it doesn't.

556
00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:01.070
Here's a screen cap. And
what we actually discovered is

557
00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:04.190
that Twitter, depending on where
you are, we're serving up

558
00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:08.180
an EVP versus a DV
certificate. But here's the big,

559
00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:12.620
insightful part of this. I
got all these different places

560
00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:15.770
where Twitter doesn't does not
have an ABA certificate. And

561
00:28:15.770 --> 00:28:17.810
I had never noticed, and
I look for this stuff,

562
00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:21.140
right? So I'm sort of
going out if I don't

563
00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:24.080
know when it does or
it doesn't and everyone listening

564
00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:25.910
doesn't know either. And I
know you don't know, because

565
00:28:25.910 --> 00:28:27.470
I ask this question every
time I do a workshop,

566
00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:31.760
then does it actually change
your behavior in the absence

567
00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:35.270
of an AAV certificate? Because
the, this is the, the

568
00:28:35.270 --> 00:28:38.180
argument, right? The CAS will
say, well, if you don't

569
00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:40.460
have an eBay certificate, people
won't trust you as much,

570
00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:43.820
or actually no, like it,
frankly, we're doing a good

571
00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:47.870
job of people even look
for the padlock. It's interesting

572
00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:50.000
that you say that because
I used to work in

573
00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.580
banking and you know, you
and I are talking in

574
00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:56.120
end of 2017, early 2018.
I'm looking at a blog

575
00:28:56.120 --> 00:29:01.220
post that I wrote in
October of 2006. So we're

576
00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:04.670
talking 11 years ago. And
when he V certificates were

577
00:29:04.670 --> 00:29:07.040
still coming out and it
was a big deal, you

578
00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:09.200
had to actually go and
visit the data center and

579
00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:11.960
be audited. Like it was
hard to get one, right,

580
00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:15.500
and say what you will
about internet Explorer. But they

581
00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:18.260
were trying to push these
EVs certificates so much so

582
00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:22.670
that they would light up
the entire top bar in

583
00:29:22.670 --> 00:29:26.960
bright green, if there was
an Evie certificate. And now

584
00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:28.940
here we are, 11 years
later, it's supposed to be

585
00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:33.650
a secure web. And frankly,
the green in Chrome here,

586
00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:36.230
you know, could be kind
of a gray black. It

587
00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:38.750
doesn't really stand out if
they really were serious. Why

588
00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:41.740
don't they light up the
whole bar? Well, part of

589
00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:44.380
the problem Is not so
much. What do you show

590
00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:46.990
when a Navy certificate is
present, but it's, what do

591
00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:49.840
you show when it's not
present? Because really what you're

592
00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:51.790
trying to say here is
that if you go to

593
00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:53.860
a site and it doesn't
have an Navy certificate, you

594
00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:56.800
shouldn't trust it as much.
And, and this again is

595
00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:58.960
one of these problems where
you're trying to get people

596
00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:01.900
to change their behavior in
the absence of some form

597
00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:04.840
of visual indicator. And look,
I mean, we know how

598
00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:06.850
hard it is, just getting
users not to click through

599
00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:09.490
and ignore security warnings. You
know, like how much harder

600
00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:11.110
do you think it is
to say, Hey, when you

601
00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:13.150
go to a website and
you don't see this thing,

602
00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:15.940
you know, don't trust it.
And also we can't condition

603
00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:18.120
people to that because most
of the websites out there

604
00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:20.440
in most of the world's
largest websites, don't have one.

605
00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:24.030
Anyway, That's funny that you
mentioned that because I actually

606
00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:29.610
did a blog, a podcast
rather with Adrianne Porterfield, who

607
00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:33.450
does the usability security for
Chrome. She's a PhD and

608
00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:35.850
a security researcher at Google.
I did a podcast with

609
00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:40.380
her episode four 86. And
she talked about doing all

610
00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:42.960
the user testing and AB
testing to find out how

611
00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:46.110
can we keep people from
clicking past those security warnings?

612
00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:48.420
And she also told me
something interesting. Do you know

613
00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:54.330
what the number one cause
of security warnings is you're

614
00:30:54.330 --> 00:30:58.050
gonna love this. It's people
changing their clocks forward to

615
00:30:58.050 --> 00:31:00.360
try to get more coins
in games like candy crush.

616
00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:06.900
This is where we are.
And this is where we

617
00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:09.030
are, which is tragic because
we are at the end

618
00:31:09.030 --> 00:31:12.560
of our show. Oh man,
what a cell nine to

619
00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:15.060
a number. Well, I think
that great note is though

620
00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:17.460
that if you go to
<inaudible> dot com, you've got

621
00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:19.590
workshops and speaking, you're all
over the world and people

622
00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:22.320
can learn about security from
you. And because of things

623
00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:24.420
like this, I have a
long and fruitful career ahead

624
00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:26.340
of me. So thank you
everyone for putting your clocks

625
00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:29.610
forward, the candy crush, You
will never not have a

626
00:31:29.610 --> 00:31:32.850
job. Yep. I'm looking at
your upcoming events. You're in

627
00:31:32.850 --> 00:31:35.100
Australia. You're in London. We'll
be in London together in

628
00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:38.490
a couple of weeks and
you're all over the world.

629
00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:41.100
And I appreciate you. And
thanks so much for coming

630
00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:44.820
on the show. Good on
you. Thanks. This has been

631
00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:47.760
