with Richard Campbell about wind phone,

8
00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.130
Hi, this is Scott Hanselman
and this is another episode

9
00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.480
of Hansel minutes. It is
Christmas. It is in two

10
00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.320
days. How are you? Where's
your Campbell? I am fine.

11
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.360
My friend. It's good to
talk to you. It's nice

12
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.650
to talk to you, sir.
I haven't talked to you

13
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.440
in a million years. We've
been all scary, busy running

14
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.080
around, you know, doing real
work and stuff. Yeah, it's

15
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.740
a, it has been a
little bit wacky. This, this,

16
00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.290
this year. And of course
last night was a little

17
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.300
wacky for me. Cause it's
Christmas. I was trying to

18
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.440
put together something, putting together
a gift. I strained myself,

19
00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:27.200
assembling exercise equipment. That's a
little ironic. I think it's

20
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.380
exactly ironic. I think it's,
Alannis Morissette ironic. It is.

21
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.390
I should've limbered up while
putting together the exercise machine

22
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.680
and I pulled something and
you know, you know, you're

23
00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.430
really old when you're, when
you're damaging your hips. And

24
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.320
I'm like, I woke up
today and I'm like, Oh

25
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.760
my hip. I've pulled something
in my hip and I'm

26
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.190
hoping, I don't know what's
next. I think what I'm

27
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:58.400
<inaudible> you wouldn't otherwise ake
there, but now you do

28
00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.880
only old people have bad
hips and I'm old now.

29
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.190
And I haven't been here
you go. It's all I

30
00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.370
can think of. I just,
I'm speaking of stressing hips,

31
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.680
I've just committed to going
to Nepal again in the

32
00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.010
spring. So that'll be walking
uphill and downhill for 14

33
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.440
days. Oh my goodness. Do
you like doing this kind

34
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.050
of stuff or do you
regret it once you've made

35
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.090
the, when you, when you
put the plan, like, I

36
00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.950
know I'm old, I put
the plan in place and

37
00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.610
I go, no, what am
I doing? It's one of

38
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.350
those things where if I
don't have a big goal,

39
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.560
I just can't get excited
about it. Exercise. And you

40
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.660
know, having to walk at
high altitude day after day

41
00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.720
after day is a good
goal. And the place we're

42
00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.880
going is an area called
the kingdom of low, which

43
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.370
is right up against the
Tibet border. So it will

44
00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.160
be an incredible experience to
see it. And it is

45
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.270
part of the adventure. Wow.
Yeah. See, I've just exhausted

46
00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.680
to even think of that.
It's funny how I don't

47
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.020
know about you, but I
mean, I can't make travel

48
00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:00.100
plans unless I will. Well
rested. I find, I usually

49
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.640
Want to make travel plans
while traveling once I'm home

50
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:04.990
for a while, then I
don't want to make travel

51
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.950
plan. Oh yeah. I'm on,
I mean, I'm honestly on

52
00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.010
vacation right now. I'm on
a three week vacation and

53
00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.520
it's glorious. It's like, it's
like retirement. I mean, I

54
00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.150
have nothing to do. It's
awesome. Yeah. I don't know

55
00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.400
that feeling. I'm not good
at having nothing to do.

56
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.530
It never seems to work
for me. You're actually the

57
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.600
worst at that of all
the people. I know you

58
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.100
are the worst at vacation.
Well, once I got a

59
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.260
few weeks at home, which
is typically around this season,

60
00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.960
I mean, there's some shopping
to do some, you know,

61
00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.730
gifts to buy and so
forth. But mostly I've been

62
00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.560
servicing computers and doing spring
conference planning. And I mean,

63
00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.330
having a great time, I'm
doing all this stuff. I

64
00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.630
like, but they said not
having anything to do. I

65
00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.720
really don't understand it. It
can be. I'm still trying

66
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.460
to figure out what I
want to do when I

67
00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.430
can eventually do nothing. I
think it might be teaching

68
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.010
teaching at the high school
level. But then I understand

69
00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.180
that they work really hard.
So that's not good. I

70
00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.250
feel like I am retired,
which I think most people

71
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.170
would think is crazy, but
I only work on stuff.

72
00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.910
I really like. So isn't
that retirement. I have always

73
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.820
thought of retirement as being
just sleeping a lot and

74
00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:17.730
I like waiting to die.
I don't know. I think

75
00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.040
retirement is just nice having
enough money where you can

76
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.370
do whatever you want to
and presumably having enough money

77
00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.710
that your kids can do
whatever they want to. Now,

78
00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.270
when you wake up in
the morning and your bills

79
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.430
are already paid, that's a
good place to be. Yeah,

80
00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.000
absolutely. Absolutely. Like that place.
What a, what kind of

81
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.370
a gadget purchasing have you
been doing? Have you got

82
00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.920
any holiday gift giving ideas
for us? Shockingly Microsoft centric

83
00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.590
this year. I mean, when
phone seven, I'm in love

84
00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.480
with Now, you're not just
saying that because you are

85
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:50.280
a known Microsoft shell. I
am Microsoft shell. And, but

86
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.760
you know, what's been blew
my mind with the Samsung

87
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:57.300
focus was my daughters who
have iPhones are trying to

88
00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.530
steal them. I got one
for my wife and for

89
00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.930
me and they want them
and it, and I realized

90
00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:10.170
why it's the best Facebook
phone. I think Microsoft's missed

91
00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:13.410
and marketing opportunity here, makeup
pink phone, sell it to

92
00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:15.810
teenage girls. Didn't they do
that and call it the

93
00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:20.250
Canon and kill it. Yeah,
Yeah. But then that wasn't

94
00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.940
that good a phone. This
is a vastly superior phone.

95
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:28.320
And, and, but it's the,
the Facebook centric, miss of

96
00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.210
it is amazing. I mean,
the rest of it, it's

97
00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.270
just a, you know, a
good phone. It does all

98
00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.740
the things. Although I find
iPhone people, folks who are

99
00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.280
deeply into their iPhone, it's
still not good enough. That's

100
00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.460
it apps you missing? That's
the thing that You're, you

101
00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.420
you've actually nailed it because
people keep asking me what

102
00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.130
I think. And I, I
think I have a very

103
00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:52.920
complicated opinion because I'm a
Microsoft employee, which means that

104
00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.520
no one trusts me for
anything. I can't say anything

105
00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:57.950
about any, I haven't, I'm
not allowed to have an

106
00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:01.700
opinion about anything. There's something
in Microsoft word. And I've

107
00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:05.060
got a 3g, a three
GS and iPhone for an

108
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.090
iPad, blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah. You know, Steve jobs.

109
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:13.480
Yay. And You are, your
world is an iTunes centric.

110
00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.530
Actually it's a Zune centric
world from a music perspective.

111
00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.420
I'm all about the Zune.
And of course I'm not

112
00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:22.900
allowed to have that opinion
either I've stopped right? Throwing

113
00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.920
Steve money for, for music
a long time ago, I

114
00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:30.010
switched over to the, the
Zune pass and we have

115
00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:32.620
music streaming all over the
house and I got the

116
00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:36.700
zoon in the car and
blah, blah, blah. It's the

117
00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:40.300
leasing music is where it's
at and I'll buy. Cause

118
00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.950
you know, the deal with
the Zune, right? It's 15

119
00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:44.830
bucks a month and you
get 10 songs a month.

120
00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:46.900
So I can buy 10
songs, which is basically a

121
00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:49.930
CD and I can listen
to whatever I want to.

122
00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:52.330
So I listened to a
lot more music and I

123
00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:54.070
can experiment more because I
don't have to worry about,

124
00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.670
you know, actually paying, but
from an apps perspective, it's

125
00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:01.120
iPhones all the way You
try out a song, you

126
00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.040
know, as part of that
lease deal. And if you

127
00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.280
really like it, that's fine.
Exactly. You know, and that's,

128
00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:09.040
I think that's a great
model. And if I don't

129
00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.590
know where it zooms going,
but the model is what

130
00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:14.200
I'm talking about. And I
think that's wonderful. And his

131
00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:17.110
phone seven basically, I mean,
it is the Zune HD

132
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:20.740
with the phone chip set.
Exactly. It is a wonderful

133
00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:23.170
music player. And I actually,
I just got a thing

134
00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.710
called a tune link because
my car doesn't have Bluetooth

135
00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:29.440
audio. This is one of
the, one of the great

136
00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.930
failures of my life is
that the car that I

137
00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:35.560
just paid off, it doesn't
have Bluetooth audio. And that

138
00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.090
wire bugs the heck out
of me. So I bought

139
00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:40.960
this thing called a tune
link that takes your existing

140
00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.860
car with its auxiliary audio
in and then makes it

141
00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:48.430
a Bluetooth audio device, which
is wonderful. So it's, it's

142
00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:51.610
the host end of a
Bluetooth audio connection Please. So,

143
00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:55.180
you know, I opened up
the glove compartment and I

144
00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:59.170
hide this, this little cigarette,
lighter looking thing in the

145
00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:01.870
car and plug it into
the ox and I've got

146
00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:05.260
Bluetooth audio and I just
named it Mazda audio. So

147
00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.480
I can make my Mazda
feel better about it stuff,

148
00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:09.280
you know, kind of feels
like I upgraded the car

149
00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:12.550
and then the windows phone,
seven streams, Bluetooth directly from

150
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:15.760
zoom as well as last
FM and all that kind

151
00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.560
of stuff. So I, I
listened to whatever the heck

152
00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.990
I want to whenever I
want to, without wires in

153
00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:22.840
the car. So, you know,
happiness and love all around.

154
00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:25.510
But what you just said
was so interesting is that

155
00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:28.990
if you're really, really deeply
into your iPhone, if you're

156
00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:32.860
like a power user, it's
you, you, you can't accept

157
00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:37.240
the windows, phone seven as
being so amazing. Yeah. It

158
00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.430
is a great phone And
it's funny, the things that

159
00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:42.970
matter. So I mean, I've
played with every phone seven

160
00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:45.070
out there for, you know,
one way or the other,

161
00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:46.420
had a chance to get
my hands on it. And

162
00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:50.170
I've realized that the Samsung
focus catches you with it's

163
00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:56.220
screen, Oh, led style screen.
It's super. And you, and

164
00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:58.170
it's, I, you know, I'm
getting better and better at

165
00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:01.350
when I hand the phone
to someone watch their expressions.

166
00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:03.930
And when that screen first
comes on and it's so

167
00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:07.440
bright and crest, you get
that little, Oh, they literally

168
00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:11.970
sort of pop backward. And
that, and I realized actually

169
00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:14.220
now it's like the first
impression of fact you got

170
00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.410
them, they're already done. I
know they're going to love

171
00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:20.150
it. The, the screen on
the focus is so clear

172
00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:22.460
and I figured out what
it is. It's the black,

173
00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:26.660
black part of the screen
is so pure black that

174
00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:28.760
you can't tell where the
screen stops and where the,

175
00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:33.620
the rest of the bezel
ends. Yeah. It's a good

176
00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:36.470
trick. And it's, it's subtle,
isn't it? These little things

177
00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:39.440
they've done. Yeah. I found
the HD seven, which has

178
00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:44.090
got a 4.3 inch screen
just too big. Really? Yeah.

179
00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:46.760
It's just a little, the
difference between there there's some

180
00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:49.070
that are made at 3.8,
some are made at four,

181
00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:52.400
like the focus and some
are 4.3, 4.3 is too

182
00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:55.160
big. That's a sh does
that fit in your back

183
00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:58.190
pocket? That's a huge screen.
All right. You wouldn't wanna

184
00:09:58.190 --> 00:09:59.450
put it in your back
pocket. Cause then you'll sit

185
00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:03.290
down on it and you'll
snap it in half. Yeah.

186
00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:05.180
You know, there's rumors of
like six and seven inch

187
00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:07.400
devices around and I've, you
know, for, for me, a

188
00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.710
phone has to fit in
your back pocket. It just

189
00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:13.560
has to yeah. Or your
inside jacket pocket And I

190
00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:16.310
carry a six inch device,
but it's my Kindle. You

191
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:22.160
carry your Kindle. Yeah, absolutely.
Wow. She, you know, the

192
00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.280
thing that, that makes a
device integrate into my life

193
00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:28.340
is the ability to pick
up, start using it immediately

194
00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:31.220
and then have it come
with me without the device

195
00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:34.780
coming with me. So for
example, I'll, I'll read my

196
00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:37.430
Kindle lives in one place.
It lives in my room,

197
00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:41.780
on my nightstand. I'll read
it, I'll put it down.

198
00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:44.360
I'll go somewhere. And then
I'll pick up my iPhone

199
00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.640
and I'll run the Kindle
app. And my page is

200
00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:49.790
exactly where I left it.
So the Kindles with it.

201
00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:51.110
Yeah. We do the same
thing. But with two different

202
00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:53.030
Kindles, I have a Kindle
for the road and a

203
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:56.390
Kindle at my reading spot
in the living room. Oh,

204
00:10:56.390 --> 00:11:01.250
well that's just excessive. Well,
I lost one on an

205
00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:03.980
airplane. Did you know about,
did you hear about my

206
00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:06.770
Kindle on an airplane story?
Yeah. I remember I remember

207
00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:09.470
the dual tweet stream when
you got it Back. Yeah.

208
00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.330
I lost it and I
got it back. The airline

209
00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:13.640
employees found it for me
and ironically, they didn't know

210
00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:16.880
what it was. It was
bizarre. They didn't know what

211
00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:19.130
it was. And I had
to explain to them, it

212
00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:22.320
almost got thrown away just
because it was just this

213
00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:25.820
strange white device. I'm surprised
that that even the guy

214
00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:27.830
who handed it to me,
didn't quite understand what was

215
00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:32.510
going on. This was in
Munich, Germany. This was before

216
00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:35.600
the international Kindle. So presumably
they weren't as popular. They

217
00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.640
just weren't known out there.
Well, mine came back through

218
00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:39.860
regular channels, but it took
three weeks. And in the

219
00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:42.500
meantime I couldn't live without
my Kindle. So I got

220
00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:47.870
another one. That's awesome. I
just have a short attention

221
00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:49.610
span, man. Like I was
literally in the middle of

222
00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:51.410
a great book and I'd
left it on the plane.

223
00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:53.860
Yeah, no, I had to
get another plugged into the

224
00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:55.780
same account. All the same
books picked up where I

225
00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:59.850
left off. That's pretty sweet.
I did that. I upgraded

226
00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:03.660
my Kindle from the, the
what number are they on

227
00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:06.630
now? Kendall three, three. Yeah.
I took a, I sold

228
00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:09.870
my two. I got my
three and I just said,

229
00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:12.360
you know, sink books. And
they were all there. Yup.

230
00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:14.940
And that's what our device
fits into my life where,

231
00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:17.850
you know, the device has
one foot in the cloud,

232
00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:20.850
so it just works. You
know, that's one of the

233
00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:23.100
things I'd like to see
the Xbox too, because I,

234
00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:29.070
I almost, I almost washed
my Xbox memory card yesterday.

235
00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:31.710
It was in a, in
a pocket of the M

236
00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:33.720
jeans pocket kind of thing.
Yeah. Well, cause with the

237
00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:36.780
Xbox, one of the things
that's unfortunate is that your

238
00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:39.990
windows live pass or your
windows live, you know, account

239
00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:43.710
can only live in one
place. You have to copy

240
00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:47.190
it from the X-Box to
a memory key to another

241
00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:50.010
Xbox I, and you have
two Kindles. I have two

242
00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:54.420
X, X box. And so
I, I keep my memory,

243
00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:59.640
my memory key loaded with
my past, with my Xbox

244
00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:02.750
live account. So I move
it between my office and

245
00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:05.190
in the living room. And
then one day it was

246
00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:08.550
gone and I sat there
for a second and tried

247
00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:11.250
to like, you know, absorb
the wisdom of the universe

248
00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:15.510
and realize that it was
in my breast pocket. And

249
00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:17.730
I remember that because I
never put anything in my

250
00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:21.750
chest pocket. And I just
ran, ran, ran to the,

251
00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:27.180
the, the washing queue and
found it. And it was

252
00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:31.590
like, it's like one of
those cartoons where something is

253
00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:34.500
on a conveyor belt and
headed towards, you know, a

254
00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:40.470
certain doom. My, my memory
card was in the, in

255
00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:43.290
the shirt headed towards the
washer, headed towards certain doom.

256
00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:46.470
I rescued it. That's a
perfect example where that's cheating.

257
00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:48.150
That needs to be in
the cloud. There's no reason

258
00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:50.220
for me to have to
run around, looking for memory

259
00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:52.650
card, plus one day it's
going to die. And then

260
00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:55.080
I am going to be,
Yeah, inevitably it'll fail. You

261
00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:57.770
know, when I've gotten into
a mindset now where I've,

262
00:13:57.770 --> 00:14:01.680
I've realized that SDS and
CFS are damaged by flying

263
00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:06.210
in airplanes, I lose at
least one a year. Wow.

264
00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:08.340
I kill a fair number
of telephones that way too.

265
00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:11.040
So I've got a lot
of dead, dead cell phones

266
00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:15.030
from cosmic rays, really where
I get off the plane

267
00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:18.060
and something's broken on the
phone. You said something about

268
00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:20.220
that to me, once you,
you said that you have

269
00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:24.840
this thing where you kill
devices, like the radiation or

270
00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:27.540
something you observed it, It's
always the same time. It's

271
00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:29.970
when I get off the
plane, that's crazy. I go

272
00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:32.600
to use the phone and
something's broken and it's not

273
00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:35.910
the phone's completely dead. It's
some of the screens garbled

274
00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:40.260
or the Bluetooth doesn't work
anymore. Or it's something I

275
00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.260
think I just fly too
much. That's all. Well, there

276
00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:46.680
is a lot of, of
radiation for flying. I mean,

277
00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:48.960
you're absorbing a lot and
if you're flying all day

278
00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:52.040
long, you're definitely paying for
it. It's free. You know,

279
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.930
There is a cost to
flying that much. So it's

280
00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:57.620
not on phones. It's also
hard on CA CFS and

281
00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:59.810
SDS and every soften. I
just have them. I'm done.

282
00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:01.730
I'm just supporting your, your
point here sooner or later,

283
00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:04.700
that card is going to
die. Yeah. It's not immortal.

284
00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:08.920
Hi, this is Scott coming
to you from another place

285
00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:12.040
in time. Are you using
agile practices to manage your

286
00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:14.320
software development? There's lots of
tools in the market that

287
00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:16.330
manage the steps of a
project, but most of them

288
00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:19.540
focus on individual roles. Get
ready for a solution that

289
00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:21.970
caters for the success of
the whole team. Guys at

290
00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:26.080
Tellerik introduced team pulse. It's
an agile project management tool.

291
00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:29.470
That'll help you gather ideas,
estimate plan, track progress in

292
00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:33.310
a common workspace. Finally companies,
regardless of their size can

293
00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:35.230
use a lightweight and convenient
tool that makes all the

294
00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:38.590
stakeholders work as a United
team. Even if they're in

295
00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:42.160
different countries by combining intuitive
user interface and the power

296
00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:45.040
server light team poles removes
the roadblocks that you typically

297
00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:48.130
face and applying agile in
an effective manner, no more

298
00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:52.120
lost data, no disparate systems,
no lack of critical analytics

299
00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:55.870
regarding the health philosophy project.

303
00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:13.960
K Tellerik. We do appreciate
it. There wouldn't be a

304
00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:17.440
Hansel minutes. If there wasn't,
Tellerik helping us, You know

305
00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:22.240
what? I'm frustrated with the
X-Box ecosystem. It's things like

306
00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:25.030
that that are, we have
known solutions for like, it

307
00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:28.960
doesn't need to be on
a card, but also why

308
00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:33.280
isn't that game app store
working? This, this should be

309
00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:36.640
a good little business for
people building small games for

310
00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:40.060
the Xbox that people can
buy through their X-Box and

311
00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:44.050
enjoy The indie games stuff
works. I had, I had

312
00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:47.140
a George Klinger man on
last a couple of weeks

313
00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:49.660
ago and he, you know,
he has a nice little

314
00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:52.870
slick thing going on a
X-Box. I mean, it's actually

315
00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:56.920
a tab on Xbox called
indie games. Yeah. You don't

316
00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:58.900
think that works. I mean,
I'm aware of it. I

317
00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:00.940
just don't know how many
people are actually using it.

318
00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:03.970
I can't find anybody who's
buying and selling games in

319
00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:07.690
that form. Well, I think
that's actually the app store

320
00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:11.590
problem at in fact yes.
What you're describing, isn't an

321
00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:16.090
Xbox issue. It's the, the
world's app stores are glutted.

322
00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:18.880
I remember someone saying once
that an eye, the eye

323
00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:23.110
on the average iPhone application
makes about $2,000. Yeah. Right.

324
00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:25.270
It's just the whole long
tail effect for every angry

325
00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:30.190
birds. There's like 15,000 fart
applications. Yeah. Now we're in

326
00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:34.960
the Hollywood model, you know,
0.1% of these apps are

327
00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:37.930
going to be hugely successful
and that will put enough

328
00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:41.170
stars in people's eyes that
they'll keep trying to have

329
00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:45.430
that one big mega hit.
What is that one mega

330
00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:46.960
hit and the amount of,
you know, the amount of

331
00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:48.820
work they always, they always
make it seem like it's

332
00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:50.160
going to easy, but the
amount of work and a

333
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.810
mega hit is just crazy.
Huge. But the, the other

334
00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:57.050
thing that interests me about
angry birds is the marketing

335
00:17:57.050 --> 00:18:00.050
model that, you know, you
can't sell anything in the

336
00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:02.390
app store, the app store.
By the time someone goes

337
00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:03.920
to the app store, they've
got to already be sold.

338
00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:09.980
It's done really. Cause cause
curation is a disaster. You

339
00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:13.430
can't find anything. Yeah. And
every app store has that

340
00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:16.520
problem. You know, his wind
phone, seven's racing towards this

341
00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:19.130
problem right now. And I've,
and I've been saying and

342
00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:21.560
been yelled at for being
so negative. It's like a

343
00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:27.170
hundred thousand apps is a
disaster because it's completely unmanageable.

344
00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:29.570
Nobody's shown me a solution
to manage that many apps.

345
00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:34.040
Yeah. Yeah. It's extremely demotivating
actually. Have you written any

346
00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:36.380
applications, have you thought about
jumping into the whole app

347
00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:40.010
store thing? I've done a
lot of research working with

348
00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:43.640
different teams around the different
app stores and seen this

349
00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:45.710
problem over and over again
and recognize the marketing has

350
00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:48.770
to be entirely external. And
I believe that what I've

351
00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:50.540
read so far by the
angry birds is totally word

352
00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:52.730
of mouth sale. You know,
how do you sell angry

353
00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:56.360
birds by having someone play
angry birds? Is that an

354
00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:58.190
app store thing or is
that just life now? I

355
00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:00.380
mean, from my point of
view, everything is word of

356
00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:03.290
mouth. Like for example, my
parents are buying a blue

357
00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:07.220
Ray player and their number
one source of information about

358
00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:11.390
the blue Ray player is
the reviews on Amazon. So

359
00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:13.370
that means that there is
no marketing anymore. There is

360
00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:19.160
only be awesome. Yep. Right.
Be also only the social

361
00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:23.780
constructs. How do I get
people to talk about my

362
00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:26.990
product, Which is, which is
a good system, except maybe

363
00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:28.940
there's just too many products
and too many people, right.

364
00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:33.500
This implies that people need
to stop. Like you're not

365
00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:35.150
going to be angry birds.
So maybe you should just

366
00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:38.360
stop. What do you think
about that? I tend to

367
00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:42.440
agree. So on another, here's
a whole other layer of

368
00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:47.960
that exact same conversation talking
to associates of mine that

369
00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:51.050
are in the large scale
game industry and let's face

370
00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:52.730
it. There's only a few
companies in this space. So

371
00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:55.340
it's probably pretty apparent who
I'm talking about and them

372
00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:59.570
realizing they make 20, they
can make 25 games a

373
00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:02.150
year with the infrastructure they've
got and five of them

374
00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:05.090
will be hit. And they've
got pretty good formulas now

375
00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:06.800
around understanding which one of
those fives is going to

376
00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:10.250
be. So they're simply cutting
back teams. They're making fewer

377
00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:18.480
products because the other 20
aren't worth the effort. Well,

378
00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:20.930
but that gets into the
commoditization of everything. That just

379
00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:23.510
means that they're certainly they're
focusing on the moneymaker, but

380
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:25.850
at the same time there
is money and just turning

381
00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:28.370
out this crap. I said,
well, this is the long

382
00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:30.290
tail mindset, but it's, you
know, the problem when you

383
00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:32.870
talk about commercial game development
is that it's a million

384
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:35.210
dollar plus proposition. There's so
many people that work on

385
00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:38.150
a game in that infrastructure
that it's just not, you

386
00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:43.130
can't throw that money away.
Yeah. Yeah. And I think

387
00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:45.890
this is why we're seeing
the what's interesting to me

388
00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:49.060
about the iPhone app is
this the first time in

389
00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:50.860
a number of years that
two guys in a garage

390
00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:54.490
could make a program that
sells for a long time.

391
00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:57.760
That business model was basically
dead right now. Now it's

392
00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:01.360
back, it's these casual games
and casual apps that run

393
00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:04.240
on phones, but you still
have a gold rush kind

394
00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:07.000
of mentality. You still have,
you know, one in a

395
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.840
thousand or one in 10,001
in 100,000 are going to

396
00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:13.630
be wildly successful and everybody
else is just slugging it

397
00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:15.720
out. Do you think that
that model is going to

398
00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:18.840
transfer over to the, the
web cause I've been playing

399
00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:23.550
with the Chrome web store
and you know, well, it's

400
00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:25.920
interesting in, in cool. I
don't know if I want

401
00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:28.350
to pay 99 cents on my
PC. I mean, I've been

402
00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:30.540
sitting in front of my
PC for 20 years, not

403
00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:33.750
paying 99 cents. I think what
worked about the app store

404
00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:36.270
on the phone was I
haven't spent the last 20

405
00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:40.320
years in Starbucks on a
tiny device and you know,

406
00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:44.730
board and I'll spend 99 cents.
But when I sit down

407
00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:47.610
in front of my big
giant PC surfing the web

408
00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:51.060
for free, and then suddenly
a, an application store makes

409
00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:54.030
me wants to charge me
99 cents to effectively make a

410
00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:59.640
bookmark. I get a little
bit less enthusiastic. Well, it's

411
00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:02.280
amazing how much resistance there
is around the 99 cents sale.

412
00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:05.370
Isn't there. I mean, it's
like I spend five times

413
00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:08.040
that on my latte, but
I don't want to spend

414
00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:11.520
99 cents on this app in
the phone, but you'll go

415
00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:14.070
back to your extra question
on the PC side, their

416
00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:17.260
steam. I don't know if
you're a steam subscriber, The

417
00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:21.420
steam steam is the valve
software application for it's basically

418
00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:24.000
the it's the game. It
is the games app store,

419
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.160
I would say on the
PC. Yeah. And has been

420
00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:28.590
for a year and predates
the iPhone app store. Like

421
00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:30.810
this has been there for
years and years. And the

422
00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:33.720
big thing about steam Munis
gets right back to our

423
00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:36.210
conversation on the Kindle and
so forth is I blow

424
00:22:36.210 --> 00:22:38.160
up machines on a regular
basis and rebuild them. And

425
00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:40.530
as soon as I install
steam put in my account

426
00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:45.180
information, there are my games.
Oh yeah, no flipping disks,

427
00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:49.290
no downloading, no looking for
product keys. The stuff's there.

428
00:22:49.290 --> 00:22:52.470
It's through one portal for
everything. And now I just

429
00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:53.700
won't buy a game if
I can't get it on

430
00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:56.100
steam. It's crazy too, to
try and buy anything any

431
00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:59.970
other way. I also think
that the steam guys, valve

432
00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:02.070
guys have done a really
great job of rolling up

433
00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:05.430
old titles because we're all
getting older and nostalgic, I

434
00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:09.240
picked up all the old
EXCOMM games for $20, five

435
00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:13.980
games. Not that I've played
them at all. Right. But

436
00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:16.200
I just felt good about
owning ex-com again, because I

437
00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:18.600
found the old box somewhere
and it's on three and

438
00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:20.430
a half inch media and
I don't even think I

439
00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:23.160
have one of those drives
anymore. And then I was

440
00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:25.830
able to get them on
steam. Yeah. I think that's

441
00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:30.180
steam is definitely was ahead
of its time. I mean,

442
00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:31.890
it w it, it continues
to be like kind of

443
00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:34.050
the perfect model. I mean,
it has its technical problems,

444
00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:38.220
but you're right. It's, it's
totally cloud based. It just

445
00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:42.120
works. It's it is the
app just works, but I

446
00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:43.650
don't feel like they're nickel
and diming me. It's at

447
00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:46.370
99 cents. You know, they're, they're
always trying to find that

448
00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:49.940
perfect price. And we all
know the psychological effects of

449
00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:52.670
like two 99. What do
you mean two 99? That's

450
00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:56.000
insane. Who would pay two
99 that's too much, but

451
00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.520
then 99 cents is just small
enough that it's starting to

452
00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:03.280
feel like death by a
thousand cuts. Well, I know

453
00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:05.920
you don't care so much
of the problem. Faith popcorn

454
00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:08.590
did this. Anything under $20
is effectively free. You'll just

455
00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:12.160
buy it. So then the
question is value and the

456
00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:16.480
pro 99 cents is so low.
You question value, but I

457
00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:20.950
bought flight control HD on
steam for my PC, even

458
00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:26.590
though it is a phone
game for two 99. Really?

459
00:24:27.490 --> 00:24:29.320
Yeah. But I think anything
under the price of a

460
00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:32.800
latte, why would you think
about it? But, you know,

461
00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:34.420
I think you're more comfortable
there than you are at

462
00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:40.630
99 cents. Okay. Well, let's think
about this, this way. The

463
00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:45.430
game is at least a
game. It is understood and

464
00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:48.760
it is finite and it
is a game. Yeah. But

465
00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:50.830
you know, am I going
to spend 99 cents for an

466
00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:54.970
HTML five based canvas icon
editor? You know, I'm just

467
00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:57.370
so used to, to book
things on the web places

468
00:24:57.370 --> 00:25:01.990
I visit not costing me.
Right. I'm not enthusiastic to

469
00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:05.230
do that. And I, and
I don't, I think that

470
00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:08.530
model is not going to
succeed. The customer base is

471
00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:11.320
also tricky. You know, we're,
we're never the customer, we're

472
00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:14.740
the odd docs. What we're
interested in, what we care

473
00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:16.960
about, how we perceive value,
what we know is hard

474
00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:18.520
and easy. We look at
it totally different than the

475
00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:22.900
customer does. And, and so
I would never want to

476
00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:26.140
sell to us Well that,
that, and then that kind

477
00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:28.810
of gets back to the
whole discussion at the beginning

478
00:25:28.810 --> 00:25:30.970
of the, of the, of
the half an hour here,

479
00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:34.810
talking about windows, phone seven.
I mean, I love it.

480
00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:37.690
It's beautiful. It's a wonderful
thing, but I don't think

481
00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:40.510
I'm the target audience. You're
not, I actually had an

482
00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:43.780
interesting discussion with a lady
in line at Qdoba or

483
00:25:43.790 --> 00:25:47.500
the local taco place. And
she, I, she said, you

484
00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:48.850
know, I'm a little bummed.
She has, she had a

485
00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:51.070
phone, I noticed her windows
phone seven. So I said,

486
00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:53.230
Hey, this is a nice
phone. She says, yeah. But,

487
00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:56.170
you know, I thought I
would want copy paste. And

488
00:25:56.170 --> 00:25:59.200
then she said, you know,
but who needs copy paste?

489
00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:03.040
And it was weird to
have an actual human in,

490
00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:06.430
in the public, not just
a Microsoft person say who

491
00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:09.820
needs to copy paste and
say it with a straight

492
00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:11.380
face and really believe Well.
And it's one of those

493
00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:13.450
things where I've now, they've
now used the phone for

494
00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:15.220
a month and not missed
it. Yeah. Yeah. She used

495
00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:16.750
it to a fault. Yeah.
But there, which means she's

496
00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:19.570
not a power user. Yeah.
Right. She's never shared a

497
00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:21.640
link on Twitter and of
course, copy paste is coming.

498
00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:23.590
I guess they said, it's
coming in January or something.

499
00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:27.790
I have no doubt that
they're going to upgrade the

500
00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:29.710
phone and it's going to
get crazier and crazier. And

501
00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:31.300
then things are going to
get really interesting. It's, it's,

502
00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:36.100
it's pretty clear that they're
absolutely where the iPhone was

503
00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:39.010
early on and they're going
to upgrade and upgrade and

504
00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:42.430
upgrade this thing at a
faster speed than the iPhone

505
00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:46.320
did so that it catches
up, you know, but the,

506
00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:48.660
when she said, who, who
needs copy paste? Anyway, I

507
00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:53.750
just knew that I'm not
the target audience. Right. That's

508
00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:56.120
true. Because, you know, I
want to quad process or

509
00:26:56.120 --> 00:27:00.440
phone, You know, the duals
were coming arm is now

510
00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:03.800
manufacturing a dual core processor
in the form format. That

511
00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:06.400
means it's going to happen.
It's going to happen. I,

512
00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:09.890
I fully expect the next
generation of, of windows, phone

513
00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:11.900
hardware to be dual core
probably by the end of

514
00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:15.050
next year. Really. You know,
the thing that I think

515
00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:18.860
is interesting about all of
this mobile stuff, isn't necessarily

516
00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:21.380
the app store, but it
is changing the programming model.

517
00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:23.390
I think it's starting to
make people aware of low

518
00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:28.310
power States of suspending, of
tombstone, of even the benefit

519
00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:32.330
of Fullscreen. I, you know,
that Jeff Atwood from coding

520
00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:36.410
horror has, has long suggested
that we, we run our

521
00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:40.310
applications in full screen. He
doesn't like window management, you

522
00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:42.200
know, he just, you know,
an app either is a

523
00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:44.960
Fullscreen app, or maybe it's
a half a screen. So

524
00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:47.450
he prefers that kind of
tile, all windows way of

525
00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:51.680
doing things. Yeah. But I
think, well, it, again, it

526
00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:55.040
gets into power users do
things differently. I stack many,

527
00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:56.540
many more windows and I've
got the, you know, the

528
00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:59.960
monster 49, 60 by 1600
screen. You do not want

529
00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:04.280
to expand anything over all
those screens. Yeah. Certainly, certainly.

530
00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:09.290
But with multiple monitors and
Fullscreen applications. Yeah. You know,

531
00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:12.050
I find the multitasking on
the iPad to be a

532
00:28:12.050 --> 00:28:15.860
little bit tedious. Yeah. I,
I, it's a little bit

533
00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:20.030
slow. It's not quite all
tab fast enough, but the

534
00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:24.950
single tasking focus of, of
a full screen application combined

535
00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:27.530
with some of the, the
speed of multitasking on a

536
00:28:27.530 --> 00:28:30.380
PC, you know, I just,
let me just say, I

537
00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:34.010
spend a lot of time
shoving windows around and resize

538
00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:35.810
and stuff that I don't
feel I should need to.

539
00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:41.900
Yeah. I'm a minimizer minimize.
I tend, I actually click

540
00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:43.640
on the button, says minimize
everything and then go pick

541
00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:47.720
up the one window I
care about. But again, we're

542
00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:50.510
not the, We're not the
audience. I watch my wife

543
00:28:50.510 --> 00:28:54.590
do it. She's a maximizer.
One window covers the whole

544
00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:58.670
screen. She has two monitors.
They each have a window

545
00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:01.760
covering their whole screen. Yeah.
Well see then that, that

546
00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:03.590
gets into it. Doesn't it?
I mean, you've kind of

547
00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:07.070
nailed it. Right. They're watching
how they do it. And

548
00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:09.950
it's annoying to me, you
know, there's the shared kitchen

549
00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:13.280
PC, what are we doing
with a maximized IAE window

550
00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:16.190
on a, you know, 1920
by 1200 screen. That's the

551
00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:19.850
same. And I'm making windows
smaller and she maximizes them

552
00:29:19.850 --> 00:29:22.790
all. Yeah. Yeah. And she,
when she met my, my

553
00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:24.500
wife has the same thing
with our kitchen PC and

554
00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:27.680
she maximizes the, the browser
as well. So I've just

555
00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:30.440
started hitting control plus just
to make the font bigger,

556
00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:37.400
to justify all those pixels.
Very large. Yeah. I mean,

557
00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:39.260
otherwise it's a huge waste,
right. I mean, I even

558
00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:41.410
start, I'm even starting to
do that with my, my

559
00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:44.670
30 inch monitor just to
control plus make everything bigger,

560
00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:48.490
lean back and pretend that
I'm browsing it 2024. There

561
00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:52.020
you go. Yeah. Icons the
size of your fist. Yeah.

562
00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:54.630
In fact, in fact icons
as big as your fist.

563
00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:58.020
Well, this was a minutia
show I've ever, I've seen

564
00:29:58.020 --> 00:29:59.880
a show. Where's your camera.
Oh yeah. Well, you know,

565
00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:02.040
the one gadget we haven't
talked about is the connect.

566
00:30:02.370 --> 00:30:04.290
Did you get a connect?
Let me guess. You have

567
00:30:04.290 --> 00:30:05.970
to, if you lost one
and you bought one, cause

568
00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:08.910
you couldn't live without it.
No, I haven't lost any

569
00:30:08.910 --> 00:30:10.800
yet, but I think we're
going to end up with

570
00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:14.010
multiple connects in our lives.
I really want to Mount

571
00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:17.730
it to my, to my
PC. Absolutely. What do you

572
00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:19.830
want to do with it
on your PC? Honestly, I

573
00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:22.860
just want to swipe left
and right to move windows

574
00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:26.080
from one monitor to the
next. There you go. That's

575
00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:29.040
just a small thing to
ask. I think I should

576
00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:30.960
build a Ute by existing
webcam though. And that's the

577
00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:35.640
thing. I don't truly understand
the connect hardware. So I,

578
00:30:35.730 --> 00:30:38.010
I can't say what it,
what it does or doesn't

579
00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:40.640
do. And what else Got
a webcam on it? Little,

580
00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:44.070
not a particularly good one.
And it's got the infrared

581
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:49.770
3d mapper and it's got
directional microphones And presumably some

582
00:30:49.770 --> 00:30:54.390
hardware inside, some kind of
a, I don't know something

583
00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:57.060
that is doing some of
the processing. I don't think

584
00:30:57.060 --> 00:31:03.060
it's just two webcams. Yeah.
There is some logic going

585
00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:05.910
on there. Although there's conversations
happening about the stress, it

586
00:31:05.910 --> 00:31:09.270
puts on an Xbox really.
I think it's saying Couple

587
00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:13.050
of percentage Larger than that
enough that it's, you know,

588
00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:19.410
impacting Xbox. Sure. Look at,
you know, the, the, my

589
00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:22.590
best idea for why you'd
have that connect built into

590
00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:27.120
a monitor is the ultimate,
you know, boss feature that

591
00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:28.770
I can set a group
policy in place with this

592
00:31:28.770 --> 00:31:30.780
particular app can only be
seen by one person. If

593
00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:34.020
another face appears in the
view, it just blacks out

594
00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:40.020
the screen. Hmm. I've had,
I've had, I have not

595
00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:42.360
had that experience. I've had
experiences where it couldn't see

596
00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:46.080
my kids. I don't know
if they were too little

597
00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:49.230
or what I've had experiences
where I'm waving at problems

598
00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:53.880
and it's like, hello? He
doesn't know I'm there. No

599
00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:55.740
I'm saying that's a feature
I want to put in.

600
00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:58.110
We know why do we
want them on our PCs?

601
00:31:58.110 --> 00:32:00.450
Cause you can now use
them as a security device,

602
00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:05.130
but there's a whole other
set of mapping rules. Once

603
00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:08.130
you're working in that three
foot distance. Now you're no

604
00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:12.420
longer looking at arms and
legs so much as shoulders

605
00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:14.790
and faces and things like
that. I'm wondering if we

606
00:32:14.790 --> 00:32:19.320
could eventually build a class
that using the connect features

607
00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:22.740
could determine the emotional state
of the users. Oh yeah.

608
00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:28.320
I frustrated is this guy
research onto that and actually

609
00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:31.980
connect the moles with the
animal game. It's like a

610
00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:35.340
pet animal game does jam
some of that emotional state

611
00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:39.500
stuff based on posture and,
and face. And apparently the

612
00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:44.540
animal tries to show empathy.
Right. It's happening. I mean,

613
00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:48.550
they're getting close to doing
that now. Yeah. But I

614
00:32:48.550 --> 00:32:52.210
just think, thinking about how
I would build software, where

615
00:32:52.210 --> 00:32:53.860
I could respond to the
fact that I can tell

616
00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:56.410
my users getting frustrated, like
how would I change the

617
00:32:56.410 --> 00:32:59.890
behavior of my app? Deal
with a frustrated. Yeah. That

618
00:32:59.890 --> 00:33:02.830
gets dangerously into Clippy territory
where you frown. And then

619
00:33:02.830 --> 00:33:05.740
flip is like, looks like
you're mad at me. Yeah.

620
00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:08.350
Others go, yeah. This now
he pops up. Immediately goes,

621
00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:09.790
Oh, you don't want to
see me and pops away

622
00:33:09.790 --> 00:33:13.210
again. You don't have to
click on anything. It looks

623
00:33:13.210 --> 00:33:14.560
like you don't want to
hear from me. And then

624
00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:17.470
it goes away immediately. I'm
not even going to go

625
00:33:17.470 --> 00:33:21.580
there where if I could
actually see elation, when the

626
00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:24.700
popup comes, then I'm like,
Oh, I'm glad I'm here.

627
00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:28.540
How can I help you?
I don't think our LaFace

628
00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:30.520
is usually light up when
Clippy shows up on our

629
00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:34.720
screen. Yeah. Not, not at
our audience anyway, that I

630
00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:38.050
presume you're looking at all
the cool videos of stuff

631
00:33:38.050 --> 00:33:39.430
that people are doing with
the cadet. You see the

632
00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:40.960
one where the guy put
the connect on the quad

633
00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:47.560
copter? No. So he's actually
flying around. He's got a

634
00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:50.620
connect that's flying. It's it's
very close to, you know,

635
00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:53.560
Hunter killers from Terminator is
here's a machine flying around

636
00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:55.810
and they'd look at the
view through the three D

637
00:33:55.810 --> 00:33:57.790
camera and it can find
the floor and the closest

638
00:33:57.790 --> 00:34:01.150
object, everything, but recognizing John
Connor and trying to shoot

639
00:34:01.150 --> 00:34:04.260
him. Oh my goodness. Yeah.
I need to, sorry. I

640
00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:06.070
need to start hacking. I
need to take my connect

641
00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:08.130
and plug it into my
PC and start seeing what

642
00:34:08.350 --> 00:34:10.930
kind of trouble I can
get into. There's a code

643
00:34:10.930 --> 00:34:14.500
Plex project called N connect.
Yeah. Yeah. That's my buddy

644
00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:18.370
Boris in Mexico about that.
Got them booked for a

645
00:34:18.370 --> 00:34:21.400
dotnet rocks. Very cool. Very
cool. I want to check

646
00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:24.850
that out. All right. Well
thank you so much, Richard Campbell

647
00:34:24.850 --> 00:34:27.820
for, for sitting here. This
may be, this may be

648
00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:30.460
the, the first cancer minutes.
Did we waste their time?

649
00:34:30.490 --> 00:34:33.310
Remember I promise not to
waste your time. You promised.

650
00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:36.130
I think there are, there
are those people who wait

651
00:34:36.130 --> 00:34:39.010
all year for a bigger
campus. And then there were

652
00:34:39.010 --> 00:34:44.020
those people who are like,
Oh Yep. Well, I appreciate

653
00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:46.930
you. I thank you very
much. Thanks. It's always good

654
00:34:46.930 --> 00:34:49.960
to talk to you. There's
been another episode of Hansel

655
00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:51.760
minutes. See you again next
week.
