When you need to focus
on building, do you want

2
00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.070
to get bogged down by
your database? Mongo DB is

3
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.860
an intuitive, flexible document database
that lets you get to

4
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.520
building Mongo. DBS document model
is a natural way to

5
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.730
represent data so you can
focus on what matters. Mongo

6
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.490
DB Atlas is the best
way to use Mongo DB.

7
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.430
It's a global cloud database
service that gives you all

8
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.640
of the developer productivity of
Mongo DB. Plus the added

9
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.120
simplicity of a fully managed
database service you can get

10
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:47.240
started free with Mongo DB
atlas@mongodb.com slash Atlas. Hi, this

11
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.330
is Scott Hanselman. This is
Hansel minutes today. I'm talking

12
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.150
with Kevi McMahon. She's a
software engineer. She's worked on

13
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.790
product and technical challenges for
a number of years and

14
00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.000
she's led significant engineering projects
at get hub, including kid

15
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.030
hub apps. How are you?
I'm good, Scott. Thanks for

16
00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.530
having me on. Yeah, I
found your blog at <inaudible>

17
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.200
dot com K E a
V Y. And you've got

18
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.570
a number of really great
blog posts. They all kind

19
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.450
of have a theme. You
talk about building bridges as

20
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.000
a technical leader. And one
of my favorites is called

21
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.500
thriving on the technical leadership
path. Since we're not really

22
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.930
early in career people, I
don't think it's appropriate anymore

23
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.060
to say junior or senior
there's early in career. There's

24
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.300
maybe later in career or
more senior, I assume that

25
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.320
you were maybe a CTO
or you were the chief

26
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.440
engineer, but you are, you
don't have an org that

27
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.760
works for you, right? You
don't have a team of

28
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.750
10 engineers, do you? Oh
wow. No, I wish I

29
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.710
know. I just an IC,
I don't, I don't have

30
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.310
a team. I work with
a bunch of teams 20

31
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.160
years into a career. They
keep kind of poke you

32
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.170
and say, well, Hey, here's
a team here. And suddenly

33
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.580
the next thing you know,
you're a manager and you're

34
00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.500
just like, and then you
always hear the person that

35
00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.200
says, well, I used to
be technical. How did you

36
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.000
keep that from happening? Yeah.
I had a short stint

37
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.450
as being an engineering manager
a few years ago and

38
00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.140
I was sort of reluctantly
tried it out and I

39
00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.390
was already a tech lead
for a project that I

40
00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.040
really cared a lot about
it. And I think it

41
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.160
was partly if you don't
become a manager, it sort

42
00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.410
of threatened the people on
that team or threaten the

43
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.160
project. So I kind of
semi reluctantly did it just

44
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.650
to see if the project
and then realized I just,

45
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.130
I just did not like
being a manager, you know,

46
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.270
I don't really want to
know about people's salaries and,

47
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.500
and have that kind of
responsibility. So in the end

48
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.600
I said like, I actually
really don't want to do

49
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.100
this anymore. And luckily the
company was okay with, I

50
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.470
guess, realizing that I could
just carry on. As I

51
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.350
had been before I was
called a manager and I

52
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.020
was still effectively running a
team and running a project.

53
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.190
So a lot of things
didn't change, but I was

54
00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.090
definitely happier. Was That hard
though? I mean, do you

55
00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.460
mean like when I was
given a team, I have

56
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.740
felt like, Oh gosh, like,
are they going to think?

57
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.480
I don't like people, if
I say, I don't want

58
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.740
to be a manager, like,
is it gonna affect my

59
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.680
career? I wonder how many
people go into management because

60
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.800
they love it versus they
just have been around so

61
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.610
long. Now you should be
a manager. Oh, definitely. I

62
00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.990
think there's huge pressure to
once you've been at an

63
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.040
ICU for a certain amount
of years, I think there's

64
00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.650
huge pressure to be a
manager it's sort of Theo

65
00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.760
ne maybe obvious career progression
choice for a lot of

66
00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.210
folk, which is a real
shame. What does that mean

67
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.380
like that? No one's ever
dug into that. You're Oh,

68
00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.060
it's like you show up
to a company for five

69
00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.250
years or 10 years. Someone
looks at you and says,

70
00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.190
Oh, it's you, you're still
here. Hey, QB should be

71
00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.590
a manager. Like why? Because
you're here still. And I

72
00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.410
think some companies go like
the pendulum swings a little

73
00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.480
bit. Like, I mean, my
stint as an it manager

74
00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.880
was at GitHub. And when,
once upon a time it

75
00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.580
get on play, there were
famously no managers at all.

76
00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.530
And I mean, it was
actually kind of grid for

77
00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.310
a while. I mean, there
were definite definite downsides, but

78
00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.070
like, you know, a lot
of things shipped and you

79
00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:15.720
know, people were very self-driven
self motivated. Cause I guess

80
00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.810
you had to be. So
I don't know if some

81
00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.930
companies, I think that have
swung really far in the

82
00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.590
other direction of like manager
is the be all and

83
00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.140
end all of everything and
there's, that's increased the, the

84
00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.460
pressure to like, this is
the direction your career should

85
00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.600
go. And certainly like there's
a lot of promotion, you

86
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.880
know, there's, there's a lot
of promotion possibilities for people

87
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.460
in the, in that path
and much less. So on

88
00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.600
the IC In your blog
posts, you call that out.

89
00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.330
Like you were a manager
for 73 days, you counted,

90
00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.910
it sounds like, but you
decided it wasn't for you

91
00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.370
and your fortunately the company
didn't judge you or give

92
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:54.750
you a hard time for
saying, I don't want to

93
00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.240
be a manager. And you
decided that, you know, there

94
00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.750
should be a path for
technical leaders who are individual

95
00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.960
contributors, but does that mean
that you are you the

96
00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.760
person who is trying to
go along this path is

97
00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.940
like the smartest at your,
not necessarily your senior, your

98
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.910
later in career, but you're
not saying that you're the

99
00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.360
most technical person on the
team. You're just someone who's

100
00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.930
got it. Definitely not. Like
I am probably never the

101
00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.920
smartest person in the room,
so to speak. I think

102
00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:27.000
what it is more about
and what I'm better at

103
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.030
is just moving things forward
and getting the right people

104
00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:34.270
together in the room and
figuring out what's missing and

105
00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.320
how can we, how can
we solve those problems and

106
00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.280
just continually moving things forward
more than, yeah, I think

107
00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:47.460
it's more by persistence and
maybe stubbornness than pure technical

108
00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.860
knowledge. And obviously like you,
you know, you have to

109
00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.420
have a certain amount of
the technical skills to back

110
00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:58.460
that up, but yeah, it's
more, more broad, You know,

111
00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.100
I really appreciate that word
persistence. And I, I think

112
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.110
about the, kind of, some
of the younger and earlier

113
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:06.680
in career people that I,
that I mentor and it's

114
00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.320
hard to teach them that,
but honestly just you can't

115
00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:13.700
solve every problem in 45
minutes of Googling. You just

116
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.060
need to sit down and
do it. And like, when

117
00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.700
I think about it as
well, like the projects that

118
00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.400
I've seen her for the
years feel like it's never

119
00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:26.260
been because those engineers weren't
smart enough quite the country,

120
00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:29.980
maybe sometimes, but when people
are too honed in on

121
00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:33.550
a technical solution, the chances
of that, you know, especially

122
00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:37.180
in a bigger organization or,
you know, the chances of

123
00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:41.260
the technical knowledge being enough
to see something through DSPs

124
00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:45.550
successful Shep is just so
slammed. I think that, yeah,

125
00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:49.960
it really does take persistence
and figure. And I had

126
00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.880
all the other parts of
the jigsaw puzzle to get

127
00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:55.180
something successfully shipped something. Yeah.
I think that we sometimes

128
00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:58.540
mythologized the more elder engineer
and we just assume that

129
00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.370
like, well, they're, they've been
here 20 years. They must

130
00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:03.460
know everything. One day I'll
be that smart, but it's

131
00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:06.010
really that they're good at
coordinating. They're good at communicating.

132
00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:08.500
And they also sometimes know
what other orgs are working

133
00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.770
on so that you might
propose a technical solution and

134
00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:14.440
you go, well, you know,
actually strategically in a year,

135
00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:16.660
that's not the direction we
want to go, but a

136
00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:20.620
line engineer wouldn't know that.
Absolutely. Yeah. And like being

137
00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:23.650
in touch with like, what
does the business really need?

138
00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:25.960
And what's it still going
to need in a year's

139
00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.530
time or two year's time
or keeping in touch with

140
00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:33.850
that is probably pretty critically
important. And then I think

141
00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:37.150
that I find has really
worked for me is also

142
00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:40.240
knowing what I'm not good
at and finding the people

143
00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:46.270
to work with that balance.
My skillset, like one big

144
00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:50.290
project I worked on at
get hub. Like I specifically,

145
00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:52.810
like I formed a team
to work on this, on

146
00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:57.310
this big project and recruited
people that would valance my

147
00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:01.480
skill sets. So like were,
I guess there are things

148
00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:06.130
that also don't stress me
out like timed deadlines and

149
00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.940
doing all the coordination between
different groups, but there are

150
00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:13.240
other engineers that hit that
side of things, but maybe

151
00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:16.660
are like super good at
getting into the nitty gritty

152
00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:18.850
of the code or refactor
in something. And it's a

153
00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:21.190
team and that was kind
of skills together has really

154
00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:24.250
worked well. For me, It
seems like though, at a

155
00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:26.350
certain age, as you move
through the kind of the

156
00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:31.420
bell curve of your career,
it's hard to say that

157
00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:34.180
you don't know something and
that you want to balance

158
00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:36.520
it out. Like that's a
very mature thing to say.

159
00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.770
I think a lot of
early in career people think

160
00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:40.840
that they will eventually become
a Swiss army knife and

161
00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:43.930
know everything, but acknowledging like,
you know, I'm just not

162
00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:47.230
a, I don't know, low
level dumped the bugger type

163
00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:49.360
and that's just not my
thing. And I'm not going

164
00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:52.630
to apologize for it not
being my thing. Yeah. I

165
00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:56.280
guess I've definitely noticed as
I've got or more experienced

166
00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:00.900
that I, I'm more comfortable
saying that. And maybe it's

167
00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:03.450
a mixture of like being
comfortable in what you do

168
00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:07.620
know, but I've become very
comfortable of saying in a

169
00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:10.650
group like, Oh, I like,
what does that word mean?

170
00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:13.260
That you're, that you're saying
like, what what's that acronym?

171
00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.380
Or like, You know, I,
I do I do I

172
00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:18.200
do it now because sometimes
I'm suspicious in meetings where

173
00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.750
they'll say an acronym and
I'm thinking that maybe they

174
00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:23.690
did it just to make
us all feel dumb and

175
00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:25.460
I'll just stare them down.
Like, I don't know what

176
00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:27.890
that acronym is, what does
that mean? And also all

177
00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:30.290
the young people and all
the early career people don't

178
00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:32.090
know. So then I'm like,
I'm not going to let

179
00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:34.370
them all just sit there
and hang in and go

180
00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:36.890
later and Google what that
is. Oh, tell me what

181
00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:39.440
that acronym is. Totally. And
I think like it's a

182
00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:43.730
really good example to set
for earlier career folk for

183
00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:46.010
the, in my current job
at Fastly I'm in this

184
00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:48.230
little group, the office of
the CTO where there's a

185
00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:53.360
lot of like properly smart
engineers that work on stuff

186
00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:57.980
that is kind of like
completely different to, to my,

187
00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:01.220
to my work, you know,
that are working like on

188
00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:06.050
the packets, you know, something
really newer level that I'm

189
00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:09.110
used to, but what's been
fascinating working with those folk

190
00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:13.550
is that they're not patronized
in or like they'll be

191
00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:18.100
just as fascinated. And what
I'm working on with maybe

192
00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:21.080
the API is that I
don't know, just completely different

193
00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.940
ends of the spectrum. And
that I think the more

194
00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:27.650
mature engineers get like the
lower ego and people are

195
00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:31.430
comfortable saying they don't know
and, and enjoy and just

196
00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:34.970
let you know, learn. And
for people that do have

197
00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:37.790
a specialism in a particular
area, Well, you know, when

198
00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:40.160
you have a good design
and the API APIs are

199
00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.530
clear and you have a
nice, a series of layers,

200
00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:45.560
right? And you say that's
a lovely design that this

201
00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.930
layer calls that layer and
each layer knows what it's

202
00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:50.450
good at doing. You know,
we always talk about single

203
00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:53.630
responsibility principle, but we don't
usually think about that in

204
00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:56.900
the context of people because
everyone's expected to know everything,

205
00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:59.120
but it is nice to
have a team where it's

206
00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.040
like, alright, I know the
packets on the, you know,

207
00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:03.440
and I'll talk to TCP
IP and I'm cool with

208
00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.750
that. And here's the interface
that I'll be interfacing with

209
00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:09.140
you on. And when it's
nice and clear and crisp,

210
00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:12.320
it does work out very
nicely. The organization's layering is

211
00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:16.550
as nice as the software
layering. Yeah, definitely. One of

212
00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:21.170
the best compliments I've had
from a colleague Katrina said

213
00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:24.230
to me, once that I
was her favorite person to

214
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:28.280
disagree with, which I felt
was awesome. And we had

215
00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:31.190
a really good working relationship.
And when we disagreed with

216
00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:33.080
each other, it was always
from a place of like,

217
00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:37.250
Ooh, what do you know
that I don't like, what

218
00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:42.020
are your experiences that have
formed that opinion? And usually

219
00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:45.980
there was, you know, very
good thing that one of

220
00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:49.190
us was just missing. Yeah.
That was pretty, That's a

221
00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:51.350
really important thing to point
out also is that we

222
00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:53.800
always talk about the myth
of the 10 X and

223
00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:56.650
the super smart person that
is in a closet somewhere.

224
00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:59.110
And we just push pizza
under the door and, you

225
00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:01.390
know, they know all the
answers, but we all, we

226
00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:04.330
are this just big Venn
diagram of people with different

227
00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:07.330
experiences. And you might on
this problem, you might know

228
00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:09.640
the thing. And on the
other one, your intuition might

229
00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:13.420
know the thing, sharing that,
that knowledge freely, without judgment,

230
00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:15.940
without any concern makes you
want to go to work

231
00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:17.680
in the morning, as opposed
to the like, Oh, they're

232
00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.450
going to know. I don't
know what I'm doing. I

233
00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:23.790
don't have any. Yeah, absolutely.
You, you used the term

234
00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:27.060
in your blog, strategic technical
leader, and you also have

235
00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:30.060
this great phrase where you
said you love being parachuted

236
00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:32.370
into a situation. You know,
when I think about the

237
00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:34.830
parachuting person, I think about
two kinds. There's either the,

238
00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:37.920
the general that comes in
another example would be like

239
00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:40.260
Harvey Keitel and pulp fiction
where like they have a

240
00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.570
huge problem. And then they
bring in the Wolf to

241
00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:45.810
handle the problem. Or there's
like the technical person who

242
00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:48.600
gets parachuted in like the
Tom cruise type who comes

243
00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.730
in on a wire and
he's here to solve it

244
00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:53.580
all. Cause he knows everything
you're coming in as a

245
00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:56.400
technical leader, more of as
a coordinator, as opposed to

246
00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:58.770
the key, the genius is
here and she will have

247
00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:03.210
the answer. Is that right?
Yes, definitely. I do like

248
00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:06.630
that sort of, I thrive
with that sort of responsibility

249
00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:09.840
of like just Semyon and
you know, my boss or

250
00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:14.640
whoever can just consider it
handled. And I kind of

251
00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:16.980
get a buzz out of
the unknown of that and

252
00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:19.410
being able to go in
and figure out like, what

253
00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:21.360
even are we dealing with
here? You know, what are

254
00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:24.720
the problems? And yeah, I
dunno, I'm a pretty driven

255
00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:28.170
person. And I get a
buzz out of the project

256
00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:30.450
nature of like kind of
work, I think rather than

257
00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:33.480
doing the sort of the
same thing every week for

258
00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.410
every, every week of the
year. There's a great TV

259
00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:40.530
show called scandal. You might've
seen Olivia Pope gifts where she's

260
00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:44.130
walking into her, in her,
a wonderful white raincoat and

261
00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:46.590
she's on the phone like
it's handled. So your boss

262
00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:48.330
calls you and says, this
is a huge problem over

263
00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:51.540
in project a alright handled.
And then you have to

264
00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:53.670
go and actually mean mean
it. Right. You can't just

265
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:56.730
say it. It has to
actually do it. Yeah, absolutely.

266
00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:01.320
Yeah. I think what I've
been trying to communicate to

267
00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:03.510
other folk recently that are
like, Oh, how would you

268
00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:07.110
even approach this work is
like, I've had some exciting

269
00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:09.810
successes that ship and projects,
but what people don't see

270
00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:12.990
is like the Mike Dunn of
preparation that goes before that.

271
00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:16.500
And definitely for me, if
I'm going to put my

272
00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:19.110
name, you know, put my
hand up and say, I'll

273
00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:22.050
handle this. Like I, I
want to be as prepared

274
00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:25.920
as is humanly possible to
make that, make that a

275
00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:30.480
successful project. Hey friends, I
want to thank one of

276
00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:33.690
our sponsors. The company text
control. They're the creator of

277
00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:38.010
TXT text control. It's a
Microsoft word, inspired document editor

278
00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:41.250
library. It's basically a document
processing engine for your web

279
00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:45.300
applications. They've got libraries for
asp.net, MVC for angular, for

280
00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:48.570
no JS. And they just
released a dotnet core version.

281
00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:52.370
It lets you basically integrate
a Wiziwig editor into your

282
00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:55.790
web applications. You can edit
docs, you can do merge

283
00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:59.210
templates. You can include data.
You can even create Adobe

284
00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:02.540
PDF documents. It's a fully
featured API. It's really pretty

285
00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:05.090
amazing. You can try it
free. And I encourage you

286
00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:13.430
to check out the live
demos@textcontrol.com slash demos, text control.com/demos.

287
00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:16.790
It's really pretty amazing piece
of work. Another thing that

288
00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:18.800
you called you've called out
is the idea of the

289
00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:21.710
cultural impact you can have.
And I think sometimes when

290
00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:24.410
someone doesn't have direct reports
when they're not a manager,

291
00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:27.380
when they don't feel senior,
but they are, they want

292
00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:29.810
to be, they feel helpless
that they can't in fact

293
00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:33.590
change the culture of their
organization. But for example, you've

294
00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:38.180
improved technical interview processes and
you've also, you're able you

295
00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:41.270
have a passion and healthy
code reviews. How can you

296
00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:44.930
as a non-manager change the
way an organization does code

297
00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:48.880
reviews and make things better
for people? Oh yeah, it's

298
00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:50.800
a great question. But to
be honest, my experience has

299
00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:54.310
been very different to that
assumption. Like I, I think

300
00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:59.290
you have a lot more
freedom to make change culturally

301
00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:03.340
in an organization maybe than
as a manager or that's

302
00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:06.340
been my experience, you know,
maybe a little more free

303
00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:09.340
of, I don't know that
the chain of command telling

304
00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:11.140
you like this is the
message and this is just

305
00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:14.260
what you have to do.
And maybe a little, it's

306
00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:18.040
a little easier maybe to
challenge the status quo or

307
00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:20.740
maybe you're not as much
as a threat to people.

308
00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:23.620
You know, like if you're
Interesting. So if you're not

309
00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:26.020
a manager you're less of
a threat, which allows you

310
00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:31.300
to get more done because
you're sneaking around shipping Or

311
00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:35.140
like, you know, if so
many different implications, if your

312
00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:37.660
manager is telling people to
do something, you know, and

313
00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:40.690
that person might have an
effect on your performance review

314
00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:44.290
your ultimately your, your salary.
But if a very senior

315
00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:48.940
engineer is promoting or advocating
a certain thing, it's, it's

316
00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:52.600
just different. Those, those competitions
out there. So I find

317
00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:55.930
it's been like, I dunno,
I've just had more space

318
00:16:55.930 --> 00:17:00.370
to, to push back on
certain things or to advocate

319
00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:03.490
for, for certain things. One
of the things you point

320
00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:07.120
out is that this autonomy,
that that ability to move

321
00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:10.360
around is earned by delivering,
right? And I think that's

322
00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:12.730
a thing that for early
in career people to remember

323
00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:15.250
that it's not necessarily just
shipping every quarter because not

324
00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:18.520
everything ships neatly on a
quarter, but just someone asks

325
00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:20.140
you to do something you
deliver, whether it's a big

326
00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:23.050
task or a small task
that slowly builds up kind

327
00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:27.730
of your, your reputation in
the org, your stock effectively

328
00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:29.620
in the org as someone
who can get things done.

329
00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:35.290
Yeah, absolutely. And I guess
one example that was pretty

330
00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:38.650
terrifying at the time, but
of kind of a mixture

331
00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:40.840
of that, like being able
to push back and having

332
00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:44.500
the trust, there was a
time once when something really

333
00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:47.350
senior in the engineering or
didn't like the direction of

334
00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:51.150
a thing and, and said
should just uncheck this, like

335
00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:55.350
literally ship an unshaved. Yeah.
Like literally send, send out

336
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:58.500
an email, tell the, the
beater user saying like, sorry,

337
00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:03.210
we're like taking this back.
And, and I thought it

338
00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:06.450
was a terrible idea. Like
I thought this was a

339
00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:11.280
really good project and that
we should continue it. And

340
00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:14.880
I remember that the product
manager was, had drafted. The

341
00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:18.450
email was ready to send,
to tell the integrators the

342
00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:21.630
next day to pull the
plug on this thing. And

343
00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:26.100
I practically begged him and
said like, please don't send

344
00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:29.220
this email, like give me
40 at ours. And I

345
00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:31.710
will figure out a better
way we can do this.

346
00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:36.480
And he agreed, I guess,
cause I had some credibility

347
00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:38.660
in the area and said
like, okay, you know, you've

348
00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:42.870
got, yeah, you've got 40
at ours. And then, and

349
00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:45.450
then we're pulling the plug
and, and it worked like

350
00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:49.620
I came up with a
different proposal and it turned

351
00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:52.260
out to have been the
right decision, but that was

352
00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:54.930
kind of terrifying. But just
having the, I don't know,

353
00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:57.540
I was in a good
position to question like, this

354
00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:00.570
is, this is actually really
bad decision tonight. I know

355
00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:03.480
you have way more authority
than me, but I think

356
00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:05.580
this is a bad move.
And please let me prove

357
00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:08.450
why That is a movie
that I would want to

358
00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:13.820
see. It's almost like the,
the, the, the archetype of

359
00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:16.220
the, the, the, the bad
cop and the bad cop,

360
00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:17.960
but like the, you know,
the cop that's always getting

361
00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:21.020
in trouble that goes into
the, the sergeant's office. And

362
00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:23.240
they're like, you know, I'm
tired of justifying your craziness

363
00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:25.730
with the commissioner and you're
like, I need 48 hours.

364
00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:28.610
So I just am imagining
you like leaning forward with

365
00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:30.650
your fist on the desk.
I need 48 hours just

366
00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:33.320
get, okay, you've got 36
hours and then you go

367
00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:36.320
off and parachute in and
keep the thing from being

368
00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:40.430
unshipped. Right. Yeah. Amazing. But
this is really important. You

369
00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:43.550
can't just go in there
as someone that hasn't ever

370
00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:46.760
done, anything successful. You, you
have to earn that, that

371
00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:50.570
stock, that reputation, those, those
points. And in this case,

372
00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:52.700
you earned them over a
period of shipping and then

373
00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:55.910
you spent them, but in
the process of spending them

374
00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.690
earned even more because you,
in fact succeeded Yeah. On

375
00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:03.580
that occasion, like I was
right to question and, and,

376
00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:07.130
and the outcome was w
was better offer for everybody.

377
00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:11.810
And I've definitely also lost
those conversations. You know, I've

378
00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:15.440
had similar scenarios where I've
said, like being the annoyance

379
00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:17.330
voice. And like, I, I
think this is the wrong

380
00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:21.500
decision and here here's why,
and, and sort of it

381
00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:23.960
not gone the way I
wanted, but I think that's

382
00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:27.020
also a really good role
that you can play as

383
00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:29.840
a very senior IC is
to be the extra voice

384
00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:36.950
question and things, and, and
sort of helping the discussion

385
00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:39.050
when there, cause there's always
trade offs obviously. Right. And

386
00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:41.960
flavor, always some conflict of,
I don't know whether it's

387
00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:45.620
a short term versus long
term conflict, or if it

388
00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:49.460
meets the business needs rather
the wider ecosystem or whatever

389
00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:52.000
the conflict is like, those
are, those are good meaty

390
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.860
conversations for a senior IC
to get involved in. Another

391
00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:57.690
thing that you talk about
a lot on your blog

392
00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:59.880
is this idea of a
strike team. What is a

393
00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:01.740
strike team and how do
you spin them up and

394
00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:04.440
then ramp them up and
then spin them down. Yeah,

395
00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:07.320
for me, what has worked
is this has come up

396
00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:10.560
by when maybe I've been
working solo on like doing

397
00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:13.410
some research and like kind
of like trying to figure

398
00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:16.110
out what, what we could
do next and come up

399
00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:19.350
with maybe a prototype or
a proposal on here's the

400
00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:21.510
direction and the should go.
This is what I did

401
00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:24.630
with that. Check's API that
you mentioned and had enough

402
00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:27.480
together and convinced enough people
of like, yeah, this is,

403
00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:29.430
this is a really good
idea. We should do this,

404
00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:32.790
but then needed a team
to make that happen. So

405
00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:37.200
that was one occasion where
I recruited people to form

406
00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:39.300
that team. That would be
a fairly short term thing.

407
00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:42.000
And eventually the project would
be owned by a wider

408
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.240
group, but that's where I've
used a strike team. Like

409
00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:48.540
maybe a project that will
last, maybe we'll work on

410
00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:50.400
it together for six months
or nine months. And then

411
00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:52.980
it will be consumed by
the wider, by the wider

412
00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:55.950
group. Do you borrow, are
you borrowing them full time?

413
00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:57.660
How do you manage the
staffing of that? How do

414
00:21:57.660 --> 00:21:59.520
you convince their bosses to
loan them to you? Or

415
00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:02.250
is this volunteer work that
they're doing in their copious

416
00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:06.150
spare time Mixture of like
getting the, what? Well, what

417
00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:08.190
I have done is a
mixture of getting the individual

418
00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:11.820
on board first and then
are making sure that they'd

419
00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:14.520
be interested in and onboard
and then go into the

420
00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:17.490
manager and just present the
case of like, why this

421
00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:21.600
would be really valuable for
the company, for the team.

422
00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:24.030
And also that, you know,
I really need that person

423
00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:28.890
specifically. And usually that's, I've
had a mixture of like

424
00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:31.950
either half and people maybe
not completely full time. Maybe

425
00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:33.840
that's a negotiated thing of
like, can I have this

426
00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:36.540
person for X days a
week? And they can still

427
00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:40.140
do whatever general team responsibilities
that, that you know, that

428
00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:42.870
they have, but that that's,
that's worked out really well

429
00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:44.910
for me. What is some
advice that you would give

430
00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:47.190
someone in the sense of
you've been a senior IC

431
00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:49.590
in various orgs, but now
you actually, you actually have

432
00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:52.740
some positional privilege in that
someone you could email someone

433
00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:55.200
who doesn't know you in
the org and then they

434
00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.150
would go, Oh, office of
the CTO, and now you

435
00:22:57.150 --> 00:22:59.370
suddenly got a label behind
you to back you up.

436
00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:02.190
You've built the reputation up.
So that's why you're there

437
00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:05.550
now. But how can I
show senior IC who doesn't

438
00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:09.150
necessarily have a label like
that get included? Is it

439
00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:12.780
just through clarity of their
communication style and their, their

440
00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:15.330
own reputation? Like it's such
a dip, it's a thing

441
00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:18.270
that is dependent on reputation
as you are building that

442
00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:21.480
up and you don't have,
you know, you don't, you're

443
00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:23.310
not 20 years in, maybe
you're seven years into your

444
00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:26.460
career. How do you get
included in those conversations? Yeah,

445
00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:29.430
it's so hard. And to
be honest, even like, I've

446
00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:31.560
struggled with that a times,
even when I, you know,

447
00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:34.380
in theory had built up
the credibility and, you know,

448
00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:37.710
she should have been included
or respected or whatever. I

449
00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:40.500
think some of the things
that can work well is

450
00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:43.980
either having an explicit sponsor,
like someone really in a

451
00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:48.410
high position in the, to,
to, to advocate for you,

452
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:54.260
whether you're present or not,
or having some peers that

453
00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:56.810
will back you up in
a, in a group call

454
00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:01.570
That sponsorship idea. I was
talking with David Fowler. David Fowler is

455
00:24:01.570 --> 00:24:04.150
one of the architects of.net
and asp.net. And he's a,

456
00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:05.350
by the way, he told
me to tell you he's

457
00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:08.680
a big fan of your
blog. And he really likes

458
00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:14.440
the differentiation between the word
mentor and sponsor, you know,

459
00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:17.560
mentors give you advice, but
sponsors will sneak you into

460
00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:19.960
meetings basically. And let you
sit in the back and

461
00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:22.600
then you just wait for
your moment to pounce, say

462
00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:25.510
something smart. And then suddenly
you moved from sitting on

463
00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:27.640
the back wall or leaning
against the back wall to

464
00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:31.210
sitting at the table. Right?
Yeah. And funny, I had

465
00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:35.950
a position once, like a
informal position where I was

466
00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:40.240
really acting as the technical
representative for my department, but

467
00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:43.570
until we put a name
to that, there was always

468
00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:49.180
difficulty in, I guess, people
taking me seriously and, and

469
00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:52.630
big group calls. And so
I, I went to like

470
00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:54.640
my, my boss at the
time who was, you know,

471
00:24:54.670 --> 00:24:58.420
had more seniority or, you
know, had a good title

472
00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:01.000
and said like, can cheat.
This will just make things

473
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.730
easier for everyone. Could you
just tell them officially that

474
00:25:03.730 --> 00:25:07.570
I, you know, acting as
the technical representative and once

475
00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:10.720
he did that, it made
life so much easier. Was

476
00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:13.030
that hard to do that?
I mean, cause you're basically

477
00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:15.160
like, I'll be honest. I've
done that as well. I've

478
00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:18.790
I've, I've asked someone it's,
isn't it funny? We're here

479
00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:21.490
talking with two grown people
saying, you know, you could

480
00:25:21.490 --> 00:25:23.650
just say what you want
and maybe they'll give it

481
00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:27.730
to you. It still feels
like, you know, tall grade

482
00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:29.320
school where it's like, I
really want to go on

483
00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:33.700
the field trip. I said,
I'd like to be in

484
00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:35.050
that meeting. I think I
would have a lot of

485
00:25:35.050 --> 00:25:37.900
value if you'd let me
join you all. And they'll

486
00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:40.090
either say yes or no.
And the problem is you

487
00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:41.560
have to prep for the
know and be ready for

488
00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:44.860
the yes. Yeah. Well, hi.
I find it easier to

489
00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:47.320
like, I don't know, deal
with in my own head

490
00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:50.130
is that I'm not asking
for a fee ever, you

491
00:25:50.130 --> 00:25:53.380
know, like the company has
already asked me to perform

492
00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:56.380
this role and it would
just make it easier if

493
00:25:56.380 --> 00:26:01.570
everybody else understood that context
as well. So Yeah. Isn't

494
00:26:01.570 --> 00:26:03.760
that the thing though, con
it's all about context, you

495
00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:06.670
know, this is why at
the beginning, when you said

496
00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:10.690
Katrina, how she said that
you were the favorite person

497
00:26:10.690 --> 00:26:12.490
to disagree with, because it's
like, well, what do you

498
00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:14.200
know? What do you know?
You know, what do you

499
00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:16.810
know? It's all about? It's
not about, who's the smartest

500
00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:18.910
it's about who has the
context that we're missing. And

501
00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:22.420
then if we all get
the context, then we'll be

502
00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:24.190
able to pull this thing
off. And that ultimately is

503
00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:27.640
what the technical icy is
supposed to do is build

504
00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:31.990
consensus and energy. Yeah, absolutely.
So you use this power,

505
00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:34.540
you've got this independence, you
don't have an, a team

506
00:26:34.570 --> 00:26:37.750
as much, you're able to
go and then support and

507
00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:40.630
influence other things. Are you
kind of applying pressure on

508
00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:44.100
different orgs and different folks
to move the strategic direction

509
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:48.410
forward? Yes, very, very much
like my current role is

510
00:26:48.410 --> 00:26:52.760
I'm leading the strategy for
the API at Fastly. And

511
00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:55.280
that involves like talking to
a whole bunch of different

512
00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:58.190
teams and figuring lately, you
know, what, what they need

513
00:26:58.190 --> 00:27:02.210
and how to move things
forward. You mentioned a minute

514
00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:05.840
ago who like haven't asked
explicitly, or it seems so

515
00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:09.020
simple to say, like, here's
what I want. And I

516
00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:11.330
find the opposite is true.
Like talking to other teams

517
00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:14.120
of like, just asking people
like, what do you actually

518
00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:17.510
need? Like, what are you,
what are you that's, that's

519
00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.390
been really helpful. And that's,
that gets to your point

520
00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:23.600
about, you're not just an
engineer talking to other engineers,

521
00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:29.120
right? There's technical writers, product
managers, interface, designers, salespeople, lawyers,

522
00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:32.030
you have a whole list
here, execs, competitors, peers, users.

523
00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:34.760
It's usually, you know, who
talks to all of those

524
00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:38.720
people who coordinates all of
those people, a senior icy,

525
00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:41.300
a senior, you know, independent
can go and do that

526
00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:44.570
when maybe someone else doing
it wouldn't land the same.

527
00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:49.280
Yeah, absolutely. I take a
very collaborative approach to that.

528
00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:51.800
I, a mixture of just
what I think works and

529
00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:54.950
my personality, like I'm not
gonna kind of come in

530
00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:57.890
and try and boss anybody
around. So I definitely am

531
00:27:57.890 --> 00:28:00.110
always trying to like, just,
just get, get, buy in

532
00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:02.210
and get people on board,
you know, and a lot

533
00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:06.590
of that's three smaller conversations
and, and, and building that

534
00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:10.190
up. So I've realized that
as someone who is complaining

535
00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:12.560
about acronyms, I don't remember
if we ever actually told

536
00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:14.990
people that I see as
an individual contributor and that'll

537
00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:17.750
be my bed. Cause it's,
it's, you know, independent contributor,

538
00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:21.200
individual contributor, one who doesn't
have a full team. Like,

539
00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:24.110
you know, you don't know
your, you don't have people

540
00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:26.060
who work for you directly
from an HR perspective. You're

541
00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:29.390
not signing checks. You're not
promoting people. You're, you're an

542
00:28:29.390 --> 00:28:32.780
individual or an independent contributor
in a strategic technical leadership

543
00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:35.840
role. And like you said,
it's a hard path. You

544
00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:38.120
kind of have to ask
for it. Don't you have

545
00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:43.250
to cultivate that path. Yeah,
definitely. I think for, for

546
00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:48.860
me, what has worked is
just really just realizing the

547
00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:51.380
parts of that work that
I really enjoy and the

548
00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:54.530
parts that I don't like
so much and just being

549
00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:59.330
persistent and, and, and trying
to create and do well.

550
00:28:59.330 --> 00:29:01.670
And there's opportunities that kind
of align me to keep

551
00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:04.190
doing that. And, Well, cool.
Well, thank you so much

552
00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:06.890
for chatting with me today.
Yeah. Thank you so much

553
00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:10.340
for having me. We've been
talking with Kevi McMahon. You

554
00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:14.480
can check out her blog@covid.com
that's <inaudible> V Y she's

555
00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:16.880
got lots of great information
about how you can thrive

556
00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:20.240
as an individual contributor and
build bridges as a technical

557
00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:24.080
leader. This has been another
episode of Hanselminutes and we'll

558
00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:37.220
see you again next week.
