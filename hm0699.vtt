Hey friends, summers longer days
and slower pace. Invite us

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.750
to pick up a book,
follow our questions and try

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.870
our hand at something new.
The work of modern software

4
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.570
developers is evolving in ways
that are both challenging and

5
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.900
rewarding. As a developer, it's
essential that you cultivate a

6
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.650
security mindset and to help
we've put together a collection

7
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.180
of information, security books, podcasts,
blogs, and hands on exercises

8
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.410
recommended by Vira coders, across
our development security and product

9
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.610
teams from a just published
page Turner to classic frack

10
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.520
articles. There's something here for
everyone who is interested in

11
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.910
becoming more security minded. So
dip your toes in, or

12
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.440
take a deep dive visit
www dot Vira code. That's

13
00:00:43.440 --> 00:01:06.680
V R a code.com/reading that's
code.com/reading. This is Scott Hanselman.

14
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.870
This is another episode of
Hansel minutes. And today I'm

15
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.560
talking with Cheryl Contee. She
is the author of mechanical

16
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.190
bull. How you can achieve
startup success. I just read

17
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.730
this on my Kindle and
it was fantastic. Well, thanks,

18
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.840
Scott. It's great to be
here. Yeah. This is an

19
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.100
interesting story about not, it's
just it's it's functional advice,

20
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.870
but it is also your
story about how you, you

21
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.520
know, started, you have had
multiple startups now and, and

22
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.320
had an exit soldiers startup,
and some really significant advice

23
00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.950
because traditional startup advice doesn't
kind of always apply to

24
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.890
everybody. Does it, It really
doesn't. You know, and I

25
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.700
think that people often assume
like here, for example, you

26
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.070
know, the friends and there's
something called the friends and

27
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.620
family round, where it's assumed
that you have raised a

28
00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.860
bunch of money from, you
know, your, your colleagues from

29
00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.100
your friends and your family.
And you know, me, you

30
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.850
know, as a technologist from
a pretty humble background, you

31
00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.860
know, I'm one of the,
I make the most in

32
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.960
my family or I'm one
of them and, you know,

33
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.170
peanut and Ray are asking
me for money, right? So

34
00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.950
there's no, my friends and
family round would have gathered

35
00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.160
about $200. So, you know,
I think that, you know,

36
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.540
I really tried hard in
the book to say, look,

37
00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.790
if you've got a really
great idea and you've got

38
00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.580
the energy and the ambition,
you know, no matter who

39
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.160
you are, no matter where
you're from, you know, here's

40
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.370
what you need to know
about the life cycle of

41
00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.690
startups to be successful. Right?
And you walk people through

42
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.300
the raising of the money,
the different ways that you

43
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.550
can raise money, the different
ways that you can exit.

44
00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.470
But one of the things
that I thought was interesting,

45
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.410
just in part one, right
off the bat, you asked

46
00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.440
the question, do you have
what it takes? And I

47
00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.780
know that you feel strongly
that kind of the term

48
00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.200
gatekeeping is important that we
don't want to have Gates

49
00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.600
that we prevent people from
entrepreneurialship, but you do very

50
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.180
clearly say that it's not
for everyone. And you might

51
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.220
need to ask yourself the
hard question. Are you an

52
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.650
entrepreneur? Absolutely. I mean, look,
you know, it's part of

53
00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.100
the American character, right? Of,
you know, having your own

54
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.540
business, you know, even being
your own boss and that's

55
00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.880
good, you know, that's a
good thing, but look, you

56
00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.400
know, if you're, if your
dream is look, I want

57
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.830
to work from home in
my pajamas and I'm going

58
00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.950
to be my own boss.
That all sounds well and

59
00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.650
good. But here's the thing,
you know, imagine having, instead

60
00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.980
of one boss like bosses,
as far as the eye

61
00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.430
can see, who are your
clients and customers, does that

62
00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.270
appeal to you or does
that frighten you? Right. You

63
00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:47.790
know, if you're working from
home in your pajamas, there's

64
00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.890
a good chance that, Hey,
you're working from home because

65
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.890
you can't afford an office
yet. And B you're working

66
00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.980
in your pajamas because you
have been working straight, you

67
00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.010
know, you don't have time
to put on pants. So

68
00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.400
just keep it really real
in the book. And also

69
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.880
look, are you a self
motivator? You know, some people

70
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.180
really do work better being
in an office with other

71
00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.450
people. And oftentimes when you're
launching your own business, you

72
00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.910
know, there's, there's a lot
of time when you are

73
00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.490
working with a much smaller
team or on your own.

74
00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:20.250
And if you're not the
kind of person who will

75
00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.480
get up, assign yourself, you
know, to quote Marian Wright,

76
00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.630
Edelman, founder of a children's
defense fund. If you're not

77
00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.100
the kind of person who
will get up and assign

78
00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.640
yourself, but instead left to
your own devices in your

79
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.790
home office will just consume
a whole bunch of YouTube

80
00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.300
and maybe a chocolate cake,
like entrepreneurship is not for

81
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.330
you. Like you've really got
to know yourself. Hmm. That

82
00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.140
is really difficult. Like some,
you have to do the

83
00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.510
work, but how do you
make sure that you're not

84
00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:52.050
saying like try harder or
as I think Cheryl Shambrook

85
00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.170
famously said lean in, like
there's, there's leaning in and

86
00:04:55.170 --> 00:05:00.360
then there's leaning in. Yeah.
Look leaning in doesn't mean

87
00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.190
the same thing too. I
think every person and, you

88
00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.590
know, I do think there
are, you know, it, timing

89
00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.110
is important. Right. And one
of the things I think

90
00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.570
to consider is is this
the right time for you,

91
00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.010
right. Are you pregnant? Right.
And, and are about to

92
00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.980
have a baby. This might
not be the optimal time

93
00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.290
to launch that startup. I
know people who have done

94
00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.260
it and some people can,
can handle that. But for

95
00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.480
other people they might say,
you know what? I want

96
00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.430
to wait a couple years.
You know, I want to

97
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.070
get my grounding. You know,
I wanna, you know, get

98
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:35.340
my kid up and running.
I want to heal, you

99
00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.250
know, my body, you know,
or, you know, make sure

100
00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.920
everyone's taken care of. And
then I want to switch

101
00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:45.240
my focus. Right. And that's
just one example. It could

102
00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.270
be, are you in the
right place with your, with

103
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.820
your parents? Are they healthy?
Are they, I know people

104
00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.460
who have a family situations
where like, this is not

105
00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.110
the right time. I want
to spend time with my

106
00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.740
kids, with my family, with
my partner, with my, whatever.

107
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.980
Well, in finances, you know,
have you really lined up?

108
00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:02.870
And one of the things
I talk about in the

109
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:04.820
book, right? In terms of,
are you an entrepreneur? Are

110
00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:09.920
you comfortable being paid last?
Because you know, a lot

111
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.630
of people think, Oh, you
know, I'm going to launch

112
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.330
this business and I'm going
to be rich. But you

113
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.450
know, ultimately, especially in that
first year to 18 months,

114
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.620
you know, you might have
vendors or suppliers to pay,

115
00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.380
right. You might have employees
to pay and all of

116
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:28.280
those, all, that's your responsibility,
you know, that's your commitment

117
00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.740
is to make sure everybody
else is whole and then

118
00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.440
what's left over is for
you. And so, you know,

119
00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:38.210
do you have, you know,
enough of a foundation such

120
00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:41.570
that you can, whether, you
know, a, an occasional week

121
00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:44.120
or two waiting to get
paid, you know, instead of

122
00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:49.360
getting paid, for example, regularly
every two weeks, That idea

123
00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.670
that are you willing to
take, the risk of being

124
00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:55.000
paid last is really, really
important and powerful. Like you,

125
00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:58.360
when you were doing your
startup with your partner, you

126
00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.220
actually had to pay some
of your own money to

127
00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:02.980
make payroll. That's a, I
don't know if I'd have

128
00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:06.940
that level of commitment to
my startups. Yeah. I think

129
00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.370
it's pretty common. I think
it's, you know, and I

130
00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:12.970
would, I actually set aside
money just in case it's

131
00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:15.130
just a, okay, here's a
slush fund, you know, in

132
00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:18.910
case, you know, I need
10 K to make payroll,

133
00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:21.250
I'll get it paid back.
I was always confident, you

134
00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:22.840
know, that we would get,
you know, that I'd be

135
00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:25.810
made whole, but right. I
mean, that takes a certain

136
00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:29.740
amount of self discipline, you
know, and maturity to say,

137
00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:32.050
look, I know that I
have to set aside a

138
00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:34.990
certain portion of my income
just in case I have

139
00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:38.020
to be my own line
of credit until I can

140
00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:40.840
get a line of credit.
It can take, oftentimes banks

141
00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:44.950
want to see two years
worth of business, a business

142
00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:48.310
being alive before they're willing
to extend a line of

143
00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:52.510
credit and yet most businesses
as, you know, fail within

144
00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:55.600
the first year. So that
means, you know, you may

145
00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.480
need to be your own
line of credit and manage

146
00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:01.970
your money very carefully, along
the way. One of the

147
00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:03.160
things that came up in
the book and I was

148
00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:06.820
actually a little surprised about
was it appeared to me

149
00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:08.800
and correct me if I'm
wrong, that you really, you

150
00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.080
used examples of your own
life, where you were doing

151
00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:13.840
startups early. You know, I
did this at 14. I

152
00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:16.270
did that at 13. I
was thinking entrepreneurially in my

153
00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:19.480
mid teens. And I thought
to myself, well, I've done

154
00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:22.120
that too. And I know
people who've done that, but

155
00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.490
I also know people for
whom that's not intuitive or

156
00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:27.820
natural. How, how important is
it that we get young

157
00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:30.660
people thinking about these things
and whether it be lemonades,

158
00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:34.930
lemonade stands that turn into
a bee sweet lemonade, which

159
00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:36.580
is like a legit company
and you can buy it

160
00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:40.690
at a whole foods. Is,
is that really entrepreneurship or

161
00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:43.750
is that just kids being
kids? Well, I think kids

162
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:48.280
are naturally entrepreneurial and, and
you know, the, the instinct

163
00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:52.120
of, you know, the, the
marketplace, right? The, the village

164
00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:56.070
marketplace, I mean, marketplaces are
something that is a, an

165
00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:01.080
ancient human activity. So I
think that you may identify

166
00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:04.470
in your kid, you know,
that kid who always kind

167
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:07.830
of on their game right.
On their hustle. So the

168
00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:12.300
book I describe, I had
a little boyfriend in, in

169
00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:17.460
nursery school and kindergarten and,
you know, kids really like

170
00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:19.020
to see us kiss. We
would lean in, we would

171
00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:22.170
stand like two feet away
from each other. And then,

172
00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:26.280
you know, slowly, you know,
find, you know, lean in

173
00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:28.890
so that we would find
each other's lips and kids,

174
00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:32.390
other kids found this behavior
fascinating, right? Like our, our,

175
00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:35.940
our quote, passionate love affair.
So, you know, and so

176
00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:38.070
they'd be like kiss kiss.
So at some point I

177
00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:40.380
said, you know what, people,
they should be paying us

178
00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:43.020
like this, I'm not a
monkey. Okay. This isn't a

179
00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:47.760
zoo. So for big kids,
like, you know, maybe a

180
00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:51.720
fourth grade and up, they,
it would cost them 25 cents.

181
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:53.730
If they wanted to see
us kiss for, you know,

182
00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:56.010
young kids, our age or
younger kids, it was more

183
00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:57.840
of a sliding scale kind
of, you know, what have

184
00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:01.710
you got right. Anywhere from
a penny to two, a

185
00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:05.610
dime. And so, you know,
my little boyfriend at the

186
00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:09.870
time, Stevie was more of
a romantic and had some,

187
00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:12.960
some issues with, you know,
the, the selling essentially of

188
00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:16.020
our love and to keep
him to mollify him and

189
00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:18.510
keep him in the business,
you know, I could buy,

190
00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:20.580
you know, eventually I would
scrape up enough so that

191
00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:23.820
we could buy, you know,
candy or ice cream, but

192
00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:25.770
like, you know, it was
in me. Right. It was

193
00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:28.470
definitely in me to do
that. And you may have

194
00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:30.750
a kid who's sort of
just got these ideas and

195
00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:32.850
is always trying to, you
know, who or like is

196
00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:36.060
really passionate about monopoly. Right.
And like really likes that

197
00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:38.430
kind of game or just,
you know, ask certain kinds

198
00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:40.650
of questions. And, you know,
you can nurture that. I

199
00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:43.320
remember in, I wanna say
it was the sixth grade,

200
00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:46.140
this isn't in the book,
this is special for Hansel

201
00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:50.910
minutes listeners. We actually filled
out, they taught us in

202
00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:54.300
school randomly for no apparent
reason how to write a

203
00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:58.290
check. And it just felt
like such an adult activity.

204
00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:01.440
It had never occurred to
me to write to like,

205
00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:04.830
you know, like how a
check works and how banking

206
00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:07.650
works. And, you know, it
just switched on a light

207
00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:10.320
in my brain that I
wouldn't use of course until

208
00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.540
later, but you'd be surprised,
you know, I think that's

209
00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:16.290
why there's this emphasis on
teaching kids to code now,

210
00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:18.960
you know, as early as
possible, it's not that, you

211
00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:21.630
know, you necessarily want to
force your kid to become

212
00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:25.350
a developer or a software
engineer, but the coding it's

213
00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:28.860
like Shakespeare or algebra. It
just, it changes something in

214
00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:31.960
your brain, you know, and
about you to engage in

215
00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:35.520
activities, such that even if
you don't use it later,

216
00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:39.030
you know, you, you have
opened up new doors and

217
00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:41.700
new capacity inside yourself. So
that's why I think it's

218
00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:44.940
important to encourage entrepreneurship and
kids, even if they don't

219
00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:48.450
end up launching their own
business, they've learned something about

220
00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:51.270
themselves and about how the
world works. You know, that's

221
00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:53.680
gonna, that's going to shape
them in a positive way.

222
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:58.030
Yeah. I feel like it
is about it's about agency

223
00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:02.170
and about empowerment. And one
can, can decide to sell

224
00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:04.210
lemonade. I always use that
as a great example. Every

225
00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:07.300
kid should do that, or
girl scout cookies, or if

226
00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:10.750
you can, you know, I
drew comic book art, so

227
00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:13.390
I would draw art, photocopy
it and sell it for

228
00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:16.630
25 cents. And then I got
a table at the local

229
00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:19.180
comic convention and sell prints
for a dollar kind of

230
00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:21.940
thing. The idea that I
could create something out of

231
00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:27.580
nothing, thereby creating value and
then participate in economy, gave

232
00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:29.740
me a sense of empowerment
and agency as a kid.

233
00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:32.940
I think Absolutely all of
a sudden, you see yourself

234
00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:36.540
as a person who can
move independently in the world

235
00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:39.630
and who, you know, has
created something of value that

236
00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:42.960
other people want, as opposed
to being someone who is

237
00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:45.600
a taker, right. Which as
a kid, you know, one

238
00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.870
feels a lot of the
time like a taker. So

239
00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:50.700
when you have the idea,
when you come up with

240
00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:53.430
the idea, how important is
it that I, that idea

241
00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:56.430
of fill a gap versus
what some of the things

242
00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:59.460
that we're seeing now, where
they are simply commodities that

243
00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:02.340
are delivered more efficiently than
before? I think those are

244
00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:05.370
two different kinds of products.
Those are two different kinds

245
00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:09.960
of products. Actually. I think
both are important. Look, you

246
00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:13.830
know, I wrote this book
such that, you know, anyone

247
00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:17.010
who has a great idea
and the energy and ambition

248
00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:21.510
to unleash that idea into
the world, you know, wants

249
00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:24.390
to do that in order
to improve people's lives. And

250
00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:26.910
there's a lot of different
ways to improve people's lives,

251
00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:30.480
right? One of them, right?
It's just getting people, food,

252
00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:34.320
you know, in a more
efficient, faster, healthier way, right?

253
00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:38.790
Everybody eats, you know, food
is not new. Achieving food

254
00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:41.490
in your mouth is not
new, but you know, maybe

255
00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:44.970
having a, you know, Uber
drop off your food, maybe

256
00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:48.960
that's new. Hey, friends as
a software engineer, chances are

257
00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:52.590
you've crossed paths with Mongo
DB. At some point, whether

258
00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:54.720

268
00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:39.810
Okay. So I've got an
idea and I'm going to

269
00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:43.080
go and build a team
in the book. You invoke

270
00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:46.140
the idea of the visionary
and the geek, kind of

271
00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:49.890
the, you know, the, the
bomber and the, the bill

272
00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:52.310
Gates or the, you know,
the, the yin and the

273
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:54.620
yang. How important do you
think it is to have

274
00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:58.660
that partner? Oh, essential. Essential.
And I think, you know,

275
00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:04.480
particularly, you know, people who
might be maybe your, what

276
00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:08.890
they call a nontraditional entrepreneur.
Right. You know, oftentimes people

277
00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:11.170
are, you know, they feel
like they, they it's taken

278
00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:14.110
them so long to get
here. Right. And they're an

279
00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:16.360
army of one, right. They
see themselves as like, I

280
00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:18.730
can, you know, I've gotten
here and that was hard

281
00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:23.440
and I can do anything.
But actually what investors in

282
00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:27.460
particular are looking for is
your understanding that you don't

283
00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:31.150
know everything and you can't
do everything right. And that's

284
00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:34.570
an important, like, is there
any humility because you know,

285
00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:38.050
any good business ultimately is
going to be a function

286
00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:40.810
of the quality of the
team and a team that

287
00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:46.510
is multifaceted and multifunctional. So
the visionary is that person

288
00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:53.530
who, you know, can can
wax rhapsodic about the technology,

289
00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:56.020
about how it's going to
change people's lives, you know,

290
00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:58.600
who is really great at
representing and, and, you know,

291
00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:01.240
telling the story of the
product. But the geek is,

292
00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:03.700
this is someone who may
or may not be that,

293
00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:06.220
you know, out front, but
as someone who has a

294
00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:10.680
lot of technical expertise and
can really actually implement and

295
00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:13.120
make it happen, and those
two are equals you can't

296
00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:17.320
really have one without the
other. And is the idea

297
00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:19.540
to have two people, because
just simply, it's just too

298
00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:21.070
hard to have one person
do all this kind of

299
00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:24.730
work. I've just found it,
rare that all of that

300
00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:28.210
is in one person. Sometimes
it is, you know, sometimes,

301
00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:31.150
you know, you find someone
who can embody all of

302
00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:35.680
those things, but generally speaking,
there's someone who often leans

303
00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:38.830
more and as is just,
it's easier for them in

304
00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:42.580
one direction being the visionary.
And, you know, there's another

305
00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:46.810
person who is, you know,
focused on the implementation. So,

306
00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:49.930
you know, another example might
be Tim cook and Steve

307
00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:54.310
jobs. Right. You know, Steve
jobs obviously brilliant, you know,

308
00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:58.180
had a lot of great
ideas. It would ultimately a

309
00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:00.760
lot of Tim Cook's job
behind the scenes was to

310
00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:03.910
actually take those great ideas
and make them into something.

311
00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:07.360
Right. And when, you know,
he was an automatic heir

312
00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:10.330
to the throne when jobs
left, you know, partly because

313
00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:13.870
they just been working so
long together, but there are

314
00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:15.820
other roles that are important.
You know, you want to

315
00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:18.490
make sure that you have
a sales lead. You know,

316
00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:21.300
that's probably not the same
person. It might be the

317
00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:25.030
same. Okay. So you're saying
that people should find a

318
00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:27.850
partner that has a different
skill sets, but also our

319
00:17:27.850 --> 00:17:33.010
complimentary complimentary partners are important.
Absolutely. No one, no one

320
00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:36.430
can do anything in this
world alone, ultimately, and that

321
00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:40.120
is doubly true of a
startup. You absolutely need to

322
00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:45.160
have a say the visionary,
the geek, the sales lead,

323
00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:47.350
if you're making a product,
you know, is there someone

324
00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:51.510
on your team who has
manufacturing experience? You know, who's

325
00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:55.080
a product specialist, you know,
there, there are a few

326
00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:58.350
key roles that you absolutely
have to have on board,

327
00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:01.260
you know, in order to
be successful. And it's rare

328
00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:05.070
that all of those talents
that all have any talents

329
00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:07.980
exist within one person, you
know, there's a reason why,

330
00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:11.190
for example, at the circus,
there's someone who is Elian

331
00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:14.640
Tamer and someone who's on
the trapeze. These are usually

332
00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:18.990
not the same person, right.
Different skillsets to bring you

333
00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:23.270
in. I appreciate that. Okay.
So I've got a lot,

334
00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:24.890
I mean like, people like
to say that they're a

335
00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:27.590
founder, you know, like I
have offices everywhere, you know,

336
00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:31.850
they're all, you know, Panera
bread locations, but you know,

337
00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:36.800
it's my startup right. Offices
nationwide, you know, and if

338
00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:39.380
you register a domain while
you're in San Francisco, you're

339
00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:42.530
officially a founder, but how
do you graduate from side

340
00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:45.500
hustle to your main gig?
Well, you'll know that you

341
00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:48.860
have graduated from side hustle
to your main gig when

342
00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:53.050
you have the funds to
pay yourself a salary and

343
00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:56.600
potentially a few other people
too. So, you know, that's

344
00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:59.090
the trick, right? Is, you
know, are you able to

345
00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:03.560
sustain yourself enough, such that
you no longer need the

346
00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:06.500
side hustle? You know, while
you have the full time

347
00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:09.290
job, you know, to float
your expenses, but you're able

348
00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:14.300
to shift gears. So it's
actually happened to us where

349
00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:20.300
one of our team members,
she's a junior accounting professional,

350
00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:25.760
she's really smart, but her
Instagram influencer business has taken

351
00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:29.480
off such that she actually
makes more doing that now.

352
00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:32.330
And, and in the foreseeable
future, she can see that

353
00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:36.230
she can maintain, you know,
her, you know, her expenses

354
00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:39.650
and her lifestyle and doesn't
need her, her daytime gig

355
00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:43.730
anymore. So, yeah. Right. It's,
it's a new world we're

356
00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:46.520
living in. So that just
like, that's a thing that

357
00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:49.310
can just happen. You can
just slowly build your side

358
00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:51.920
business until it becomes your
main business. It becomes your

359
00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:54.050
main business. And, you know,
there are a few bridges

360
00:19:54.050 --> 00:19:56.390
to get there, right? You
know, if you want to

361
00:19:56.390 --> 00:20:00.830
accelerate that process, you can
actually find an accelerator online

362
00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:03.290
or incubator that can help
you start to connect to

363
00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:06.650
influencers. You can go to
the bank and see about,

364
00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:09.770
you know, getting a loan
and show them your expenses.

365
00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:12.800
There are a lot of
different programs out there that

366
00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:18.230
can help someone go from
side hustle to main gig.

367
00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:20.090
I don't have any experience
in this space, but of

368
00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:21.800
course I'm allowed to have
an opinion because I'm an

369
00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:25.040
armchair quarterback. I have felt
that this idea of an

370
00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:29.000
accelerator could potentially be problematic,
especially if we're trying to

371
00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:34.520
incubate and accelerate underrepresented groups
that they could get in

372
00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:38.180
so early that they take
huge amounts of someone's a

373
00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:40.760
company. Like I've seen people
on shark tank and they'll

374
00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:44.450
give them like $30,000 and
then they'll take half their

375
00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:47.800
company. And I'm thinking to
myself, that's like a friends

376
00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:49.750
and family round for someone
who has no friends or

377
00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:53.950
family, and for a modest
amount of like, you know,

378
00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:56.230
basically amount of money that
you'd buy a car with,

379
00:20:56.530 --> 00:21:00.730
they just took half your
company are accelerators, good things

380
00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:02.440
or bad things, or is
that just a shark tank

381
00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:05.070
is a bedroom. So shark
tank is a little bit

382
00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:07.740
of a distorted. I mean,
I went to business school,

383
00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:10.590
which definitely helped, but not
everyone needs to do that.

384
00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:14.220
My business, original business partner,
Roslyn mew, who's a contributor

385
00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:17.040
on the book, didn't go
to business school. And she

386
00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:20.100
was just as smart and
capable, maybe more so than

387
00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:24.000
I am, you know? Right.
So shark tank is fascinating

388
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.460
from that perspective is a
good way to learn, you

389
00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:28.920
know what that's like, but
it's, it's not really like

390
00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:32.190
that. And your investor, you
know, the right investors, especially

391
00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:35.010
at the seed round. We
know when it's early, when

392
00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:37.560
it's angel investors, like, you
know, they really want to

393
00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:39.780
get to know you as
a person. You know, they're

394
00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:41.850
not trying to grill you.
They're not trying to trick

395
00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:46.200
you. You know, look, there
are safer ways for an

396
00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:49.140
angel investor to make money,
right. Instead of giving you

397
00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:52.500
money, like you're probably going
to fail, right. Again, 90%

398
00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:55.050
of small businesses fail, you
know, they'd be better off

399
00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:59.760
just dumping that money into
an index fund. Right. You

400
00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:04.680
know, they are angel investors
seek out younger entrepreneurs because

401
00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:07.350
someone bet on them, right.
It's their way of giving

402
00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:09.690
back. And it's their way
of staying in the game.

403
00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:13.530
And so the best investors
have more to give than

404
00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:16.020
just money and want to,
they very much want to

405
00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:21.210
be there for you beyond
just a financial investment. The

406
00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:24.540
financial investment is important and
it's meaningful, you know, but

407
00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:27.660
ultimately with our angel investors,
I felt like, wow, you

408
00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:30.900
know, it's, you know, the
fact that these really successful

409
00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:34.200
people believe in me, gives
me a lot of self

410
00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:36.600
confidence and you know, the
best investors. And this is

411
00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:38.850
true of structuring. You know,
the reason why people say

412
00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:40.680
yes, even though they're like,
Oh, you know, I got

413
00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:43.380
to give 20% of my
company for like, you know,

414
00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:47.160
what feels like, you know,
$50,000 is because the investors

415
00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:50.550
on that show, you know,
have these amazing networks. Right.

416
00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:53.340
And they can, they can
provide not just money, but

417
00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:57.090
a distribution channel. Right. If
it's QVC, they can provide

418
00:22:57.090 --> 00:23:00.990
marketing support. You know, they
have vendor relationships, they can

419
00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:03.690
arrange for bank loans. Right.
So they know that they're

420
00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:09.060
going to get a whole
different other set of resources

421
00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:12.210
from this investor, beyond that
small amount, that's going to

422
00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:14.460
blow up their business if
they, if they play it.

423
00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:16.860
Right. And so they, they
get a bigger, you know,

424
00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:19.530
yeah. You know, maybe you
go from owning a hundred

425
00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:23.790
percent of your thing to
50% of your thing, but,

426
00:23:23.850 --> 00:23:26.850
you know, do you want
to own a hundred percent

427
00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:31.320
of like, you know, a
penny, you know? Right. You

428
00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:33.870
know, or do you want
to own 50% of a

429
00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:36.600
quarter? I see. So they
can go and pick up

430
00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:38.100
the phone and call toys
R us and have your

431
00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:40.170
stuff on the shelf before
toys R us went under

432
00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:42.960
like tomorrow because they know
the head of best buy

433
00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:44.490
or toys R us or
whatever. And that is a

434
00:23:44.490 --> 00:23:47.810
value. They, as the angel
investor in the incubator, that's

435
00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:49.880
why they are an accelerator.
They just, they pick up

436
00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:53.510
the phone and they call
the, the, the mover and

437
00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:56.380
suddenly your company blows up.
Right. Or they help you

438
00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:58.780
work through, okay. You know,
here's what, here's what you

439
00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:00.340
need to do. Here's what
you say. You're trying to

440
00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:02.890
do. You'll, let's work on
your business model. Let's work

441
00:24:02.890 --> 00:24:05.920
on your pricing. Let's figure
out vendors and suppliers for

442
00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:08.590
you. Oh. You know, we
actually need to pair you

443
00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:12.970
with another team member right.
To make this happen all

444
00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:16.360
together. So yeah. You just
get so much more with

445
00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:18.730
the right. With the, and
that's something to look for.

446
00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:21.090
I mean, the, the, you
know, there's good money and

447
00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:23.080
there's bad money. And one
of the things I talk

448
00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:25.180
about in the book, especially
as a woman, you know,

449
00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:28.900
look, you know, if someone
is, you know, using the

450
00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:31.300
opportunity to talk to you
about your business, to try

451
00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:34.090
to get in your pants,
like run in the opposite

452
00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:37.900
direction, because, you know, it's,
it's, you know, that person,

453
00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:41.650
isn't thinking in a clear,
rational way about your business.

454
00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:44.290
And if they're doing that
now they will continue to

455
00:24:44.290 --> 00:24:46.870
do that. And therefore, they're
not going to be that

456
00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:49.600
supporter and advisor that you
really need when it comes.

457
00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:52.390
I see. Now, one of
the things that you called

458
00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:54.880
out though in the chapter
on funding is a thing

459
00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:56.500
that I had never heard
about, but I like the

460
00:24:56.500 --> 00:25:00.130
sound of called steward ownership.
You know, I've always used

461
00:25:00.130 --> 00:25:02.890
the word stewardship, which is
kind of a benevolent kind

462
00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:05.930
of ownership. What is steward
ownership? And is it, is

463
00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:08.590
it finding its way to
the States? It's starting to

464
00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:11.080
find its way to the
state. So, you know, a

465
00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:16.030
great friend of mine who
runs the creative network actually

466
00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:18.850
wrote a blog post about
how, you know, look, he,

467
00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:23.320
you know, he got their
company into matter.vc, which is

468
00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:27.290
a really cool accelerator program,
but they felt like the

469
00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:30.700
people, the, the VC is
a venture capitalist and, you

470
00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:32.800
know, the angel investors that
they were talking to just

471
00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:35.380
really didn't get what they
were trying to do with

472
00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:37.540
the creative network, which is
to have, you know, really

473
00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:41.770
positive images that people could
buy. Right. And so, you

474
00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:45.580
know, they, weren't trying to,
you know, sell to people

475
00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:48.310
who didn't share the same
values. They really wanted, you

476
00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:52.270
know, images that inspire people.
So, you know, stewardship ownership

477
00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:57.040
is it's pretty common apparently
in Europe. And, you know,

478
00:25:57.130 --> 00:25:59.830
before, you know, in American
history, there's quite a bit

479
00:25:59.830 --> 00:26:01.750
of this, but the idea
of steward ownership is that

480
00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:07.090
companies should exist to do
something for society beyond just

481
00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:12.580
maximize profit. Right. And I
know that sounds crazy, but

482
00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:15.610
I think we can see
that just maximizing profit, you

483
00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:19.270
know, ultimately, you know, doesn't
lead to a healthy society.

484
00:26:19.270 --> 00:26:21.250
It doesn't even lead to
a healthy business. I mean,

485
00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:24.430
look at, look at Facebook,
right? That's a great example.

486
00:26:24.670 --> 00:26:29.140
Facebook did a great job
in, you know, selling a

487
00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:32.380
whole bunch of ads, but
ultimately, you know, people are

488
00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:35.920
feeling like, you know, when
I go into Facebook, I

489
00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:38.290
don't love what I see
in there. Right. It doesn't

490
00:26:38.290 --> 00:26:42.040
feel healthy. It feels toxic
at times. And so ultimately,

491
00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:46.320
even though they trying to
maximize for having as many

492
00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:49.590
people, you know, as much
content as possible on the

493
00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:53.160
platform, you know, they would,
if they had actually scaled

494
00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:55.230
back a little and said,
it's not just that we

495
00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:58.530
want the most amount of
stuff, we want the right

496
00:26:58.530 --> 00:27:04.850
stuff. Right. They wouldn't be
losing engagement Now not to

497
00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:09.020
get too political, but is
steward ownership, capitalist and socialist

498
00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:12.290
at the same time? Or
is it just acknowledging that

499
00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:17.300
not everything has to be
more money? I think it's

500
00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:20.810
pretty, it's still pretty capitalist,
right? It's, it's still, but

501
00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:23.270
you know, it's not, it's
not saying, so the model

502
00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:27.530
here, particularly in the United States
is that, you know, venture

503
00:27:27.530 --> 00:27:30.530
capitalists or angel investors, they'll
bet on a whole bunch

504
00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:33.110
of horses, right. With the
idea that one of those

505
00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:35.600
horses, one of those companies
is going to hit it

506
00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:38.210
big. And so everyone is
trying to be, or PR

507
00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:42.770
or present themselves as that
one. That's going to offset

508
00:27:42.770 --> 00:27:45.410
all of the losses right.
From all of the other

509
00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:47.720
ones. And so they want
to see the hockey stick,

510
00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:51.500
right? Meaning, you know, a,
a revenue stream that is

511
00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:54.470
going to take off and
get huge, right. A hundred

512
00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:57.410
X, a thousand to X,
you know, they're looking for

513
00:27:57.410 --> 00:28:00.260
really, what's called a really
big exit, right? So when

514
00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:03.710
you sell or you have
an IPO, like a big

515
00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:06.950
company like Twitter, or just
recently, Uber, you know, they're

516
00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:10.130
looking for that big, big
payoff because all of the

517
00:28:10.130 --> 00:28:13.520
other 90% of their, their
bets are likely to fail.

518
00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:19.100
Now, instead with ownership with
steward ownership, it's capped dividends,

519
00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:21.980
or they're sometimes called demand
dividends. And what it says

520
00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:24.680
is look, when, once you
reach, you know, a certain

521
00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:28.700
amount of revenue, you start
paying back the profits to

522
00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:32.360
the investors until they've received,
say five X or 10

523
00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:37.370
X, their initial investment. So
that does two things. You

524
00:28:37.370 --> 00:28:39.950
know, it means that the
investors get a pretty good

525
00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:42.830
return on their money, right?
That is, that is safer

526
00:28:42.930 --> 00:28:46.190
in many ways, this makes
it a safer bet for

527
00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:49.220
an investor, but it also
means that they don't have

528
00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:52.250
to push towards a sale.
It means that, you know,

529
00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:56.300
you can actually extend past
that five to seven average

530
00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:59.120
year. If you're a successful
business, you know, before you

531
00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:06.620
have to exit by either
acquisition or acquisition or IPO,

532
00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:09.200
you know, you can keep
your business quite a bit

533
00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:13.520
long And you cover the,
the full life cycle. You

534
00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:15.440
cover, you know, you have
two parts to the book,

535
00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:18.410
but you go all the
way through bootstrapping it, funding

536
00:29:18.410 --> 00:29:21.590
it, making a pitch deck,
how to deal with investors.

537
00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:24.080
You know, what, what the
investor expects of you kind

538
00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:28.790
of investor relations, spending, giving
your experience and yours and

539
00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:31.910
Ross experience running your businesses
and how to, you know,

540
00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:35.450
not burn too much cash
all the way out to

541
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:39.170
an exit strategy. And there
are, there are multiple potential

542
00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:44.170
exit strategies for your, for
your company. You talk about

543
00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:50.920
three three-way, exit IPO being
acquired, and you actually call

544
00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:55.140
out failing as a potential
exit. Failing is the most

545
00:29:55.140 --> 00:30:00.030
frequently occurring exit. Unfortunately, that's
why I called the book.

546
00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:03.300
Mechanical bull in part is
because it's such a wild

547
00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:06.540
ride one day, you think,
Oh my gosh, we made

548
00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:09.390
this incredible deal. We're going
to be rich. You know?

549
00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:10.590
And the next day we're
like, wow, you know, it

550
00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:12.330
was a great ride. You
know, we had a lot

551
00:30:12.330 --> 00:30:14.520
of fun. We did some
cool stuff. I'm like, it's

552
00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:18.390
over. Right. And it can
feel that way all the

553
00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:21.000
way through. I mean, even
at the point when we

554
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.840
were, you know, in conversations,
you know, with, you know,

555
00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:28.710
our eventual purchaser, our eventual
acquirer, I mean, there were

556
00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:30.840
points where we weren't sure
the deal was going to

557
00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:32.610
go through. I mean, that,
which is why I tried

558
00:30:32.610 --> 00:30:35.670
to cover the full life
cycle so that people feel

559
00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:38.340
like they have the tools
and the info, they need

560
00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:41.100
it at every stage to
actually get to the other

561
00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:44.400
side. You know, it is
it's. Yeah. It's a, it's

562
00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:49.080
a tough ride. Well, you
