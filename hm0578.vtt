<inaudible>. Hi, this is Scott

8
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.870
Hanselman. This is another episode
of Hansel minutes today. I'm

9
00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.970
talking with Tara Reed. She
is a ceo@appswithoutcode.com. She's worked

10
00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.610
at Microsoft and Google and
to Columbia and all over

11
00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.730
the place. And now she
is helping people make apps

12
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.460
without knowing how to code.
How are you? It's pretty

13
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.980
good. Thanks so much for
having me. I'm thrilled to

14
00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.990
talk to you because you
know, everyone is out there

15
00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.000
saying we should learn how
to code these people, how

16
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.330
to code, and maybe that's
not the right way to

17
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.390
go about things. I mean,
I think more than anything,

18
00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.630
we should teach people how
to be great problem solvers

19
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.860
and to really understand logic
and solving problems with logic.

20
00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.900
Sometimes that looks like doing
it with code. Sometimes it

21
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.010
doesn't. Yeah, it seems like
we should be teaching people

22
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.650
how to think, you know
what I've done done podcasts

23
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.370
with people about systems thinking,
and that's a way to

24
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:39.140
think. Absolutely it definitely is.
So I primarily work with

25
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.400
people who self identify as
nontechnical, which, you know, can

26
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.940
mean a lot of different
things, but for primarily for

27
00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.040
people who are not proficient
enough in writing code such

28
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.690
that they can, they have
an app idea, but they

29
00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.200
can't crank it out immediately
and build it really quickly.

30
00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.360
And that could be people
who are really good at

31
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.150
writing code. They just don't
have the time or want

32
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.450
to invest all the time
and building and writing new

33
00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.190
code for their idea when
they don't even know if

34
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.340
it's something that people want.
And it could be someone

35
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.570
who totally doesn't know code
at all. Why do people

36
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.020
do people choose to self
identify for like, I don't,

37
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.060
I'm not technical. It's almost
seems like it's a defensive

38
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.320
maneuver. Some sometimes it is
sometimes it's if people feel

39
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.700
insecure about not being technical
in a, in the tech

40
00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.550
industry. And so, and I
think a lot of, a

41
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:38.060
lot of unintentional shame gets
put on people inside of

42
00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.180
tech companies who are not
the developers, right? What all

43
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.220
of those roles, all roles
inside of a company are

44
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.190
super important. But I think
that people feel maybe embarrassed

45
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.720
that they don't know how
to write code. And so

46
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.950
they call themselves nontechnical. I'm
not even sure what that

47
00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.040
means. Exactly. Cause there are
some pretty technical people who

48
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.290
also don't, you know, are
not developers. So, you know,

49
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.080
I think people sometimes will,
will say that and sort

50
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.660
of put themselves down or
turn it to protect themselves

51
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.300
as an insecurity thing. Yeah.
That's what I've seen. I

52
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.280
wonder why people choose to
do that and where that

53
00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.340
started. I mean, I recognize
that people who know how

54
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.740
to code are proud of
it. And I know that

55
00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.190
I'm excited to have that,
that sense of empowerment, that

56
00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.070
why we have set up
the system by which we

57
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.600
disempower people who can't do
that, as opposed to, I

58
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.310
mean, I think inside of
a tech company, you know,

59
00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.890
as you mentioned, I've worked
at some big ones, you

60
00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.420
know, there's a hierarchy. It
seems of the people who

61
00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.330
work there with developers largely
at the top, particularly at

62
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.170
startups. Right. And I think
that that sort of some

63
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.540
of where it comes from,
but I think that the

64
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.400
negative effect is that people
who are in non developer

65
00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.360
roles inside of a company,
then feel like the kind

66
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.570
of critical thinking that comes
with being a developer is

67
00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.140
not for them. They can't
do it. And it actually,

68
00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.420
I think, ends up biting
the developers in the butt

69
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.750
because then they get asked
all sorts of questions. Some

70
00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.050
of them being relatively simple
questions that someone could have

71
00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.150
figured out on their own,
or if they had a

72
00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.940
little bit of knowledge about
code or about, you know,

73
00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.660
just technology in general, they
could've asked a more directed

74
00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.900
question. They could've spoke the
developer's language a little bit

75
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.660
better. And I think it
kind of that, that stigma

76
00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.020
and that divide between technical
and nontechnical actually prevents us

77
00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.190
from really effectively communicating. That's
interesting that you point out

78
00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.020
that it's as much about
being technical as it is

79
00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.370
about communicating with the technical
people. It's almost like that

80
00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.330
frustration with talking to programmers.
It causes one to just

81
00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.810
say, ah, I'm not technical.
Absolutely. And you know, so

82
00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.690
I run a program it's
called apps, that code bootcamp.

83
00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.080
And I mainly work with
people who identify as nontechnical.

84
00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.470
And a lot of them
have a lot of fear

85
00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.510
around talking to a developer
that developer not understanding what

86
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.700
it is that they were
trying to say. So again,

87
00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.300
communication, and then getting a
result from their product. That

88
00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.060
just totally wasn't what they
wanted or what they were

89
00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.000
trying to communicate and feeling
like they've wasted their money

90
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.490
or their time working with
that person. You know, that's,

91
00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.720
that's one of the results
of us having this divide

92
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:24.780
between technical and nontechnical as
well. So when a non

93
00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.380
technical or person who's not
coding, or actually, you know,

94
00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.690
I'm just realizing it, it's
not just non technical, but

95
00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:32.910
it's people who may not
have experience in a particular

96
00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.090
platform. For example, you might
be listening to this podcast

97
00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.520
and you've got 20 years
in technology that you've never

98
00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.850
made an iPhone app. Yeah.
Yeah. People who don't have

99
00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:45.930
experience in a particular platform
or people who are validating

100
00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:50.070
an idea and know that
the faster they can validate

101
00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:53.610
that the better off they'll
be. And that includes even

102
00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:56.430
people who have experience in
that particular platform who want

103
00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.610
to build in a fraction
of the time, make sure

104
00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.530
they can make money from
it. And then, okay, we'll

105
00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:04.330
go back and, and do
the coding work. That's interesting.

106
00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.210
How important is it to
validate the idea? I mean,

107
00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:10.090
I assume the point of
validating idea is to, to

108
00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:11.970
know when to bail, cause
you don't wanna, you know,

109
00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:14.050
you see these people on
shark tank that are like,

110
00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:16.090
I've been putting 35 years
in a million dollars and

111
00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:18.220
I mortgaged our house and
then they're off the shark

112
00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:21.730
tank and it's like, that's
so sad. Yeah, absolutely. You

113
00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:24.340
definitely need to know when
to bail, but also like

114
00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.790
none of us get our
ideas right. The first time.

115
00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.880
And we know this as
well for, for folks who

116
00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.670
are listening, who work at
big companies, you definitely know

117
00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:35.740
this. We just don't really
talk about it inside of

118
00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:39.070
company space. So that's why
we continuously iterate on products.

119
00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:41.980
That's why we have support
teams and why support teams

120
00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:46.030
often sort of rotate with
the teams because the engineers

121
00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:48.670
need to see what people
are saying and support tickets

122
00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:50.500
and like, Oh, I didn't
think that this feature would

123
00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:53.350
be really confusing to all
the consumers, but it actually

124
00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:56.200
ended up being really confusing.
You know, all those things,

125
00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:58.540
the same thing happens when
you build a new product

126
00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:03.130
except it's magnified, right. There
could be particular features you

127
00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:05.290
thought were going to be
really, really important. Actually I

128
00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:09.130
remember my first startup that
I launched was called collector

129
00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:12.310
and I thought that it
was an art recommendation service.

130
00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.100
And I thought that it
was going to be really

131
00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.050
important to, I wanted to
still have a little bit

132
00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:19.270
of a human touch in
there in addition to a

133
00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:22.660
recommendation algorithm. And I wanted
people to be able to

134
00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:25.900
interact somewhat with like a
personal stylist for their walls.

135
00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:27.660
And that was gonna be
so important that people would

136
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:29.740
be able to video chat
and that we have video

137
00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:33.430
is a really, really critical
component of the platform. And

138
00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:36.100
I couldn't get anyone to
get on video chat. Right.

139
00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:38.320
It just turned out the
people who didn't know much

140
00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:41.380
about art. They were totally
intimidated by the idea of

141
00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:43.960
talking to someone who knew
a lot about art. And

142
00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.330
if I had gone out
and spent a lot of

143
00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:49.750
time building the best, you
know, video integrated platform, I

144
00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:52.570
would have totally wasted my
time. So most of us

145
00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:55.270
don't get it exactly right.
The vision we have of

146
00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:58.450
exactly how the product should
look is not spot on

147
00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:00.850
when we first start. And
so there may be tools

148
00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:03.550
you want to use to
just quickly build something. And

149
00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:06.070
when I say quickly, you
know, the tools that I

150
00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:08.440
teach people how to build
apps without code on these

151
00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:12.060
days, developers picked him up,
you know, and even if

152
00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:14.350
in a fraction of the
time. So if you can

153
00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:17.140
build your entire app in
a day or two and

154
00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:19.060
then just get it out
there. And when I say

155
00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:21.550
build, I mean from idea
to push to the app

156
00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:25.150
store in a day or
two, why not make sure

157
00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:28.030
that people want it, you've
got the core features in

158
00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:30.520
place, and then you can
make quick changes as opposed

159
00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:32.920
to, you know, really investing
in a lot of technical

160
00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:37.360
debt. Why do people feel
the need to put something

161
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.060
out that's super polished and
why are people so kind

162
00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:42.640
of ashamed for lack of
a better word of putting

163
00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:45.580
out a website or an
app that isn't clean. It's

164
00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:47.920
almost like when we were
kids and we were told

165
00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:49.990
to write a paper, we're
always ashamed of that first

166
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:51.940
draft to the point where
you almost deny that it

167
00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:56.070
exists. Absolutely. I mean, all
of us want to look

168
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:59.520
good, right? Like that's all
centered in just a human

169
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:03.870
instinct to look good, but
a good friend of mine,

170
00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:06.870
he says, hell is building
fancy stuff that nobody uses.

171
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:10.680
It's, it's fun. Okay. It
looks really great, but nobody

172
00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:13.440
cares. And that's literally the
worst. But if you were

173
00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:16.590
a product developer and I
don't even, I, you say

174
00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:19.050
product developer, meaning whether you
code or not, you can

175
00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:24.300
still put out products. That's
the worst building, fancy stuff.

176
00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:29.390
Nobody uses The, you've got
a great blog post called

177
00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:33.290
a, my website isn't ready
to launch yet. And you

178
00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:35.960
kind of explore that idea
of that, that self doubt.

179
00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:38.480
It seems like we need
to remind people that fail

180
00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:41.360
fast fail often is how
you get things done these

181
00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:45.050
days. Yeah, absolutely. I don't
know if you guys have

182
00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:48.050
read or folks who are
listening have read outliers by

183
00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:54.140
Malcolm Gladwell. It's actually a
really good illustration of, you

184
00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:56.450
know, the things and the
people that we see as

185
00:09:56.450 --> 00:10:01.430
being really successful are yes,
successful, but for a variety

186
00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:04.190
of reasons, the main one
being that they've just had

187
00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:07.520
a ton of practice her
age and that practice can

188
00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:10.730
be launching something and failing
it and then launching it

189
00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:13.100
again and getting it a
little bit better. But they're

190
00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:16.850
constantly putting themselves out there.
And that extends from like

191
00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:20.630
sports players where there's always
practicing to developers where they're

192
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:23.900
just like always launching things
or any kind of entrepreneur

193
00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:28.970
really where you're always launching
things and you are not

194
00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:32.030
going to hit that sort
of success space, unless you're

195
00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:34.340
always putting stuff out there.
Some of those things will

196
00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:36.560
be failures and some of
them things, some of the

197
00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.600
things will be successes. And
that's how you get there

198
00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:42.170
by just putting a bunch
out there. Sometimes I've heard,

199
00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:45.350
I've seen like medium posts
or blogs where someone says,

200
00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.900
you know, put out a
website that's super basic with

201
00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:50.960
a sign up sheet. Even
if the product doesn't exist

202
00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:54.050
in order to gauge interest
in the product. And if

203
00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:56.090
people sign up, then you'll
know, well, a thousand people

204
00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:59.060
signed up, I should definitely,
you know, start building this

205
00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:02.450
thing does that seems like
a powerful life hack, but

206
00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:04.580
it also seems like it
might be a little disingenuous.

207
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.720
No, I think it's really
flat. I do that. And

208
00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:11.030
I, and I instruct people
to do that as well.

209
00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:15.470
And you know, the reason
why is because it, for

210
00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:17.390
it to work, it has
to be accompanied by a

211
00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:21.530
solid marketing strategy is often
the piece, right? A lot

212
00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:23.890
of people say, just build
your website and see if

213
00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:25.820
people sign up. Well, like
that's not really how it

214
00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:28.730
happens, right? Like if you
build a website, you have

215
00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:30.500
to do a lot of
work to get people to

216
00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:32.240
know about your website and
get them to sign up,

217
00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:36.440
right. That's where the marketing
piece comes in and then

218
00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:39.110
you have to leverage. So
what I usually tell people

219
00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:41.240
to do is have people
sign up and get on

220
00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:44.300
the waiting list for your
product. And what it allows

221
00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:46.460
you to do is slowly
take people off of the

222
00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:49.640
waiting list and to kind
of manage your workload. And

223
00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:51.740
when I say slowly, I
mean, literally you can take

224
00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:54.340
people off five people, a
time, 10 people at a

225
00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:58.090
time to use your product.
It also is a smart

226
00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:01.600
marketing strategy because not only
does it manage your workload,

227
00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:05.470
but it also create some
urgency, right? People are like,

228
00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:07.180
Oh, there's a wait list
for this. This might be

229
00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:10.990
cool. And it's, it's smart
from a marketing perspective as

230
00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:14.230
well. So I think it's
a great way to go.

231
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:16.180
And it allows you to
see if anyone's interested. It

232
00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:18.670
allows you to see like,
is the way I'm describing

233
00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:21.460
this, something that resonates with
people or am I totally

234
00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:23.890
describing it in a way
where no one cares? All

235
00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:26.590
right, let me play around
and tweak the language. Let

236
00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:28.090
me tweak some of the
things that are on the

237
00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:30.100
site and see if I
can kind of get something

238
00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:32.320
that resonates with people a
bit better. And then once

239
00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.660
you have people signing up,
then you kind of treat

240
00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:39.970
your signup customers as investors.
I'm a huge advocate for

241
00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:43.060
building products where you charge
people upfront instead of having,

242
00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:47.200
you know, completely freebie app
products. But what you're able

243
00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:49.060
to do is see like,
is anybody gonna pay for

244
00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:51.430
this thing? And then what
you put yourself in as

245
00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:54.130
a position where you don't
have to go begging and

246
00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:57.940
crawling to an investor for
money, because you've used your

247
00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:00.850
customers as kind of some
of your early quote unquote

248
00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:06.060
investors for the price. Interesting.
Someone told me about the

249
00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:09.270
theory of a thousand true
fans. I heard about this,

250
00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:12.330
right? So you were telling
me that your early people,

251
00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:15.000
your early, you know, people
who bet on you and

252
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.850
your idea early, really aren't
just their investors. They are

253
00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:19.530
your fans and they are
the ones that can also

254
00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:21.540
help you potentially pivot if
you need to make a

255
00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:26.160
change. Absolutely, absolutely. So we
hear this term pivot a

256
00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.290
lot, and sometimes you see
these things on, on, on

257
00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:30.750
hacker news and you see
it on like Silicon Valley

258
00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:34.260
on that TV show where
these things become buzzwords though.

259
00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.990
But you, you, you're not
saying that pivoting is a

260
00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:40.230
bad thing. If you are
going to fail on something.

261
00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:43.080
No, I think pivoting is
a great thing. The one

262
00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:47.040
challenge is I see people
fall into two camps either.

263
00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:50.310
They're not pivoting at all.
So they're just completely stuck

264
00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:52.830
on this one idea that
they have in their head.

265
00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:56.070
And usually those people are
not actually getting much traction

266
00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:59.160
on their idea, whether that's
development, traction, they're just not

267
00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.470
getting much built or they're
not getting a lot of

268
00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:03.720
customer traction because they're too
scared to put it out

269
00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:05.970
there. So usually the people
who are really, really attached

270
00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:08.010
to their idea, they're not
making a lot of progress

271
00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:11.910
or there's people who have
heard about this concept of

272
00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:16.140
pivoting and are pivoting like
crazy before they even get

273
00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:18.150
any real customer feedback. Like
every time they get a

274
00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:21.330
new idea, there's a pivot.
And so I think that

275
00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:24.300
both of those extremes are
not where you want to

276
00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:26.040
be. You don't want to
be pivoting every time you

277
00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:28.260
have a new idea. All
of your pivots should be

278
00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.450
grounded in some of that
feedback that you get from

279
00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:34.050
your first thousand true fans,
right? If you're seeing really

280
00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:36.420
clear trends on things that
are confusing to people or

281
00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:40.320
things that people want, et
cetera, you should be pivoting

282
00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.030
around those, but not just
when you get a new

283
00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:45.720
idea. So it sounds like
whether you're technical or not,

284
00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:47.490
all of the decisions that
you make need to be

285
00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:49.560
kind of rooted in content,
for lack of a better

286
00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:51.890
word, conscious thought, like there
has to be a reason

287
00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:54.260
there has to be data.
There has to be, you

288
00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.330
know, research behind the reasons
that you do what you

289
00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:59.290
do. I wouldn't even go
even further to say rooted

290
00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:04.000
in something that multiple customers
have said. Or, and when

291
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.740
I say said, I don't
mean they actually have to

292
00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:09.910
say those words, sometimes customers
of technology products, they don't

293
00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:12.430
know how to articulate what
they want, but they can

294
00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:14.740
tell you by not clicking
on that thing, you want

295
00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:17.830
them to click on, right?
So that's where the data

296
00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:20.350
comes in. But it's mainly
because of something the customer

297
00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:22.540
said, if you use the
word said in a little

298
00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:27.280
bit more of a loose
Now, what about people who

299
00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:30.670
have a co founder? And
they're two people, does it

300
00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:32.830
always need to be like
one bill Gates and one

301
00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:35.440
bomber where one's technical and
one's not, or can tune

302
00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:37.870
on technical founders to work
on a startup idea together.

303
00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:41.170
I think two nontechnical founders
can definitely work on a

304
00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:44.500
startup idea together. And I
think too technical folks can

305
00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:47.380
as well. I think that
what, for me, as an

306
00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:51.190
entrepreneur, what's really important is
to constantly be working with

307
00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:55.540
coaches to develop skills that
I don't have, or that

308
00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:57.970
I'm a little bit weak
on. And sometimes that means

309
00:15:57.970 --> 00:16:01.030
that like I'm bartering with
a friend, right? So I,

310
00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:03.580
for example, am not a
designer and there are designers

311
00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:06.130
on my team. And a
couple of months ago, I

312
00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:10.000
wanted to just have a
better grasp on managing my

313
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.980
designers and be able to
do a better job as

314
00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:15.220
a manager there and as
a CEO. And so I

315
00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:18.160
hired and sort of bartered
with a friend of mine

316
00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:21.970
who used to work on
his name, Zander Pollock, used

317
00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:25.510
to work on the Gmail
team. And he taught me

318
00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:28.060
about the Google ventures, design
sprint. And so I have

319
00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:31.090
a better grasp on what
it looks like to design

320
00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:33.100
a product because I've rolled
up my sleeves and gone

321
00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:35.710
through that process. And I
am not a designer. I'm

322
00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:38.110
not the designated designer on
that team, but it doesn't

323
00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:42.190
mean that I can't learn
design. And that is a

324
00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:44.440
really good way. If you
have two technical people to

325
00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:47.500
nontechnical people where you can
sort of balance some things

326
00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:49.930
out. But I think that
if you are launching a

327
00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:52.630
product, launching a company, you
should always be figuring out

328
00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:56.230
how you can learn things
and bring on coaches for

329
00:16:56.230 --> 00:17:00.760
lack of better word, to
help you with that. Yeah,

330
00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:03.250
but Google ventures, design sprint,
and I'll have links to

331
00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:06.520
all of this in the
show notes, is it gv.com/sprint?

332
00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:10.390
It's aiming to provide a
shortcut because you've got your

333
00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:12.370
idea. You're going to build
your idea, you'll launch your

334
00:17:12.370 --> 00:17:14.350
idea. And then you take
information and you learn, and

335
00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:18.280
then you kind of really
refine that idea. The intent

336
00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:20.800
is with these design sprints
is to tighten that up,

337
00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:25.720
that inner loop and make
it even even quicker. So

338
00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:28.720
what tools do people people
use? I know that you

339
00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:31.450
have a, a, a toolkit
that people can go up

340
00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:34.960
and download. They'll get a
free ebook on apps without

341
00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:38.860
code toolkit. Are you intending
that people use like drag

342
00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:41.230
and drop tools to create
prototypes or are they really

343
00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:44.650
making apps in the, in
the well, in this, in

344
00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:46.360
the sense that I think
about them as it being

345
00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:50.520
applications? Absolutely. So what I'm
talking are people building fully

346
00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:54.210
functioning apps. So not just
prototypes where you click it,

347
00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:56.610
but you can actually save
a database of information, et

348
00:17:56.610 --> 00:18:00.090
cetera. So there are a
couple different types of tools

349
00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:04.290
out there. The one that
I recommend to people who

350
00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:06.690
are a little bit more
on the tech savvy side

351
00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:10.170
is called bubble bubble dot
I S is the website.

352
00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:15.420
And it's definitely the most
robust tool out there at

353
00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:18.150
least right now as we
speak. And, but there are

354
00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:21.960
a ton others, dozens tend
to dozens of others and

355
00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:26.370
bubble has a couple core
tabs. I'll kind of describe

356
00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:28.350
this to you, but you're
welcome to go check out

357
00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:32.240
the website. This is a
bubble dot I S for

358
00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:36.170
people that are listening. Exactly.
And so the, there is

359
00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:39.500
a design tab and that
design tab just looks like

360
00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:42.590
a regular drag drop editor.
So you drag and drop

361
00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:45.200
shapes on the page and
different elements on the page.

362
00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:51.110
And there's some more sophisticated
design work that you can

363
00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:52.490
do there, but it looks
like more or less a

364
00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:55.910
drag and drop interface. And
then there is a database

365
00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:58.340
tab, and this is where
you set up your database,

366
00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:01.190
however you want. So you've
got free reign to set

367
00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:04.640
up the database with whatever
structure that you need, and

368
00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:08.870
you set up your database
too, and you can always

369
00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:11.510
change it there, the data
tab. And then there's a

370
00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:13.760
third tab, which is the
workflow tab. And for the

371
00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:17.000
most part, this is where
the replacement of the code

372
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.610
happens. And I usually tell
people, you know, you're still

373
00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:22.850
programming. You're just doing it
in a different language. Really

374
00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:26.060
what bubble has built is
their own programming language. It's

375
00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:31.460
just in, you know, conversational
English as opposed to anything

376
00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:34.220
else. And so what it
looks like is like a

377
00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:37.070
really, really simple example I
give to beginners is like,

378
00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:40.070
when the user clicks this
button, then log them in.

379
00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:43.160
And it literally says that.
And then it'll ask you

380
00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:46.850
some followup questions where you
put certain, you know, pieces

381
00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:49.340
of information around what happens
when you loved them it,

382
00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:51.890
and to allow them in
using the email that they

383
00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:53.810
typed into the email field,
in the password that they

384
00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:56.690
typed into the password field.
And when you use the

385
00:19:56.690 --> 00:20:00.560
log them in function in
bubble, it already knows that

386
00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:02.990
if it doesn't match up
to the password they have

387
00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:06.140
on file, it will give
a certain, you know, responses,

388
00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:08.420
sorry, that password doesn't match.
We don't have an account

389
00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:11.270
that way, and you can
change the messaging that you

390
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:13.250
want, but it kind of
has that logic set up.

391
00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:16.310
And so it's just really,
if this, then that logic

392
00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:18.770
and you can get, that's
a really simple example, but

393
00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:21.410
you can get really robust
with this and build algorithms

394
00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:24.770
and all sorts of things
here on the platform. I'm

395
00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:28.910
just using logic, but it's
written in conversational English statements

396
00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:33.380
as opposed to in a
different programming language. Interesting. So

397
00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:36.140
it sounds like for kind
of, you know, classic web

398
00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:39.650
text boxes, over data or
apps with maps and alerts

399
00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:41.600
and the kinds of things
that we see all the

400
00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:44.390
time, this could get, you
know, 80, 90% of the

401
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:49.060
people, quite, quite a lot
functionality. It's got male champion,

402
00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:52.680
Scott search engines and integrations
all built in. Yeah, absolutely.

403
00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:55.170
And then let's say, for
example, you wanted to plug

404
00:20:55.170 --> 00:20:58.920
in and pull in some
API connections. You can be

405
00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:02.340
that too. So it gets
people, a lot of the

406
00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:05.070
functionality that they have for
really basic apps. And then

407
00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:07.080
there are other tools out
there, like, let's say that

408
00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:09.930
you wanted to build a
video game without code. There's

409
00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:12.660
a tool called stencil that
allows you to do that.

410
00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:17.220
If you wanted to build
artificial intelligence chatbots, there's a

411
00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:20.430
tool called motion.ai. So there
were a couple, you know,

412
00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:25.650
specific functionality kind of tools
that focus on a different

413
00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:28.080
functionality, depending on what you're
trying to do there. And

414
00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:29.640
in there, a lot of
things that you still can't

415
00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.950
build without code these days,
right? And by the way,

416
00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:35.880
all of these platforms are
built with code, right? Just

417
00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:38.490
with interfaces that allow you
to build them without code.

418
00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:41.090
So oftentimes I get people
saying like, well, does this

419
00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:43.050
mean that we don't need
code anymore? And like, the

420
00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:46.140
answer is absolutely. That's not
what it means. It just

421
00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:49.770
opens up for, you know,
all the developers out there

422
00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:52.020
who have friends asking them
all the time to build

423
00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:54.780
their app idea. It allows
you to direct them to

424
00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:57.420
a place where they can
get started and make sure

425
00:21:57.420 --> 00:21:59.910
that this is something that
people want on their own.

426
00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:02.610
And then you kind of
come in once it's validated

427
00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:05.250
and ready for you, as
opposed to having all of

428
00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:08.550
your friends, ask you. And
Becky, That is a really

429
00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:11.220
interesting point at the same
time though. How do you,

430
00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:13.260
let's just use you as
an example, you know, you've

431
00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:18.060
launched your businesses, you've pivoted
on some sold some, but

432
00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:21.330
at the same time, aren't
you becoming technical, like maybe

433
00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:23.460
you'll wake up one day
and you'll be a coder

434
00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:25.830
and not even realize it.
If you're using bubbles successfully,

435
00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:28.650
you're probably coding. Now. You're
just not coding in a

436
00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:31.710
language that most people are
familiar with. Yeah, that's absolutely

437
00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:35.340
right. So in a lot
of ways you become technical.

438
00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:36.960
And I think that there
are, when we talk about

439
00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:40.620
technical, whatever, that means, they're
kind of different layers to

440
00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:44.730
that and different degrees with
which you are technical, but

441
00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:48.930
at least you become far
more technical than you once

442
00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:53.520
were. And that allows you
to do as a quote,

443
00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:55.200
unquote, non technical person allows
you to do a lot

444
00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:59.310
of things. One of which
is to take a first

445
00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:02.160
idea for stab of an
idea and a product that

446
00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:05.460
you've built, validate it, and
then bring it to someone

447
00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:08.610
who does write code to
then have them layer on.

448
00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:12.210
And sometimes people have, we'll
continue using a platform like

449
00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:17.070
bubble and other times. So
because you can layer code

450
00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:19.500
on top of it. So
you can layer Java or

451
00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:22.290
some other things on top
of bubble, or you can

452
00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:25.890
create your own API connections
using code. So it's not

453
00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:30.000
just for people who write
code or you can just

454
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.780
completely move off of it
and work on your own

455
00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:38.610
platform. Interesting. Okay. So you're
not necessarily looking at the

456
00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:41.520
internals of HTTP and doing
it, but you know, what

457
00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:46.580
an API is, right. That
sense. So then, you know,

458
00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:50.120
becoming technical can just be,
even being an enthusiast or

459
00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:54.620
someone who knows what MailChimp
is and how MailChimp fits

460
00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:56.930
into a solution without having
to know the internals of

461
00:23:56.930 --> 00:23:59.590
the API that talk to
MailChimp. Absolutely. And I think

462
00:23:59.590 --> 00:24:02.650
that that's, what's happening. The
industry, interesting thing that's happening

463
00:24:02.650 --> 00:24:04.720
in the industry is that
there are a lot of

464
00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:07.810
tools popping up that can
allow you to be technical

465
00:24:07.810 --> 00:24:10.270
without knowing the ins and
outs. Like, for example, if

466
00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:13.720
I want to do web
scraping of a website, there

467
00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:16.210
are clear web scraping tools
that I can use that

468
00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:18.580
don't require me to know
any code. I literally have

469
00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:21.910
click interfaces where I can
click on all the different

470
00:24:21.910 --> 00:24:23.980
elements of a page, set
it up, such that it

471
00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:26.290
scrapes it. And then I
know that there is an

472
00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:29.260
API connection in bubble. I
maybe don't know anything more

473
00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:31.570
than that. I just know
what's called an API. And

474
00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:34.000
what it'll do is it'll
pull in what I just

475
00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.880
web scraped into my app.
And that's all I need

476
00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:39.130
to know in order for
that to actually get done

477
00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:42.430
and set up. Right? Yeah.
So, so pulling this all

478
00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:44.710
the way back to the
initial kind of couple of

479
00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:47.440
statements where we talked about
how everyone is out there,

480
00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:50.350
focusing on people, learning to
code, there is a risk

481
00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:52.330
that someone might spend all
this time trying to figure

482
00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:55.180
out what a four loop
is or how HTML works.

483
00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:58.240
But they're missing the big
picture about how, how humans

484
00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:00.760
interact with apps in the
app store and how marketing

485
00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:04.420
is important in business development
and business plans are important

486
00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:07.180
as well. Oh yeah. I
mean, I find that the

487
00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:11.230
developers who join my programs
and boot camps, they're not

488
00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:14.110
coming because they don't know
how to code they're coming

489
00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:16.300
because they realize that even
if they do code the

490
00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:19.180
most perfect app, you know,
it's not going to get

491
00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:21.580
marketed itself. It's not going
to have a soft business

492
00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:24.580
model on its own. And
so those are all equally

493
00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:28.240
important pieces of the puzzle.
On top of that, I

494
00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:32.200
think that there are different
scenarios for learning to write

495
00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:35.290
code if you want to
learn to code, because you're

496
00:25:35.290 --> 00:25:38.260
excited about the intellectual challenge
of it. That's what you

497
00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:40.420
should, you definitely should learn
to write code if you

498
00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:42.310
want to learn code, because
you want to get a

499
00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:44.980
job working at like a
nine to five job working

500
00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:47.410
in tech, and you definitely
should write code. You're not

501
00:25:47.410 --> 00:25:49.840
going to come into the
conversation in the interview saying,

502
00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:51.550
I built apps for that
code. At least it's not

503
00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:54.640
today. And, but if you
have an idea for a

504
00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:58.000
startup and you don't write
code, it does not always

505
00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.610
benefit you to go say,
all right, well, I've got

506
00:26:00.610 --> 00:26:02.680
to go learn code because
by the time you get

507
00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:07.570
proficient enough to build a
robust and sophisticated app, the

508
00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:10.720
idea may not be relevant
anymore. Someone else has done

509
00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:13.720
it. And so if you
need speed on your side,

510
00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:15.700
it makes a lot of
sense to you. Some of

511
00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:20.290
these emerging alternatives. Interesting. It
seems like people could get,

512
00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:23.680
could get caught up in
trying to learn to code

513
00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:26.110
and miss the, the forest
for the trees when the,

514
00:26:26.110 --> 00:26:28.270
really the they're trying to
ship a solution, right. Not

515
00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:32.380
know how to code. Right.
And interesting. So people can

516
00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:38.980
get all of your resources@appswithoutcode.com.
You've got a bootcamp, you've

517
00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:41.590
got a blog. You've got
even a Ted talk that

518
00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:44.130
people can watch where it
kind of all this. Yeah,

519
00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:47.280
absolutely. The Ted talk turned
out pretty well. How did

520
00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:52.580
that happen? So I had
been blogging about my experience

521
00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:56.660
building apps without code for
a while. And I think

522
00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:58.910
I had like a hundred
subscribers. I w I was

523
00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:03.590
mainly talking to myself and,
but, but there were people

524
00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:06.740
who were just so enthusiastic
about it and it offered

525
00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:09.110
up an opportunity for them
that they didn't even think

526
00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:12.170
was possible. And so from
that, I got an invitation

527
00:27:12.170 --> 00:27:15.440
to do that TEDx talk.
And after that really got

528
00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:18.680
a lot more feedback on
the idea and a lot

529
00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:22.460
of interest in it good
and bad, right? Like some

530
00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:26.120
people hate this as an
idea, but I think it's

531
00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:31.790
really empowering for most people
more than anything, You know?

532
00:27:31.790 --> 00:27:33.860
And I liked that. You
said empowering. It's actually one

533
00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:37.370
of my favorite words, because
I think that what, what

534
00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:41.690
people who are technical have
or feel, I know I

535
00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:43.670
do is a sense of,
I can do it a

536
00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:46.850
sense of power. And you
know, in this, in this

537
00:27:46.910 --> 00:27:48.500
kind of the state of
the world today, so many

538
00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:50.330
people feel like they don't
have power, whether it be

539
00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:52.820
over their job or their
life or their situation. What's

540
00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:56.360
so fun about being a
techie techie. I want to

541
00:27:56.360 --> 00:28:00.440
include both nontechnical and technical
people, you know, enthusiasts is

542
00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:02.420
that sense of power. And
it sounds like that's what

543
00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:05.300
you're trying to get people
to realize that they are

544
00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:09.110
powerful and they can do
this. Exactly. That's very cool.

545
00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:11.360
Well, thanks so much for
chatting with me today. Absolutely.

546
00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:14.810
Thanks for having me. This
has been another episode of

547
00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:17.090
Hanselminutes and we'll see you
again next week.
