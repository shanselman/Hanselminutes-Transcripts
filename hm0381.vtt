talks with Pete Brown about
the upcoming windows 8.1 update.

10
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.140
Hi, this is Scott Hanselman.
This is another episode of

11
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.480
Hansel minutes and I've got
Pete Brown on the phone.

12
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.700
How are you, Pete? Good.
How are you, Scott? I'm

13
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:10.190
good. I'm good. I've installed
windows 8.1 on my surface

14
00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.990
RT and on one of
my laptops and I got

15
00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.590
to say it is 0.1
better. It really is. I

16
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.270
mean that sincerely, it makes
the RT usable. Yeah. I

17
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.640
mean, it's, it really does
help a lot there. I,

18
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.520
I think it's better than
0.1 better, but you and

19
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.690
I could debate that out
windows 8.7. Yeah. It's at

20
00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.230
least a 0.5 better or
whatever, but I like that

21
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.410
it's only 0.1. Cause it
gives us room for four

22
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.190
more points. There could be
a point too. Right, right,

23
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.010
right, right. But it's not
like a service pack, right.

24
00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.830
It's not like an SP
one. It's it's quite a

25
00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.890
bit more than that. Definitely.
I definitely agree with that.

26
00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.750
It's it's not just a
bunch of fixes and frankly,

27
00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.360
it's kinda like the way
the Mac operating system upgrades

28
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.180
are. They, they come out
and they say, you know,

29
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.170
snow tiger or whatever has
got a hundred new features,

30
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.800
you know? And I'm still
discovering little things, little features

31
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.580
in 8.1 little corners of
the operating system where stuff

32
00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.030
is new. What's a 0.1
of an animal. Like what's

33
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.890
a 0.1 of a tiger
or something like that. I

34
00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.350
don't know. I don't know.
Like there's a tiger then

35
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.050
there's a white tiger. So
snow leopard and snow leopard.

36
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:26.720
Right, right. Okay. So I
guess I could do different

37
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.240
colors. Well, it's, you know,
it's improved, right? Cause there's

38
00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.420
no level, it looks cooler.
Yeah. I mean, so like

39
00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.630
on, on windows eight one,
you know how we usually

40
00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.690
do multiple service packs and
stuff on the operating system.

41
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.670
But the like a lot
of people don't realize that

42
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.550
the service packs are done
by a different engineering team.

43
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.180
Right. I think they're like
sustained engineering or something, but

44
00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.970
this 8.1 is done by
all the same people who

45
00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.790
did eight. So it's, you
know, right from the core

46
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.310
operating system guys, which is
part of the point I

47
00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.470
wanted to make is that
it makes it a real

48
00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.000
next version of the system.
And I guess if we

49
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.160
just use names, nobody knew
people would just think of

50
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.110
it as the next name.
But so that's why I

51
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.970
think it is more than
just a 0.1 on there.

52
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.620
I see. So Fixes come
from the fixes group and

53
00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.600
features come from them. I
mean the main yeah, yeah,

54
00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.090
yeah. Okay. That's cool. I
noticed that this, there is,

55
00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.340
there is, I was going
to say the start buttons

56
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.890
back, but I wouldn't say
that a start button is

57
00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.620
back. Yup. Yeah. And when
you click on it, it

58
00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.040
goes to the start screen.
It does. And I don't

59
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.560
know if you've tried this
yet, but if you change

60
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.980
your start screens background to
be the same as your

61
00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.400
desktop wallpaper, like a lot
of that context switch that

62
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.520
everybody talked about. And that
honestly, I never thought was

63
00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.590
a big issue until I
saw the fix for it

64
00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.830
kind of goes away because
now it looks like something

65
00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.740
that's just overlaying your desktop
as opposed to, you know,

66
00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.910
bringing you out to a
different screen. So the start

67
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.610
menu pops up, but the
start screen, there I go

68
00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.300
again, there is no start
menu, Right? I mean, it's,

69
00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:01.920
it's not a start menu,
so we have the start

70
00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.250
screen, but then there's also
the, the magical windows X.

71
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.620
Right. I assume you, of
all people would probably know

72
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.950
about that one. So when,
when anyone is upset about

73
00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.880
windows before I tell them
to like, quit, just push

74
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.120
windows X And tell me
if you're, you know, you're

75
00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.150
still ready to quit. Right.
I mean, so we added

76
00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.090
the shutdown stuff there. So
it always had the, like

77
00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.370
the control panel and updates
and a bunch of other

78
00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.140
things there. But now at
least you can shut down

79
00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.340
there cause you know, the
windows eight, I think they

80
00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.740
assume that everybody would just
hit the power button on

81
00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.740
their computer. But I like
never really do that. Well,

82
00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.540
you know, I either close
the lid or on my

83
00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.600
desktop, I always shut down
from a menu. And so

84
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.880
that was buried. It was
like three or four clicks

85
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.380
to get to shut down.
So now that's quite a

86
00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.210
bit easier as well. Well,
a couple of other things

87
00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.300
added there, a mobility center,
which is what windows X

88
00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:56.160
To bring up is now
their PowerShell is in there

89
00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.510
too. Yep. Instead of which
is actually a change from

90
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.250
command prompt. I don't know
if that's a pretty subtle

91
00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.310
one, but someone, some people
might care, command prompt used

92
00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.920
to show up there now
PowerShell shows up there. Yeah.

93
00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:09.450
Which is still, you know,
you can still run some

94
00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.550
of the command part and
then also network connection. So

95
00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.760
it's really the power users.
Yeah. And so I think

96
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.840
that's between that and the
overlay of the start page

97
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.810
over a, or start screen
over your desktop background. I

98
00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.880
think that really helps a
lot with the context switching,

99
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.190
not everybody's going to like
it, you know, cause it

100
00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:27.870
is a change from what
we have before, but I

101
00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.210
think it makes a big
difference. Wait, you glossed over

102
00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.180
that one a little bit,
having the background of the

103
00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.050
start menu be the same
as your Wallpaper. Yeah. So

104
00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.680
this is what I was
mentioning before, where that really

105
00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.230
gets rid of that context,
which where I've got this

106
00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:46.590
kind of Spacey wallpaper background
that spans my, my two

107
00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.010
screens here and I have
my start screen set up

108
00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.100
so that it uses that
same background. So when I

109
00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:57.120
hit the windows key and
swap between those it overlays

110
00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.080
desktop background, it like, it
goes out a little bit

111
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.470
and overlays it with the
normal start screen tiles. And

112
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.800
so it doesn't give me
that jarring context switch that

113
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.080
so many people have talked
about with windows eight. Yeah.

114
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:11.800
That makes a huge difference.
I'll tell you this and

115
00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.110
you know, tell, go tell
the bosses or whoever you

116
00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:18.790
can tell everyone, everyone, 100%
of people that I have

117
00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:21.250
showed that feature to have
said that they wished that

118
00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:24.520
was the default. Yeah. So
I am really crossing my

119
00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.040
fingers that this be, this
is the default for when

120
00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:29.050
this ships cause I mean,
even I show it to

121
00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:32.740
my wife and she's like,
Oh, like literally it was

122
00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:36.100
a moment that they people
think that, that, you know,

123
00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:39.010
pushing the start button on
the keyboard or the start

124
00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:41.950
button on the screen launches
you into this entirely new

125
00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:45.580
universe. Right. And that simple
thing of changing the color

126
00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:49.480
to their background wallpaper makes
everyone go, Oh, okay. The

127
00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.480
buttons are bigger and they
feel the screen. So it

128
00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.060
ties them together, you know,
quite a bit better. Right?

129
00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:58.870
Yes. Please tell the buses.
Yeah. There's some other stuff

130
00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:01.780
like, like I just sort
of stumbled across this one

131
00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:04.300
day where you've you still
have the 30 inch screens,

132
00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.600
right? Yeah. I've got a
30 and two 24. So

133
00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:10.120
if you, if you mouse
into the corner to, to

134
00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.860
pull up the charms bar,
instead of using the hot

135
00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:15.550
key, the charms now show
up closer to where the

136
00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:18.160
corner where you most into.
Right. Right. Actually. Yeah. So

137
00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.750
I've got two machines in
front of me. One's eight

138
00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:23.500
one's eight one on the
eight Oh one. The charms

139
00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:25.540
are always centered vertically, which
means I got to go

140
00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:27.880
to the corner and then
go way up like seven

141
00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:32.080
inches, 10 inches away. Yeah.
Which actually, cause when you

142
00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.600
think about how you move
a mouse, it's not a

143
00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.450
straight line. It's almost always
an elliptical motion when you

144
00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:39.910
move a mouse. So you
would get halfway up there

145
00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:42.070
and it would dismiss the
charms bar or something like

146
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:44.500
that because you would get
out of the area. Right.

147
00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:46.690
So this just makes that
I think a lot more

148
00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:49.000
usable as well. And I
stumbled across that and I

149
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.190
was like, Oh, well duh,
of course that's how I

150
00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:53.560
would want it to work.
Right. Yeah, Yeah. Right. Little

151
00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.920
refinements like that. Yeah. And
I think those all, and

152
00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:58.600
when you add those to
the idea that you can

153
00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:01.690
now boot directly to the
desktop, if you want, which

154
00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:05.020
is another big thing for
a lot of especially developers

155
00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:07.960
and power users, I think
all those things together really

156
00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:12.490
help smooth, you know, the
transition into this, The one

157
00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:14.260
on the booting to the
desktop is a little hard

158
00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.000
to find. You have to
right. Click on the task

159
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.050
bar and hit. Yeah. Yeah.
I mean, I don't think

160
00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:22.030
we would want everybody and
their brother to do that.

161
00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:24.340
It's one of those things
that if you, if you

162
00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:26.020
know, it's going to make
sense for you, then do

163
00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:30.280
it. But I mean, ultimately
you want app developers to

164
00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.530
be able to have their
apps visible to people when

165
00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:35.380
they turn on the machine.
Right. I mean, as an

166
00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:37.990
app developer, you want people
to use your apps. And

167
00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:40.720
if everybody booted to the
desktop, nobody would see those

168
00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.340
apps. Right. So it would
make it much harder for

169
00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:45.420
people to make money developing
those. So I think that,

170
00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:47.110
you know, the boot to
the desktop thing is just

171
00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:48.760
for the people who know
that that's going to make

172
00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:51.520
them more efficient, but the
default is always going right

173
00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:56.280
to the start screen. Okay.
That makes sense. The other

174
00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:57.960
thing that this started screening,
I'm not, I'm kind of

175
00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.850
up and down about this
is that the search is

176
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:03.360
different. So when you hit
the windows key and start

177
00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:07.260
typing and then hit enter,
it searches everything. And by

178
00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.270
everything, it searches the internet
and it's, or just your

179
00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:13.880
phone, Peter. Right? So the
there's a good session on

180
00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:16.880
build about why search was
changed to be this way.

181
00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:19.790
But for the most part,
it just, it was a

182
00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:23.750
lesson learned from windows eight
where folks just found search

183
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:26.570
to be non discoverable, right.
Having it over there in

184
00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:29.240
the charms bar when search
was considered such an essential

185
00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:32.600
function was just really difficult
for most people to figure

186
00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:36.710
out. And so on the
start screen, and this is,

187
00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:38.690
this is to me just
a little bit confusing, just

188
00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:41.030
like what you're talking about
when on the start screen,

189
00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:42.800
when you do search through
the charms bar, you get

190
00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.860
that sort of global search.
But if you go down

191
00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:48.650
to the all apps, which
is, you know, either swipe

192
00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:51.080
up on a touch screen
or a hover over and

193
00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.630
click the little down arrow
on the bottom, left on

194
00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:55.760
a, on a mouse space
system, there is, if I

195
00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:58.700
remember correctly in, in page
search there that is searching

196
00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:03.740
just your apps, right? And
so this is consistent with

197
00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:06.950
how all the other windows
apps work, where we've, we've

198
00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:09.830
backed off from the idea
that all your search must

199
00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:12.440
be in the charms bar.
And instead said, you know,

200
00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:15.710
what's better for the users
is to have search on

201
00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:19.490
the apps canvas and then
have this other global search,

202
00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:22.140
which is now, now brings
you to that kind of

203
00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.800
Bing search, which has the,
you know, the hero pages

204
00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.590
for big searches. And, you
know, I really it's, it's

205
00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:29.930
quite an interesting search experience
for that, but it's not

206
00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:32.870
searching, you know, just like
your apps or just inside

207
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:36.200
a particular app. Okay. But
one of the things that

208
00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.630
I'm not able to find
now though, is how to

209
00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:42.170
search within an app. Like
if I'm in Netflix and

210
00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:45.650
I go to search, I
want to search Netflix. Yeah.

211
00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:47.900
It's searching the universe and
I'm not interested in searching

212
00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:51.110
the universe. So I think
for eight one, a lot

213
00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:53.360
of developers are going to
go back and put the

214
00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:56.330
search bars are, or, you
know, the search boxes in

215
00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:58.730
their apps. And Netflix would
probably be one of those.

216
00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:01.940
And, and quite honestly, so
we have this process called

217
00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:05.330
AFT at fast track, which
does reviews of apps. Right.

218
00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:08.600
And part of that review,
like we always had customers

219
00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.190
that came to us and
said, I want search on

220
00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:13.550
the screen. But the AFT
review said, no, thou shalt

221
00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:16.070
not have search on the
screen because that's not part

222
00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:18.470
of the standard. So most
of these people wanted to

223
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:21.220
do it that way, but
just, it wasn't something that,

224
00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:25.010
that fit the windows eight
design style. And so for

225
00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:26.210
them to be able to
go back and do it

226
00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:27.770
now, I think there'll be
like, ah, finally, this is

227
00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:30.950
what we want. Okay. So
it's okay to do that

228
00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:33.860
now. Like it seems like
with design guidelines, there's all

229
00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:36.080
these, there's all these rules.
Some of them are spoken.

230
00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:38.690
Some of them are unspoken.
It's okay to have search

231
00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:41.960
boxes. Now It's actually encouraged
to have search boxes now.

232
00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:43.760
And there are a number
of other, I spoke a

233
00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.410
little bit about this at
build. I mean, there are

234
00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:48.470
a number of other things
that we've changed. And quite

235
00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:51.320
honestly, we relaxed on where
I, a lot of it

236
00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:54.130
is. If you're an app
developer, you have an established

237
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:56.350
brand, you know, don't let
us get in the way

238
00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:58.450
of you bringing your brand
forward. I mean, needed to

239
00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:00.340
do what's right for the
users and do what's right

240
00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:02.740
for your brand. And then
all the rest of it

241
00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:06.340
is just kind of making
sure that you generally fit

242
00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:10.660
windows. Like, like we also
encourage now having all of

243
00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:14.920
the necessary commands for your
app on the canvas, as

244
00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:18.400
opposed to hidden in an
app bar. Right. So if

245
00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:20.890
you're, if you're doing something
on the screen where you're

246
00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:23.290
going to always want to
say, like, think about the

247
00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:25.000
mail client, you're going to
want to send an email

248
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.800
or something. Right. It'd be
kind of dumb to have

249
00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.170
to flick up on the
app bar and then hit

250
00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:31.240
send to do that. I
mean, so the send button

251
00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:35.340
is directly on the case,
Hide stuff. That's totally essential,

252
00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:38.250
important stuff to keep around.
Yeah. So we've updated a

253
00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:40.620
lot of that and it's
all just based on how

254
00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:44.070
people were using a windows
and then feedback that we

255
00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:46.770
got from all the different
partners. Right. So I think

256
00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:49.470
it's, you might look at
it as sort of backpedaling

257
00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:52.290
a bit, but I'm really
happy that, that we went

258
00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:54.180
and did that because you
could sort of stick to

259
00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:57.630
like kind of a crappy
approach or you can adjust

260
00:12:57.630 --> 00:12:59.400
it and do what people
are really asking you to

261
00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:02.250
do and, and make everything
better. Yeah. Yeah. If back

262
00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:04.860
peddling is making a better,
I don't care backpedal all

263
00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:08.880
you want. Yeah. Partly I'm
concerned. Most people think of

264
00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:12.870
it as being tablet focused.
I'm starting, I'm starting now

265
00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:14.880
after having used windows eight
for some months to get

266
00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:17.400
used to switching back and
forth. And when, when to

267
00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:18.930
do things in the desktop
and one things to do

268
00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:20.550
in video and full screen,
like I was on the

269
00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:26.520
plane yesterday and because the
8.1 preview includes outlook on

270
00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:30.270
my, on my RT, on
my surface RT, which really

271
00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:33.780
I didn't use before. Yeah,
no, it has outlook. I

272
00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:35.250
use it more often. And
when I was ended up

273
00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:38.430
doing was, I was, I
had half the screen, a

274
00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:41.730
movie and the other half
was out. Yep. And it's

275
00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:43.770
funny, it reminds me of
these window managers that I

276
00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:46.110
used in kind of the
Linux world where you didn't

277
00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:50.340
think about resizing windows, they
just resize themselves. Like I'm

278
00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:52.980
looking at my screen right
now. I'm in desktop. I've

279
00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:56.670
got you in Skype, desktop,
the task manager, I've got

280
00:13:56.670 --> 00:14:01.200
a browser, I've got outlook.
I've got an agenda about

281
00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:03.720
what we're going to talk
about today, but I'm having

282
00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:06.330
to move around and manage
all of those. I wonder

283
00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:08.880
if windows is moving towards
a world where there's less

284
00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:13.140
window resizing. Well, if so
guys like you and me

285
00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:16.200
on the desktop, I think,
you know, especially with multiple

286
00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:18.450
screens here and stuff are
still going to do better

287
00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:22.050
with individual windows that you
can change, not just their

288
00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:26.070
horizontal size, but their vertical
size and, and stuff. So

289
00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:28.770
I still rely on that
a lot, but you've been

290
00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:33.180
tech support for relatives before.
Right. You know, most relatives

291
00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:36.480
like run apps, full screen
all the time on their

292
00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:40.350
desktop. Yeah. That's true actually.
And if it's not visible,

293
00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:43.380
they assume it's not there.
Like my dad used to

294
00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:47.190
open new instances of like
word every single time that

295
00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:48.720
he wanted to get to
it. Cause he didn't realize

296
00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:51.410
it was down in the
task bar. Right. It's like

297
00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:53.780
one of those kind of
strange things. So if you

298
00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:57.590
think, you know, for the
average person using a computer,

299
00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:59.600
they don't want to do
window management. They just want

300
00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.880
to work in their app.
Right. And then when you

301
00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:04.790
combine that with the idea
that window management with touch,

302
00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:07.460
I mean, I assume you've
tried to use a touch

303
00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:10.220
screen with regular, like window
management before I'd like to

304
00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:15.440
resize windows and stuff. Now
it's not exactly friendly. I,

305
00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:16.580
you know, it's a, it's
a bit of a pain

306
00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:20.030
in the butt. So having
this simplified version where it's

307
00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:24.230
multiple side-by-side window panes, I
think makes much more sense

308
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:27.230
for both of those use
cases. So where I've specifically

309
00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:30.140
have used it, which I
think is great on, on

310
00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:31.970
something like the tablet is
when you open a link

311
00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:34.490
from your email client and
then it just, you know,

312
00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:36.590
makes a screen half the
size and then opens up

313
00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:38.660
by you over on the
right with the link loaded

314
00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:40.730
in it. And so I
think that was much better

315
00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:43.910
than the approach we had
before with the 320 pixel

316
00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:47.150
wide snapped view. And then
you had the rest of

317
00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:49.600
the screen and those are
the only two options. Hmm.

318
00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.990
Yeah. I, I'm starting to
realize that there are, there

319
00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:55.030
are certain things, I don't
think windows 8.1 kind of

320
00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:58.270
nails it, but it's, it's
close in the idea that,

321
00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:01.000
you know, sometimes I just
want to see this and

322
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.980
then I want the screen
to split. And then when

323
00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:04.060
I close it, I want
it to go back the

324
00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:07.570
way it was. And that
doesn't require me. Right. Clicking,

325
00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:10.960
opening a new windows, resizing,
et cetera, et cetera. You

326
00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:13.300
know what I mean? Yeah.
Yeah. And again, for power

327
00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:16.390
users and folks like us,
right. I, you still have

328
00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:18.550
all the normal window management
stuff that you can do.

329
00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:20.920
And on my desktop, that's
just how I run all

330
00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:23.530
the time. And then on
my laptop, I go half

331
00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:25.480
and half. Sometimes I do
one. Sometimes I do the

332
00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:30.880
other, I've got three monitors.
And one of the things

333
00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:33.070
that used to suck about
windows eight was that I

334
00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:36.640
would put a full screen,
something like Hulu or Netflix

335
00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:39.610
over on one monitor and
then I'd be doing some

336
00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:43.960
other stuff. And then I,
I like bump the start

337
00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:45.520
button or I'd go and
launch something and then it

338
00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:50.530
would disappear. Yeah. Yeah. That
totally sucks. Yeah. So I

339
00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:53.140
mean, you can have the
apps on different screens. If

340
00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:55.570
I remember correctly here, I
haven't done it here lately

341
00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:58.300
on this, but you can
have the apps on different

342
00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:00.580
screens. Right. And you can
also have the task bar

343
00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:03.370
properly span, both screens if
you have desktop going across

344
00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:06.490
the whole way. But I
think probably the most important

345
00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:09.070
thing of all that is
are both of your screens

346
00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:11.290
the same make and model
or all three of your

347
00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:15.220
screens, Dell, but they're two
years apart. Right. But they

348
00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:19.210
probably all have the same
DPI now I think so.

349
00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:23.170
Yeah. Like same resolution and
same size roughly. Yeah. Ballpark.

350
00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:26.800
Sure. Right. So, but that's
not always the case. Like

351
00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:28.990
some people will have a
big, main screen and then

352
00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:32.230
they'll have like a 27
inch screen on the other

353
00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:35.080
side. But that 27 inch
screen will be only 1920

354
00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:38.140
by 10 80 or something.
So it has different DPI

355
00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:41.500
from the main screen that
the person's working in. And

356
00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:43.720
so now in, in eight
one you have per screen

357
00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:47.890
DPI settings where the windows
can be aware that the

358
00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:51.030
DPI for each different display
that you have is different

359
00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:53.760
and can adjust the size
of the content on there

360
00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:57.540
appropriately where before it was
a, you know, one DPI

361
00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:59.970
across everything. And for those
of us who talk a

362
00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:03.570
lot, like you go and
present at an event. And

363
00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:06.720
if you're on something like
a surface pro, which has,

364
00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:09.990
is going to run at
like one 25 or one

365
00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:12.840
50%, whatever that number is
because you're not going, gonna

366
00:18:12.850 --> 00:18:15.270
use a surface pro at
1920 by 10 80 natively

367
00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:17.820
because everything on it is
super tiny. But when you

368
00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:21.270
project that stuff to a
screen, you probably do want

369
00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:24.390
it to use the full
1920 by 10 80 and

370
00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:26.850
use every pixel of that
and not be scaled. So

371
00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:28.920
now those are two different
screens. You can have separate

372
00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:32.600
DPIs. Does that work as
you move a window between

373
00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:35.030
two screens? Like does, if
I w if it's, if

374
00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:37.910
it's straddling half and half
Yep. What happens? So that's

375
00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:41.780
a little funky, actually, the
minute that the, that the

376
00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:44.870
window goes more than halfway
onto one of the screens,

377
00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:49.100
it scales it using that
DPI setting. So you'll see

378
00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:50.960
this like weird thing we
use, you pull it halfway

379
00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.390
across the screen, and then
the minute you get over

380
00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:55.280
that, you'll see it either
bump up or bump down

381
00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:57.770
in size and then move
over. So it's kind of

382
00:18:57.770 --> 00:18:59.810
a funky effect, but once
you realize what's happening, it

383
00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:02.510
makes perfect sense. Interesting saying,
Hey, I'm going to have

384
00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:03.920
to get an extra monitor
to try that out. I

385
00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:06.650
don't know. That's a good
question. I do have my

386
00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:11.360
Lenovo carbon touch that has
a, a docking station. Yeah.

387
00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:14.300
I bet you that. Yeah.
That'll actually work. Yeah. Laptops

388
00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:16.700
are a perfect case for
this where they're almost always

389
00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:19.820
a higher DPI on the
screen versus whatever external display

390
00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:22.370
you might hook up to
it. I'm actually plugging that

391
00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:24.170
in right now. I'm gonna
find out what this looks

392
00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:29.000
like. This is good information.
Okay. That's cool. Now I've

393
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:34.010
got a Fitbit flex on
my wrist. It's Bluetooth for

394
00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:37.850
it's like super low power.
And I knew that Bluetooth

395
00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:39.920
four was low power, but
I didn't know that there's

396
00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:42.320
some features about it. Like
You don't really have to

397
00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:46.430
pair with it. Yeah, Yeah,
no, it just knows that

398
00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:49.190
you care and you want
a pair. Yeah. I know.

399
00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:51.260
I don't get super deep
into that, but I do

400
00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:54.500
know that it's much easier
to, you know, pair things

401
00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:57.260
like 10 years ago or
whenever it was, it seems

402
00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:59.630
like 10 years ago when
Bluetooth stuff first came out,

403
00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:02.960
I'm sure you remember. It
was like pairing something was

404
00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:06.740
always agonizing. Like you would
spend 10 minutes trying to

405
00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:08.660
pair just like a headset
to your phone or something

406
00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:10.520
like that. And they realize
you look kind of dumb

407
00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:14.690
with the headset anyway, but
it was always like this

408
00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:17.450
agonizing thing. So I know
Bluetooth four has features to

409
00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:20.540
make that easier, but then
also has with the low

410
00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:25.100
energy profile that gives you,
you know, better, better energy

411
00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:28.280
usage and how it throttles
the signals going across and

412
00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:29.990
how you can pair with
more than one thing. So

413
00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:32.870
there's a lot of stuff
there and what's really kind

414
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:34.970
of cool about that is
that's all built into the

415
00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:38.270
API APIs for eight one.
So there is a wind

416
00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:42.530
RT, Bluetooth API, which you,
you went over and visited

417
00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:46.010
Chris at build, right. He
had his agent, Chris Walker

418
00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:49.510
from secret labs. I'm actually
speaking with him at a

419
00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:53.890
monkey space actually, by the
time this is published, we

420
00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:56.430
will have talked to had
our talk. Excellent. All right.

421
00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:58.830
So he had his agent
smartwatch on there, which if

422
00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:01.370
people aren't familiar with it,
it's very cool. It runs.net

423
00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:05.160
microphone work. It has Bluetooth
built into it and stuff.

424
00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:08.700
And he had a demo
of communicating to that watch

425
00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:12.090
from windows eight, one just
from a regular C-sharp and

426
00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:14.640
XAML app. Right. Which I
think is really great now

427
00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:17.430
that we, we can use
Bluetooth that way and communicate

428
00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:20.520
with these other devices just
from managed code or, or,

429
00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:22.950
or from HTML and JavaScript
or whatever you would like.

430
00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:26.220
Yeah. I've actually done some
work talking to USB stuff.

431
00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:29.520
I tried talking to a
USB serial port thing. If

432
00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:32.220
you're talking to us space
orb, I tried talking to

433
00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:35.760
blood sugar meters, and the
only game in town was

434
00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:39.900
this crappy library called USB
sharp. And it was so

435
00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:43.110
low level. I mean, it
was just like pulling teeth

436
00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:45.090
and it just made me
hate USB. Like if you're

437
00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:48.060
not doing USB code in
C plus, plus, then it's

438
00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:51.990
just over for you. Yeah.
And eight one also adds

439
00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:56.580
in USB APIs, but they're
so on the, the main

440
00:21:56.580 --> 00:22:00.270
USB API, it's when USB.
So it's important to know

441
00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:03.360
that that's not like there
are a lot of hobby

442
00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:05.850
things that use serial over
USB. Like they'll open up

443
00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:08.370
a virtual comm port on
your machine and, and stuff.

444
00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:10.470
And I always feel like
I've been thrown back 20

445
00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:13.050
years whenever I see something
crack open, like calms six

446
00:22:13.050 --> 00:22:15.840
on my machine. Right. So
it just, it just seems

447
00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:18.450
kind of nuts. So it's
not that kind of communication,

448
00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:22.170
but anything which can use
either when USB driver or

449
00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:24.480
show up as a human
interface device, you know, hid

450
00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:27.390
those APIs are also now
part of when our T

451
00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:32.730
okay. So People use the
serial port ones though, because

452
00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:37.740
there's nothing better. Is this
better as a real easy

453
00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:41.130
it's, it's super easy to
communicate over serial like doing

454
00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:44.760
when USB stuff requires a
little bit more work. And

455
00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:46.650
so, you know, the, the
product team's aware of this,

456
00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:48.480
and they're looking at it
to see what they'll do

457
00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:52.170
longterm. I think the fact
that, you know, cereal over

458
00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:56.490
USB is used so heavily,
especially in the, the, the

459
00:22:56.490 --> 00:22:59.310
hobby communities was somewhat surprising
to them because it seems

460
00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:02.100
like such an ancient technology
that nobody would use anymore.

461
00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:05.490
Yeah, exactly. This is cool.
So being able to plug

462
00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:07.890
hardware in is important to
me, like I mentioned, the

463
00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:10.650
blood sugar meters, we're always
trying to figure out ways

464
00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:14.100
to talk to these, these
USB APIs. The other thing

465
00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:17.550
that was cool at build
was next to Chris Walker

466
00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:21.150
from secret labs was a,
all the three D printers.

467
00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:24.540
People were going nuts, printing
out stuff. Yeah. Yeah. And

468
00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:27.870
they were everywhere. You know,
you couldn't, you, you literally

469
00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:30.390
could not walk around there
without bumping into a three

470
00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:33.690
D printer someplace. And the
main reason for that is

471
00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:37.110
we've added in three D
printer support to windows eight

472
00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:39.270
one. You want to like,
what does that mean? Cause

473
00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:41.850
if, if anybody who's familiar
with three D printing knows

474
00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:44.880
that the pipeline is usually,
you know, design a model,

475
00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:48.530
some sort of CAD software,
and then run it through

476
00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:51.440
like a slicing program, which
generates the different layers that

477
00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:53.660
are going to be printed
out. And then there's some

478
00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:56.870
sort of communication to a
printer and it's either a

479
00:23:56.870 --> 00:24:00.800
USB connection or save this
G code off to a,

480
00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:03.200
you know, a, a USB
key or something, and then

481
00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:05.630
go plug it directly into
the device or whatever. Right.

482
00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:09.170
So there's built in support
for three D printing. Now

483
00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:11.990
that's kind of, it's a
can actually, it's very highly

484
00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:16.640
related and part of the
regular printing API APIs so

485
00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:19.340
that somebody can use the
print charm. And if the

486
00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:22.460
app supports three D models
and stuff, they'll be able

487
00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:26.750
to just directly print to
these printers, which at first

488
00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:29.150
you might think, well for
hobbyist guys that doesn't, what's

489
00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:31.040
that getting them. And it's
probably not getting the hobby

490
00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:33.890
guys a whole lot yet.
All right. But what it's

491
00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:35.750
really doing is it's going
to make it so that

492
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:39.590
three D printers start becoming
much more consumer friendly and

493
00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:42.980
also quite a bit cheaper.
So you remember back in

494
00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:47.120
the day, regular printers, like
laser printers and stuff required

495
00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:50.280
a lot of onboards smarts
to print. Like they had

496
00:24:50.490 --> 00:24:52.520
all their own controllers and
they had, you know, their

497
00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:55.760
own CPS and everything inside
there. And then eventually we

498
00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:57.950
came up with this idea.
I think we call it,

499
00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:00.050
was it the wind wind
print or wind printer or

500
00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:03.740
something like that, where the
printers no longer had the

501
00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:06.830
logic on the printer. It
was using stuff inside the

502
00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:11.840
PC. And that was very
controversial at the time because

503
00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:14.210
people saw it as using
more resources on the PC,

504
00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:16.370
but it made it so
you can have like $30

505
00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:20.410
printers. Right. Because they just,
yeah. And so Remember waiting,

506
00:25:20.530 --> 00:25:25.990
you know, 15 minutes for
the, the printer's processor to

507
00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:28.690
like orient the page or
create the page and think

508
00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:30.670
about it. And we would
have times where you'd print

509
00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:33.910
six pages and one of
them would, would run out

510
00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:36.100
of memory. So then you'd
only get a few of

511
00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:39.550
the pages printed. Yeah. Yeah.
And, but what, so, and

512
00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:42.400
then once the, the, you
know, the OEMs and the,

513
00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:45.520
the hardware guys caught up
with what they actually needed

514
00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:47.110
to put in these printers
to make them work well,

515
00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:49.690
it, it became a non
issue, but so I, I

516
00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:52.150
can see us doing a
similar thing with three D

517
00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:56.830
printing where right now the
cheapest consumer friendly three D

518
00:25:56.830 --> 00:26:01.030
printer is, is like $1,300.
Right. And that's, you can

519
00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:05.230
get that at staples. There's
a, what's called Cubify three

520
00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:07.960
D printer. And it's made
to be very, very consumer

521
00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:10.780
friendly now, for those that
want to build them themselves

522
00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:12.790
and everything, you can do
it for three, $400. Right.

523
00:26:13.210 --> 00:26:18.070
But the being able to
have these consumer facing printers

524
00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:21.310
and these consumer ready printers
drop in price because they're

525
00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:23.050
selling more of them. And
because they have to have

526
00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:25.840
less logic inside is going
to make three D printing,

527
00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:28.900
much more reasonable for us
to do, to like say,

528
00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:31.540
buy three D printers. So
our kids can create action

529
00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:34.420
figures and stuff. Right. And
do their crafts. Like if

530
00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:37.210
you need to build a
DNA model for, you know,

531
00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:39.670
for your science class, when
you're in middle school, you

532
00:26:39.670 --> 00:26:41.710
don't have to go to
the craft store and buy,

533
00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:45.120
you know, 30, 30 foam
balls to do it. You

534
00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:47.730
can print out a, you
know, you can design the

535
00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:49.680
model in 3d and print
out that three D model

536
00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:54.470
directly there. Yeah. Somebody said
that the number one market

537
00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:57.410
for three D printers is
replacing battery doors on stuff

538
00:26:57.410 --> 00:27:00.230
where battery doors have fallen
off. I look forward to

539
00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:02.990
someone making a website that
has nothing for nothing but

540
00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:05.870
me typing in what I've
lost, the battery door four,

541
00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:09.320
and then three D printing
thing to let me print

542
00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:12.380
that battery door out. Sure.
And people make all sorts

543
00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:15.560
of replacements or broken parts
and stuff like that. And

544
00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:17.780
it's, it's one of those
things where it's just starting,

545
00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:20.980
you know, the big question
right now, everybody says, well,

546
00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:23.450
what would I use that
for? And if you remember,

547
00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:25.400
people used to ask the
same things about computers, it's

548
00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:27.770
like, well, what would I
use that computer for? You

549
00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:29.960
know, why do I need
a computer? It was a

550
00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:32.480
question at one point, right?
So it's going to be,

551
00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:34.430
I think the same thing
here where eventually it's just

552
00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:36.920
going to become an essential
piece of kit and people's

553
00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:39.950
houses. Now, I actually used
a three D printer in

554
00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:42.350
some of the work I
did for the keynote at

555
00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:45.650
build on day two. Nobody
can necessarily tell it was

556
00:27:45.650 --> 00:27:47.960
three D printed, but I'll
put together something about that

557
00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:51.830
maybe next week or something
like that. That explains where

558
00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:53.330
I use three D printing
just as part of my

559
00:27:53.330 --> 00:27:55.370
job. Yeah. I'd like to
be able to see it

560
00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:57.860
where you can't tell that
something is three D printed.

561
00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:00.230
Like I kind of, I
kind of broke the MakerBot

562
00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:01.550
guy a little bit where
I was like, well, this

563
00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:03.620
is cute. If I want
to make little figurines that

564
00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:06.590
are all red. Right. You
know, but then you go

565
00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:08.180
to look at some of
the other three D printers

566
00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:11.420
and they had some, like,
I think war hammer figurines,

567
00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:13.820
or some kind of gaming
figurines. And I could not

568
00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:16.640
tell without really looking clothes
that these were not, I

569
00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:19.430
don't know if they painted
them or they used multicolor

570
00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:23.360
techniques, but it's getting close.
So there are three main

571
00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:25.940
types or probably four, but
there are three main types

572
00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:29.480
of three D printers. The
consumer ones use this fused

573
00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:34.250
deposition approach, which is, they
basically spit out a stream

574
00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:37.730
of molten plastic and build
up a model from that.

575
00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:39.320
And that's the one where
you can usually see the

576
00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:41.810
layers. And that's where all
the consumer oriented ones are.

577
00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:44.300
They use a big, long
filament of plastic and they

578
00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:46.850
spit that out through a
hot nozzle. Right. But there's

579
00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:49.850
another kind, and these are
huge. They're like, you know,

580
00:28:49.910 --> 00:28:53.930
the size of Xerox copy
center type things, where they

581
00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:56.660
have a layer of powder
and then they use something

582
00:28:56.660 --> 00:28:59.120
that looks like an inkjet
that goes over it and

583
00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:02.300
sprays a colored fusing material,
some sort of an adhesive

584
00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:05.300
and builds it up layer
by layer that way. And

585
00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:07.010
what you get out of
that is a sort of,

586
00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:09.920
you still end up with
kind of a powdery texture.

587
00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:12.380
Like it's like, you can
tell it was built up

588
00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:15.140
from some sort of powder,
but you don't see individual

589
00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:17.930
layers and you can have
any number of different colors

590
00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:20.960
built into that. So that's
where some of those models

591
00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:23.360
that you saw, which looked
like there are multiple colors

592
00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:25.640
and they were huge and
lots of different parts. So

593
00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:27.410
that's another big one that
would be nice to see

594
00:29:27.410 --> 00:29:30.830
those become more consumer friendly,
but you know, you have

595
00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:33.920
to replace powder cartridges and
all sorts of things. So

596
00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:36.620
there's more going on there.
And then the third one

597
00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:40.400
is the liquid resin where
they use a laser to

598
00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:43.330
harden layers of liquid resin.
And that's the one where

599
00:29:43.330 --> 00:29:45.910
I've seen you get some
of the best results in

600
00:29:45.910 --> 00:29:50.890
terms of, of like fidelity
and resolution. But they're, they're,

601
00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:53.140
they're really tiny. And they
take a very long time

602
00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:55.450
and you have to have
a VAT of liquid resin,

603
00:29:55.810 --> 00:29:59.500
which that's not kid friendly.
Right. Well, I think it

604
00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:01.080
needs to get to the
point where it's like a

605
00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:03.540
laser printer. I don't want,
I mean, I think all

606
00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:06.720
of these things you're describing
are cool and interesting, but

607
00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:10.620
there's no way that it's
going to pop in. And

608
00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:12.810
Joe public is going to
buy one of these unless

609
00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:16.740
it's at staples and it's
a hundred bucks and the

610
00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:19.410
ink just works. Yeah. So
that first one that I

611
00:30:19.410 --> 00:30:22.170
mentioned, the cute, the Cubify
one is at staples, which

612
00:30:22.170 --> 00:30:24.960
is pretty cool. It's not
a hundred bucks, but what

613
00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:26.340
I do like is they've
made it so that the

614
00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:29.250
filament cartridges, you, you basically,
you plug them in, they

615
00:30:29.250 --> 00:30:31.410
have a little chip inside
them that knows what color

616
00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:34.140
it is and how much
filament is left. And it'll

617
00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:35.970
warn you if there's not
enough filament left or anything

618
00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:38.580
like that. So it does
really bridge that gap and

619
00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:41.190
make things much more consumer
friendly. That's cool. And then

620
00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:42.630
if I just plug it
in and I don't need

621
00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:46.680
any extra drivers and certainly
not multiple steps, like I

622
00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:49.290
want to plug it in,
have it figured the drivers

623
00:30:49.290 --> 00:30:51.600
out, get them from wherever
it needs to get them,

624
00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:57.420
and then download the model
of whatever I want, you

625
00:30:57.420 --> 00:31:01.290
know, the Lego man leg
or whatever, pay somebody 99 cents

626
00:31:02.130 --> 00:31:04.170
and then print it. And
it works. That's how it's

627
00:31:04.170 --> 00:31:06.480
going to work. I mean,
hobby guys, like to be

628
00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:08.490
able to tweak all the
settings to get the best

629
00:31:08.490 --> 00:31:11.310
possible print, but you know,
Joe consumer just wants to

630
00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:13.380
hit print and have a
model come out. So right.

631
00:31:13.530 --> 00:31:15.900
And, and I don't know,
I just actually on my

632
00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:18.840
inkjet printer, I've got an
HP all in one, I

633
00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:24.210
just said, align heads, right?
Like that's, that's the that's

634
00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:26.010
as far as I'm concerned,
that's how you tweak the

635
00:31:26.010 --> 00:31:28.410
thing you go and you
do a test print. I'll

636
00:31:28.410 --> 00:31:30.210
tell you which one went
better. I'm sure someone will

637
00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:33.600
make it. So it'll print
out three super Mario guys

638
00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:35.310
and I'll tell him which
one looks best. And then

639
00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:38.490
it'll know that that's the
one that's going to happen.

640
00:31:39.930 --> 00:31:42.600
Exactly. And for the hobby
folks that are listening on

641
00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:45.090
this. So, you know, understand
that this is completely optional.

642
00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:48.060
This is just to make
three D printing, more mainstream

643
00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:51.300
and more friendly for consumers.
And then everybody who does

644
00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:53.550
want to do that little
bit of tweaking or builds

645
00:31:53.550 --> 00:31:55.890
a rep wraps themselves. I
mean, you can continue to

646
00:31:55.890 --> 00:31:59.310
do that. No problems at
all. But I think the

647
00:31:59.310 --> 00:32:02.160
idea of having this in
a lot more consumers' hands

648
00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:05.610
will make it much more,
much more friendly. And then

649
00:32:05.610 --> 00:32:10.770
also just much. Yeah, definitely.
Cool. Okay. Well, when I'm,

650
00:32:11.010 --> 00:32:12.660
what am I going to
get this? I've got eight

651
00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:14.940
one preview. Am I going
to have to torch my

652
00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:18.090
machine to get the final
version on? No. As I

653
00:32:18.090 --> 00:32:20.820
understand that you will be
upgrade from a one preview

654
00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:23.850
to the final and then,
you know, everybody else will

655
00:32:23.850 --> 00:32:27.660
have it just as something
through the windows store. So

656
00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:31.200
when this becomes available to
the public at general availability,

657
00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:34.500
that which will be later
this year, they'll just go

658
00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:36.330
into the windows store and
they'll be able to upgrade

659
00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:39.980
or they'll see apps, which
say they require eight one

660
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:42.050
and they'll be prompted to
upgrade. And it's a free

661
00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:45.110
process it's done through the
store. There's no, you don't

662
00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:47.570
have to swap 30 floppies
to do it or anything

663
00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:51.080
like that. Right. It's it's
pretty painless. That's cool. Okay.

664
00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:52.730
So this sounds like you
said later this year, so

665
00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:55.460
that means before Christmas, I
will have this on my

666
00:32:55.490 --> 00:32:58.670
machine, in my wife's machine.
We'll just get a notification

667
00:32:58.670 --> 00:33:01.430
that it's here. Yeah. And
then if developers who want

668
00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:05.390
to play with it, now
it is available on, you

669
00:33:05.390 --> 00:33:06.380
know what? I don't have
the link you have to

670
00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:11.090
put in windows.com. Thank you.
Yes. Thank you. What that,

671
00:33:11.090 --> 00:33:13.730
does it install something on
your machine? Like an MSI,

672
00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:16.790
which then after you reboot
makes it, so the store

673
00:33:16.790 --> 00:33:19.010
link for upgrading to windows
eight, one is now is

674
00:33:19.010 --> 00:33:20.960
available. So you are going
to go through the same

675
00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:22.880
general process that people are
at the end of the

676
00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:26.090
year. Very cool. Okay. That's
good. Yeah. I know that

677
00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:28.850
there's, there was some talk
about whether some machines get

678
00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:31.760
torched or not, but like
on the windows are on

679
00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:36.470
the surface RT. It wasn't
a big deal. I did

680
00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:39.290
lose my apps, but then
it brought them back down

681
00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:42.920
automatically from the, from the,
the store. So I didn't

682
00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:45.950
really lose anything. Yeah. So
it remembered which apps I

683
00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:49.310
had installed, but it didn't
have the apps themselves there.

684
00:33:49.310 --> 00:33:51.740
And, Oh, that's, that's another
thing. That's an innate one

685
00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:54.230
is really nice. Is apps
will auto update from the

686
00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:56.030
store like that. You don't
have to go into the

687
00:33:56.030 --> 00:33:58.160
store and manually say, I
want to update these five

688
00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:02.510
apps. Cause nobody, nobody did
that. So part of enabling

689
00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:04.790
that also makes it, so
when your apps come down

690
00:34:05.030 --> 00:34:08.360
from the upgrade, they just
automatically update. Sounds like as

691
00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:10.010
an app developer, make sure
you don't screw up. The

692
00:34:10.010 --> 00:34:13.160
update is going to be
very important of course. But

693
00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:15.500
then on the plus side,
your users will actually have

694
00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:19.790
the updates. Everyone's guaranteed to
get the updates. And then

695
00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:21.590
now let me, let me
do a plug here. So

696
00:34:22.670 --> 00:34:24.680
if you are interested in,
in coding for windows eight,

697
00:34:24.710 --> 00:34:26.000
I have a book. Of
course there are lots of

698
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.770
good books out there, but
I also have mine. If

699
00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:31.070
you go to Bitly slash
peak windows book, it'll show

700
00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:35.030
up there. That's remaining. Okay.
I'll put that Bitly slash

701
00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:37.280
Pete windows book in the
show notes as well. Thanks

702
00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:40.340
for talking to me. Cool.
Thanks, Scott. This has been

703
00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:42.830
another episode of Hanselminutes and
we'll see you again next

704
00:34:42.830 --> 00:34:43.130
week.
