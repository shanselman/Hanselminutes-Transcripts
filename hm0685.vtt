Hi, this is Scott Hanselman.

13
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.870
This is another episode of
Hansel minutes. And today I'm

14
00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.290
talking with ludas Montana. She's
a senior software engineer at

15
00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.380
RGA. How are you? Very
good. Nice to meet you.

16
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.220
Nice to chat with you.
You've got a great video

17
00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.540
on YouTube with that. You
spoke at Cascadia Fest in

18
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.420
my area here in 2016,
and you were talking about

19
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.040
how to organize your learning
process and you're a developer

20
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.200
and you do a lot
of work in CSS, and

21
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.870
it was interesting that you
said how to organize your

22
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.540
learning process in CSS. So
you kind of thought about

23
00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.970
how one thinks and how
one learns and then you

24
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.400
applied it to CSS. Yeah,
for me, I was always

25
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.130
a very interesting, the modified
CSS or any other technology

26
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.970
that I usually focus on
on CSS. How's the learning

27
00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.720
process because you know that
the technology has a very

28
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.770
fast pace. It's like every
two, three months something new

29
00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.210
appear something and new technology
and new blog posts, and

30
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.330
you start feeling like you're
kind of behind of it.

31
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.460
And you're like, Oh, I
want to be up today.

32
00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.360
They want you to be
like the cool kid who

33
00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:13.760
ride the tidy, clean CSS
and using the latest technologies

34
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.930
and all the time there
things appearing and you've started

35
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.370
feeling quite behind. And it's
like a talk that I

36
00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.670
gave back as Katie in
2016. What's about how I

37
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.730
dealt with anxiety and the
pressure of the fast pace

38
00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.730
of the tech industry. It
was more about talking about

39
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.450
my feelings during my learning
process. They absent downs because

40
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.480
usually when you get a,
a blog post or you

41
00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.840
see a talk or a
new technology, everything is great.

42
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.300
Everything is perfect, but that
takes a lot of work.

43
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.300
So I had the need
to talk about my journey

44
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.080
about that because it's like
a, I think that is

45
00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.790
a, like a, it happens
to everyone that is, has

46
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.850
apps on their phones. We
only learn from our failures.

47
00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.650
Yeah. And I appreciate that
you call that out, that

48
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.340
we can't learn everything. Right.
We can't know everything everything's

49
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.040
moving so fast, but why
do you think that we

50
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.860
tell ourselves that we can,
why are we convinced? You

51
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.260
know, we see someone speaking
at a conference when we

52
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.860
say, Oh, they know everything.
Oh, I'm I suck. I'll

53
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.920
never know everything. And we
get all sad about that.

54
00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.110
We get all depressed about
it. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. There

55
00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.230
is a constant pressure of
learn new things and keep

56
00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.540
all up to date with
the latest stuff, like new

57
00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.230
frameworks, new platforms, new ideas
on how to write code

58
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.830
in the moment. It was
less than a, if you

59
00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.970
just name them or I
TCSs, for example, what's better

60
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.900
even Tufts or spaces where
on the plate, everything was

61
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.570
just calming. Keep coming out
and whatever, a new thing

62
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.960
you got better as <inaudible>
a new one came up

63
00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.580
and you got to go,
Oh, okay. And back to

64
00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.520
a square Sierra again. And
that's really a lot of

65
00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.520
pressure to learn your things,
just spend all your time

66
00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.240
coding to be this super
developer. And not at least

67
00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.310
in my, in my case,
it led to a lot

68
00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.630
of anxiety. And so one
day I was like, okay,

69
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.840
this is, I'm really not
enjoying this. So, but I,

70
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.960
something that I really loved
doing, so how will I

71
00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.080
organize this? So I can
keep kind of up to

72
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.890
date, but at the same
time, knowing that I cannot

73
00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:17.940
know the hundred percent of
the things, but at the

74
00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.120
same time, enjoy my job,
which is actually what I

75
00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.050
love doing so many times
that happens. The, I was

76
00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.520
feeling mentally tired and hitting
the wall, learning. We're learning

77
00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.920
some friends. And I start
saying, Oh, this is not

78
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.470
for me. I now look
at this person who did

79
00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.410
this new thing. I never
really good at that, blah,

80
00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.930
blah, blah. And all that
internal dialogue that we all

81
00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.100
have, that it's about understanding
the learning tool called it's

82
00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.710
a process that never ends.
It's not a static. And

83
00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.760
it changes. I mutate every
few months. So yeah, it's

84
00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.700
a, it was very interesting
to me to start learning

85
00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.120
that. And since then, I
started to feel more, at

86
00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.520
least organized with a little
bit more of peace of

87
00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.760
mind. It's, it's interesting that
we, we seem to think

88
00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.070
that we would get our
degree or we learn our,

89
00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.900
you know, we learn our
technology and we think it's

90
00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.150
going to stay that way.
And it simply doesn't, I,

91
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.050
I think only the basics
of stained have stayed the

92
00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.450
same, but all the technologies
that I used to work

93
00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:18.570
on when I started in
school are all dead. Except

94
00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.800
maybe C Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's a, yeah. It's a

95
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.910
huge process. And then you,
yeah, you finished school and

96
00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:28.860
you're like, Oh, okay, I'm
ready for the real world.

97
00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.550
Then you realize that you're
not, and you have to

98
00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.280
keep learning. And this is
something that I love about

99
00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.490
this profession that you need
to keep learning all the

100
00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.790
time, but at the same
time handle the pressure. Yeah.

101
00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.130
Yeah. And I also appreciate
that you called out that,

102
00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.830
I thought this was supposed
to be fun. And then

103
00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.440
you get into something and
you're like, I'm not enjoying

104
00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.860
myself anymore. And I don't
want to quit tech because

105
00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.500
of anxiety of having to
try to learn everything. Right.

106
00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:01.970
So you're applying very formal
learning processes. You're basically attacking

107
00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:06.020
the problem with lists and
organization. You said in your

108
00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.050
talk, I'm going on an
adventure. Like there's a formality

109
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.740
to the way that you
put this together. Yeah. It's

110
00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:15.400
a, I mean, I have
a, what I like to

111
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.430
call a positive and when
I start a new project

112
00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:20.530
and when they come and
me to do something new,

113
00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:24.580
that is like, it's like
the panic of the wide

114
00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:26.950
bar that you're like, Oh,
what I'm going to add,

115
00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:29.440
adding here, whether you able
to do it with a

116
00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.800
one, maybe I'm not going
to able to do it.

117
00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:36.730
But I always end up
trusting myself, like comparing with

118
00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:39.760
previous situations. And I was
always able to do it

119
00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:43.180
and learning which more effort,
less effort. But it was

120
00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.760
always like that. It's like
during the course of your

121
00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:49.210
life, we all have fears,
fear of being rejected, fear

122
00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:52.120
of being criticized, fear of
not knowing something that is

123
00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:55.870
obvious to everyone else. It
happens a lot. The, someone

124
00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:58.180
is explaining something to you
and they say, Oh, this

125
00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:02.050
is super easy. Yeah. Maybe
for that person is super

126
00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:04.120
easy. But if for me,
it's not, isn't going to

127
00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:07.330
say, Oh, I know that
good. So what's wrong with

128
00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:11.350
me? And for me, I
try to organize site. Okay.

129
00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:14.470
No one is like, we
are a start from scratch

130
00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:18.280
and we'll help each other.
So let's try to be

131
00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.220
patient. I know that it's
true that sometimes you have

132
00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:24.040
a deadline and you really
need to keep up to

133
00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:27.520
that. But it's good to
start organizing. For example, when

134
00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.530
I have a big problem
that I don't know how

135
00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:32.230
to solve, I start to
divide the problem in very

136
00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:35.590
small tasks. So I can't
focus on each one, but

137
00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:37.930
at the same time taking
into account the whole group

138
00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:41.110
of things. Hmm. I really
like that term that you

139
00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:45.370
just, I've never heard that
positive anxiety. That's a really

140
00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:47.020
interesting way to think about
it because I think we

141
00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:51.040
all think of anxiety as
being a deeply horrible thing.

142
00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.590
You know, nobody wants to
have anxiety, but there is

143
00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:57.790
a positive effect of stress
because it's making you aware.

144
00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:01.000
It's preparing you for the
future for, you know, something's

145
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.480
about to happen. And I
can either take that stress

146
00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:07.330
and it can make me
small and make me hide,

147
00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:10.750
or it can prepare me
for action. So you're saying

148
00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:13.870
you are anxious, you acknowledge
that you're anxious and then

149
00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:16.300
you decide to take action.
And you are you saying

150
00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:19.180
that you take the energy
of the anxiety and move

151
00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:22.120
it, it moves you forward?
Yes. It keeps me going.

152
00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.010
I mean, it's not the
only thing that keeps me

153
00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:27.610
going, but it's like, their
thing is the carrots that

154
00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:29.860
I have in front of
me say, okay, I need

155
00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:32.290
to get moving because if
not, I'm going to, it's

156
00:08:32.290 --> 00:08:35.050
going to be more complicated.
So, and at the same

157
00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:38.530
time, I say, well, it's
a new opportunity to learn

158
00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:45.280
something new. It's a positive
anxiety slash excitement. That something

159
00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:47.860
that is unknown when I
get to learn something now

160
00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:51.340
it's, yeah, it happens to
me that sometimes I go

161
00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:54.520
pass in through the, the
success phase and then go

162
00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:57.120
to the fence where you,
and that is when you

163
00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.600
start learning something and everything
goes smoothly. And at some

164
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.970
point you feel like you're
not improving that there is

165
00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:05.190
a task that you cannot
resolve and it takes you

166
00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:08.220
more time that you think
you should be taking you.

167
00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:11.610
And that's when we start
feeling frustrating question your career

168
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:14.610
and everything. And that's when
you start dealing with those

169
00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:18.030
insecurities in the beginning for
me, was something very hard

170
00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:20.610
to overcome. I felt that
I knew so little that

171
00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:23.670
I knew that it was
difficult, but at the same

172
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:27.450
time, I wasn't start to
stop enjoying programming. And that

173
00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:29.910
was not good. So, but
I knew that it was

174
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.660
an effort that was worth
doing. So I kept going,

175
00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:36.540
I took a deep breath
and I, one day I

176
00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:39.180
started to say, okay, let's
see what works for me.

177
00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:42.270
Well, because I mean, what
it works for you maybe

178
00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:45.720
does not for me and
vice-versa, but I started to

179
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:49.800
look for a mythology that
helped me. The first one

180
00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:52.410
that I found was to,
yeah. To understand that it's

181
00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:55.650
something that you don't learn
over the night, that it

182
00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:59.040
is a process that it
takes time. So I started

183
00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:02.700
talking to people, I started
to be open like, Hey,

184
00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:05.490
sometimes I have no idea
what I'm doing. How do

185
00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:07.950
you do this? How I,
what do you think about

186
00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:11.970
this that I enjoy doing?
And start feeling more open

187
00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:14.970
about that? Like, Hey, sometimes
I don't know. And a

188
00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:17.640
lot of people were like,
yeah, that happens to me

189
00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:20.790
too. And that's fine. Yeah.
It's a, it's like, I

190
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:24.660
started to understand the it's
a, there is a big

191
00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:27.420
game of things, security sometimes
in his profession. And I

192
00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:29.970
assume that in many professionals
they are chill, but it's

193
00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:34.050
like the, the superhero developer
at the end of the

194
00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:36.360
day, we are all people
and we are all learning

195
00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:39.480
and trying to do our
best. And it was really

196
00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:42.000
good for me to start
talking with people because very

197
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.550
soon I call notice that
I was feeling was much

198
00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:47.010
more common that I saw
a lot of people were

199
00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:51.120
having the same feelings. So
it's like, it's not your

200
00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:55.740
fault. It's not just you.
Programming is hard. So, yeah.

201
00:10:55.830 --> 00:11:00.450
And it's good to start
having fun, being bothered, learning,

202
00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:04.200
like looking at stuff that
I did a month or

203
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:06.810
a few years ago and
say, Oh, well, I have

204
00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:10.260
improved. And that's a, that's
not really a good thing.

205
00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:14.100
It's like, we don't only
learn from success. We also

206
00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:16.860
learned from failure. I learn
a lot from failure. I

207
00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:19.050
have to say. So it's
a, isn't a good thing.

208
00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:22.100
I often say that we
should fail fast and fail

209
00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:24.680
often. And if you fail
very, very fast and you're

210
00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:28.010
doing a great job. Yes,
yes. One of the things

211
00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:30.170
I also liked about your
talk was that you said

212
00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:34.070
that you started to respect
your own learning pace. And

213
00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:37.490
I really liked that rather
than beating yourself up about

214
00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:41.480
not learning fast, you are
learning about yourself and you're

215
00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:45.350
understanding how you learn and
how fast you learn and

216
00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:49.340
actually formally respecting the pace
at which you learn. And

217
00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:52.700
then using that pace to
set yourself up and prepare

218
00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:54.610
your lists of how you're
gonna, how you're going to

219
00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:58.800
learn. Exactly. Yes. I remember
a few years ago when

220
00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:01.440
I started coding, I was
like, no, I need to

221
00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:03.900
do a fast, if I
do a fast, it means

222
00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:07.590
that I'm good. And then
they seen the reducing that

223
00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:12.720
first Pacey canes with years
of work experience. Yeah. I

224
00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:15.630
guess a life experience. When
you get older, you are,

225
00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:19.140
you have, sometimes you become
more patient with many things.

226
00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:23.190
So yeah, it's like, I
started to notice the been

227
00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:27.780
going so fast in, in
learning one, wasn't helping me

228
00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:32.070
to learn properly until it
was being hard from, for

229
00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:35.430
myself, for my, for my
mood, for my health, because

230
00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:39.780
sometimes I was staying late
at night and then waking

231
00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:42.150
up early to go toward
the next day with all

232
00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:45.510
the stress of having a
pending task. And I started

233
00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:48.540
to say, okay, this is
my learning pace. I'm going

234
00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:51.660
to respect that. Of course
at the same time, trying

235
00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:54.450
to, to do everything that
I need to do. But

236
00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:58.080
when it's about learning new
things, I try to respect

237
00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:02.430
and getting to know myself
a bit more. Yeah. Being

238
00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:04.740
able to know yourself and
what your, not just what

239
00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:07.020
your limitations are, but what
the things you're good at

240
00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:10.140
are can set yourself up
for success. Like I know

241
00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:12.570
what time of day I
need to learn. I know

242
00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:14.400
when I'm a good learner
when I'm not, I know

243
00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:16.620
when to walk away, that
was a huge thing for

244
00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:20.100
me. Cause I think we
are taught as programmers that

245
00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:23.460
we should work late into
the night. And you know,

246
00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:26.040
you should be somewhere at
12 hours or 16 hours

247
00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:28.890
of straight coding. There's a
moment that will happen. And

248
00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:31.950
no, there isn't. Sometimes you
just have to say, okay,

249
00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:34.920
it's three in the afternoon
and I just cannot work

250
00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:37.470
anymore. I'm going to go
for a walk because I'm

251
00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:41.430
done. Yes, yes, absolutely. Yeah.
For example, I know that

252
00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:44.420
in the evening and at
night I can't it's, it's

253
00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:48.210
like my brain does not
work well. My most productive

254
00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:52.050
time is the morning and
early afternoon. So I usually

255
00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:55.500
organize my days to do
the most difficult tasks in

256
00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:58.350
the morning and the beginning
of the afternoon, and then

257
00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:01.800
leave all the stuff that
is already know how to

258
00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:05.610
do that. Maybe it's repetitive
or that I already it's

259
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:08.610
easier to do to too
late in the day. Yeah.

260
00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:13.080
That really organizes me a
lot. It's a, yeah, it's

261
00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:17.880
a really good to remember
to look back from time

262
00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:20.640
to time and see what
you have done and how

263
00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:23.940
to organize your work and
see, okay. All these things

264
00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:27.660
I have done them better
in the morning. Maybe the

265
00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:30.810
evening is not a good
time for me, but yeah,

266
00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:33.060
it's a, it's a really
good thing that I learned

267
00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:34.830
how to do. And I,
I feel proud of that,

268
00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:37.110
honestly. No, I think you
should feel proud of that

269
00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:40.320
because it's an interesting thing
that I, my wife has

270
00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:43.890
said before that she feels
sometimes that people let their

271
00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:49.260
lives happen by default. So
if you don't decide, if

272
00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.280
you don't take control, then
it will just happen and

273
00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:54.920
whatever happens, happens. And then
you say, Oh, that happened.

274
00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:59.060
But it happened by default.
If I simply do tasks,

275
00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:02.630
whenever I'm not going to
necessarily have as good of

276
00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:04.910
an experience. But if I
sit down and say, what

277
00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:07.160
am I good at? When
should I do my expense

278
00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.950
reports? When should I do
the hardest coding? And like,

279
00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:13.670
it's like, like you said,
formerly know when my time

280
00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:16.880
is when my what's it
called when you get into

281
00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:21.080
the groove, you know, and
then schedule everything that way

282
00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:23.510
formally. I don't think we
sit down and think about

283
00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:26.180
that. I think we go
to work, we check email

284
00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:28.580
and then life happens and
our day happens and then

285
00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:31.400
we blink and then it's
dinner time. And then we

286
00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:35.020
do it again the next
day. Yeah. And that's, I

287
00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:39.130
don't know if that's good.
I mean, we need to

288
00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:42.580
do it. Yes. There is
a part that is real

289
00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:45.940
the yeah. Or pay the
bills. That's true. But at

290
00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:49.720
the same time, we need
to have, find time to

291
00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:53.560
have hand, for example, for
me to start to find

292
00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:57.280
some side projects or a
theme that I am interested

293
00:15:57.310 --> 00:16:01.560
in and called do a
little demos for myself in

294
00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:05.050
inculpating what I can learn.
Something new that I know

295
00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:08.350
that I don't have a
deadline, but I, I can

296
00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:11.350
take my time and enjoy
that much more. Another thing

297
00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:14.770
that I do a lot
is to read about new

298
00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:19.060
topics when I'm commuting to
work the time that I

299
00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:22.330
have for myself to, to
do that. So that's always

300
00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:26.650
a really good, Yeah. And
some people like the side

301
00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:30.940
projects myself, I mean, that
is energizing and other people,

302
00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:33.220
they code all day. And
the last thing that they

303
00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:35.920
want to do is code
later. So for them it's

304
00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:40.060
disconnecting completely. Yes. I have
periods of time that I'm

305
00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:43.090
like that. I have to
admit that I'm much more

306
00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:46.210
like that I'm having side
projects all the time. It's

307
00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:48.760
a, there is something the,
yeah, you need to have

308
00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:52.030
side projects, work on open
source and all that. And

309
00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:56.080
it's perfectly amazing. Yeah. But
it's also good to say,

310
00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:58.570
well, I, ain't going to
be honest with myself now.

311
00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:01.000
I not feeling like doing
it. So I'm going to

312
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.630
take a few weeks for
myself to us. It's also

313
00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:08.470
good to recharge for me.
It's not about stopping feeling

314
00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:11.560
lazy. It's more about taking
some time to recharge. So

315
00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:15.400
then you can be better.
Your code is powerful. And

316
00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.830
so are you. And when
you consider the reach of

317
00:17:17.830 --> 00:17:20.620
your code, it's clear that
to deliver quality code, you

318
00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:23.950
must also deliver secure code.
So where can you start?

319
00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:27.820
A first step is educating
yourself on basic secure coding

320
00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:30.880
principles and beginning to put
these principles into practice every

321
00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:35.020
day. Vera code secure coding
toolkit is your go to

322
00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:38.920
resource for all your secure
coding needs. The benefits of

323
00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:43.780
the toolkit include learning best
practices for secure coding, understanding

324
00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:46.900
how to secure your dev
ops environments and learning to

325
00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:51.840
combat the most common software,
stay secure and download this

326
00:17:51.840 --> 00:18:01.920
valuable asset today at vericode.com/toolkit.
That's V R a code.com/toolkit.

327
00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:05.490
And another thing that you
do to recharge is do

328
00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:09.060
community work. You, you organize
conferences and you get people

329
00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:11.250
together so that they can
learn as well. And does

330
00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:14.270
that help you recharge? Yes,
a lot. I mean, it

331
00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:18.440
was in 2016. I organized,
we ever Farida. I know

332
00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:21.140
that you have her talking
here on the podcast a

333
00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:26.540
few weeks ago and she
explained the whole 2018 edition.

334
00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:31.160
When we organized the first
one, the 2016, it was

335
00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:35.090
completely new. For example, for
me, I had never even

336
00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:38.810
organized a huge party. And
then I wasn't organize it,

337
00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:42.980
that 300 people conference. So
yeah, it was quite a

338
00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:48.320
lot. Yeah, we have, yeah.
The economy in Argentina fluctuates

339
00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:52.730
a lot. So it was
quite hard to get sponsors,

340
00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:57.050
to pay for flights, accommodation
for speakers, but it was

341
00:18:57.050 --> 00:18:58.910
so good. And the main
thing that we wanted to

342
00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:02.480
do was to have a
really low price because here,

343
00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:04.970
I know that conferences here
in the U S are

344
00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:08.600
usually 500 bucks or maybe
more, maybe a bit less,

345
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:12.650
but we really wanted from
day one, whatever we say,

346
00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:15.080
we want to keep it
under a hundred dollars because

347
00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:17.360
I know that that's the,
most of people may be

348
00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:21.290
able to pay here. So
we not only kept the

349
00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:24.290
ticket very low, that also
led to try to get

350
00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:27.440
all the money from sponsors.
But also we wanted to

351
00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:31.820
give scholarships to two people
who are in secondary school.

352
00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:34.850
That means between 16 and
18 years old school, we're

353
00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:37.970
interested in programming. We want
to give them a giveaway,

354
00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.730
TIG free tickets for them.
And there was some icing

355
00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:43.340
because you can see a
lot of kids, like we're

356
00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:49.370
just starting really early, too
cold, seeing their idols speaking

357
00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:52.160
on stage. And there were
amazing. And for me, it

358
00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:55.160
was also a really a
really good thing. Because for

359
00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:59.630
example, I started writing CSS
because of Harry Roberts CSS with

360
00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:03.020
our try, if you now,
him and I, he was,

361
00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:06.800
I remember when I started
coding in CSS, I was,

362
00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:10.070
I was watching a, his
video, some talks and blog

363
00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:13.310
posts. I was like, wow.
I would really like to

364
00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:17.750
go to a conference and
see this guy speaking on

365
00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:20.840
stage. So, well, I call
no go to England or

366
00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:23.420
any other country. So he
organized my own conference and

367
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:27.320
invited him to speak. That's
pretty cool. So you go

368
00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:30.800
from someone who you idolize
in the space to working

369
00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:33.980
with them? Yes. Yes. It
was something that I really

370
00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:36.890
could experience, but yeah, the,
I think that the best

371
00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:40.700
part of the organizing CSS
column for Argentina was to

372
00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:44.240
give the space to everyone
to learn. In my opinion

373
00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:47.330
is like we are, for
example, I didn't go to

374
00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:50.230
university to learn how to
call. I'm actually, I got

375
00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:53.410
a degree in graphic design
and web design, but not

376
00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:56.680
like computer science. So everything
that I have learned is

377
00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:00.910
because someone took the time
to teach me something, to

378
00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:04.720
explain something to me and
listen, that's something really valuable.

379
00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:08.820
And I really wanted to
give back that. One of

380
00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:10.800
the other things that you
said is that you use

381
00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:13.920
chaos as an opportunity to
learn something new. It sounds

382
00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:18.270
like organizing a conference in
a difficult economy when you've

383
00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:20.340
never heard. I love that
you've never organized a party.

384
00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:24.330
It sounds like an opportunity
that you could either panic

385
00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:26.550
and not do it. Or
you could turn that positive

386
00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:29.670
anxiety into something successful. Do
you do the same thing

387
00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:33.540
when you find a chaotic
code base? Yes, absolutely. I

388
00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:38.250
try to, to organize, for
example, usually work on very

389
00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:43.290
long term and large scale
projects. Usually it's a really

390
00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:45.270
big challenge for me, but
I gotta say that it's

391
00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:49.380
one of my favorites. I
love thinking steps ahead when

392
00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:51.060
it comes to work. And
when you work on a

393
00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:54.930
large scale projects, especially in
longterm ones, you really need

394
00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:58.530
to think ahead. So yeah,
that gives sometimes some anxiety

395
00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:01.350
in terms of, Oh, how's
it going to be? How

396
00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:04.500
much it's going to change.
But I'd like to, after

397
00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:07.590
a few years of experience
on this, I say, okay,

398
00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:10.170
I know that things change.
I know that what you

399
00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:12.150
have in the beginning, it's
not going to be that.

400
00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:15.360
So it's like, I start
thinking a few steps ahead.

401
00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:19.320
It's like a, I kind
of war with a single,

402
00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:22.620
without when my mind on
a single feature. I try

403
00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:26.550
to think everything as a
group. And from there start

404
00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:30.540
asking, looking at the bigger
picture on our ski myself

405
00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:34.050
questions. Like how much is
it going to change if

406
00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:36.780
it's going to be, for
example, a localized project or

407
00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:40.140
not. Because for example, we
know that that you should

408
00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:43.290
have, they give you the
design, Oh, everything in English

409
00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:45.930
and that you need to
localize it to German or

410
00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:49.950
Finnish, which are really long
languages, all of the same

411
00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:54.660
break. So for me, it's
about organizing all that thinking

412
00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:57.930
a few steps ahead. Yeah.
It happens to me that

413
00:22:57.930 --> 00:23:00.690
I, I have lost count
how many times I started

414
00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:05.460
writing a new CSS for
a project. And then I

415
00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:08.610
wasn't repeating to myself like,
like a, some sort of

416
00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:11.940
mantra. Yeah. This tiny will
be really tidy. I will

417
00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:15.510
revise CSS, CSS, like the
cool kids do. Of course.

418
00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:18.600
And especially, this is my
favorite one of course, I'm

419
00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:21.690
going to notice when my
code base gets messy. Yeah.

420
00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:25.770
Duh, but I know you
don't. So what it's trying

421
00:23:25.770 --> 00:23:29.880
to start doing is really
pay attention to that when

422
00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:32.520
things start to get messy.
And what I do for

423
00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:35.730
that is, yeah, it usually
happens two things. One is

424
00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:38.580
how much the project can
change in an unexpected way.

425
00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:42.390
That means the client decided
to take a different direction,

426
00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:45.200
you know, the sundae direction.
And with that, we can

427
00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:48.590
think of your steps ahead.
And then it regarding code

428
00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:51.140
based on that, we can
think of how we can

429
00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:55.370
maintain that. So usually every
time that I start a

430
00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:58.580
new project, I learned, I
always like to start thinking

431
00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:01.280
of the elements he has,
then it will go for

432
00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:04.100
the layout. Then it will
look for how it will

433
00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:08.510
look on different platforms, mobile
devices, tablets, et cetera, et

434
00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:11.690
cetera. And they start asking
myself questions like, how is

435
00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:15.260
the topography, the font size,
the font family, the use,

436
00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:19.400
how is the layout a
hosted color palette? Because if

437
00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:23.060
I start thinking from that,
from the very beginning, I

438
00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:27.250
can start organizing my CSS,
my files. It's like, ah,

439
00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:29.120
okay, all the part of
layout is going to be

440
00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:31.760
here. All the powder from
Tyson is going to be

441
00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:35.300
there. It's like a, I,
I go from that channel

442
00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:38.480
aspect of the whole project
to a particular one. I

443
00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:41.750
think that for me, organizing
our messy code base is

444
00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:44.690
about, yeah. Taking a look
at the whole picture, but

445
00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:46.820
at the same time, be
really aware of all the

446
00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:49.940
small parts of it. So
you can put them altogether

447
00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:55.540
and have something as tidy
as I wonder sometimes why

448
00:24:55.570 --> 00:24:58.600
I'm, I feel like I'm
a good backend developer and

449
00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:01.120
I can organize things in
functions and break things down

450
00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:05.620
like you've described. But inevitably
my CSS ends up being

451
00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:09.130
pretty when it starts and
then chaos at the end,

452
00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:13.570
you know, it, it just
falls apart. Do you think

453
00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:16.960
that people are not considering
CSS and their front ends

454
00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:19.900
like in a formal way?
Should I be breaking things

455
00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:24.130
up into functions more in
smaller pieces? Yes. I actually,

456
00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:26.620
I started to have a,
since I started using SAS

457
00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:29.200
a few years ago, I
started to have a more

458
00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:35.530
programmatic approach on CSS, like
the building components doing functions.

459
00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:37.780
And that actually helped me
a lot to learn more

460
00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:42.730
JavaScript. So yeah, I think
that many people consider CSS

461
00:25:42.730 --> 00:25:45.730
like, ah, well is what
it gives the, the color

462
00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:48.880
and the style of the
phone, some modules. And that

463
00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:53.650
said, but the thing is
that it's easy to write,

464
00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:57.190
but hard to maintain later.
So it's good that you,

465
00:25:57.250 --> 00:25:59.530
you're also organized and put
a lot of thoughts on

466
00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:02.290
that because it's also an
important part of the, of

467
00:26:02.290 --> 00:26:05.740
the website. If you siloed,
you start a project and

468
00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:09.580
you have a really nice
class that does a lot

469
00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:12.130
of things and it's super
usable. And then your project

470
00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:16.660
starts changing. That class is
not that great anymore. And

471
00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:20.920
you start overriding and adding
more calls. We all know

472
00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:23.530
that when we write a
line of CSS, we are

473
00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:26.410
like, Oh no, let's not
touch that one. Let's not

474
00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:29.770
remove it. You, you never
know how, what other part

475
00:26:29.770 --> 00:26:32.800
of the website can affect.
So it's like, and that

476
00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:36.430
way we start adding more
and more content. Yeah. That's

477
00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:39.700
how it usually gets messy.
Yeah. I think sometimes that

478
00:26:39.730 --> 00:26:42.580
backend developers, as we start
moving ourselves into the front

479
00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:46.710
end, we, for lack of
a better term, we start

480
00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:49.740
to trivialize what we think
front end development is like,

481
00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:51.960
and then we, we make
a small change and we

482
00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:54.750
just make a small change
and we forget the cascading

483
00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:59.720
part of, of, of cascading
style sheets. And we, we,

484
00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:01.980
we think that it's just
a little bit of markup

485
00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:05.310
here and there, but it's
an entire programming language with

486
00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:08.340
formal functions and like SAS
maps and things like that.

487
00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:11.490
And I think that I,
as a backend developer make,

488
00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:13.950
I assume it's simpler than
it is. And I end

489
00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:16.740
up hurting myself and I
create chaos rather than remove

490
00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:20.540
chaos. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. I
think that happens to me

491
00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:23.060
too. I'm not a backend
developer, but a, that also

492
00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:27.860
happens to me. But yeah,
I think the CSS is

493
00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:32.120
a little bit underestimated sometimes.
Yeah, that happens a lot.

494
00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:36.680
But yeah, it gives you
a quick lesson very fast

495
00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:38.960
because it gets really messy
and where you need to

496
00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:41.990
touch something of that code
base again, you're like, Oh

497
00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:45.230
no, what have I done?
So yeah, I have been

498
00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:47.450
to a lot for me.
I try to be very

499
00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:51.380
mindful of the naming convention,
Sunday file structure that I

500
00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:54.980
used, because I really helps
me to know where every

501
00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:57.890
style leaves. It happens many
times. I don't want to

502
00:27:57.890 --> 00:28:01.190
simplify styles because we are
afraid of changing a style

503
00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:03.590
that it could be used
somewhere else, but we don't

504
00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:06.080
know where, and there just
in case we don't touch

505
00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:08.900
it and we keep adding
more specificity to their styles.

506
00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:11.870
And that also comes from
used to have a messy

507
00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:15.200
code base. So yeah, many
times what I do is

508
00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:20.180
to start dividing. There is
an approach called functional CSS

509
00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:23.720
that is doing small classes
that do one thing and

510
00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:27.020
they do it well. For
example, we have a text,

511
00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:30.170
for example, naming that we,
sometimes we can create a

512
00:28:30.170 --> 00:28:34.040
class at is text blue.
But yeah, what happens if

513
00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:37.760
tomorrow the client or the
designers decide to change that

514
00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:41.030
text to read the class
won't be usable anymore. But

515
00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:43.070
in the case that that
class is only applying eye

516
00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:46.700
color, you just replace the
class for another one. We

517
00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:51.200
done that better naming maybe.
And that can also help

518
00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:54.740
it's about those small things
about being mindful. I think

519
00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:57.440
that if we stop a
little bit and every time

520
00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:02.270
that we write CSS, we
write it for thinking steps

521
00:29:02.270 --> 00:29:05.000
ahead. Thinking if it's going
to be easier to maintain

522
00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.580
of is going to be
a problem in the future

523
00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:10.700
or not. Instead of just
writing for the sake of

524
00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:14.540
our in color layout, to
the components of the page,

525
00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:17.720
it will help a lot
to have a cleaner code

526
00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:21.230
base. Yeah. I'll, I'll be
sure to add information about

527
00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:24.260
functional CSS to the show
notes. There's some really interesting

528
00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:28.310
things because when I learned
CSS first, we started with

529
00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:31.370
inline styles and then we
moved it all into an

530
00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:34.340
external style sheet. And then
we made a bunch of

531
00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:38.630
little utility classes like, you
know, bootstrap. And we would,

532
00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:42.100
you'd say dev class, and
then you'd have <inaudible> and

533
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:44.530
all this information. And then
people said, no, it should

534
00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:47.890
be like object oriented. You
should have like a style

535
00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:53.200
called dot user or dot
flight. And people are basically

536
00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:55.300
going back and forth trying
to figure out what's the

537
00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:59.560
correct way to write CSS
that scales to really large

538
00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:01.360
sites. And I know that
you work on big sites

539
00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:04.890
and it can be really
challenging. Yes it is. Yeah.

540
00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:09.710
I do this discussion about
object oriented CSS or ITC

541
00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:14.820
assess or using a bend
methodology. I honestly don't think

542
00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:17.370
that there's a right or
wrong way to do it.

543
00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:19.980
I think that the best
methodology that you can use

544
00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:22.500
is the one that suits
you and your project and

545
00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:26.580
every project has different needs.
So it's not a, well

546
00:30:26.610 --> 00:30:29.340
maybe what works for you
in one project, won't work

547
00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:32.820
for me on another one.
And it's good to, for

548
00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:35.340
me, the most important thing
is to have a talk

549
00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:38.070
with the rest of your
colleagues, if you're working on

550
00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:41.790
the team and also the
designers, the clients, the producers

551
00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:45.240
to have other understanding of
the project so we can

552
00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:48.180
see how we can scale.
And from that we can

553
00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:51.690
grade the other methodology on
CSS for this. Interesting. So

554
00:30:51.690 --> 00:30:54.990
you would, you would use
one methodology on one project

555
00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:58.230
and then an entirely different
one on another. Yes I

556
00:30:58.230 --> 00:31:01.340
have. Yeah. Okay. That's good
to know. It's it's, it's

557
00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:03.960
interesting. I perhaps I maybe
was a naive and I

558
00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:06.780
assume that one size fits
all. And then one day

559
00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:09.690
we would solve CSS and
we'd know that this is

560
00:31:09.690 --> 00:31:13.080
the right way for everything.
I mean, I have my

561
00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:17.010
preferences, my, if I need
to pick a preference, a

562
00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:21.270
skull and chewy, ITSs I
TCSs what I have many

563
00:31:21.330 --> 00:31:24.600
components angle for a very
general aspect to a very

564
00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:29.640
particular one. That will be
my, my main preferences. But

565
00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:34.200
I have worked on other
projects where Ben approached block

566
00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:38.240
element modifier was more suitable
for the project. So I

567
00:31:38.250 --> 00:31:42.180
decided to use that, maybe
it wasn't my favorite approach,

568
00:31:42.210 --> 00:31:44.310
but it was the one
that was working and he

569
00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:48.060
ended up working well. So
I T C S S

570
00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:54.090
is a managed CSS architecture
from CSS, CSS, wizardry, correct?

571
00:31:54.210 --> 00:31:56.160
Yes, exactly. And then what
was the other one? You

572
00:31:56.160 --> 00:32:01.320
said, bam, element, modifier block
element modifier. And I'm going

573
00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:02.760
to make sure that we've
got links to all of

574
00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:06.420
this for people to go
and explore. Oh, Mason. Fantastic.

575
00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:08.580
Well, it's been so nice
chatting with you today. I

576
00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:11.580
really appreciate your time. Yes.
Thank you for giving me

577
00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:14.010
the chance to talk here.
Really enjoy it. We've been

578
00:32:14.010 --> 00:32:17.070
chatting with ludas Montano and
this has been another episode

579
00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:39.510
of Hanselminutes and we'll see
you again. <inaudible>.
