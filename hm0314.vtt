<inaudible> From Hanselman it's dot
com. It's Hanselman. It's our

2
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.330
weekly discussion with web developer
and technologist Scott Hanselman. This

3
00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.680
is Lawrence Ryan announcing show number
three 15 recorded live Thursday,

4
00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:35.810
April 19th, 2012. Support for Hanselman mints
is provided by Tellerik online@teldrikdotcomandbyfranklins.net

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.830
training developers to work smarter
and now offering gesture pack

6
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.550
a powerful gesture, recording and
recognition system for Microsoft connect

7
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:50.120
for windows developers details@gesturepak.com. In
this episode of Hansel minutiae,

8
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:57.530
Scott talks with Richard Campbell, Scott
Hanselman. This is another episode

9
00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.530
of Hansel minutes. In fact,
another episode of Hansel minutia

10
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.470
with Richard Campbell. How are you?
Richard Campbell? I am well, my

11
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.680
friend. How are you? Lovely.
What's on your mind today.

12
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.740
Oh God. Tons of things
actually. Have you seen the,

13
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.440
the app place? Me place
me. Yeah. So place me

14
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.100
app.com. Okay. And what is
this on? What, what platform?

15
00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.570
This iPhone. Okay. Place me
app. Okay. Looking at it.

16
00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.220
So here's the story of
place? Me basically. It's turning

17
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.640
on all of the sensors
in your iPhone and recording

18
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.450
everything to compose a total
map of what you do,

19
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.090
where you go and roughly,
you know, what's going on

20
00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.690
with you all the time.
Okay. Now it's, it's private.

21
00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.060
It's keeping the data to
itself. It's not sharing it

22
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.210
with anyone, but imagine it's
four square, but you don't

23
00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.350
have to check in, right.
A lot of battery for

24
00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.800
me. Yeah. I imagine this
is a battery challenge, but

25
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.620
what I find interesting about
this is that this looks

26
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.300
like the manifestation of the
personal assistant, the way it

27
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.930
should be. You know, what's
the big problem I have

28
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.630
a Foursquare is that I
only, I get to announce

29
00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.940
to my friends when I
go somewhere as if they

30
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.510
would care. But if I
have this thing working all

31
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.030
the time, it knows, you
know, when I walked into

32
00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.460
the Walmart and when I
walked out based on the

33
00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.000
GPS data, okay. One of
the things that happens with

34
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.920
the way they compose the
data, it's fairly quickly, it

35
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.550
figures out where you live,
where you work, where you

36
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.260
usually get gas, where you
normally go to eat, like

37
00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.870
all of that stuff. If
your phone's on all the

38
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.210
time and sensing all that
information, it figures all that

39
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.910
stuff out, quite pretty natively,
which I think is kinda

40
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.930
cool. You know, just this
ability. And now you tie

41
00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.750
that in with say your
schedule, right? So you're in

42
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.160
a restaurant and this app
now knows you you're at

43
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.190
a restaurant. Your next meeting's
at two o'clock it's now

44
00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.660
one o'clock. It knows the,
because it knows the address

45
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.040
of where you need to
get to. It knows the

46
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.320
route you're likely to take.
And it also knows there's

47
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.150
an accident that way. So
it can warn you, you

48
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:08.470
need to leave early, cause
you need to go a

49
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.760
different route. Is it that,
I mean, it could do

50
00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.850
that, but is it that
sophisticated? I mean, first it's

51
00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.390
tracking me, which means I
need to trust it. I

52
00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.280
don't know where they're storing
it. Presumably it's in the

53
00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.080
cloud at some point I,
other than for an alibi,

54
00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.650
I'm not quite sure why
I need this. I like,

55
00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.300
you know what I keep
thinking of in the context

56
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.510
of a personal assistant, that
the big thing that happens

57
00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.250
when you have an assistant
for a while is that

58
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.530
they start to be able
to anticipate need, right? That's

59
00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.380
the bigger thing. Right. And
I keep hearing, we're going

60
00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.390
to have these personal agents
that are going out, finding

61
00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.550
us best prices for airfares
and you know, all of

62
00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.470
the stuff we need to
do, sort of making our

63
00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.350
life easy, but they don't
know enough about us to

64
00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.680
be able to be effective.
Do you really think that's

65
00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.040
the problem because I've had
Siri now for what is

66
00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.490
it? Six months. Yup. And
it's just a hot mess.

67
00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.890
It really is. I mean,
all I can get Siri

68
00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.430
to do effectively and regularly
is call people. Yeah. But

69
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.060
you know, Siri is, I
mean, I love my iPhone.

70
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.170
I'm a big iOS fan.
Everyone knows it, but it's

71
00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.350
embarrassing. Like Siri is just
like the Siri demo that

72
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.120
you do with your families
is just a consistent embarrassment.

73
00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.810
Like it's, I mean, I
seriously, I, it will not

74
00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.550
work when my wife is
looking at it. It just

75
00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.070
won't. But I still think
that's the metaphor of you

76
00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.490
giving instructions to a device.
Right? You demanding something. I

77
00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.490
like the idea of the
passive part of the anticipatory

78
00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.360
part. You know, you can
always ask to have your

79
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.480
water glass refilled at the
restaurant, but don't you like

80
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.220
it better when, before your
glass is empty, the guy

81
00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.850
comes by and tops it
up again. Sure, Sure. Until

82
00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.430
I leave and the water's
wasted, but that's just me.

83
00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.220
Yeah. Well, you're not alone
with that. I've seen a

84
00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.080
few people get anxious about
those things. I live in

85
00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.240
British Columbia where we're up
to our hip waders and

86
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:05.700
water, but that's what I'm
looking for in this agent

87
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:10.020
mentality is you're anticipating my
need, you know, what needs

88
00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.040
to happen next and can,
you know, catch potential problems

89
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.370
before they happen. That's what
I like about TripIt my

90
00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.100
favorite feature of TripIt pro
is that when I turn

91
00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.200
my phone back on, when
the foot, when the airplane's

92
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.940
at the gate, I get
a text message tells me

93
00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.180
over the next gate is
Yeah, that is nice. That

94
00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.000
is nice. But in that
case, they're charging you 50

95
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.520
bucks a year for it.
And that's the thing that's

96
00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.790
kept me off TripIt pro
Well, yeah, if you only

97
00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.670
have to get the jump
on a canceled or delayed

98
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:42.810
flight once before that $50
is so trivial. Yeah, Yeah,

99
00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.540
yeah. That's true. This, this,
this idea though, that an

100
00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:48.570
application is going to anticipate
my need. I feel like

101
00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:52.140
we've reached a bit of
a plateau in programming languages

102
00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:55.860
right now. And programming paradigms
where the average programmer has

103
00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:59.060
four loops and while loops
and if statements and switch

104
00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:03.050
statements in, at their, at
their Beck and call, but

105
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.170
they can't really move past
that. So when I hear

106
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:07.940
that there's going to be
intelligent agents that are able

107
00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.480
to like parse natural language
and anticipate and build decision

108
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.780
trees. And I'm thinking to
myself, I don't think most

109
00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:16.760
people know what that code
looks like. You know? I

110
00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.800
mean, that's one of the
things I think is making

111
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:22.100
connect a little bit difficult
to, to understand is that

112
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:25.970
for one class of programmer,
it's like, Hey, here's an

113
00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:29.600
amazing byte array that contains
depth data and you can

114
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.240
go off and play with
it. And for another class

115
00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.550
of programmer, they're like, okay,
I have a whole stream

116
00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:35.720
of ones and zeros and
I don't know what to

117
00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:40.600
do with it. Yeah. I
mean, and you're right. That

118
00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:42.820
tying it to natural language,
I think is not the

119
00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:46.840
big issue here. This idea
of passively anticipating need to

120
00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.030
me is the most interesting
idea. If as soon as

121
00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:51.400
I have to order it
to do anything we failed.

122
00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.000
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Alright. I
want you to take a

123
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.990
look at the composite of
my behavior and my upcoming

124
00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:04.210
requirements, probably primarily from my
schedule and make sure that

125
00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:06.640
path goes smoothly. I mean,
that's, when you talk about

126
00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:09.220
a physical, personal assistant, somebody
who actually is out to

127
00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:12.310
assist you, that's what they
do when they're doing their

128
00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:16.840
job. Well, they interact with
you. You rarely interact with

129
00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:20.380
them. Don't you think that
it is, it is privacy.

130
00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:22.840
That is the number one
thing that is going to

131
00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:26.740
hurt us in all of
these situations. I mean, my

132
00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:29.560
wife uploaded a photo on
Facebook last week and then

133
00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:31.930
a bunch of people that
she didn't know started commenting

134
00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:34.690
on it. And she thought
that she'd marked it as

135
00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:39.760
friends. Right. And she had
somebody and which means it

136
00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:43.660
included their friends. Exactly. And
that, that union, that Venn

137
00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:47.560
diagram was not something that
she had anticipated. And let

138
00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:48.940
me give you an example
here. I just, while you

139
00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:54.820
were talking, I downloaded placement.
Okay. And it says, Oh,

140
00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:56.170
what's your name? And you're
giving a name and a

141
00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:58.870
password and I'm thinking, okay,
cool. I'll give you my

142
00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:01.270
name and my password. But
the first thing I thought

143
00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:04.060
was, how do I know
they're not going to send

144
00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:07.660
me my password in clear
text? Yeah. You know, like,

145
00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:09.370
I don't know these guys
from Adam. I know them

146
00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:11.710
from you. Cause you said,
and if I go and

147
00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:14.230
say, cool, here's my password.
Welcome to place me. Here's

148
00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:17.170
your password, Fred. You know,
you're all my passwords, Fred,

149
00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:20.080
you know, it's like, I
don't know their privacy policy.

150
00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:23.350
I don't know their, if
they're legit, if they're legitimate,

151
00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:25.570
I don't know what they're
doing with this. And how

152
00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:28.000
are they gonna, what are
they going to do with

153
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.160
this information? You know, they're
going to track this stuff.

154
00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:32.950
They're going to, they're going
to sell my personal information.

155
00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:35.740
The question is that they're
going to sell it as

156
00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:38.650
labeled as Scott Hanselman, or
are they looking at it

157
00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:41.590
in the aggregate? And do
you care if they're looking

158
00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:43.750
into the aggregate? I don't
care if looking at the

159
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:45.370
aggregate, but that's the thing.
When you go to the

160
00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:47.770
hospital, they draw some blood
and they say, would you

161
00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:50.470
mind if we use your
blood for genetic testing? And

162
00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:52.510
you say, well, you know,
it's in the aggregate though,

163
00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:55.320
right? They just want to
know how general people are

164
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.530
my age and my race
and my type do, but

165
00:08:58.530 --> 00:08:59.880
I don't know if they're
not going to clone me.

166
00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:04.100
They always end up cloning
me in the movies. The

167
00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:07.100
pro my concern here is
we have always given up

168
00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:11.000
privacy to certain people like
your personal assistant. I mean,

169
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.820
let's face it. Then, you
know, you can be having

170
00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:15.800
an affair and your wife
doesn't know, but your personal

171
00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:20.270
system, bloody nose. True. So
the, as much as people

172
00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:22.190
tend to be fixated on
the privacy issue all the

173
00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:25.700
time, that's not the compelling
part. Right. The interesting part

174
00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:28.190
about here is when we
choose to give it privacy,

175
00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:32.630
can we get some real
benefit from it? Yeah. I

176
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:34.640
think we can, when we
choose to completely give up

177
00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:37.280
privacy, of course we can.
Well, I don't think you

178
00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.860
need to give it privacy.
I think the question here

179
00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:43.460
is the constant fixation on
it. Like, why are we

180
00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:46.310
throwing out the IRS? We'll
have a privacy concern. I

181
00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:48.650
think it can be addressed.
Why are we not going

182
00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:51.470
to do this? Because there's
a privacy concern. Well, aren't

183
00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:54.920
privacy concerns, primarily safety concerns.
I think that the privacy

184
00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:56.510
concerns kind of break down
to a couple of things.

185
00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.640
There are, I want to
be safe, meaning I don't

186
00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:01.190
want someone showing up at
my house for dinner. Yeah.

187
00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:03.350
I want my family and
children to be safe. But

188
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:07.190
then there's also the embarrassment.
People who really want things

189
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:09.320
to be private often have
something that they don't want

190
00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:14.390
anyone to know about. Yes.
But yeah, I'm getting really

191
00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:15.950
tired of the privacy of
eight. Cause it's the same

192
00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:18.920
thing over and over again.
It's like an irrational fear.

193
00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:22.040
I do the internet safety
talks for parents. So I've

194
00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:27.950
gone researching hard for a
case where a stalker has

195
00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:32.000
hunted down a child through
their Facebook profile and kidnap

196
00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:35.000
them. And I have not
been able to find any

197
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.800
actual instances of that. Someone
is going a bit of

198
00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:43.220
deductions, but they're all, that's
got nothing to do with

199
00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:48.890
public information on Facebook. Yeah.
I have to disagree on

200
00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:52.400
that. I mean, here we
go. I mean, I just

201
00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:56.450
found one just by Googling
for it. Right? Peter Chapman murdered

202
00:10:56.450 --> 00:11:00.110
a girl. He met on
Facebook Right now. Again, this

203
00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:02.780
is not specific to Facebook,
right? This is, and this

204
00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:05.300
is her communicating with him.
It was a bi-directional, there

205
00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:07.100
was a relationship. It could
have been done over the

206
00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:09.230
phone. It could have been
done in a mall. It

207
00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:11.690
could have done any number
of ways. This has nothing

208
00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:15.140
to do specific with the
massive privacy violation that is

209
00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:18.770
Facebook Chapman interacted with that
kid. That kid made a

210
00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:23.090
bad choice at some point.
Well, I mean, ultimately, if

211
00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:24.620
someone's going to get you,
they're going to get ya

212
00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:27.920
is what you're saying. Well,
but they, but the pub,

213
00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:32.720
you know, random people, don't
generally kidnapped random people. There

214
00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:42.290
is a connection between them.
Hmm. Okay. I still think

215
00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:46.130
it's important to be careful
And thoughtful and who you

216
00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:48.680
talk to and who you
share information with is, is

217
00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:54.070
a worthwhile discussion, but it
shouldn't be paralytic. I agree.

218
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:56.980
I mean, I'm dealing, I'm
talking to parents of teenagers

219
00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:59.830
who won't let their children
on Facebook at home and

220
00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:02.230
are asking me how to
keep them from going on

221
00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:08.340
Facebook at their friends. Yeah.
Did you see, did you

222
00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:11.610
see that my post on
the, the Voxer application and

223
00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:14.340
the privacy concerns I had
about that? No. Tell me

224
00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:17.010
about it. So I'm sitting
in New Zealand in a hotel

225
00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:20.460
and I'm working on my
talk for web stock. And

226
00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:24.090
I had installed at Rob
Connery's suggestion and application called

227
00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:28.290
Voxer V O X E
R. And it connects to

228
00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:30.300
your Facebook and it sees
who else, you know, who

229
00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:33.270
has a boxer and it's
a push to talk application,

230
00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:37.050
right? So it's not, it's
like delayed voicemail. You push

231
00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:38.700
a button, you talk, you
let go of the button.

232
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.850
So I was talking back
and forth with Rob and

233
00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:43.590
everything works fine. I put
the phone down and then

234
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:47.070
suddenly a random person that
I do not know, sends

235
00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:52.260
me a, a Voxer of
voicemail and it's happening in

236
00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.570
real time. So this, this
person is, they're doing this

237
00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:58.140
right now. Right? So I
listened to it and it's

238
00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:00.120
a child it's like an
11 year old or 12

239
00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:03.990
year old child. And there's
doing a sing song, kind

240
00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:07.500
of schoolyard. T's, they're going
Hanselman, who names their kid

241
00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:10.350
Hanselman. What's that about Hanselman?
I have to do it.

242
00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:15.030
And it just random childish
nonsense, but the child's full

243
00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:18.240
name is there. And I'm
thinking, who is this person?

244
00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:21.000
I don't know this person.
Is this someone, I mean,

245
00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:23.520
Fox or told me it
would only connect me to

246
00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:27.840
my friends. Right. But there's
a little red pin by

247
00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:31.650
it. And I click on
the pin and it's a

248
00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:34.650
public library in, you know,
on the East coast. And

249
00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:36.600
I show up here now
I suddenly, I have the

250
00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:39.450
full name of a person,
of, of a child in

251
00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:41.160
a public library. And I
know where they are. I

252
00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.830
could call the library and
talk to this child. I

253
00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:47.010
want to do. And they're
sitting there obviously using the

254
00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:50.610
free wifi at the library,
but I, so then I

255
00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:53.070
go and Google around for
it and find the child's

256
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:56.730
Google plus account. So now
we have an underage under

257
00:13:56.730 --> 00:14:03.090
13, a child who basically
is forgotten that information can

258
00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:07.800
leak or never taught turns
out. This is the, the

259
00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:13.320
son of a Facebook friend.
Who's a, like an acquaintance

260
00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:15.900
of mine, not a friend
in the hangout all the

261
00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:18.390
time way, but in the,
we are connected on Facebook.

262
00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:24.120
So Voxer has basically unbeknownst
to me, extended the people

263
00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:27.960
that it would show my
presence to, to the sum

264
00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:29.730
of all people who are
all my friends and their

265
00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:33.300
friends. So this kid thought
he was just getting a

266
00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:36.660
list of suggested people and
was just pranking them like

267
00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:39.570
a prank phone call, but
in the process leaked his

268
00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:42.890
name, his information, his location.
And then I, you know,

269
00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:47.220
I, one Google search, I
find this person's Google plus

270
00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.950
account. So anyway, I go
on Facebook and the dad

271
00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:54.140
has got his phone number
exposed. So I texted dad.

272
00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:56.600
I'm like, I think your
kid is on the East

273
00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:59.270
coast somewhere. And he explains
the whole situation to me

274
00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:01.310
and the kids going to
school over there, et cetera,

275
00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:04.040
et cetera. I write a
blog post about it. It

276
00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:06.860
takes about 10 minutes. He
texts the kid with the

277
00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:08.750
blog post and the kid
freaks out and he's like,

278
00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:12.710
Oh my goodness. I had
no idea I'm going to

279
00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:14.720
stop doing that right away.
But the point I'm making

280
00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:18.110
is that a should a
13 year old child be

281
00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:22.190
taught that they can leak
information. That's an interesting question

282
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:25.930
and be sure they care
Well. And I think generally

283
00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:29.050
you need awareness of your
own privacy and what you're

284
00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:32.950
spreading, where like, just that
ability to view yourself from

285
00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:36.520
the context of others is
sort of a fundamental thing

286
00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:41.740
of understanding your online persona.
That is deep. My friend,

287
00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:44.410
that is, that is what
no, that, that is, that's

288
00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:48.550
the difference between grown and
not grown. Be able to

289
00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:51.250
view yourself within the context
of others. And I know

290
00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:55.990
grown grown ass men, and
it cannot do that. I

291
00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:58.810
know people know, And I
think it's weird raising the

292
00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:03.070
generation of kids that have,
are going to be wrapped

293
00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:05.770
in a technology. That's going
to make that constantly available,

294
00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:08.290
this whole idea that you
have to own it on

295
00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:12.550
your online persona. And, and
it, I typically, you know,

296
00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:15.070
we talk about that age
line at 13 for Facebook

297
00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:18.010
and Google pluses. So forth
is at the time when

298
00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:22.180
a child is trying to
define their real persona, their

299
00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:26.410
persona persona in, in, in
front of people and are

300
00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:29.830
in the process of transitioning
from a peer group of

301
00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:34.210
parent to peer group of
peers. They also are demanded

302
00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:36.910
to do this online as
well. That would, that is

303
00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:39.490
so difficult. I mean, the
idea that you're, you're, you're

304
00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:42.490
developing who you are as
a person, and you're expected

305
00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:45.220
to maintain a personal brand.
And I remember bringing a

306
00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:48.820
personal branding years ago on
the internet and people thought

307
00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:51.130
it was very egotistical. Like,
why do you think you

308
00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:53.890
are, you have a personal
brand, but you know, anyone

309
00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:56.500
who's got more than 10
or 20 links on the

310
00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:58.900
web needs to be thinking
about I'm going to go

311
00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:01.630
and get this job at
Goldman Sachs. Here's a picture

312
00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:03.820
of me with a lampshade
on my head. I have

313
00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:08.110
not maintained my personal brand.
I mean, I think the

314
00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:10.630
per Gerard of word there
is brand because now it

315
00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:13.660
associates, you know, with Coca
Cola and the like, but

316
00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:17.770
North, just this recognition that
your online persona exists. And

317
00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:19.600
if you don't know what
it is, you know, you're

318
00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:22.780
fooling yourself. It theory. I
mean the simplest statement, we

319
00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:25.960
can make it to, to
a teenagers. You really should

320
00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:30.010
have your online persona reflect
your physical persona. They should

321
00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:33.760
be the same. Yeah. Yeah.
That's what a mature person

322
00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:38.650
does. And you're going to
experiment with that as the

323
00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:40.870
same way that you do
in your physical persona and

324
00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:44.260
you're going to make some
mistakes. Yeah, absolutely. It's funny

325
00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.840
that you say that because
I have probably twice a

326
00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:52.500
week, a random people, me
and asking me actually to

327
00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:57.870
delete comments that they made
on my blog because they

328
00:17:57.870 --> 00:18:01.020
use their full name and
they were snarky or they

329
00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:02.880
were smart acids or they
were something. And then their

330
00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:06.060
employer finds them in an
interview. And then they asked

331
00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:08.940
to have them removed. I've
even had people tell me

332
00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:10.860
that their employers would like
them to keep a low

333
00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:16.700
Profile on the web. Someone
actually told me that they

334
00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:19.520
want their employer, wanted them
to not blog because the

335
00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:22.100
employer was afraid that they
would be pinched by other

336
00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:26.150
competitive companies. Like they were
looking to competent on the

337
00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:30.290
internet. Wow. Yeah. And then
there was this whole wave

338
00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:33.500
of you, if you want
to be employed here, we

339
00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:37.400
need your username and password
to your Facebook account. Yes,

340
00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:41.330
absolutely. That's ridiculous. Did you
see regional Braithwaite did a

341
00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:44.750
great parody letter on that
where he pretended to be

342
00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:46.730
the chief of engineering at
a company that did that

343
00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:51.920
and basically wrote a whole
fictional narrative about where that

344
00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:54.200
would eventually go and how
all the C level execs

345
00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:57.560
would have to retire and,
and quit because you just

346
00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:59.270
can't follow that all the
way through. You're going to

347
00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:01.070
get sued if you do
that, there's just no way.

348
00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:04.760
It's ridiculous. Yeah, no, it's,
it's, it's insanity and it's

349
00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:09.500
just, it's fear, irrational fears
that, that can't be managed

350
00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:11.960
effectively. You know, they've just
got to think through what

351
00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:14.150
you got to do Well,
and it's more than just

352
00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:17.210
fear. It's, it's, it's an
inability of regular folks to

353
00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:20.330
understand the issues. I mean,
just look at any time

354
00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:22.970
a patent of any complexity
tries to go through through

355
00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:27.230
legal review. It's, it's just
embarrassing to listen to like

356
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:30.050
the Supreme court to try
to understand something as subtle

357
00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:34.130
as can I remove internet
Explorer or not. Yeah. Well,

358
00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:36.830
I feel like the whole
patent system is very much

359
00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:42.770
like the, the financial system
of, of betting on other

360
00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:46.130
people's loans. You know, they
say this thing is fine,

361
00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:48.560
as long as nobody actually
uses any of them, as

362
00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:50.390
soon as they do the
whole thing's a house of

363
00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:56.420
cards. What, What else are
you thinking about lately? I

364
00:19:56.420 --> 00:20:02.420
read the book information diet.
Okay. Have you read this

365
00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:06.920
information? diet.com is the website
I've heard about it. I've

366
00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:10.520
given talks about ignoring stuff
like yeah. Gave it to

367
00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:14.000
me. I realized that I
think are I watched your,

368
00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:18.800
the talk from New Zealand and,
and you hit on a

369
00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:20.810
few points from the information.
I thought it was really

370
00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:22.790
interesting to get the author's
name is clay Johnson, but

371
00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:25.430
you know, his essence, the
essence of this thing was

372
00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:28.910
this idea that can you
the same way that we

373
00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:34.280
can speak you Asley and
consciously consume food that we,

374
00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:38.270
you know, look at the,
the, the dietary, the, the,

375
00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:41.540
the nutritional content of food.
We should be consuming data

376
00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:46.340
the same way that there's
a plethora of poor quality,

377
00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:49.990
or as he describes pizza
information out there. And you

378
00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:54.420
want the broccoli information. It
was cool though. I liked

379
00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:56.790
that idea. I mean, I
look as a, as a

380
00:20:56.790 --> 00:21:00.090
diabetic, I'm always looking at
the ingredients. I mean, I

381
00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:03.090
want to know what the
corn syrup equivalent of information

382
00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:07.320
is so that I can
avoid it Well, and I'd

383
00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:11.160
also appreciate that his approach
to talking about this tears

384
00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:14.790
down the conspiracy theory stuff,
right. And gets back to

385
00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:18.660
look who's being paid for
what? So, you know, as

386
00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:22.050
much as we recognized television
news is no longer news

387
00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:26.010
it's entertainment right there. And
the motivation there is very

388
00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:28.680
clear. The people who pay
for the news are the

389
00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:32.820
advertisers and the advertisers only
care about the number of

390
00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:36.960
people who can see their
ads. And so you need

391
00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:41.310
to, constructure your new show
to increase viewership and the

392
00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:43.770
way you do that is
not by presenting the news,

393
00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:49.230
you do it by affirming
your audience. And so we

394
00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:52.260
pretty clearly goes through the
process of how you may

395
00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:58.200
render news to make it
affirming to your audience. Hmm.

396
00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:01.200
Well, and also assuming that
they're not idiots is nice.

397
00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:08.070
Well, turns out idiots buy
stuff too. That is unfortunate.

398
00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:10.920
So when we say buy
more stuff, so if you

399
00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:13.380
could actually gather them all
together in one place with

400
00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:16.200
one set of shows, then
you know, you could sell

401
00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:17.610
a lot of stuff because
in the end that's their

402
00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:24.420
job, right? That's what they're
out to do. Yeah. That's

403
00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:27.300
a touchy point for me,
the whole we're selling too

404
00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:31.140
much stuff. Well, the, the,
you know, the basic line

405
00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:34.830
cross there is this idea
that new shows need to

406
00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:39.720
generate advertising revenue. That's the
exact right? And we crossed

407
00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:41.700
that line a very long
time ago. You know, the

408
00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:44.490
other thing I realized, and,
and he, and Johnson sort

409
00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:46.590
of highly brought this up
as well as the fact

410
00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:49.350
that remember when all the
newspapers were going to go

411
00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:54.420
out of business, it just
sort of stopped happening. Right?

412
00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:57.660
Use papers stopped going out
of business. Why is it

413
00:22:57.690 --> 00:23:02.340
people will up to a
point by dead trees? Well,

414
00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:04.350
I don't think it's a
tree part it's that they've

415
00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:08.820
restructured their businesses to be
a lot less expensive. Well,

416
00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:10.920
then that must mean that
the quality has gone down.

417
00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:13.920
Why you would be correct,
sir. They do the same

418
00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:17.190
thing that many other news
news angles are going on

419
00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:19.140
in the internet does as
a whole. They don't produce

420
00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:22.710
any news. They just parrot
it. So fewer and fewer

421
00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:26.280
real news sources and more,
and fewer and fewer reporters

422
00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:29.070
working for newspapers. They're just
pulling in the sources of

423
00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:30.970
news that come from other
places, putting their spin on

424
00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:33.960
it and then republishing them.
Right. Right. You see, like

425
00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:37.110
some, someone will write an
incorrect article and throw it

426
00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:39.600
on the associated press. And
then the AP fee just

427
00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:42.750
gets read by a talking
head. And at that point,

428
00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:46.010
a mistake has become news
because no, actually doing any

429
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:51.460
due diligence anymore, Two sites,
you'd probably appreciate one is

430
00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:57.610
called <inaudible> dot com. Journalism.
Yes. So C H U

431
00:23:57.610 --> 00:24:04.510
R N a L I
S m.com journalism.com. Okay. So,

432
00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:06.370
you know, you have the
anti plagiarism sites where you

433
00:24:06.370 --> 00:24:09.290
can take your, your, a
paper, someone sent you and

434
00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:11.140
run it and it'll compare
it and show you where

435
00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:14.110
it came from. Right. There's
services that teachers can can

436
00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:15.760
subscribe to that will tell
them whether or not kids

437
00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:21.790
are doing that. Exactly. journalism.com,
same thing for journalism stories.

438
00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:24.670
So you take a story,
you paste the text in

439
00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:28.840
and it compares it to
related stories. And she'd show

440
00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:33.550
you generally sources for where
these stories come from. Interesting.

441
00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:36.370
Interesting. I would be nice
to see like a bookmarklet

442
00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:37.870
or some kind of an
add in that would do

443
00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:40.480
that all the time. So
I find totally with you.

444
00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:42.850
Yeah. I want to know
if I'm reading rehashed, so

445
00:24:43.150 --> 00:24:46.000
It doesn't always get a
match. We know this isn't

446
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.100
far from perfect and it
doesn't have every single source

447
00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:51.460
of, of press from anywhere,
but it, every way it

448
00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:52.990
does get a match. It's
really interesting to see the

449
00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:56.350
side-by-side versions. Here's the version
you've got. Here's a couple

450
00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:58.210
of other reference versions that
are clearly the same thing

451
00:24:58.210 --> 00:25:01.960
here's what's removed here is
what was added. Yes, exactly.

452
00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:05.320
Exactly. There's a, there's an
application that I use to

453
00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:08.980
keep track of whether or
not whether or not people

454
00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:13.960
are kind of stealing, borrowing.
Re-blogging my content called fair

455
00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:17.650
share. And they'll actually create
a, an RSS feed and

456
00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:21.070
say, we found, you know,
I really, really similar story

457
00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:25.000
at this URL. And it's
using 70% of your content

458
00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:27.580
out of, you know, X
number of words, out of

459
00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:30.640
the words that you published,
except they've added ads. They

460
00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:33.010
stripped out your ads and
they've added them. So it's

461
00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:35.650
one thing to say. I
like your stuff, Scott, I'm

462
00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:37.300
going to blog part of
it. I'm going to use

463
00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:40.240
250 words and link back
to you, which I encourage.

464
00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:44.230
It's another thing to take
all the content, remove my

465
00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:47.680
ads and put in your
own. Yeah. So then you

466
00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:50.230
get something for nothing. And
I get nothing for all

467
00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:55.810
that Work. Now we talking
about fair, share.attributor.com. Exactly. Exactly.

468
00:25:55.810 --> 00:25:58.120
You can subscribe to that.
It'll watch your feed and

469
00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:00.220
it'll watch the world, and
then it'll tell you whether

470
00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:02.710
or not your stuff's popping
us popping up. All right.

471
00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:04.810
Here's the bad news. I
just went there and they've

472
00:26:04.810 --> 00:26:08.620
shut down as of February
this year. That would explain

473
00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:11.650
why I am not getting
any reports lately. Are they

474
00:26:11.650 --> 00:26:19.870
seriously gone? Oh man. It
sucks. Fair shares and discontinued.

475
00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:24.970
Oh man. Ongoing operational costs.
Oh man. I gotta find

476
00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:28.370
another one. Yup. It was
such a great, Oh man.

477
00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:31.180
And he's exactly what you
want Because what was nice

478
00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:33.310
is that I always recommend
in my blogging talks that

479
00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:37.570
people should licensed their content.
And what I want to

480
00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:39.280
do is say, you can
use this, but not for

481
00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:42.250
commercial reasons. And then they'll
say, well, they've just done.

482
00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:45.780
Exactly. Not that you're taking
your stuff. And they've added

483
00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:49.650
a bunch of ads for
themselves. It's a bummer. All

484
00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:51.770
right. Well, good. I love
that. They publish it as

485
00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:54.590
a free service, but wouldn't
you pay $50 a year

486
00:26:54.650 --> 00:26:56.420
for that Pay 50 bucks
a year is for something

487
00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:59.570
like that. No question. It
was an extremely useful service.

488
00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:03.620
Yeah. I just, it confuses
me that you wouldn't monetize

489
00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:06.800
this Well, and this is
the other thing, right? So

490
00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:09.920
no one will pay for
anything anymore. It's just getting

491
00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:14.210
ridiculous. Well, and that means
like fair shirt go away.

492
00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:17.720
Yeah. Right. Yeah. I mean,
hearing lies the consequences and

493
00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:19.970
I think it's one of
the tougher points that Johnson

494
00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:22.220
gets to towards the end
of information diet is this

495
00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:25.070
idea of, we need to
start paying for good quality

496
00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:28.610
information or it's just going
to die. Well, we need

497
00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:31.220
to simply pay for good
quality period. I am shocked

498
00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:33.710
at the number of people
who will not spend 99 cents

499
00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:36.830
for an application that someone
worked on for hours. And

500
00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:39.890
they'll sit there and they'll
drink a $5 coffee. Yeah.

501
00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:44.120
Well they are researching the
reviews on a 99 cent application.

502
00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:50.120
Yeah. And I'm seeing constantly
open source and open source

503
00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:52.940
slash commercial software shut down
because people won't support them.

504
00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:56.660
I mean, if you use
a library that you love

505
00:27:56.690 --> 00:28:01.160
or there's a product that
you paid a $99 for,

506
00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:05.030
and it's fundamental to your
business, you should tip the

507
00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:09.290
guy for God's sake. What
are you thinking? Are you

508
00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:11.600
okay? I'll give you two
stories related to this where

509
00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:14.270
we were, where I've spent
money and it's served me.

510
00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:19.850
Well, first one was trillion
way back at the beginning.

511
00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:22.580
When, when it wasn't obvious
that MSM was going to

512
00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:26.300
dominate the, the instant messaging,
I was an ICQ user.

513
00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:28.520
I had, you know, yeah.
Who'd so forth. A trillion

514
00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:30.860
brought all us into one
place, right. And way back

515
00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:32.900
in that early version. And
this is literally in the

516
00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:37.880
XP days, I sent him
50 bucks. Let's just cut.

517
00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:40.940
It was just like, Hey
guys, thanks. This saves me

518
00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:42.890
a lot of grief. Because
back then those apps didn't

519
00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:44.930
get along. You couldn't even
run them all at once.

520
00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:49.700
And they put me on
a list that to this

521
00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:53.540
day, I get nice notes
from them and, and new

522
00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:55.880
versions and so forth. And
they've gone through many, many

523
00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:58.700
versions of trillion. Now it's
really evolved there. The, I

524
00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:01.680
still use the product. I
went away from it for

525
00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:03.650
a while, but I came
back because they finally integrated

526
00:29:03.650 --> 00:29:07.610
Skype into it. The useful
way that's pure quality. That

527
00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:09.440
was yet another app I
wanted to get off my

528
00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:11.780
desktop when it came to
messaging and phone and stuff.

529
00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:13.970
So just having one app
for all those things. So

530
00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:17.990
now just recently, it'd be,
this is the museum and

531
00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:19.700
you've met my wife. So,
you know, she's in the

532
00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:23.270
garment industry. She knows how
to do a pattern design

533
00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:25.700
and, and making clothing fit
people properly. I mean, that's

534
00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:27.980
really the thing she does
better than anything else. So

535
00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:30.710
she found, she decided she
needed to have a plotter

536
00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:35.120
expensive piece of machinery. No
two ways about it. And

537
00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:37.850
through three, a friend of
a friend found a 10

538
00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:42.760
year old healing Packard, seven
50 sea plotter. Okay. Now

539
00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:45.970
it had been beautifully maintained.
And literally the guy was

540
00:29:45.970 --> 00:29:48.430
letting it go because he
wasn't using it enough. He

541
00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:50.260
had a new plotter. It
was his backup plotter. It's

542
00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:52.120
like, I just can't justify
letting this thing. Sit here.

543
00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:54.280
It's such a good plotter.
And this it's a beautiful

544
00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:56.890
machine. It's a hundred pounds
worth of hardware. This is

545
00:29:56.890 --> 00:30:00.130
back when he lived Packard,
still used metal in their

546
00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:04.750
printers is a great piece
of machinery. Yeah, absolutely not

547
00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:08.940
supported to windows seven at
all. See, that's tragic. Yeah.

548
00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:11.140
It's not, it's not windows
seven's fault. It's the driver

549
00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:14.460
dies. They don't care about
that anymore. Right? No. They

550
00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:20.940
don't found a company in
Australia called wind line and

551
00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:25.230
they make plotter drivers. Oh,
see, I love that. When

552
00:30:25.230 --> 00:30:27.420
people take a product and
bring it back to life.

553
00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:30.330
Yeah. I will pay not
free. In fact, not cheap

554
00:30:30.570 --> 00:30:33.690
200 bucks for the driver.
Let's see if you've got

555
00:30:33.690 --> 00:30:37.380
a multi thousand dollar metal
quality plotter that you love

556
00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:40.160
and your business relies on
it. That's a bargain. And,

557
00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:41.730
and this is the, I
sat down and did the

558
00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:44.460
math with the wife. And
we're just talking this through.

559
00:30:44.490 --> 00:30:48.300
I can stand up a
little machine, you know, running

560
00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:51.780
XP with the Haley packer
driver. And you'll have to

561
00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:53.640
use that machine every time
you want to print. So

562
00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:55.710
you'll generate your files on
your big, fast machine. And

563
00:30:55.710 --> 00:30:57.450
you'll take this file transfer
to this machine. And we've

564
00:30:57.450 --> 00:31:01.950
got to keep all that
stuff running or 200 bucks.

565
00:31:02.010 --> 00:31:05.070
And it was try before
you buy right. You download

566
00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:06.630
the driver and run it.
And it just prints a

567
00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:09.930
watermark on anything you plot
until you pay, pay, get

568
00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:11.820
the license to pay for
the driver. So we, so

569
00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:13.950
I install it and then
I'm used to the battle

570
00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:17.070
of drivers, right? I'm an
expert at this. I install,

571
00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:19.920
the driver comes up. It
says, what kind of plotter

572
00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:22.080
have you got? We got
an HP SevenFifty is six

573
00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:25.320
50 C. It says, is
this the jet direct idea

574
00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:26.910
of it? Because I already
had it hooked to the

575
00:31:26.910 --> 00:31:29.670
network. I go, yeah, that's
it plots on it done.

576
00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:35.070
That's fabulous. It worked exactly
the way. And it's the

577
00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:36.720
best 200 bucks I've ever
spent. I swear. I mean,

578
00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:40.950
that is not it. And
everything about that upsets you

579
00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:42.900
right at your gut. It's
like drivers should be free.

580
00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:45.690
Drivers should be free, right?
Like apps should be 99 cents.

581
00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:49.650
Drivers should be free. There's
no, for two, that was

582
00:31:49.650 --> 00:31:52.770
worth way more than $200
in terms of quality of

583
00:31:52.770 --> 00:31:55.860
life. I don't think Three,
four, something like that. I

584
00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:59.340
mean, I've got a, a
space orb, which is one

585
00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:03.090
of the greatest 3d game
controllers ever created. And I've

586
00:32:03.090 --> 00:32:05.730
been struggling trying to get
that thing to work in

587
00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:07.860
windows, just plug it in.
If someone would write a

588
00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:10.680
driver that would just work,
just plug it in. And

589
00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:13.110
it works on like an
Xbox controller. I'd pay a

590
00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:16.020
hundred bucks for that. It's
a fantastic piece of hardware.

591
00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:18.960
That's dead. And there's a
black market for them on

592
00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:21.420
eBay, but we always struggled
to get them to do

593
00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:25.860
anything. Yeah. It's tough. I
want to move one more

594
00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:28.650
call back to information diet
you're talking about, you know,

595
00:32:28.650 --> 00:32:31.050
lies on the internet and
the propagation. Have you ever

596
00:32:31.050 --> 00:32:37.020
been to gullible.info? Are you
going to make me get

597
00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:38.970
a liberal? I love this.
This is just your kind

598
00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:44.230
of, okay. I'm there. Gullible.info
is literally just sort of

599
00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:50.530
proof of the problem of
search engines and, and, you

600
00:32:50.530 --> 00:32:57.370
know, data propagation, everything on
gullible.info is a lie. It's

601
00:32:57.370 --> 00:33:03.100
all false. Every single thing
is false. They're just facts

602
00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:10.030
posted routinely that are false
and yet take any of

603
00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:13.240
the, any of the, the,
the, these points and search

604
00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:16.660
on them. And you will
find them propagated often into

605
00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:21.760
Wikipedia. Here's one, the sale
of 1% milk has declined

606
00:33:21.790 --> 00:33:24.940
nearly 26% since the beginning
of the occupy wall street

607
00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:30.700
protests. All right. So I'm
going to search for that

608
00:33:31.930 --> 00:33:38.200
and exactly as it is.
And I can find, let

609
00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:39.460
me see, I'm going to
put quotes around it to

610
00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:43.450
make sure that that's not,
there's 500 other places on

611
00:33:43.450 --> 00:33:48.820
the internet that that has
been copy pasted. Awesome. So

612
00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:51.880
there's a story about one
of the, one of the

613
00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:54.460
statements. This is from a
couple of years back, was

614
00:33:54.700 --> 00:34:01.630
Timothy Leary invented a new
color and some overachiever on

615
00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:05.710
Wikipedia, expanding little Timothy Leary,
Ray reference just grabs that

616
00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:08.860
sticks it in Wikipedia, and
then a newspaper in the

617
00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:13.300
UK doing their quote fact
checking goes to Wikipedia, adds

618
00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:18.970
that fact to a story.
Oh my goodness. Yeah. That's

619
00:34:18.970 --> 00:34:21.550
pretty awesome. That's that, that
makes it very difficult when

620
00:34:21.550 --> 00:34:23.140
the, you know, the whole
internet is a big joke

621
00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:28.870
though. Well, I mean, yes,
where there's this sense of,

622
00:34:28.870 --> 00:34:31.360
if you're not re how
do you actually check for

623
00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:33.010
facts on the internet? How
do you really do it?

624
00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:37.390
Yeah. Well, remember that, that,
that is a scale. Just

625
00:34:37.390 --> 00:34:42.490
like recognizing that information can
leak being, being savvy and

626
00:34:42.490 --> 00:34:46.030
knowing that things smell bad,
doesn't quite smell, right. That

627
00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:48.400
is a skill itself that
people need to learn. Children

628
00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:51.350
need to learn. Yes. And
I think it's part of

629
00:34:51.350 --> 00:34:53.110
the, part of the, you
know, I've been showing these

630
00:34:53.110 --> 00:34:55.540
sites to parents and just
saying you should and sending

631
00:34:55.540 --> 00:34:59.710
them to Snopes. You know,
just when I see these

632
00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:02.560
old arguments come back through,
you know, being propagated by

633
00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:05.200
family members, for example, I
don't argue with them anymore.

634
00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:08.350
Just send them the Snopes
link, click. This has been

635
00:35:08.350 --> 00:35:10.630
run down and I don't
need to talk about it

636
00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:12.880
Anymore. I always hate being
the bad guy though. I

637
00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:15.370
always get accused amongst the
family as being the guy.

638
00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:17.710
That's like, you know, I'll
get the, is this true?

639
00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:19.720
Is this true? No, it's
not do bill Gates is

640
00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:21.280
going to give us all
a thousand dollars if we

641
00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:27.520
email him. No, no. And
then I'm the downer. I'm

642
00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:29.770
the bad guy. Yeah. You're
no fun. I saw a

643
00:35:29.770 --> 00:35:31.540
great tweet from one of
our friends and I can't

644
00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:33.280
remember which one it was.
He says, I'm glad I'm

645
00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:35.740
at a place where all
of my friends are mature

646
00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:39.660
enough using email that there
are No more jokey emails

647
00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:43.200
going around in my life.
I've got a couple, a

648
00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:48.390
couple of uncles, couple of
cousins, but yeah, for the

649
00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:52.260
most part, I'm almost there.
Yeah. Yeah. And you can't,

650
00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:54.570
you can't force him to
grow up the attic he's

651
00:35:54.570 --> 00:35:57.930
given to the app. He's
given enough time. Eventually they

652
00:35:57.930 --> 00:36:00.210
figure it out. Exactly. Well,
thanks for hanging out with

653
00:36:00.210 --> 00:36:02.970
me today with your Campbell.
Always a pleasure. My friend,

654
00:36:03.810 --> 00:36:07.230
this has been another episode
of Hansel minutes, Hansel, minutia.

655
00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:09.630
What's your Campbell. See you
again next week.
