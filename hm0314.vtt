this episode, Scott talks with

6
00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.660
his wife Mo about how
to manage a mixed text

7
00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:47.840
slash normal marriage. Hi, this
is Scott Hanselman. This is

8
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.730
another episode of Hansel minutes.
I have done 300 and

9
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.740
something 11, 12 shows. And
to this day, which are

10
00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.740
all my technical accomplishments, the
most popular show that we

11
00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.360
have ever done on Hansel
minutes was talking to my

12
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:09.410
wife, my wife. Hello wife.
Hey, so the people have

13
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.620
spoken. They are not interested
in highly technical content or

14
00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.670
open source libraries. They want
to talk to you, But

15
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.830
super cool, especially, Oh, the
phone rings. Is it the

16
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.730
phone? I said to turn
off, I believe that's your

17
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:31.010
phone. That's not my phone.
Alright. Did they just tell

18
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:36.740
you to turn your phone
off? Okay. Yeah. So people

19
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.190
want to hear from you.
That's cool. I, this is

20
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.010
going to say before your
phone rang that I always

21
00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.080
feel like I could call
in when like got reads

22
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.320
out available or fell hack
or Rob or any of

23
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.060
those guys. So woo Show.
You're my you're my second.

24
00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:58.610
That's right? Yeah, we were.
So we live outside of

25
00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.420
town and we were driving
in and a couple of

26
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.190
months ago, I want to
say six months ago, maybe

27
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.650
you insisted that we go
straight and I want to

28
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.610
turn right, because turning right
as the quicker way home,

29
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.770
and you had said, no,
no, I've been doing this

30
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.560
other way. I drive this
other way home. And I've

31
00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.260
been doing this for months.
You told me like, what,

32
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.690
why would, why are you
doing, why would you go

33
00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.330
this way and be like,
Oh, well, there's fewer lights.

34
00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.830
And you described this way
to get home that you

35
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.690
were, that you were going.
And I was showing you

36
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:35.420
on the map that, and
the word of the day,

37
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.650
that day was demonstrably. How
the word, that way home

38
00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:46.280
is demonstrably, slower demonstrably. Write
it down. How, okay. The

39
00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.970
argument started where you didn't
understand, you didn't agree that

40
00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.390
the map, what, what was
the deal? Why would you

41
00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.460
not just accept that? That
was not the quickest way

42
00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.430
home. I love the fact
that you have trouble putting

43
00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.420
it in a diplomatic. The,
the issue, the issue is

44
00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.360
this, you said, no, no,
you go down this street

45
00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.490
and then you turn right
here. And it's like way

46
00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.130
faster. And I looked at
the map and it was

47
00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.190
almost like, you know, I'm
drawing this line like way

48
00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.320
down here and then way
up here. And I'm like,

49
00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.020
it was an issue of
it wasn't even mapping. It

50
00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.070
was geometry. I'm just like,
this is way out of

51
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.010
the way. Why you didn't
want to hear about the

52
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.050
map. I tried to show
you the GPS map. And

53
00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.970
I said, look, and you
said, I didn't want to

54
00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.830
see your maps. Well, look,
I mean, I think you

55
00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.440
have two different people who
are competent, who can get

56
00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.050
the job done. And by
competent, I'm talking about myself

57
00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.810
and you know, you're competent
to, in your own small

58
00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.260
way. No, we were two
different people. And I think

59
00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.600
it's important for your listeners
to understand that you and

60
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.320
I are very similar people.
We, we get the job

61
00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.200
done at the end, but
it's the execution that always

62
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.900
kills us because we always
want to do it two

63
00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.480
different ways. We get to
the same point at the

64
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.610
end, but how we get
these very, very different. So

65
00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.460
all I was saying was
why not skip the lights?

66
00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.410
I mean, I think we're
going from my sister's house

67
00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.890
home, which is about 42
lights in between. My recommendation

68
00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.530
was go ahead and avoid
the lights and go the

69
00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.110
road that allows you to
go 55 miles per hour,

70
00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.470
right? The flow the way
with fewer lights, except that

71
00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:25.650
way a cursory glance would
show you it was 17

72
00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:31.770
miles South Southwest of where
we were going, Right? And

73
00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.740
again, not to rehash this
issue, No, this is people

74
00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.530
who are deeply interested in
this issue. People are deeply

75
00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.950
interested in this, Right? So
my thinking was because we're

76
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.830
going significantly faster than if
you go through the lights,

77
00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.160
new going 35 miles per
hour, doing the math will

78
00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.960
mean that at some point
it's going to be faster

79
00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.210
to go 55 miles per
hour than it is 35

80
00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.640
miles an hour. Right? So
the problem that I was

81
00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.820
having though, is that doing
the math, even the cursory

82
00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.210
math showed immediately that this
was a problem. So what

83
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.850
we ended up doing was
Moe would go this way

84
00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:07.470
for months. And I would
go the other way until

85
00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.900
we finally found ourselves in
a situation where we both

86
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.240
were on that one side
of town with two cars.

87
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.590
Right. And we stopped at
a, I said, okay, here

88
00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.900
we are. We happen to
be in right behind each

89
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.020
other. Let's go, you go
straight. I'll turn right. And

90
00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.830
I'll meet you at hot
home. And I got there

91
00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.410
15 minutes earlier than you
did. And you thought I

92
00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:32.520
was lying to me Clear,
you have been known to

93
00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.240
be generous. Shall I say
in your use of the

94
00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.940
item? Well, whenever someone says,
whenever you're on the phone

95
00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.160
with someone, they say, well,
where are you? You could

96
00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.890
either tell them that you're
wherever you, like, if you

97
00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:46.080
just pass something, you could
like look to your right

98
00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.970
and say, I just pass
it. Or you could look

99
00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.540
as far forward in the
horizon as possible. And then

100
00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:54.690
pick a, a, an exit
that you can barely see

101
00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:57.200
just as the curvature of
the earth is coming up.

102
00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.210
And you could say, Oh,
I'm at that exit. Cause

103
00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:01.400
I'm basically there. I can
see exactly I'll be there

104
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.530
in 10 minutes. But in
this instance, no, I got

105
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.570
home and I told you
I'm here. And it was

106
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:10.010
about 13 minutes. So I
thought that I had used

107
00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:14.120
a wormhole or some teleportation
device to achieve this accomplishment.

108
00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:17.620
Yeah. I mean, I, I
will say I was shocked

109
00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.530
and I do not use
that word lightly. I was

110
00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:24.880
shocked at how much faster
you were. You were home

111
00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.560
when you said you were
home. And I just, I

112
00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.040
didn't see that. So the
question is, and I think

113
00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.500
this is a common in
what I call mixed marriages,

114
00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:36.580
cakes and normals, right? Presuming
you're the normal, and this

115
00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:42.670
is just checking in geek
relationships. I felt this was

116
00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:46.660
very, very logical. And it
seems like when I refer

117
00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.720
back to a map or
anytime I invoke the laws

118
00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:57.250
of physics, geometry, or the
calculus in a conversation, and

119
00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.980
I'm realizing now, after 12
years of marriage, that's not

120
00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:06.010
working for you. Why Effectively?
It's like, you're not speaking

121
00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:08.890
my language. Look, if you're
trying to communicate with your

122
00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:11.260
wife whom you love more
than anything else in this

123
00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.950
world, not as I say
that, yes, not okay. You've

124
00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:16.810
got to be able to
speak to me in a

125
00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:19.570
way that works for me.
So I, I generally refer

126
00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:21.760
to that as speaking my
language. What is it that

127
00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:23.560
you want? Well, you want
to have a conversation with

128
00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.820
your wife while you can
do it. One of two

129
00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:26.410
ways. You can say it
in a manner that she

130
00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:29.620
will understand you and can
engage in the conversation, or

131
00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:32.680
you can use Greek, which
she doesn't speak. And when

132
00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.750
you're looking at me and
saying, so are we heading

133
00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:37.240
North Northwest or wide? And
I say, well, whereby the

134
00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.940
Safeway do with that information,
what you will. And you're

135
00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:43.150
like, so is that East?
I'm like no idea just

136
00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:46.450
by saying, Right. That's what
I think that sometimes geeks

137
00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:51.070
nerds to Abe's computer people
have trouble understanding is that

138
00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:57.880
if we can't agree on
the four directions, you know

139
00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:59.650
what I mean? Like if
we can't simply agree that

140
00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:03.910
that's North and more specifically,
that North provides value, like

141
00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:07.090
the knowledge of North refined
value. So in this instance,

142
00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:10.210
I felt like it was
a matter of, I drew

143
00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:13.150
a line from point a
where we were to point

144
00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:17.770
B the house and I
drew the straightest line that

145
00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:22.840
I could. And you drew
a line that like wildly

146
00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:25.390
flew off the page and
then came back, was a

147
00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:28.540
zigzag kind of a lightning
bolt and then tried to,

148
00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:31.900
well, it turns out it
wasn't, but you tried to

149
00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:34.210
sell me that. That's what
became frustrating is when I

150
00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:37.000
said, well, I, this is
where it got interesting. I

151
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.550
said, the GPS says that
it's like 15 miles longer.

152
00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:45.340
And you said, I don't
care what the GPS says.

153
00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.550
I believe what I said
was it's been known to

154
00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:51.790
be wrong before which it
has, But then so within

155
00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:53.260
it, this is where we
get into the computer mind.

156
00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.850
Right, right. It's right. More,
it's wrong. And I would

157
00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:59.880
say that the preponderance of
evidence and the multibillion dollar

158
00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:04.680
GPS industry is on my
side. Why are you, so

159
00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:07.560
you always talk about having
faith that you have the

160
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.660
faith that you know, what
you're doing and you're competent

161
00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:12.000
and then data. But in
this instance, you were literally

162
00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:15.030
throwing against not only the
face of logic and direction

163
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:19.350
and the compass directions, but
also the entire GPS community

164
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:22.950
and the entire industry, because
it might've been wrong. Yeah.

165
00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:27.630
It could have been wrong.
But I mean, that, that,

166
00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:30.150
that logic stuff doesn't work.
Right. I mean, like, but

167
00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:32.310
at the same time, apply
that to when, when I,

168
00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.590
when we go to dinner,
parties and stuff, and then

169
00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:38.880
all my logic doesn't work.
Right. You know, you call

170
00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:44.460
this EEQ versus IQ. Right.
The emotional quotient, like, what

171
00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:46.020
was the thing that I
did at your brother's house

172
00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:49.610
with the kitchen? Oh, well,
which time Oh, if the

173
00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:52.980
color, the color of the
kitchen. Right? Right. So we,

174
00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:55.760
we walked into my brother's
house and he had repainted

175
00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:59.120
his house, yellow. And you
in your infinite wisdom said,

176
00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:02.330
I don't like that. Right.
Well, I don't think I

177
00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:04.340
said it quite like that,
but I said, wow, that's

178
00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:07.340
really very yellow. And I
don't care for it. Did

179
00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:09.410
I really say that to
that effect yet? I don't

180
00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:11.360
know if I did quite
say that, but the point

181
00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:14.570
was that it was exceedingly
yellow, he must have known

182
00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:16.670
that it was yellow. I
mean, it was hard to

183
00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:20.180
hear him speak because it
was so loud. It was

184
00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:26.390
just extremely yellow kitchen. And
I didn't understand why that,

185
00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:31.970
why that was a problem.
Well, again, I mean, you

186
00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:34.250
know, it's, it's the same
thing I've said before though.

187
00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:36.950
What is it that you're
trying to accomplish here once,

188
00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:38.630
you know, what the answer
to that question is, then

189
00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:40.310
you can sort of figure
out how to get there.

190
00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:43.160
Right. I think you were
probably trying to say, Hey,

191
00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.620
I noticed that you painted.
Right. And you're saying, Hey,

192
00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:47.930
I noticed something's different. Yeah.
That's probably fair to say

193
00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:50.360
so that there were other
ways to have said that

194
00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:54.050
in a manner that was
less, it was very direct,

195
00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:57.380
right. In a culture that
is perhaps less direct. You

196
00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:59.690
know, you, you go through
that whole idea of saving

197
00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:02.000
face. Yeah. Show. It was
bride yesterday. He didn't care

198
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.120
for it. But you know,
the African standards says you

199
00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.340
don't need to necessarily walk
in through the door. And

200
00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:11.270
however nicely you said, the
underlying message was that's bright.

201
00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:13.910
I don't care for it.
You know, it's not your

202
00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:18.080
house thoughtfulness. And apart you
were coming at it from

203
00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:19.610
the point of view is,
Hey, I'm giving you honest

204
00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:23.840
feedback, you know, but it
really landed like, wow, okay.

205
00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:26.480
So he is a rude
guy who just flew in

206
00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.970
all the way from the
United States. And the second thing

207
00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:31.940
he says after, hi, how
are you? You're yeah, you're

208
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.680
overselling it a little bit,
but I hear you saying,

209
00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:37.460
do you think that if
you, have you found any

210
00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:39.920
other engineers, like we have
other couple friends and stuff

211
00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:42.530
where there's an engineer with
the woman's engineer that man's

212
00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:44.840
engineer, is this a gender
thing or is this an

213
00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:48.560
engineer thing? No, That's pretty
much a Hanselman thing. You

214
00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:52.730
can, you can own that.
I'm being serious though. Is

215
00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:54.190
it? It's not just the
handsome thing. I mean, come

216
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:56.920
on. Do you think that
this is my work feedback?

217
00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:01.720
Like my work persona, that's
leaking into the personal life

218
00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:04.180
where it's like, let's take
care of business. Let's, you

219
00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:06.130
know, let's come to a
quorum and let's move forward

220
00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:09.000
with the next action item.
Well, sure. I mean, again,

221
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.430
you've got to understand that
it's, it's a function of

222
00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:13.650
what you spend most of
your time doing, right? To

223
00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:16.140
the extent that you're spending
eight, nine, sometimes 10 hours,

224
00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:19.260
12 hours a day, working
with engineers, people who think

225
00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:22.770
like you, right. It's a
process in the manner that

226
00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:24.930
you process at the speed
that you process. When you

227
00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:26.850
shift from that, you, you
know, we talked about this,

228
00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:29.460
I think once before, where
you almost need to decompress

229
00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:31.380
a little bit before you
are a fit for the

230
00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:34.200
rest of society, you know
what I mean? Almost like

231
00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:37.410
it's a, it's a, it's
an engineer technologist version of

232
00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:40.680
the Benz, right? The Benz,
or when you're deep underwater

233
00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:42.630
in a scuba tank. And
if you come up too

234
00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:45.450
fast, you'll explode. She got
to come up real slow

235
00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:49.020
and you gotta start decompression
chamber. Maybe engineers need some

236
00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:52.410
kind of decompression chamber for
them to realize that coming

237
00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:55.680
in and like all come
out of the office because

238
00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:58.260
I work from home and
I'll go over and then

239
00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:03.450
like, maybe dinner's cooking and
you're making me sad now

240
00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:05.970
because I'm going to wince.
But I'm like, is this

241
00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:09.240
what we're having? Or is
that how you cook? Is

242
00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:11.190
there enough oil here? Are
we cooking? You know? And

243
00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:14.370
it's just like, I've immediately
gone into like code review

244
00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:18.150
mode of the rice and
meat that we're about to

245
00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:20.460
have. Right. Right. And then,
I mean, I do that

246
00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:22.590
too. Right. I spend a
lot of time say with

247
00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:25.500
the boys and they are
busy, they are biting their

248
00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:28.590
nails, scratching each other. They
are not listening. They're using

249
00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:32.910
the loud voices. And I
sometimes catch myself saying inside

250
00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:35.250
voices, please. And I'm talking
to you, look at me.

251
00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:38.040
And you're like, wow, okay.
That, you know, how on

252
00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:40.380
earth is that applicable here?
Well, I heard you're saying

253
00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:44.070
something somewhat loudly and I
immediately went to inside forests.

254
00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:46.350
See, that's really interesting. I'm
glad that you actually are

255
00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:52.020
bringing up this issue here
in a public forum, because

256
00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:54.360
I think it's interesting that,
that I do get into

257
00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:56.910
an engineer mode and that
doesn't work for you. But

258
00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:58.470
at the same time, I
think it's cool that you

259
00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:01.770
just recognize that sometimes you'll
like yell at me about

260
00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:06.690
a couple of days ago
from word lowercase, Y the

261
00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:10.260
cabinets in the kitchen, I
open them and then I

262
00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.270
walk away. But in my
mind, I'll get to them.

263
00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:14.790
I'll close them later, but
you want them closed immediately.

264
00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:16.590
That's the kind of thing
you tell a four year

265
00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:20.850
old. Right. But I'm a
grown ass man. Like you,

266
00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:24.210
you know what I mean?
But the question is then

267
00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:27.000
when you, especially when you
have kids, who are we,

268
00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:30.090
if I deal with engineers
all day and you deal

269
00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:32.220
with four year olds all
day, let me come back

270
00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:34.050
together. And I'm talking to
you like an engineer, and

271
00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:36.330
you're talking to me like
a four year old. Right,

272
00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:39.480
right. How do we reconcile
that kind of stuff? Exactly.

273
00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:43.050
And it is hard. It
is hard because you know,

274
00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:45.420
the audience that I'm working
with and talking to is

275
00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:48.510
shifted. And if my brain
doesn't shift fast enough, you

276
00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:51.200
can end up with, you
know, a mixture of those

277
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:53.030
two worlds kind of blending
into each other where it's

278
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:55.580
like, Whoa, I'm talking to,
you know, 38 year old

279
00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:57.500
Scott as if he's four
and I'm talking to a

280
00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.410
four year old, you know,
T as if he's, if

281
00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:03.500
he's 30, I mean, it's,
it's about the benefit of

282
00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.890
the doubt, Right? And that
is the thing that we

283
00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:08.500
have found. Actually, we were
working on this, this book

284
00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:10.240
that continues to be worked
on a year or two

285
00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:12.640
later. We'll talk about that
in a second. But this

286
00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:15.640
idea of benefit of the
doubt is so important. It's

287
00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:20.560
like being deferential, the idea
that there's 6 billion people in

288
00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:23.770
the world. Right. But you're
the one that I've decided

289
00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:25.500
to hang out with. Or
I guess you decided to

290
00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:28.270
hang out with me, lucky,
lucky you, I had no

291
00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:30.190
choice in the matter. I'm
lucky you even talked to

292
00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:34.540
me at this point, but
I'm on your side and

293
00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:36.790
you're on my side. And
to remember that is so

294
00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:38.950
important in any relationship. Cause
you know, you come home

295
00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:40.720
and you're tired and I
come home and I'm tired.

296
00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:46.000
It's difficult to remember that
I'm not here to make

297
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.570
your life more difficult. It
just seems. That makes sense.

298
00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:53.050
Right? Yeah. How do you
deal with that? I mean,

299
00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:55.390
how do you feel that
that's hard to remember? Well,

300
00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:57.370
well it is, I mean,
ended, it depends on what's

301
00:15:57.370 --> 00:15:59.830
going on, right? When, when
the boys are doing particularly

302
00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:02.470
well, it's like, Oh, we
have such beautiful babies who

303
00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:05.140
are awesome. Right? You feel
good about that? It's particularly

304
00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:07.630
harder when there's a challenge
or there's a compelling, you

305
00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:09.670
know, there's a push against,
Oh, I think we should

306
00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:12.430
do this. And you're pushing
back saying, no, not only

307
00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:14.140
should we not do that.
That idea is ridiculous in

308
00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:16.720
the first place. You know,
not because you're saying those

309
00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:19.390
words, I just feel like
you're saying that. So the

310
00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:21.640
idea that we are on
the same team, I mean,

311
00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:24.230
we chose to be together.
We chose to, to, to,

312
00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:26.230
to love each other and
be together. And we're happy

313
00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:28.540
that way, even though it
doesn't always look like it,

314
00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:32.380
you know, every waking moment,
one of the, Well, and

315
00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:34.810
when you bring in kids
to the situation or solving

316
00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:38.200
a problem like that, like
without getting into any specific,

317
00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.240
let's say that, you know,
they got child number one

318
00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:42.760
and you think the child
number one should do something

319
00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:45.370
this summer. And I think
that that's not a good

320
00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:47.650
idea, child number one's time
is better spent doing something

321
00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:51.040
else. We're both. W w
we, we can get into

322
00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:58.840
really, really animated discussions, animated,
animated discussions. You know, you

323
00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:01.660
can get into lowercase, a
arguments about this kind of

324
00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:05.050
stuff, and then it can
go, it can get nasty

325
00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:07.270
if, but if you have
to remember that we both

326
00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:09.490
love child number one, and
we want him to be

327
00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:13.830
successful. Right. But when you
come to a, to a

328
00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:17.440
M, if you're not careful,
one of us can get

329
00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:19.780
into the, well, you know,
you don't care about the

330
00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:23.200
kid enough, or you're not
focused on his success. Those

331
00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:24.430
are the kinds of things
where I think the word

332
00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:26.290
that, that term, the benefit
of the doubt comes in.

333
00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:29.920
You've got to remember you,
not you. But one has

334
00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:32.830
to remember that we each
love the child. We each

335
00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:35.650
love the child. We want
it to be successful. We

336
00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:39.730
just differ on a particular
implementation. Is that exactly? As

337
00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:42.400
I said before that for
us, it's the execution of

338
00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:44.080
the stuff in the middle.
I mean, we, we are

339
00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:46.870
very good on the theory.
We agree. Yes. Kids need

340
00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:50.130
to be educated. Education is
awesome. Great. Right. How to

341
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:52.980
do it is where we
sometimes get into, into, into

342
00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:56.040
issues. But as you said,
I mean, we both love

343
00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:57.870
our kids. We both want
to see them succeed and

344
00:17:57.870 --> 00:18:01.410
thrive and be healthy and
well. And even though the

345
00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:06.570
suggestions you have initially come
across as really ridiculous and

346
00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:09.200
not thought out at all,
and you are wrong. I

347
00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:11.450
hope that your, your, your
snark comes over on the,

348
00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:14.630
on the podcast. What's no,
we'll edit it right away.

349
00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:17.600
No, but what I do
know to be true is

350
00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:19.550
you, you have the boys
as interests at heart. You

351
00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:21.530
love them very much as
much as I do. So

352
00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:25.070
it isn't always easy in
the moment, but to come

353
00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:27.230
back and kind of step
away sometimes helps to, to

354
00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:29.660
come. They'd say, you know,
I'm not at a place

355
00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:31.760
right now where can really
hear what you are saying,

356
00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:33.920
because as you speak, I
have these ideas that are

357
00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:36.290
coming up in my mind
and I lose your words

358
00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:38.900
to the picture I'm painting.
So I'm going to separate

359
00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:42.620
myself for whatever, you know.
Yeah. And just kind of

360
00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:44.120
think about it a little
bit and then come back

361
00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:46.250
because I do agree. It's
the benefit of the doubt

362
00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:48.410
when the same time we're
working together Well, and putting

363
00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:51.920
it into, into engineering terms
for myself and for the

364
00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:55.460
listeners, the idea that we
agree on the design, we

365
00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:58.010
agree on the vision. We
agree on the mission statement.

366
00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:01.730
We differ on implementation. Right?
And one of the things,

367
00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:03.740
when I was working at
Intel, that they always remind

368
00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:07.220
us of reminded us about
was the notion of disagree

369
00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:11.600
and commit. Right. We've used
that in our marriage. Haven't

370
00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:17.630
we? Right? There's this idea
that, that, okay, I'm not

371
00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:20.840
a hundred percent on board
with this way, but I

372
00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:22.880
know that it will be
fine in the end. It

373
00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:27.500
is. There's an implementation detail
that I don't like, but

374
00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.300
we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll
achieve the goal. So I'm

375
00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:33.320
going to disagree, but I
will commit, but the trick

376
00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:35.480
would disagree and commit is
you don't get to complain

377
00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:38.090
about it. Right. Cause if
you don't what happens? I

378
00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:41.810
told you so exactly. And
resentment and yeah. And that's

379
00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:42.740
one of the things that
we talked about in the

380
00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:44.930
last show was that I
told you, so leads to

381
00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:47.180
resentment and resentment is the
number one thing that will

382
00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:52.790
kill a marriage or a
relationship. Exactly. Yeah. But you

383
00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:54.890
talked a little bit about
the book. I think we

384
00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:57.590
should, that's an example. That's
a good example of implementation,

385
00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:59.630
but we can. No, that's
okay. That's a great, so,

386
00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:01.910
so we got this book
that we talked about at

387
00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:04.880
the end of the last
show, and we were going

388
00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:07.250
to put it up on
the web and start working

389
00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:09.560
on it. And we've got
like, I think like five

390
00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:12.800
or six chapters done. Right.
So I went and put

391
00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:15.890
it online, not the book,
but the intent to write

392
00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:20.000
the book at a website
called lean pub. It's a

393
00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:22.520
publishing site because I thought
about the book in terms

394
00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:24.820
of source code, I'm going
to write it and I'm

395
00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:26.810
gonna build it. And people
will be able to subscribe

396
00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:28.520
and watch it and I
can get lots of feedback.

397
00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:33.170
And you thought, I didn't
think that for me, the

398
00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:37.280
book was this awesome, warm
and fuzzy project that Moe

399
00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:39.110
and Scott were going to
work on. And it was

400
00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:42.740
just this intimate, great thing.
And we're going to take

401
00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:46.040
our time and, you know,
ride it step away, come

402
00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:49.180
back rewrite. You know? So,
so my vision was a

403
00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:52.060
lot softer. It was a
lot more laid back was

404
00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:55.300
a lot more private of
the process than, than I

405
00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:59.290
think what you had in
mind. So imagine my joy.

406
00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:03.250
When you told me that
you had put up this,

407
00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:06.780
It's just a one page
informational site to collect interest

408
00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:08.370
on whether or not people
wanted to read the book.

409
00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:11.880
Exactly. So I, I didn't,
I, to me, what I

410
00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:14.190
thought I heard was you
saying, Oh, I've created this,

411
00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:16.170
this website for the book.
And I just thought, Oh

412
00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:19.830
no, you know, this, this
is not the private take

413
00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:23.160
your time. Enjoyed, enjoy the
process of it thing I

414
00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:26.100
had in mind. But this
is where I think we

415
00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:29.550
differ not only on implementation,
but on vision. It's a

416
00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:35.130
book, books are read by
other people. It's not a

417
00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:38.940
journal. I didn't suggest that
we write in a diary

418
00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:40.860
that we know it's not
like the loving book that

419
00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:42.660
will just sit on the
love seat and read about,

420
00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:45.420
you know, to ourselves. I
presume there would be more

421
00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:48.360
than two people reading the
book. Right. Well, hopefully. Right.

422
00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:51.510
Yeah. But at the same
time, my, my job, what

423
00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:56.220
I do is to execute
and with, with this podcast

424
00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:59.670
or with stuff I do
with Rob Connery or stuff

425
00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:02.850
I do at work, let's
get it done. Like I

426
00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:05.460
just did this. I didn't
tell you this yet. But

427
00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:08.580
that, that productivity video that
I did in New Zealand, that's

428
00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:11.280
up and, you know, giving
it away. And it's just

429
00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:12.960
part of the web, you
know, did it Webstock and

430
00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:14.790
everyone gets to listen to
it. And it's great. Free,

431
00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:18.840
free love. Right. Execute, execute,
execute. Right. Give a great

432
00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:21.660
talk, get it videoed. Webstock
guys are awesome. They made

433
00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:24.510
it happen. They put it
out there all day. So

434
00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:26.670
when the book idea came
up, it's like, let's execute.

435
00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:29.730
Right. Right. Let's see how
let's see how quickly we

436
00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:32.820
can get a great book
out there. And then as

437
00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:36.360
they say, in engineering, fail
fast, right? If the book

438
00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:39.960
sucks, you get feedback, you
update the book and then

439
00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:41.700
you make it better. So
I thought that we would

440
00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:44.800
be crowdsourcing ideas. And you
were like, I don't know,

441
00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:46.590
this is, this is for
us. I don't care what

442
00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:49.740
the crowd says. Right. Right.
I mean, again, for me,

443
00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:52.200
it was the journey. You
know, you, you have a,

444
00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:55.530
I mean, an efficiency and
you can be ruthlessly efficient

445
00:22:55.590 --> 00:23:00.120
and extremely effective at getting
things done. I mean, between

446
00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:02.700
your family, my family, hands
down, you are the number

447
00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:05.520
one person that we turn
to when there's a problem.

448
00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:08.150
And we needed handled and
everybody's thrashing, and we don't

449
00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:11.060
know exactly what he would
be or whatever. You know

450
00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:13.170
what we're thrashing, you know,
the left hand is saying

451
00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:15.090
this the right hand is
saying that, and there's just

452
00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:18.170
general confusion. You come in
and you're able to, to

453
00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:20.740
a certain extent, almost isolate
all the different voices and

454
00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:23.670
plug what is important to
each one and then synthesize

455
00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:27.030
those and come up with
a plan. That's awesome engineer.

456
00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:30.150
Right. Right. But that, that
is not what I wanted.

457
00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:31.650
You know, that was not
what I envisioned for the

458
00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:34.590
process. For me. It was,
I guess I said a

459
00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:38.010
softer, it's the journey. We're
going to enjoy this. Oh,

460
00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:40.170
wow. We're going to, you
know, sit under this Apple

461
00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:42.180
tree as we bright or
whatever, on a summer day

462
00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:44.820
type of thing Later a
year and a half later

463
00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:50.150
as want to get, like
t-shirts made, we've got five

464
00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:53.930
chapters written, I've got another
seven to do. Right. I'm

465
00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:57.620
thinking in my mind, I'm
just thinking, let's get those

466
00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:01.400
chapters out there. Right. And,
and I would go so

467
00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:04.220
far as to put words
in the listeners, voices at

468
00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:05.840
the ones that are interested
in the book would just

469
00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:09.350
like to see the book,
right. Or we could spend

470
00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:13.430
another year kind of dancing
and a meadow and, and

471
00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:15.980
working on the book, can
we find balance? That's such

472
00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:18.970
a completely different vision. It
is. It is a complete

473
00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:21.190
cause you know, my pushback
to that is, Hey, what

474
00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:26.740
price do you put on
quality? Right. Well, you could

475
00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:32.140
put it here. Yeah. It's
1295 possibly Canadian, but Yeah.

476
00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:34.870
Right. Yeah. So, I mean,
are we writing a book

477
00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:37.750
or not? Right. Is that
a pamphlet for family? And

478
00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:40.270
what's wrong with dancing? The
meadow? I'm just saying Sundance

479
00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:44.590
in the Metro in money.
I don't know. Okay. So

480
00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:47.260
yeah. I could bring in
your listeners back into this.

481
00:24:47.290 --> 00:24:48.820
Yeah, No, but my question
is, how do you rec

482
00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:50.200
how are we going to
reconcile that? That's a great

483
00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:53.620
example of, of, of a
family argument, about a book,

484
00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:58.390
about pause for it, solving
arguments between geeks and regulars.

485
00:24:58.570 --> 00:25:00.370
Well, again, I mean, we
just wrote a chapter of

486
00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:03.310
the book right there. Well,
I mean, and then that's

487
00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:04.870
where you go back again
to benefit of the doubt

488
00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:07.300
working together. We're a team
and communication. I mean, right.

489
00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:09.370
How many times do you
hear this all the time,

490
00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:12.250
you've got to talk to
your partner and know your

491
00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:14.770
audience is what I think.
I said that before, where

492
00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:17.530
I thought I knew what
you wanted. Right. I thought

493
00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:19.750
I knew, I totally thought
I knew you wanted to

494
00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:21.520
write a book. Thanks. Exactly.
So we were both kind

495
00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:23.110
of on the same page,
we both said, Oh, let's

496
00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:25.270
write a book. Yay. You
know, and it just fell

497
00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:27.570
apart after that sentence, the
rest that followed from there

498
00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:29.890
was just completely Because I
was like, okay, we're going

499
00:25:29.890 --> 00:25:31.210
to do it in Mark
down and check it in

500
00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:33.040
to get, and you're like,
wait a second. Does that

501
00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:35.320
work in word? Is that
word? Or what is that?

502
00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:39.580
Yeah. So this is the,
the, the, the, the theory

503
00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:44.080
behind the book is relationships
between regular folks. One of

504
00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:46.570
us is regular and people
who tend to be a

505
00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:50.200
little bit different. Do you
think that I'm different built

506
00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:52.420
in, or do you think
that this is because I'm

507
00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:55.510
an engineer and I've, I've
just done that. I've done

508
00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:58.000
that to myself. Well, probably
a bit of both. Right?

509
00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.610
I mean, how on earth
can one ever figure out

510
00:26:00.610 --> 00:26:04.330
why you are different? You
just have that. You're different

511
00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:06.790
from me. I don't know
which one of us is

512
00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:09.040
different. The point is though
we're different. I think we're

513
00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:11.380
pretty clear on the vineyard.
Here is a different one.

514
00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:14.200
Yeah. See this though, where
we're in a mixed marriage

515
00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:16.270
for a number of reasons
though. Do you think that

516
00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:19.360
the computer person, normal person
thing is a bigger deal

517
00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:24.100
than the cultural coming from
different countries? I would say

518
00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:26.680
in our particular case, you
know, I'm sure it's different

519
00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:29.140
from each couple that is
mixed in for more than

520
00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:32.200
one reason in our particular
case, because you are so

521
00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:36.880
much the engineer just as
who you are. And I

522
00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:39.400
am so much not the
engineer, just as who I

523
00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:41.650
am. I mean, Well, you're
into your, you're very social

524
00:26:41.650 --> 00:26:44.340
and you are the coordinator
and you're the organizer. Right.

525
00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:48.110
But at the emotional level.
Right. Right. And sometimes I

526
00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:51.170
value different things than you
do. You know? I might,

527
00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:52.970
I remember, I think we've
talked about this on one

528
00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:55.070
of your shows before the
first, first time that we

529
00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:59.660
traveled across the country together.
Right. In 2000. Yeah. In

530
00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:01.820
2000, I was, and I'm
not going to go to,

531
00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:03.500
I'm going to, I'm not
going to point out that

532
00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:04.880
you got the year wrong.
I'm going to let that

533
00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:07.370
go. And I was, how
late was I to the

534
00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:10.520
flight? Right? Oh my goodness.
Oh, sweet Lord. Okay. I'm

535
00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:11.990
going to rehash the whole
thing. You know, we have

536
00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:15.680
to rehash the whole thing.
Here we go. So we

537
00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:19.820
were going across the country.
It was going to be

538
00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:22.340
planes, trains, and automobiles. And
our first flight was to

539
00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:25.370
Phoenix and the flight was
at 11. So I got

540
00:27:25.370 --> 00:27:28.490
to the airport at nine.
Right. And the flight was

541
00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:31.010
at 11. And you got
at the airport at 1230.

542
00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:34.160
Right? At which point I
was in a full blown

543
00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:38.200
panic attack, had pulled, I
had pulled the flaw and

544
00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:40.040
this was pre September 11.
So it was a little

545
00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:42.200
more agility that we had.
But I had pulled the

546
00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:44.960
luggage off the flight and
rebooked us on a one

547
00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:48.650
o'clock flight. Right. You showed
up at 1230. Yeah. We

548
00:27:48.650 --> 00:27:53.540
missed the one o'clock flight.
I think we left at

549
00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:57.300
seven. Cause then the flight
after that got canceled. And,

550
00:27:57.470 --> 00:28:00.590
And then it was so
because you didn't show up

551
00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:02.390
for the flight in the
morning and I showed up

552
00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:05.900
two hours early that made
us late, but be me

553
00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:07.850
be showing up early. It
gave us the agility to,

554
00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:11.540
to get the stuff off
the flight. We got there

555
00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:13.610
at like nine o'clock. It
was, it was nighttime. When

556
00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:16.550
we got there, it was
a 12 hour flight to

557
00:28:16.550 --> 00:28:19.820
Phoenix. And then, you know,
for people who don't know

558
00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:21.980
us very well, that just
sounds like, wow, Oh, you

559
00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:24.410
know, that's terrible. Why can't
you keep Tom? Well, what

560
00:28:24.410 --> 00:28:27.740
was I doing? Right? Then
you go back to the

561
00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:30.470
bathroom. You were at work,
you were at work on

562
00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:33.710
your very last day of
work and you wanted to

563
00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:37.490
finish the work completely before
you quit the job. Right.

564
00:28:37.490 --> 00:28:39.800
So my last day of
work was the day before.

565
00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:42.590
And then my boss needed
something done. And she right.

566
00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:44.720
Extra day of work for
free that you gave your

567
00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:47.600
boss Did persist a few
hours. But again, what's, what's

568
00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:49.190
a few hours when you're
supposed to join a plane.

569
00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:52.340
Right. But so for me,
it was, well, I'm going

570
00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:54.380
to be traveling across the
country with Scott. There's no

571
00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:56.960
real agenda. We don't have
any hard goals. We're just

572
00:28:57.020 --> 00:28:59.870
traveling across the country. So
I could give on that

573
00:28:59.870 --> 00:29:01.760
in my mind, as opposed
to this thing that I

574
00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:03.950
knew was important for my
boss, she would appreciate it.

575
00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:06.290
It would make her life
easier after I was gone.

576
00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:08.690
It wasn't much of a
choice for me do the

577
00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:10.970
right thing. And in my
mind call me. So I

578
00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:13.790
sat, did we have cell
phones back then? I don't

579
00:29:13.790 --> 00:29:17.180
know. I'm pretty sure that
this telephone system has been

580
00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:19.230
around longer than. Yeah. I
know for a fact that

581
00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:20.690
I wouldn't have a cell
phone at the time, Of

582
00:29:20.690 --> 00:29:22.790
course, but you could have
figured out some way you

583
00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:26.450
wouldn't, it was 2000 so
dove or some kind of

584
00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:29.720
a yes. A Raven. Right.
So, so coming back to

585
00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:32.300
the point though, about cultural
differences and That was a

586
00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:34.910
work ethics versus being on
time thing. Right. And what

587
00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:36.560
would you have done in
that case? Your boss comes

588
00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:38.540
to you. You've decided, okay,
I'm moving on. But there's

589
00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:40.430
this thing that, you know,
he needs, do you say,

590
00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:42.700
Hey, my time is done
and walk away. Do you

591
00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:44.950
say, Hey, I'll give you
half of what it takes.

592
00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:47.550
I mean, That's a challenge.
That's a challenging thing. I

593
00:29:47.550 --> 00:29:49.590
think what I would have
said, which I'm assuming you

594
00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:52.200
didn't is I would have
said, well, shoot, I have

595
00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:56.070
a flight. I'm not saying
I wouldn't do it. I

596
00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:58.740
would say I have a
flight. And if the boss

597
00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:02.400
said, Oh gosh, could I
pay to have the flight

598
00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:04.140
moved an hour or two?
Or could you move the

599
00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:06.690
hour or two? But you
actually didn't even tell your

600
00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:10.050
boss that you had a
flight. So you actually abstracted

601
00:30:10.050 --> 00:30:12.330
away the fact that you
were going to be late

602
00:30:12.570 --> 00:30:17.070
for your plane, thereby putting
our trip 12 hours late.

603
00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:19.140
Right. And of course, I
didn't know it was gonna

604
00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:21.570
be 12 hours late in
my mind, The result, the

605
00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:26.670
result was a cascading failure,
but I'm less concerned about

606
00:30:26.670 --> 00:30:27.960
that. But the fact that
I was waiting at the

607
00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:31.880
airport, which was no fun,
let's draw it. So the

608
00:30:31.890 --> 00:30:34.920
difference there is that you
swallowed the fact that we

609
00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:36.840
were doing that you hid
that fact from the boss,

610
00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:40.620
which was very noble to
be clear. But you would

611
00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:42.870
say that if I said
to the boss, you know,

612
00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:45.660
I got, I got a
flight, then I'm putting my

613
00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:47.730
burdens onto the boss and
I'm stressing them out with

614
00:30:47.730 --> 00:30:50.340
my personal stuff that the
boss doesn't need, that he

615
00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:52.680
just needs his problem solved.
I mean, I didn't even

616
00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:54.930
think about telling her, you
know, you said, I hid

617
00:30:54.930 --> 00:30:57.090
that from the boss. I
didn't hide it because in

618
00:30:57.090 --> 00:30:59.790
my mind it wasn't even
relevant to the issue. She,

619
00:30:59.850 --> 00:31:02.940
what did she want from
me? She said, can I

620
00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:05.690
do it right? And I
made a judgment, the judgment

621
00:31:05.730 --> 00:31:07.470
call, right? As an adult,
you, you decide and you

622
00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:09.870
suffer the consequences. My thought
was, Oh, it's not that

623
00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:11.580
big a deal. You know,
we don't have a hard

624
00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:13.440
stop anywhere or a hard
start the next day. It's

625
00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:16.590
fine. We're just moving along.
I wish I had known

626
00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:19.680
we'd been nosy. Nobody told
you that you just thought

627
00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:21.980
it was going to be
ruthless efficiency. I would stay

628
00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:24.660
home. And then I would
have come back later. Exactly.

629
00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:27.090
Again, if you had known,
if I had known, I

630
00:31:27.090 --> 00:31:29.790
would have not showed up.
Exactly. And then you do

631
00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:31.980
run into that, you know,
your actions do impact other

632
00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:33.810
people. And what point do
you have to consider the

633
00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:35.850
other person? Because certainly it
was never meant to be

634
00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:38.550
disrespectful to you. Right. So
then you have to rebuild

635
00:31:38.550 --> 00:31:41.550
that marriage anyway. And you've
married me anyway. Oh, you're

636
00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:47.640
a state. Oh, fantastic. Actually
we're at the end. We

637
00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:50.220
have 30, 30 minutes now,
but I did want to

638
00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:54.090
ask one question why I
really like to be at

639
00:31:54.090 --> 00:31:57.000
the airport early. I try
to get there an hour

640
00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.750
or two early. You think
that it's an accomplishment to

641
00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:03.330
put your foot in the
door as they're closing the

642
00:32:03.330 --> 00:32:07.650
door to the, to the
airplane? Yeah. Just one more.

643
00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:10.380
This one more like, that's
like an achievement. You're like

644
00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:13.680
awesome. I didn't wait a
second. Where's that coming from?

645
00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:16.200
And again, I don't know
that this is going to

646
00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:20.880
be relevant to everybody. Look,
my, my take on airports

647
00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:24.030
has been primarily, very sad,
right? For the longest time

648
00:32:24.030 --> 00:32:26.460
I was in the United States
by myself, without my family.

649
00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:29.670
So I associated Edwards with
leaving family. It was not

650
00:32:29.670 --> 00:32:31.740
a place that I think
of fondly and be like,

651
00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:33.690
woo, I'm going to spend
four hours waiting at the

652
00:32:33.690 --> 00:32:36.720
airport. It was almost always
a, I'm saying goodbye to

653
00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:38.850
somebody that I love, that
I care about Wildwood. I

654
00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:41.450
there, I mean, I don't
want to spend a second

655
00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:43.760
longer than I need to.
You know, your, your listeners

656
00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:45.920
will be thrilled to know
that now that we have

657
00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:48.650
kids, I certainly don't do
that least not nearly as

658
00:32:48.650 --> 00:32:50.180
much as I used to
when I was single, because

659
00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:53.390
it's a stressful, my kid.
So, you know, and now

660
00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:55.610
airports mean, you know, half
the time I'll come to

661
00:32:55.610 --> 00:32:57.310
meet you at the airport.
So it's a happier still.

662
00:32:57.310 --> 00:32:59.480
Don't like to go two
hours early though. Come on.

663
00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:02.710
No, I still don't like
that. And you've never told

664
00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:04.330
me that before. I didn't
know that they, you thought

665
00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:06.220
they were sad. You just
thought I was dead. I

666
00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:07.930
just didn't know. I just
thought you liked being late

667
00:33:09.370 --> 00:33:11.800
benefit of the doubt. And
I figured it down. Wow.

668
00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:17.740
The more, you know, this
has been another episode of

669
00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:21.220
Hansel minutes. Thank you. Small
wife, walk up, honey. We'll

670
00:33:21.220 --> 00:33:22.150
see you again next week.
