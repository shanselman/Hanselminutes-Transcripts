Hi, this is Scott Hanselman.

8
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.260
This is another episode of
Hanselminutes today. I've got a

9
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.230
special show for you. I've
got Jessica Rose, who's the host

10
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.800
of the pursuit podcast and
a tech education activist. And

11
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.980
we're trying something new. Jessica
had a great idea that

12
00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.550
we would do a podcasting
crossover show. Thanks for having

13
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.130
that idea and for including,
Oh, I was actually pretty

14
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:05.870
sure it was your idea,
but if we just want

15
00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.870
to go back and forth
and compliment each other, it'll

16
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.300
be different. You should spend
at least 20, 30 minutes

17
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.170
compliment each other. Yeah. So
somehow we spontaneously simultaneously had

18
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.460
this idea and you tweeted
that we would ask people

19
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.720
for what the worst tech
industry advice that they'd ever

20
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.110
received was. And people got
some really horrible advice. People

21
00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.250
are telling tech workers, just
awful things. It's almost like

22
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.460
almost everyone gives that advice.
Yeah. And the funny thing

23
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.400
about advice is that the
greatest advice I ever received

24
00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.820
was that you don't need
to take advice. Oh, I

25
00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.880
always preface when I give
someone advice so well, before

26
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.640
I tell you this, keep
in mind that everybody's just

27
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.400
a big bundle of biases.
And I really think that

28
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.890
when you give someone advice,
most people are just, they're

29
00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.620
not telling you what you
should do. They're telling you

30
00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.290
what they wish they would
do in the same situation

31
00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.560
Or even worse, what they
wish they would have done

32
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.500
in the past. Oh, so
much. All of my advice

33
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.360
is just like, no, go
move to a new country,

34
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.470
start over. Yes. That's interesting.
I'm starting to find, and

35
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.230
I'm not even that old,
but I'm finding my advice

36
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.790
is becoming old man advice,
which is like, Oh, well,

37
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.270
young person. Let me tell
you the vast, the vast

38
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.940
amount of my experience, which
is really not that much

39
00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.010
because there's so many people
that have 20, 30 years

40
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.100
more than I do. And
it doesn't seem to me

41
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.780
that being old necessarily means
being qualified. It just means

42
00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.720
old. I think that you're
maybe in the minority of

43
00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.880
people who like to give
advice, if you're, if you're

44
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.230
smart enough not to connect
experience well, length of time

45
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.720
on the world, in the
world with experience and wisdom.

46
00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.550
Yeah. Well, I think that
I, I may have incorrectly

47
00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.300
believed that there was a
direct correlation, but I started

48
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.710
interacting with people at a
few jobs ago where they

49
00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.920
had 20 years experience, but
then I figured out it

50
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.640
was the same year, 20
times. That's absolutely something I'm

51
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.280
going to steal and drop
into a conversation, sort of

52
00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.320
at the pub as though
I thought of that myself.

53
00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.350
Don't you find that to
be the case though, that,

54
00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.530
I mean, it really is
about growth mindset. I think

55
00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.440
that might be really true.
I I'm always a little

56
00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.950
bit more comfortable critique criticizing
myself than other people. So

57
00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.630
if I was looking back
at my experience and be

58
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.110
like, well, I've got 30
mumble mumble years, but there's

59
00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:29.760
a big chunk of my
twenties. It doesn't count for

60
00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.850
much. Oh, interesting. And why
would you dismiss that part

61
00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.070
of your career? Was it
because you weren't, you know,

62
00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:43.710
your brainstem wasn't attached? That's
my excuse? Well, it's difficult

63
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:45.120
because a lot of the
things I was doing at

64
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.580
the time I was working
in education, I was working

65
00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.430
in a different country and
culture. Some of that was

66
00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.360
really valuable, but sort of
the going to work part,

67
00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.490
like being in an office
when I was working in

68
00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.910
an office overseas, wasn't especially
helpful. I don't feel like

69
00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.160
I got a lot of
that. Hmm. That makes sense.

70
00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:07.170
I didn't feel super amazing
about my work experiences before

71
00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.230
my thirties, because I didn't
feel like I was emotionally

72
00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.960
engaged in the work as
much as maybe I could

73
00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.540
have been. Oh, that's really
interesting as well. I also

74
00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.780
think maybe I'm being a
bit unkind to twenty-something Jess.

75
00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.850
I wonder whether or not
I was just a bit

76
00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.740
of a jerk in my
early twenties and wasn't that

77
00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.490
helpful? Well, I've met a
lot of very nice people

78
00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.900
in their twenties, but I
would have to admit as

79
00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.570
well that I was not
super awesome until I was

80
00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.630
probably in my mid thirties.
But here we are to

81
00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.960
do old people complaining about
young people. I think young

82
00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.990
people do give great advice.
They give great advice now

83
00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.090
because I think they were
paying attention more than perhaps

84
00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.620
we were, I am consistently
impressed and hopeful when I

85
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.480
talk to the younguns. So
we asked folks online to

86
00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.820
give us their worst advice.
And some of them were

87
00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.870
kind enough to send in
actual audio files. So we've

88
00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.940
got some of those audio
files that we'll play. And

89
00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.620
then what we're going to
do is a two part

90
00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.220
show. So sometimes people complain
that my show is too

91
00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.550
short. They say 30 minutes.
Isn't long enough. So this

92
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.500
is part one. And then
we're going to have you

93
00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:16.170
go over to pursuit.tech. HDDP
whack whack pursuit dot T

94
00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:19.530
E C H, and listen
to part two on Jessica's

95
00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.500
podcast, which is I think
a great idea. And I'm

96
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.750
going to be airing this
tomorrow. So you've got a

97
00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:28.470
whole day to wait until
you get more delicious. Yeah,

98
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:33.030
absolutely. So we have folks
from Twitter and the internets

99
00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:36.330
who have made us wave
files and a flat files

100
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.570
of their bad advice. And
we'll play a few on

101
00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:41.220
my show and we'll play
a few on your show,

102
00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.770
your show, and we will
discuss them. So I've got

103
00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.230
a couple of different folks
here that responded and we

104
00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.900
thank them very much for
letting us use their, their

105
00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.170
audio files. The first one
I've got here was from

106
00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.550
Don <inaudible> and I'm going
to play that right now.

107
00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:04.330
If that's okay. Industry advice
I've received was people seem

108
00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.850
to believe what you tell
them. You should work in

109
00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:12.250
sales. This was after a
project where we had done

110
00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:18.340
some deep user research and
produced a supporting interactive prototype

111
00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:23.620
to prove a hypothesis. Okay.
So that was not very

112
00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.840
kind or helpful advice. What
did you think about that?

113
00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.200
Am I allowed to swear?
I would rather that you

114
00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:35.140
not work blue. Oh my,
you would believe the actual

115
00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:38.710
goal to be like, Oh,
hi, Don, Don, completely ignoring

116
00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:40.870
the hard work she put
in all of her research.

117
00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.730
The fact that she's a
skilled professional, be like, Oh

118
00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:46.840
wow. Peop people seem to
believe what you're saying. Yeah.

119
00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:50.610
I've actually had another person
at th that I worked

120
00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:54.520
with at Microsoft. Someone said
that people believe what you

121
00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:58.330
say, and you look like
a sales person and there

122
00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:02.410
are you wearing like a
polo. It wasn't me. But

123
00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:04.720
it was an actually a
very, a very stylist, young,

124
00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.440
new Yorker who, who is
into fashion and also a

125
00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:14.230
talented technologist. And apparently looking
put together or looking in

126
00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:18.100
some way competent, you know,
from a fashion perspective immediately

127
00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:20.110
means that you should be
in sales, which I think

128
00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:25.660
is really bad advice. Was
this another female technologist? She

129
00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:29.080
did happen to be a
female technologist. I it's interesting

130
00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:31.240
New York, you know, you've probably,
you spent some time in

131
00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:34.270
New York as I have. It
has more fashionable people in

132
00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:37.930
my experience than the West
coast does particularly Manhattan proper.

133
00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:41.290
And there seems to be
a uniform. You know, the

134
00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:43.840
people that I worked with
in New York who wore suits,

135
00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:47.890
if they were men, they
were in finance. And, but

136
00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:50.980
here's a technologist who is
fashionable, a fashionable young woman

137
00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:55.450
and a programmer. They put
her right into a box.

138
00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:00.220
Yeah. I found that a
couple of times at conferences.

139
00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:02.890
So I like to, I've
got the job I want.

140
00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:04.360
So I don't dress for
the job I want, but

141
00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.580
I dress for, if someone's
taking my picture that I

142
00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:10.810
don't feel bad about it
in five years, That's actually

143
00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:13.870
very good advice. But a
lot of times, if I

144
00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:15.700
put on a very nice
dress at an event, I've

145
00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:17.470
had people come up and
be like, Oh, hi, where's

146
00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:20.590
your booth? Where can I
do? It's like, no, no.

147
00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:25.360
So I wonder if there's
not sort of some kind

148
00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.060
of desire. It'd be like,
Oh, you're dressed really, really

149
00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:31.300
well. Miss clearly you're in
sales or in some kind

150
00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:35.020
of nontechnical role. Cause you're
not slouchy enough. I'm trying

151
00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:37.000
to remember the last time
I went to a conference

152
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.860
and saw a, a man
dressed full on suit and

153
00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:45.520
tie, like going to a
wedding type level of, or

154
00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:48.190
you know, going to a
fashion show and it's been

155
00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:51.640
some time, but I would
admit that I just would

156
00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:54.310
think that they were a
fashionable young young man. I

157
00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:58.050
wouldn't necessarily assume that they
were sales. But if I

158
00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:02.850
saw a fashionable young woman,
I might internally think marketing,

159
00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:05.220
which is, which is my
own personal flaw. I would

160
00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:08.300
think, I think that might,
I don't want to explain

161
00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:11.390
what happened in Dawn's case
because really it's just white

162
00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:18.470
hot rage, but how she
managed to hear this and

163
00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:21.410
I assume respond politely and
not punch someone in the

164
00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:27.650
face. Like, wow, not only
accomplished and skilled. And for

165
00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:31.790
some reason people believe her,
but also the incredible restraint.

166
00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:35.990
I think that having restraint
though, is a big part

167
00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:38.930
of being a technologist at
this point, right? There's so

168
00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:42.200
many people that are jockeying
for position that are assuming

169
00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.450
that you either know, or
don't know what you're talking

170
00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:48.140
about. There's a, it feels
like interactions in tech for

171
00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:51.680
all. People are just a
thumb war of who's on

172
00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:55.490
top, as we struggle to
communicate effectively with each other

173
00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:01.130
and just how exhausting it
is exhausting. And I would

174
00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:04.670
say, even, even though there's
a lot of discussion around,

175
00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:09.140
you know, the term mansplaining
and how men interact with

176
00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:13.160
women, there is difficult interactions
with all kinds of personalities,

177
00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:17.900
older man to younger man,
a technical person to non

178
00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:21.290
technical person or vice president,
or, you know, super high

179
00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:25.490
up nontechnical person who controls
your job. It seems like

180
00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:28.700
communication is as much what
technology is about as it

181
00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:32.120
is about writing the code.
Right. I'm super into this

182
00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:34.910
Congress. Not that I wasn't
before, but super into this

183
00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:38.000
conversation before I got into
tech, I was a teacher,

184
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.650
but I was a language
teacher in linguist. So yeah,

185
00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:45.950
positional language, the way we
communicate with each other and

186
00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:49.520
when it is either hierarchical
or largely based on gender

187
00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:53.390
or position or race, it's
also interesting and also messy.

188
00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:00.650
Yeah. Without diving deeper into
it. It's complicated discourse analysis

189
00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:04.730
is something I think technologists
would be really into. And

190
00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:09.440
so sort of looking at
conversations and looking at language

191
00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:13.490
as though it's a pile
of data to pick apart.

192
00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:16.790
It's really fun. Well, if
you don't mind, let's dive

193
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:18.860
a little bit into that
because I think that's valuable.

194
00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:20.960
There might be someone who
is listening to this show

195
00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:26.150
who might, let's just say
dismiss or downplay or minimize

196
00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:28.430
what Don felt and say,
Oh, well that was just

197
00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:31.100
a compliment. Don could simply
say, Oh, well thank you.

198
00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.170
But I'm not in sales.
I'm a technologist. And I

199
00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:37.100
liked my job, no disrespect
to salespeople and then move

200
00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:40.520
on. How do we, you
know, why do some people

201
00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:42.410
take things like that and
say, Oh, I'm going to

202
00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:45.050
be filled with white hot
rage while someone else might

203
00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:47.240
say, Oh, you know, well,
that's, that's your, that's your

204
00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:50.210
opinion. Thank you. But no,
thank you. So I think

205
00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:53.380
the big one is just
the frequency with which get

206
00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:56.350
those messages. So while it
might sound like a compliment,

207
00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:59.770
like, Hey, wow, completely ignoring
the work you've put in

208
00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:02.920
these people believe you like
first off. Why would that,

209
00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:06.130
why would that be a
surprise? Why are you telling

210
00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:09.360
me that? That's very strange,
Interesting. That's like, Oh, your

211
00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:12.750
code compiled. Isn't that nice
for you? Well, good, good

212
00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:16.020
job. You're you're, you've met
the baseline for competence, have

213
00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:19.980
a cookie. And following that
up with, Hey, why don't

214
00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:24.450
you work in this job?
Which while it's skilled has

215
00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:28.170
a different skill set and
has, is often not given

216
00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:30.960
the amount of respect and
which is a separate issue

217
00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:32.820
and something I also think
needs to be looked at,

218
00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:35.070
but it's not really given
the same amount of respect

219
00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:38.340
or looked at the same
Mount with prestige as the

220
00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:43.050
technical role. Don occupies. No,
that's another interest. That's an

221
00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:45.810
interesting point. Let's pick that
apart for a second, because

222
00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:51.780
like, there are those that
believe that the word politically

223
00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:56.370
correct means to, you know,
to be overly, you know,

224
00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:58.920
dancing around words. Like it
seems like, it seems like

225
00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:01.320
I might be right now,
but it all other people

226
00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:04.020
say being politically correct is
to simply be kind to

227
00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:05.520
other humans and treat them
the way that they would

228
00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:08.490
like to be treated. So
when you say that, my

229
00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:10.380
first impression is like, well,
I don't want to downplay

230
00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:12.600
sales because I know sales
is nothing that I could

231
00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:17.610
do. Like I work with
salespeople that had that magic,

232
00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:22.080
whatever that I did not
have and I do not

233
00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:24.330
have, and I'll never understand
it. It is, it is

234
00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:28.350
black magic as far as
I'm concerned, sales is. But

235
00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:31.830
I can admit though, to
feeling that same way, that

236
00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:34.440
if you tell someone who
is highly technical, that they

237
00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:37.320
should be something that is
perceived as not highly technical,

238
00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:39.960
they'll immediately kind of like
recoil and like, eh, no,

239
00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:42.960
I, you know, it's like
saying to a, to a

240
00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:45.570
surgeon, you know, you should
probably be the front desk

241
00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:50.160
person that takes people's information
because you're so nice When

242
00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:51.870
you were saying this. I
was actually thinking about a

243
00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:54.480
dear friend of mine who
is an orthopedic surgeon. Oh

244
00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:57.780
wow. And she's tiny and
cute and just an absolute

245
00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:00.930
joy and smarter than definitely
smarter than me. I don't

246
00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:04.170
want to say smarter than
most people. I know, but

247
00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:07.530
she's an orthopedic surgeon, which
has lots of I'm going

248
00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:13.470
to get this wrong, but
clenching together, big boats. Yeah.

249
00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:16.620
I mean, I think it's
joints and bits right. Of

250
00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:20.400
hips apparently like, please, please
salt your salt, your driveways.

251
00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:26.190
But because she's, she's warmed.
Well, I don't mean to

252
00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:30.300
ascribe motives for some reason,
whatever reason, lots of times

253
00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:32.130
on her way in and
out of work in medical

254
00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:35.040
settings, people say, Oh wow.
Because she looks quite young

255
00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:37.860
as well. Oh, you should
absolutely get into medicine. Oh,

256
00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:41.190
have you thought of becoming
a nurse on a good

257
00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:43.620
day? Be like, Oh, you'd
be such a great pediatrician.

258
00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:48.720
Oh, well see the nurse
one I could see because

259
00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:51.210
it says it's an implied,
it's kind of a diminutive,

260
00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:54.530
but the be a pediatrician,
one that one kind of

261
00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:56.660
gets into a gray area
where they're basically saying you're

262
00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:59.360
so nice. Here's a place
where we need more nice

263
00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:03.400
people. I wonder if that's
what they're saying though. I

264
00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:07.960
think it's young lady. Oh
dear. You should ascribe to

265
00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:11.650
a medical profession someday. What
about these two commonly accepted

266
00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:16.060
paths? You seem like you
fit in here. Let's put

267
00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:20.140
you someplace that I imagine
where you fit. Interesting. So

268
00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:23.020
that brings up, I think
the root of this advice

269
00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:26.650
and why we think that
was lousy advice is we

270
00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:30.400
should avoid trying to put
people into a slot. We

271
00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:33.280
should let people find their
own slot. Well, I think

272
00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:35.470
that if I could, was
this a bit meta? If

273
00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:38.530
I can give advice on
a show about giving advice,

274
00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:43.540
mine to you, dear listener
would be that if you're

275
00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:47.380
in a technical space, just
assume everyone there is technical.

276
00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:51.760
Like sometimes you're going to
be wrong, but nobody's going

277
00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:55.240
to get that grumpy about
it. That is fantastic advice

278
00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:58.300
that mirrors some advice that
I recently gave someone at

279
00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:02.350
a tech conference where I
said, assume that whoever you're

280
00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:05.500
talking to at the booth
is the CTO until they

281
00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:08.950
tell you that they're not
One thing I also really

282
00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:13.090
enjoyed from teaching. So the
great thing about teaching is

283
00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:15.010
you get a lot of
applicable skills to carry with

284
00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:18.100
you. So in teaching you
get told again and again,

285
00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:21.130
don't ask yes or no
questions to check for understanding,

286
00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:24.250
because if I say it
to you like, Oh, here's

287
00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:26.140
this thing, it does this.
It does that. Do you

288
00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:30.720
understand 90% of the time
just out of social convention,

289
00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:33.010
I'm gonna say yes. I
don't want to sound dumb.

290
00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:37.930
Yes. I understand. Whereas if
you want to actually tack

291
00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:41.110
for comprehension and especially if
you're talking to someone in

292
00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:43.210
a technical space and you
don't know what they do,

293
00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:46.750
you don't know their background.
Don't say, do you understand

294
00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:51.010
this? Or, but actually ask,
so, Oh, Hey, do you

295
00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:54.730
know what I'm working on
this new project? What kind

296
00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:58.660
of experience do you have
with react? People might say

297
00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:01.270
none, but that still lets
them opt in or out.

298
00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:07.300
That is a really good
and very concrete. Something that

299
00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:10.030
we can all apply like
today at work, we can

300
00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:12.580
stop this podcast. And the
next time we have an

301
00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:15.700
interaction with someone, do you
understand this? Yes or no

302
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.260
very bad, but to ask
for, I love that I'm

303
00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.630
going to really put that
together. That's very helpful. Thank

304
00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:25.270
you. Well, I've really enjoyed
it because a lot of

305
00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:27.730
times I don't expect someone
has a lot of experience

306
00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:29.980
with this or that. And
asking that question, like what

307
00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:32.320
kind of experience you have
with front end web work,

308
00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:35.230
unexpected people will just pop
out and say like, Oh,

309
00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:37.300
I actually did these courses
or, well, you know, I

310
00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:38.680
used to work as a
web dev back in the

311
00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:42.820
day. Mm. Or of course
with the people on the

312
00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:44.680
internet that you interact with,
you might just have them

313
00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:48.010
say, Oh yeah, I invented
that. Yeah, that I am

314
00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:51.360
the creator, But I think
we might have one or

315
00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:56.030
two more clips. So folks
getting terrible advice. Yes. So

316
00:17:56.030 --> 00:17:58.970
the next one is Haley
Anderson and thank you, Hailey,

317
00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:02.780
for letting us use your
horrible industry advice. Let's see

318
00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:06.290
what folks said to Haley
I'm Haley Anderson. And the

319
00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:08.720
worst industry advice I got
was asked for a lower

320
00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:11.600
salary from at least three
different career advisors and a

321
00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:15.470
couple of recruiters each time
and still got that salary.

322
00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:18.920
And later found out I
was underpaid, Asking for a

323
00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:22.040
lower salary. I have heard
people give that advice before

324
00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:25.280
and I've never quite understood
it. Why would you downplay

325
00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:29.000
yourself? Are you trying not
to offend an organization? I,

326
00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:33.560
I was absolutely baffled when
I heard this advice and

327
00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:37.340
I don't know if there's
a wonder description for like

328
00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:41.480
confused and angry that I
was that. And I do

329
00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:43.970
a lot of one-on-one work
with people getting to technology

330
00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:46.760
and junior technologists. And this
is advice. Tons of people

331
00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:52.490
get, I feel like sometimes
when I was getting started,

332
00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:55.550
people would tell me to
ask for a lower salary

333
00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:59.660
so that less would be
expected of me, but it

334
00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:02.390
still doesn't justify. Like I
know I still don't get

335
00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:05.390
to the, I was going
to say in my experience,

336
00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:08.660
I have found the less
people pay you the less

337
00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:15.470
they respect your value. So
coming on board, when I

338
00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:19.160
was freelancing, when I was
doing some consulting work, when

339
00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:21.650
I low-balled a pitch, or
when I, when I delivered

340
00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:25.580
a really, really modest quote,
I found that people were

341
00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:29.060
less likely to pick it
up because it looked less

342
00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:31.580
valuable. But also when they
did pick me, pick up

343
00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:33.890
some work, that they were
a lot less likely to

344
00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:38.120
take on my advice and
getting paid a little bit

345
00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:41.360
more, which is just glorious
for lots of reasons. I

346
00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.790
could say to someone, well,
you're paying me this amount

347
00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:45.860
of money for this advice.
You don't have to take

348
00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:49.940
it, but that's some money.
Do you believe that it's

349
00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:52.880
true. That if someone comes
in at a certain level,

350
00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:55.520
at a job at a
technical job, that it makes

351
00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:57.590
it that much harder for
them to get like a

352
00:19:57.590 --> 00:20:00.110
correction. Like if they start
behind, they'll always be behind.

353
00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:05.930
I think it depends on
their comfort with lying and,

354
00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:09.140
and people in this situation
should absolutely be willing and

355
00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:13.070
able to lie real God
yet. Lie about your salaries.

356
00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:16.250
The advice is this good
advice or not? How do

357
00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:17.810
I feel about this advice
you're giving them? Well, I

358
00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:22.040
usually don't give this advice
on the air. Why should

359
00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:23.780
we lie? And what do
you mean by you've been

360
00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:28.370
chronically underpaid and someone comes
in and asks in a

361
00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:31.190
new, in a new potential
role. Oh, what are you

362
00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:34.100
getting paid? Don't directly lie.
Don't say I was making

363
00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:38.930
60,000 a year. Let's say
euros, don't say, Oh, I

364
00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:41.990
was making 60,000 euros. You
don't want to lie directly

365
00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:44.390
that you can say like,
well, you know, for a

366
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:48.460
role like this, I'm looking
in the neighborhood of 65

367
00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:51.980
to 70,000. Oh, I see.
So you're saying avoid that,

368
00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:54.630
that direct. How much were
you making so that because

369
00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:56.310
they are asking, how much
were you making so that

370
00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:59.040
they can pay you the
same amount or slightly, slightly

371
00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:02.250
more? Yeah. I, I would
say that if they press

372
00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:05.700
you use your good judgment,
but still sometimes lie, the

373
00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:09.840
things I'm comfortable with people
lying about their salary history,

374
00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:13.740
feel free to inflate that
I think almost everyone does.

375
00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:17.040
If you take time out
to have a kid or

376
00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:20.430
for family reasons, make sure
you're doing a little bit

377
00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:23.130
of paid or unpaid contract
work around that. And then

378
00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:25.620
just go ahead and say,
I took some time off

379
00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:30.450
to, to do some freelance
work. I gently encourage people

380
00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:33.240
to lie when they want
to, to stretch the truth,

381
00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:39.420
if there's a social cost.
So if you've been traditionally

382
00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:44.970
underpaid, especially from, if you're
from an underrepresented group broadcasting,

383
00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:47.460
I was making this much.
Here's how I was being

384
00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:51.360
held back. Just encourages people
to, like you said, create

385
00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:56.730
a cycle where they perpetuate
that. The, the one about

386
00:21:56.730 --> 00:21:59.880
I took time off has,
is a definite challenge. I've

387
00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:03.120
seen people take time off
to have kids. My wife

388
00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:06.090
took time off to have
kids and paid the price

389
00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:10.260
for that. And then if
one takes time off to,

390
00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:13.230
for lack of a better
word, find themselves, that seems

391
00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:16.440
to be, at least in
America found upon like taking

392
00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:19.140
time off for a, what
I would call a mental

393
00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:22.830
health break. Like I needed
six months off or whatever

394
00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:25.590
in, in, in, in the
U S is very much

395
00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:28.620
frowned upon and people will
think you're a foolish for

396
00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:30.360
doing that. And then you'll
pay the price and you'll

397
00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:32.670
never catch up. Well, the
cool thing is we have

398
00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:36.450
tons and tons of data
around this, like folks who

399
00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:40.230
do organizational studies, folks who
work in management studies. We

400
00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:42.990
have a lot of data
about what taking time off

401
00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:46.260
to have a kid or
to go back to school

402
00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:48.420
or to write a book.
We know what kind of

403
00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:52.350
costs these have when I
encourage people to stretch the

404
00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:54.510
truth around that or to,
to make sure they're doing

405
00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:57.870
a little bit of contracting
to say that instead of

406
00:22:57.870 --> 00:23:02.040
I had a baby, I'm
really mostly concerned about women.

407
00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:05.340
Who've taken time off for
family reasons. Cause they do

408
00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:07.410
tend to get punished for
that quite a bit more.

409
00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:11.730
Yeah. Well, my wife did
some volunteer work and the

410
00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:15.990
intent here is to avoid
large gaps or large unexplainable

411
00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:21.090
gaps where someone sees clearly
on your resume April, 2017 to

412
00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:26.250
March, 2015, nothing. Yeah. And I
always try and remind people

413
00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:29.070
that if you're doing unpaid
work, if you're volunteering, if

414
00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:32.280
you're helping people with stuff,
if you're doing web design

415
00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:36.360
for your friends, unpaid work
is still work. That is,

416
00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:38.040
It was good advice. I
think that that is a

417
00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:40.740
really good reminder. Even if
you're working on your church's

418
00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:45.000
website, all of those things
can be expressed for lack

419
00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:48.170
a better word, even spun
as work. Cause it was,

420
00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:51.280
I say, lie. That sounds
very serious. I'd say go

421
00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:55.240
ahead and put your best
foot forward and make sure

422
00:23:55.240 --> 00:24:00.250
that yeah, well like lots
of times employers, aren't always

423
00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:03.370
as direct and honest with
you as a potential applicant

424
00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:06.400
or a potential employee. And
you kind of expect that

425
00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:10.210
on some level, nobody's going
to say, Oh wow, we've

426
00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:13.660
got a lot of financial
problems right now. So we're

427
00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:16.420
really going to low ball
you on the salary. You

428
00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:18.730
know, that one is, that
is so interesting. I had

429
00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:21.220
someone reach out to me
recently because they were going

430
00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:23.680
to take a job at
a large company. They had

431
00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:27.700
10 years in the business
and they wanted the title

432
00:24:27.790 --> 00:24:32.050
senior and the company was
giving them an offer that

433
00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:36.790
was one notch below senior.
And that it was, they

434
00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:40.090
took it as a kind
of a personal affront. And

435
00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:42.790
in digging around, it turned
out that that was a

436
00:24:42.790 --> 00:24:45.880
standard thing that that company
did to allow people to

437
00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:47.860
hit the ground running. And
then they promote you to

438
00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:51.190
senior within six months or
a year. But that wasn't

439
00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:54.310
information that the person was
able to receive from the

440
00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:57.520
recruiter that was inside industry
information, that they had to

441
00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:59.890
go and dig out from
a person on the inside.

442
00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:03.760
Had they not known that
they would have simply left

443
00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:06.610
the, the offer and said,
Oh, well forget you people.

444
00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:11.260
Maybe, maybe I'm a suspicious
old lady and a little

445
00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:14.320
bit suspicious of companies where
they're like, Hey, come on

446
00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:15.910
in on these terms. And
then, you know what? We

447
00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:18.190
absolutely swear in six months
we will sort you out

448
00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:21.640
and we'll do right by
you. Yeah. Yeah. Unless it's

449
00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:25.810
on paper, it probably never
happened. Wouldn't you say, Get

450
00:25:25.810 --> 00:25:27.850
everything in paper. And even
when you've got it in

451
00:25:27.850 --> 00:25:33.280
paper, go in with some
gentle trepidation, coupled with your

452
00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:37.270
hope By trepidation, you mean
a healthy dose of skepticism

453
00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:42.640
and suspicion just to touch.
I think that's good advice.

454
00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:45.490
So I'm hearing us say
that we want to help

455
00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:49.420
people avoid getting into slots.
Whether that slot be like

456
00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:51.580
Dawn, where someone in one
of them to be in

457
00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:54.850
sales, even though that was
not appropriate or with someone

458
00:25:54.850 --> 00:25:57.900
like Haley, someone was gently
nudging them towards a, a

459
00:25:57.930 --> 00:26:01.510
lower paid job, maybe a
junior position. Well like don't

460
00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:04.870
take advice from people who
can't recognize or don't value

461
00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:11.650
your skillset with Don. The
only thing, the advice givers

462
00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:14.650
heard, the only thing they
could process was wow. People

463
00:26:14.650 --> 00:26:17.500
believe you. They weren't able
to see the full body

464
00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:20.800
of her work, her knowledge
and her experience. And with

465
00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:24.400
Hayley, they just could not
appropriately value her skills in

466
00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:26.950
the workplace. Oh, just ask
for a bit less. It'll

467
00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:30.850
be fine. Who do you
think we should ask advice

468
00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:33.400
of? Because I feel like
sometimes if you had asked

469
00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:36.910
advice of your family, they
are too close, but if

470
00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:40.390
you ask advice of acquaintances
or God forbid the random

471
00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:44.160
internet, not the internet, they're
too far, some, what is

472
00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:48.560
the ideal sweet spot for
advice asking? So I always

473
00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:51.890
like to ask, at least
three people hit something important

474
00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:56.840
and I try and ask
people who have backgrounds somewhat

475
00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:59.660
similar to mine if possible.
And this gets a lot

476
00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:02.840
more difficult if you're from
a group traditionally underrepresented in

477
00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:06.020
tech and doubly hard again,
if you're from one of

478
00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:08.960
these groups and you're in
a really special niche, like

479
00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:12.140
you might be the only
person very much like you

480
00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:16.280
in this space. Yeah. That
is a very good point.

481
00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:19.910
I think that if you
can find those people, you

482
00:27:19.910 --> 00:27:22.040
should hold onto them and
that you should make them

483
00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:24.740
a part of your street
team or your, your personal

484
00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:29.540
board of directors. Yeah. And
if there's very few of

485
00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:31.520
you in that space, supporting
each other is going to

486
00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:36.410
be even more valuable. Definitely.
I wrote a blog post

487
00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:38.540
a while back. I made
a website to support it

488
00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:42.080
called life's board of directors.
And I commented how people

489
00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:44.180
will take the time to
sit down and write a

490
00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:47.480
business plan for their business
or their startup. But so

491
00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:49.430
rarely do we sit down
and write a business plan

492
00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:52.790
for ourselves and our personal
career and even less likely

493
00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:55.070
are we to make a
board of directors to support

494
00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:59.090
that, that venture. But if
you are a venture, why

495
00:27:59.090 --> 00:28:01.010
shouldn't you have a board
of director of supporting you?

496
00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:04.430
I think that's a really
like really, really lovely way

497
00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:07.820
to look at it as
well. I always try and

498
00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:10.760
remind people that when you're
asking for advice, make sure

499
00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:12.860
that you have someone to
go to or make sure

500
00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:16.850
you have perspectives outside your
company. And so when I

501
00:28:16.850 --> 00:28:19.370
manage people, I, especially junior
people, I always like to

502
00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:22.610
ask, okay, do you have
someone else, someone external to

503
00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:25.820
the company? Who's not necessarily
a formal mentor, but someone

504
00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:27.740
who could give you advice,
someone you can run things

505
00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:33.560
past and nobody's completely disinterested,
but trying to find people

506
00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:36.680
who have as much of
your best interest at heart.

507
00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:40.670
Yeah. With as few conflict
as interests as possible is

508
00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:43.970
always a nice idea. True.
Very true. So that is

509
00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:46.940
going to be the end
of part, one of our

510
00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:50.720
worst advice, a show series
we're going to then ask

511
00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:53.630
you now tomorrow or today,
if it's, if it's the

512
00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:57.650
future to go over to
pursuit.tech, P U R S

513
00:28:57.650 --> 00:29:00.680
U I T dot T
C H and listen to

514
00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:04.190
Jessica and I on part
two on the pursuit podcast.

515
00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:07.820
Thanks so much for having
this idea, Jessica. Oh, thank

516
00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:11.180
you so much for having
this idea. This has been

517
00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:13.730
another episode of Hansel minutes
and we'll see you again

518
00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:14.270
next week.
