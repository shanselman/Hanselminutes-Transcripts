relationship and how to get
the most out of your

11
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:04.370
interns. Hi, this is Scott
Hanselman. This is another episode

12
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.130
of Hansel minutes. And today
I've got Ben Caymans who

13
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.140
is a lead developer at
the Khan Academy and was

14
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.530
also a part of the
storied fog Creek software. And

15
00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.360
he's on the phone right
now. How's it going, Ben?

16
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.000
Hey, it's going pretty well.
How about you? Very, very

17
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.610
well. Thanks for chatting with
me today. I heard that

18
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.320
your summer interns are starting
to show up. Yeah, they

19
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.560
are. We're getting a packed
house here. We've got 15

20
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.690
on the way and that
number keeps it's grown since

21
00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.520
I blogged. So I can
never seem to quite get

22
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.320
a ride, but I counted
last night and it's 15.

23
00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.070
So how, how are you
going to keep from being

24
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.020
completely overwhelmed? Because that's like
15 new employees basically just

25
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.350
rolling in. Yeah, it is
pretty nuts. I mean, I

26
00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:46.940
guess that number is not
so big for a real

27
00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.730
company like Microsoft, but for
us, it's basically a one

28
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:54.080
to one ratio between full
time developers and interns. And

29
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.070
so it involves a fair
amount of preparation and planning

30
00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.480
and really just acknowledgement that
we view the internship program

31
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.410
as extremely important and we're
willing to sacrifice time. So

32
00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.590
I guess part of the
key to not losing a

33
00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.830
whole bunch of time productivity
is just acknowledging that you

34
00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.290
will lose some and that's
okay. And in the long

35
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.130
run, things will come out.
All right. I remember when

36
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.390
I had interns, there were
times, and I it's bad

37
00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.490
to say this kind of
out loud, but there were

38
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.120
times when I was just
like, you know, I don't

39
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.270
need an intern right now.
I just don't need this,

40
00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.980
like this little person. Who's
not a full time developer.

41
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.580
She's going, you know what
I mean? Cause you're just

42
00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.440
so focused on what you're
doing and now you've got

43
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.170
a person that you have
to, and they're really competent

44
00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.170
once you get them rolling,
but they're not full time

45
00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.500
employees by their nature. They
are interns. So they don't

46
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.510
know as much as someone
you hired. Yeah. You know,

47
00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.890
it's, it's true. There's definitely,
it definitely takes a conscious

48
00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.020
effort to not get frustrated
sometimes when, you know, whenever

49
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.150
you're onboarding somebody new, I
always kind of remind myself

50
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.720
of something that's unfortunately burned
into my mind when I

51
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.750
was an intern at fog
Creek and my friend Brett

52
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.530
was kind of my mentor.
And I still remember, I

53
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.960
still remember the commands. I
was typing on the command

54
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.000
line as he was sitting
down behind me. And it

55
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.770
wasn't until a few days
after I was typing those

56
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.210
commands. And I knew he
was watching me that I

57
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.270
realized that they were completely
nonsensical. You know, I won't

58
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.940
get into the full details
other than I remember. I

59
00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.160
mean, it had something to
do with the commands PHP

60
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.050
and curl being typed in
a way that would make

61
00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.870
absolutely no sense whatsoever to
people who understood what those

62
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.980
were doing. And I, I
always remember that Brett never,

63
00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.070
you know, he could have
really quickly kind of told

64
00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:46.870
me the exact right thing
to write or he just

65
00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.390
could've gotten frustrated. Maybe he
was rolling his eyes. I

66
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.670
don't know, but he kinda
just sat behind me and

67
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.440
helped me understand what was
going on and took his

68
00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.350
time, even though I wasn't
a full time employee yet.

69
00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.260
And he, you know, he,
he immediately took the long

70
00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.020
view of helping me out.
And so that, that was

71
00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.330
always important to me after,
and it was always an

72
00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.030
embarrassing thing to think of,
but you know, that had

73
00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.650
an effect on me. So
I try to remember that

74
00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.410
and, you know, try to
give, try to give other

75
00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.730
interns the same, the same
amount of respect. So what

76
00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.920
kind of overhead do you
expect? I mean, if you're

77
00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.080
going to have a one
to one relationship and presumably

78
00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:21.300
you'll, you'll have one, or
maybe even two kind of

79
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.480
assigned to you, are you
going to just assume half

80
00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.340
of your time or quarter
time, is there a rule

81
00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.760
of thumb? What we tried,
what we try to do

82
00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.210
is make sure that every
individual full time or has

83
00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.660
at most two interns and,
you know, as you start

84
00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.490
to get to three, then
you're right. Then it starts

85
00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.950
to take up half, three
quarters of your time with

86
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.500
two interns. If you're all
working on the same project,

87
00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.280
it feels like, you know,
maybe a quarter, maybe 30,

88
00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.400
40% of your time can
be spent working directly with

89
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.800
interns. It'll obviously be a
little higher for the first

90
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.010
week or so. But after
that, I, you know, I've

91
00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.810
found that I found that
maybe a third of your

92
00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.600
time spent with two interns
as well worth it. Right?

93
00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.760
So that's a, that's a
lot of productivity if you're

94
00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.620
used to being a heads
down programmer, but you were

95
00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.740
saying that having these extra
bodies, even for as much

96
00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.320
of a third of your
time as overhead is, is

97
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.130
a valuable thing. Yeah, so
far. Absolutely. And we give

98
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.740
developers a choice, obviously, if
somebody wants to stay head

99
00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.730
down and they don't have
to mentor interns, but it

100
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.770
can be really rewarding. And
we've found that if you

101
00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.410
prepare, if you prepare your
product and your vision for

102
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.430
your product enough before the
summer rolls around. I remember

103
00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.250
I remember the summers, every
internship summer, I've been a

104
00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.440
part of as being the
most productive in terms of

105
00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:35.910
things that we should, the
amount of code that we

106
00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.790
ship. It takes a lot
of effort to not just

107
00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:41.280
let code kind of go
nuts. And lots of new

108
00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.710
features show up that are
not code reviewed or, and

109
00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.930
things like that. It takes
practice in terms of how

110
00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:50.010
you manage the relationship. But
certainly I think when interns

111
00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.200
leave, it feels like the
sales kind of deflated in

112
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:57.290
terms of productivity at the
end of every summer intern

113
00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.760
rolls in to Con may
you have a new you

114
00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:02.210
in a New York office? Is
that right? Or where are

115
00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:05.390
you located now? We're actually
in mountain view all your

116
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:08.110
mountain view now. So you
moved. Yeah. I moved to

117
00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:11.230
fog Creek was New York and
not on California. Oh, rock

118
00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:13.750
on. Okay. So you've got
an office in mountain view

119
00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.390
and a bunch of people
start showing up and it's

120
00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:18.820
their first day and you
shake their hand and then

121
00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:22.690
what happens? Yeah. So, well,
it really, the first thing

122
00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:26.470
that happens is we make
sure that a individual full

123
00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:28.810
time mentor will go up
to the intern, shake their

124
00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:31.390
hand, tell them how thrilled
we are to have them

125
00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:34.900
here and tell them that
there is a, that they

126
00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.300
are their explicit mentors for
at least the beginning of

127
00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.570
the summer. And what that
means is that they can

128
00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:43.540
ask the intern can ask
their mentor anything, you know,

129
00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:46.120
where's the bathroom, or I
need a new keyboard. I

130
00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:48.970
like typing on a better
keyboard and obviously all types

131
00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:51.880
of technical questions and an
interim shouldn't have to be

132
00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:54.460
self conscious about any of
that stuff at the start.

133
00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:57.460
We, we think it's much
easier to fix the problem

134
00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:00.580
of an intern asking too
many questions than to have

135
00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:03.580
somebody sitting there banging their
head against problems because they

136
00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:05.530
don't, they're too embarrassed to
ask anybody and they're not

137
00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:07.960
getting anything done. So really
the first thing that happened

138
00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.380
is we just kind of
set up a balanced relationship

139
00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:13.360
between intern and mentor and
make sure that they're not,

140
00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:18.160
self-conscious asking for help. I
see. So you're, you're explicitly

141
00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.980
pointing out that it's okay,
we get that. You're an

142
00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:23.770
intern. We get, you have
no idea what you're doing

143
00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:27.190
and you can interrupt me
anytime. Yeah. It's kinda, it's

144
00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:30.280
setting up a bit of
a service relationship, you know,

145
00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.680
and a lot of this
is stolen directly from fog

146
00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:34.630
Creek. I mean, Joel has
blogged plenty of times about

147
00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:37.240
an upside down organization in
which Joel was at the

148
00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.940
service of developers. And, you
know, that goes all the

149
00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:41.650
way down. So when a
new intern shows up, we

150
00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:44.590
do try to make sure
that a significant percentage of

151
00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:46.510
full time developers time is
that the service of an

152
00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:49.690
intern. And when they first
show up, we just tell

153
00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:52.900
them that explicitly so that
they understand that, that we're

154
00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:56.440
taking, you know, we're investing
in them Now, can anyone

155
00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.960
be an intern or are
these all bachelor's degree students

156
00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.300
or master's degree students are,
they all have PhDs. What's

157
00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:04.840
the, what's an intern at
con It's all. It's just

158
00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:07.270
somebody who has made it
through our interview process. So

159
00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:09.820
we've had last summer, we
had six interns, two of

160
00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:12.610
which were high school students.
And they're both coming back.

161
00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:16.150
One is now a college
student. So we don't have

162
00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:19.120
any age requirements like anybody
else. We'd love to hire

163
00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:21.670
people who are going to
be entering their senior year

164
00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:23.440
in college so that we
can hire them full time

165
00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:26.140
if we'd like to, but
we don't, we don't have

166
00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:30.430
any requirements. We, we, we
also have graduate students Really.

167
00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:34.930
That's cool. So, so a
60 year old second career

168
00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:38.650
person could be an intern.
No problem. Yeah, actually that

169
00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:40.600
would be awesome. We, you
know, we don't have many

170
00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:44.770
of those people apply, but
that's kind of strongly in

171
00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:48.490
line with the general Khan
Academy vision, you know, stepping

172
00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:50.530
outside of the dev team
for a second. The idea

173
00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:52.360
that a 60 year old
can go learn whatever they

174
00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.820
want to learn. We get
emails from people like that

175
00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:56.910
that are Khan Academy all
the time. So it would

176
00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:59.670
be a pretty cool instantiation
if we were able to

177
00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:02.190
support that in our hiring
practices, we haven't had the

178
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:04.650
opportunity yet, but I have
a feeling there would be

179
00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:09.860
no corporate hesitation to do
that. That's very cool. All

180
00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:13.340
right, cool. So sometimes when
interns show up at companies,

181
00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:16.010
you know, their job is
to like install hard drives

182
00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:19.940
and clean up the, the,
the hardware room. You know,

183
00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:23.420
I know that, and I
would publicly apologize for the

184
00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:25.070
interns that I have had
do such things in the

185
00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:31.790
past. What do your interns
do? Yeah. So our, our

186
00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:35.150
main goal is to make
sure that interns experience what

187
00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:37.070
it would be like to
be a full time developer,

188
00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:39.350
not just for their own
sake, but also so that

189
00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:43.040
we understand how they're going
to handle being thrown into

190
00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:47.000
the deep end. There's really
two things going on there.

191
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.310
I mean, first of all,
any intern that you hire,

192
00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:52.070
especially in, in dev these
days probably has a ton

193
00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:55.040
of opportunity. They could be
working on a lot of

194
00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:58.130
really cool places. So it
feels a little bit weird

195
00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:00.050
to throw somebody at a
whole bunch of really boring

196
00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:03.110
bugs that nobody else wanted
to fix, or, you know,

197
00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:06.260
have them get coffee or
whatever. So just out of,

198
00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:07.880
just out of respect for
them, we make sure that

199
00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.880
they're working on things that
are pretty integral to the

200
00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:15.890
port, to the product itself.
And secondly, we we've found

201
00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:18.770
that they do, they do
a great job when you,

202
00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:21.380
when you, when you give
them a challenge. So when

203
00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:24.320
our entrance show up, we
kind of, we, we tell

204
00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:25.700
them what team they're going
to be a part of

205
00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:27.680
what their big goal for
the end of the summer

206
00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:30.500
is. And then we, we
get them started on some

207
00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:32.510
small projects, but they have
a big vision in mind

208
00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:34.250
and they're going to be
working on stuff that's shipping

209
00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:37.070
to users. And that's, that's
kind kinda the main goal.

210
00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.370
Is that really important for
an internship program that they,

211
00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:43.340
they work on publicly facing,
or maybe a better word

212
00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:46.070
would be visible projects and
not just like your latest

213
00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:49.700
batch file? I think so.
Yeah. I mean, we lost

214
00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:52.430
an intern to a company.
I won't say any names,

215
00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:54.860
but we lost an intern
to a, a better company

216
00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:59.450
now, yours, who we were
recruiting pretty heavily and a

217
00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:01.640
week into the internship, he
called me and said, you

218
00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:03.170
know, I've made a huge
mistake. I want to come

219
00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:06.800
to con next summer, I'm
working on the internal Wiki

220
00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:10.490
documentation system that no user's
ever going see, and this

221
00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:13.160
isn't, this, isn't the experience
that I want. And, and

222
00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.200
that makes sense to me.
I mean, it, it feels

223
00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:17.000
like if you have a
lot of opportunities for your

224
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.850
internship, you want to go
get an experience that's in

225
00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:22.070
line with how you want
to spend your career. And

226
00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:24.740
for us, that's working on
features that are going to

227
00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:26.870
touch a whole bunch of
students or whole bunch of

228
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:30.680
users. So we don't, we
don't want to, we don't

229
00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:33.620
want to just use them
for, for grunt work cause

230
00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:36.740
that doesn't, it doesn't tend
to produce the best results

231
00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:40.160
I think for either party.
Right. Everyone loses in that

232
00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:43.640
case. Yeah. Yeah. I think,
you know, all of this

233
00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:46.520
stuff, all of this stuff
we advocate about mentorship is

234
00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:49.130
really just about taking a
really long view about your

235
00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:52.280
relationship with an intern and
not hoping that they can

236
00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:56.980
get X of work accomplished,
but instead hoping that you

237
00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:59.680
build a good relationship with
somebody who's really talented and

238
00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:01.810
that that's going to come
back in a strong way.

239
00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:04.000
And obviously it does, if
you are able to hire

240
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.770
them, but even if you're
not, you know, I still

241
00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:08.320
have lots of good relationships
with interns who I don't

242
00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:09.790
work with right now, who
I might work with in

243
00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:12.670
the future and who have
benefited Khan Academy in various

244
00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:15.250
ways, just by talking about,
as they're spreading good word

245
00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:18.100
know, spreading good attitude about
the company and things like

246
00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:21.810
that. What do you think
that big unnamed companies that

247
00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:25.770
are not Microsoft to have
had that problem? Why is

248
00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:28.620
it that interns end up
working on internal Wiki documentation

249
00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:32.790
and doing totally boring automation
work and not hard work?

250
00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:37.770
Yeah, that's a good question.
You know, I, I've been

251
00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:39.660
kind of layman that I
haven't, I haven't been a

252
00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:41.550
part of one of those
big companies yet, I think,

253
00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:43.020
and I do actually think
that would be a good

254
00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:48.100
experience to have, I, I
would guess that the, the

255
00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:50.700
instances in which we are
most tempted to do that

256
00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:54.720
are when we haven't, we
haven't spent the time before

257
00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:58.110
the summer rolls around, figuring
out and preparing for good

258
00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:01.080
intern projects. And so, as
a result, you come in

259
00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:03.660
and the company or the
product, or the company is

260
00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:06.210
in a state where you
don't quite know what's going

261
00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:08.280
on next, or there's a
lot of confusion or there's

262
00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:10.200
a lot of design debate
about what the next teacher

263
00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.480
is going to be. And
so as a result, throwing

264
00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:14.490
an intern into the middle
of that is really difficult.

265
00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:17.160
So you kind of just
take the easy route and

266
00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:20.490
figure out, okay, well, you
know, we don't really, the

267
00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:22.680
intern doesn't really know exactly
what's going to be built.

268
00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:24.300
So let's find some small
things and have them do

269
00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:26.190
that. And I have a
feeling that the bigger the

270
00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:28.080
company gets in, the more
insurance you get, the harder

271
00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:30.210
it is to properly prepare
so that an intern can

272
00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:32.910
hit the ground running with
a well designed product or

273
00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:36.810
well designed project. So I
don't know, I'm, I'm hesitant

274
00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:38.670
to attribute any evil to
it. I think it's just

275
00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:40.720
a matter of you get
a lot of interns and

276
00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:43.920
you have to really work
to prepare for that. So

277
00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:46.500
how much preparation are you
doing? Like, are you getting

278
00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:49.260
the product ready for the
people to show up? Because,

279
00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.780
I mean, I realize that
if you throw a bunch

280
00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:54.750
of new people into an
unorganized environment, they're going to

281
00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:58.680
freak out, but there's gotta
be a balance. Like if

282
00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:02.670
you have an unorganized environment,
then there's, it's going to

283
00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:04.560
be a messy internship, but
it's not, you don't want

284
00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.630
to like clean the house
before the maid shows up.

285
00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:09.630
So there's some amount of
preparation. Exactly. You don't want

286
00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:12.270
to clean the house. That's
not a realistic experience for

287
00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:14.970
the interns either. And also
you don't really have time

288
00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:16.410
to clean the house. You
know, you can't take three

289
00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:18.780
months off and stop working
on the product, prepare for

290
00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:23.370
interns. So, you know, there
is a balance there. And

291
00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:25.620
so it's a little bit
hard to define, but I

292
00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:29.010
do think that at least
my experience with most teams,

293
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.570
the more you aim towards
cleaning the house the better,

294
00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:36.120
because nobody's actually going to
clean the house before the

295
00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:40.260
maid arrives with interns, showing
up, at least the teams

296
00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:41.910
that I've been a part
of it it's much more

297
00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:44.250
tempting to just assume we're
going to figure it out

298
00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:46.440
once the interns get here.
So I think that the

299
00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:51.950
more you aim towards understanding
exactly what the main goals

300
00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:55.640
are for interns after they
arrive the better off you're

301
00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:59.120
going to be. That's not
a great answer, but you

302
00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:01.040
know, I've got a couple
of experiences with that is

303
00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:03.650
specifically a fall Creek. The
best summers that I was

304
00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:07.190
a part of were ones
where we had entire new

305
00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:11.120
releases planned, not, not the
actual specifics of features, but

306
00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:14.120
we knew the main goals
for our release plan going

307
00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:15.800
into the summer. And the
goal was to actually ship

308
00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.690
that release at the end
of the summer, or even

309
00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:21.140
entirely new products. The source
control product that flux reports

310
00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:24.380
on killing was launched initially
after an internship summer. And

311
00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:26.090
there was a lot of
work put in before the

312
00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:28.610
summer just figuring out what
the different components were that

313
00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:32.900
were being built. And conversely,
we had a, an earlier

314
00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:35.090
summer in which the goal
was to have interns come

315
00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:37.190
in and actually spec out
their own product with a

316
00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:40.430
very, very loose definition. And
that that summer was probably

317
00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:45.140
the least productive. So I
think, I think it's okay

318
00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:47.390
to aim for cleaning the
house because you're not actually

319
00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:49.780
going to do it In
your, in your blog posts,

320
00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:52.660
you, you implied that there
were months of preparation for,

321
00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:56.410
for interns to come. And
what does that mean? That

322
00:15:56.410 --> 00:15:58.930
might be months in linear
time, but you're not spending,

323
00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:04.930
you know, man months. That's
correct. Yeah. We're definitely not

324
00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:08.290
sitting down and blocking out
entire months to work. It's

325
00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:11.470
more that if you're going
to have 15 interns come

326
00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:14.770
in and you're a team
of 15, then the amount

327
00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:19.540
of creation that you can
do demands a fair amount

328
00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:24.370
of thought beforehand and design
work beforehand. And so those,

329
00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:28.210
those questions aren't always answered
sitting down and working in

330
00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:30.580
linear time. But instead you
have to start thinking beforehand

331
00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:32.650
and considering, okay, we're going
to have a whole lot

332
00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:36.190
of horsepower, where should we
point it? And that just

333
00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:39.310
needs to start months beforehand.
And for us, that means

334
00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:42.190
having meetings and figuring out
how the, how we're going

335
00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:44.650
to split into teams, because
we cross the threshold from

336
00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:47.080
10 to 15 people and
then throw one 15 more

337
00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:48.580
people. And all of us,
you can't have just one

338
00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:51.040
big team anymore. So that
was just figuring out how

339
00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:53.410
to split into teams. Who's
going to be mentoring in

340
00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:58.510
terms, going over things like
the explicit mentorship relationship that

341
00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:01.990
you and I just went
over preparing, you know, preparing

342
00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:04.660
mentors and other ways so
that they understand that everybody

343
00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:08.050
should be code reviewed equally
and, and sitting down and

344
00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:11.380
having people plan what their
goals are for the product

345
00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:14.140
and all that. Stuff's gonna
change over time. You know,

346
00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:16.090
as soon as the intern
works for the first week

347
00:17:16.090 --> 00:17:19.180
and is extremely productive or
slightly less than productive, those

348
00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:22.830
goals are gonna change. But
you know, th that, that

349
00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:25.390
thought process, I think, should
start months beforehand, if you're

350
00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:26.890
going to have, especially if
you have a one to

351
00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:30.250
one relationship between interns and
mentors, Things that I think

352
00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:31.990
that you've put a lot
of thought into, and I've

353
00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:35.620
really enjoyed reading on your
blog or Europeans on code

354
00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:38.710
reviews, you've got some pretty
strong opinions on code reviews

355
00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:42.400
as, as a way to
build a relationship with, with

356
00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:47.980
someone. Yeah. Yeah. And this
is something that has been

357
00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:51.360
forming over time as I've
code reviewed more and more

358
00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:53.070
people I've been a part
of code reviews and seeing

359
00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:57.220
much better code reviewers work.
But it's really interesting that,

360
00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:59.370
and I talk about this
with my friends, that when

361
00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:03.600
somebody comes out of college,
they're really used to handing

362
00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:06.180
in an English paper and
having red marks all over

363
00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:08.400
it, or, or a big
paragraph at the end in

364
00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:10.680
which the teacher critiques something.
And that's just kind of

365
00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:13.680
an accepted experience. And it
doesn't really drive people crazy.

366
00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:16.470
There's something about code, especially
people coming out of college.

367
00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:17.880
If, if you hand in
a bunch of code that

368
00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:20.550
you're really proud of, and
then somebody kind of marks

369
00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:24.030
it up in a friendly
way, it can be really

370
00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:27.990
jarring for people. And I
think that's just, yeah, I'm

371
00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:30.450
guessing that's just because people
aren't really used to code

372
00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:33.870
reviewing in college or before
they get into their professional

373
00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:36.750
environment, but it's, it's almost
insulting. You know, there's a

374
00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:40.020
lot of ego attached to
code often, and you have

375
00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:41.610
to kind of work. You
have to get past that

376
00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:43.080
and you have to build
a code of your environment

377
00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:46.590
in which it's healthy to
send little nitpicks to each

378
00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:48.510
other. And just, just for
the sake of teaching each

379
00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:50.170
other, not, you know, you
don't want to slow down

380
00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:53.760
the product, but you want
to share advice and you

381
00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:55.800
want to sit down with
somebody and work through these

382
00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:58.590
problems together so that they
know that you're not, you're

383
00:18:58.590 --> 00:19:02.640
not exerting mastery over them.
You're not saying I'm a

384
00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:04.260
better coder than you, and
you should do things this

385
00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:08.310
way. You're kind of exploring
the space of possible solutions

386
00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:11.070
with them. And that, that
doesn't come naturally with code

387
00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:14.550
reviews. There's something about them
that feels really, I don't

388
00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:17.730
know how to put a
Grady or it just, it

389
00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:20.850
just grates on people and
yep. You have to work

390
00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:23.130
hard to fix that relationship,
to fix that environment for

391
00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:25.890
us. That just means literally
saying code reviews happen all

392
00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:30.210
the time. Interns meant interns
code review. Full-timers just like

393
00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:33.780
full-timers code review interns, and
that's, that's not common, but

394
00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:37.380
it's really powerful. It balances
the relationship and we hire

395
00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:39.930
smart interns. So we want
to learn from them and

396
00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:42.180
telling people that, you know,
the things that I write

397
00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:43.590
in my code of you
are not a critique of

398
00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:47.010
you. They are, you know,
we're sharing information back and

399
00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:50.370
forth. And the more we
just say that stuff explicitly

400
00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:52.260
all the time and our,
in our meetings and stuff.

401
00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:56.430
And I think that that
helps the environment. It helps

402
00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:59.100
you build a good relationship
with somebody you're you're working

403
00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:01.190
with. The idea is that
you had, that is a

404
00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:06.530
little bit out, there was
that new developers should review

405
00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:09.110
the code of an experienced
developer. So do you have

406
00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:12.260
interns review your code? Yeah,
yeah, I do. I had

407
00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:15.230
that happened, I think yesterday.
And it happens even more

408
00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:16.940
with people who are actually
writing a fair amount of

409
00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:20.240
code these days. I'm not
doing so much, but that's,

410
00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:23.270
you know, reviewing someone's code
is a great way to

411
00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:26.120
learn about what's going on.
And a number of the

412
00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:28.220
people who have joined us
from Google and pointed out

413
00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:30.410
that, you know, they had
a nice system set up

414
00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:33.290
such that all code reviews
were kind of streamed through

415
00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:34.940
the whole company. So it
was really easy to just

416
00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:37.580
watch somebody else review codes
or look at somebody else's

417
00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:39.740
code review. So when I
ask an intern to review

418
00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:41.480
my code, you know, not
only am I asking for

419
00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:43.670
help from them, but I'm
asking them to just be

420
00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:46.610
aware of the code that
I'm working on and maybe

421
00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:50.170
learn from the change that
I'm making. So it's not,

422
00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:53.860
you know, code reviews are
seen as now you go

423
00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:55.990
approve my code, but that's
not really what it is.

424
00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:58.900
It's more, Hey, let's, you
know, let's make sure that

425
00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:01.240
this code makes sense together
and that's going to involve

426
00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:03.700
learning on both sides of
the equation. So I think

427
00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:06.520
it's really helpful and it
makes it, it also just

428
00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:09.280
eases the tension in the
relationship. You know, if I'm

429
00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:10.690
going to send an intern,
a code of you and

430
00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:13.630
it's going to have 15
little comments in it, it

431
00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:16.780
certainly feels a lot better
if I'm also offering out

432
00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:18.550
my toe to them and
I can see what advice

433
00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:21.220
they have for me just
as a, a, not just

434
00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:24.930
as a social, socially balancing
factor. Well, it's interesting the

435
00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:28.080
idea that a code review
is different than a code

436
00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:32.400
approval process. Yeah. Yeah. I
think that's, I think that's

437
00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:36.630
pretty important. I mean, it's
definitely, there's definitely approval, but

438
00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:40.560
we don't view code reviews
as this is the reviewer

439
00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:42.930
signing off that there are
no bugs in this code

440
00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:45.960
instead it is. Does this
code make sense to the

441
00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:50.640
reviewer in a quick glance?
So, you know, is this

442
00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:54.000
code kind of sensible and
are there any, are there

443
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.700
any major problems and as
long as, as long as

444
00:21:56.700 --> 00:22:00.150
that's not the case, then
the code review is more

445
00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:03.750
so just about making people
aware of various changes that

446
00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:07.230
are going on and other,
other parts of the code

447
00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:10.320
base, How important is it
to do code reviews in

448
00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:12.420
person? Cause I know that
there are some remotes and

449
00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:15.150
you've worked with remotes before
and I've done a lot

450
00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:18.720
of screen screen-sharing code reviews,
and I've also done a

451
00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:21.300
number of things with tools
where we have, where someone

452
00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:23.250
will do a code review
kind of all by themselves.

453
00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:25.320
And they'll send the review
off and we've seen the

454
00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:28.800
tools like that on Google
code and get hub what's,

455
00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:32.160
you know, how does code
reviewing relate to pair programming

456
00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:36.360
and building relationships? How important
is that? Yeah, that's a

457
00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:40.050
good question. We try to,
we do the vast majority

458
00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:43.650
of our reviews using salt,
you know, not, not side

459
00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:46.740
by side, w we're all
pretty much in person except

460
00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:48.660
for a few remote people.
So most of it is

461
00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:52.020
done in the same office,
but it's done asynchronously, but

462
00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:55.110
we try to balance that
with having people sit down

463
00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:58.440
together and actually look through
code together in person occasionally.

464
00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:03.870
And I think it's important
because for one reason, a

465
00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:06.270
lot of code review tools
are deficient in one way,

466
00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:08.700
in my opinion, which is
that it's really, really, really

467
00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:12.240
easy to point out problems.
And everybody thinks that's the

468
00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:15.300
purpose of a code review,
but you know, as cheesy

469
00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:17.220
as it sounds, there's no
like button or there's no

470
00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:19.740
thumbs up or anything like
that, you have to consciously,

471
00:23:20.250 --> 00:23:23.400
you have to consciously point
out which pieces of the

472
00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:25.980
code that you like, because
chances are, if you're looking

473
00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:27.840
through a whole bunch of
code from a smart coworker,

474
00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:30.000
there's a whole bunch of
brilliance in there, which you're

475
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.130
just going to ignore. It's
kind of like a goalie

476
00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:33.930
in soccer. You just ignore
the fact that they don't

477
00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:35.730
get scored on, but then
you point out all the

478
00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:38.370
problems and that doesn't really
seem healthy. And that's what

479
00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:41.460
most code of your tools
are geared towards. So we

480
00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:45.620
actually explicitly, again, encourage people
pointing out good parts of

481
00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:47.360
the code or the things
that, you know, if I,

482
00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:48.770
if I could have be
somebody, I learn a new

483
00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:50.150
trick, I'll, I'm going to
point that out in the

484
00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:51.800
code of you and say,
I didn't notice this is

485
00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:55.820
cool. And that happens much
more naturally when you're in

486
00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:59.330
person, you don't have to
as consciously think about that.

487
00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:01.580
So, you know, that's one
of the good that's. One

488
00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:02.990
of the reasons we encourage
a little bit of in

489
00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:05.540
person interaction in code is
because it's a little bit

490
00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:08.450
more humane than what most
code of your tools would

491
00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:11.330
encourage, which is just pointing
out problem, political problem. We

492
00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:13.900
don't problem reject or approve.
I'm trying to get my

493
00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:16.540
head around how you keep
focused on the people and

494
00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:19.090
not the code because Leon
Gursing who I talked to

495
00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:21.310
last week had this comment
that he would like to

496
00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:23.860
sit down with someone when
he pairs and then he

497
00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:28.000
purposely writes the worst possible
code that he can think

498
00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.700
of in order to bring
that person out. Even the

499
00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:35.320
shyest developer likes to feel
superior. So he will write

500
00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:38.200
really horrible, horrible code or
show someone awful code. You

501
00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:40.660
got to try this because
you're like the lead dev,

502
00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:42.430
right? So make them show
them the worst thing you've

503
00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:45.460
ever written, or maybe even
gag code and see if

504
00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:49.000
the intern will jump in
and take the bait. And

505
00:24:49.090 --> 00:24:52.090
will w would that change
the relationship like would a

506
00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:55.390
new intern on day two,
tell the lead developer at

507
00:24:55.390 --> 00:24:57.520
the place he just showed
up at that? This is

508
00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:01.930
awful. That's a great idea.
I love that. I, you

509
00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:03.880
know, I joked and I
don't actually have to try.

510
00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:05.770
There's plenty of that around
the code base that people

511
00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:09.400
eventually will start laughing at,
but I really like that.

512
00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:11.350
I might have to steal
that and try that and

513
00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:14.680
see what happens, because that's
exactly what you want. You

514
00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:18.460
want a first day intern
to show up, willing to

515
00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:20.740
call out the lead developer
when they're doing something stupid,

516
00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:23.980
because it happens a lot.
And you know, a lot

517
00:25:24.010 --> 00:25:26.770
in many cases they know
way better. So, you know,

518
00:25:26.770 --> 00:25:29.230
that's great. And I like
just the idea of drawing

519
00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:33.400
somebody on making them confident
is it's huge. And, you

520
00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:35.170
know, code review that code
of your trick as a

521
00:25:35.170 --> 00:25:37.060
great way to do it.
And the other big part

522
00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:40.150
of our mentorship push is
just, we say it all

523
00:25:40.150 --> 00:25:43.270
the time. We just encourage
people to brag. Basically. You

524
00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:45.580
know, one of the biggest
problems when interns come in

525
00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:48.970
is that they think that
their work isn't worthy of

526
00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:50.770
sharing. And you talk about
this all the time with

527
00:25:50.770 --> 00:25:53.380
public speaking and blogging, but
it takes the form of

528
00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:55.630
all types of outlets. You
know, we encourage people to

529
00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:59.110
just in our internal chat
room, post screenshots of what

530
00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:03.250
they've just shipped, you know,
talk in company meetings about

531
00:26:03.250 --> 00:26:05.260
what they just did, any
chance that they can get

532
00:26:05.290 --> 00:26:08.620
to brag. We encourage that.
And you know, it's kinda

533
00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:10.810
the same thing. It's not
a, it's not the same

534
00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:14.080
as tricking somebody into and
to showing off how much

535
00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:17.140
they know compared to the
lead developer. But you, you

536
00:26:17.170 --> 00:26:19.990
really do have to work
past that tendency to believe

537
00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:24.460
that your, your work isn't
that important because you know,

538
00:26:24.910 --> 00:26:29.650
as soon as because oftentimes
it is The final thing

539
00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:32.230
that you have on your
code reviews is relationship builders

540
00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:35.620
is the idea that devalue
the code on the team

541
00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:39.820
like for freshly written code
can be thrown out. Yeah,

542
00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:44.130
yeah, exactly. That happens. And
that's going to, especially with,

543
00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:45.570
you know, if you have
a bunch of new people

544
00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:47.970
come in, sometimes you'll work
on something and you just

545
00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:50.550
discover that it's not the
right solution. And sometimes it's

546
00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:53.400
not even the right product.
There, there are a million

547
00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:57.450
reasons that code can be
thrown out and you, that

548
00:26:57.450 --> 00:26:59.970
can be, that can be
pretty jarring, especially for somebody

549
00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:01.920
who comes in and thinks
that they're being judged. It's

550
00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:05.010
very hard to take somebody
who you really respect, but

551
00:27:05.010 --> 00:27:07.080
who also thinks that they're
being judged with respect to

552
00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:09.930
being hired full time and
say, you're doing a great

553
00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:13.290
job and get them to
believe that. But then simultaneously

554
00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:15.810
say we're throwing this code
out. That's, that's pretty tricky

555
00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:18.570
thing to do, but it
honestly does happen. You know,

556
00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:21.540
we've thrown out code before
from people that we absolutely

557
00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:25.560
want to hire a full
time. And that's, you know,

558
00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:28.760
saying de-value the code and
value people is one thing

559
00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:31.470
getting it done in practice
is really tricky. And I

560
00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:34.140
think the best thing you
can do is have, full-timers

561
00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:37.890
just demonstrate, you know, I
threw away my code and

562
00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:39.630
be public about it and
say, you know what? We

563
00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:42.180
just raped a bunch of
my code. That's what happens.

564
00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:44.280
I'm actually glad that this
code has gone now. You

565
00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:47.670
know, whatever, whatever it takes
to set an example of

566
00:27:48.390 --> 00:27:51.270
it being okay to throw
away code I is pretty

567
00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:54.380
important. And I like that
you say don't swoop in

568
00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:57.230
with the hammer of truth,
right. When you're interacting with

569
00:27:57.230 --> 00:27:58.850
some per new person, the
last thing you want to

570
00:27:58.850 --> 00:28:01.310
do is, is set the
tone that like, Hey, Hey

571
00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:04.700
intern, just to make sure
you're clear. I'm awesome. And

572
00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:06.680
here's how you need to
do things, you know, and

573
00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:09.230
then bring the hammer down.
Yeah, I think that's just

574
00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:12.860
about it. Not only is
that not helpful for the

575
00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:14.990
intern, but that's just going
to get you at some

576
00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:17.180
point when, when you're wrong
and you're going to feel

577
00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:21.950
like an idiot. It's just
not helpful. You know, you,

578
00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:24.050
it's true that you might,
that, you know, a lot

579
00:28:24.050 --> 00:28:26.150
more about the code base
or in, you know, maybe

580
00:28:26.150 --> 00:28:29.990
the technology and the interim,
but that doesn't last very

581
00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:32.390
long because they're going to
be working pretty hard and

582
00:28:32.390 --> 00:28:35.450
they're younger than you and
their brains are probably learning

583
00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:38.750
faster. And, you know, you
just have to realize that

584
00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:41.690
whatever, whatever little thing you
know is probably not that

585
00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:44.690
important compared to compared to
the work that you're doing.

586
00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:46.910
So sloping in with a
hammer of truth is just,

587
00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:50.120
I dunno, it just doesn't,
it doesn't appeal to me

588
00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:54.350
on multiple levels. Very cool.
And do you definitely think

589
00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:56.420
that code reviews are required?
Like if you heard that

590
00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:58.040
there was a company that
did not do code reviews,

591
00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:01.340
what would you feel about
that? Yeah, depending on who

592
00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:03.890
you ask in Khan Academy,
you'll get slightly different answers

593
00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:05.990
here. I wouldn't be that.
It depends on the size

594
00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:08.590
of the company. I certainly
don't think that, you know,

595
00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:11.360
a company of five or
less, and some people would

596
00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:13.160
disagree with me, but I
don't, I don't think it's

597
00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:15.830
as critical cause it's easier
to know what's going on

598
00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:18.530
in the product and not
having not have something go

599
00:29:18.530 --> 00:29:25.190
crazy. I was shocked when
we instituted required code reviews

600
00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:28.460
here, that it didn't slow
things down a bunch. And

601
00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:31.610
I was initially hesitant. I
was scared. I thought that's

602
00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:33.830
really silly if I just
had a comment who needs

603
00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:35.690
to review that, just let
me shift things and get

604
00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:38.960
things done. But, you know,
we just kind of set

605
00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:43.060
the rule. Everything gets code
reviewed, and it's been, it's

606
00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:45.850
actually been really, really, really
healthy for our code base.

607
00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:49.390
And it hasn't slowed us
down, which is what I

608
00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:53.560
was initially freaked out about.
So I would encourage everybody

609
00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:58.540
to strongly consider required code
reviews and at least at

610
00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:01.870
least experiment with it because
the downsides that I expected

611
00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:05.250
actually, weren't really there. And
last question is how much

612
00:30:05.250 --> 00:30:07.740
time do you spend, like
in like a 40 hours

613
00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:10.170
a week or some number
of hours coding, how much

614
00:30:10.170 --> 00:30:12.360
is spent in code reviews?
Cause sometimes you can end

615
00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:15.360
up in these Epic code
review meetings with like where

616
00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:18.360
people are just checking emails.
Yeah. We don't really have

617
00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:21.870
code review meetings. And in
fact it's pretty rare. Almost

618
00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:24.810
all code reviews are done
by one person or maybe

619
00:30:24.810 --> 00:30:27.300
two if, but it's, it's
pretty rare to have three

620
00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:30.000
people. Well, sorry, there's the
author of the code. And

621
00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.560
then maybe two other people,
it's pretty rare to have

622
00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:35.340
three reviewers. So it doesn't
get that out of control.

623
00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:38.970
The other part of required
the other effective required code

624
00:30:38.970 --> 00:30:43.110
of use. That's really nice
is that it's far less

625
00:30:43.170 --> 00:30:46.590
common for you to have
some massive, huge diff that's

626
00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:51.030
being reviewed because you're reviewing
along the way a frequent

627
00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:53.850
digestible code of use is
the policy that we constantly

628
00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:58.140
emphasize here. So it's, it's
pretty rare to get into

629
00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:01.050
some sort of huge debate.
Now that being said my

630
00:31:01.050 --> 00:31:03.630
time right now, I spent
way more time code reviewing

631
00:31:03.630 --> 00:31:05.670
and coding right now. But
that's just because of the

632
00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:09.060
way I've specifically set up
my situation. People who are

633
00:31:09.390 --> 00:31:12.230
closer to the code. Yeah.
I would say you can

634
00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:14.460
get as close to it
can get, you know, 30,

635
00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:16.650
40, 50% of your time
can be spent coded doing.

636
00:31:16.650 --> 00:31:20.220
But if that's happening, that's
probably a sign that other

637
00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:24.210
people are producing a lot
beneath you and All right.

638
00:31:24.210 --> 00:31:26.190
Cool. Well, thanks so much
for talking to me today,

639
00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:31.410
Ben. Yeah, I appreciate it.
It's been fun. We'll put

640
00:31:31.410 --> 00:31:33.930
links to Ben's blog and
his Twitter up on the

641
00:31:33.930 --> 00:31:36.750
show site. And of course,
if you haven't heard about

642
00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:39.030
the Khan Academy, you need
to ask somebody because it's

643
00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:43.050
really something special. Thanks so
much. This has been another

644
00:31:43.050 --> 00:31:45.900
episode of Hansel minutes and
we'll see you again next

645
00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:46.200
week.
