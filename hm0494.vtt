our weekly discussion with web
developer and technologist Scott Hanselman.

9
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.990
This is Lawrence Ryan announcing show
number four 98. In this

10
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.250
episode, Scott talks with ocean
softwares, Matthew Kennon about Sid

11
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.940
chips and video game soundtracks.
Hi everybody. This is another

12
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.500
episode of Hansel minutes, and
I'm talking with Matthew Cannon of

13
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.490
formerly of ocean software and
you know, a legendary composer

14
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.210
of a Commodore 64 music
amongst other kinds of musics

15
00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.360
throughout the eighties and nineties.
How are you? I'm fantastic.

16
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.020
Good to speak to you,
Scott. So you can't stand

17
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.600
listening to yourself either. I
feel the same way, no,

18
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.680
myself or my own music,
but I'm so we'll get

19
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.060
on just fine. It's listening
back to your own music

20
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.150
is, is I suppose it's
somewhat like listening back to

21
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.110
your own voice on your
podcasts. For some people it's

22
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.140
uncomfortable. For me, it always
has been, even when I

23
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.770
had a piece perform live
by a small orchestra, many

24
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.500
years after my video game
music, I was so excited

25
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.140
for the, for the occasion.
But when the occasion came,

26
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.820
I was, you know, I
wanted to hide. It's strange.

27
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.200
It's a strange thing. I
don't know. I think a

28
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.710
lot of artists getting that
feeling. So how did you

29
00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.260
get started making music for
video games? How does that

30
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:15.060
work? Well, the question, how
does it work? That used

31
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.550
to drive me a little
bit crazy when I was

32
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.360
a kid. So sobbing, I
dunno, probably from the age

33
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:28.260
of 12, maybe 13 when
I had my first home

34
00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.510
computer, which was, I think
the Vic 20 and then

35
00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.440
very shortly afterwards, the Commodore
64. And that thought of,

36
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.480
you know, how do you
get started on this? That's

37
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.200
what drove me really, because
I heard some fantastic sounds

38
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.670
coming out of the machine
and I didn't have any

39
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.310
other musical instruments in the
house really, apart from the

40
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.510
old electronic organ, which didn't
really work properly. And so

41
00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.120
I heard fantastic sounds coming
from this machine. I couldn't

42
00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.750
believe that it was a
64 K machine and it

43
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.800
puzzled me. How would you
make music that is so

44
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.900
detailed, involved and, and multilayered
in this, in this small

45
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.700
box. So getting started meant
going through some of the

46
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.730
old manuals that you'd normally
get from your, from your

47
00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.100
machine. You know, you don't
wrap the machine, get it

48
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.290
set up and everything, and
the manual will be tossed

49
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.140
into the, into the box
because you just want to

50
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.150
get video games on that's,
how it was back then,

51
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:32.920
but sooner or later, the
video games became so rich

52
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.610
in, in that all audio
and visual presentation that I

53
00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.710
have to reach for the
manual, because I thought, well,

54
00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:42.820
someone must have started somewhere
making such fantastic graphics, fantastic

55
00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.310
music. So I start thumbing
through the manuals and of

56
00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.830
course the manuals don't tell
you very much at all.

57
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.790
And that's where you draw,
draw a blank really as

58
00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.310
a 12, 13 year old
kid, where do you go

59
00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.670
from there? That's one of
the hardest things to, to

60
00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.310
work out. So I started
hacking into, into the, the

61
00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.770
running games, into the running
code, using some cartridges that

62
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.190
were popular at the time,
such as freeze frame, all

63
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.100
completely legal stuff. You could
buy these things that the

64
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.950
high street, but the idea
was that you would interrupt

65
00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.910
the running of the program,
do a soft reset of

66
00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.930
the machine and then get
into the machine code to

67
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.030
work out what it was
doing. So it was a

68
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.560
way of interrupting the, the,
the current state of the,

69
00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.450
of, of the Commodore 64,
for example, and getting into

70
00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:36.340
the machine code monitor and
understanding the instructions and cross-referencing

71
00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.640
with the manual locate. So
this register, this, this chip

72
00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.460
address is the volume. Okay.
So let's do a search

73
00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.040
through all of the code.
Not very much of it.

74
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.700
This is only 64, but
you know, let's find the

75
00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:55.150
registers that correspond to sound
the sound chip. The yet

76
00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.390
let's find those in the
machine code that was being

77
00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:02.710
presented. And eventually through just
hacking away at the various

78
00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.340
registers of the such it
through interrupting all the other

79
00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.210
games, other people's work, I
was able to sort of

80
00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:15.610
reverse engineer some stuff. And
then really there was some

81
00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.100
commercial programs that came out
around around that time as

82
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.570
well. We have things like
electro sound and micro rhythm,

83
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.920
things like that, which allowed
you to make fairly rudimentary

84
00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.720
music on the 64. So
there's said chip sound, interface

85
00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.990
device. And people say that
this is the chip that

86
00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:38.770
really made this color 64,
what? It was like, it

87
00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.440
was the bestselling computer in
history. And it was because

88
00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.950
of this fascinating. Yeah, there
was nothing else like it.

89
00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.660
The other home computers at
the time really came with

90
00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:54.040
either a buzzer speaker, which
is a very tinny speaker

91
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.010
that's built into the machine
or something like an AYA,

92
00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.140
which is more like a,
it's like a doorbell sound,

93
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:02.630
you know, that sort of
square wave sound. A lot

94
00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:04.370
of these machines have had
this at the time. Like

95
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.920
there's that X spectrum and
so on. And the Nintendo,

96
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:10.040
I think the Nintendo was
an a Y chip as

97
00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.010
well. So the said was
a complete departure from that.

98
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.600
The sound architecture of the
Sid was first firstly, three

99
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:24.350
channels. So polyphonic music was
possible. Whereas with the, some

100
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:30.800
of the early machines that
just wasn't wasn't achievable. Secondly,

101
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:34.620
it was designed by as
far as I'm aware and,

102
00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:37.310
and sign an engineer from
an Sonic or who went

103
00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:40.490
on to be a and
Sonic engineer anyway. So very

104
00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:47.780
well established synthesizer company. So
when you take, for example,

105
00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:50.540
some of the analog synthesizers
that were available at the

106
00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:53.360
time that many of our
sort of eighties bands were

107
00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.730
using like the roll and
Juno sex, which is behind

108
00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:59.300
me here, the architecture of
the chip inside the machine

109
00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.220
behind me here is very
similar to that of the

110
00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:05.630
suit. It allows you to
do Sawtooth pulls away forms,

111
00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:08.780
noise, apply filters and so
on. So it completely part

112
00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:14.720
of them, all of the,
the other computer computer, the

113
00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:21.050
home computers at the time,
simply because someone somewhere decided

114
00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:23.330
that this machine would have
to be different on audio.

115
00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:27.800
And it's just completely different.
Nothing like it at the

116
00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.400
time, really people say though,
that the folks who designed

117
00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.250
the Sid chip weren't a
hundred percent happy with it.

118
00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:39.380
And that maybe it was
released unfinished. Yes. I've heard

119
00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:47.270
similar reports. One I'm aware
of though is, is as

120
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:50.080
I dug into the inner
workings of the set and

121
00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:52.970
use some of the music
routines that were developed open

122
00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:56.810
software for example, was that
it was possibly released buggy.

123
00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:59.360
So there were some aspects
of it that, that did

124
00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.610
have books, but we use,
we started to find them

125
00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:04.880
and use them to our
advantage. So there were things

126
00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:07.250
that you could do to
combine wave forms that were

127
00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:13.580
probably not expected by the
original designers, but we did

128
00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:15.740
that anyway. And if you
listen to some, there are

129
00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:20.120
some pieces which actually demonstrate
that quite, quite obviously, they're

130
00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:24.620
reliable, it's reliably buggy, it's
reliably buggy. And, you know,

131
00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:28.070
there are some of the
finest synthesizes in the world.

132
00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:31.730
An example is a Yamaha
CSIT, which I've got behind

133
00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:33.950
me here as well. If
you play a Sawtooth wave

134
00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:36.860
form on that machine, it's
got a book in it.

135
00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:39.200
So that the wave format,
if you play through an

136
00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.800
oscilloscope has a little glitch
in it, but that adds

137
00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:45.320
character. You see that adds
a certain character to that

138
00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:47.810
synthesizer. And now it's a,
it's a legend. And I

139
00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:53.060
think the <inaudible> had all
of these features as we

140
00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:58.080
sometimes call them in. They
weren't, it was character added

141
00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:02.580
character. So yeah, we loved
it. Absolutely loved it. And

142
00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:06.200
The, the, the Sid sound
chip has become, I mean,

143
00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:10.040
ordinarily, you would think of
it as C 64 sound,

144
00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:12.620
but the chip itself is
so iconic that it's referred

145
00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:18.950
to as Sid music. Yes,
yes it is. Now nobody

146
00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:23.690
could be more surprised than
me, really, for me, music

147
00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:26.120
and video games was about
the Commodore 64. It was

148
00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.550
never about the <inaudible>. In
fact, I think when I

149
00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:33.470
started at ocean software back
in 88, 89, I think

150
00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:38.240
it was 88. The word
said really wasn't mentioned, you

151
00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.700
know, we didn't talk about
what the sin registers were

152
00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:43.070
so much. We just knew
that these certain addresses could

153
00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:47.420
be poked and certain things
would happen. So the initials

154
00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.220
Sid really didn't come up
very often. It was just

155
00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:53.720
the Commodore 64. It makes
a fantastic sound. Most of

156
00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:57.490
the games that we, we,
we publish on the 64

157
00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:04.070
have great soundtracks. So fast
forward 15, 20 years later.

158
00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:07.760
And to find people talking
about said music, it's quite

159
00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.790
extraordinary because I mean, we've
got, we've got seven modules

160
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:15.830
now, like the heartset, which
is an external rat mounted

161
00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.940
simulator of the city, you
know, with dedicated citizens. And

162
00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:22.040
it's extraordinary. I would never
have thought of hearing anything

163
00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:24.560
like that. It's great. I'm
I wish I had it.

164
00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:27.080
I wish I had, you
know, eight sit chips, my,

165
00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:31.370
my 64 games that would
have been fantastic, but it

166
00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:35.810
was nice in a way
though, to be restricted by

167
00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:39.850
what the sip couldn't couldn't
do, you know? Well, and

168
00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:42.890
now there's online collections. There's
the high voltage Syd collection.

169
00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:47.930
That's got something like 40,000
Sid examples. And then there's

170
00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:50.060
the Sid player. You can
play sad music on your

171
00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:56.120
webpages now. Exactly. Yeah. The
sip player, it's extraordinary. And

172
00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:59.120
just the, the level of
detail that the developer of

173
00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:02.270
a, of a, an emulator
will go to, to emulate

174
00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:05.540
the certain characteristics and to
play the groms through it

175
00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:08.150
and stuff like that. It's
just, it takes a lot

176
00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:12.350
of dedication. I've thought about,
do my own ass two

177
00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:15.650
64 in my own way.
And I think at some

178
00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:17.450
point I do want to
do this. I want to

179
00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:24.230
create a, an IDE for
a said music that's web

180
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:28.130
based. So as a web
browser or digital channel based

181
00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:31.640
app, anyway, that allows you
to offer, sit music, you

182
00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:36.140
know, through the browser. So
I'll have to do that.

183
00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:39.710
I must do that. It's
something I've had a hat

184
00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:42.140
on, on the back burner
for awhile. We'll find out

185
00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:44.480
an audience of volunteers though,
that are listening right now.

186
00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:47.210
Absolutely. I mean, it's kind
of, isn't it to be

187
00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:49.850
great. I mean, you know,
to have a, I dunno,

188
00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:54.250
a fully responsive and adaptive
website to play such tunes

189
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:56.200
and to, to code it
in such a way that,

190
00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:59.890
you know, very, very faithful
to how we used to

191
00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:02.050
write our music back in
the day, because we used

192
00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:04.720
to write it by going
to, you know, we not

193
00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:11.740
only had to code the,
the, the routines to poke

194
00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:14.050
the registers into the such
effort to get the right

195
00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:17.080
frequencies and wave forms going
and so on. But we

196
00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:20.830
have to inform the city
for what to play my

197
00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:27.340
very intricately scribbling, that every
single possible note that you

198
00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:29.650
could have between, you know,
the C and the G

199
00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:34.960
or whatever, and I'm getting
the frequencies and lengths of,

200
00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:38.530
of note. Exactly. Right. So
it took a lot of

201
00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:44.110
intricate noodling messing about experiments,
failing and all sorts of

202
00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:47.230
things. It was fantastic, but
yeah, bite by bite note,

203
00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:51.580
by note, and eventually when
it played back at your

204
00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:54.130
60 Hertz or whatever, I
think it was 50 Hertz

205
00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:57.460
in the States. Actually, I
think, I think the 64

206
00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:59.740
was playing at a different
rate in the, in the

207
00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:01.960
States. Maybe some of the
music was playing faster, I

208
00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:05.580
think. Did you know how
to write music though, when

209
00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:06.990
you were doing this, like
you were saying that your

210
00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:09.510
writing is, is there a
generation of people who did

211
00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:12.210
this work, who don't know
how to write music, like

212
00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:15.810
on a musical score, what
they write, they know how

213
00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:19.200
to write, So they know
how to write the points.

214
00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:22.770
That's right. So you have
three chances to work with.

215
00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:26.640
So you have three chances
here. Really. You can either

216
00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:28.950
go for the monophonic sound,
you know, the sort of

217
00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:31.800
riff or heavy riff sound.
And if you were not

218
00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:34.050
mus musically oriented, then you
can get away with that.

219
00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:36.660
You know, you could do,
you could play some very

220
00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:39.400
strong notes and just blow
them out of the city

221
00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:42.030
and try and get it
bit and get a satisfying

222
00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:43.890
sound, you know, and I've
got some filters on that

223
00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:46.290
and stuff like that. But
if you're more inclined to,

224
00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:50.100
to writing music out and
thinking about how it works

225
00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:53.850
polyphonically and all the rest
of it and more traditionally

226
00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:57.930
musical, then you've got three
channels to do that with.

227
00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:02.160
So, yeah, it's still the,
you know, bite by bite

228
00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.290
rule. It has to go
in like that it's quite

229
00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:08.820
tedious, but a lot of
us would put a bit

230
00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:12.600
of music into the 64
through our proprietary system, which

231
00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:15.240
is a crazy system. I
have to tell you about

232
00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:19.680
play a little back and
then maybe scribble some down

233
00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:22.350
on the stave, playing on
the piano, go back to

234
00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:25.530
the 64, maybe get your
feedback from the 64. What

235
00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:28.140
it can do, go back
to the staves, scribble a

236
00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:29.790
few more notes, play it
back in, and you just

237
00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:33.360
go around Lima. You know,
usually only with one real

238
00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.520
musical instrument. So most of
the people I work with

239
00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:39.000
at the time would have
just one keyboard or one

240
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.840
electric guitar in the room,
one Commodore 64 on one

241
00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:45.570
compiler. And it was just
started going around, you know,

242
00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:48.960
checking it. And like I
say, just maybe scoring it

243
00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:51.770
out. I think Rob Hubbard
was very fond of everything

244
00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:54.140
because I think he was
a stage musician. He was

245
00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:59.030
a, he was playing with
bands and he was very

246
00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:04.880
much a, a, a sight
reading musician. I was somewhere

247
00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:08.120
in between. I was studying
music and very interesting scoring

248
00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:11.480
music in, in the right
way and getting it in

249
00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:14.060
front of real musicians. But
at the same time, I

250
00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:18.620
just enjoyed the, the, the
exercise of writing it down

251
00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:21.860
by hand, entering it into
the compiler and firing into

252
00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:25.220
the 64 was a very
satisfying thing, you know? And

253
00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:26.540
then you've got a backup,
you know, you've got a

254
00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:29.210
backup on the score paper,
just in case you lose

255
00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:32.650
everything Who was the individual
that you just referenced, Rob,

256
00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:37.690
Rob Hubbard. So Rob was,
I'd have to say one

257
00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:41.680
of the very early pioneers
in, in making the Sid

258
00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:47.590
chip do extraordinary things and
play music. That was very

259
00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:53.620
sounded like real music shows
and like intended to, to

260
00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:59.350
insanity, to emulate real instruments
or close to that, you

261
00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:01.510
know, to give the feel
that there was a band

262
00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:04.180
playing. So there's a bass
guitar playing a bit of

263
00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:06.940
a drum ambulation thing going
on. So I think Rob

264
00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:11.260
Hubbard, Martin Galway at the
time were the two pioneers

265
00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:14.080
at the set Chet that
influenced all of us. And

266
00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:15.520
then I was on the,
I was only a young

267
00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:20.350
boy really when, when Martin
and Robert are around. But

268
00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:23.800
when I refer to earlier
hearing the sound that was

269
00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:26.770
possible to come out of
this scene that you had

270
00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:28.270
in the, in the corner
of your living room, away

271
00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:31.210
from your bedroom, these were
the guys that were, that

272
00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:33.790
were producing that sound. So
we knew they were called

273
00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:38.370
Rob Hubbard, Martin Galway, and
one or two others that,

274
00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:41.290
that stood out, but we
didn't know how they did

275
00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:44.560
it. You know, all we
have with the Commodore 64

276
00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:47.080
reference guide that you get
with the machine, how would

277
00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:49.450
you meet these people? Could
they teach you, could you

278
00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:50.950
sit down with them? Could
they show you how to

279
00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:54.240
do this? It was, it
was alchemy, it was complete

280
00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:56.710
wizardry and alchemy. It was,
it was a, it was

281
00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:59.500
as though it's completely out
of reach to your average

282
00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:02.710
school boy, who, or school
girl who wanted to go

283
00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:07.720
out and playing with, with
this instrument really. But yeah,

284
00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:10.210
pioneers, I mean, w without
those guys, I don't really

285
00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:13.030
know what would have happened.
It's hard to much in

286
00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:17.440
the Commodore and the early
video game music without Rob

287
00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:22.480
Martin, Rob is known for
the loading sequence of skater

288
00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:27.070
die. And because of, because
it had samples, so there

289
00:17:27.070 --> 00:17:28.960
was Sid music, but then
there's also a playback of

290
00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:32.500
samples. And I understand correctly,
the playback, the ability to

291
00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:37.580
play sampled audio was an,
was an exploit of, of

292
00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:39.490
a, of a bug in
the Sid that allowed that.

293
00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:45.880
Yeah. So the typical way
you'd achieve them is, is

294
00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:51.180
by sidestepping one of the,
that you commonly relied on

295
00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:55.260
to, to get the steady
sound. So again, anything running

296
00:17:55.260 --> 00:18:00.870
smoothly on a, on a
video playback device, such as

297
00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:05.430
a Commodore 64 or spectrum,
you're usually tied into the

298
00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:08.970
Rasta interrupt. So this is
the screen, the screen writing

299
00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:11.880
the beam, the Rasta beam
on the television, you know,

300
00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:16.170
that was like a, say,
60 Hertz. And the idea

301
00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:19.510
was to intro that at
some point to get a

302
00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:24.780
reliable clock speed, a routine
that would reliably fire, and

303
00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:27.240
then that would lead to
you being able to write

304
00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:31.350
music that would be consistent
and be in the right

305
00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:34.110
time and so on and
so forth. And there was

306
00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:35.910
an exploit in that you
could, you could have the

307
00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:38.250
rust or insert running, and
then something called a non

308
00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:44.550
Mascal interrupt, which you, you
run alongside it. And instead

309
00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:50.310
of sending the instructions to
the, the pitch registers or

310
00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:53.520
the envelope registers of the
situ, you'd send them straight

311
00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:56.540
to the volume registers and
you changed the you'd switched

312
00:18:56.540 --> 00:19:00.750
the volume on and off
so quickly that it would,

313
00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:03.450
you could play a sample
back because really a sample

314
00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:07.740
is just a sequence of
zeros and ones, you know,

315
00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:11.130
on and off really full
volume and zero volume. So

316
00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:15.720
you could, you could, you
could simulate a sample going

317
00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:21.630
through simultaneously. That's fantastic innovation.
So Rob was doing that

318
00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:23.550
quite early on. And so
it was Martin as well.

319
00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:26.580
Martin was doing that with,
I think arc annoyed was

320
00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:30.960
the first time he did
that. So brilliant stuff, those

321
00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:33.990
kinds of those kinds of
things, we, as the game,

322
00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:36.660
as the gamer is, would
be playing a game and

323
00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:41.010
then someone would hear a
voice speaking or, or, you

324
00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:44.130
know, music that sounded like
a real sample of something

325
00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:47.400
that would be the defining
moment in the game. I

326
00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:50.370
can't please. That just absolutely.
I know. And it would

327
00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:52.740
happen. I mean, if it
happened at that climax of

328
00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:54.180
the game as well, I
mean, that was even better.

329
00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:57.750
I remember a game called
while you probably remember impossible

330
00:19:57.750 --> 00:20:02.640
mission. Oh my goodness. Very,
yeah. Yeah. There were fantastic

331
00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:04.350
moments in that where you'd
fall down the hole and

332
00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:08.710
fall into this bottomless pit
or whatever. And because yell,

333
00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:12.720
scream come out on, the
robots would have this sort

334
00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:15.360
of, you know, sample playing.
But then at the climax

335
00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:17.160
of the game, you meet
the buddy, you know, he's

336
00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:21.180
a bond villain, as you
break into his, his lair,

337
00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:24.060
he just shouts no, no
like this. And it's just

338
00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:27.630
to have that as a
13, 14 year old kid,

339
00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:41.850
it's just absolutely extraordinary stuff
like that absolutely blew our

340
00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:44.310
minds. And it seems so
silly now, as we talk

341
00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:47.380
about how some gamers won't
play a game, unless it

342
00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:51.400
is a, you know, 60
frames, a second and 10

343
00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:54.970
ADP, or that's unacceptable, anything
less, you know what, isn't

344
00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:57.760
it strange because where's the
room for your own imagination

345
00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:00.400
to fill in those gaps,
right? So when you heard

346
00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:03.160
this Commodore 64 playing music,
you knew it wasn't real

347
00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:07.030
music, so to speak, you
knew it wasn't real instruments,

348
00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:11.170
but your imagination filled in
the blanks. You know, so

349
00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:13.120
it's a shame, isn't it?
That we've got 60 FPS

350
00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:17.140
games that, I mean, that
doesn't really mean a lot

351
00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:19.420
to me, it doesn't, the
game has to have some

352
00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:24.910
heart and some real something
that shines through that you

353
00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:29.440
can tell the developers weren't
were serious about. So simple

354
00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:32.620
games, somehow there was a
sense that there was, it

355
00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:35.770
was hard, you know, that
you didn't see it. It

356
00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:37.990
was used sparingly. If it
was easy, they would have

357
00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:41.380
done it through all, all
the games. That's true. I

358
00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:44.470
mean, that was usually a
memory limitation. Of course, for

359
00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:49.120
most of this stuff, sample
playback was in the early

360
00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:53.950
days. I remember, you know,
you would have everything would

361
00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:56.770
stop and then the sample
would play. So gameplay would

362
00:21:56.770 --> 00:22:00.520
be suspended in the sample
of sound. I mean, even,

363
00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:03.790
even a few days later
after things like impossible mission.

364
00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:06.820
When, for example, I think
a colleague of mine, Jonathan

365
00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:10.930
Donna ocean software wrote a
very nice piece of music

366
00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:13.510
for a game. I think
it was called Ronda Goldman

367
00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:16.990
on the Commodore 64 and
really good example of where

368
00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:20.140
he had a bass guitar
sample playing with drum samples.

369
00:22:21.490 --> 00:22:23.800
But you could only do
that on the title screen.

370
00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:26.140
You know, you could never
have that when your characters

371
00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:29.050
running around the screen or
whatever, are you shooting the

372
00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:32.350
aliens, you can't have that
because there's no time in

373
00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:35.620
the ER or in the
Rasta to do that. There's

374
00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:38.590
no processing time and there's
not enough memory either. So

375
00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:41.500
you play the music and
the title and that's it.

376
00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:43.180
That's all you can get.
So how long did you

377
00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:47.230
work for, for ocean software?
So I worked there for

378
00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:52.960
about, about four years in
total, from school leaving age

379
00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:59.890
up until 92. So yeah,
as I left school, you

380
00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:01.930
know, I was doing the,
the usual sort of computer

381
00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:04.320
science route and I was
going to university and wanted

382
00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:07.510
to head off into those
kinds of things. I remember

383
00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:10.630
going to a college and,
and the, the, the guy

384
00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:11.680
was saying, so what do
you, what do you want

385
00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:12.790
to do? Do you want
to come to the college

386
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.200
and learn this, this language
called C and C? Can

387
00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:19.600
I have a look at
some C? And he showed

388
00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:22.030
me this stuff. And I
thought last week I was

389
00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:23.950
sat with the guys at
ocean software and they were

390
00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:26.590
showing me 65 Oh two
assembly, and there were sprites

391
00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:29.500
flying around the screen. And
that was, sounds blaring. And,

392
00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:31.300
you know, there was a
joystick routine and everything, and

393
00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:33.400
it was, there was wonderful.
I don't know if I

394
00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:37.480
can come and learn. See,
I've seen, you know, Pandora's

395
00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:39.670
box has been open now.
I don't want to do

396
00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:42.010
that. I want to go
straight into to writing, to

397
00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:46.070
working with the games. So,
yeah, I learned loads from,

398
00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:48.560
from the guys at ocean
software. So four years in

399
00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:53.720
total and you know, a
lot of game titles, but

400
00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:55.490
most of all, really just
learning. There was a lot

401
00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:57.650
of time, you know, we
talk about Google time now

402
00:23:57.650 --> 00:23:59.120
and all this kind of
thing. There was a lot

403
00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:03.380
of time back then really
to innovate into, to try

404
00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:07.670
out new things. We have
countless routines, countless five and

405
00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:11.750
a quarter inch floppies flying
around lots of printouts as

406
00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:13.580
well. We used to print
out our code and share

407
00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:17.060
it code reviews with Donald
printed out and printed out

408
00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:19.700
a code, lots of stuff
like that. Going on lots

409
00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:23.270
of innovation that I'm still
seeing today, I'm still seeing

410
00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:25.910
in today's code, believe it
or not surprising, but it

411
00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:29.100
is true. I think. So
how much has that, that,

412
00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:33.390
that time and how you
programmed and composed music on

413
00:24:33.390 --> 00:24:36.860
the <inaudible> affected the music
that you do today? Is

414
00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:38.450
it something that you still
do or are you still

415
00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:42.860
thinking about it on a
daily basis? I think musically,

416
00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:48.500
perhaps less so than on
my I current commercial programming

417
00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:54.140
work, which is more oriented
towards more enterprise stuff. Really.

418
00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:57.290
I think when I come
into the studio, my music

419
00:24:57.290 --> 00:25:01.670
is, I mean, sometimes it's
influenced by the sound maybe

420
00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:07.610
of the, the eighties video
game era. But I, I

421
00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:11.170
mean, I, after, after working
on the video games, I

422
00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:13.580
got more into life, life
performance. I think once I

423
00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:16.610
started to get interested in,
in orchestral arrangements and things

424
00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:20.300
like that and study music,
I started to distance myself

425
00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:24.290
a little bit from, from
the electronic sound, but he's

426
00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:26.270
in recent years really that
I've gone back to it

427
00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:29.210
and started to bring out
the synthesizes again. And yeah,

428
00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:32.090
I do. I do feel
as an influence still there.

429
00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:34.820
I can't quite explain what
it is, but it does

430
00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:37.340
creep in, but more so
I think in the way

431
00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:43.070
that I work, like I
say, with my current present

432
00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:49.130
day programming career, that there
were certain things that seemed

433
00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:51.980
to creep up in the
consciousness as I'm working. And

434
00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:53.930
I remember how we did
things and perhaps a little

435
00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:57.290
bit more efficiently and with
less force and less ceremony

436
00:25:57.290 --> 00:26:00.290
and less fear and less
worry. And we just, you

437
00:26:00.290 --> 00:26:04.430
know, we just went out
and did the experiment. So

438
00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:07.970
there were fewer layers of
abstraction, or if any, there

439
00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:10.610
were fewer, there were fewer,
if you look at the,

440
00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:12.560
if you look at the
code and one of the

441
00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:14.630
first things that I did
when I saw that the

442
00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:18.620
ocean software music driver code
was to introduce a layer

443
00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:22.190
of abstraction, because I was
really interested in, in musical

444
00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:25.160
notes as they were written.
And as they were sounded

445
00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:30.890
by professional musicians. So C-sharp
is not the language, it's

446
00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:33.140
the a C sharp at
an F sharp and an

447
00:26:33.170 --> 00:26:36.500
E and G sharp and
so on. They were not

448
00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:40.970
expressed as, as that in
the code. So that would

449
00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:43.780
just come through as a,
as a 48 or, or

450
00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:49.140
283 or something like that.
So I raised the level

451
00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:52.890
of abstraction for my own
sanity, because I was just

452
00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:57.360
fed up writing notes as,
as numbers really. So I

453
00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:00.750
started to, to put macros
and various things into the

454
00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:05.520
code to, to fully express
what those notes meant. And

455
00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:08.070
also the, the durations. So
the durations were things like

456
00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:12.830
24 cycles. So 24 cycles
is close to a, a

457
00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:16.050
crotchet in musical terms played
at 120 beats per minute,

458
00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:18.870
for example. So you'd have
a, semiquaver a quaver and

459
00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:22.530
a crotch it, and a
24 would be, I think,

460
00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:25.560
the quaver or a crotch
it. So I started to,

461
00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:31.260
to, to use symbols in
the code to, to express

462
00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:33.690
those things because I thought
they were missing. So I

463
00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:35.670
had, I had a musical
language and I wanted to

464
00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:38.720
express it in the code
and the language didn't have

465
00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:41.370
those abstractions. So we just
had to make them, you

466
00:27:41.370 --> 00:27:44.520
know, and some of the
things happened with music routines

467
00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:47.870
as well, of course. So
there was no expression in

468
00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:50.880
the language of what a
bar was in music. So

469
00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:54.390
we have to, to introduce
that, you know, a bar

470
00:27:54.390 --> 00:27:58.650
or a measure, or a,
or a section of, of

471
00:27:58.650 --> 00:28:01.440
music, we try to bring
those obstructions into the code.

472
00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:03.780
It took a lot of
typing. You know, there was

473
00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:05.700
a lot of code to
go through a lot of

474
00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:08.640
assembly and a lot of
mnemonics and all sorts of

475
00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:12.810
weird aliases and stuff, but
we got there in the

476
00:28:12.810 --> 00:28:14.640
end. And then, you know,
when you had the music

477
00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:16.680
driver, the way you wanted
it, you knew that the

478
00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:19.440
next project that demanded, you
know, a high score tune

479
00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:22.980
or a level one tune
or whatever, you could get

480
00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:24.990
straight in there because you
could perhaps play on the

481
00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:27.510
piano, start in G minor
or something like that, or,

482
00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:31.140
or start with just a
simple sequence. And you could

483
00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:34.620
go straight to the ComPilot
and express that, yeah, there

484
00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:37.650
are parallels in, in my
current, they work in a

485
00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:41.790
way, I mean, this is
gonna sound ridiculous, right. But,

486
00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:44.160
you know, domain driven design
is something that I do,

487
00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:46.920
you know, with, with companies
that I work on, it's

488
00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:49.440
nothing at all to do
in music, but the way

489
00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:53.610
that you communicate with your
SMEs, with the business analysts

490
00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:55.950
and so on, it's very
important. And if you can

491
00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:59.600
have developers that are using
a similar language and half

492
00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:02.610
that ability to ability to
be abstract, and at the

493
00:29:02.610 --> 00:29:06.210
same time be detailed, then
you get really fantastic combination.

494
00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:08.220
So we were doing that
back then, but in a

495
00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:12.980
different way, I think it
is true though, Like how

496
00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:15.380
long I've been doing this
and the older that I

497
00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:18.710
get, the more I'm becoming
the get off my lawn

498
00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:23.210
person. You know, I thought
what I was doing in

499
00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:26.150
like the early nineties was
revolutionary, but it was repeating

500
00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:28.070
what people had figured out
in the sixties, which was

501
00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:32.540
repeating with peer people, figure
it out. Yeah, I know.

502
00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:35.180
It's, it's incredible. And I
mean, we found some really

503
00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:38.900
old code as well in
the ocean archives and still

504
00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:40.700
innovation was that, you know,
we're talking about all the

505
00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:45.100
things that games could do,
like scrolling, multicolor, scrolling, multidirectional,

506
00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:50.110
scrolling, Sprite, multiplexing, some of
these ideas, you know, a

507
00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:52.720
lot of it came from
arcade machines as well, because

508
00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:54.820
a lot of these arcade
machines run on 65 Oh

509
00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:59.050
two chips, or is that
80 chips? So, you know,

510
00:29:59.050 --> 00:30:00.850
it was already there. It
wasn't, you just have to

511
00:30:00.850 --> 00:30:03.160
know where to look. It's
really hard to know who

512
00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:06.820
to talk to. When was
this information, like I said

513
00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:09.040
earlier, it was, it was,
it was really very well

514
00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:12.130
hidden information. You had to
go and meet the hackers,

515
00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:15.970
meet the guys behind the,
the games. It was a

516
00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:18.940
very hard place to start
from early. You didn't have

517
00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:24.520
any, any example code, any
frameworks, any, you know, stack

518
00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:29.470
overflow. This is nothing, you
know, so yeah, I do

519
00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:31.900
feel the same as you.
I think sometimes that, you

520
00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:34.150
know, we've solved this problem
before. I don't want to

521
00:30:34.150 --> 00:30:37.150
be solving this problem again,
I'm getting a bit irritated

522
00:30:37.150 --> 00:30:39.850
to this, but, but then
you're got to have the

523
00:30:39.850 --> 00:30:42.550
patients, you know, when you're
trying to bring this to

524
00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:46.270
a new, some new teams,
for example, there's a time

525
00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:48.730
for, there's a time for
reflection and there's a time

526
00:30:48.730 --> 00:30:52.240
for, you know, just let
people get on with it

527
00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:54.160
and make, make their own
mistakes and stuff like that

528
00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:57.490
and find out it's good
though. It's one of my

529
00:30:57.490 --> 00:31:00.160
favorite things is actually working
with junior developers and just

530
00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:03.880
letting them, let them loose
this. Fantastic. Well, I really

531
00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:05.770
appreciate you chatting with me
today. And I want to

532
00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:08.590
tell folks that who understand
that this show is only

533
00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:11.230
30 minutes long and Matthew
and I had a great

534
00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:13.180
chat before the show, and
we're going to do something

535
00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:16.870
longer and more in depth
with more discussion and more

536
00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:19.030
music in the future. So
you're going to want to

537
00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:22.360
watch for that. But I
think as we end this

538
00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:26.320
episode, we will end it
on the ocean. Loader music.

539
00:31:27.550 --> 00:31:30.520
You can certainly find online,
but that will splice in

540
00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:32.980
right here. Thanks so much,
Matthew. You're welcome. Thank you.

541
00:31:33.630 --> 00:32:15.810
