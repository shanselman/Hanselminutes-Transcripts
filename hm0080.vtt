In this episode, Scott and
Carl discussed Vista 64. Hi,

9
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.680
this is Carl Franklin. You're listening
to Hansel minutes from handsome

10
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.380
and it's dot com. Scott
and I are here and

11
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.690
you're here. That means we
can get started. Hey Scott.

12
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:19.620
Hello, sir. Vista 64 Vista
64 Vista 64. People are

13
00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.930
afraid of it. It's a,
it's a whole new world.

14
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.900
You got 32 extra bits
and it's very frightening. Now

15
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.570
you've been running 64 for
awhile, right? Can I tell

16
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.930
you something? I have only
run well, that's not true

17
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.320
on my desktop. I have
only run Vista 64. I

18
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.800
don't want on top. I
installed this to 32, but

19
00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.960
64 ran better than 32.
Okay. But would it be

20
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.030
fair to say your initial
experience with this to 64

21
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.160
was not positive? No, exactly.
So I think what happened

22
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.410
was that the, the people
who would be the most

23
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.990
likely to use 64 were
the first people to install

24
00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.000
it. And those are the
people who installed it the

25
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.900
day that it came out.
And there's nothing about 50

26
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.420
to 64. That is any
money, any more of a

27
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.830
problem than 32, except for
drivers. Right? Of course drivers

28
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.110
are the first, they're the
first thing to be, to

29
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.970
be not done. I'm afraid.
So initial experiences out of

30
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.900
box experience, they call that
a Microsoft, Oop, Oh, be

31
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.070
the out-of-box experience with VIX
Vista 64 was lousy. And

32
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.930
I think you had some
of those problems yourself. I

33
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.430
did. I'm using, you know,
audio drivers for not just

34
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.400
your standard consumer audio, but
pro audio systems from Mark

35
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.950
of the unicorn. And they
took a while to come

36
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.140
out. And not only that,
but I had a raid

37
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.550
Stripe that, that took awhile
to come out and the

38
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.790
drivers for motu still aren't
that good. I mean, I'm

39
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.530
still finding that I go
to record and the audio

40
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.310
device isn't there and I
have to reboot the audio

41
00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.590
device, turn it off, turn
it back on for those

42
00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:01.200
drivers to come back. So
this is which device, This

43
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.930
is a Mark of the
unicorn, M O T U

44
00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.620
or motu. And the model
is 24 IO, which is

45
00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.330
basically 24 balanced inputs and
outputs. Okay. So as a,

46
00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.510
as a non audio file,
what I heard you say

47
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.060
was this is a blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah thing.

48
00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.490
I've never heard of blah,
blah, blah, unstable drivers. Yeah,

49
00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.610
that's right. Basically. That's exactly
it. It's a, it's a

50
00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.480
pro audio rig and it
took a while for the,

51
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.190
for the drivers to come
out. It also took a

52
00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.650
while for the Ray drivers
to come out for the,

53
00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:34.890
at Korea. Is that how
you say a Rica? A

54
00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.650
Cray? Yeah. It's a red
card that I have in

55
00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.840
there. Okay. It took a
while for that to happen

56
00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.460
too. It took a lot
longer, actually. So basically it

57
00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.410
all comes down to the
drivers. And this is, this

58
00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.690
has been my experience with,
with this 64 and Jeff

59
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.210
Atwood did a great job
of helping me get my

60
00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:54.510
super machine hooked up. We
tried to pick name brand

61
00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.280
stuff. And that's why I
was teasing you about the,

62
00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.550
the V the sound card,
because, you know, I've never

63
00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.470
heard of that company. I'm
sure that they're lovely. And

64
00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.680
amongst sound card companies, they're
probably the greatest sound card

65
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.350
in the universe. Yeah. Not
consumer grade pro grade. Okay.

66
00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.620
Exactly. Pro great stuff, but
it all still comes down

67
00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.360
to that, that driver stuff.
So you've got to get

68
00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.030
all those coders up to
speed. They've got to test

69
00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.400
the hell out of it
and they've got to get

70
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.800
it signed. Right. Was it
as it was assigned driver

71
00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:22.920
That's right. All the 64
drive bit drivers have to

72
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:27.000
be signed. And, you know,
that's something that even XP

73
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.600
32 driver makers never bothered
to do. If you ever

74
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.690
noticed a you're installing something
and you get the infamous

75
00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.540
style log that says warning,
this driver is not signed.

76
00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.970
We don't know if it's
actually valid because nobody bothered

77
00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.030
to do it. Yeah. Because
you're basically just trusting them

78
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.860
and it's one extra step.
It just happens to be

79
00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.560
a step they don't worry
about. Sometimes you'll see a

80
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.060
installation program say just before
the dialogue pops up, Hey,

81
00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.100
a scary dialogue is going
to happen. Trust us. And

82
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.290
push. Yes. And that's their,
that's the equivalent to them

83
00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.990
signing it. Exactly. Yeah. So
I've just right. Clicked on

84
00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.260
computer management. And I'm clicking
on the device manager to

85
00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.930
take a look at some
of the devices that I've

86
00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.820
got here. I've got an
Nvidia G-Force 8,600 GTS. I've

87
00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:13.290
got the Nvidia serial ATA
controller. So my motherboard is

88
00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.950
a controller that is using
the Nvidia chip set. And

89
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:18.930
that this was all kind
of part of Jeff's master

90
00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.700
plan, because I said that
I needed this thing to

91
00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.380
be fast as possible, but
I need it to be

92
00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.810
stable. I just can't have
this thing blue screen. So

93
00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:28.650
I don't want to go
and fight with some funky

94
00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.500
driver that I'm not used
to. So it's got a

95
00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:36.090
very, very, very standard chip
set. It's got a very,

96
00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.520
very standard and supportive video
card, you know, really, if

97
00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.370
you're not using Nvidia or
ATI video cards, what are

98
00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:46.050
you using? Things like the
FireWire, they're all the standard,

99
00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.990
you know, via chips and
stuff like that. You know,

100
00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.840
even the monitors I picked
all Dell all the same.

101
00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.140
I just want everything clean.
I just did not want.

102
00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:59.060
And then the, the networking
controllers and, and force. So

103
00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:03.740
this really minimize my exposure
to mix mixing and matching

104
00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.950
drivers. Right. We've just got
the Nvidia chip set for

105
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:11.360
the networking controller for the
SJTA stuff. The, the sound

106
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.570
controller is a, is a,
is a basic controller comes

107
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.390
and shows up in, in
Vista here as a high

108
00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:20.270
definition audio device. It's so
it's so boring and plain,

109
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.410
and I haven't had really
great experience with, with Vista

110
00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:29.240
64. Haven't had any problems.
Although I have heard a

111
00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.300
number of people because they're
getting four gigs of Ram

112
00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:36.170
or more on their machines
have really, really slow installs.

113
00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:39.170
Apparently there are a couple
of motherboards that have got

114
00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:43.430
a bit of a firmware
bug where during the installation

115
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:48.050
period, they'll blue screen, not
sure why, and almost universally

116
00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.410
I've heard, if you just
dropped down to two gigs

117
00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:54.230
of Ram, take out a
sticker too, for the installation

118
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:56.720
and then put them back
in. You're fine. Something's going

119
00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.670
on during the setup process?
I don't know if you

120
00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:02.320
had that issue as well.
I have eight gigs of

121
00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.980
Ram and I didn't have
a slow setup. In fact,

122
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.030
the setup was one of
the more painless setups that

123
00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:14.290
I've ever had. Although I
did have the experience, you

124
00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:17.140
know, when Vista boots it,
if it's got a network

125
00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:21.250
connection, I believe it's, it
goes out and tries to

126
00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:24.820
install updates before it boots.
Yeah. Looking for drivers and

127
00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:29.020
things like that. Right. So,
which is very cool. And

128
00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:32.530
it took a really long
time in the beginning to

129
00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:34.390
get it up and running.
In fact, I thought it

130
00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:36.730
was hung. So I would
just, I just left it

131
00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:38.920
go overnight and came back
in in the morning and

132
00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:42.850
it was at the prompt.
That's cool. And it also

133
00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:45.490
did something nice if it's
at the prompt and waiting

134
00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:49.570
for you to log in,
it powers down powers down

135
00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:51.370
the machine. So when you
come back in, you turn

136
00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:53.980
on the machine, boom, it's
right up. Yeah. This is

137
00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:56.410
an interesting thing to point
out. Now. I, it may

138
00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:59.020
be just Vista specific, but
I have had really great

139
00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.810
experiences with, with X 64.
I can't speak about this

140
00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:05.350
being 64 or X 86,
but as far as hibernate

141
00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:08.020
and sleep, it really, it
really works. Now you can

142
00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:09.730
actually put a machine to
sleep and it will come

143
00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:11.740
back. And I believe it
has to do with just

144
00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:15.490
the firmware. It has to
do that. I know. What

145
00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:20.710
is that called ACPI? Yeah.
The power control system, Power

146
00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:24.310
management spec for firmware. I
think it's like ACPI level

147
00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:27.040
two or something like that
have had really great experiences

148
00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.800
with the machine, not falling
asleep and dying. You know,

149
00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.980
how sometimes machines tend to
die in their sleep when

150
00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:35.710
it comes to windows. One
of the things that I've

151
00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:38.620
been monitoring and this particular
machine more than I did

152
00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:41.440
on any other Vista machine
is the reliability and performance

153
00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.790
monitor. I don't know if
you've done that. Have you

154
00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:44.440
seen this? Are you in
front of a Vista machine

155
00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:47.480
now? Not in front of
a Vista machine. Now You

156
00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.200
go to your Vista machine
and you type in reliability,

157
00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:54.400
not you, but everybody else
you'll get the perf Mon.

158
00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:56.790
And then the perf on
the left side, there, there's

159
00:08:56.790 --> 00:09:00.120
actually a reliability monitor. And
this is a really great

160
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.420
little kind of not hidden,
but certainly not advertised thing

161
00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:07.050
about Vista. And it's got
a system stability chart and

162
00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:10.650
it tracks five different aspects
of the system, software installs

163
00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:15.690
and uninstalls application failures, hardware
failures, windows failures, and miscellaneous

164
00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:17.550
failures. And then it gives
you a one to 10

165
00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:22.860
about how stable your system
is. So looking at my

166
00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:27.390
system from when I first
installed it in July 21st, I

167
00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:30.270
can click on that date
on this scrolling chart. And

168
00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:32.220
I can see all the
different things that I installed

169
00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:35.610
for that day drivers and
everything had no failures at

170
00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:41.850
all from the 21st of July until
the 2nd of August. And I can

171
00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:44.160
see that I had a
system stability rating of 10,

172
00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:47.460
and then I'm going along
and going along. And then

173
00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:51.540
I see an X here
where, mm actually knows his

174
00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:55.410
enemy, MMC dot exe crashed.
So then that lowered my

175
00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:57.420
stability rating. Cause you can
only get a stability rating

176
00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:00.600
of 10, if nothing crashes.
That means nothing at all.

177
00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:03.270
Okay. So when I go
and go and I go,

178
00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:07.440
and then I had, what
was this one? Dev dev

179
00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.740
em. So I was running
a beta version of the

180
00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:14.340
developer environment and I had
that dye and it lowered

181
00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:16.950
my stability rating. And then
those stability ratings go back

182
00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:21.150
up as fewer things crash
to make sense. So I've

183
00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:23.790
had no hardware failures at
all that entire row is

184
00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:29.640
blank. Nothing has gone wrong.
We had one miscellaneous failure

185
00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.980
says disruptive shut down. The
computer was not shut down

186
00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:35.400
properly. And this was because
one of my ups has

187
00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:38.370
failed. So it keeps track
of all those different things.

188
00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:40.230
And it keeps track of
what you installed on what

189
00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:43.470
day. And it really gave
me a lot of insight

190
00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:45.210
and some of the background
things I can go back

191
00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:48.240
and see the date that
a particular KB was installed.

192
00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:51.600
I can see when I
installed my, my wireless keyboard

193
00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:54.780
and things like that right
now, I've got a stability

194
00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:58.320
index of 6.3 and it's
climbing because I've installed a

195
00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.990
bunch of new stuff in
the last couple of days

196
00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:02.670
that I've been playing around
with some of the betas

197
00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:05.850
and whatnot, but it has
been a really, really useful

198
00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:08.340
thing. And I would encourage
people to, to look at

199
00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:11.550
the stability charts under the
reliability monitor on their existing

200
00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:15.180
Vista machines and then compare
it to their Vista 64

201
00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:18.800
machines. And I haven't had
any problems. S S P

202
00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.840
one just came out or
it was at a beta

203
00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:23.030
of S P one that
just came out. So B

204
00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:25.730
beta invitations for SB. One
just came out. If you

205
00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:28.610
were in on the wind
30 on the windows server

206
00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:32.000
system, 2003 beta or a
number of other betas, you

207
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.710
may have received an email
from connect.microsoft.com saying that you

208
00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:40.850
could opt in to the,
the, the beta for the

209
00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:45.170
service pack for Vista. Yeah.
Okay. So they're saying it'll

210
00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:48.830
probably be, I think they
announced January, February next, next

211
00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:53.560
year. I don't know about
you, but if running a

212
00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:57.610
Vista machine for a mission
critical, I'm not going to

213
00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:01.290
install betas of services. Yeah.
I think that the idea

214
00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:02.520
of a beta of a
service pack, it's just not

215
00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:04.320
something that I'm willing to
do. Certainly not a machine

216
00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:05.670
that I need. I mean,
I need this machine to

217
00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:08.130
be up all the time.
So, but at the same

218
00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:10.410
time, I think, you know,
and then this is just

219
00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:12.450
an early adopter speaking, but
I think it's silly to

220
00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:16.320
not, to not install it
now. I mean, if, if

221
00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.660
your drivers are available, the
idea of, well, I'll wait,

222
00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:21.750
I'll wait for service pack
one, right? People are saying

223
00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:24.060
that because they think that
it's obviously not ready for

224
00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:27.090
prime time today, but it'll,
you know, it'll be ready

225
00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:30.120
later and it doesn't quite,
it doesn't quite work like

226
00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:31.860
that. You know how this
milk is bad. Maybe it'll

227
00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:33.600
be better later. I'll put
it back in the fridge.

228
00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:36.540
You know, it's, it's an
ongoing thing. You've got Tuesday

229
00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:39.600
patches that come out all
the time. Remember just last

230
00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.630
week, there were two new
hotfixes for Vista that fixed

231
00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:47.160
the long copy times problem.
Yeah. Made a huge difference.

232
00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:49.740
The long copy time problem
was a real irritant Vista

233
00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:52.770
where if you were copying
a very large file, it

234
00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:54.780
would spend all this time
calculating how long it would

235
00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:57.810
take and a lot less
time copying. And you'd get

236
00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:01.440
these really low bit rates
when copying large files across

237
00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:05.400
the network. Right. You'd get
a hang on calculating, remaining

238
00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:08.370
time when it gets to
99% and hang there for

239
00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:12.030
a long time. Yeah. Huge
irritant fixed. So one of

240
00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:13.650
the things I think people
kind of forget about is

241
00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:15.360
that service pack one is
going to be a roll

242
00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:16.950
up of a lot of
these things. There are going

243
00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:20.260
to add some stuff in
service pack one, but it's,

244
00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.220
it's not like it's going
to be a massively different

245
00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:26.640
from the ongoing patched version
of something. So it's kind

246
00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:28.950
of something to think about.
The other thing I know

247
00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:33.990
about Vista from talking to
Richard, Richard Campbell, cohost of Dutton

248
00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:36.450
and rocks, you know who
I'm talking about. He, he

249
00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:42.540
discovered a problem with the
TCP IP V six stack

250
00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:48.480
that interferes with the networking
for IPV four, which is

251
00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:52.440
what most, everybody in the
world uses. So, and that

252
00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:56.220
can cause network slow down.
It can cause a hanging.

253
00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:01.020
And the, the solution is
to just disable IP. You

254
00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:03.360
know, that there's a there's
problems with Firefox right now

255
00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:06.810
when it comes to debugging
under visual studio and also

256
00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:10.190
disabling IPV six makes, makes
things better. You know, if

257
00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:14.400
you're not using IPV six.
Yeah. I pretty much disabled

258
00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:16.110
anything that I'm not using.
If I can, if I

259
00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:19.080
can get away with it.
Yeah. There should be out

260
00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:22.260
there. You know how you,
we have batch files that

261
00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:25.290
we pass around the RD,
RDS, pass them around there.

262
00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:28.260
Sure. You know how to
turn off or shut off

263
00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:32.220
all non-critical Yeah. I've got
one called clean processes dot

264
00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:34.710
bad. I run it before
I give a presentation. Exactly.

265
00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:37.110
Because net stop shuts down
the stuff I don't need

266
00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:39.180
for a presentation. So do
you have one for Vista

267
00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:42.720
as well? You know, I
don't, because so far there

268
00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:44.760
hasn't been anything I didn't
need to have running, you

269
00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:47.700
know, this machine doesn't have
wireless, so I don't have

270
00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:50.190
to shut down the wireless
zero configuration. Yeah. That'd be

271
00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:53.840
a nice PowerShell script. Huh?
It would just call net

272
00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:56.000
net shut down and net
service. But I've been running

273
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.980
this thing almost like a
server. I keep it really,

274
00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:00.020
really clean. I had, like
I had said, when I

275
00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:03.140
blogged about the initial purchase
that I wasn't going to

276
00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:05.420
pollute this thing at all.
Let me see if I

277
00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:07.130
look at my virtual machines
here. If I bring up

278
00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:10.250
my VMs, it's like, we
woke up at seven VMs

279
00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:12.650
right now. Yeah. You were
telling me this at the,

280
00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:15.130
at my birthday party, actually
that you use Vista just

281
00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:19.030
as a launching platform for
virtual machines and 64 V

282
00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:21.460
64 is perfect for that.
And that's, that's one of

283
00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:24.130
the whole reasons that I
use the 64 bit operating

284
00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:27.220
systems in general is because
you know, working in VMs

285
00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:30.370
is really fast. When you
have a memory, when you

286
00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:33.250
have a Ram available With
four gigs of Ram, my

287
00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:37.600
ex PVM, again, running on
an external hard drive is

288
00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.920
at least as fast, if
not faster than my, my

289
00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:42.760
old Pentium four, which is
really cool. So I'm looking

290
00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:47.890
here, I've got one, two,
three windows XP VMs. I've

291
00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:49.750
got one that I put
all my crazy tools in.

292
00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:51.370
If I'm going to test
the tool, I'll test it

293
00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:53.380
in a VM now, because
of course you can just

294
00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:56.800
drag the tool directly from
the bookstore onto the VM.

295
00:15:56.890 --> 00:15:59.950
At that sounds like a
silly, silly feature to tout.

296
00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:01.750
But the fact that I
could just drag and drop

297
00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:03.490
onto the surface of the
VM and copy of file

298
00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:07.480
PC or using virtual PC,
I understand that VMware is

299
00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:10.180
a little bit faster, but
I really dislike virtual PCs

300
00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:11.740
is simple. It's out of
the way I don't sweat

301
00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:16.120
it. Yeah. I've got a
fresh windows XP service pack.

302
00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:19.840
Two that I do testing
on application that needs to

303
00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:21.970
run on a, on a
fresh machine, got a windows

304
00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:24.850
98 machines. So I can
talk my Newton. I've got

305
00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:26.530
a copy of who Boone
two that I've been playing

306
00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:31.870
with mano and Moonlight. The
Silverlight for Linux got a

307
00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:34.570
rails VM. So this is
one for doing just Ruby

308
00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:38.230
on rails. And then I've
got an old, when this

309
00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:39.940
is actually still, I don't
actually use this VM, but

310
00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:44.680
it's, it's basically a dash
6.2 windows 3.1 VM, use

311
00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:46.630
it for games, you know,
just cause it's fun to

312
00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:49.330
see running sounds so I
don't actually use it. So

313
00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:51.340
not seven. I've actually got
six. And then I've got

314
00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:53.890
that. When that a 3.1,
one thing though that I

315
00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:55.780
did do that I didn't
expect I would was I

316
00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:57.940
didn't sell a couple of
games on the thing I

317
00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:00.160
had said I was gonna
keep it really clean, but

318
00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:03.910
I installed a Guild Wars
works great. And one thing

319
00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:07.690
I was actually pleasantly surprised
that I installed steam steam

320
00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:11.200
of course, is the half-life
two game launcher. Half-life two

321
00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:14.110
has a 64 bit process.
If you run it once

322
00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:16.240
it re it notices that
you're on a 64 bit

323
00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:19.450
machine and then downloads the
64 bit version of half

324
00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:21.910
flight too. And you can
tell when a process is

325
00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:25.300
64 bit, by going into
the windows task manager, clicking

326
00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:29.860
on the processes tab and
any process that is a

327
00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:34.360
32 bit process has an
asterick 32 by it. And

328
00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:37.270
then anything that's a 64
bit process doesn't have that.

329
00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:41.500
So I watched the HL
two half-life two dot exe

330
00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:46.480
switch from a 32 bit
processor, 64 bit processor, so

331
00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:48.610
I can use memory more
effectively. And then it also

332
00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:50.700
one of things that's nice
about the steam engine and

333
00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:53.040
the half flight two engine
is that it uses all

334
00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:56.370
four processors on a quad
proc Jeff Atwood over at

335
00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:59.970
coding. horror.com has got a
great article this week about,

336
00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:03.270
do you actually get a
speed increase with dual core

337
00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:05.850
versus quad core? And it
really comes down to whether

338
00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:07.860
or not the application was
written to a, to do

339
00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:11.030
that. Well, Scott, speaking of
nonsequitors, I got a story

340
00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:15.380
for you. So I have
two machines here that I

341
00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:20.060
recently bought for the new
studio for my two editors,

342
00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:24.880
Lawrence Ryan, and Brandon wen who
work on the shows here,

343
00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:28.880
Paul productions. So I decided
to get all the parts

344
00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:31.400
from new egg and put
them together, which is something

345
00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:33.800
I like to do. I,
you know, I went in

346
00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:36.680
phases. I started out in
life loving to build machines.

347
00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:38.630
And then for a while
there, it was just a

348
00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:40.150
nightmare and I didn't want
to deal with it. And

349
00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:43.280
now I'm back to liking
it again. But so I

350
00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:45.680
put these machines together and
we fired them up and

351
00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:48.170
they started using them and
they were blue screening. And

352
00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:51.380
that's when we started talking
about doing a blue screen

353
00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:54.590
debugging show on DNR TV.
And I thought, Oh, how

354
00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:57.380
fortuitous is this? Let's do
this. Saw one of them

355
00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:59.600
blue screen in the wild.
I watched it. Yeah. Right.

356
00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:02.150
So, and, and the blue
screens got more and more

357
00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:06.890
frequent. And we, I actually
looked up the codes and

358
00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:10.370
they were just completely random
one. There was three codes

359
00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:13.670
that it was blue screening
with. One was unknown error,

360
00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:19.010
which is always fun. And
the other is some obscure

361
00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:21.410
error that when you look
it up on the website

362
00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:24.680
on Microsoft's website, it says
something like, you know, millions

363
00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:28.010
of things could cause this,
Right? Yeah. So at this

364
00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:30.500
point you can't trust your
machine, right? This is the

365
00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:32.840
thing about blue screens, right?
It's like fine. It's eye

366
00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:34.730
catching your wife, cheating on
you. You know, you just,

367
00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:37.430
you can never trust them
again. My machine is as

368
00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:41.570
hard as failed. No, not
my wife. I'm just saying

369
00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:46.160
that my wife cheating on
you. Wait a second, wait

370
00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:48.020
a second. Now what I'm
saying is that when, when

371
00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:52.340
a machine blue screens, it's,
it's a violation of your

372
00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:55.340
trust. You put your trust
into the mr. Machine. Well,

373
00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:58.190
there's that too, but I'm
thinking more philosophically, right? I

374
00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:01.070
know. Yeah, you're right. You
can't trust the machine. So

375
00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:04.460
if it blue screens, once
in a, in a few

376
00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:06.590
months, you might chalk it
up to a bug, but

377
00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:09.980
if it blue screens fairly
regularly, you're thinking, okay, there's

378
00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:12.920
a problem. So this is
a very interesting story and

379
00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:16.280
I'll share it with you.
So weird things were happening

380
00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:20.780
on these machines. Like a
video was not refreshing on

381
00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:22.760
the desktop and you could
take a window and move

382
00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:24.830
it all around the desktop
and it would leave trails.

383
00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:27.890
That was one thing that
would happen. Randomly. Another thing

384
00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:30.800
that would happen was one
of the guys would go

385
00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:33.170
to do a mix down
from, which is when you

386
00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:36.020
take all the multiple, multiple
tracks that are happening all

387
00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:38.240
at once with different pan
and volume settings and all

388
00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:41.390
that. And you combine them
into a single stereo track.

389
00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:46.010
And in, in a portion
of the mixdown where you

390
00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:50.350
would expect, see a conversation,
there was just pink noise,

391
00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:55.990
which is just like every
frequency, just complete random noise.

392
00:20:57.010 --> 00:21:00.220
And for, for a serious
block of a chunk of

393
00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:02.760
it, That sounds like it
sounds like just memory just

394
00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:05.160
dumped itself into it, into
a file. Well, that's exactly

395
00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.930
what gave me that hint
that I thought it was

396
00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:08.970
memory because it looked like
it just got the wrong

397
00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:12.420
address somewhere and, or the
memory was corrupt in. And

398
00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:15.990
so I'm thinking it was
Ram swap the Ram out.

399
00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:19.650
So I, I didn't swap
the Ram out. I, the

400
00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:22.350
first thing I did was
I went to back to

401
00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:25.980
new egg and I looked
at the comments that people

402
00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:29.220
leave for the products that
they buy. Ah, one of

403
00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:31.650
the greatest things ever done.
It was for the motherboard.

404
00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:34.650
I checked for the motherboard.
And that was the first

405
00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:37.920
thing I checked. And the
comments for the first guy

406
00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:41.910
said, pros, good motherboard, blah,
blah, blah cons. I had

407
00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:48.210
to manually adjust the SPD
settings and manually tweak it

408
00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:51.960
to get this board stable.
Now what the SPD settings

409
00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:54.120
are, some sort of a
nuke probably know more about

410
00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:57.390
this, but it's like a
speed matching for the Ram.

411
00:21:57.390 --> 00:21:59.460
It's like a multiplier for
the Ram to get it

412
00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:02.970
to sync correctly to the
motherboard. Is that correct? Yep.

413
00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:07.170
Yeah. And so it's set
to auto in the bios,

414
00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:09.990
right? And then there's a
couple other options starting from

415
00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:17.520
2.0, to 3.3 to 2.5,
right? Yeah. Yeah. SPD is

416
00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:20.820
a basically it's good sculpt
serial presence detect. And it's,

417
00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:23.340
it's a little tiny EEPROM
that's on the memory module

418
00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:25.980
itself. And it keeps track
of all the speed information

419
00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:29.340
about the, about that memory.
And you use programs there's

420
00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:33.150
different Ram Ram checking program
that you can use. And

421
00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:36.150
if you have the wrong
data in that SPD systems

422
00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:39.690
will crash. Typically it's not
something you're supposed to have

423
00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:42.390
to change. Right. It's supposed
to, the motherboard is supposed

424
00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:44.490
to use that data to
configure the access to the

425
00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:47.460
memory module. Exactly. The module
is supposed to come programmed

426
00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:50.310
correctly. So that's very odd.
So before I went and

427
00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:52.350
tweaked it, because I don't
want to tweak things to

428
00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:55.860
that, know what I'm doing.
I downloaded the Microsoft Ram

429
00:22:55.860 --> 00:23:00.750
tester, the memory test or
utility from Microsoft, Microsoft specific

430
00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:03.990
utility. Yeah. Microsoft specific utility,
you download it. You Buddhist,

431
00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:07.290
you make a boot CD
rom or floppy. My case

432
00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:10.290
was CD rom it boots
up and it just exercises

433
00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:12.930
Ram. And it tells you
how many failures, how many

434
00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:14.850
passes. And it just keeps
running until you press a

435
00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:20.430
key. And within the first
minute failure, failure, failure, failure.

436
00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:23.730
Well, so I went and
I set the SPD setting

437
00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:27.540
to the second highest value.
And at first I set

438
00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:29.820
it to the lowest value
and that worked. Then I

439
00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:32.640
set it to the second
highest value thinking, well, you

440
00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:34.980
know, the highest one is
probably giving me the problem.

441
00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:37.350
I'll try the second highest.
Right. She just backed it

442
00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:40.050
off a notch. It's almost
like when there were problems

443
00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:42.690
with video drivers and you
would go to that performance

444
00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:45.000
slider and you'd pull it
back one that's it well

445
00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:48.080
worked. So, and you have
no problems. I haven't had

446
00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:49.730
a problem since I haven't
had a problem since they've

447
00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:52.460
been humming along for a
week and a half. Wow.

448
00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:55.160
That's, that's obscure. How is
anyone supposed to figure that

449
00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:57.170
out? You know, exactly. If
that guy hadn't left a

450
00:23:57.170 --> 00:24:00.470
comment on a, a newegg.com
I would been, I would've

451
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:04.310
probably sent them back, you
know, or tried to, I

452
00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:06.740
think you've pegged on one
of the really, really valuable

453
00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:11.330
things about, about the internet
specifically for buying hardware. If

454
00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:14.000
you're going to build your
own machine, don't just take

455
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.840
the recommendations of friends or
me or whoever. But look

456
00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:19.730
at the comments, you know,
especially if you've got a

457
00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:24.230
hundred plus comments about a
piece of hardware, such a

458
00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:27.680
fountain of information can be
found in, in sites like

459
00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:30.200
new egg sites, like Amazon,
where they allow someone to

460
00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:32.780
have a review and more
and more people are doing

461
00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:35.150
their reviews in that format,
pros and cons pros. You

462
00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:37.460
know, here's, what's great. Here's,
what's not allowing you to

463
00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:41.330
make a really educated decision
about it. And we tried

464
00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:43.310
to do that when I
put together this machine, because

465
00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:45.830
you know, with a Dell,
they're going to be a

466
00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:48.350
little more conservative. They're going
to put together a series

467
00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:51.740
of components. Some Dell made
some purchased that are going

468
00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:54.800
to give you a good
experience, but a conservative experience.

469
00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:57.890
We wanted to go a
little, a little beyond that,

470
00:24:57.950 --> 00:25:00.080
but you know, I don't
know if this motherboard is

471
00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:02.000
going to hate that memory,
which is going to hate

472
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.570
that video card. So that's
perfect. So you didn't have

473
00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:07.190
to just swap you didn't
just swap memory by new

474
00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:10.850
memory. It was just a
setup. Well, it was like

475
00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:13.460
it was happening on both
machines and they had the

476
00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:16.970
same kind of Ram, same
kind of everything. And yeah,

477
00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:19.700
the motherboard was the first
place I looked just so

478
00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:22.370
happened. That was it. Fantastic.
Well, Scott, I think that's

479
00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:25.100
a show. I think that's
a show. Alright. It's been

480
00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:28.190
a pleasure as always. Alright,
I'll see you next week

481
00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:30.440
and that's for you. Dear
listener. We'll see you next

482
00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:32.180
time on Hansel minutes.
