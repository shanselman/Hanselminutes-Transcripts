00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:09.120
monitoring platform for cloud infrastructure,
applications, and logs metrics, all

3
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.360
in one place from their
recent report on serverless, adoption

4
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.810
and trends. Datadog found half
their customer base using ECE

5
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:20.100
twos have now adopted AWS
Lambda. They've examined real world

6
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.130
serverless usage by thousands of
companies running on millions of

7
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.700
distinct serverless functions. And they
found that half of the

8
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.150
Lambda invocations run for less
than 800 milliseconds, you can

9
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.330
easily monitor all your serverless
functions in one place and

10
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.290
generate serverless metrics straight from
Datadog. Check it out yourself

14
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.610
is Scott Hanselman. This is
another episode of Hansel minutes

15
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.070
today. I'm talking with dr.
Jennifer coolant from the growth

16
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.480
coaching Institute. She's an industrial
organizational psychologist and she helps

17
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.300
individuals and organizations in the
tech community. Hi, how are

18
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.870
you? Good. Thanks so much
for having me today, Scott,

19
00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.510
I am glad to be
chatting with you. I have

20
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.750
been looking all over this
website called O S M

21
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.930
I help Oz me help
open sourcing mental illness, help.org.

22
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.840
And your name has come
up in this website has

23
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.870
come up as I've been
trying to explore how people

24
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.530
talk about mental health in
the tech community. That's a

25
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.140
good place to start. There's
a, you know, it's, it's

26
00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.110
a new area. That's gaining
a lot of attention and

27
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.710
open sourcing. Mental illness has
sort of paved the way

28
00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.700
for, for research around this
area and supports for professionals

29
00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.760
in the tech industry. So
I'm not surprised you found

30
00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.870
your way to that website
Feels like as I'm, I'm

31
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.680
pretty active on social media
that I hear a lot

32
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.440
of discussion around particularly anxiety,
but also a bipolar disorder.

33
00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.630
I hear about depression. I'm
wondering, is it simply confirmation

34
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.920
bias that I'm hearing about
this more because there's Facebook

35
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.290
and there's Twitter, or is
there something about software and

36
00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.200
tech and open source that
brings a certain kind of

37
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.520
mind to this place and
then the tech exacerbates an

38
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.030
already underlying situation? Yeah, it's
a really good question that

39
00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.460
that comes up a lot
and it's hard to give

40
00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.180
a definitive answer, but you're
thinking along the right lines,

41
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.850
the awareness around mental health
issues in the tech industry

42
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.100
is gaining a lot of
attention. So you are starting

43
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.280
to see more people speak
out about their own experiences,

44
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.520
which is why, you know,
it looks like it's kind

45
00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.910
of more prevalent or gaining
sort of traction in the

46
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.750
industry. But the question of
why are people that are

47
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.870
working in tech, struggling with
different mental health issues? Is

48
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.560
it because certain minds are
attracted to that field or

49
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.020
is it the field is,
you know, working in that

50
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.070
field as resulting in some
mental health challenges? Again, it's

51
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.770
a hard question to answer.
I can give you as

52
00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:26.110
a professional, my personal opinion.
I don't think that working

53
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:31.540
in tech leads to mental
health problems that directly, I

54
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.140
do think that the field
attracts a certain kind of

55
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.970
brain that is a very,
you know, high expectations, really

56
00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:46.390
successful, really motivated, highly intelligent,
really good problem solvers. People

57
00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:52.090
who go into coding and
computer science. And it seems

58
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.790
to me from looking at
the research and from working

59
00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.820
with so many professionals in
tech, that that might be

60
00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.320
a tendency that that population
tends to be more prone

61
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.320
to some mental health challenges.
And when I say pro

62
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.130
and I mean more predisposed,
or baby has a genetic

63
00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.580
underlying factor to it that
is consistent with some other

64
00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.760
areas that land people in
sort of this field that

65
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.380
they're in right now. Interesting.
So if I may paraphrase

66
00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.410
the things that make us
good at our jobs may

67
00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.320
also make some aspects of
the job in our personality,

68
00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.740
somewhat challenging. Absolutely. It's, it's
kind of, if you want

69
00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.960
to compare it to in
the developer community, it tends

70
00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.520
to be very an introverted
community. The minds that are

71
00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.630
attracted to the computer science
work, the developer work tend

72
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.270
to be more on the
introverted side. So it's not

73
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.570
that working in tech is
creating people who are introverted.

74
00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:53.190
Although there are some challenges
of isolation and working siloed

75
00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.460
or remotely that can play
into that. But I think

76
00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.010
it's more sort of the
way that that brain is

77
00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:03.150
developed. Those tendencies tend to
be consistent across the population,

78
00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.550
at least to a degree
where, you know, it stands

79
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.420
out is, is a common
theme. Okay. And then might

80
00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.240
it be also our attempts
to be more welcoming and

81
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.290
more open and conscious and
kind online that also allow

82
00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.710
people to express what might
have been hidden before. So

83
00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.020
then we get a little
bit of confirmation bias as

84
00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.020
it feels like everyone's anxious
and everyone's uptight and everyone's

85
00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.960
stressed out as we kind
of vent online. It seems

86
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.360
like, you know, 20 years
ago, I didn't even think

87
00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.390
about this, but now everyone
is thinking, Right. And not

88
00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.550
only do we, you know,
do people have the platform

89
00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:39.930
to discuss this and vent
or seek support, but the

90
00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.720
issue around stigma is much
different today than it was

91
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.450
20 years ago. So people
were much more reluctant to

92
00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:48.510
speak out and say, I
have depressive symptoms, or I'm

93
00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:51.840
feeling anxious because of the
social stigma around it. And

94
00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.610
as that has been improving,
you're seeing people, you know,

95
00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.960
reaching out more and talking
more candidly about it, which

96
00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.530
is, which is really great
because that's how people seek

97
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:08.120
support and, you know, reach
out when otherwise the stigma

98
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.430
might hinder them from doing
so. Is there anything bad

99
00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.760
or anything negative about people
for lack of a better

100
00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:20.230
word? Self-diagnosing, I've heard people
say I have an anxiety

101
00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:23.920
disorder and I was diagnosed
by a licensed therapist or

102
00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:27.610
a clinical psychologist. And then
other people just self-diagnosis is

103
00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:31.840
there danger in self-diagnosis in
this country? I think there

104
00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.200
can always be danger. And
self-diagnosis because of course the

105
00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.590
error, the error is, is
higher when you don't have

106
00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:42.990
a professional diagnosing someone. And
of course you have your,

107
00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:46.000
your own bias when you're
trying to diagnose yourself. I

108
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.760
do. I do think that
if someone recognizes that they

109
00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:53.200
struggle with anxiety and they
identify with having an anxiety

110
00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:57.550
disorder or anxiety challenges that
that's okay, whatever gets them

111
00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:59.650
to the point of reaching
out and trying to get

112
00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:04.660
help and validation for that
is beneficial. But of course,

113
00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:08.800
like I said, there's that,
there's that concern of misdiagnosis

114
00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.200
where it really is helpful
to have a professional, make

115
00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.200
sure you're on the right
track to getting supports and

116
00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:18.460
treatment for the correct, you
know, condition or challenges that

117
00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:22.750
are, are taking place. Yeah.
Since the only person who's

118
00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:25.060
had I'm inside is my
own. I can only use

119
00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:27.970
my own experiences as my
bit of context. I can

120
00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:30.820
see how other people behave
and how other people say

121
00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:33.250
that they feel. But I
can only tell how I

122
00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:35.590
feel. So I'll ask a
couple of questions and if

123
00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:38.740
you'll indulge me and forgive
my ignorance, if I get

124
00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:44.290
something wrong, what does anxiety
feel like? That is unhealthy

125
00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:48.670
anxiety versus healthy anxiety? Yeah,
it's a really good question.

126
00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:51.370
And I can answer this
sort of across the spectrum

127
00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:55.300
of different emotional challenges, not
just anxiety. So the big

128
00:07:55.300 --> 00:08:00.910
difference between struggling with anxiety
and having a diagnosis, a

129
00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:05.020
clinical diagnosis of an anxiety
disorder is not just that

130
00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:10.090
you have the symptoms, you
must meet criteria specific symptoms

131
00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:13.540
for that diagnosis. But the
second piece that people tend

132
00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:18.850
to forget is that that
symptomatology has to negatively impact

133
00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:23.050
your ability to function. So
you might feel anxious. It

134
00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:25.930
might not feel good. You
might have some social anxiety,

135
00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:28.630
it might impact your work
or your relationships. A lot

136
00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:32.170
of people have that. That
is a pretty common experience

137
00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:34.690
as a human, especially these
days, and especially working in

138
00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:38.980
tech, but it's not really
considered a diagnosis or a

139
00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:43.270
condition necessarily that requires treatment,
unless it is having a

140
00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:46.990
negative impact on your ability
to function. So, you know,

141
00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:49.630
you can't get through the
Workday. You're not able to

142
00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:52.630
collaborate with other people, whatever
that looks like. So that's

143
00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:56.130
the really crucial second piece
of a, and the difference

144
00:08:56.130 --> 00:09:00.150
between feeling anxious and having
an anxiety disorder or feeling

145
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:04.830
depressed, or having, you know,
clinical depression, which might warrant

146
00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:08.880
more treatment than say the
average person who experiences anxiety,

147
00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:12.520
anxiety in their lives. So
I've, I went in and

148
00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:15.260
this is probably dumb. So
again, forgive me, but I

149
00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.810
went and did a quiz
online and it asked me

150
00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:20.600
questions about anxiety in the
context of, do you get

151
00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:24.470
hot flashes? Do you get
heart palpitations? Do you feel

152
00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:28.400
unable to move parental kind
of emotional paralysis? Is that

153
00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:33.340
what anxiety feels like? That's
a really, really tricky question.

154
00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:37.220
You're throwing out there. Anxiety
is actually a spectrum of

155
00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:40.160
disorders. So there are a
number of different types of

156
00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:45.410
anxiety disorders, like social anxiety
disorder or panic disorder, or

157
00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:49.130
post traumatic stress disorder. And
these do look different. So

158
00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:51.380
it's hard to answer, you
know, this is what quote

159
00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:55.550
unquote anxiety looks like. However,
people do tend to describe

160
00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:59.930
it as having a physiological
impact. So that sounds like

161
00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:01.820
some of the things that
you were asked about is

162
00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:05.240
what is the experience in
your body physiological? And then

163
00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:07.610
of course the cognitive piece
of it, too, which people

164
00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:10.640
describe as sort of a
racing mind and ability to

165
00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:14.180
sleep, because you're constantly, you
know, going, going, going mentally.

166
00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:19.640
Some anxiety disorders have other
behavioral implications too. So it

167
00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:22.820
does vary a lot. I
think a lot of people

168
00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:27.950
can relate to struggling with
anxiety again, because of the

169
00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:32.660
society culture industry that we
work in and a more

170
00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:36.770
mild level of anxiety is,
is like I said, something

171
00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:38.690
a lot of people can
connect to. And I wonder

172
00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:41.030
if they took, was looking
more at this sort of

173
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:44.090
traditional idea of, do you
feel anxious, or if it

174
00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:47.030
was trying to get to
the root of an ex

175
00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:52.670
a true diagnosable anxiety disorder.
And it sounds like from

176
00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:55.280
what you said before, the
essence of these things is

177
00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:59.120
whether or not it changes
how you can function. Like

178
00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:02.480
if you find that something
that used to work no

179
00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:04.370
longer works, or that you're
unable to get out of

180
00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:07.250
bed or go to work
and not feel, you know,

181
00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:10.880
like we all feel uncomfortable
or awkward or anxious, but

182
00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:14.060
where is that? That threshold,
that moment where it's like,

183
00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:16.880
you know, this is a
bigger deal than I thought

184
00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:19.250
it was, and I need
to go in and you

185
00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:21.200
know, like, how do we
tell when it's time to

186
00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.060
seek help, I guess, is
what I'm trying to say.

187
00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:27.260
Everyone gets the blues, but
not everyone gets depressed. Everyone

188
00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.990
gets butterflies when they give
a talk or any kind

189
00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:34.460
of public speaking, but not
everyone is, has para paralyzable

190
00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:37.850
or para paralysis based anxiety
and is unable to actually

191
00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:40.850
give the talk. Sure. So
you kind of hit it

192
00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:44.000
on the nose. If something
has changed all of a

193
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.910
sudden it becomes more difficult
to be productive at work

194
00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:51.050
or to maintain your relationships,
especially if there's not something

195
00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:55.750
very obviously explaining that, that
change, then that can be

196
00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:59.470
an indication that, you know,
it's having an impact to

197
00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:04.210
a degree where it's detrimental
and probably needs some attention.

198
00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:08.110
But the other thing to
consider where I see people

199
00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:11.380
coming to the realization that
it is maybe a bigger

200
00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:15.610
thing that needs a more
intensive treatment or approaches is

201
00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:18.220
if you can't access the
supports you need. So if

202
00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:21.370
you're feeling depressed, whether it's
just the change in seasons,

203
00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:24.310
or, you know, there was
a breakup or you lost

204
00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:27.460
your job, if you're feeling
depressed and you reach out

205
00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:29.980
for support. So, you know,
you try to increase your

206
00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:34.210
social supports or take care
of yourself, exercise, diet, or

207
00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:37.810
even maybe reach out to
a therapist. If you, if

208
00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:41.590
you do those things, it,
you tend to see an

209
00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:43.840
improvement. I mean, these are
the areas that we've shown

210
00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:47.050
through research can, can improve
in areas such as depression

211
00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:50.710
or anxiety, but if you
can't access those supports, if

212
00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:53.710
you can't get yourself to
a therapist or you can't

213
00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:58.930
get yourself to, to work
out, then that's another indication

214
00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:02.020
that you probably need a
higher level of support. You

215
00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:05.350
probably need to involve someone
else. I get asked this

216
00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:09.130
a lot around Medicaid medication
and, and taking drugs for

217
00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:12.310
mental health challenges, which as
a psychologist, I do not

218
00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:14.830
push the drugs at all.
I actually start with all

219
00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:18.100
of the other, other ways
of supporting people before going

220
00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:22.630
to psychiatric care. But if
you, if you can't access

221
00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:25.930
those other supports, like, you
know, getting to a therapist

222
00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:29.420
or, or working on these
other areas, then that's, that's

223
00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:32.320
a time where it might
be beneficial to speak to

224
00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:36.100
a doctor about, you know,
maybe even short term supports

225
00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:40.480
to be able to access
the, the sort of treatment

226
00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:43.090
that you need to work
through, what you're dealing with.

227
00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:46.680
I see a lot. And
I've talked about this a

228
00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:49.410
little bit myself about feeling
like a phony or feeling

229
00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:52.770
like I've a bit of
an imposter. And some days

230
00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:54.900
I feel like, Oh my
goodness. You know, I've been

231
00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:57.240
in this business for 30
years and I'm surprised I'm

232
00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:59.400
still here. And that people
will talk to me. And

233
00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:01.230
then other days I feel
like, well, you know, I

234
00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:03.590
do, okay. You know, like
I'll do a thing and

235
00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:06.120
I'll be like, Hey, look,
I did that thing. I'm

236
00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:10.620
over here at the OSM.
I help.org forums. And I

237
00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:13.440
see a very common thread
here. There's a particular thread

238
00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:16.590
that says I'm a senior
software engineer, but I don't

239
00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:20.010
feel like it. Why is
it that we find ourselves

240
00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:22.410
in tech, you know, like
that we feel this sense

241
00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:24.990
of in over our heads.
I mean, my brother's a

242
00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:27.510
firefighter and he doesn't feel
in over his heads and

243
00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:29.790
I've never heard a firefighter
feeling like they can't do

244
00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:33.630
that. But I consistently feel
in technical environments that people

245
00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:35.970
feel like, wow, I have
this title. And I don't

246
00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:38.640
feel like I'm the same
as my title. Yeah. I

247
00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:41.400
mean, one, there, there are
a number of ways to

248
00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:44.640
speak to this. I think
one is, is we have

249
00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:48.030
senior engineers who are 24
years old. So part of

250
00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:51.620
it is just connect, you
know, coming right of college,

251
00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:54.170
working for two years, all,
all of a sudden being

252
00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:57.890
considered a senior because, you
know, if your technical skills,

253
00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:00.470
but still lacking some other
skills that allow you to

254
00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:03.680
feel confident in that area.
We also work in an

255
00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:09.230
industry that highlights sort of
the 10 X engineer and

256
00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.200
the, you know, the unicorns
and the founders that are

257
00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:16.190
super successful and the professionals
who move up the ranks.

258
00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:19.310
And we don't tend to
hear from most of the

259
00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:22.250
community, which are the, you
know, people sitting in the

260
00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:27.170
back doing great work. And
so everyone's sort of comparing

261
00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:31.850
themselves to this idea of
success that they've either grown

262
00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:34.460
up with, which is, you
know, very high expectations of

263
00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:38.540
themselves. And the industry allows
for as well where we

264
00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:41.630
just really, really push people
to Excel and be their

265
00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:46.280
best and be the most
innovative and productive and successful,

266
00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:49.340
which are all great things.
And, and really does push

267
00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:52.430
people to Excel in a
lot of ways. Unfortunately it

268
00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:54.500
leads to some of the
problems that we're here talking

269
00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:57.560
about today too, because that's
a lot of pressure that

270
00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:01.040
people are not prepared for
and not sure what to

271
00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:04.820
do once all of a
sudden they're a senior engineer

272
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:07.460
at a company and they
don't feel like they can

273
00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:10.250
ask for help because they're
supposed to be the expert,

274
00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:13.970
or they feel like they're
lacking in some area, but

275
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.910
they can't really show that
to someone or, or the

276
00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:19.820
company or their colleagues will
realize that they're a fraud

277
00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:21.590
and that they're not supposed
to be at that, you

278
00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:25.490
know, position. So it's this
kind of constant battle of

279
00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:30.380
these very high expectations. And
even when you've, you're meeting

280
00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:34.010
them, being pushed even further,
it's sort of an impossible,

281
00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:38.480
an impossible reach. I think,
you know, what we ask

282
00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:41.870
of professionals in tech and
part of the reason tech

283
00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:45.170
is innovative and moves so
quickly forward, but sort of

284
00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:49.970
at the expense of constantly
being disappointed in yourself or

285
00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:53.750
your work or your failures,
which I believe is a

286
00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:56.600
coach in the industry, or
is part of the process.

287
00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:59.870
It's part of the innovative
process to be failing constantly.

288
00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:03.370
Yeah. Being able to fail,
but also feel like one

289
00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:06.790
can fail safely. I always
say fail fast, fail often,

290
00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:11.650
but being allowed to fail
has a component of privilege

291
00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:13.960
to it. And the ability
to do that without someone

292
00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:17.800
flipping the bozo bit on
you and saying, Oh, look

293
00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:20.740
at Jennifer failed. Now she
doesn't know what she's doing.

294
00:17:20.830 --> 00:17:22.990
And you only get to
fail once. And maybe I

295
00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:24.880
get to fail three times
before they flipped a bit

296
00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:27.580
on me, that paranoia that
I have to be perfect

297
00:17:27.610 --> 00:17:29.920
or otherwise people will they'll
find out that I really

298
00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:32.140
am not supposed to be
here is a big challenge.

299
00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:34.480
Yeah. That kind of speaks
to your question earlier. You

300
00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:37.450
know, I think, I think
that the, you know, genetic,

301
00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:39.940
genetic makeup, however you want
to describe sort of the

302
00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:44.590
brains that are attracted to
this kind of work, they,

303
00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:46.660
you know, for example, they
might tend to be a

304
00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:49.290
little more on the paranoid
side, but then they work

305
00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:51.900
in an industry where it
just plays into that and

306
00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:56.580
sort of, you know, really
just pushes that forward even

307
00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:59.760
more. So, you know, being
born with having kind of

308
00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:02.760
a high expectations of yourself,
how you're raised maybe leading

309
00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:06.180
to high expectations. And then
you get into a career

310
00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:10.440
where you have extremely high
expectations sometimes so high that

311
00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:13.860
it's not possible to meet
them. I see this a

312
00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:17.790
lot, but then when you
fail to meet them, really

313
00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:23.010
personalizing it as your own
failure and not a sort

314
00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:25.740
of function of the difficult
scenario that you're in or

315
00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:28.890
the difficult work that where
there is failure is to

316
00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:32.660
be expected. No one wants
to manage databases if they

317
00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:36.680
can avoid it. That's why
Mongo DB made Mongo DB

318
00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:41.180
Atlas, a global cloud database
service that runs on AWS,

319
00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:45.410
GCP and Azure. You can
deploy a fully managed Mongo

320
00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:48.710
DB database in minutes with
just a few clicks or

321
00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:53.360
a few API calls, Mongo
DB, Atlas, automates deployment, automated

322
00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:56.660
updates, handles scaling, and more
so that you can focus

323
00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:59.900
on your application instead of
taking care of your database,

324
00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:06.320
you can get started free@mongodb.com
slash Atlas. Now, if you're

325
00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:09.770
already managing a Mongo DB
deployment, Atlas has a live

326
00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:13.370
migration service. So you can
migrate it easily with minimal

327
00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:16.430
downtime and then get back
to what matters, stop managing

328
00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:21.140
your database and start using
Mongo DB, Atlas, that idea

329
00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:23.690
that you just said about,
of, of personalizing it, of

330
00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:27.530
internalizing something. And then also
of course, having the community

331
00:19:27.530 --> 00:19:29.810
go around and make it
about you as well. It

332
00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:32.300
can be really, really challenging
cause you're reflecting your feelings

333
00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:35.870
back on yourself, into this
feedback loop of how you

334
00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:38.360
suck. And then you look
around and we have these

335
00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:42.770
titles, right? Like if Beyonce
had the title senior software

336
00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:46.370
engineer, I would probably feel
pretty lousy about my title

337
00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:49.790
because you know, I'm not
Beyonce, which gets to that

338
00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:51.980
point that you made before
about the 10 X engineer.

339
00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:55.460
That's every time you see
the unicorn of the 10

340
00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:58.640
X engineer, which, you know,
may or may not exist,

341
00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:01.550
all of that is just
a system, a failure system.

342
00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:04.100
That's been set up by
ourselves and by our industry

343
00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:07.700
that does nothing, but make
one feel bad about themselves.

344
00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:11.390
Right? Right. And the, the
concern that I have is

345
00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:18.170
we're working in this industry
that has these challenges, but

346
00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:21.530
we're not talking about them.
So everyone's sort of suffering

347
00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:25.070
in silence, everyone, you know,
not everyone, but a lot

348
00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:28.580
of people are feeling like
imposters are feeling like the

349
00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:31.280
failure of their project or
their company or of their

350
00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:35.900
team is their fault. And
no one's talking about it

351
00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:38.840
to realize that other people
are feeling the same way.

352
00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:44.720
And to realize that it
really is a pervasive scenario

353
00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:48.310
across so many professionals in
this. And I think that

354
00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:52.090
if people realized that, that
it wouldn't be as turn,

355
00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:55.600
Ally's internalized quite as much,
and people would be talking

356
00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:58.030
a little bit more about
it to, you know, get

357
00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:00.460
support from each other and
just have that more open

358
00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:04.200
discussion. So when someone identifies
that they might have a

359
00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:06.630
problem, they might feel a
certain kind of way, but

360
00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:10.740
they may not necessarily have
fantastic health insurance or a

361
00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:15.930
community or a, what's the
word, a safety net, where

362
00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:19.020
are places that they can
go and find resources to

363
00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:23.490
explore and get support. The
open sourcing mental illness website

364
00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:26.520
is a great place to
go for a sort of

365
00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:29.550
a wealth of different supports.
There are three handbooks. One

366
00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:34.170
is specifically for employees who
are struggling with mental health

367
00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:38.070
problems while being a professional
in the workplace. I will

368
00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:40.950
say that a lot of
it is very legal. So

369
00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:43.950
if you can ignore that
and jump right to sort

370
00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:47.970
of the supports the different
hotlines, the different resources, there

371
00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:51.900
are a lot because the,
the discussion around mental health

372
00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:56.070
is growing so much attention
in society in general, there

373
00:21:56.070 --> 00:22:00.030
are also great resources online.
If this is more of

374
00:22:00.030 --> 00:22:04.050
a mild anxiety, you know,
temporarily feeling depressed, there are

375
00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:08.550
great resources. My recommendation is
a professional is that we

376
00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:13.080
stop isolating ourselves even further
by trying to solve the

377
00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:16.920
problem by ourselves on our
computer, but that we actually

378
00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:19.140
reach out and start talking
to people. There is a

379
00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:23.070
lot of research around how
talking is a cathartic process.

380
00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:26.850
It, you know, the, the
field of therapy psychotherapy in

381
00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:29.820
general is, is, is largely
based on this. It does

382
00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:33.000
have an impact on the
brain that doesn't make the

383
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.200
depression or anxiety go away,
but it moves the neural

384
00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:39.810
activity a little bit in
the brain that allows it

385
00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:43.770
to be, have less of
a sting. So it can

386
00:22:43.770 --> 00:22:47.820
be a little bit easier
to move forward and problem

387
00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:51.210
solve and come up with
solutions and, you know, make

388
00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:54.270
the effort that you need
to, to, to improve things,

389
00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:58.470
just following a conversation, you
know, telling someone how you

390
00:22:58.470 --> 00:23:02.490
feel. It feels like speaking
about these things is really

391
00:23:02.490 --> 00:23:05.610
step one, like a sense
of isolation will only make

392
00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:08.940
it worse. Are you a
fan of one-on-one therapy or

393
00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:11.760
do you feel that like
even user groups and, you

394
00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:14.670
know, personal self, you know,
getting together with friends and

395
00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:16.890
talking about these things in
a, in a circle, it

396
00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:20.280
can be therapeutic. I think,
yes. I think it's all

397
00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:23.550
therapeutic. It obviously depends a
lot on what your needs

398
00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:27.360
are and how intense the
challenges are you're dealing with,

399
00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:31.800
which determines, you know, what
level of support you might

400
00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:35.010
need. But I don't, I
don't necessarily feel like you

401
00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:37.320
have to talk to someone
one-on-one, I think there's a

402
00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:40.920
huge value in group discussions
and bringing even more people

403
00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:44.490
into that discussion and how
you're feeling and expressing that

404
00:23:44.490 --> 00:23:48.800
to other. So if a
group setting is not terrifying

405
00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:52.400
in itself, which is for
a lot of people, that's

406
00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:54.980
a great, you know, that's
a great place to get

407
00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:58.640
some of that catharsis. If,
if that is very intimidating

408
00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:01.580
for you, you can talk
to someone one-on-one, if you

409
00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:04.040
don't want that person to
be a partner, a family

410
00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:06.920
member, a friend, there are
plenty of professionals out there,

411
00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:12.110
therapists, coaches that that can
provide sort of that safe

412
00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:16.070
space to talk through what's
going on as well. So

413
00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:18.200
there really are, there really
are a lot of options

414
00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.210
and you can start wherever
you want. Like maybe you

415
00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:23.180
start in a group setting
and that doesn't work for

416
00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:26.420
you. Then you can, you
know, tap another friend and

417
00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:28.190
try to talk to them.
One-on-one if that doesn't work

418
00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:29.990
for you, you can maybe
reach out to a coach

419
00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:32.240
or a therapist there. You
know, it's kind of an

420
00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:36.380
experiment. There's no one right
answer to this. So it's

421
00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:39.350
part of it is trying
different things. And like I

422
00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:43.550
said earlier, if you can't
get yourself to try different

423
00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:47.150
things, that's a big indicator
that you might need more

424
00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:50.050
support than what you're reaching
out for. That is a

425
00:24:50.050 --> 00:24:52.600
really good point. Any action
at all, that is positive

426
00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:55.210
forward motion, whether it be
calling a friend or just

427
00:24:55.210 --> 00:24:59.170
reaching out and letting yourself
be heard is better than

428
00:24:59.170 --> 00:25:00.910
doing nothing and curling up
in a ball. But if

429
00:25:00.910 --> 00:25:02.770
you can only curl up
in a ball, that's when

430
00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:05.950
you really need to take
action. Exactly, exactly. I would

431
00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:07.600
say, you know, if you,
if you have trouble getting

432
00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:11.770
out of bed, if you
are having trouble being effective

433
00:25:11.770 --> 00:25:17.020
at work or maintaining your
relationships and can't access, you

434
00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:19.360
know, can't experiment with some
different things to see if

435
00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:21.250
you can get out of
that rut, that it would

436
00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:24.250
be beneficial to reach out
to a professional and just

437
00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:27.520
get some insight for how
to approach those challenges. Now,

438
00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:30.460
you recently spoke at a
cube con in cloud native

439
00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:35.050
con in North America here
in 2019. And you pointed

440
00:25:35.050 --> 00:25:38.230
out in your talk that
the number of people that

441
00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:40.990
are working in the tech
community that have these challenges,

442
00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:44.590
these challenges with mental illnesses,
quite disproportionate to the prevalence

443
00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:48.340
of the general population. And
you specifically point out that

444
00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:51.040
people working in the tech
community are particularly at risk

445
00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:56.380
for burnout is burnout or
mental illness. It's not. So

446
00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:59.380
just to be clear, mental,
mental illness, this is a

447
00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:03.010
big misunderstanding. Mental illness is
not actually a term or

448
00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:06.910
something that's research or something
that's diagnosed. It is a

449
00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:12.580
metaphor that our society uses
to describe a diagnosable mental

450
00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:16.900
health disorder, which is what
I mentioned earlier, where you

451
00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:19.990
meet certain symptom criteria, and
then it also has a

452
00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:22.180
negative impact on your life.
And you have to be,

453
00:26:22.210 --> 00:26:24.700
you know, those symptoms have
to be a couple standard

454
00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:27.520
deviations away from the mean,
which is where most people

455
00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:32.650
fall. Most people's behaviors fall
so burnout. And the reason

456
00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:36.310
it comes up in my
talks when, when discussing mental

457
00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:40.480
health is because burnout looks
a lot like a mental

458
00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:43.200
health challenge. So if you
look at what's going in

459
00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:47.910
the brain, some of the
neurotransmitters that are under overactive

460
00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:50.940
tend to be the same,
which is why when someone

461
00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:55.140
is burned out, they tend
to demonstrate symptoms of depression

462
00:26:55.140 --> 00:27:00.300
and anxiety and just emotional
dysregulation and, you know, sleep

463
00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:03.840
problems. Just these things that
tend to be categorized as

464
00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:07.860
under the, you know, the
mental, mental health disorders or

465
00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:11.250
mental illness. So it does
look, it can look very,

466
00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:13.470
very similar, which is why,
you know, and it all

467
00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:16.500
falls under the scope of,
of mental health. So that's

468
00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:19.410
why it comes up a
lot in conversations that I

469
00:27:19.410 --> 00:27:22.630
have with people around mental
health and technology. So I

470
00:27:22.650 --> 00:27:26.180
understand that that certainly the
word normal is very relative

471
00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:28.130
and it can somehow it
can sometimes be a word

472
00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:30.590
that may not necessarily be
appropriate or feel appropriate, but,

473
00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:34.730
you know, the scientific version
of normal is kind of

474
00:27:34.730 --> 00:27:37.670
within a standard deviation or
so of the mean, I

475
00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:41.660
suppose, but if, if, is
it normal to burn out

476
00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:43.190
or is that just part
of the ebb and flow

477
00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:47.180
of working in tech? I
think it is very normalized

478
00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:50.990
in tech almost to a
default that we're not paying

479
00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:54.830
attention to the impact that
it's having on our ability

480
00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:57.650
to function and be successful
at work just by the

481
00:27:57.650 --> 00:28:00.320
nature of the industry and
what we chatted about earlier,

482
00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:05.630
the innovation forward movement, the
new technology, the high expectations,

483
00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:10.790
the fast pace, the long
hours, the challenges of, you

484
00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:17.600
know, startups and, and just,
it all leads to really

485
00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:23.240
exhausting our abilities as professionals.
And because we kind of

486
00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:28.850
ignore the, the indicators leading
up to burnout, because that's

487
00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:30.650
what we do in tech
is we just keep going

488
00:28:30.650 --> 00:28:34.550
and going and going. It's
not surprising to me that

489
00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:37.640
so many people are burned
out, especially this time of

490
00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:40.160
year. I would say most
people I'm working with right

491
00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:43.700
now are, you know, in
that range of burnout for

492
00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:48.590
sure. And the concerning piece
of this I think is

493
00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:51.320
aside from it, doesn't feel
great and you feel depressed

494
00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:54.500
and anxious or whatever, whatever
burnout looks like for you,

495
00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:58.340
aside from that burnout has
a huge impact on your

496
00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:01.580
ability to work and be
effective and concentrate and be

497
00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:06.110
productive. So it's almost to
our detriment to ignore burnout

498
00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:09.020
or to put in place
a culture and practice that

499
00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:14.150
actually encourage it because it's,
you know, damaging the work

500
00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:18.290
overall and the productivity and
ultimately the success of the

501
00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:20.330
work and the company that
we're working with. If we're

502
00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:24.440
working with a company In,
in your talks while there's

503
00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:27.260
certainly no silver bullet or
a single thing that one

504
00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:30.920
can do a repetitive theme
that I've heard you say

505
00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:36.590
is sleep, unplug and talk.
Why are those the three

506
00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:39.140
kind of like pillars of
one getting started to think

507
00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:43.720
about their own mental health?
I like these Three areas.

508
00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:47.470
I like encouraging people around
these three areas because it

509
00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:51.100
has an impact wherever you
fall on the mental health

510
00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:54.190
spectrum. So if you have
been diagnosed with a mental

511
00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:57.670
health disorder, though, these three
things can help. If you,

512
00:29:57.820 --> 00:30:02.440
you know, are temporarily experiencing
mild or symptoms of mental

513
00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:05.140
health issues, it can help
if you're experiencing burnout, it

514
00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:08.710
can help. The, the truth
is that these three areas

515
00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:11.620
have an impact on the
brain in an, in a

516
00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:15.010
way that will help reduce
some of these very common

517
00:30:15.010 --> 00:30:19.840
symptoms that we categorize. You
know, it doesn't matter how

518
00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:22.330
we characterized it as a,
you know, as a disorder,

519
00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:26.320
an illness, burnout, norm quote,
unquote, normal functioning for tech.

520
00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:28.360
However you want to describe
it. It's going to have,

521
00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:33.040
you know, it should have
a positive impact. We know

522
00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:37.270
just from the research around
it, sleep is hugely important.

523
00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:40.480
It's hugely important for someone
with a diagnosed mental health

524
00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:46.930
condition, hugely important for someone
experiencing burnout, hugely important for

525
00:30:46.930 --> 00:30:49.780
the person who's feeling depressed
or anxious. And they don't

526
00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:52.690
know if it's a result
of burnout, or if it's

527
00:30:52.690 --> 00:30:56.710
a mental health disorder, that's
a great place to start

528
00:30:56.710 --> 00:31:00.700
is make sure you're getting
enough sleep because sleep deprivation

529
00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:05.560
mimics a mental health condition,
a mental health disorder or

530
00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:08.080
illness as people say. So
I have a lot of

531
00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:09.820
people ask me, you know,
how do I know if

532
00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:12.310
I have a mental illness
or a, you know, or

533
00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:15.460
I'm burned out, or, and
I always say, check on

534
00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:18.280
your sleep first, make sure
that your brain is getting

535
00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:21.760
the rest that it needs.
So you can rule that

536
00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:25.390
out. So that's where sleep
come from, comes from the

537
00:31:25.390 --> 00:31:29.890
unplugging. Again, same thing. It
can sort of help differentiate

538
00:31:29.890 --> 00:31:33.340
between burnout or a true
mental health condition, or just

539
00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:36.130
more mild symptoms that need
sort of a break from

540
00:31:36.130 --> 00:31:38.800
the intensity of the work
that we're doing. And then

541
00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:41.110
the, the talking, we already
kind of touched on the

542
00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:45.400
cathartic process of talking to
other people and talking about

543
00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:49.520
how we feel Fantastic. Well,
folks can check out all

544
00:31:49.530 --> 00:31:51.960
these different resources and videos
and research that we talked

545
00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:55.620
about it. Oh, S M

550
00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:16.020
you so much for chatting
with me today. Thanks so

551
00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:18.570
much for having me Scott,
and thanks for your attention

552
00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:21.780
to this area. It really
is something that, that needs

553
00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:26.070
more promotion and attention because
it impacts so many people

554
00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:29.280
in this industry. So many
people can identify with some

555
00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:31.650
of these challenges. And so
it needs to be a

556
00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:35.490
more regular conversation. I appreciate
the attention. I appreciate you

557
00:32:35.490 --> 00:32:38.490
and your work. And this
has been another episode of

558
00:32:38.490 --> 00:32:55.270

again. Next time. <inaudible>.
