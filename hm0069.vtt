In this episode, Scott and
Carl discussed current hardware and

9
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:04.580
building a new developer machine.
Hi, this is Carl Franklin. You're

10
00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.670
listening to Hansel minutes from
Hanselman it's dot com. I'm

11
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.550
here with Scott Hanselman again.
Hi, mr. Scott, how are

12
00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.730
you, sir? I'm fine. What's
up this fine day? Well,

13
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.640
I finally got permission from
the wife to build my

14
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.660
computer. The dream machine is
where this is the ultimate

15
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.290
developer rig the new computer
for the home. Awesome. I

16
00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.360
was going to buy a
Mac book. I've been talking

17
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.450
about this on and off,
but, you know, and I,

18
00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.500
I even went and put
it into my shopping cart

19
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.390
on apple.com and I let
it sit there for a

20
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.030
bit. I went to the
Apple store at the mall

21
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.190
and put it all together
and thought about it, but

22
00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.400
I just couldn't justify $4,000
at this point when I

23
00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.040
figured I don't really use
the Mac mini that I

24
00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.200
have right now. So I'm
just going to hang back

25
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.450
a little bit on the
Mac, but I do use

26
00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.270
my home PC a lot.
It's a P for, and

27
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.580
it's just not cutting it
for me right now. And

28
00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.670
I've had a lot of
bad experiences with Vista and

29
00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.100
I just felt that I
needed to get this machine

30
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.350
fresh. This was one of
those computers that I think

31
00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.180
we all have had at
one point or another, where

32
00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.510
we build it ourselves. We
went down to Fry's and

33
00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.120
then we continue to kind
of make it a Frank

34
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.700
and computer adding a part
here and there. And, you

35
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.590
know, a couple hundred bucks
at a time trying to

36
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.970
keep it, keep it alive,
but it's just not happening

37
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.370
for me. So I wanted
to put together my own

38
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.200
machine, but I realized that
since, gosh, I haven't been

39
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.770
really good at building hardware
since the Pentium three Pentium

40
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.980
four days and all this
new core, two duo stuff

41
00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.410
was a little out of
my expertise. So I called

42
00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.490
Jeff Atwood from coding horror.
That's what happens when you

43
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.280
have an it department at
your disposal? It's funny how

44
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.890
that works, but I really
wanted to make a great

45
00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.440
machine. And then I realized
that as I looked around

46
00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.830
on the net, there's so
many people building ultimate gamer

47
00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.920
rigs. I just not interested
in an ultimate game or

48
00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.310
rig. I wanted an ultimate
developer rig. Just like if

49
00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.750
you built a machine, you'd
want it to be a

50
00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.070
really good video and audio
editing rig. Yeah. Well, it's

51
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:01.990
Funny, I thought about this
when you told me about

52
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.680
today's topic and you know,
a developer rig doesn't really

53
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:11.050
need to be the Mondo.
Giganto powerful thing in terms

54
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.730
of processor speed more Ram
is good. Of course, but

55
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.620
I don't think it has
to be up there with,

56
00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:19.770
you know, ones that are
machines that are going to

57
00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.630
do video processing per se,
or realtime rendering or anything

58
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.860
like that. Just because, you
know, the compiler is pretty

59
00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.620
darn fast, even on a,
even on a slow machine

60
00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.340
by today's standards. Well, the
other things that I wanted

61
00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.010
to be able to deal
with from a developer perspective

62
00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.670
is things like parallel builds
like an orcas. Ms. Build

63
00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.100
allows you to tell it
how many processors you want

64
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.380
it to, how many processes
you want it to spin

65
00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.530
up to do parallel builds.
So that's the kind of

66
00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.570
thing we're putting together. A,
a quad core system might,

67
00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.400
might be a real benefit.
But now that you mentioned

68
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.400
it, Scott, I think that
maybe the power, it would

69
00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.470
be good if you're going
to be running virtual PCs

70
00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.460
or VMware sessions, which many
developers do, or even virtual

71
00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:08.220
server to do testing against,
against server configurations. So, so

72
00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.710
in that, in that sense,
yes, you probably do want

73
00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.740
more power. Yeah. I wanted
to find a balance between

74
00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.490
the money power, you know,
price, performance ratio. You know,

75
00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:20.250
I first I said, well,
maybe I'll just go nuts.

76
00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.600
I'll, I'll spend four thousand five thousand dollars, make
it a business expense and

77
00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.990
buy the ultimate computer. But
it seemed to me and

78
00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.110
I talked with Jeff, Jeff
Atwood, my friend from coding

79
00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:37.080
horror.com that there is really
a sweet spot around anywhere

80
00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.130
between 1600 and $2,000 where
you can put together quite

81
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.860
a machine. And if you
go and spend double that

82
00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.580
or triple that you really
don't get twice the machine

83
00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.860
or three times that machine,
you get some amazing stuff,

84
00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:53.730
but you know, the difference
between a $200 processor and

85
00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.180
a $500 processor and a
$900 processor, it's really all

86
00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.300
just kind of artificial it's
it's prices are always dropping.

87
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.130
Anything you buy now, of
course it's gonna be obsolete

88
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.620
in a few years. Yeah.
But we wanted to find

89
00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.460
that that balance I've always
found the sweet spot. Pretty

90
00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.880
easy to identify by going
to new ag.com and looking

91
00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.820
at each category, you know,
processors and whatever, and then

92
00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.420
sort by most popular and
really smart over there. Yeah.

93
00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:23.310
It's not just the, the
best, the best rated cause

94
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.040
sometimes the best rated will
also be the most expensive,

95
00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.010
but the most popular tells
you where the sweet spot

96
00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.590
is for any given component
And, and new egg is

97
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:34.380
where I ended up buying
this stuff. The list that

98
00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.750
I purchased a list of
products I purchased was that

99
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:42.960
shrink stir.com/q five zero. And
there's a lot of really

100
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.660
interesting discussion going up on
the blog right now because

101
00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.300
a lot of folks have
found places where I could

102
00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.300
have potentially squeezed a couple
of hundred dollars here and

103
00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:56.250
there saves them money. Everyone's
got opinions about motherboard brands,

104
00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.610
of course, you know, and
got opinions about hard drive.

105
00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.330
And of course the longer
that post stays there, the

106
00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.850
more comments you're going to
get because of the prices

107
00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:07.360
will be changing. Right. But
it adheres, here's basically what

108
00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.490
we tried to put together.
And I'm thinking again about

109
00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.210
the developer, you know, so
I've got a, a steel

110
00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:17.020
ATX mid tower case from
Antech. Nice. I could have

111
00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.410
gone bigger and heavier. There's
a guy who does custom

112
00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:22.750
cases. And there's also cases
that you can get where

113
00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.900
the entire case is a
giant heat sink, big aluminum

114
00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:29.470
Zalman thing. Exactly. But this,
this particular one was a

115
00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:31.750
balance. It's a little spendy
for a case to 150

116
00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:35.470
bucks, but it's a gunmetal
black real dark case literally

117
00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.990
fit in with the way
I like things. And it's

118
00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:39.880
a mid tower. So it's
big enough that we'll be

119
00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.160
able to put some sound
damping by the way I

120
00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.620
use these cases myself and
I love them. You do.

121
00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:47.170
Yeah. So this is the
Antech P one 82 that

122
00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:51.250
we got. Yep. I don't
know a lot about motherboards

123
00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:54.250
anymore. I was an ACS
guy for a while. I'd

124
00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:57.160
used a bit. And while
I've gotten a lot of

125
00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.650
negative flack for the, the
choice we made, which was

126
00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:04.870
an MSI motherboard, Jeff and
his experience has found that

127
00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:07.630
it's actually a pretty decent
motherboard. It's got the Nvidia

128
00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:10.930
and forest chip set on
it. It's a, it's an

129
00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:15.760
LGA seven 75 Intel motherboard.
It's a pretty decent motherboard.

130
00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:18.610
It's got all the things
you would expect. As far

131
00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:22.870
as lots of USB ports,
it's got gigabit land built

132
00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:26.230
into it. It's got really
nice cooling. The chip set

133
00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:30.100
is set up with aluminum
pipes and some really nice

134
00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:37.210
Northbridge, passive cooling. Jeff really
likes to focus on how

135
00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:39.130
is this thing going to
be as quiet as possible

136
00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:41.770
and as powerful as possible.
My current system is a

137
00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:45.910
real loud system. It is
really obnoxious. It sounds like

138
00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:48.430
a jet plane. I don't,
I don't really see anything

139
00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:52.270
wrong with this. I, I
would want to make sure

140
00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:56.290
that the chip sets for
the Nvidia Northbridge in Southbridge

141
00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:59.410
exists for Vista before I
bought that. But you can

142
00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:03.610
see that the, the total
there's 195 reviews in 77%

143
00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:06.880
of them are positive. So
I would say that's, that's

144
00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:09.340
pretty good. That's telling. Yeah.
It's interesting. How in the

145
00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:11.830
kinds of purchasing decisions that
folks make, whether it be

146
00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:16.420
here or on Amazon, that
you can really count on

147
00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:20.050
the reviews. There's a balance
that gets found when you

148
00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:22.990
get a lot of reviews,
you know, more than a

149
00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:25.630
few dozen, you can get
a real good sense about

150
00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:28.840
the real world experiences that
folks have. Yeah. And the

151
00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:31.150
thing to do isn't to
read the positive reviews, read

152
00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:34.840
the negative ones, see what
the negative reviewers say about

153
00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:38.080
them. Sometimes they're just mad
because, you know, they took

154
00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.300
him three weeks to get
it out the door or

155
00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:45.460
something like that. But sometimes
people have legitimate problems. Yeah.

156
00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:47.470
And one of the things
that's also worth watching out

157
00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:49.240
for is whether or not
you get a sense that

158
00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:53.890
this particular motherboard manufacturer is,
is focused on having the

159
00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:57.000
bios updated a lot, getting
the firmware updated, you know,

160
00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.280
they may have problems initially,
but if they can deal

161
00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:03.420
with them or offer you
other benefits through a constantly

162
00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:06.780
are often updated firmware, particularly
for the overclock, or this

163
00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:08.820
is a real valuable thing
to watch out for. So

164
00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:11.190
I'm not unhappy with this
motherboard, but this certainly something

165
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:13.920
I could, I could swap
out at some point I

166
00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:17.580
do like also that this
one has an external SJTA

167
00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:21.210
or Satta connector. So I've
got options for my external

168
00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:22.770
hard drives. You know, I've
got a lot of external

169
00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:24.300
hard drives in the, in
the stuff that I do.

170
00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:26.220
I run a lot of
VMs on external hard drives,

171
00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:29.430
right? Well, this has a
FireWire port and all the

172
00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:33.300
requisite USB ports, having an
external Satta connector is a

173
00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:35.490
nice, a nice benefit. I
think, as more and more

174
00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:38.520
drives a switch over to
Satta, which, which has a

175
00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:41.910
bandwidth gets you something like
three, three gigabits, a second.

176
00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:44.510
We're actually running this machine
now, or are you just

177
00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:47.270
not ready to order as
we ordered it? And I've

178
00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:51.080
shipped it down to Jeff
in California, and I'm going

179
00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:54.740
down to San Francisco on
Friday and I'm gonna meet

180
00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:57.200
up with him at his
office and we'll build it.

181
00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:59.210
So we'll have to have
a followup show, of course.

182
00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:01.670
And you can tell us
what, So we'll get, we'll

183
00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:03.020
get Jeff on the show
with us and he can

184
00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:05.120
explain, cause this is not
just a matter of putting

185
00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:09.380
it together. Certainly folks that
listen to this podcast are

186
00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:11.690
the kinds of folks who
could put together a machine.

187
00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:15.080
It's not just the pouring
it into a container, but

188
00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:17.180
the followup show we'll do.
We'll talk about what are

189
00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:18.470
the kinds of things we
can do to make it

190
00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:21.050
silent. Cool. There's a lot
of people out there that

191
00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:25.220
are focused on making silent
PCs. There's a great website@shrinks.com

192
00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:30.410
slash Q five to silent
PC review, silent PC review.com

193
00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:32.240
that has a lot of
focus on what can you

194
00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.970
do to find that balance
between performance and being silent.

195
00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:39.740
For example, I'm going with
a Western digital Raptor drive

196
00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:42.560
for my, for my main
system drive very nice. So

197
00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:47.360
thousand RPM drive and it
spins real loud, but there's

198
00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:50.240
techniques you can do to
dampen that kind of, that

199
00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:53.570
kind of sound that a
drive like that makes, for

200
00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:57.350
example, suspending it inside of
a, a container that has

201
00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:01.430
basically suspending an air via
rubber bands. Yeah. There's sound

202
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:05.750
is sound damping and vibration
damping kind of equipment that

203
00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:07.150
you can plug into it.
You can do it. I

204
00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:10.250
can just put it in
a closet. Yeah. You know,

205
00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:12.650
it's funny. I used to
do that once I took

206
00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:14.150
a box and I just
shoved it in the closet,

207
00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:16.130
the problem was it made
the closet really hot and

208
00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.380
that particular box would overheat
a lot. Right? Because I

209
00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:21.110
did a poor job of
doing the cooling right now.

210
00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:22.700
A lot of people have
been going back and forth

211
00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:27.140
on whether it developer machine
really needs raid and, you

212
00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:30.500
know, raid specifically for mirroring.
And I go back and

213
00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:34.640
forth on this myself, but
I already have a, a

214
00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:37.520
Western digital, one 50 on
my current machine. That was

215
00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.590
the very last piece of
hardware that I bought to

216
00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:42.260
make that machine faster. Right.
I thinking I'm going to

217
00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:45.980
take that drive once I've
brought everything over to the

218
00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:48.710
new system and I'm going
to end up mirroring my,

219
00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:51.860
my system drive. Cause there's
going to two things to

220
00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:54.850
worry about. There's the getting
the box back from the

221
00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:57.670
dead. Do you, do you
mirror it? Do you do

222
00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:59.710
raid on your system drive
so you can bring it

223
00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:02.620
back or the other option?
Of course, other than just

224
00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:05.290
doing raid, mirroring for your
system drivers to take images

225
00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:08.260
a lot with you use
something like Acronis true image,

226
00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:12.850
or whether you use a
windows home server, what is

227
00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:16.210
going to happen as a
developer when your machine dies,

228
00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:19.120
whether your C drive blows
up or whether your data

229
00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.710
drive blows up. So there's
kind of two different things

230
00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:23.200
to deal with there. I
do both. I would, I

231
00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:25.840
like raid, but I also
take images all the time.

232
00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:28.650
Speaking of rate and drives,
you should head on over

233
00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:34.230
to shrinks.com/oh four X and
check out the stack Zeus

234
00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:38.550
solid state drive, which is
a no moving parts. It's

235
00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:45.720
a flash drive. That's up
to 256 gigs. That'd be

236
00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:50.430
pretty expensive, pretty expensive. A
think, I remember Richard Campbell telling

237
00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:53.910
me that they are hoping
to get the price down

238
00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:59.700
to $2, a gigabyte by
2010 or something. And you

239
00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:02.310
know, that'll happen by 2009
or 2000, you know, end

240
00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:05.970
of next year, Right. But
it's over 200 times faster

241
00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:11.010
than a 15,000 RPM enterprise
hard disc drive. But you

242
00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:13.650
know, that's what happens when
you don't have any magnetic

243
00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:17.520
meetings. It's interesting that they're
making hard drives faster and

244
00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:22.890
faster. They're upping the MTBF
the meantime before failure, some

245
00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:26.070
drives have double the MTBF
of another drive. A number

246
00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:28.890
of people in the comments
said that I should get

247
00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:32.550
a little bit higher RPM
drive rather than the, the

248
00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:35.490
Raptor get the Mac store
Atlas, which is now at

249
00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:40.500
15,000 RPM. I didn't know.
So cheetah, it was we'll

250
00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:45.930
do 15,000 RPM. So for,
for really heavy IO, these,

251
00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:49.050
these particular drives are pretty
hardcore. It can do basically

252
00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:53.970
three, 400 megabytes a second,
theoretically. They also include a

253
00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:56.580
lot of cash, 16 Meg
cash on the, on the

254
00:13:56.580 --> 00:14:02.430
drive itself with only a
3.1 millisecond Sikh time. Wow.

255
00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:05.970
But here's where the balance
happens, right? A drive like

256
00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:09.810
that. It's going to cost
you, you know, 500, $600,

257
00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:11.730
right? Like for example, if
you were going to go

258
00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:15.930
and get an Atlas, you
might cost you 500 bucks.

259
00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:17.760
You want to do raid.
Then you suddenly, you're looking

260
00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:21.000
at more than the cost
of the entire system being

261
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.810
spent just on that. So
would you really get 50%

262
00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:27.750
more speed? You know, I
don't know, but from a,

263
00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:31.500
from a price performance balance,
the digital Russian digital rap

264
00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:34.050
tour, 10,000 RPM, perhaps about
200 bucks and you can

265
00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:38.390
find them around for one
75, if you hunt versus

266
00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:41.880
a five or $600 drive
with the 15,000 RPM also

267
00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:45.750
The faster they go, usually
the lower capacity they go

268
00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:48.630
up to. Yeah, the 15
thousands right now at, at

269
00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:50.880
one 50. And then the
Western digital for a long

270
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:56.600
was a 75 gig drive.
Now with the perpendicular configuration

271
00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:58.760
that they're using, they're able
to get more on that.

272
00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:00.770
But I know, I don't
know if I want my

273
00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:03.190
bits that close to each
other, frankly. Well, my machine

274
00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:09.460
actually has to wrap tour
15,000 RPM, 150 drives mirrored

275
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.890
as a RPM. I'm sorry,
10,000 RPM. Okay. Yes. Mirrored

276
00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:18.280
with onboard raid. So that
is my boot drive and

277
00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:21.010
that works well. It works
great. And you're using the

278
00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:23.410
builtin rate on the hardware
on the, on the, Yes

279
00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:26.530
I am, because I also
have a PCI express rate

280
00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:31.810
controller, but that's for the
data. Yeah. Interesting. Now for,

281
00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:34.120
for me on this particular
instance, I'm just going to

282
00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:36.400
have a data drive. That'll
be a kind of a

283
00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:39.670
standard Seagate Barracuda. It's only
a hundred dollars. It will

284
00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:42.010
be a 500 gig drive
and that'll just be, you

285
00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:45.070
know, D for data, right.
I've got a lot of

286
00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:49.420
external drives and, you know,
I used to hoard you

287
00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:52.510
video. I would have my
media center recording video and

288
00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:56.290
I use my computer as
a DVR. Right. I'm doing

289
00:15:56.290 --> 00:15:59.620
that less and less. And
I'm realizing that with things

290
00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:04.060
like blockbuster.com and Netflix, the
movies that I want to

291
00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:08.650
watch can be gotten quickly.
Yeah. There's no reason for

292
00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:11.140
me to hoard all this
stuff. So while I used

293
00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:12.760
to have, you know, a
terabyte and a half of

294
00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:15.310
this kind of stuff, all
my DVDs ripped onto the

295
00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:18.870
machine, it seems for me,
at least personally, the, the

296
00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:21.700
psychic weight of having to
worry about whether that data

297
00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:25.290
is backed up or, or
safe didn't become worth the

298
00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:28.660
benefit. So I'm finding less
and less that I need

299
00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:31.210
that kind of storage. And
now I'm just focusing on

300
00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:33.970
having images of all the
machines in my house backed

301
00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:35.890
up. That's right. It's more
important to me to be

302
00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:37.990
able to get my wife's
laptop back from the dead

303
00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:41.080
than it is for me
to, you know, hoard a

304
00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:43.870
video of DVDs that I
already have. Right. So let's

305
00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:47.200
talk about the processor that
you chose here. Yeah. This

306
00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:49.240
was an interesting one because
this is where I was

307
00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:53.440
not very educated about this,
but I wanted to find

308
00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:55.360
a processor that wasn't going
to be kind of like

309
00:16:55.360 --> 00:17:00.520
the, whatever, Intel selling $4,000
processor. Right. But I didn't

310
00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.620
want to just get a
standard core, two duo. I

311
00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:06.100
wanted something a little bit
more and Jeff suggested the

312
00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:11.680
core to quad Q 6,600,
Meaning it has four dies.

313
00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:15.610
Yeah. It's a F it's
a quad core. Holy crap

314
00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:18.850
processor. Now, when I bought
it, it was five 31

315
00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:23.260
it's already down to four,
four 98. And one of

316
00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:26.020
the tipsters in my, in
my blog post here said

317
00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:30.340
that the price of that
quad Q 6,600 is going

318
00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:34.690
down to two 66 on
July 22nd. Oh my goodness. So

319
00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:36.880
I jumped the gun and
it costs me 250 bucks,

320
00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:42.110
but the general impression is
that this is the, the

321
00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:44.830
processor to have, they're cutting
it in half again on

322
00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:47.980
July 22nd. And you'll be able
to, now, if you want

323
00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:51.780
it to, then you would
get B Corp to extreme.

324
00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:55.340
So that would be the
67. I never understood the

325
00:17:55.340 --> 00:18:01.280
difference between the regular Intel
chips and the extreme chips.

326
00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:05.210
Do you know the difference?
I don't hope hopefully someone

327
00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:07.310
will send us a note.
We'll get a flood of

328
00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:10.100
mail explaining what the difference
is. I really don't like

329
00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:13.610
the way that they do
these. I don't know any

330
00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:15.650
more. It doesn't make any
sense, mean maybe I'm an

331
00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:18.560
old school, but once I
figured out S you know,

332
00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:22.820
46 SX versus 46 DX,
I figured that all was

333
00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:25.610
right with the world. Right.
But now it's like the

334
00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:32.210
core two quad Q 6,600
versus the core to quad

335
00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:37.790
E 6,700. It's it's, it's
very confusing. Now. Some people

336
00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:41.570
argue that the four cores
aren't really necessary, but you

337
00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:43.610
know, if you've ever seen
me on a machine, I

338
00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:45.530
know you have, I tend
to have a lot of

339
00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:48.830
things going simultaneously. I switch
around a lot. You're very

340
00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:51.710
likely to fire a process
off in the background and

341
00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:54.680
then go and do something
else. I also sometimes do

342
00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:58.250
some kind of personal processor
farming where I'll actually pin

343
00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:01.790
a process down to a
processor. Yup. And then again,

344
00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:04.640
with orcas, having this notion
of a parallel build, you

345
00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:09.560
can get 25, 30% more
performance by running off multiple

346
00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:13.970
instances of ms. Build for
real large, real large builds.

347
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.550
So for me, that was
definitely a valuable thing. Well,

348
00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:18.580
I did spend too much
money because I didn't wait

349
00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:21.800
till July to buy it.
The word on the street

350
00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:24.140
is that that's, the process
should have. And according to

351
00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:28.550
Jeff, that along with the
MSI motherboard makes for a

352
00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:32.240
very overclocking friendly system. Okay.
So we might be able

353
00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:34.970
to get that 2.4 gigahertz
to go up to three,

354
00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:40.100
3.1, which could squeeze extreme
level speeds out of a

355
00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:43.790
non extreme, extreme processor. I'm
not so sure that you're

356
00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:46.340
going to, you're going to
see a big difference running

357
00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:49.850
a developer machine with that
change and in between what

358
00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:53.810
and what 2.4 and three
point, whatever. I'm not so

359
00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:56.180
sure you'll see a difference,
but, but it is interesting.

360
00:19:56.210 --> 00:19:58.730
I think maybe if you
were a gamer, you'd, you'd

361
00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:01.160
be more interested in that.
It tell me about the,

362
00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:04.820
the enormous heat sink cooler
thing that you got here.

363
00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:07.350
What is that all about?
Yeah. This is the size

364
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:10.640
of a new musical, a
Ninja, basically. It's a giant

365
00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:14.630
CPU cooler. I've got a
giant one on my system

366
00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:16.580
right now. It's like something
that you'd see at the

367
00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:19.850
Indianapolis 500, Absolutely huge. And
we had to do some

368
00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:22.730
measurements to make sure that
it would have room inside

369
00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:25.820
of the, the system, right?
It's it's got copper parts.

370
00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:30.950
It is real big. It's
a little bit less quality

371
00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:33.740
than the Zalman heat sinks,
which are very well thought

372
00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:38.570
of, right. But it's apparently
cools very, very well. It's

373
00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:41.510
huge, but it doesn't really
matter that it's huge because

374
00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:43.790
once it's mounted in there,
if it's mounted correctly, it

375
00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:46.910
doesn't put too much lateral
pressure on the, on the

376
00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:50.470
processor. One of the problems
with some of these giant

377
00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:52.810
CPU coolers are that they
don't really clip well to

378
00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:56.020
the motherboard. They can torque
the motherboard and also put

379
00:20:56.020 --> 00:21:00.810
a lot of lateral pressure
on the Be very careful

380
00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:02.370
in putting them in, you
know, one thing that I

381
00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:04.290
like about this, and I'm
just looking at the picture

382
00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:07.860
here is that it's got
pipes going up, either side

383
00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:13.230
into these radiator type heat
sinks, and they sandwich a

384
00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:16.170
fan. So there's a fan
in the middle. And then

385
00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:18.720
the heat sinks around eat
either side of that. So

386
00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:20.940
the, those things are getting
hot. And, and then of

387
00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:23.880
course the fan is cooling
them off directly. And this

388
00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:26.700
was a balance. I didn't
really feel like spending $150

389
00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:29.250
for a cooler. So for,
for $35, it's a pretty

390
00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:33.360
decent one. And it apparently
works very well. If you're,

391
00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:36.570
overclocking like an E like
a 6,600 and you overclock

392
00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:39.990
it to, to three gigahertz,
you can, you can get

393
00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:43.650
idle temperatures of about 30
Celsius, which is pretty reasonable

394
00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:47.340
and definitely cooler than my
current system runs. Now, again,

395
00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:49.560
it's huge, but it cools
the things down and it

396
00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:53.280
stays quiet. And that's really
the, the, the whole point

397
00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:55.230
is to kind of keep
that case temperature, keep that

398
00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:59.790
CPU temperature around 30 Celsius.
You went with a 520

399
00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:03.000
watt power supply. What was
your thinking there? Well, this,

400
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.420
this Corsair power supply is
also very well thought of,

401
00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:09.480
and I know that Jeff
has a lot of experience

402
00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:12.690
with this particular one. I
have a tendency to put

403
00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:16.500
a lot of drives in
my cases, even though I'm

404
00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:18.810
an external hard drive guy,
you might be. If I

405
00:22:18.810 --> 00:22:20.880
decided to do rate, I
might have four different drives

406
00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:24.180
in there along with two
pretty large video cards. I

407
00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:26.520
don't want to have any
chance that I'm not going

408
00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:29.700
to have enough wattage. Most
often you don't need this

409
00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:31.770
kind of, kind of water.
You can get away with

410
00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:34.290
300 Watch, but having more
as a safe thing to

411
00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:36.870
say In this case, having
more is pretty safe. It's

412
00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:40.530
got a very, very quiet,
quiet fan that varies. It's

413
00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:43.950
RPM based on temperature. It's
got a real nice modular

414
00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:48.330
cable that lets you basically
choose the, the cables that

415
00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:50.910
you want. They're very kind
of focused on just getting

416
00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:53.250
the job done. You use
just the cables you want

417
00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:55.290
no more, no less, as
opposed to having a big

418
00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:57.870
giant fan of cables that
pops out of it, that

419
00:22:57.870 --> 00:23:01.120
allows you to have much
better air flow in your,

420
00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:03.810
in your case, just use
the cables you need. One

421
00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:05.550
thing you should be careful
of when you're buying a

422
00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:07.800
power supply. If you're going
to get one that's big.

423
00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:10.440
And I mean, my power
supply, I don't mind telling

424
00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:14.670
you is a megawatt. Wow,
it's a thousand Watts. And

425
00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:17.010
I had a problem with
it because it was so

426
00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:20.790
long that it, it was,
it was like solving one

427
00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:24.090
of those puzzles that Delaware
always has at their booth

428
00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:27.120
at, at, you know, the,
the shows that they have

429
00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:29.670
those little logic puzzles. They're
like things that are interlocked

430
00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:32.400
and only by twisting them
together in the right way

431
00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:35.190
and moving your hands a
certain way. Can you, can

432
00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:39.030
you take them apart? That's
what the experience was like,

433
00:23:39.030 --> 00:23:42.660
getting this in the case,
it barely fit and be

434
00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:45.410
loud. No, it's not loud
at all, but it just

435
00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:48.350
big. And even though it
was a big case, you

436
00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:50.810
know, the openings that were
available for me to put

437
00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:53.630
things in, it just was
a little too big for

438
00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:55.840
it. So yeah, but I
didn't get it in. This

439
00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:59.140
is a pretty comfortable size.
And with the 520 Watts,

440
00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:00.550
it's going to give me
enough power to do whatever

441
00:24:00.550 --> 00:24:03.160
kind of overclocking I need.
And it's also very well

442
00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:06.730
thought of as a very
quiet power supply. And even

443
00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:09.730
though it's twice as much
as your average off the

444
00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:12.670
street power supply, I don't
think that a power supply

445
00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:16.690
is a place you want
to really, I agree. Skimp.

446
00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:18.610
No. Yeah. You don't want
to take a chance. You

447
00:24:18.610 --> 00:24:21.550
know, you've mentioned overclocking now
three or four times, and

448
00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:25.000
I'm curious as to why
you think you're going to

449
00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.360
be needing to overclock. I
don't think I'm needing to

450
00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:31.330
overclock, but I don't want
to spend a thousand dollars

451
00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:35.590
on a processor to get
the kind of performance that

452
00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:40.300
I need. And I feel
like conservative overclocking and still

453
00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:44.920
getting a great deal of
stability is just free speed.

454
00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:48.730
You know, even if you're
only getting 15, 20% more,

455
00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:51.400
more speed out of it,
if you can get the

456
00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:53.860
thing, rock solid, if you
can run something like a

457
00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:56.950
prime 95 or one of
those benchmarks and run the

458
00:24:56.950 --> 00:25:00.850
thing really, really hot for
two, three days and have

459
00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:03.430
it not blue screen on
you have a no trouble

460
00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:06.400
at all, have no stability
issues, then why wouldn't you

461
00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:09.790
want to? Well, I dunno,
I just, the, the, the

462
00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:12.370
audit is something about that
just strikes me as a

463
00:25:12.370 --> 00:25:15.670
little bit odd that, you
know, for a developer machine,

464
00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:18.340
do you really need to
take the risk? And that's

465
00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:21.250
what you're really doing. The
manufacturer has set the speed

466
00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:24.370
saying this is a safe
speed for this processor. You

467
00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:27.460
know, it, when you overclock,
you're just sort of tempting

468
00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:29.330
fate. I think so. I
don't know. I don't know.

469
00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:31.840
Yeah. I under, I understand
your point of view from,

470
00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:33.910
from my point of view,
it was about the fastest

471
00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:37.060
developer rig that I could
get for this price performance

472
00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:41.260
ratio. And for me, a
very conservative over clock gave

473
00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:44.710
me the performance I wanted
without increasing the price. Right.

474
00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:46.540
I would just, I would
just recommend you try it

475
00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:50.500
without overclocking first and I'll
do I'll do benchmarks both

476
00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:52.480
ways. I actually did. Absolutely.
And then of course, when,

477
00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:54.550
when doing overclocking, you want
to make sure that not

478
00:25:54.550 --> 00:25:57.880
only does the, is the
processor well known for doing

479
00:25:58.330 --> 00:26:02.080
for overclocking well, is the
motherboard friendly to the over

480
00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:05.350
clocker? Does the power supply
provide the right amount of

481
00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:07.420
voltage to be able to
do that? Right. And do

482
00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:10.270
you have memory that will
appreciate that kind of overclocking

483
00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:14.230
some memory is not, overclocking
friendly. Also some memory requires

484
00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:17.530
a little bit more voltage
than the average motherboard wants

485
00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:19.690
to give it. So we
have to think about those

486
00:26:19.690 --> 00:26:23.080
kinds of things when, when
making these decisions. Yep. And

487
00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:26.290
then we just ended it
up with some, some Kingston

488
00:26:26.290 --> 00:26:29.560
Ram. We're going to get
four gigs just in case

489
00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:31.960
I want to run 64
bit just going to get

490
00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:36.280
for one gig sticks, very
inexpensive, only $200. That's interesting.

491
00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:38.500
It looks like good Ram
and you know, the reviews

492
00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:41.500
are pretty good. So Yeah.
You know, everyone's got opinions

493
00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:44.700
about these kinds of things.
Either. You don't want to

494
00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:46.530
skimp, but at the same
time, you don't want to

495
00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:49.470
spend double if you don't
have to. So, you know,

496
00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:52.560
fortunately with, with a building
assistant out of components like

497
00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:55.440
this worst case scenario just
means that I'll have to

498
00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:58.440
find another component. Of course,
the option would've been to

499
00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:01.650
go with a Dell otherwise.
But I, I liked the,

500
00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:05.070
the benefit that this kind
of modular design gives me

501
00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:07.170
if this Ram doesn't work
out, I'll get something else,

502
00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:11.470
right. You live in, you
learn, All right, Scott, let's

503
00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:14.510
save the best for last
year video card. I see

504
00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:18.200
it's a PCI express 16,
which right there tells you,

505
00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:22.070
this is a serious video
card. Anybody who's doing getting

506
00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:24.050
a new video card these
days is, should be looking

507
00:27:24.050 --> 00:27:27.620
at PCI express 16. Yeah.
Yeah. This is a pretty

508
00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:31.880
decent balance. This is a,
a, a G-Force 8,600 it's

509
00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:35.990
256 Meg card. It's not,
you know, a super duper

510
00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:40.190
$500 video card, but it
is a pretty serious video

511
00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:44.540
card. It's it's basically say
on NVIDIA's 8,600 GTS core,

512
00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:48.020
it's a dual width PCI
express card. So it's a,

513
00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:52.760
it's a big, big card.
It's got two DVI outputs.

514
00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:56.480
So one video card will
run two monitors, happily and

515
00:27:56.480 --> 00:28:00.560
both. So those are our
dual link. Right? Right. Well,

516
00:28:00.790 --> 00:28:04.040
well, yeah, the, the DVI
is our dual link. Yes,

517
00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:05.960
yes. Sorry. I always think
that I was thinking you

518
00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:08.660
were referring to SLI because
we're getting two of these

519
00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:11.540
cards. They're about one 50
each. Right. And a lot

520
00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:14.540
of folks assumed when we
put two cards in the

521
00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:18.620
spec that we were talking
about running the SLI, right.

522
00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:21.920
That would give you a,
some, some pretty serious performance

523
00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:26.090
for a pretty, pretty decent
price. But for us, it

524
00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:29.870
was about running four monitors,
right. About linking them. Or

525
00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:34.040
you could actually run to
a 30 inch monitors like

526
00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:36.470
the, the Dell or Apple
30 inch monitors, which are

527
00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:38.420
right now. I think some
of the biggest monitors you

528
00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:41.720
can get. Yeah. Pretty cool.
If you want to do

529
00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:44.750
that. So, so how many
monitors do you plan to

530
00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:47.690
run with this thing Right
now at home, I've got

531
00:28:47.690 --> 00:28:51.830
two, but I'm considering getting
two more, a 22 inch

532
00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:55.160
flat screens and putting them
on the, on the right

533
00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:57.260
hand side. Right. And left
hand side respectably and kind

534
00:28:57.260 --> 00:29:01.520
of bracketing my current dual
monitor system. It's interesting. You

535
00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:05.480
know, I have a single
Dell, 30 inch display and

536
00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:08.990
I don't, I find that
I'm, I don't miss having

537
00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:11.210
two monitors, you know, having
that little bump in the

538
00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:13.400
middle and having to physically
move my head a lot.

539
00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:19.220
But you know, with 25,
60 by 1600 resolution, you

540
00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:20.960
can pretty get pretty much
get a lot of stuff

541
00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:22.340
in there. But, you know,
I can't say that. I

542
00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:24.440
wouldn't like to have another
one. Know it really is

543
00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:26.390
a kind of a religious
argument. A lot of people

544
00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:29.540
think why not have just
a giant 30 inch when

545
00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:31.550
I was visiting the guy,
some guys up in Seattle,

546
00:29:31.550 --> 00:29:35.840
they had one giant 30
inch widescreen Dell, and they

547
00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:39.170
had two 20 twos turned
on their side so that

548
00:29:39.170 --> 00:29:41.860
their width was the same
height as the inch. Yeah.

549
00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:43.510
And they would have them
left and right. So they

550
00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:46.090
had a total of three
monitors. That's what Richard Campbell has.

551
00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:47.950
That's the setup. It just
seems like a really nice

552
00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:51.670
balance. Yep. Other thing I
like about this particular card,

553
00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:55.600
this is from MSI is
it's already overclocked Hmm. They've

554
00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:59.860
got a, a big, a
cooler attached to the thing.

555
00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:02.890
Yeah. And there's ways to
make the fan silent because

556
00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:05.710
a video card fan has
a tendency to make these

557
00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:09.550
things really, really loud. What
you can do is you

558
00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:12.580
can others tips actually in
the, in the reviews of

559
00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:15.820
this particular card, up on
Newegg, where you can kind

560
00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:17.920
of fool around with the
way that the fan plugs

561
00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:20.590
into the card and you
can get the, the fan

562
00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:25.090
running slower, it sort of
runs silently or darn near

563
00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:28.870
silent. Yep. So it not
only overclocks nicely, but it's

564
00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:31.120
got a pretty decent cooler
of its own that they've

565
00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:34.270
added on to the, to
the reference design. So it

566
00:30:34.270 --> 00:30:36.250
seemed like a real, a
good balance. You know, I'm

567
00:30:36.250 --> 00:30:38.710
not someone who's going to
spend the amount of money

568
00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:41.500
I spent on my Xbox
on a single video card.

569
00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:43.930
But when I play the
occasional game, I'd like it

570
00:30:43.930 --> 00:30:46.390
to work. But additionally, if
I'm going to have all

571
00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:48.850
the eye candy of a
Vista, I don't want to

572
00:30:48.850 --> 00:30:52.270
have to think about, I
agree. We know cost. Why

573
00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:54.490
is an arrow fast enough
if I minimize a window,

574
00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:56.050
why, you know, dammit, I
want that video or that

575
00:30:56.050 --> 00:30:58.870
window to go, boom. Right.
And one of my work,

576
00:30:59.050 --> 00:31:02.470
yeah, right now my ATI
Raytheon is just really struggling

577
00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:05.140
with, with, with arrow. And
I'm pretty much had it

578
00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:07.960
with ATI at this point.
Well, Scott, that's a, it's

579
00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:09.550
been a great show. I
mean, we don't usually talk

580
00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:12.550
about hardware like this, but
I find it. I find

581
00:31:12.550 --> 00:31:14.170
it cool to just take
a look and see what

582
00:31:14.170 --> 00:31:16.300
the state of the art
is. So thanks for that.

583
00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:18.670
And we'll have to catch
up later after you get

584
00:31:18.670 --> 00:31:20.500
it and have been running
it for a few weeks

585
00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:23.080
and let us know how
it works. Yeah. And I

586
00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:26.680
would really encourage listeners to
send in their opinions because,

587
00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:28.270
you know, I don't claim
in any way to be

588
00:31:28.270 --> 00:31:30.310
an expert on this kind
of stuff. I'm just a

589
00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:33.760
guy who reads a lot.
I trust Jeff, we've gone

590
00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:36.860
back and forth in the
assembling of this machine. He,

591
00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:40.570
he cares about the overclocking
and getting it right with

592
00:31:40.570 --> 00:31:42.490
it with a level of
passion and detail that I

593
00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:45.700
don't necessarily share. I wanted
to find a machine that

594
00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:49.060
wasn't just a stock Dell
that had had some future

595
00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:51.130
proofing to it. That was
a good balance. I think

596
00:31:51.130 --> 00:31:53.470
I've put together a pretty
decent machine. I know that

597
00:31:53.470 --> 00:31:54.940
a lot of our listeners
are putting together their own

598
00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:56.830
machine. So I'm really interested
in what they've come up

599
00:31:56.830 --> 00:31:58.960
with to squeeze that last
little bit of speed out

600
00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:02.590
of a development. Awesome. With
that, we'll see you next

601
00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:03.790
week on Hanselman's.
