Hi, this is Scott Hanselman.

8
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.960
This is another episode of
Hansel minutes. Today. I'm talking

9
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.290
with Cindy Alvarez. She is
the author of lean customer

10
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.040
development building products. Your customers
will buy look at all

11
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.800
those stars you've got on
Amazon. This is doing really

12
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.770
well. Congratulations. Thank you. It's
good to be here today.

13
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.800
This is cool. So when
did the book come out?

14
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.770
A couple of years ago,
right? Yeah. Book came out

15
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.390
in July of 2014 And
it's over at O'Reilly and

16
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.150
I work on the Oz
con conference, but was, is

17
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.510
also O'Reilly but not related.
It's just a coincidence that

18
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.850
you're an O'Reilly author. And
I have a relationship with

19
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.970
a Riley just to put
that out front, but I

20
00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.940
was recommended your book from
John Montgomery, our shared one of

21
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.060
our shared bosses up the,
up the chain there. So

22
00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.380
I'm excited to, to chat
with you about this. So

23
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.560
let's kick it off. This.
John actually went and bought

24
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.840
like a ton of these
books and started passing it

25
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.300
around. So he is your
fan. The, the name lean

26
00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.330
on the book cover is
big because lean is a,

27
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.210
is like a topic right
now. Like lean software lean.

28
00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.520
I had Tom and Mary
poppin Dick, come on and

29
00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.810
talk about lean processes. How
is this a buzzword? Is

30
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.760
this being used as a
buzz word or is this

31
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:10.100
mean something more than just
a buzz word? So yes

32
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.820
and no. The, the funny
thing is actually the reason

33
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.930
the title is lean customer
development is because the O'Reilly

34
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.770
series of books all started
with lean customer development is

35
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.910
one of the tenants of
Eric Reese's original lean startup

36
00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.590
philosophy. There's no such thing
as non lean customer development.

37
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.420
I mean, I guess there
could be, but it's not

38
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.730
as though there was an
existing thing that this is

39
00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.950
different from, but lean in
general is a sense of

40
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.670
not wanting to waste, to
wanting to learn as quickly

41
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.610
as possible. And some of
you may be familiar with,

42
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.370
you know, from the lean
startup book, the notion of

43
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.150
learn, measure, build. And so
the title, the subtitle of

44
00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.890
the book really kind of
gets at that is we

45
00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.140
don't want to be building
things that no one wants.

46
00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.650
We don't want to build
things that people aren't going

47
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.080
to buy. We don't want
to build things that we're

48
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.330
going to get stuck supporting
for years that don't really

49
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.840
meet customer's needs. So in
that sense, lean is its

50
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.710
own kind of thing. And
I think the tenants that,

51
00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.160
that make it not buzzwordy
are the notion that we

52
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.250
have to go in being
prepared to be wrong. And

53
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.970
that means we have hypotheses
and we, we work to

54
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.570
disprove them. And our goal
really is to disprove ourselves

55
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.070
as often as possible, which
is pretty uncomfortable. So one

56
00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.470
of the things that you
said there was a hypothesis,

57
00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.130
like having a hypothesis is
important. Like without one, it

58
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.310
can't be validated or invalidated.
Right? And I think a

59
00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.150
lot of people believe that
they have a hypothesis because

60
00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.400
how could you, how could
you build a product without

61
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.830
one, right? That's kind of
the starting point where I

62
00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.510
usually come in and talk
to people and they say,

63
00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.120
well, of course we have
a hypothesis. And I found

64
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.790
it's really interesting to have
people do a sticky note

65
00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.940
exercise where you say, okay,
what is the measure of

66
00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.850
success for this product? Like
this product will succeed if

67
00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.360
it does X or what
will our customers find most

68
00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.720
valuable about our product? And
when you do that, and

69
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.390
you have people who've been
working on a team together,

70
00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.290
even co located for months,
they will write down different

71
00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.600
things on that piece of
paper. And so there's always

72
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.780
these assumed hypotheses and on
a team of 10 people,

73
00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.590
you probably have 10 different
hypotheses and, and no one

74
00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.200
is actually actively trying to
disprove them because why would

75
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.110
we want to do that?
That's super uncomfortable. Wow. That

76
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.500
seems like, like, I believe
you. But at the same

77
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.050
time, I'm like, that's impossible.
Like how could we all

78
00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.060
not be in the same
room or on the same

79
00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.390
team or in the same
Slack and not be generally

80
00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.030
marching in the same direction
or putting all, as they

81
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.640
say, putting all the wood
behind one arrow. You're saying

82
00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.960
that unless we actually assert
those assumptions, we might all

83
00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.890
be heading in slightly different
directions, generally the same direction,

84
00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:55.500
but slightly different. Yeah. And
then there'll be slightly different

85
00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.250
directions. There'll be things like,
for example, for any product,

86
00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.320
there's several different customer types.
And one person might have

87
00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.530
a belief that this customer
type is by far the

88
00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:11.550
most important, and this customer
type is less important, but

89
00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.700
still important. And these people
are maybe a future market,

90
00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.950
but not that important. And
the person next to them

91
00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.370
will put those weightings just
a little bit different. And

92
00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.370
even if you're just off
by 5%, that might make

93
00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.850
the difference between choosing to
invest in a feature that

94
00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.550
isn't really gonna pay off
for you and your team,

95
00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:33.300
because it's the least important
customers who benefit from it.

96
00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.490
And it might even be
actively bad for your best

97
00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:40.680
customers. And so kind of
constantly questioning that and having

98
00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.350
people assert this is what
we believe. And this is

99
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:47.250
why saves a ton of
time later on You, you

100
00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.020
said a couple of words
there though that were kind

101
00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.980
of like subjective adjectives. Like
what are our best customers?

102
00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.100
How do you measure something
like that? Sure. So we

103
00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.730
all want jobs. So our
best customers are people who

104
00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:03.230
use our products and pay
us for those products. So,

105
00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:05.930
I mean, that's, that's basically
it. So in the case

106
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.980
of something like Yammer, which
is where until recently I

107
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.220
worked that's part of office
three 65. So we don't

108
00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:17.540
have a standalone sort of
set of people purchasing this

109
00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:20.030
and not other things. But
so we look at usage

110
00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:23.450
for people who are selling
individual skews, it might be

111
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:27.760
usage. It might be downloads.
If you build apps for

112
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.470
the app store, it may
be in game purchases. Your

113
00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:33.890
best customers are the people
who are buying 1200 polka

114
00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:36.860
coins. You know, every week,
they're not the people who

115
00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.560
have never spent money. And
those people are useful in

116
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.770
terms of spreading buzz. But
after a certain point, buzz

117
00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:46.240
does not pay our salaries.
But it seems like if

118
00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.870
you, if you look at
what people do on what,

119
00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:52.770
like we just switched Snapchat,
just sold for like a

120
00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:56.110
jillion dollars. Right. But no
one was paying them those.

121
00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:59.230
So they're going, based on
the power of a ton

122
00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:01.600
of people use us, which
I don't know if that's

123
00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.110
power or not. That's just
the step one, get a

124
00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:09.070
bunch of customers, step two
profit. Right. And that's a

125
00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:12.280
bet that doesn't pay off
for very many companies. But

126
00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.470
when it does, it pays
off tremendously. If you think

127
00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:17.920
of Facebook initially, no one
was paying anyone for that.

128
00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:21.190
Now they make a ton
of money on advertising, targeting,

129
00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.730
possibly swung and election. Recently,
a lot of power came

130
00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:27.910
out of that, but you
know, I've been in the

131
00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:30.190
software industry long enough to
have seen a lot of

132
00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:33.040
companies who did that will
build an audience and then

133
00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:37.510
monetize it later somehow and
most of the March. Okay.

134
00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:40.030
So that's a risky way
to do things. Ultimately people

135
00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:42.070
do have to pay and
you have to optimize for

136
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:45.580
those. So you want to
make the, you want to

137
00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:49.060
make the people you want
to make acquisition easy and

138
00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:51.850
then, but still optimize for
those that are paying. Sure.

139
00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:56.770
I would also say that
in the case of Snapchat,

140
00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:00.070
they may be looking at
the type of audience they

141
00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:02.350
have to. So the other
thing is not just that

142
00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:05.410
in most cases you want
people to be paying, but

143
00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:07.540
there's the saying that if
you're not paying for something,

144
00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:10.390
you are the product. So
if the consumers of a

145
00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:13.600
particular product are particularly valuable,
that's more likely to pay

146
00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.790
off as well. And so
in that case, you might

147
00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:19.240
be looking at the usage
of are these millennial teens

148
00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:21.010
that we expect to have
a lot of buying power.

149
00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:26.440
Soon in that case, they're
more attractive audience than maybe,

150
00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:29.660
you know, lower income middle-aged
folks who are unlikely to,

151
00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:32.520
to change their socioeconomic status.
I don't know. That's, that's

152
00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:35.920
getting more into pricing and
economics than my normal forte,

153
00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:38.680
but Sure, sure. But it
does like it, it's good

154
00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:41.440
to put this in the
context, maybe not of pricing,

155
00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:44.200
but rather a cust products
that we use. Like, I

156
00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.820
know, I know a ton
of people that are excited

157
00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:50.050
about Slack and use it,
but I don't know. I

158
00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:52.000
don't know if I know
anyone, like, we all use

159
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.040
it for free. Like we
use the free one, you

160
00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.040
know, like, I don't know
a lot of people throwing

161
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:59.940
money at Slack as an
example. So when you getting

162
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:01.680
this back to what we
w where it started, which

163
00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:06.450
was best customers, right? How
do you measure that? And

164
00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:10.470
then it also gets me
thinking about the best aren't

165
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:16.110
necessarily the loudest customers. Absolutely.
Yeah. I see a lot

166
00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:20.690
of people chasing loud customers
Because they're right there. The

167
00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:24.770
it's, it's so easy to
hear from vocal customers. And

168
00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:28.940
sometimes they coincide with best.
Sometimes they coincide with the

169
00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:31.250
people who are paying us
a lot of money, but

170
00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:34.220
who may not actually be
that devoted to our product.

171
00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:37.610
But what we want to
look at is are they,

172
00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:40.580
are they the best in
terms of, as our market

173
00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:43.160
grows, they're going to continue
to be with us. And

174
00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.970
also are they representative? So,
you know, especially in the

175
00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:49.430
startup world where I came
from, a lot of times

176
00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:52.790
you get one blue chip
customer who was the kind

177
00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:55.160
of person you'd be excited
to put the logo, their

178
00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.380
company logo on your website.
Like, yes, we've made it.

179
00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:00.560
We have, you know, whoever
it is, we have Nintendo,

180
00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:04.220
we have fidelity, we have
America online. I kind of

181
00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:07.130
dated myself there. But anyways,
you have one of those

182
00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:09.590
customers. Who's paying you a
lot of money that everyone

183
00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:13.070
has heard of. And it's,
it serves to legitimize your

184
00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:18.710
business, but their needs may
be incredibly non-representative. And so

185
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:22.070
you want to build things
to make that customer happy,

186
00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:26.780
which ends up making your
product much less good and

187
00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:30.590
usable and compelling for other
audiences. And I've definitely been

188
00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:34.520
at startups where we chased
that one customer who kept

189
00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:37.970
wanting things that were uniquely
suited to their business, that

190
00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:43.160
actually were detriments to other
people, adopting the product. Exactly.

191
00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.190
I think that, that there
are, there are these charged

192
00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:52.550
words, like best and right,
that can, can send one

193
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:54.650
in the wrong direction, especially
if you're a startup and

194
00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:58.580
you, and you get like
the one customer, you end

195
00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:03.440
up building the product for
them. And like internally, you

196
00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:06.170
know, we do this thing
called dogfooding at Microsoft where

197
00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:08.960
we'll go and like get
a customer that dog foods

198
00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:11.120
or eats their own dog
food. And the next thing

199
00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:13.400
you know, are you building
the.net framework or are you

200
00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:17.300
building a really great runtime
for Xbox to use? Yes.

201
00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:22.040
So what's what is best
and what is right. Can

202
00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:26.330
make the door. You can
fool yourself into thinking that

203
00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:28.730
you've validated your hypothesis, but
you really just found a

204
00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:31.970
great customer. Who's excited about
your product, but that's not

205
00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:36.680
the right thing for, for
real people. Now you're making

206
00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:39.650
me worried about all of
my adjectives, like best and

207
00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:43.610
real and right. Like I'm
having the same effect. And

208
00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:46.970
it makes me laugh because,
you know, I have managed

209
00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:49.490
researchers for the past few
years and I always caution

210
00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:53.830
them about saying everyone or
all to be XR, sample

211
00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:57.310
sizes are small. You cannot
say everyone is confused by

212
00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:00.040
this because we know that
that can't possibly be true.

213
00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:02.560
And it just gives people
an opening to like pick

214
00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:05.590
at the rest of your
methodology. So it's many people

215
00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:08.860
we keep talking to people
who say this, the softener

216
00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:13.780
words actually are very useful,
but I think, you know,

217
00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:16.300
that customer that's in front
of us, you know, I

218
00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:19.240
kind of want to bring
it back to hypothesis, right?

219
00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:22.300
If you look at the
rest of science, you can't

220
00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:26.830
have a hypothesis and prove
it in one limited context

221
00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:29.950
and declare it a success
that doesn't work for FDA

222
00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:32.500
trials, it doesn't work for,
you know, creating a light

223
00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:35.800
bulb or anything like that.
So it's where I keep

224
00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:39.160
pulling it back to that
hypothesis. You know, you can

225
00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:42.160
never prove a hypothesis. You
can elevate it to a

226
00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:44.560
theory, but there's always a
chance that something will come

227
00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:48.070
along. And so when we
put a product in front

228
00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:52.000
of one customer, or even
several customers that are very

229
00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:56.470
tightly United in terms of
their behavior, we can't necessarily

230
00:12:56.470 --> 00:13:00.520
extrapolate that out to a
big market. And so that's

231
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:03.250
where we take that notion
of trying to disprove it.

232
00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:06.520
So if we say, look,
X-Box loves this framework. It's

233
00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:10.960
amazing. They're there, they're an,
obviously a really impressive customer.

234
00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:13.840
We've got really smart people
using it. Let's keep doing

235
00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:17.290
more of this. You know,
the lean methodology says, this

236
00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:20.020
is where someone should say,
wait a second, we should

237
00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:24.550
disprove this. We should find
other customers that are like,

238
00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:27.460
X-Box to see if they
still like our product. We

239
00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:30.760
should find customers who are
equally attractive in terms of

240
00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:33.610
how much they could be
using the product and paying

241
00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:36.220
us, but who are not
X-Box. And we should see

242
00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:39.160
what they do. We should
see how they behave, because

243
00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:43.180
it's possible that if we
took this framework that X-Box

244
00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:45.670
is using and put it
in front of, you know,

245
00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:48.010
an Nvidia or a, you
know, even a, you know,

246
00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:50.680
a hedge fund trader or
someone like that, that they

247
00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:52.510
would say, this is crap.
We're never going to use

248
00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:55.900
this. And you know, a
business cannot sustain on that

249
00:13:55.900 --> 00:14:00.060
one blue chip customer. So
then the, so then parsing

250
00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:01.950
that this was good. This
is very helpful to me,

251
00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:05.820
the parsing validate or invalidate,
is it a matter, like

252
00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:09.960
you can invalidate a, a
hypothesis from a scientific perspective,

253
00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:15.090
you can invalidate theories and
you can use those invalidations

254
00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:19.830
as weapons to invalidate entire
products and say, well, we're

255
00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:22.650
in completely the wrong direction.
Does that work in a

256
00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:26.460
customer and product development fashion?
Can you say, Nope, we've

257
00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:30.900
just invalidated everything like it
all stops now or does

258
00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:33.120
it just mean, well, that's
just, that's not going to

259
00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:36.240
work for those customers, Right?
I, I have never seen

260
00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:38.640
it come to a full
stop in an enterprise and

261
00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:43.740
it probably never will. I
have seen, for example, I

262
00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:46.680
do a lot of startup
mentoring and I've seen startups

263
00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:50.910
where they entirely pivoted because
they don't yet have products

264
00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:53.540
for, and they went out
and they talked to 20

265
00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:56.480
people who represented what they
thought was their best market

266
00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.700
and said, man, none of
these people are going to

267
00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:00.830
pay us for this. You
know, I just quit my

268
00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:04.220
day job. I can't, I
can't pursue something that none

269
00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:07.100
of my target customers want
or better yet. People who

270
00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:09.140
say I'm not going to
quit my day job because

271
00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:12.470
I don't think I have
anything here yet. So I've

272
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:16.490
definitely seen entire things pivot
or be scrapped based on

273
00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:22.340
this methodology where when you
get into either at a

274
00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:25.730
small existing company or, you
know, certainly in a Microsoft

275
00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:29.720
sized company, you might invalidate
something. You might say, look,

276
00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:34.370
the majority of developers today
are making these decisions. That

277
00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:37.280
doesn't mean you can stop
developing something legacy. That's been

278
00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:40.880
around for 10 or 20
years. Because even that diminishing

279
00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:45.050
population is still paying you
money and still having value.

280
00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:49.280
What it can do is
change the percentages of where

281
00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:53.600
you're investing time. So back
to those vocal customers, if

282
00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:57.320
they represent an edge case
of your future business, okay,

283
00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:00.170
they're really loud. They're paying
us a lot, but we

284
00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:02.870
think going forward, they're going
to be a diminishing part

285
00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:06.230
of our market. In that
case, you might say, we're

286
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:10.790
going to invest 15% of
our time in the things

287
00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:14.810
they want and put 85%
on newer things or, you

288
00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:18.410
know, fill in your own
percentages, but it helps adjust

289
00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:22.750
those percentages to where your
best opportunity cost is. So

290
00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:26.770
how do you find a
balance between interviews, which often

291
00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:29.140
get referred to as like
I've heard them term for

292
00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:33.880
Betamax or anecdotes. Sometimes people
use those as data and

293
00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:35.890
they imply like, this is
a fact we're like, no,

294
00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:39.010
that's an interview. And that's
a thing someone said, how

295
00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:42.460
do you balance that with,
with telemetry and then more

296
00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:46.660
generalized customer feedback, which isn't
in a formal one-on-one interview.

297
00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:53.110
Sure. So I treat interviews
as a risk reduction tool

298
00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:55.870
initially. So what you're trying
to do is make sure

299
00:16:55.870 --> 00:17:00.940
that we're not making any
obviously wrong mistakes. And because

300
00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:03.100
we assume that we're not
going to make obviously wrong

301
00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:05.890
mistakes, that sometimes that's tough
for people to get their

302
00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:08.410
heads around. I say, well,
you know, we're smart people.

303
00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:11.800
We're not going to make
these obvious mistakes. And rather

304
00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:14.380
than try to argue that
point, I usually just have

305
00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:16.660
people join me on a
customer call and ask them

306
00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:18.550
to take notes. And then
at the end of it,

307
00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:21.310
typically they say, Whoa, we
were really wrong about a

308
00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:25.990
lot of things. So interviews
are a great way of

309
00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:29.290
making sure that you're not
making big, obvious mistakes. It's

310
00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:32.020
also a really good way
of looking at things that

311
00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:35.350
telemetry will never be able
to answer for you, which

312
00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:39.550
is essentially why, why did
someone do that? You can

313
00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:43.540
make inferences based on data,
but they're often wrong. Whereas

314
00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:47.860
if you watch someone do
something, set a configuration, automate

315
00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:51.710
something, make a decision, and
you, you kind of asked

316
00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:54.780
them questions around, how did
you make that decision? Or

317
00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:57.690
how, how have you done
this in the past? You

318
00:17:57.690 --> 00:18:00.330
realize that there's a lot
of why things that weren't

319
00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:02.610
coming through. So you're never
going to get that out

320
00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:05.820
of telemetry. And the other
thing is that the interviews

321
00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:08.220
are often kind of these
canaries in a coal mine.

322
00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:11.820
So a lot of times
when I've done interviews for

323
00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:15.360
Yammer and past products, I
would hear things from customers

324
00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:18.570
that were very surprising. And
I wanted to make sure

325
00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:20.700
that I didn't just talk
to five weird people in

326
00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:23.100
a row. And so that's
generally when I would look

327
00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:26.730
to the data, either myself
or to a data analyst

328
00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:29.040
and kind of say, we've
heard a lot of people

329
00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:32.610
complaining about this area of
the product. Is there anything

330
00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:35.760
that in our usage patterns
that suggests that this is

331
00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:38.580
a big pattern, you know,
are people who use this

332
00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:41.340
part of the product, less
likely to come back? Are

333
00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:44.760
they less likely to post
on Yammer? And a lot

334
00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:46.770
of times our data analysts
were able to run some

335
00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:49.650
queries and say, you know,
yeah, there's some, there's some,

336
00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:55.410
they're there. For example, people
who used Yammer and actually

337
00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:58.470
rated it highly, they said,
we love this thing. We'd

338
00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:01.020
ask them what was the
last thing you posted? And

339
00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:03.390
they would say, Oh, I
don't post. I, you know,

340
00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:06.390
I'm, I'm kind of reluctant
to post some people actually

341
00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:09.450
use the word scared. And
when I brought that back

342
00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:12.450
to the product team originally,
you know, there was almost

343
00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:18.540
some derision like scared to
post that's ridiculous. And I

344
00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:20.280
thought about this and I
thought, well, how can we

345
00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:23.010
prove that this is true?
We, you know, seeing as

346
00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:27.060
we can't look into people's
content and working with our

347
00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:31.320
analytics, we found that posting
rates, the, the odds of

348
00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:34.140
whether a single person was
likely to post or not,

349
00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:38.340
we're incredibly higher in private
groups and incredibly higher in

350
00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:42.270
small groups. And both of
those combined with some of

351
00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:45.450
these verbatims made a really
strong case that, yeah, people

352
00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:49.230
don't want to look stupid
and they're afraid that posting

353
00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:52.230
is going to make them
look stupid because they don't

354
00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:53.850
actually know who's going to
read it or how it's

355
00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:56.430
going to be interpreted. And
so that actually led to

356
00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:59.280
some changes in the product
to help make it feel

357
00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:01.830
like a smaller, you know,
more team based kind of

358
00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:06.500
product. I see. So someone
would, it's like, I, I'm

359
00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:09.140
often afraid that I'm going
to send something to more

360
00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:11.510
than a certain amount of
people. So I like it

361
00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:14.120
when I, like, if I
put a bunch of distribution

362
00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:17.450
lists or groups on outlook,
outlook as a little thing

363
00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:19.490
that pops up that says,
you're about to send this

364
00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:21.710
to 4,000 people by adding
up all of the different

365
00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:25.160
people. Right. And I love
that. Yeah. That's a, that's

366
00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:27.740
a great preventing you from
feeling stupid. Kind of a

367
00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:30.350
kind of tool Also gets
to that point though, of

368
00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:32.750
like you are, this is
a talk to everyone in

369
00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:35.030
the company tool and people
are afraid to use it

370
00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:36.740
because they don't want to
talk to everyone in the

371
00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:41.540
company. Yeah. And because people
have seen words, twisted people

372
00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:43.910
have seen casual, Oh, we
could probably do that in

373
00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:47.680
two weeks being taken as
gospel. And then, you know,

374
00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:50.350
when two weeks passes and
the thing isn't done, someone

375
00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:52.960
gets yelled at because they
made an offhand comment and

376
00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:55.060
that's more of a critique
of corporate culture than our

377
00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:57.850
product. But you know, the
tour intertwined, of course, and

378
00:20:57.850 --> 00:21:01.510
that's actually really common corporate
culture and where those products

379
00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:05.350
are used are often intertwined
and social culture. And the

380
00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:09.160
context where people use consumer
products are often intertwined and

381
00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:12.760
those things don't make it
into customer feedback and they

382
00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:16.330
don't make it into usability
tests often as well because

383
00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:19.780
people are trained to think
that usability testing is about

384
00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:22.690
the product and how well
I can use it. But

385
00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:26.050
if the problem is that
this product is not what

386
00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:27.760
all the cool kids are
using, you know, to go

387
00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:32.140
to the Snapchat example, then
you're not going to hear

388
00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:34.570
an email saying, I didn't
use this because my friends

389
00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:38.830
aren't using it, but you
would in a conversation, here's

390
00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:41.230
something like I have to
get an iPhone because all

391
00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:43.180
of my friends are on
iMessage. And if I'm not

392
00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:46.090
there, I won't get invited
to parties. That might be

393
00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:49.900
a really big factor in
your product development processes. Oh,

394
00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:53.290
people are making these decisions
based on their friends or

395
00:21:53.290 --> 00:21:56.200
their spouse or what their
manager thinks is a good

396
00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:59.880
use of their time. When
you, when people do these

397
00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:04.590
interviews, I assume that there
are behaviors that they could

398
00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:07.740
do that would invalidate the
interviews or kind of mess

399
00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:09.900
up the interviews. Like just
like interviewing people for a

400
00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:13.980
job is both an art
and a science and one

401
00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:16.800
could invalidate the interview. They
can screw it up and

402
00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:20.520
make and leave a person
unhappy. I assume that people

403
00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:23.670
could also do an interview
with a customer and do

404
00:22:23.670 --> 00:22:28.770
the product at disservice if
they exhibited certain behaviors during

405
00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:32.070
that interview, is that correct?
That is correct. And I

406
00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:35.250
think, you know, not to
pick on engineers, but I

407
00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:38.190
feel like this is a
thing that happens frequently is

408
00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:41.010
if your sense of the
world is to be a

409
00:22:41.010 --> 00:22:44.520
problem solver and to look
to, to make things right.

410
00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:49.080
Even with the best possible
intentions, you might try to

411
00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:52.170
talk people out of their
feelings or attempt to find

412
00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:56.490
a solution where someone was
not looking for it or,

413
00:22:56.490 --> 00:22:58.950
or try and basically defend
your product. You built it.

414
00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:02.220
And those are the only
times when I've really seen

415
00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:06.840
interviews go badly, is you're
talking to someone they're opening

416
00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:08.940
up to you. They're saying,
look, I just find this

417
00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:11.550
really hard to use because
I try and do this.

418
00:23:11.550 --> 00:23:14.700
And, and they get interrupted
with, wait, wait, wait. That's

419
00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:16.050
not how you're supposed to
use it. Let me show

420
00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:19.920
you how it should be
done. And that's, that's really

421
00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:25.170
all that makes us feel
pretty awful. And or someone

422
00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:27.090
might say, I really wish
your product did this. And

423
00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:28.770
someone says, Oh, but it
does. Didn't you look under

424
00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:35.610
this menu. Those things get
really bad. Or anytime someone

425
00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:39.570
talks about a feeling asking
why, which is a great

426
00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:44.010
question, but needs to be
softened. Just recently, I was

427
00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:48.530
sharing some feedback about teams
back with Microsoft teams back

428
00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:50.600
with the Amur team. And
I said that I did

429
00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:52.880
something that made me feel
stupid. And one of my,

430
00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:55.010
one of my ex coworkers
said, well, why did you

431
00:23:55.010 --> 00:23:58.760
feel stupid? And I immediately
felt more stupid. I didn't

432
00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:01.730
even really want to answer
him. And so you can

433
00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:06.260
get in these negative feedback
loops. So there's this kind

434
00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:08.720
of very much sense of,
of trying to be very

435
00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:12.950
Zen about taking it all
in, not arguing with anything,

436
00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:17.210
gently asking more questions. You
know, if that coworker had

437
00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:20.720
said, wow, that's really interesting.
I'm just curious, Cindy, are,

438
00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:22.700
can you tell me a
little bit more about why

439
00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:25.490
you felt that way? I
wouldn't have had that same

440
00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:29.780
immediate aversive reaction and it
can feel kind of fake

441
00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:33.350
sometimes, which is why I
often suggest that people who

442
00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:38.270
are trying to implement customer
interviewing start out as note

443
00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:41.750
takers and with someone like
a user researcher doing the

444
00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:44.630
interview, because those are people
who have been trained to

445
00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:48.130
take a very neutral tactic.
Yeah. This is something I

446
00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:53.140
think like one, one could
argue that an engineer or

447
00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:55.480
myself or whoever, I'll just
throw myself under the bus,

448
00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:58.360
you know, could, you know,
use that as an opportunity

449
00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:02.500
to try to validate themselves,
make themselves feel better, make

450
00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:04.600
them feel better about the
product that they just built.

451
00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:08.050
Well, they're hearing, you know,
possibly negative feedback. If someone

452
00:25:08.050 --> 00:25:11.050
wasn't successful using their product,
you know, that makes me

453
00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:14.320
the interviewer feel bad, but
it's not about me. Like

454
00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:17.500
this is an interview that
is literally in no way

455
00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:22.030
about me. So you're asking
for them to be empathetic.

456
00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:25.960
All you want is empathy.
Right? And I think a

457
00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:29.290
lot of times what's helpful
is to have a little

458
00:25:29.290 --> 00:25:32.620
bit of a training before
people jump into interviews where

459
00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:35.530
we basically reinforce that and
say, you know what? You're

460
00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:39.310
going to hear. Some people
complain about your product, which

461
00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:43.480
you are proud of. And
the point is that you

462
00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:45.820
want it to be better
than it is today. And

463
00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:49.270
by listening to these people
and understanding their behaviors and

464
00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:51.670
how they make decisions and
how they use our product,

465
00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:54.880
we can figure out how
to make it better. So

466
00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:58.180
it's, it's very much a
local Maxima problem. If we

467
00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:00.970
don't listen to customer interviews,
we feel like we're at

468
00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:04.570
the top of that peak.
But when we listen to

469
00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:06.910
them and we kind of
see what the actual opportunities

470
00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:09.730
are, we realize now this
is a local Maxima. It's

471
00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:11.350
going to get worse. We're
going to have to go

472
00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:14.140
through the period of hearing
how our baby is ugly,

473
00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:16.660
but then it's going to
get much better. And I

474
00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:20.140
find that even just reminding
people of that is a

475
00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:22.540
really helpful way of helping
them go through an interview

476
00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:26.170
and not feel terrible. Four,
if you don't mind for

477
00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:29.650
people who may not speak
English as a first language,

478
00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:32.800
or may not be familiar
with that term, could you

479
00:26:32.890 --> 00:26:36.100
just very briefly talk about
what local Maxima and local

480
00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:40.180
minima are in that context?
Sure. Ooh, let's see if

481
00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:42.730
I can actually explain it
in a mathematical way. Cause

482
00:26:42.730 --> 00:26:47.130
I probably, so there's a
sense of based on the

483
00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:51.120
information, you know, today, that's
how you're evaluating your success.

484
00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:54.960
And a local Maxima is
where as far as your

485
00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:58.140
information is telling you today,
you're doing, you're doing well.

486
00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:00.810
You're at the top of
your game. And you know,

487
00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:03.240
you can't see me do
the little hand motion, but

488
00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:06.420
you know, when, if you
see it graphed, you'll see

489
00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:09.450
there's like a peak and
then a Valley and then

490
00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:13.140
a higher peak. And once
you broaden your perspective, you

491
00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:16.170
bring in more information. You
might notice that, Hey, you're

492
00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:18.480
on top of a Hill,
but you're actually right next

493
00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:21.270
to a mountain. And so,
but to get to the

494
00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:23.280
top of that mountain, you're
first going to have to

495
00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:26.340
descend the Hill and be
even lower. And you're going

496
00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:28.830
to feel like you're losing
ground there, right? Because you're

497
00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:31.020
at a higher altitude and
you came down and now

498
00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:33.480
you have a lot more
climbing to do, but most

499
00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:36.810
of us would rather scale
the big peak that's, you

500
00:27:36.810 --> 00:27:38.250
know, that's why we do
what we do is we

501
00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:40.650
build great things. And so
we have to have that,

502
00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:43.770
you know, short term, short
term blow and short term

503
00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:47.900
a drawback, Right? It's that,
that point of the limit

504
00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:50.540
of the current design. But
if you make a big

505
00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:54.500
change, you could potentially reach
a much higher Maxima and

506
00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:58.670
mathematically an extreme. Yes. All
right. Cool. I appreciate that.

507
00:27:59.450 --> 00:28:04.430
So in the, in the
book you cover all of

508
00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:06.650
this stuff that we've talked
about, you talked about validating

509
00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:10.100
and invalidating the hypothesis. You,
you actually go through play

510
00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:13.520
by play, how to do
the customer interviews. So detailed

511
00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:16.910
kind of like pragmatic advice
on what people can do.

512
00:28:18.290 --> 00:28:20.300
It's only a couple of
years old, but I'm just

513
00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:23.570
curious. Is there anything that
you would add in the,

514
00:28:23.570 --> 00:28:25.910
in the three years since
the book came out or

515
00:28:25.910 --> 00:28:28.880
any, any lessons that has
invalidated any aspect of the

516
00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:33.020
book in your mind? There
is nothing that I would

517
00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:37.340
say has been invalidated, but
there's probably another chapter that

518
00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:40.880
could be added, which is
essentially the why you tried

519
00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:43.190
this and it didn't work.
And I have actually given

520
00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:46.400
that as a workshop a
few times, and you know,

521
00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:51.080
to summarize briefly it's, if
you try this in a

522
00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:56.180
place that is not willing
to accept the changes, it's

523
00:28:56.180 --> 00:29:00.980
not entirely worth the effort.
So to practice lean in

524
00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:05.900
general means letting go of
prod, you know, strict project

525
00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:08.810
plans and deadlines and scope,
which were always kind of

526
00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:10.880
a myth, but, but we
held to them, right? We

527
00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:12.800
said, you know, we're going
to build these things in

528
00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:15.380
this amount of time, we've
gotten burned down charts. We've

529
00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:18.290
got estimates of how long
each thing will take. If

530
00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:22.280
you are approaching a hypothesis
with the intent to prove

531
00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:25.340
it wrong, you can't do
that because you might find

532
00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:28.280
out in week one that
we were wrong about this.

533
00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:31.310
We shouldn't build this feature
so we should build this

534
00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:33.890
other thing instead. And that
thing will take longer. Or

535
00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:36.860
the reverse occasionally say we
can cut scope, but you

536
00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:40.370
know, obviously that happens less
often. So if you're in

537
00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:44.590
an organization that's not willing
to give up the security

538
00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:47.200
of those deadlines and that
knowledge that we've got a

539
00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:49.510
marketing launch, we're going to
announce these features in three

540
00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:52.690
months, you know, come hell
or high water. If your

541
00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:55.660
org not going to give
any on that, then you

542
00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:58.510
there's no sense doing this
because you will get interviews

543
00:29:58.510 --> 00:30:01.090
and nothing will change. So
I would say, save your

544
00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:05.740
breath in that case. The
other thing is that even

545
00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:08.770
in an org, that's willing
to accept that chaos. What

546
00:30:08.770 --> 00:30:13.270
I found happened with customer
development, with lean in general,

547
00:30:13.450 --> 00:30:15.760
and I'm sure people have
seen with agile as well,

548
00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:19.600
and pretty much any new
approach that's been tried is

549
00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:22.810
that if you're evangelizing something,
you talk about the good

550
00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:24.820
and you talk about what
we're going to get out

551
00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:26.740
of this. And you do
a little bit of a

552
00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:29.410
silver bullet. Everything will be
better once we do this,

553
00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:33.310
which is never true to
start with, but it means

554
00:30:33.310 --> 00:30:37.270
that even inadvertently people tend
to sweep objections under the

555
00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:41.140
rug. So if I talk
about doing interviews and someone

556
00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:43.540
on my team says, is
this really going to work?

557
00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:47.230
The worst thing I could
do is start talking about,

558
00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:49.330
of course, this is great.
This is all everything we're

559
00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:52.090
going to learn. How could
you even ask that? Because

560
00:30:52.090 --> 00:30:54.640
that's not going to convince
that skeptic. It's just going

561
00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:56.950
to tell that person, okay,
I'm not going to be

562
00:30:56.950 --> 00:30:59.830
honest around her anymore. I'm
just going to quietly grumble

563
00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:02.680
and not really get with
the program. And maybe that

564
00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:05.290
person will even undermine these
efforts because you know, they

565
00:31:05.290 --> 00:31:09.070
weren't really listened to. And
so when teams start with

566
00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:12.160
us, I always say, we
should start with where everyone

567
00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:15.280
talks about why they think
this won't work, everyone getting

568
00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:18.130
out on the table. You
know, it doesn't actually become

569
00:31:18.130 --> 00:31:21.550
a negativity session because the
next thing you do is

570
00:31:21.550 --> 00:31:24.910
say, okay, great, Scott, you're
telling me that this isn't

571
00:31:24.910 --> 00:31:28.420
gonna work for this reason.
How could we prevent that

572
00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:31.540
from happening? And a lot
of times people are able

573
00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:34.120
to come up with that
on that solution, but they

574
00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:36.640
haven't been given that kind
of olive branch to say,

575
00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:39.760
you're right. There is a
concern here. We should address

576
00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:42.400
it. And when you do
that and prepare the team,

577
00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:44.170
we're going to do these
interviews. What do you see

578
00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:47.470
as the risks? People will
say, what if you talk

579
00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:49.840
to the wrong kind of
customer, okay, we're going to

580
00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:53.140
address that by being very
clear about what customer segment

581
00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:56.350
we're talking to. And then
if they're not promising, we'll

582
00:31:56.440 --> 00:32:00.010
switch to another customer segment.
People say, we're going to

583
00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:02.770
do this. And you know,
and the big boss is

584
00:32:02.770 --> 00:32:04.390
just going to come in
and disagree at the last

585
00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:06.910
minute. Well, let's find out
what is the big bosses,

586
00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:10.870
appetite for change. So listening
to all of those objections

587
00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:13.690
and kind of preemptive preempting
them, but not in a,

588
00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:15.700
you know, be quiet kind
of way. But I tell

589
00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:18.670
me more and then let's
fix it. Those are really

590
00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:22.690
critical. If you've laid that
groundwork, then everything in the

591
00:32:22.690 --> 00:32:26.350
book works reasonably well, if
you haven't, you're in for

592
00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:28.390
a lot of frustration. So
I feel like if I

593
00:32:28.390 --> 00:32:30.670
do a second version or
an agenda, it would be

594
00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:33.370
to add that chapter about
getting yourself set up for

595
00:32:33.370 --> 00:32:36.900
success. That was in those
Very cool. Well, folks can

596
00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:42.320
visit you@cindyalvarez.com. They can learn
about your workshops. They can

597
00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:44.540
read all of your past
blog posts and get a

598
00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:48.020
link right there to pick
up the book, lean customer

599
00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:51.200
development. Thanks so much for
chatting with me today. Thank

600
00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:54.830
you. This has been another
episode of Hanselminutes and we'll

601
00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:55.970
see you again next week.
