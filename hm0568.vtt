empires about bringing back the
game age of empires with

12
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:12.260
new expansion packs after 16
years. Hi, this is Scott

13
00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.230
Hanselman. This is another episode
of Hansel minutes today. I'm

14
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.620
talking with Bert Beekman from
forgotten empires. How are you?

15
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.070
Very good. Thank you. I
am very happy to be

16
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.700
chatting with you because I
was on the internet a

17
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.140
while back as, as one
does. And in my surfing,

18
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.840
I noticed that there was
a new game out age

19
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:39.410
of empires to HD the
African kingdoms. And I had

20
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.270
to pause, I had to
pause a minute and I

21
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.200
had to ask myself what
decade we were in, what

22
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.640
is going on? It's 2017.
Yeah, it has been quite

23
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.730
crazy in Asia and Barstool.
And for the last three

24
00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.120
years, pretty much, we've seen
three expansions coming out and

25
00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.230
every time we get loads
of emails saying like, what,

26
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.040
what year is it? What
what's going on? Why are

27
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.280
still happening? Why is it
still a thing? And, yeah,

28
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.500
it's quite a long story.
Really when we started, I

29
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.790
think three or four years
ago by now we were

30
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:23.210
working on a phrase. So
after the game had been

31
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:28.880
out for 15, 13, something
like that here ages and

32
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.970
nobody at that point had
figured out how to add

33
00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.040
new civilizations to the game.
And I don't know, some,

34
00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.950
some lazy Sunday afternoon, I
was looking around the forums.

35
00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.610
I was super curious, like,
has anyone ever managed to

36
00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.540
have, you know, civilizations to
agent on Barstool? And I

37
00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.110
figured it out, there was
a guy in China and

38
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.270
he was talking on some
kind of forum. And he

39
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.240
said, like, I managed to
add a 19 or 18

40
00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:02.080
in the game at the
civilization to Adrian press. And

41
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.350
that's kind kinda what I
saw. So like 19 SIF

42
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.040
and then a whole bunch
of Chinese science. I don't

43
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.100
speak Chinese at all. So
that was quite challenging. And

44
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.100
I started digging and with
Google translate and then all

45
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.830
the tools he was using,
I was like, okay, we

46
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.490
can do this. We can
add a new sift in

47
00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:25.510
the game. And at that
point we start getting more

48
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.950
people on boards, like people
who could do graphics, people

49
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.610
could make some sounds, maybe
even compose a bit of

50
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.720
music. And I think after
a year that all added

51
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:43.960
up and accumulated to one
big project and that's at

52
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.300
the same, the very same
time, which we were very

53
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.880
well aware of Microsoft. So
I regained interest in nature.

54
00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.260
And so what they did,
they were working on the

55
00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.450
HD edition, which is on
esteem and at the very

56
00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.660
same moment where we're working
on lot. And so that

57
00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.990
kind of came together in
a way like when horrible,

58
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:07.840
it was released, I think
a month later or something

59
00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:11.830
the HD edition was announced.
And we were like, T

60
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.240
is that, that's an opportunity
there. Like, we have a

61
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:20.350
lot of new content here.
They have regained interest in

62
00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.990
the game. We should figure
out how to work together.

63
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.710
I have to say that
was a long and almost

64
00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.070
painful process to get in
touch with Microsoft because you're

65
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.670
just the guy behind the
computer, right? Hands Microsoft is

66
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.190
this big company. And you're
like, how do I talk

67
00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.150
to Microsoft? I know that
bill Gates is at Microsoft,

68
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.430
but you don't send a
mail to say, Hey, bill,

69
00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.160
we want to do something
with Microsoft. There is no

70
00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.230
contact point for us that
was so difficult to get

71
00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:50.140
into. But after a while
we got in touch with

72
00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:54.070
the right people and yeah,
it starts from there. And

73
00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.520
he made one expansion that
turns into two expansions. And

74
00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.230
then I think last December
we had third expansion horizons,

75
00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.780
righteous being released. And then
that's the one that's caught

76
00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.260
your eye. And then probably
surprised you're like, why is

77
00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.820
this still a thing? Yeah,
the, they actually, the African

78
00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.280
kingdoms was the one that
caught me first, but you've

79
00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.880
got the forgotten, you've got
the African kingdoms. And then

80
00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.520
now you've got rise of
the, of the Rodriguez. So

81
00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.870
yes, three, three complete and
massive expansions in a short

82
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.820
period of time, encompassing all
kinds of cultures that we

83
00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.360
know. And, and frankly cultures
we didn't see before and

84
00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:39.630
a fairly Eurocentric age of
empires. I I'm, I want

85
00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.190
to back up though, cause
you've touched on so many

86
00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.270
different things. Microsoft is a
hundred. No, it's great. I

87
00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.450
guess there's a 120 830,000
people on a, your point

88
00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:51.660
about trying to find the
right person. I've I find

89
00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:56.610
that there's one person inside
of Microsoft that is super

90
00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.350
interested. Whatever you have to
say, you just have to

91
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:04.880
find that one person and
everyone else has zero interest

92
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.080
in what you have to
say. Let's do it. There's

93
00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.570
no middle ground. You know
what I mean? And as

94
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:11.060
you find that to be
The case as well, we

95
00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:16.090
definitely, definitely you jump through
so many hoops at first.

96
00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.070
You're like, Oh yeah, just
talk to that guy, jump,

97
00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:20.770
talk to that guy, jump,
talk to that guy. And

98
00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:24.340
you jumped around and eventually
you get that guy. If

99
00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.620
you're lucky, we were super
lucky because they were on

100
00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.420
that project. And we had
a queue to begin with.

101
00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:34.360
We got in touch with
an altar developer of the

102
00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.360
original game and he told
us like that that might

103
00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:40.330
be a guy if he's
still around there to, to

104
00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:44.290
kind of start jumping around.
But indeed it's, it's, it's

105
00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:51.850
super difficult to find them
The, the mods are these

106
00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:55.630
hacks or is this like,
are you like, you know,

107
00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:58.180
cause there are mods that
are hacks. Like we like

108
00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:01.150
there's there's mods for doom
where they just swap out

109
00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:04.540
textures. Or did you find
a way to add this

110
00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:08.860
in like the way they
would, It was a mix.

111
00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:12.280
It wasn't mixed there. The
word like this, this was

112
00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:16.870
actually quite an interesting point
about the whole timing. Like

113
00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:20.200
we mentioned before, it's been
16 years since something 15

114
00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.170
years and something happens in
the series. A so a

115
00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:25.960
lot of the people who
grew up initially with age

116
00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:30.250
of empires two, they didn't
know there were 10 years

117
00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:33.370
old at the time. Now
they're 20, 26, something like

118
00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:36.190
that. They just came out
of college or a university.

119
00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.720
They have a lot of
time on their hands in,

120
00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.380
in some cases or they
need to find a new

121
00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:43.960
hobby, a new passion. And
a lot of people just

122
00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.090
went back to age, vampire
parts, like a childhood game

123
00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:51.700
and it's kind of debt
environment. That's I met a

124
00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:54.760
lot of people and they,
they suddenly had the skills

125
00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:58.660
to make tools, to edit
the cake, to, to even

126
00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:02.950
hack the game and all
those tools and those hacking

127
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:07.810
skills combined kind of made
the motto. So it's, it's

128
00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:11.650
a mix off of hacking
and, and, and, and proper

129
00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:14.830
tools in the way that's
ensemble studios. Did it back

130
00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:19.930
in the nineties. What is
it about age of empires

131
00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:24.370
too? That gets people so
nostalgic. I mean, three came

132
00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:27.850
out, you know, maybe 10
years ago and it was

133
00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:31.870
more 3d and more fancy,
but people kind of shrugged,

134
00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:34.300
I feel the same way
about like Diablo two, there's

135
00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:39.010
something about these bitmap based
high Rez, you know, raster

136
00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:43.480
based games that make people
happy. Yeah. I, one of

137
00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:47.620
the things that, that's definitely
a thing is that age

138
00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:52.180
of empires too, was one
of the last I can

139
00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:55.740
massive games in the, to
the environment. And after that,

140
00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:58.760
it went really quick into
treaty. Like, as you mentioned,

141
00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:03.810
<inaudible> street, there were full
blown treaty games, but especially

142
00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:06.000
a different told you was
in treaty. It was in

143
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.180
its infancy at that time.
And if you play it

144
00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:11.670
nowadays, you think like, Oh,
it's still a good game,

145
00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:14.310
but the graphics they look
like, I mean, the lek

146
00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:19.140
is just two polygons, that's
it? While in each vampires

147
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:23.100
too. If, if, if we
look at the polygon counts

148
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:27.180
of a unit, that's a
few millions per unit, which

149
00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:30.240
you can never achieve in
a treaty game, indeed it's

150
00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.550
then render it out into
a Sprite, which is a

151
00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:37.650
very, very simplified, but the
quality is just so enormously

152
00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:41.490
detailed. And that's the level
of detail that tree D

153
00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:45.670
has. Well, it has called
up by now, but it

154
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:48.270
took a while to get
there. So I think just

155
00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:51.480
that fact that it's so,
so such a high quality

156
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:56.490
to T game helps in,
in, in making it H

157
00:09:56.490 --> 00:10:00.140
well, I can say it
like that. It seem a

158
00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:03.440
little bit like in the
early two thousands, mid two

159
00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:07.310
thousands, people were trying to
make three D games just

160
00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:09.680
because they were 3d, just
like when we saw three

161
00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:14.030
D movies and people forgot
that we were at the

162
00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:17.120
peak of the two D
game. At that point, there

163
00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:20.840
was no reason to necessarily
switch to 3d, but they

164
00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:24.110
did it just because they
could, I think so. Yes.

165
00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:26.930
And I mean, it, wasn't
new technology. And by now,

166
00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:29.570
so many games are introduced
and we really have that,

167
00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:33.430
that level where you can
really wow people by, by

168
00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.290
just more than the fact
that these three D really

169
00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:41.100
looks impressive, but indeed back
in the days, yeah, it's,

170
00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:44.870
it's, it's just the different,
the capabilities that you can

171
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:49.550
do, which really into it.
So You started out, you're

172
00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:52.190
a mod, you're a mod
collective, you're a bunch of

173
00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:56.480
fans that like to mod
someone, figures out how to

174
00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.310
break into this, you know,
in a, in a kind

175
00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:01.130
of a mod kind of
way. Does this mean that

176
00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:04.160
you install age of empires
two and then you unzip

177
00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.050
a bunch of resources on
top of it? Or does

178
00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:11.120
this mean that you're actually
changing binaries Code? We did

179
00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:14.510
change some binary's in the
coats, but we try to

180
00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:16.640
make sure, I mean, at
that point we had no

181
00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.070
idea about the legalities of
all the things we were

182
00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:24.710
doing molding. Yeah. It's a
super great legal area. Right?

183
00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:29.750
So we, we did change
the binaries, but indeed you

184
00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:32.750
had to have the old
game installed and then we

185
00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:35.240
provided an installer as well.
And then you could just

186
00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:39.530
kind of add it to
your old game. That's the

187
00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:44.170
way it worked. And is
this something you're doing in,

188
00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:47.180
in the existing tools? Is
it a collection of tools?

189
00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:49.430
Are you in paintbrush and
visual studio, or what are

190
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:54.340
you building these things in
The, the hacking thing itself

191
00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:59.590
was all in the, with
the hex editor. That was

192
00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:04.390
it, there was this it's,
I can't say enough. There

193
00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:07.210
was one guy who went
in with the hex editor

194
00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:10.090
and he did create his
stuff, like adding a resolution

195
00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:14.260
options, like a HD white
screen. You can even play

196
00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.350
it in Fourcade that kind
of stuff. Just with the

197
00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:22.150
hex editor, improving the AI,
like it's, it's now at

198
00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:24.130
least 10 times smarter. And
he did that with the

199
00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:29.230
hex editor. And that guy
is just ridiculously talented and

200
00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.720
smart. And I jumped into
the exit to throw myself

201
00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:33.730
a few times and I
managed to do I'm gonna

202
00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:37.060
change the variable and stuff
like that. But I think

203
00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:42.490
new functionality that's I still
don't find Fatima how managed

204
00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:45.810
to do that. That was
incredible. That changed at all.

205
00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:47.850
When you finally got Microsoft
on the phone, did they

206
00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:49.740
say, Oh, well, here you
go. Here's the code? Or

207
00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:52.410
are you still doing it
that way? Oh no. That's

208
00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:55.890
that's that's all in the
past taste. You have to

209
00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:58.290
be worried there. Oh, no,
no, no. That's that is

210
00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:03.150
long gone. Luckily, no, nowadays
the expansions we have the

211
00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:06.750
source code to work with,
and that is a relief.

212
00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:09.420
I mean, the source code,
of course it is. It

213
00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:12.960
is old. It's from 20
years ago, coding practices have

214
00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:18.210
changed quite a bit Lucas.
Oh yes. So when we

215
00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:21.150
first saw some of the
things that were made, we

216
00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:24.150
were like, how, how does
this even work? How you

217
00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:27.600
go around this. But we
were supported at the time

218
00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:31.800
and still are by an
older studio who are helping

219
00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:34.410
us with the coding. Because
I mean, at the time

220
00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:39.030
Microsoft kind of was greeted
by this group of fence

221
00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:43.770
mothers. And we have no
proven or proven experience with

222
00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:48.060
goats. We just had experience
with design and content, and

223
00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:51.030
indeed a bit of Faqih
tacky in the binary files,

224
00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:56.220
but proper coding. So they
gave us a studio to

225
00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:59.730
support that, You know, but
I think that as, as

226
00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:02.040
I think it was Jeff
Atwood who said that, that

227
00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:05.430
one lacks in, in talent,
they make up for, with

228
00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:09.060
enthusiasm. It sounds like you
put together a group that

229
00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:12.000
is just so enthusiastic about
this game. That the little

230
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.460
details, like the code don't,
don't really matter at that

231
00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:18.770
point. Ah, you, you make
a good point there. The

232
00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:22.050
passion is a bit ridiculous
at some time. I mean,

233
00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:26.820
I like it myself. I'm
the, okay. Just, just a

234
00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:30.720
stupid story. Like the way
I got into whole this

235
00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:33.600
age vampire stuff is because
when I was a kid,

236
00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:38.340
I was like, I had
like my little scrap book

237
00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:40.860
and I was writing out
sifts that I wanted to

238
00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:43.830
add to the game. And
I dunno know, a few

239
00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:45.810
years later I was like,
I want to make eight

240
00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:47.940
pound price myself. I want
to make my own age

241
00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:50.670
pen prize game because I
couldn't figure out how to

242
00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:53.720
add to the existing. I
mean, I was 12 years

243
00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.790
old back then. So how
the hell would I know?

244
00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:59.840
So I started to learn
about coding and then eventually

245
00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:05.030
I started to study computer
science, yada yada, yada, and

246
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:07.970
then eventually by, I have
to say a lot of

247
00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:11.600
luck. I ended up working
on H vampires, but it

248
00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:14.930
goes for pretty much everybody
in the team. They were

249
00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:19.430
so I don't know, swallowed
up by the whole game

250
00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:24.290
and they're still so passionate
about it. And indeed it's

251
00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:28.310
like, we don't come to
work and work on age

252
00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:32.420
of empires. We, if it's
the weekend and we want

253
00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:34.640
to make scenario, we make
the scenario and we have

254
00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:40.250
fun making the scenario and
eventually it sold. So it's

255
00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:42.470
the, the passion thing is
definitely there, but I also

256
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:45.110
totally understand Microsoft that they
were like, yeah, but we

257
00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:49.340
need some kind of industry
experience in there too, to

258
00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:52.010
kind of even give you
some price point for it.

259
00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:54.490
Like they could have just
said, no, they could have

260
00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:56.260
not taken your call. And
that would have been, you

261
00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.060
just would have been monitors,
but now this is a

262
00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:00.370
real company. Like this is
for sale. You can go

263
00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:03.340
on steam and it's great.
And I'm running it on

264
00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:06.940
windows 10 and I had
no issues at all. Yeah,

265
00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.600
pretty much. That's that's, that's
how it works now. Actually,

266
00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:13.300
it was one of the
first things we had to

267
00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:15.460
like the first hoop we
had to jump through. When

268
00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:19.240
we got in touch with
Microsoft, they were like, yeah,

269
00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:21.130
you need to set up
a company. If you will,

270
00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:23.680
to work with us, we
don't work with individuals in

271
00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:28.510
this kind of a way.
We're like, okay, how do

272
00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:31.390
I set up a company
at that time? I was

273
00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:35.830
still working in the restaurant
or something. So it's, it's,

274
00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:40.690
it's a big jumble on
the seventh. So the game

275
00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:43.570
that got me, the expansion
that I started with that

276
00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:47.050
got me interested in giving
you a call was the,

277
00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:52.780
the African kingdoms. This was
the second new expansion in

278
00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:55.930
age of empires, two in
16 years, it included the

279
00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:59.680
Berbers, the Molly ans the
Ethiopians or Habesha and the

280
00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:03.940
Portuguese. How do you pick,
I mean, Africa's thousands of

281
00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:07.660
tribes, dozens of recognizable tribes.
How do you decide which

282
00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:10.240
of the four for a
game to include as a

283
00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:16.390
civilization? Very good question. Actually,
that's, that's something I've argued

284
00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:20.890
or no targets discussed with
the team for our student

285
00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:25.120
hints. And we still don't
really know what we don't

286
00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:27.940
have a proper process for
that we usually start with.

287
00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:34.120
Okay. What is something really
interesting about something that happened

288
00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:38.110
in that region in that
time? I'll take one example.

289
00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:43.630
The Maldivians they had a
King Mansa, Musa. He was

290
00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:46.900
the richest guy that ever
lived. He was, I don't

291
00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:49.350
know, it's not two words,
but it's like take bill

292
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:51.570
Gates and do that times
of hundreds. And you have

293
00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:54.750
to work months and Moosa
owns back in the days.

294
00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:58.830
And there were like stories
about him going on, trading

295
00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:02.580
trips through the Sahara, and
then all the regions he

296
00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:07.040
posts true. He had no
idea, no concept of, of

297
00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:10.140
straight and money. He just
had so much money. So

298
00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:11.760
he went to a little
village and he was like,

299
00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:15.270
I want some milk. And
he gave the guy a

300
00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:18.360
boar of gold. And then
all the sudden that guy

301
00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:21.810
was the richest guy in
the whole tribe. And all

302
00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:26.310
those things after that whole
trip he did from Mali

303
00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:31.320
to Cairo. The whole economy
of North Africa was pretty

304
00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:34.230
much collapsed because that guy
just spent his money like

305
00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:38.430
crazy. And those are the
little things that, that make

306
00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:42.030
you interested. Like, Oh wait,
what did I do? And

307
00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:44.610
how did he get so
rich? And what's happened there.

308
00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:47.010
And then you start thinking,
you got the great, great

309
00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:49.860
storyline. And then you're like,
yeah, we have to make

310
00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:52.980
a civilization around this. And
they start thinking like, did

311
00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:58.920
they have military and battles
that they fought? And yeah,

312
00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:02.780
that, that's kind of how
it starts. So when you,

313
00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:05.150
in the traditionally in age
of empires, when you make

314
00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:09.530
a civilization, then there's a
hero or a, like the

315
00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:12.950
boss of that civilization that
you pick and you could

316
00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:15.920
pick a lot of different
ones. We were spending a

317
00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:18.920
lot of times we did
you work with people who

318
00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:21.620
are, has to have historical
context in that civilization. Like,

319
00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:26.840
for example, with the, with
the Ethiopian expansion, you had

320
00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:33.410
Yoda or Judith, who's a
betta Israel queen who basically

321
00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:36.560
like laid waste to them
and the accent might empire.

322
00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:38.360
Like how did you explore
that? And how did you

323
00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:40.400
make sure that it was
something that you would want

324
00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:43.700
to talk about? And maybe
you wouldn't offend modern day.

325
00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:47.150
If you, if you decided
to pick that as a

326
00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:50.720
hero, That's a very good
question. Actually, we had this

327
00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:53.960
happen once in the past,
we were working with Indians

328
00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:59.150
in the forgotten expansion. And
to be, we're talking about

329
00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:01.970
a hero, I can't remember
his name anymore, but we

330
00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:05.360
were developing a storyline. He
was going to be the

331
00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.850
great Indian hero. Yeah. They
are the other, at that

332
00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:11.120
point, we also had an
Indian team. It was working

333
00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:14.510
on something unrelated and he,
he saw what we were

334
00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:17.510
doing on the Indian storyline.
And he was like, stop,

335
00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:21.170
don't do that. This is
like making a German campaign

336
00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:26.840
and glorifying Hitler. You don't
do this. I can't remember

337
00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:30.680
what the guy was. We
were very happy that we

338
00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:32.900
had the Indian guy on
the team back in the

339
00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:36.980
day. So, so that's, that's
scales only because you had

340
00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:39.170
a diverse team. Like we
always talk about how diverse

341
00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:42.740
teams, you know, help because
someone can go and say,

342
00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:46.400
Oh, yikes. You know, let's
not do that. But that

343
00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:49.120
only, if you hadn't had
that Indian gentleman on your

344
00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:52.570
team, you would have been
in trouble. How do you

345
00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:55.150
do that now? Do you
take the storylines to colleges

346
00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:58.120
or universities and confirm that
this is a good idea.

347
00:20:58.770 --> 00:21:02.340
Nowadays, we luckily have Microsoft
to fall back on that

348
00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:06.210
we always make restore Alliance.
We did some research ourselves,

349
00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:10.950
but then the effort geo
poll departments to make sure

350
00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:15.540
that there's nothing touchy or
icky in storylines at all.

351
00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:19.070
And they, they go quite
in depth on that. I

352
00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:22.290
don't dunno. We, we, we
touched on something about China

353
00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:25.620
and they're like, Oh, China
making, make sure that's things

354
00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:29.100
with Tibet, China, Taiwan that
you kind of stay away

355
00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:33.990
from the border regions that
are at the moment, a

356
00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:38.640
bit sensitive, stuff like that.
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Well, I

357
00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:41.400
can definitely say like, as
a fan of history, like

358
00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:44.670
you've done a lot of
really great historical work and

359
00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:47.070
you, and one could not
only play the game for

360
00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:49.890
hours, but then go about,
go and read about, you

361
00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:53.850
know, the warrior Queens and
Kings for, for hours. I'm

362
00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:58.080
a bit of a historian
around Ethiopian exabyte history and

363
00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:02.580
the whole queen queen Yoda
queen COVID 10th, 10th century

364
00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:06.360
Ady is fascinating. And of
course on the Indian side,

365
00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:10.320
you ended up picking Perth
Faraj. Chohun from, you know,

366
00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:13.320
folk legends in Gujarat, around
the 12th century. You could

367
00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:15.210
read about these and go
on forever. So it was

368
00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:17.580
really, it's cool to play
a great game, but also

369
00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:19.380
to see that you put
a lot of work into

370
00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:22.380
it and you thought about
it, it just makes it,

371
00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:24.210
I don't know, somehow it
makes it more fun. You

372
00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:26.460
know, you could have just
made something up, but you

373
00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:29.820
didn't Indeed it's there, there
was one campaign actually, where

374
00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:33.690
we went a bit more
freestyle, but yeah, there was,

375
00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:38.310
it was the storyline in
the forgotten about the quest

376
00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:43.620
for El Dorado. Yeah. Yeah.
Francisco the Alameda. Yes, indeed.

377
00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:48.510
No, sorry. No, Francisco. Amanda
is the Portuguese Explorer. You

378
00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:52.680
went out the other side
of the globe, the Eldorado,

379
00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:56.550
what's more an exhibition to
the Amazon where the Spanish

380
00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:59.340
were kind of looking for
elders, the city of gold.

381
00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:04.950
And indeed there is not
that much information about that

382
00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:11.400
expedition mainly because they all
died in the end. Sorry

383
00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:15.870
for the spoilers there, but
sorry, I should have said

384
00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:21.840
it before. Sorry. No, anyway,
it's a, I think it's

385
00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:23.970
a 10,000. It's a thousand
year old spoiler. So it's

386
00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:27.540
okay. Pretty much, pretty much.
We're talking about History here.

387
00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:30.510
So we kind of went
a bit more freestyle there,

388
00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:34.790
but indeed generally the campaign
team ever since then, we

389
00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:39.030
really focused on long historical
and then trying to stick

390
00:23:39.030 --> 00:23:41.580
to the history as much
as possible. And that's also

391
00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:45.890
something that I really noticed
too in play the original

392
00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:49.400
campaigns. There was a campaign
in Joan of arc and

393
00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:54.020
you have to, I don't
know, defense Paris or liberate

394
00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:59.380
Paris. I don't remember exactly
what it was. And in,

395
00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:03.770
in history it looks like
they set that they walked

396
00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:07.820
around Paris and then they
conquered in nearby castle and

397
00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:10.880
indeed in the scenario, the
best way to win that

398
00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:14.390
scenario is go around Paris,
take a nearby console and

399
00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:17.810
then continue along your Merry
way. And that was so

400
00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:22.730
nice to discover afterwards, like,
Hey, this is quite well

401
00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:27.280
research. Yeah. It's also nice
that while you could make

402
00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:28.750
stuff up and like you
said, you did in a

403
00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:33.460
couple of instances, history is
sometimes crazy enough that even

404
00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:34.900
the, you know, the stories
that you can just pluck

405
00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:37.150
out of history are almost
good enough for your storyline.

406
00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:41.350
Absolutely. Absolutely. And that's kind
of the basis of age

407
00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:44.320
of empires. It's a game
it's only a history book,

408
00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:48.910
but it's a game mainly
inspired by history. So yeah,

409
00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:54.610
99% of the campaigns are
his historical tales. That's kind

410
00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:56.530
of molded into the game,
but in the end it's

411
00:24:56.530 --> 00:25:00.520
still the history behind. And
interestingly, I've got a nine

412
00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:03.070
year old and an 11
year old and they both

413
00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:06.310
love playing this game and
they will play the game.

414
00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:08.710
Then they want to run
off and read the book.

415
00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:12.160
I know it sounds cliche,
but that's exactly what happens.

416
00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:14.020
They want to learn, you
know, the Mayas and the

417
00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:15.640
Aztecs fight and they go,
Oh, that's fine. That all

418
00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:20.320
about them, you know, or,
or whatever That, that is

419
00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:22.930
fairly nice. I have to
say, that's glad to hear

420
00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:26.410
that the game is still
being played by well, a

421
00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:29.620
completely new generation pretty much.
Yeah, It really is. And

422
00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:32.980
interestingly, they don't say a
word about 3d versus this

423
00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:35.290
or that. And the fact
that you can run it

424
00:25:35.290 --> 00:25:37.390
on a big screen, we're
running it on a 30

425
00:25:37.390 --> 00:25:41.620
inch monitor, you know, more
dots. That's all, they want

426
00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:43.480
more dots. So being able
to run it in four

427
00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:47.380
K is pretty amazing. Yeah.
Oh yeah, absolutely. It's a,

428
00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:51.040
it's, it's quite ridiculous. You
can, you can actually very

429
00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:54.430
nice thing about the HD
edition and I'm not just

430
00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:57.790
stupidly plugging it because we,
weren't only with Austin that

431
00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:01.520
if you played it back
in the day, it wasn't

432
00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:04.330
an 800 by 600 pixels
and you could see your

433
00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:08.110
thousands. And then if you
were lucky to villagers and

434
00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:10.570
now you can see off
your empire. And if you're

435
00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:12.520
lucky on the fourth game
on Lake, or you can

436
00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:16.090
see neighbors as well. It's
ridiculous. That actually brings up

437
00:26:16.090 --> 00:26:19.570
an interesting question from a
processing power perspective, given that

438
00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:24.040
there is probably two orders
of magnitude, maybe three more

439
00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:27.880
processing power, you know, here
you've, you've described a scenario

440
00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:32.230
where you've got four, eight,
12 times more stuff going

441
00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:35.230
on on screen. I assume
that there's more than enough

442
00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:38.050
CPU overhead to be doing
all of that kind of

443
00:26:38.050 --> 00:26:43.030
work. And the game runs,
you know, buttery smooth I

444
00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:46.110
to say that was a,
a long and difficult journey.

445
00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:51.630
Yes, that was ridiculous. The,
the one thing that was

446
00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:55.050
really good well done in
the very original game was

447
00:26:55.050 --> 00:26:57.690
the way that the sprites
and the terrain and everything

448
00:26:57.690 --> 00:27:01.050
was surrendered. It was very
meticulous. It was all done

449
00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:03.570
in assembly codes to make
sure there was absolutely no

450
00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:08.070
overhead at all. So every
pixel was only Truong. If

451
00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:11.880
it had to be drawn,
no overheads, no nothing. And

452
00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:15.840
if you scale it up
from the old, old resolution,

453
00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:20.520
800, 602 to four K,
that still works. And there

454
00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:24.420
was barely any overhead when
the HD edition came out.

455
00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:27.690
Some of those things were
swapped out and there were

456
00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:33.870
some serious performance sets that
was the specifically, the terrain

457
00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:37.590
was done differently. It was
changed from like a two

458
00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:41.160
D rendering system to a
tree. The mesh, I mean,

459
00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:44.490
it still looks like today,
but under the hood was

460
00:27:44.490 --> 00:27:47.600
a tree. Right, Right. In
order to make you have

461
00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:50.510
a texture with a mountains
over the top, Pretty much,

462
00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:53.660
pretty much. And it made
sense at the time to

463
00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:58.810
do that change, but it
kind of backfired. So thinking

464
00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:02.240
through that and optimizing it
to, to, to get to

465
00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:04.490
the level of the original
game that took awhile, but

466
00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:09.950
nowadays it's runs as smooth
as it should be. Nice.

467
00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:13.580
It seems that people respected
performance though, back in the

468
00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:16.610
early nineties. And now, you
know, it's pretty easy to

469
00:28:16.610 --> 00:28:18.530
be spoiled and just throw
a four loop into some

470
00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:20.540
code and not think about
the ramifications of it when

471
00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:24.860
you scale it up. Indeed,
indeed. It was actually ridiculous.

472
00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:29.060
When, when we did go
in with the profiler, it

473
00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:33.050
wasn't, it just a few
careless, four loops. That's where

474
00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:35.900
doing too much work. And
that was, it just took

475
00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:39.350
ages to find it. I
always joke about that. Like,

476
00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:41.330
you know, you're in an
application, I always think of

477
00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:43.850
it as Microsoft outlook, but
it doesn't really matter. I'm

478
00:28:43.850 --> 00:28:47.270
in an application and I'm
in somebody's for-loop and it's

479
00:28:47.270 --> 00:28:50.000
just like, where is that
person? Can I call them?

480
00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.500
Can I tell them I'm
stuck in there for a

481
00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:55.520
loop? I can feel it.
I know. So what's about

482
00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:58.100
the future of, of age
of empires. You've got a

483
00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:01.310
studio now you've released three
of them. People can buy

484
00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:04.790
them on steam. They should
go and buy them immediately

485
00:29:04.790 --> 00:29:08.810
after this show because they're
really very well priced value

486
00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:11.840
priced. It's not, not going
to break the bank. Are

487
00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:13.670
you going to keep doing
this until you get tired?

488
00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:20.150
I guess so. So I,
I do remember after the

489
00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:24.680
very first expansion came out,
which is by now three

490
00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:26.960
years ago, I was like,
yeah, this is it. There's

491
00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:29.600
no more room for civilizations
and age of empires to

492
00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:33.130
we've reached the limits. And
yeah, we're, we're too expensive

493
00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:36.170
as it had. So at
this point, I say, never

494
00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:40.220
say never, there was still
room for Mark expansions, if

495
00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:42.190
they're going to happen. I
don't know, but we'd love

496
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:45.550
to do them. And at
this point we're still actively

497
00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:48.820
supporting the game as well.
We have tournaments going on.

498
00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:51.430
So we are making sure
there are patches balance changes

499
00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:55.270
the things for the really
back fence to keep them

500
00:29:55.330 --> 00:29:59.050
around, to keep them entertained.
Nice. So work like work

501
00:29:59.050 --> 00:30:02.590
continues. Yes. We're definitely not
out of the game yet.

502
00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:08.450
This works on just I'm
saying this because it's true.

503
00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:10.770
I running this on my
surface. I've played it on

504
00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:13.980
airplanes. It runs on my
full desktop. It scales to

505
00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:18.990
darn near any resolution from,
you know, 1,024 up. So

506
00:30:19.290 --> 00:30:22.140
there's really no excuse. Even
a modest machine runs it

507
00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:24.150
very, very nicely. I've had
no issues. I use it

508
00:30:24.150 --> 00:30:28.440
all. Especially if he's play
like the normal games, like

509
00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:31.410
beat up an AI. Totally
fine. It should run on

510
00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:34.740
anything. The main specs that
are specified in store page

511
00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:39.450
are pretty much on point.
Very cool. Yep. And where

512
00:30:39.450 --> 00:30:42.720
can people find you and
your company and, and get

513
00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:47.430
involved and then do they
just Google it too? Yes,

514
00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:49.920
I think so. If you
go to our website, Goldman

515
00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:52.890
empire little nets, I think
on the front page, you

516
00:30:52.890 --> 00:30:55.110
can see all the expansions
with links to the steam

517
00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:58.560
store. So you can find
it there as well. Oh,

518
00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:01.920
that's forgotten empires.net. We'll put
it in the show notes

519
00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:04.470
and we'll tweet it. And
we'll spread the word about

520
00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:09.630
this, this, this passion that
you have built an entire

521
00:31:09.630 --> 00:31:12.470
studio around. And we're thrilled
that you've taken a, a

522
00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:16.110
game that hasn't seen an
expansion in 16 years and

523
00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:21.270
made multiple fantastic expansions. Thanks
for sticking with it. Thanks

524
00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:24.960
a lot for having us.
This has been another episode

525
00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:27.540
of Hansel minutes and I'll
see you again next week.
