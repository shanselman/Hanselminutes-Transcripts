Hanselman. This is another episode

11
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.930
of Hansel minutes, and I'm
sitting here at eight bar

12
00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.900
camp meetup in Portland, Oregon
with my buddy Aaron Hockley,

13
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.590
who is making that transition
from amateur photographer to professional

14
00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.020
photographer. Thanks for sitting down
with me. Yeah, thanks for

15
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.020
the opportunity. So, you know,
I had lunch a couple

16
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.960
of weeks ago because I
bought a Nikon D 40,

17
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.900
which was my first digital
SLR. This is my first,

18
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.230
you know, camera that when
I pushed the button, it

19
00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.660
actually takes the picture without
a pause. And this was

20
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.140
huge for me. And my
ability at photography goes about

21
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.460
is I can take a
picture and I can upload

22
00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.580
it to flicker. You gotta
start somewhere. And that's, you

23
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.580
know, with the DSLR, that's
one of the nice things

24
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.920
is that you have the
ability to go from a,

25
00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.840
you know, a fully automatic
mode where it does take

26
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.520
the picture right away, but
then you have the ability

27
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.250
to tweak a lot of
the settings. As you learn

28
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.100
more about, you know, the
different technical things that go

29
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.320
together to make a, a
good picture. So what is

30
00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.600
the difference between a DSLR
and just like, you know,

31
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.080
my little Canon point and
shoot that I had a

32
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.410
point and shoot camera, it
gets it to nickname, you

33
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.380
know, as a point shoot,
because essentially you have limited

34
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.560
options to control, you know,
the technical aspects of it

35
00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.410
that has a fixed lens.
There's a lens in the

36
00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.370
camera. You can't change the
lenses. Whereas a DSLR, you

37
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.460
have the ability to attach
a different lens, which is

38
00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.620
going to have any number
of different technical specs. As

39
00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.560
far as the, you know,
the focal length, you know,

40
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.630
whether it's a wide angle
lens or a zoom lands,

41
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.990
as well as the quality
of the glass, you can

42
00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.330
get really cheap lenses. You
can get lenses that cost

43
00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.420
you no more than your,
your car, as well as

44
00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.810
the ability to get a
lens that has a different,

45
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.890
a different range for the
F stop for the aperture,

46
00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.960
which controls some of the
aspects in the, in the

47
00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.000
picture. Okay. So we're going
to talk about f-stop and

48
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.370
aperture in a second, but
if I understand correctly, D

49
00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.550
is the fundamental thing that's
interesting about DSLR. The first

50
00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.170
thing that's going to really
strikes people is that when

51
00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.100
you look through the viewfinder,
you, in fact, looking through

52
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.050
The lens Yeah. With a
DSLR, you're looking at an

53
00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.340
actual, you're looking through the
viewfinder, which goes down to

54
00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.030
a mirror, which reflects what's
being seen out of the

55
00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.060
lens. And so, as opposed
to what they point and

56
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.380
shoot, where they will sometimes
have an optical viewfinder, but

57
00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.230
more than often, you're looking
at, you know, what the

58
00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.140
computer is interpreting as the
image that's hitting the sensor.

59
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.620
So with the DSLR, it's
more of a, you know,

60
00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.930
more of a pure photography
experience. I would say, where

61
00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.870
you're seeing exactly what the
glass is saying, as opposed

62
00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.420
to what the camera is
interpreting. I've had a number

63
00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.430
of times when I've moved
the camera really close to

64
00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.470
a point and shoot, and
try to take a picture

65
00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.110
of like a bee or
something. Look through the viewfinder,

66
00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.120
taking the picture and found
out that I was, you

67
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.100
know, an inch off from
what I thought I was.

68
00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.220
Cause I wasn't really seeing
Reality. Right? Yeah. With the

69
00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.130
DSLR generally, exactly what you
see is what you're going

70
00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.540
to get there. Usually with
most of the lower end

71
00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.840
and mid grade DSLRs, usually
what you're seeing through the

72
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.540
viewfinder is 85 to 90%
of what you're going to

73
00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.850
see in the actual picture.
Usually there's just a little

74
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.190
margin around that doesn't show
up in the viewfinder, but

75
00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.950
will show up on your
picture. Some of the higher

76
00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.620
end DSLRs, at least with
the cannons, they actually have

77
00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.530
a full, you know, you'll
get 100% coverage of the

78
00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.680
field of view. I bought
a Nikon D 40, would

79
00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.100
that be considered a very
low level entry level DSLR?

80
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:29.010
Yes. When it comes to
DSLRs, there's really Canon and

81
00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.710
Nikon are the big players
in the market. The there's

82
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.780
other companies, Sony, Olympus, Pentax
that have DSLRs. But really

83
00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.440
when you're talking about the
DSLR market, Canon and Nikon

84
00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.040
are the big players and
they each make, you know,

85
00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.370
several different DSLRs, you know,
ranging from their entry level

86
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.390
ones. Like your <inaudible> Canon's
entry level. One is their,

87
00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.740
their rebel XT, her STI,
you know, and those, you

88
00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.170
know, price wise, you're looking
at around, you know, $500

89
00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:00.750
at that point, you know,
all the way up to

90
00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.280
their top of the line,
professional grade cameras, you know,

91
00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:09.000
which, you know, at that
point you're talking maybe, you

92
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.930
know, 10 or $12,000 just
for the camera body. Wow.

93
00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:14.940
10 or 20 quick, 12,
10, or 12 grand for

94
00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.730
the body. Right? No lens
that's yeah. That's just the

95
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:19.920
bottom. I felt the $400
I spent on my camera

96
00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.260
was an excessive amount of
money. And I actually went

97
00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:27.420
and bought the <inaudible> having
seven megapixels while the <inaudible>

98
00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.260
X has 10. And I
don't miss those extra three

99
00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:33.840
megapixels for the, for the
400 extra dollars. It would

100
00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.420
have cost me, I'm feeling
pretty good about my camera.

101
00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.790
And interestingly enough, the quality
of photograph that I get

102
00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:41.640
out of a, this my
Nikon D 40 DSLR with

103
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:46.860
seven megapixels is visibly and
significantly better than the same.

104
00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.760
And I'm saying same in
air quotes, same seven megapixels.

105
00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.890
I got out of my
point of view. Yes. And

106
00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:56.340
that's, that's one of the
things that the camera marketing

107
00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:59.990
folks will love to tell
you that more megapixels is

108
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:03.230
better and to a certain
extent it is, but there's

109
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:05.120
reality as well. I mean,
the reality is you can

110
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.060
make a perfectly good eight
by 10 print from, you

111
00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.870
know, a good three or
four megapixel photo. And if

112
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:13.850
you're talking about stuff to
put up on the web,

113
00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:17.390
I mean really a three
megapixel cameras, more than you

114
00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:19.310
need for a photo, that's
going to be viewed on,

115
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:22.550
you know, even a 20
or 22 inch computer monitor.

116
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:26.990
The DSLRs are going to
take a, for lack of

117
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:28.760
a better term, a better
quality picture at a bar,

118
00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.730
you know, in the same
megapixel range because they have

119
00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:35.210
better sensors, they have bigger
sensors. So with a point

120
00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:38.630
and shoot, you know, there's
charts available online where you

121
00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:40.250
can compare these with a
point and shoot, it's going

122
00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.110
to be a smaller sensor.
It's not going to be

123
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.750
as high quality as with
a DSLR. So in an

124
00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:47.930
entry level, DSLR we'll have
a higher quality image sensor

125
00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.630
than, you know, a mid
grade or probably even some

126
00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:52.550
of the top of the
line point and shoot. So,

127
00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:55.330
And these are the, they
call the CCD or CMOs

128
00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:59.440
sensor Yes. And Canon and
Nikon. They kind of do

129
00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.710
their own things with them,
you know, depending on how

130
00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:07.240
they're doing it. You know,
some of them use a

131
00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:11.290
sensor that's an equivalent to,
so that what you see

132
00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:15.160
through a focal length lens
is the same as what

133
00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.260
you'd see on a 35
millimeter with that same focal

134
00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.810
length lens. Some of them
have what's called a crop

135
00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:24.190
factor. So that from a
crop factor, as in like

136
00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:28.150
cropping an image to make
it smaller, and most of

137
00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:31.660
the cannons and the Nikons
until you get into their

138
00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:35.410
real high end models all
have anywhere from a 1.4

139
00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:38.020
to a 1.6 crop factor.
So what that means is

140
00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:43.120
if you put a, a
50 millimeter lens, which, you

141
00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.460
know, on a 35 millimeter
camera, we'll give you, you

142
00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:48.610
know, a certain focal length,
if you put that same

143
00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:52.930
lens onto, you know, my
Canon 40 D for example,

144
00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:55.900
as a 1.6 crap factor.
So I put a 50

145
00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:58.150
millimeter lens onto my camera,
and it gives me the

146
00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:01.480
equivalent of what you would
see at like, was, I

147
00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:04.540
guess it'd be about 85
millimeters, roughly on a 35

148
00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:07.840
millimeter camera. And that's just
based on how much of

149
00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:10.570
what the lens takes in
ends up being projected onto

150
00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:12.640
that image sensor. I'm looking
at the top of your

151
00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:15.400
camera here. And it says
18 to 15 Five millimeters.

152
00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:18.100
And that seems like different
numbers than what I got

153
00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:20.940
with the stock lens. And
that that's indicating that your,

154
00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:24.310
your lens can do what
that mine cannot. The 18

155
00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:28.840
to 55 is a basically
that's giving the range. This

156
00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.820
is a zoom lens, so
I can zoom it in

157
00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:33.640
or out to get wider
or a more of a

158
00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:38.860
zoom on my picture. 18
to 55 is a relatively,

159
00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:43.270
you know, 18 is a
relatively wide angle lens. So

160
00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:45.190
at that range, I'm getting
up, you know, more of

161
00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:49.090
a scene into the picture
at 55 millimeters, that's more

162
00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:52.240
of a normal focal range
that you might use for

163
00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:56.910
a portrait, or just some
general indoor. You can get

164
00:08:56.910 --> 00:09:01.380
lenses that are wider. Some
of the widest lenses that

165
00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:02.760
you can get, you know,
are going to be like

166
00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:04.860
in the 10 millimeter range
that are going to actually

167
00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:07.470
be able to see more
than you would see just

168
00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:11.360
standing and looking forward, A
larger, a larger with the

169
00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:16.070
field than the human eye
would have Exactly getting into

170
00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:18.170
fisheye lenses and things like
that. You can get into

171
00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:20.990
the fish eyes. And then,
you know, on the other,

172
00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.300
the opposite spectrum is you
can get really, really, really

173
00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:27.590
long lenses. You know, there's
a lens manufacturer called Sigma

174
00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:29.690
that just came out with
a zoom lens that ranges

175
00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:34.070
from 200 to 500 millimeters,
which is, you know, a

176
00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:36.800
really long lens, especially when
you start talking about multiplying

177
00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:42.110
that times 1.6. Wow. And
that's when it's, when you

178
00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:44.150
bring in the, that crop
factor, that crop factor. So

179
00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:46.640
by zooming in you're, you're
cropping out stuff that you

180
00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.070
would have ordinarily seen. Exactly.
So if I put that

181
00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:52.850
500 millimeter lens onto my
1.6 crap factor camera, I'm

182
00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:57.350
really looking at about 800
millimeters there, which is a

183
00:09:57.350 --> 00:10:01.880
long ways away. Okay. So
we were talking about f-stop

184
00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:04.640
and aperture, and I understand
the, the, the lens quality

185
00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:08.360
is important. Glass quality is
important. Sensor quality is important,

186
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:10.610
but one of the things
that I've been struggling with

187
00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:13.550
is I want those, those
kinds of shots where I'm

188
00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:16.160
taking a picture of my
kid, and he's, he's really

189
00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.550
clear, but the background is
blurry so that what we

190
00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:23.840
call focal length, where how
much of the spaces and

191
00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:27.470
focus That's actually called depth
of field is the most

192
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:30.350
common term depth of field
I got that wrong. And

193
00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:34.130
so how aperture plays into
that aperture kind of affects

194
00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:38.090
two things, an aperture being
the size of the hole

195
00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:41.060
that lets the light in
to the, to the camera

196
00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:44.090
aperture and shutter speed are
very closely related. So in

197
00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:46.880
order to get a photo
that, you know, looks good

198
00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.580
as properly exposed, you know,
and looks like real life,

199
00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.370
you have to have the
right amount of light that

200
00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:54.770
gets into the camera. And
there's two things that control

201
00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:57.680
how much light gets into
the camera. One is the

202
00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:00.140
shutter speed, which is how
long the shutter is open.

203
00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:02.450
The longer the shredder is
open, the more light gets

204
00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:05.990
in. And then the other
thing is the aperture, which

205
00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:12.110
aperture, there's a series of
blades inside a lens. I

206
00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:13.820
think when we were talking
earlier, you used the term

207
00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:15.560
sphincter, which is a good
way to think of it

208
00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:18.950
and that they will, yeah.
They will expand or contract

209
00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:22.820
to either let in more
light or less light. The

210
00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:26.300
aperture value is measured in,
what's called an F stop,

211
00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:29.990
which is actually mathematically. I
believe it's a logarithmic equation.

212
00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:33.170
So you'll see an F
stop number that might be,

213
00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.560
you know, this is an
F 2.8, or this is

214
00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:41.360
F four. This is F
11. What that number means

215
00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:48.800
is it's, it's basically inverse
to the size Low F

216
00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.320
stop. So like an F
stop of 2.8 would indicate

217
00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.920
that the aperture is quite
large. A lot of light

218
00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:56.770
is coming in so low
F a high F stop

219
00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:59.830
of like F 11 would
indicate a fairly small aperture

220
00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:02.530
in a, a fairly small
hole for the light to

221
00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:04.530
go through. Right. And so
how that will then affect

222
00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:06.950
your photos of that. If
you're taking a photo in

223
00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:09.120
a, you know, a relatively
dark area, you know, like

224
00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.280
this conference room we're sitting
in is relatively dark it's

225
00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:15.990
indoors. We would want to
use a lens that has

226
00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:18.630
a, the ability to go
to a wide aperture, which

227
00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:20.040
is a big hole, which
is going to be a

228
00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:22.710
low f-stop number. So you
might be wanting to use

229
00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:24.960
a lens that's, you know,
F 2.8 or F two,

230
00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:29.040
or even F 1.8 or
one point. Okay. So, so,

231
00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.290
so then changing the F
stop on my camera, on

232
00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:33.900
my new deal at DSLR.
This is assuming I'm choosing

233
00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:38.970
not to say auto. I
want to have manual configuration

234
00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:42.150
abilities here. If I make
a really low F stop,

235
00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:44.520
meaning a very large aperture,
that sounds like a lot

236
00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:46.530
of lights going to come
in. If I kept the

237
00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:48.540
shutter open for too long,
I'm probably gonna get a

238
00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:52.140
big white picture of nothing
but light, Right? Yeah. If

239
00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:54.870
you, if you end up
overexposing the photo, you'll end

240
00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:57.030
up with just a big
white screen. And so that

241
00:12:57.030 --> 00:13:00.240
indicates that you either need
to use a faster shutter

242
00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:03.540
speed to let in less
light via the shutter, or

243
00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:07.500
adjust your aperture to a
smaller aperture value to less

244
00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:10.050
it, you know, let less
light in through the hole.

245
00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.060
Okay. Okay. So let me
ask you this. And I'm,

246
00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.580
I'm thinking about this in
terms of high school math,

247
00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:19.260
is it possible that I
could take, you know, one

248
00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:23.490
shutter speed and one aperture
size and then find another

249
00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:25.770
aperture size and shutter speed
and get the exact same

250
00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:28.710
picture. Even though one had
a big aperture when have

251
00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:30.870
a small, but I adjusted
them such. They cancel each

252
00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:32.820
other out and I was
taking essentially the same picture.

253
00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:38.070
Yes, that's that's exactly what
happens. A one f-stop is

254
00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:40.680
defined as a doubling of
the amount of light that

255
00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:45.750
will come in. So one
f-stop like moving from F

256
00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:50.190
two to F 2.8 is
considered one complete F stop.

257
00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:53.760
So at F 2.8, it
will let in half as

258
00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:56.550
much light as it does
at F two. Okay. So

259
00:13:56.550 --> 00:14:00.240
if your shutter speed is
twice as long, so from

260
00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:03.780
200 to say from one,
200th of a second to

261
00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:09.060
one, 400th of a second,
you know, by, with that

262
00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:11.250
doubling with that, you know,
doubling in the shutter speed,

263
00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:14.310
in theory, you should get
a photo that's exposed and

264
00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:17.220
would look exactly the same.
Interesting. Now, would it look

265
00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:19.530
exactly the same or would
I have changed the depth

266
00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:22.410
of field? That's that's the
variable that's. The other thing

267
00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:26.700
that aperture affects is that
the, the wider, the aperture

268
00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:28.920
that you go to. So
the smaller, the F stop

269
00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:32.970
number, you're going to have
a eight shallower or a

270
00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:35.730
narrower depth of field and
depth of field. Basically, you're

271
00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:38.400
measuring, you know, if I'm
sitting across from you at

272
00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:40.290
the table and I take
a photo and I focus

273
00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:45.510
on the front of your
nose, for example, at a

274
00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:49.140
wide aperture, low F stop,
I'm going to have a

275
00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:52.460
shallower depth of field than
I it'll, you know, at

276
00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:55.130
a narrower aperture and a
larger f-stop. So if I

277
00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:57.500
take the photo at, for
example, F 1.8, and I

278
00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:59.960
focus on the tip of
your nose, what I am

279
00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.730
going to find is that
by the time I'm looking

280
00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:03.560
at your ears, they're going
to be blurry in the

281
00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:06.800
photo because it's a really
shallow depth of field. On

282
00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:09.500
the other hand, if I
took the photo at say

283
00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:12.860
F 5.6, probably your ears
are still going to be

284
00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:16.310
in good focus. So that's
the other consideration when you're

285
00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:18.920
looking at, you know, which
aperture do I want to

286
00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:21.830
choose as if you want
to produce an effect, like

287
00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:24.170
you mentioned, you wanted to
get a picture of, you

288
00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:26.210
know, your kids where, you
know, they're in focus in

289
00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:29.330
the black background is blurry.
You're going to want to

290
00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:32.150
do that so that, you
know, you're gonna want to

291
00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:35.050
use a relatively low F
stuff for that. Okay. I'm

292
00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:36.580
going to hold that thought,
because I'm going to ask

293
00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:38.500
you a question about that
in just a moment, but

294
00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:40.450
briefly we need to thank
our sponsors and pay the

295
00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:44.050
bills. We'll be right back.
Hi, it's Scott Hanselman here.

296
00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:45.910
Hope you're enjoying the show
so far. I'm coming at

297
00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:48.190
you from another place in
time. Sorry to interrupt the

298
00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:49.480
show, but I want to
let you know that putting

299
00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:52.360
together a podcast like this
every week, isn't free folks

300
00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:54.880
that pay the bandwidth bill
is Tellerik. They make the

301
00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:56.860
show possible. And they also
make some pretty cool products

302
00:15:56.860 --> 00:16:00.190
like Telerik site affinity. It's
a development platform for constructing

303
00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:03.550
websites, community portals, and Internet's
built all on asp.net. <inaudible>.

304
00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:06.880
So you're using the various
well-known goodies, like master pages

305
00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:09.820
and membership services, data model
provider, things that you already

306
00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:12.970
know. It's pretty flexible. You've
got a very robust core

307
00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:14.890
that you can customize. You
can plug in anything that

308
00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:18.310
you want from complex applications,
for CRM, or just a

309
00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:20.800
little widget that displays the
weather. If you're not big

310
00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:23.230
into the code thing, that's
cool to get a full

311
00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:25.750
set of features out of
the box, like workflow multi-lingual

312
00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:28.660
sites, content, versioning that can
all be added without code.

313
00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:31.540
There's also a whole bunch
of pluggable modules and components

314
00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:34.900
for news blogs, forums, polls
lists. This is all stuff

315
00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:37.060
that you can do without
code. And it's pretty good

316
00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:39.430
looking product as well. You've
got a nice web 2.0

317
00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:42.280
administrative interface that lets you
as well as your boss.

318
00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:44.560
Who's not technical and be
really productive. So check out

319
00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:47.980
site affinity.com and we'll get
you right back to the

320
00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:51.430
show. Thanks a lot. Alright,
so you're starting to get

321
00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:53.320
my head around this, and
I'm feeling a little better

322
00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:56.080
about my, my potential for,
for being a decent photographer.

323
00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:59.530
So talking back about taking
a picture of my son,

324
00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:02.800
such that he's in focus
in the background is, is

325
00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:06.250
blurry, but he moves really
fast. It's tough to get

326
00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:08.800
him to sit still if
I want a shot of

327
00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:12.490
him at crystal clear, but
I also want the background

328
00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:14.350
to be blurry. I feel
like maybe I've got two

329
00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:16.450
things that are at odds,
because if I understand from

330
00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:19.210
what you're saying, if he's
moving fast, I'm gonna need

331
00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:22.900
a fast shutter speed. So
as to capture him in

332
00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:27.160
motion, without blur, but by
doing that, I may not

333
00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:30.130
get the blurry background that
I'm looking for. Right. And

334
00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:34.870
so that's where this is
where you start to get

335
00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:38.320
a little bit into what
you're, what you're paying for

336
00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:43.450
when you buy better lenses,
is that the, you know,

337
00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:46.750
the very high quality lenses
that will go to a

338
00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:50.100
very wide aperture, like an
F one point for example,

339
00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:54.960
you know, an F 1.2,
we'll let you to let

340
00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:57.150
as much light in as
possible, you know, through that

341
00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:01.200
wide aperture, meaning that you
can use a shorter shutter

342
00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:04.920
speed as opposed to, you
know, like a consumer grade

343
00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:07.220
lens, like the one that
came with your, you know,

344
00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:09.720
with your camera kit or
the one, you know, actually

345
00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:11.910
the one that I have
on now, you know, the

346
00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:15.480
absolute widest aperture that this
is going to go to

347
00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:18.780
is maybe an F 3.5
or even an F 4.5.

348
00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:21.660
So it just simply won't
be possible to do that

349
00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:25.020
with this lens. So that's
why, you know, that's why

350
00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:27.090
they make a wide variety
of lenses. And depending on

351
00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:29.730
how much money you have,
you know, like a, an

352
00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:32.880
F 1.2 lens, you know,
at a portrait length may

353
00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:36.290
run you $2,000 for a
lens, Is that I'm paying

354
00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:39.020
for it. Why, why make
that so difficult to pay

355
00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:41.450
to for, for Joe public
on the street to have

356
00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:47.600
The biggest factor is to
get that wider aperture, you've

357
00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:53.540
got more glass and more
finally precision engineered glass in

358
00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:56.120
that lens. It will be
a very heavy lens if

359
00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:57.830
you were to hold it
in your hand, you know,

360
00:18:57.830 --> 00:19:02.180
an F 1.2 lens versus
an F 5.6 lens, there's

361
00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:05.180
going to be a huge,
huge weight difference. And so

362
00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:07.220
it's, it's the build quality.
It's the precision of the

363
00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:09.200
engineering. It's the R and
D that, you know, the

364
00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:12.620
lens manufacturer has done to
be able to, to engineer

365
00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:14.600
something to do that, You
know, in, in my, in

366
00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:18.080
my brief experience as a,
I guess I'm a prosumer

367
00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:20.900
now, not just a consumer,
but a prosumer professional consumer,

368
00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:22.970
you know, I'm going to
come in to answer a

369
00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:26.390
photographer here. The bodies all
seen about the same size.

370
00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:28.610
I would think that the
size of the aperture can

371
00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:32.150
only get so big. Otherwise
it's completely letting in as

372
00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:34.550
much light as is, as
is possible to enter the

373
00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:38.300
body. Are there high end
cameras? You might watch the

374
00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:41.390
Olympics on that are going
to have giant apertures that

375
00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:47.900
are custom, Generally the camera
body itself. It's all coming

376
00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:51.620
into a sensor and the
sensors are relatively small and

377
00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:54.050
that, you know, the sensor
in your camera, you know,

378
00:19:54.050 --> 00:19:58.700
the sensor in my camera
is probably, you know, comparable

379
00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:02.990
to like the size of
a postage stamp. So ultimately

380
00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:06.860
that's where the image is
going to, so, yeah, like

381
00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:09.320
you watch like an NFL
game or the Olympics or

382
00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:11.870
something. You will see guys
on the sidelines with these

383
00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:17.300
giant lenses, which, you know,
again, they're dealing with giant

384
00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:19.430
lenses with lots of glass
that will go to really

385
00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:22.940
wide apertures, but eventually it's
all, you know, as the

386
00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:25.940
image passes through that lens,
it gets reflected down onto,

387
00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:28.460
or very small area. So
I actually seen those guys

388
00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:30.920
with tripods for the camera
and then another tripod for

389
00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:34.010
the end of the giant
lens. Yeah. Yeah. That's and

390
00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:37.190
that's because some of those
lenses will weigh, you know,

391
00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:41.510
you know, 10, 12, 15
pounds just for the lens,

392
00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:43.310
because there's so much glass
in it and it's just,

393
00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:46.400
you can't hand hold it
steady at that point. Now,

394
00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:48.340
one of the features I
noticed in my new camera

395
00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:51.010
Is that there's JPEG, of
course, but there's also this

396
00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:55.170
raw, or I think it
was called NEF Raw. Yeah,

397
00:20:56.730 --> 00:20:59.910
pretty much you need DSLR.
And most of the higher

398
00:20:59.910 --> 00:21:03.360
end point and shoots now
have the ability to record

399
00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:07.590
an image and raw format.
And raw format is a

400
00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:13.230
proprietary format that comes from
the camera manufacturer, Nikon their

401
00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:17.280
file extension is, you know,
NEF cannons currently is a

402
00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:23.730
CRM. Their original ones were
CRW. What a raw image

403
00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:25.650
is the best way to
think of a rye image

404
00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:29.970
is that it's a digital
negative. It's a exact representation

405
00:21:30.030 --> 00:21:34.230
of the data directly off
of the camera sensor, which

406
00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:36.810
is really cool because it
means in that raw file,

407
00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:39.480
you have every bit of
data that the camera captured.

408
00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:43.470
The downside. If there is
one, is that it's a

409
00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:46.890
negative, it requires some processing.
You can't just put a

410
00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:49.980
raw file on the web
and say, you know, browse

411
00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:52.650
to my webpage, I've embedded
these raw files in it

412
00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:56.670
because, you know, it's, it's
not a computer readable image

413
00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:59.670
file through any of the
standard means at that point.

414
00:22:00.030 --> 00:22:02.730
So a raw file will
require some processing to turn

415
00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:05.970
it into a JPEG or
a TIFF or some other

416
00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:09.360
format that can be widely
read. Well, I went up

417
00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:11.850
on the web and found
that there was a release

418
00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:14.700
a while back for, for
Vista and also for XP

419
00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:17.130
to read raw files and
see thumbnails of them. But

420
00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:19.020
you have to go to
the camera manufacturer and get

421
00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:21.660
that driver. And I went
up and found a Nikon

422
00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:23.550
raw file thing that would
allow them to show up

423
00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:27.240
and explore, but it only
worked on 32 bit windows,

424
00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:29.100
which I thought was ironic
because if I had such

425
00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:31.590
a big file, wouldn't I
like a 64 bit operating

426
00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:34.050
system to edit it on.
Yeah. That's, that's one of

427
00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:37.770
the things where, because it
is a proprietary format, the

428
00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:42.480
camera manufacturers like to, they're
not necessarily real open about

429
00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:46.770
releasing all the specs for
their format. And so the

430
00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:50.340
manufacturers that make raw processing
software often they even have

431
00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:54.180
to reverse engineer these things,
but yeah, Canon and Nikon

432
00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:56.520
and the manufacturers they'll release,
you know, essentially it's a

433
00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:58.830
Kodak. Like you have an
audio codec that reads an

434
00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:03.090
audio file. You have a
raw file Kodak that lets

435
00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:07.440
windows interpret a raw file.
But yeah, as you've discovered

436
00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:14.190
much like any other manufacturer
specific hardware or software, you're

437
00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:16.740
kind of at the whim
of that manufacturer to get

438
00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:18.840
that, to support the platforms
you want, I would expect

439
00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:23.070
that Nikon would be releasing
something for 64 bit Vista.

440
00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:25.440
Cause it's not that obscure
of a thing anymore. I

441
00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:28.080
think so I did notice
that raw support was built

442
00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:32.010
into Google's Picasa application, which
didn't require any codex to

443
00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:34.140
be installed, which was kind
of clever they'd reverse engineered

444
00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:38.700
something. And also, I guess,
windows live galleries got some

445
00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:41.070
support for that kind of
stuff, but don't most people

446
00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:43.110
just use this thing as
it light room on windows

447
00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:47.030
and an aperture on a,
the Mac there's When you

448
00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:51.380
get into the people that
are doing it seriously for

449
00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:55.190
raw processing, there's a whole
kind of industry of raw

450
00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:59.990
processing software. Adobe has a,
it's essentially a Photoshop plugin

451
00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:05.180
called Adobe camera raw, which
integrates with Photoshop or Lightroom

452
00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:06.920
or any of their recent
products. And we'll do raw

453
00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:11.150
processing. Apple has a product
called aperture that does raw

454
00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:16.790
processing. There's other standalone kind
of niche applications. There's one

455
00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:22.490
called capture one. There's some
other there's one called biblical.

456
00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:25.220
I believe it is that
all they do is Rob

457
00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:30.770
process and then Lightroom, which
you mentioned those raw processing,

458
00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:34.280
but it also does some,
a little bit of digital

459
00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:36.500
asset management, which is kind
of a whole nother software

460
00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:39.140
field of if you're out
shooting, you know, I mean,

461
00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:41.270
I'm shooting startup Palooza, which
is an event here in

462
00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:44.630
Portland this weekend. I'm probably
going to shoot, you know,

463
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:47.750
hundreds or, you know, potentially
over a thousand images on

464
00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:51.290
Saturday. How do you manage
that many images so that

465
00:24:51.290 --> 00:24:52.910
you can find what you're
looking for? And so there's

466
00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:55.430
this whole other category of
software. Are you going to,

467
00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:57.200
this is an interesting thing.
It's just, I just thought

468
00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:59.120
of, are you going to
delete photos on the camera

469
00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:00.710
or do you always wait
to get home before you

470
00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:05.540
delete a photo? Yes and
no. I will occasionally delete

471
00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:09.620
photos in the field. You
don't want to delete photos

472
00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:11.510
in the field based on
what you see on a

473
00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:14.240
two or three inch LCD
previous screen, based on how

474
00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:17.210
it looks on that screen.
You know, what you see

475
00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:19.760
on a two inch or
three inch screen on your

476
00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:23.450
camera, as far as trying
to gauge an exposure or

477
00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:27.650
gauge whether something is necessarily
tech sharp quite often will

478
00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:29.540
be very different than when
you get that on your

479
00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:31.670
computer monitor. And you're looking
at it at full size

480
00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:35.900
where I will delete photos
in the field, or what

481
00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:39.200
you can do in the
field that is useful is

482
00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:42.980
if you look at your
camera, any of the DSLRs

483
00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:44.720
will allow you to show
what a it's called a

484
00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:49.730
histogram, which is essentially a
graph and a well exposed

485
00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:51.800
photo. It will look like
a bell curve. And it's

486
00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:55.220
showing you a graph of
the tonal range of the

487
00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:58.040
photo with all the range
of values from light to

488
00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:01.180
dark and how much light
versus dark there is. That

489
00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:04.190
is mine always go off
to one side. So yeah,

490
00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:06.560
if you're, if you're looking
at your histogram and you

491
00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:09.140
see that you're consistently, you
know, off to one side

492
00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:11.480
or some images after one
side or the other, it

493
00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:14.810
means that you've probably overexposed
or underexposed the photo a

494
00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:17.450
bit, depending on how bad
it is, you know, it

495
00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:20.510
might be perfectly fine, you
know, and you have to

496
00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:22.730
take into account what you're
shooting. I mean, you know,

497
00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:25.820
like shooting outdoors in the
snow is notoriously difficult because

498
00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:28.340
you don't want to, you
know, blow out the white.

499
00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:31.520
You don't want to overexpose
all that white so that

500
00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:34.010
the camera loses that data.
But on the other hand,

501
00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:36.020
you want to grab the
detail of whatever's in the

502
00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:39.890
snow. So where I will
delete images in the field

503
00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:42.380
might be that, you know,
I've shot a photo and

504
00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:44.370
I want to take a
look and see, ah, okay,

505
00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:47.910
so I was shooting in,
Oh, wow. I overexposed this

506
00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:52.050
bright area on the ceiling.
Or, you know, I got

507
00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:54.960
the foreground exposed correctly, but
maybe the background I'm shooting

508
00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:57.120
against some sort of a
white sky or something. And

509
00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:58.640
so Just can't you fix
some of that after the

510
00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:00.890
fact, I mean, like one
of the things that Carl Franklin,

511
00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:03.440
my producer said that when
we first started podcasting was

512
00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:06.710
he said for God's sake,
don't overdrive the mic. And

513
00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:09.200
that's like the white area
on the photo at that

514
00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:11.960
point. There's nothing I can
do about that. You have

515
00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:14.540
exactly the same thing with
a digital image and that,

516
00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:17.870
you know, your sensor can
capture, you know, a range

517
00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:23.270
of values. And if you
vastly overexpose to the point

518
00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:26.750
where you have an overly
white area or vast Lander

519
00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:28.340
exposed to the area where
you just have a huge

520
00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:31.670
area, that's pitch black, you
won't be able to fix

521
00:27:31.670 --> 00:27:34.520
that no matter how much
post-processing you do. If you

522
00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:36.680
get really close to that,
a lot of times you

523
00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:40.880
can recover some detail and
the Canon cameras. And I

524
00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:44.270
believe the Nikon cameras have
a function where you can

525
00:27:44.270 --> 00:27:47.450
tell the camera, like on
my 40 D and on

526
00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:49.670
my previous camera, which was
a 300 D one of

527
00:27:49.670 --> 00:27:52.340
the digital rebels, there was
an option to say, when

528
00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:54.710
I'm looking at a photo
in the preview, if I

529
00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:57.650
have blown out an area
to completely overexpose it, where

530
00:27:57.650 --> 00:28:00.440
it's just white hat, have
that area flash on the

531
00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:03.670
view screen. For me, Mine's
stuck in that mode. It

532
00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:05.930
takes all the white and
flip flips back and forth,

533
00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:08.810
white to black. So if
you're seeing that, what that's

534
00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:12.320
telling you is that this
area is so light, that

535
00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:14.510
the camera can't interpret it.
It's going to come out

536
00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:17.120
as absolute, complete white. There
is no data. There is

537
00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:19.970
no data there at that
point. So depending on your

538
00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:22.070
image, that's the kind of
thing I'll look for in

539
00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:24.740
the field. And if I've
completely screwed something up like

540
00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:27.440
that, you know, if I
have the ability to reshoot

541
00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:32.270
something, I will, but generally
disc spaces, cheap memory cards

542
00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:35.720
are cheap. I'm going to,
you know, I'm not going

543
00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:38.900
to start massively deleting things
out in the field, you

544
00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:40.310
know, because there's a lot
of work you can do.

545
00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:43.670
Post-processing It sounds like we,
now, now that space is

546
00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:47.450
not non-issue when I bought
the, the D 40, I

547
00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:51.050
ended up buying for two
gig cards because I remember

548
00:28:51.050 --> 00:28:55.970
actually being out in, we
were in Africa in 2001,

549
00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.440
we were in Zimbabwe and
we had an Kodak. I

550
00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:03.830
want to say it was
a two 40 something. It

551
00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:06.890
was, it was the big
square Kodak first, you know,

552
00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:09.770
1.2 megapixel camera. I had
one of those. I said,

553
00:29:09.770 --> 00:29:11.420
it was, it was a
deep, It was like a

554
00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:13.370
two 40 or two 20,
or I think I had

555
00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:16.280
a two 20, You had
a compact flash. And it

556
00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:19.760
was the funniest looking camera.
And I went to Africa

557
00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:22.670
with a 16 Meg. Yeah.
I think it came with

558
00:29:22.670 --> 00:29:24.710
an eight Meg card. And
I recall having like a

559
00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:26.960
16, and I think at
some point I bought a

560
00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:29.240
32 Meg card and I
thought that was the biggest

561
00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:31.970
deal ever. Now, now on
a 32 maid card, I

562
00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:34.610
could fit maybe two images
out of my current camera.

563
00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:38.560
Yeah. And if you're not
shooting raw. Yeah. Yeah. The,

564
00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:41.410
the RA that's the other
downside to Roz, you know,

565
00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:43.810
a raw image because it's
a capture of all of

566
00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:46.870
the data, you know, a
raw image off of, you

567
00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:49.420
know, a 10 or 12
megapixel camera is probably going

568
00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:52.210
to be, you know, 10
to 15 megabytes, you know,

569
00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:54.220
whereas a JPEG might be,
you know, two to three

570
00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:57.240
megabyte. Yeah. I remember having
to delete photos cause we

571
00:29:57.240 --> 00:30:00.570
were there for a month
and that was a problem.

572
00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:02.970
And you, you know, at
that point, you, if you

573
00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:05.250
wanted another, you know, 16
Meg card that was going

574
00:30:05.250 --> 00:30:07.320
to cost you a few
hundred dollars now, you know,

575
00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:10.050
I just picked up a
four gig card for, you

576
00:30:10.050 --> 00:30:15.360
know, like $30. Yeah. So
today on, on Twitter, you

577
00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:19.290
and I both noticed that
there's Photoshop express now of

578
00:30:19.290 --> 00:30:24.300
flash-based online Photoshop, but I
frankly I was kinda disappointed.

579
00:30:24.330 --> 00:30:27.930
It was more of a,
it looked like Picasa or

580
00:30:27.930 --> 00:30:29.940
windows live photo gallery or
any one of the many

581
00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:33.630
different photo management applications with
a button for red eye

582
00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:36.600
and a button for fix.
But it wasn't really Photoshop.

583
00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:40.470
No, that's, that's one of
my, you know, I think

584
00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:42.750
it's cool that companies are
releasing things like this on

585
00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:46.680
the web, especially for free,
but calling it Photoshop is

586
00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:50.820
really a misnomer because you
know, you go in there

587
00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:53.220
and yeah, there's some good
picture editing tools. You can

588
00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:56.490
adjust, you know, the color
spectrum you can address sharpening.

589
00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:59.070
You can do things like
that. It's a useful tool,

590
00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:02.490
but it's not really Photoshop.
The UI doesn't look like

591
00:31:02.490 --> 00:31:04.680
Photoshop and a lot of
what Photoshop can do it

592
00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:07.710
can't, there's no layer there's
no, yeah, it's, it's a

593
00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:10.620
very basic tool, you know,
it's worth all of what

594
00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:13.710
it costs you to use
it. You know, it's a

595
00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:15.510
good free editor enemy. If
you need to make a

596
00:31:15.510 --> 00:31:17.970
quick fix on a photo,
there's nothing wrong with it,

597
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.120
but it's not really comparable
to Photoshop. If people are

598
00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:24.090
looking for, you know, if
people are wanting to seriously

599
00:31:24.090 --> 00:31:27.930
do some, you know, real
post-processing on their images, you

600
00:31:27.930 --> 00:31:29.520
can do a little bit
with the free stuff like

601
00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:33.210
that, or with Picasa or,
you know, paint.net, even as

602
00:31:33.210 --> 00:31:38.190
an open source, you know,
dot net application, if you

603
00:31:38.190 --> 00:31:39.600
will kind of want to
get a little bit beyond

604
00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:42.300
what you can do with
the free tools. I encourage

605
00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:46.350
people to look at Photoshop
elements, which is, I think

606
00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:50.100
street prices around $80. It's
a stripped down version of

607
00:31:50.130 --> 00:31:53.850
the full version of Photoshop,
but it's really designed for

608
00:31:53.850 --> 00:31:57.060
processing digital photos. It has
the functionality you need to

609
00:31:57.060 --> 00:32:00.270
apply filters and do layers
and things like that. It

610
00:32:00.270 --> 00:32:02.670
doesn't have some of the
advanced stuff Photoshop does for

611
00:32:02.790 --> 00:32:06.360
drawing or, you know, CMY
K print processing and things

612
00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:09.810
like that. But for editing
digital photos that it's really,

613
00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:12.960
you know, unless you want
to go spend 600, $700

614
00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:16.410
on the full version of
Photoshop, you know, Now you

615
00:32:16.410 --> 00:32:17.940
had noticed, you had mentioned
to me just before we

616
00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:20.490
started recording that you'd noticed
something a little maybe possibly

617
00:32:20.490 --> 00:32:23.700
disturbing in the end user
license agreement for this little

618
00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:25.590
service here. Cause I know
that as a, as a

619
00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:28.530
moving into a professional photography,
you're starting thinking about copyright,

620
00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:32.940
Copyright and licensing is something
that, you know, people need

621
00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:35.400
to think about. You know,
even if you're just sharing

622
00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:37.590
your images for fun on
a site like flicker or

623
00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:41.120
Picasso or something like that,
you know, you know, potentially

624
00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:42.740
you're putting things out on
the internet. Do you want

625
00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:45.050
people to be able to
use it, you know, flickers

626
00:32:45.050 --> 00:32:47.120
great, and that they let
you easily apply a creative

627
00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:49.940
commons license. If you want
to have someone use it

628
00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:53.240
for a noncommercial purpose, someone
tipped me off to go

629
00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:56.720
look at the terms of
service on Photoshop express, which

630
00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:59.990
is what they're calling their
free version and buried down.

631
00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:03.680
I think it's section eight
is the licensing section and

632
00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:06.440
buried down in section eight
of the terms of service.

633
00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:11.780
It says, yeah, I'm paraphrasing
here, but by uploading photos

634
00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:14.900
to their free hosting gallery
section, which is kind of

635
00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:16.730
the other component to it,
you can edit photos and

636
00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:19.270
they will also, they give
you Separate from edit. You

637
00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:21.760
can edit and, and bring
them back down to your

638
00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:23.350
own machine and they never
get posted on the board

639
00:33:23.710 --> 00:33:25.990
Or you can upload them
and edit them and save

640
00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:27.970
them there. And I think
they give you two gigabytes

641
00:33:27.970 --> 00:33:32.110
of hosting space for free
by uploading anything to the

642
00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:37.840
public hosting section, you grant
Adobe, a royalty free unlimited

643
00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:41.830
license to use your images
for essentially anything they want,

644
00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:45.790
which is a bit disturbing
because I mean, potentially, you

645
00:33:45.790 --> 00:33:47.860
know, that could be them
using it for marketing. They,

646
00:33:47.890 --> 00:33:50.080
I mean, the way I
read it, as it sounded

647
00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:52.180
like they could take your
photos and go sell them,

648
00:33:52.330 --> 00:33:54.760
which Well, can you give
me keeping in mind that

649
00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:58.150
we're both, you're a photographer.
I just bought a camera

650
00:33:58.150 --> 00:34:00.580
and neither of us are
lawyers, but it does sound

651
00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:03.490
like something that people need
to start reading It's yeah.

652
00:34:03.510 --> 00:34:06.790
It's something that, you know,
like I said, I noticed

653
00:34:06.790 --> 00:34:11.500
it, I wrote a blog
post about it today. It's

654
00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:13.480
one of those things that
I think if it gets

655
00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:17.590
any publicity, Adobe is probably
going to have to rework

656
00:34:17.590 --> 00:34:19.750
those terms. You don't think
there's any chance that we

657
00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:23.290
were misinterpreting it. I, the
way I'm reading it, I,

658
00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:26.200
it sure sounds to me
like, I mean, it's pretty

659
00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:30.430
clear. You're granting Adobe a,
a license, a license to

660
00:34:30.430 --> 00:34:33.640
use the photos. You still
own the copyright on them,

661
00:34:33.850 --> 00:34:37.900
but you know, No, by
upload to flicker live now,

662
00:34:37.910 --> 00:34:40.540
you know, photos are what
Picasa or Microsoft's got live

663
00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:46.780
photos. Is there any implicit
license? Not on flicker. I'm

664
00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:49.090
a big flicker fan. I
use flicker on flicker, the

665
00:34:49.090 --> 00:34:51.760
default license. If you don't
change it is that you

666
00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:54.520
retain all rights to the
image. They're just holding it

667
00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:56.440
for you. They're just holding
it for you. Flicker makes

668
00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:59.560
it easy to assign a
creative commons license. So if

669
00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:01.450
you want to say, Hey,
people can use this. As

670
00:35:01.450 --> 00:35:03.850
long as they give me
credit and attribution, you know,

671
00:35:03.850 --> 00:35:07.210
flicker makes it easy to
do that. I haven't used

672
00:35:07.210 --> 00:35:09.880
the Microsoft live phone, The
smug mug. That's pretty sweet.

673
00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:12.280
Have you seen smug mug?
I've looked SmugMug a little

674
00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:14.140
bit. I haven't, you know,
I don't have a gallery

675
00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:17.650
there, but so that's kind
of nice. The licensing thing

676
00:35:17.650 --> 00:35:20.800
is just something that, you
know, it's one of those

677
00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:24.190
things people should be aware
of. Somebody made a comment

678
00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:27.520
on Twitter today in response
to this discussion saying that

679
00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:31.030
apparently the YouTube license also
says that, that whatever you

680
00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:34.510
put on YouTube, you're granting
YouTube and Google a license

681
00:35:34.530 --> 00:35:37.890
to do whatever they want
with. So I haven't that

682
00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:41.400
TV shows are up there.
I mean, I don't know,

683
00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:43.710
but at least the Adobe
license, I did read it

684
00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:46.950
myself. And to me it
sounds overly broad. And it's

685
00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:49.530
going to keep you from
using this tool that, you

686
00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:51.510
know, among other things like
the fact, I don't need

687
00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:53.760
somewhere else to host my
photos, but you know, if

688
00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:56.400
I was looking for a
photo host, I, I certainly

689
00:35:56.400 --> 00:36:00.240
wouldn't, you know, grant it
to somebody who just says,

690
00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:02.100
just because you post your
photos here, I can do

691
00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:03.930
whatever I want with them.
Well, it sounds like the

692
00:36:03.930 --> 00:36:06.480
moral of the story, because
again, we're, you know, we're

693
00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:08.940
just two guys with a
microphone. Is it people who

694
00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:10.530
are going to use any
kind of a hosting service

695
00:36:10.530 --> 00:36:12.180
need to read the fine
print and think about, is

696
00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:14.220
this going to serve the
purpose that I, that I

697
00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:17.580
need, but I really appreciate
you taking the time to

698
00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:19.020
sit down and talk to
me about this. I want

699
00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:21.120
to go and figure out
how to use the aperture

700
00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:23.100
and shutter speed. Now to
take pictures of my kid.

701
00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:25.110
I don't think I've ever
needed to the point where

702
00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:27.120
I'm running a professional photography
business, but I wish you

703
00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:29.400
all the best in your
new venture. Well, thank you.

704
00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:31.240
And the good thing is
with the digital camera, your,

705
00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:33.540
your film is free. So
you can play around and

706
00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:37.020
experiment and try different values
and see what happens. And

707
00:36:37.050 --> 00:36:39.270
you know, all it's going
to take is your time,

708
00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:42.720
but you know, you don't
have to try something out.

709
00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:44.610
And you know, the other
thing is that it's instant.

710
00:36:44.610 --> 00:36:46.230
You don't have to wait
two weeks for the photos

711
00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:47.940
to come back from the
lab to see what happens.

712
00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:50.970
So cool. Well, thank you,
Aaron Hockley, and I have

713
00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:52.950
been Scott Hanselman, and this
is another episode of Hansel

714
00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:54.600
minutes. They'll see you again
next week.
