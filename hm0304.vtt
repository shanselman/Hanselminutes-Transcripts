episode, Scott talks with Peter

7
00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.570
Morefield about creating applications with
phone gap. Hi, this is

8
00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.420
Scott Hanselman. This is another
episode of Hansel minutes today.

9
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.300
We're talking about mobile development
specifically with a thing called

10
00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.890
phone gap. I recently released
a windows phone, seven application.

11
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.770
I've been learning about server
light and how to write

12
00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.530
an application for windows phone
and a feeling pretty proud

13
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.210
of myself. And then I
take a look at my

14
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.390
buddy Pete's website and he's
come out with an application

15
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.750
that works on iOS and
on Android. He did it

16
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.750
with a thing called phone
gap. Thanks Pete, for coming

17
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.800
on the show. Thanks for
having me Scott. So phone

18
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.250
gap, you're not a server
like guy. How did you

19
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.230
come up with an Android
app and an iPhone app?

20
00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.890
Out of nowhere, Scott, I
was looking for an application

21
00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.260
for my boys or by
force got age to be

22
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.040
able to manage some of
their achievements, the boy Scouts,

23
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.020
I didn't see anything. And
I've always kind of wanted

24
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.020
to dip into this world
of, of iPhone and Android

25
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.810
development. And really haven't had
the cycles to go out

26
00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.960
and learn objective C and
figure out all the different

27
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.330
things I needed to do
to develop something specific for

28
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.340
each platform. So I got
to look around and I

29
00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.340
found phone gap out there,
which allows me to leverage

30
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.320
a lot of the skills
that I use every day

31
00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.510
as a, as a web
developer and being able to

32
00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.890
produce the apps kind of
on one code base, Right?

33
00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.280
You're, you're one of my
contributors to nerd dinner, you

34
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.370
and John Peterson and John Galloway have
helped me with some of

35
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:12.470
the newer versions of nerd
dinner. So I know you

36
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.450
as a, an asp.net JavaScript
kind of an expert. Do

37
00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.140
you, this phone gap, is
this an IDE like eclipse

38
00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.830
or visual studio? So foam
gap, you can think of

39
00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.410
it as a, as a
project template that you would

40
00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.820
get for each of the,
of the platforms that you

41
00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.410
want them to deliver to.
It's something that you can

42
00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.630
download and you can install,
you know, either for, you

43
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.360
know, the Mac development environment
or the Android SDK or

44
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.940
something like that. Or you
can do kind of what

45
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.870
I did. And phone gap
has a service in the

46
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.350
cloud called build. And basically
what you do with build

47
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.110
is as you package up
your HTML and then you

48
00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.010
offload it to the build
service, they wrap it up

49
00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.630
in their little project template
and then spit you back

50
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.760
binaries. Mm, okay. So I,
I have a zip file

51
00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.460
here that I downloaded from
phone gap and it's got

52
00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.070
a live folder and in,
it has got Android and

53
00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.180
Blackberry and Symbian and windows
and all this stuff, but

54
00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.730
it doesn't like have like
a start here. It's not

55
00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.430
a hundred percent clear, am
I, am I doing all

56
00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.630
this work in a text
editor? Right? So there's, there's

57
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.210
two sides to it. One
is, is, is basically what

58
00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.180
I think you downloaded. It's
these project templates that you

59
00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.250
can use and start, you
know, start working with projects

60
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.980
on your Mac or in
the Android SDK. And you

61
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.810
know, the phone gap guys
rely on you to kind

62
00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.630
of go to their Wiki
and they have some great

63
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.820
walkthroughs there that helped you
kind of get started with

64
00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.820
those. The other side of
that is, is basically the

65
00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.800
same thing. You have downloaded
that you would run on

66
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.040
your Mac, or you would
run an Android SDK, they

67
00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.550
built a service around that.
And literally you're just pushing

68
00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.040
up HTML to it. And
then they're spitting you back

69
00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.500
a binary. I see. Okay.
So I thought that somehow

70
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.960
I would be working in
like this phone gap IDE

71
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.690
and doing all my work
in one place and then

72
00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.430
pushing out different versions of
my application. But you're saying

73
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.690
that I'm actually using the
tools for the phone that

74
00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.090
I want to target. So
it's more of a pull

75
00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.040
thing. And by that, I
mean, if I want to

76
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.640
write a windows phone, phone
gap application, I'll be using

77
00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.280
the windows phone SDK, but
I'll be using the phone

78
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.500
gap libraries. And if I
want to write an iOS

79
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.320
application using PhoneGap, I'm still
going to be using X

80
00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.770
code and setting up the
project that way, Right. That's

81
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.410
one way of doing it.
And that's the way a

82
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.870
lot of people are doing
it, especially if they want

83
00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.840
to use a lot of
custom behaviors with some of

84
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.840
the hardware on the device.
I took a different approach.

85
00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.860
I don't have a Mac,
you know, I wanted to

86
00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.710
try. And that's why phone
gap IX sodomy is because

87
00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.000
I could develop for this
thing without having a Mac,

88
00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.160
basically with the build service,
they do all of that

89
00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.140
stuff, you know, building on
the Mac and setting up

90
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.000
your project and all that,
do all that for you

91
00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.850
under the covers, through the
service. And all you do

92
00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:16.590
is you build your, your
HTML package, you know, using

93
00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.380
JavaScript and CSS and do
all the things that you

94
00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.170
want to do, zip that
thing up. And you go

95
00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:24.870
onto their service, their bill
dot <inaudible> dot com. That's

96
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.300
what I think it is,
upload it. And then they

97
00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.190
spit. You just spit you
back the binary there on

98
00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:33.090
the website. Well, okay. So
there's, so there's multiple ways.

99
00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.080
So it's, I could make
templates within my local development

100
00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.900
environment, or I can do
what you just described and

101
00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.630
then their web service kind
of their, it's like a

102
00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.640
cloud of virtual machines, if
a build server in the

103
00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.540
sky, and then they'll spit
those things out. Why did

104
00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.060
you pick an Android and
iOS, if you could do

105
00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.010
it in the sky, how
come you didn't just say

106
00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:57.770
do them all Well, in
all honesty, you push to

107
00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.730
the sky, it pushes you
back everything with the, without

108
00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:03.830
with the exception of windows,
phone seven, which I think

109
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:08.630
they're working on now, I
just chose to kind of

110
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.510
put all my effort behind
getting in the store, the

111
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.600
iPhone and the Android, because
those are the two big

112
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:19.300
players in that subset. And
did you, where did you

113
00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:20.830
do your work? Were you
in a text editor or

114
00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:22.930
were you in visual studio?
I know you're a windows

115
00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:25.480
guy. Yeah. I was actually
in visual studio and it

116
00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:28.510
was just, I was just
adding HTML files and I

117
00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:30.490
use jQuery mobile to go
along with it, to kind

118
00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:33.310
of format my views. And
I was literally just using

119
00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:36.550
the text editor there in
visual studio. And then when

120
00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:38.890
I was done, no, I
wouldn't do a build. I

121
00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:41.110
would package everything up in
a zip file and ship

122
00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:44.500
it up to the phone
gap, build server. So can

123
00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.540
you just hit F five
and, and test it in

124
00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.940
like I E or Chrome,
when you want to see

125
00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:54.230
how it's going, You, you
really can, especially as you,

126
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:56.140
you know, I was using
jQuery mobile, so I can

127
00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:59.230
kind of see how things
would look kind of going

128
00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:01.060
through the process. The one
thing I learned, cause I

129
00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:03.550
wasn't testing on native devices,
I really kind of needed

130
00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:05.230
to go and try and
test on the, at least

131
00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:08.620
the browsers that were native
to that. So obviously if

132
00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:11.050
I wanted to test things
for iOS, I need to

133
00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:13.570
go in and run it
in Safari and that kind

134
00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:18.490
of stuff. Hm. So if
I, I just wrote this

135
00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:20.980
windows phone app and I
went file new project and

136
00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:23.200
I said, windows phone app.
And I wrote a bunch

137
00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:26.290
of XAML. If you're going
to write a phone gap

138
00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:29.350
application for windows phone, you
say file new phone gap

139
00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:32.380
starter. And then instead of
making a bunch of XAML

140
00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:36.730
files, you make a www
folder kind of like it's

141
00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:39.100
a web server and you
put your CSS and your

142
00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:41.380
JavaScript and everything in there.
And then when you hit

143
00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:44.890
<inaudible>, does it still look
like it should on the

144
00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:46.810
phone? Or does it look
like some kind of weird

145
00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:50.680
because you know how Java
never looked right anywhere? You

146
00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.830
know, it always looked like
Java. Well, when I do

147
00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:56.830
my testing, it looks fairly
close to what you end

148
00:07:56.830 --> 00:08:00.760
up with on the device.
It's, it's slightly different once

149
00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:02.710
you get back and sometimes
you have to trace down

150
00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:06.160
the vice specific issues. So,
you know, if you're doing

151
00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.440
this, you should, at some
point, you know, have an

152
00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:10.210
iPhone and have an Android
and be able to at

153
00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:11.770
least run it before you
try and push it to

154
00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:15.490
the store, but really that's
it, you know, it's packaged

155
00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:18.040
up the HTML and just
kind of ship off and

156
00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:21.640
forget. And you know, there's
little things here and there

157
00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:23.230
that you had to kind
of worry about, you know,

158
00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:25.000
and it's the same thing
we worry about kind of

159
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.790
as web developers, right? So
my app uses local stores

160
00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:31.660
to kind of remember things
on each device and each

161
00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:34.240
browser kind of handles local
source just a little bit

162
00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.730
differently. And so you had
to kind of find the

163
00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:38.650
way that the play with
local source that they all

164
00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:44.620
liked And the applications, as
far as like the marketplace,

165
00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:47.830
they don't know that you're
using phone gap, but there's

166
00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:49.660
not like it's not like
phone gap made a deal

167
00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:52.180
with all these marketplaces. So
you're going to still need

168
00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:54.910
like an Android manifest for
Android and you'll still need

169
00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:57.420
a windows phone manifest for
windows, phone, things like that.

170
00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:00.170
Right. Right. And that's the
good thing about the build

171
00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:03.350
services is they, if you
upload with your HTML, you

172
00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:06.110
upload a config dot XML
file that lists out a

173
00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:09.080
bunch of things like splash
screens and icons and all

174
00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:12.140
of those kinds of things
with your application and the

175
00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:15.020
binders, they spit you back,
have all that stuff built

176
00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:20.330
into it. Okay. When I
see examples of people doing

177
00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:23.180
things like this in, in
HTML, they're usually pretty basic,

178
00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:24.740
you know, maybe you see
them at a conference or

179
00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:27.260
you watch a video and
someone will go and write

180
00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.740
a calculator or something basic.
But those things usually don't

181
00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:33.530
have a database or a
web service or services behind

182
00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:37.970
them. But, but your application
is got a lot of

183
00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:40.820
information. You've got, it looks
like dozens or hundreds of

184
00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:43.730
merit, badges and details and
information about those and all

185
00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:45.530
the different things that our
boys got asked to do

186
00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:49.490
to become an Eagle scout,
HTML. Isn't something that I

187
00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:52.370
think of when I think
about databases. And since you

188
00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:54.650
don't have a server, how
are you doing that? How

189
00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:57.500
are you querying information and
putting it on the screen?

190
00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:02.350
I'm really on at this
point in the app, I'm

191
00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:07.040
using local storage to kind
of remember things. And then

192
00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.940
for, for example, for there's
136 mayor badges, I think

193
00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:15.440
it is. I, all I
did was I created a

194
00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:19.370
page for everyone, you know,
kind of just brute force

195
00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:22.640
through it. Now, you know,
there is access to kind

196
00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:27.500
of the, some database on
the device stuff that you

197
00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.330
can do in phone gap.
And I've seen a lot

198
00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:31.160
of chatter around it. I
just haven't messed with it

199
00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:34.370
too much. When you say
local DB, you're talking about

200
00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:41.150
like HTML fives, database access,
Correct. Yeah. Really? Anything, anything

201
00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:43.010
that you can do with
HTML five of these browser

202
00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:46.070
support you can do in
phone gap. And then, you

203
00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:47.840
know, again, I would kind
of be remiss not to

204
00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.660
mention that the phone get
guys have built a lot

205
00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:53.150
of plugins that allow you
to access hardware on the

206
00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:54.860
devices too. And they've done
that in a way that

207
00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:58.040
you can get, get at
through JavaScript. So if you

208
00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:01.070
wanted to do, if you
wanted to access the accelerometer

209
00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:04.070
or the cameras, stuff like
that, they've got kind of

210
00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:07.040
JavaScript, plugin API is available
through their phone gap dot

211
00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:10.160
JS that you can use
to get at hardware on

212
00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:13.310
the device to. So that
was, yeah, that was my

213
00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:17.090
next question. So first on
the database side, you can,

214
00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:20.540
you're using JavaScript, like for
example, you have a thing

215
00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:22.370
where you can search your
merit badges. So you're saying

216
00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:23.930
merit badges don't change. So
you don't need to go

217
00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:25.460
to a database for that.
You just have a hard

218
00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:27.920
coded list of the merit
badge. And then as you're

219
00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:32.600
going to start tracking progress
and enhancing the application to

220
00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.480
say, these are the badges
that I have, those things

221
00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:38.960
will then be stored in
the local database using HTML

222
00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:42.620
five. And is this because
all of these phones have

223
00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:45.080
HTML five? I mean, phone
gap is basically running a

224
00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:48.710
native app and then hosting
their own browser inside of

225
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:50.660
it, right? Like, so if
you're on iPhone, you're looking

226
00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:55.420
at Safari in inside of
That's exactly what they do

227
00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:57.790
is, is they, you know,
they have a browser view

228
00:11:57.790 --> 00:11:59.890
or browser object running it's
in their app. And then,

229
00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:02.680
but it is serving this
content backup. So when each

230
00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:05.290
team five gives you, is
this is all these browsers

231
00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:09.030
support, HTML five more or
less. And it gives you

232
00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:11.170
kind of a common development
platform to kind of do

233
00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:16.110
the same thing across each
of the devices. The, the,

234
00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:18.870
the JavaScript API is that
you're calling. So this is

235
00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:22.620
just phone gap, specific JavaScript.
And then somehow they're going

236
00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:25.080
to, they're making like window
dot external, or how are

237
00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:28.230
they letting you see the
external libraries and things like

238
00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:34.920
cameras? I don't know a
lot of that, a lot

239
00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.750
of the details behind how
they're doing some of that

240
00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:40.290
specific stuff, but What kind
of things are available? Like

241
00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:43.440
would I, would I actually
write code that says, Oh,

242
00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:46.020
this device has an accelerometer,
let my user know, and

243
00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:48.600
this device doesn't so hide
it because I realized that

244
00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.760
you can't write an application,
that's going to run perfectly

245
00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:54.870
everywhere. We would, you find
yourself saying, Oh, I'm on

246
00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:56.670
an Android. Then do this
other whole thing that I

247
00:12:56.670 --> 00:13:00.270
wouldn't be doing on another
platform. You very well could

248
00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:02.400
do that. I've seen a
lot of chatter around device,

249
00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:06.860
specific issues they've had with
different hardware stuff. And the

250
00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:08.970
guys that phone gap are
really great about kind of

251
00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:11.580
staying on top of questions
and issues that have come

252
00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:15.450
up. And they, they also
run pretty quickly through if

253
00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:18.030
they've identified issues, they'll put
out releases pretty quickly to

254
00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:21.480
address those issues. And were
you able to work from

255
00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.940
a single source? Cause as
I'm, as I'm kind of

256
00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:27.060
learning about this, I'm seeing
that there, you know, there's

257
00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:28.740
like, like you said, multiple
ways to do it. You

258
00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:32.370
can use phone gaps, layer,
abstraction, and count on them

259
00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:35.580
to do the right thing.
But if you find as

260
00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:38.220
you're developing your application, that
the main, the Android one

261
00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:40.950
just doesn't work right. The
way I want it, or

262
00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:44.370
the iPhone one, you know,
the dropdowns don't look correct.

263
00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:45.930
I mean, how many times
did you get yourself in

264
00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:48.210
a situation like that, where
it worked on one and

265
00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:49.620
not the other, and how
did you get through it?

266
00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:54.630
Right. So honestly, I went
started with the outset and

267
00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:57.030
this is where jQuery mobile
helped me start it from

268
00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:59.940
the outset of kind of
developing it kind of in

269
00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:02.700
the jQuery mobile way. So
it worked as many places

270
00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.790
as it could. The only
time that I've run into

271
00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:10.650
issues with the vice specific
and browser specific things is

272
00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:14.010
quite honestly, as in dealing
with this windows phone seven

273
00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:16.620
one that I'm trying to
get out now. And it

274
00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:19.800
doesn't like playing with the
phone gap quite as nicely

275
00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:23.040
as some of the other
things too. My phone gap

276
00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:26.520
talks about on their forums.
They do talk about the

277
00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:29.220
ongoing support for a windows
phone seven. And there's a

278
00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:32.520
guy out there, Matt Lacey,
who's got a kind of

279
00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:35.250
a windows phone, seven project
plugin that you can still

280
00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:37.560
use the same source that
you, that I ship off

281
00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:42.030
with my iPhone and Android
version. But he, it allows

282
00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:45.900
us to play a little
nicer with the browser. What

283
00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:47.580
do you, what do you
think about this, this style

284
00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:50.310
of development? Was there any
time while you were writing

285
00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:54.440
your mobile in HTML where
you wished that you just

286
00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:56.720
did it in objective C
or did it in Java

287
00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:59.860
or did it in C
sharp? Not for me there

288
00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:02.830
wasn't Scott. I mean, you
know, going out and trying

289
00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:05.200
and learning objective C and
Java and all that was,

290
00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:07.750
was my barrier to entry
in this and phone gap

291
00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:10.060
is, is what's allowed me
to kind of really dig

292
00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:14.260
in and, you know, put
something out that, you know,

293
00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:17.380
that hopefully will help people
out. And at least, you

294
00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:20.020
know, for no other reason
than just being fun for

295
00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:21.910
me to kind of ride.
But, you know, I didn't

296
00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:23.530
have a lot of time
or a lot of cycles

297
00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:26.350
to really spin up and,
you know, learn objective C

298
00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:29.170
and kind of go through
all those things. So for

299
00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:31.840
me, this is what got
me into it. If, if

300
00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:33.670
I wouldn't have found something
like this and I probably

301
00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:36.700
wouldn't even written this out,
Really, like let's say like

302
00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:38.410
you, I think you said
that really well, that, that

303
00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:40.870
learning those other platforms for
you. Cause you know, you've

304
00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:44.350
got a day job learning.
Those things is really the

305
00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:47.410
barrier. So it's like, you
know, to even go and

306
00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:52.150
start, it's just not possible.
Right. Right. And this is

307
00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:54.820
really what kind of motivated
me and got me over

308
00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:56.980
the hump to want to
go out and do this

309
00:15:58.510 --> 00:16:00.700
Now. But how come you
didn't just make this a

310
00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:03.820
website, like if you're saying
jQuery mobile and everyone's talking

311
00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:07.000
about how you can just
have someone bookmark your application,

312
00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:11.050
why, why not just make
it a website and do

313
00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:16.780
everything mobile and forget about
the phone gap part? You

314
00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:18.850
know, I very well could
have done that. I guess

315
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.640
my thing was, was to,
I wanted to get it

316
00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:25.270
in front of people as
many people as I could.

317
00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:27.370
And I knew that if
I could get it in

318
00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:30.010
the app stores or in
the marketplaces and people kind

319
00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:32.500
of search for things and
that might help me kind

320
00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:34.600
of overcome the noise of
the web, if that makes

321
00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:39.490
sense. Yeah. Yeah. Definitely. The
idea that I had, I

322
00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:42.490
wrote a blog post recently
about marketplaces and kind of

323
00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:46.780
the, the, what I call
the update. What is the,

324
00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:49.810
the update treadmill where I
feel like I'm always looking

325
00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:51.640
at my phone and I've
got 15 updates and stuff

326
00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:52.990
like that. And I just
want my apps to be

327
00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:55.210
updated, but at the same
time, it's really hard to

328
00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:59.740
charge someone 99 cents for a
bookmark. Right. And that's true.

329
00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:04.810
It's interesting that you mentioned
updates updates for me is,

330
00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:07.270
has been a bit of
a pain to be quite

331
00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:09.910
honest with you. And it's,
it's not through anything that

332
00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:11.830
phone gap has done and
it's dealing with the different

333
00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:15.220
marketplaces and kind of their,
their turnaround time when it

334
00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:19.060
comes to updates. When I,
you know, when I developed

335
00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:21.010
this, I kind of ran
the market as quick as

336
00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:23.800
I could with a V
one that was barely functional

337
00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:27.490
and didn't crash. And then
very quickly developed some updates

338
00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:29.440
for it and got some
nice graphics and that kind

339
00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:31.930
of stuff and was able
to get it out. And

340
00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:34.540
the Androids were apparently pretty
quickly, but we're now sitting

341
00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:38.050
on two weeks waiting for
that Apple sort of fruit

342
00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:43.570
to update. Have you, have
you had the, the lovely

343
00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:47.110
experience of having people review
your application and, and like,

344
00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:49.560
say like, I'm looking at
your application. It like someone,

345
00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:52.530
someone gave you a one
star review because they were

346
00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:55.500
saying that they wanted more
information, but I'm looking at

347
00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:57.660
your app and what he
wants is there. I think

348
00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:03.680
he's just screwed up. He
it's very possible. He has

349
00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:06.020
a valid point in that.
There's more information that I

350
00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:07.910
could give and then I'll
actually put that out in

351
00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:10.370
a laser version, but I'm,
I'm kinda stuck between a

352
00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:12.410
rock and a hard place
waiting to Apple to update

353
00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:15.860
the issue that update for
me, That exact same thing

354
00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:19.160
happened to me too. No,
the interesting thing is, is

355
00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:22.430
I've had a different experience
with each marketplace and I've

356
00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:25.700
got one thing pending with
the windows phone marketplace. And

357
00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:28.130
the reason it's not out
there just yet is, is

358
00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:30.110
my own fault. I'd had
did something wrong. So I

359
00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:33.710
just submitted a patch, but
Android kind of, once you

360
00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:36.290
get approved and you want
to start pushing updates, they're

361
00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:38.630
going to let you just
push updates. You know, whether

362
00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:42.080
that's right wrong or indifferent.
I don't know that, but

363
00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:45.230
you know, I push an
update and it's available that

364
00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:50.120
day with Apple man. You
know, they, they're pretty brutal,

365
00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:53.510
you know, not, not brutal
in the sense that they're

366
00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:55.760
really tough on kind of
the standards that they have,

367
00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:57.860
you know, they have their
standards and they are what

368
00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:00.830
they are. It's just, it
takes forever to get something

369
00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:04.610
through there. Yeah. I had
the same thing happened to

370
00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:08.390
me with my little application,
my little, you know, image,

371
00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:13.910
editor deal. It, I accidentally
lost three days because I

372
00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:17.060
was wandering around inside the
marketplace and I changed a

373
00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:20.660
misspelling in the description of
the application. And then when

374
00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:24.530
I hit submit, that was
a new submission for, even

375
00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:26.360
though I just changed the
misspelling, I had to wait

376
00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:32.000
a day for them to
approve it. Right. It's a

377
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.700
big problem. I mean, this,
this whole marketplace concept, the

378
00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:37.040
idea that, that there are
people in charge and I

379
00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:39.320
have to wait around. I
mean, what must that feel

380
00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:41.150
like to have a team
of dozens of people or

381
00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:44.900
hundreds working on an application,
do they all hover around

382
00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:47.630
the CEO's machine while he
hits submit? And then they

383
00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:50.420
kind of wait three days
to launch their life, their

384
00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:54.980
new startup. You know, that's
exactly a very interesting problem

385
00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:57.830
in that. Now think about
software development as a whole.

386
00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:59.180
I mean, I think we've
all kind of been there

387
00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:01.160
when we shipped something and
then some you, as soon

388
00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:03.350
as the first customer hits
it, you're like, Oh crap,

389
00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:06.350
we forgot X. And now
since you're in this marketplace

390
00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:09.080
world, if you forgot X,
it could be, who knows

391
00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:10.820
how long before you're able
to get that out. And

392
00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:13.490
then now your reputation is
solid and no one wants

393
00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:17.600
to come back to you.
Exactly, exactly. The, the amount

394
00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:21.140
of attention to detail for
these things is, is immense

395
00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:24.110
because as web programmers and
I think you and I

396
00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:26.480
are similar in this. If
you make a mistake, you've

397
00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:28.970
got a continuous integration build.
You can get that thing

398
00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:32.810
updated in an hour or
you're deploying continuously all day.

399
00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:35.630
And you just tell the
user hit F five, right?

400
00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:39.440
But if somebody, if, imagine
if someone imagine if someone

401
00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:43.070
could go to your website,
click, Oh, this sucks and

402
00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:46.990
hit one star ruin your
good review, you know, your,

403
00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:50.710
your perfect reviews and then
leave. They'll never come back

404
00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:52.210
and it's going to take
you a week to update

405
00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:56.340
it. Exactly. That's what I'm
up against right now. So,

406
00:20:56.790 --> 00:20:59.340
you know, hopefully all the,
if any of the handsome

407
00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:02.370
and listeners go out there
and grab it, they'll give

408
00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:05.310
me a nice review so
I can terrible one. I

409
00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:08.670
got, Well, I, I, I
got a couple of bad

410
00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:12.030
reviews myself. I ended up
actually reaching out to the

411
00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:15.690
guy who gave me bad
reviews. I don't know if

412
00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:17.580
you try that or not,
but apparently you can like

413
00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:21.480
on windows phone, their name
is also their, their gamer

414
00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:23.790
tag and there's Zune tag.
So you can email them

415
00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:27.510
from the Zune application. So
I dunno if that's slightly

416
00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:30.070
creepy or, or if that's
really good customer service, but

417
00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:32.190
it, the guy answered. And
he was like very nice.

418
00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:35.210
And he actually helped me
find a good bug. Okay.

419
00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:38.550
I'll tell you one thing
I learned on the windows

420
00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:41.070
phone seven side and getting
this into the windows phone

421
00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:46.800
seven marketplaces. When you have
a windows phone project open,

422
00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:49.950
there's a little thing and
there's a little menu option.

423
00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:53.760
Then they're called open marketplace
test kit. I would highly

424
00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:56.400
recommend everybody do that and
run through their set of

425
00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:58.920
tests before you submit it
to the, to the windows

426
00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:01.860
marketplace. Cause that really hit
me Really now. What is

427
00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:05.730
that? That sounds like something
I need, You know, when

428
00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:07.620
you, when you submit something
to the windows phone marketplace,

429
00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:10.050
they ask you for a
bunch of information and images

430
00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:11.970
and all kinds of stuff
like that. And then they

431
00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:14.550
ask you to upload your
binary. Well, this is something

432
00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:17.220
very similar in that you
put in your images and

433
00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:19.830
it will make sure the
images are the right size

434
00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:21.510
and all that kind of
stuff. And we'll also look

435
00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:24.720
at your binary and basically
run a set of runtime,

436
00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:27.840
you know, consider it unit
tests to see if you're

437
00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:30.030
going to make it pass
some of these automated tests

438
00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:34.590
they do in the windows
phone marketplace tests. Oh, alright.

439
00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:36.840
I gotta get this. This
sounds very, very, very useful.

440
00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:40.110
So it's kind of like
ethics cop or, you know,

441
00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:41.610
you're doing a hell of
a check disk on your,

442
00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:44.940
on your zip just to
catch the stupid things. Right.

443
00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:46.740
So when you're in a
windows phone, seven app, if

444
00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:50.850
you do project about five
down, it's open marketplace test

445
00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:53.220
kit, and then run through
that and that'll save you

446
00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:55.260
some of the headaches that
I've experienced, you know, some

447
00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:58.080
of my self-impose headaches and
getting into the windows phone

448
00:22:58.410 --> 00:23:01.440
seven marketplace. Well, see, this
is stuff I could have

449
00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:10.140
used yesterday. Well, thanks for
letting me know, Amy, Tom,

450
00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:11.670
if you want to know
something after the fact, I'm

451
00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:14.490
happy to help. Yeah, absolutely.
Now do you know if

452
00:23:14.490 --> 00:23:16.530
it's phone gap open source
or is that this is

453
00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:22.080
a product? So that's a
little gray area that I,

454
00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:25.350
as far as I know,
the company that produced phone

455
00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:28.170
gap produced it as open
source, but they were recently

456
00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:31.020
acquired by Adobe. And I
think it may have gone

457
00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:33.750
close source of late, but
don't quote me on that.

458
00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:36.660
Good. I know that you
had an, a Toby was

459
00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:39.660
acquired by Adobe. I suspect
if they're doing this thing

460
00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:43.890
in the, in, in the
cloud with the building, you

461
00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:45.770
know, building things in the
cloud, it would make sense

462
00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:47.930
to charge for that. And
it looks like the phone

463
00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:52.910
gap build does charge. One
developer can do a unlimited

464
00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:54.890
number of public applications, but
if you're gonna start doing

465
00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:58.040
private apps or corporate applications
with phone gap, then they

466
00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:00.830
start charging. But even then
it's, it's even their most

467
00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:03.880
expensive one is not that
expense. No, it's not at

468
00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:08.620
all. So, you know, I
guess more of the whole

469
00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:11.860
story is, is that, you
know, I was able to,

470
00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:16.030
without a Mac produced these,
these apps for Android and

471
00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:19.780
iPhone, you know, just by
using Phonecast and I found

472
00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:21.880
it, it was the community
is very helpful. They've got

473
00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:25.540
some great forums and news
groups that are quick to

474
00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:28.390
answer questions. And, and even
the guys like Andrew Lanae

475
00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:31.150
over there who were running
that stuff, they'll, they'll email

476
00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:34.600
you back. If you have
questions, Have you, have you

477
00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:37.390
taken this, this project that
you've done on the side

478
00:24:37.390 --> 00:24:39.820
and then thought about it
at your, at your work,

479
00:24:39.910 --> 00:24:42.130
like now that you know
how to do this, is

480
00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:43.360
this the kind of thing
where you could take to

481
00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:45.490
your boss and say, Hey,
we can make a mobile

482
00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:49.510
application for whatever we do.
It's funny. You should mention

483
00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:51.910
that Scott. In fact, it
would appear that we're going

484
00:24:51.910 --> 00:24:55.630
to start working off the
mobile apps here at work

485
00:24:55.660 --> 00:25:00.700
and, you know, move forward
with them through this, through

486
00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:04.900
this medium, you know, we're
all windows, ASP, net C

487
00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:08.260
sharp developers here too. So
again, it was the same

488
00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:10.660
barrier to entry here at
the corporate level that I

489
00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:13.180
had personally, and that we
don't have anybody who knows,

490
00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:16.960
you know, objective C or
these other things. So that's

491
00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:18.670
why we never got into
it. But now this is

492
00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:22.150
an Avenue to help us
break into that. And was

493
00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:24.550
this as a result of
you taking your moonlighting project

494
00:25:24.550 --> 00:25:26.230
and saying, Hey, look at
this. And they said, Oh

495
00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:28.450
wow, this is great. Or
did you just say phone

496
00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:32.500
gap is cool? No, that's
exactly how it was. Is

497
00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:34.420
we kind of all sat
around the table and said,

498
00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:37.060
Hey, here's how it works.
And here's what you get.

499
00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:39.460
And here's what you can
do. And this makes sense.

500
00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:42.550
And I think everybody agrees
in a 10. Do you

501
00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:44.590
have a sense of what
kinds of applications would be

502
00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:51.160
good for phone gap and
what kinds would not? You

503
00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:52.570
know, there's, I'm sure there's
people out there who are

504
00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:55.060
going to produce games for
it. And maybe HTML five

505
00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:58.030
style games are good for
it, but I'm not sure

506
00:25:58.030 --> 00:26:01.900
hardcore angry birds kinds of
apps would be great on

507
00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:04.360
phone gap. You'd probably want,
you know, things that are

508
00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:06.970
very graphic intensive. You'd probably
want to get as close

509
00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:10.420
to the metal as you
can, but you know, things

510
00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:15.190
like navigational interacting with data
apps like I have, you

511
00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:17.290
know, I thought it worked
great. I didn't really have

512
00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:21.490
any issues with that side
of it. Now, what kind

513
00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:25.630
of phone do you have
personally? IPhone four. And have

514
00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:29.260
you downloaded any applications on
the iPhone and discovered later

515
00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:35.710
that they were phone gap
applications? I have not. I

516
00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:38.530
have not. So I wonder
if there's no way for

517
00:26:38.530 --> 00:26:42.520
you to discover that. I
guess I think some gap

518
00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:45.810
has a on their site
from gap.com of some of

519
00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:48.840
the things that are, that
are apps that are out

520
00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:51.180
there. And I guess that
would be just about the

521
00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:53.510
only way you could, you
could, I guess, I guess

522
00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:55.970
what I'm wondering is that,
I mean, I pay attention

523
00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:57.710
to this kind of stuff.
I'm sure you pay attention

524
00:26:57.710 --> 00:27:01.670
to this kind of stuff.
If you could you notice

525
00:27:01.670 --> 00:27:05.360
an application and go, Hey,
that doesn't feel right. Like

526
00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:08.900
I know that my bank
first technology credit union has

527
00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:13.280
just a horrible, horrible mobile
application. It's just awful. And

528
00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:16.280
basically all they did was
they took their existing mobile

529
00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:18.290
site and edit a toolbar
and then called it an

530
00:27:18.290 --> 00:27:21.500
app. And it was, it's
not phone gap. It's just

531
00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:24.710
garbage. Right. I've, I've seen
that quite a bit. And

532
00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:27.500
that was something I've kind
of wanted to stray away

533
00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:31.310
from because it's obviously just,
you know, a repackaging of

534
00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:34.940
what they sat out there
and it's not necessarily native

535
00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:40.220
for the device, but in
terms of, you know, bloating

536
00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:41.740
up an app and going,
Hey, this must've been on

537
00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:45.920
a phone gap. I, I
haven't seen anything. But the

538
00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:49.610
one thing I would say
about phone gap performance is,

539
00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:54.590
you know, interestingly, when you're
working with debugged versions of

540
00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:57.050
your app, you know, you
have something built out in

541
00:27:57.050 --> 00:27:59.150
the cloud and then you
install it on your and

542
00:27:59.150 --> 00:28:03.080
your development. So, you know,
just like any debug build

543
00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:07.370
the things it's pretty slow,
you know, and, you know,

544
00:28:07.370 --> 00:28:08.990
giving them all the benefit
of the doubt. I am,

545
00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:12.290
I am kind of debugging
iPhone three. So it's not

546
00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:16.130
the fastest thing in the
world, but it's amazing to

547
00:28:16.130 --> 00:28:17.810
me how once you do
a release build and you

548
00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:20.060
get that actually installed through
the app store, how much

549
00:28:20.090 --> 00:28:23.210
faster it seems. So, So
you really are at the

550
00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:26.480
limit of whatever the browser
can do. You are. And

551
00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:29.150
I guess my other point
is, is don't let you

552
00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:31.970
know some of the slowness
you may see in the

553
00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:35.510
debug build kind of let
you stray away from the

554
00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:37.970
platform because it's been my
experience that when you get

555
00:28:37.970 --> 00:28:39.950
a release build up and
out, I think performance much

556
00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:45.020
better. Interesting. Interesting. Well, I
gotta check this out. I

557
00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:46.670
wonder if this is going
to take off or this

558
00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:49.040
will always be a niche
because I think that I'm

559
00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:50.840
going to have to have
the guys from mano touch

560
00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:56.120
on later because there's so
many different ways to do

561
00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:57.920
this. Right. You could do
it in HTML five and

562
00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:00.500
do the phone gap thing.
Right. You could write it

563
00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:04.790
natively or you could use
kind of an intermediary kind

564
00:29:04.790 --> 00:29:07.880
of thing, like motto, touch
where they're, they're, they're kind

565
00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:10.790
of compiling to native code,
but they're making it just

566
00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:12.950
so smooth from that from
the front end, had you

567
00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:14.750
looked at mano touch or
thought about that when you

568
00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:18.350
were going to go write
your application Just briefly. I

569
00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:20.090
didn't spend a lot of
time looking at it. I

570
00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:24.410
just found this and it
just sort of made sense

571
00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:27.890
when I started looking so
Very cool. Very cool. Well,

572
00:29:27.890 --> 00:29:33.320
people can check that out@phonegap.com
and if there's any Eagle

573
00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:37.280
Scouts, they can check it
that out@atrailtoeagle.com. We'll put links

574
00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:39.290
to both of those at
the, in the show notes.

575
00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:41.980
This is good to know
that this out there I

576
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:43.510
got to think about, I
don't think that it's good

577
00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:47.140
for my screen, my photo
editor application, like you said,

578
00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:48.790
but it sounds like if
you were going to make

579
00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:53.200
like a conference browser or
for, you know, for a

580
00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:57.370
technical conference or a database
of information, or even even

581
00:29:57.370 --> 00:30:01.150
a calculator or an application
for gosh, there's a million

582
00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:02.440
different, sorry. My brain is
trying to think of a

583
00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:05.080
million things I could do,
right? Yeah, you're right. I

584
00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:08.500
mean, if you're going to
be entering and browsing and

585
00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:10.660
moving around data forward and
backward, you can pretty much

586
00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:13.420
do anything in, in HTML.
I think I'm going to

587
00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:15.520
give this a try and
see. Maybe I could make

588
00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:17.350
a nerd dinner, phone gap
application. You want to try

589
00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:21.420
that? Maybe sounds like a
great idea. Yeah, let's let,

590
00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:23.950
let's try that. Very cool.
Well, thanks Pete. I really

591
00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:26.440
appreciate you coming on the
show. Thanks for having me.

592
00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:31.150
This has been another episode
of Hansel minutes and we'll

593
00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:32.320
see you again next week.
