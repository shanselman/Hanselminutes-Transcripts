00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.950
This is Lawrence Ryan announcing show
number four 74. In this

10
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.700
episode, Scott talks with dr.
Sue black about saving the

11
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:08.940
historic Bletchley park. Hi, this
is Scott Hanselman. This is

12
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.790
another episode of Hansel minutes,
and today we have the

13
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.400
pleasure of talking with dr.
Sue black. Thank you so

14
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.000
much for taking the time.
Hi, thanks very much for

15
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.810
talking to me. I learned
about you, not because of

16
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.210
all of your other great
work that you have done,

17
00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.720
but specifically about Bletchley park,
because I went and saw

18
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.980
the movie, the imitation game
and was really struck by

19
00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.760
the story and then tweeted
about it. And then through

20
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.480
a number of kind of
great tweets found out that

21
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.090
the movie that I saw
is in no way a

22
00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:47.350
documentary. True. True. Yeah. I
mean, isn't that amazing? The

23
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.910
great power of Twitter I'd
have to say straight off

24
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.560
that I absolutely love Twitter
and Twitter was absolutely fundamental

25
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.480
in the stuff that we
did in trying to save

26
00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:02.450
Bletchley park. So yeah. Which
cool. Yeah. I was one

27
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.070
of those things where we
would, you and I would

28
00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.680
tweet each other and then
people that we've each knew

29
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.350
would say, you guys did,
did you know each other?

30
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.720
Oh, you know, it seems
like a little cocktail party

31
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.720
where people get to meet
and people get to listen

32
00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.870
in on other people's conversations.
Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I think,

33
00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.730
yeah, I think of Twitch
was like a big party

34
00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.610
and yeah. And, but you
can listen it on everybody's

35
00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.340
conversations. Right. So that's so
cool. And it was really

36
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.350
cool because I didn't know
you and you didn't know

37
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.080
me, but loads of people
knew both of us. So

38
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.080
yeah. I thought that was
great. Yeah, it's fantastic. So

39
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.400
this movie, the imitation game
is a drama to station

40
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.700
a and it has Benedict
Cumberbatch and it talks about

41
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.060
Alan Turing and the work
that was done, not just

42
00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.690
by him, but by many,
many people to solve the

43
00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.870
enigma. Can you talk about
why this, you know, what

44
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.070
this movie expresses and why
it's problematic? Well, I guess,

45
00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.090
I mean, my review basically
stated that I both loved

46
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.090
it and I hated it
at the same time, the

47
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.270
film, and I guess I'll,
I'll start with the reasons

48
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.140
I hated it. And that
was just because it told

49
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.740
the story in a very
kind of simplistic way. It

50
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.110
got lots of facts wrong.
It kind of, it was

51
00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.340
a, it was a bit
clunky in parts where, for

52
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.120
example, like the guy who
was cheering, his boss in

53
00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.300
the film was portrayed as
this kind of like kind

54
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.400
of evil guy, you know,
it's like, yeah, you must

55
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.010
have an evil guy in
a film. Right. Who's, who's

56
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.920
kind of, they're doing, doing
bad things. Whereas in fact,

57
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.940
his boss was great, you
know, and surely the evil

58
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.820
guy should have been Hitler,
not, not cheering his boss

59
00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.270
who was trying to, you
know, help, help win the

60
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.820
war and save lives. So
it was a bit clunky

61
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.440
and kind of a bit,
you know, grated a bit,

62
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.220
I suppose, and especially having
met some of the people,

63
00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.060
relatives of the people involved.
So in particular, this guy

64
00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.340
who was Turing's boss, I've
met his grandson. And so,

65
00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.190
you know, I know that
his family were really upset

66
00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.700
about the portrayal of, of
their grandad in the film.

67
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.380
And, you know, so this
guy that was a hero

68
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.570
is portrayed in the film
as a villain. And it

69
00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.910
just, there's just lots of,
you know, bits and pieces

70
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.840
like that, which just, weren't
true. And surely that the

71
00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.870
real story is, is good
enough on its own. Why,

72
00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.830
why did you have to
change it like that? So,

73
00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.260
so that, that was kind
of, there were several negative

74
00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.440
things like that. And the
kind of everything was obviously

75
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.800
touring was amazing, but it's
like every major achievement was

76
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.990
kind of made out that
cheering made every single major

77
00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.680
achievement at Bletchley park. Whereas
there were 10,000 people working

78
00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.830
there and also most of
the people that work there

79
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.690
were women. And so that
wasn't really portrayed in the

80
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.310
film. So I could go
on and on and on,

81
00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.460
But I'd like you to
go on and on and

82
00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.610
on. That's why you're on
the show. Okay, cool. Well

83
00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.830
maybe we can talk for
people who aren't familiar, but

84
00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.830
what is important about the
enigma and the Lauryn ciphers

85
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.870
and what was so important
about the government code and

86
00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.620
cipher school? Well, so basically,
but actually park was set

87
00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.890
up to break the German
codes. And so enigma under

88
00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:03.960
owns with two of the
machines that the Germans used

89
00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.580
and yeah, Bletchley park was
set up there with the

90
00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.410
kind of the highest point
with about 10,000 people working

91
00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.100
there, all working together to
crack the codes. And, you

92
00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.380
know, it was one of
the major achievements of the

93
00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.110
second world war, but everyone
there was completely sworn to

94
00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.800
secrecy. And in fact, they
were kind of not exactly

95
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.990
threatened, but they were kind
of shown somebody with a

96
00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.230
gun who would shoot them
if they told anybody what

97
00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.900
was happening and they had
to sign the official secrets

98
00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.600
act. And it was, you
know, like I was saying

99
00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.140
before, it was mainly women
and most of the code

100
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.180
breakers were men, but it
was like a big kind

101
00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:47.100
of industrialized code breaking process.
And most of the people

102
00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.430
running those machines, which were
the, like the bomb machine

103
00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.540
and Colossus, which were there
as the code breaking machines,

104
00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.320
most of those machines were
run by all those women

105
00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.710
and the women actually, where
we're almost girls, because most

106
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.410
of them were about 1820.
So they, you know, they

107
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:06.980
were very young women. And
so, you know, the, the

108
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.710
film didn't get any of
that across at all. And

109
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:13.700
I suppose, you know, why
should the film portray everything

110
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.690
exactly as it was? But
I think it's, it's important

111
00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:20.360
to tell that story, especially
when it hasn't really been

112
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.750
told before, you know, if
we'd seen lots of films

113
00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.420
about that, we're much more
truthful about what had gone

114
00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:29.030
on before we would already
know the true story, but

115
00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:32.600
because this is like the
first major film about what

116
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.240
happens at Bletchley park, really
there is the film in

117
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:39.260
mode, but that wasn't really
true to life either. So

118
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:41.600
because it's the first major
firm, it started a massive

119
00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.990
opportunity to tell this amazing
story. But what it actually

120
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.150
did was told a story
that was a bit like

121
00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:50.480
the truth, but not really,
and kind of just made

122
00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:53.840
it much too simple and
didn't really give credit to

123
00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.750
lots of the people that
really helped. And, you know,

124
00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.660
so kind of, you know,
you get annoyed about that

125
00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:02.110
stuff. If you know, the
true story And a movie

126
00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:04.600
comes out about a particular
topic like this, it's an

127
00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.630
opportunity. And it's also a
moment in time where there's

128
00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:10.450
not going to be another
Leslie park, a nickname movie

129
00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:13.450
for some number of years
until someone does it again.

130
00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:16.330
And it's really important. I
think for listeners to know

131
00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:19.360
that it's not just that,
Oh yeah, well, there are

132
00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:22.140
some women involved and the
women didn't get, get, get

133
00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:28.330
accredited. 80% of the people
working there, plus thousands, 9,000

134
00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:31.960
women. This isn't like 50,
50 or 90 10, I

135
00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.990
mean, 80 plus percent. It
was mostly women doing this

136
00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:38.590
work. And in the film,
there was largely one woman,

137
00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:44.950
Joan Clark played by Keira Knightley
who was presented Really. So,

138
00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:46.780
you know, you can see
why anyone that knows the

139
00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:48.820
story would get, would get
a bit annoyed about that.

140
00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:51.730
But say what I said
in my review was that,

141
00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:53.950
so for those reasons I
hated it, but at the

142
00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:57.220
same time, of course, I
absolutely loved it because, you

143
00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:59.860
know, they're on the big
screen with, you know, top

144
00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:04.960
actors up there for Oscars
is this major film, which

145
00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.600
tells some of the story
of what happens at Bletchley

146
00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.760
park. So of course I
loved it for that reason,

147
00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:12.130
you know, because it's really
getting the message out there

148
00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.800
to an audience. Most of
whom won't really have known

149
00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.830
what did happen there. And
so even just getting the

150
00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:20.650
name Bletchley park out there,
well, I want to, well,

151
00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:23.500
I know that it did
it, it increased the number

152
00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:27.010
of visitors going up to
Bletchley park, but you know,

153
00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:30.010
quite dramatically. So, you know,
it's great that it's done

154
00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:31.750
that, but at the same
time, that's kind of fun

155
00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.910
that with all these things
that you know is a

156
00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:36.580
good story, why change it?
And so you say that

157
00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:38.590
it has changed the number
of visitors. I mean, I

158
00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:41.080
know that I was familiar
with Leslie park, but now

159
00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:43.570
after seeing it, it makes
me want to go there

160
00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:47.200
and actually stand there. And
I think that's the really,

161
00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.080
that's the great sort of
longterm thing that the film

162
00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:55.950
will do Was cryptography. And
please forgive my ignorance, but

163
00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:57.300
this is why I had
you on the show. Was

164
00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.940
it a really well understood
thing in the, in the

165
00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:03.410
late thirties, early forties? Well,
gosh, that's a good question.

166
00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:05.390
I don't actually know the
answer to that. I mean,

167
00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:08.210
I think the people that
they got up there from,

168
00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:11.960
you know, the major UK
universities, so some people were

169
00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:17.120
experts in cryptography. Other people
were experts in languages, of

170
00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:22.340
course, like Japanese German. So
I'm not an expert at

171
00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:25.880
wartime cryptography, I'm afraid, but
if you want me to

172
00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:27.770
find someone to come on
your show next time, then

173
00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:29.930
I'll find them for you.
That would be a fine

174
00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:35.210
idea. I, I think that
the mythos, the mythology of,

175
00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:40.400
of touring and why the,
the movie changed the story,

176
00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.860
you know, as a piece
of fiction is really interesting

177
00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:47.240
because certainly he was persecuted
based on his lifestyle and

178
00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:51.470
reason then of course recently
given a formal apology. But

179
00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:55.940
do you think it was
because he was a singular

180
00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:58.490
man that they decided to
make the entire focus on

181
00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:00.530
him and erase the rest
of the other people? Or

182
00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:03.020
would you think it was
because of the persecution? Why

183
00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:04.910
is it we are so
obsessed with touring that we

184
00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:07.730
would give him the credit
of the work of 12,000

185
00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:10.940
plus people? Well, I think
he's more widely known than

186
00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:13.370
any of the other code
breakers to start with. So

187
00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:17.870
there's that, I think also
for some reason, we kind

188
00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:19.940
of get a bit obsessed
with people who die young

189
00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:24.710
and also just the whole
kind of like heart wrenching,

190
00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:28.220
his, his whole story. You
know, you, you can just

191
00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:32.570
imagine this, this guy who
was phenomenally clever, who most

192
00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:36.500
people didn't really understand, but
I mean, I think he

193
00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:39.710
was respected Bletchley park, but
you know, it's kind of

194
00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:42.440
outside of that kind of
world that maybe he wasn't

195
00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:45.140
so much. And, and that's
where, you know, like the

196
00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:48.740
police, the police getting involved
and all of that and

197
00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:51.410
just, just how everything was
in those times. It's just,

198
00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:53.930
it's just horrendous. Isn't it
to us today to think

199
00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:56.750
that that's actually not really
that long ago that people

200
00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:59.180
were treated like that. I
mean, I find it disgusting

201
00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:02.840
really, but just his whole
kind of story, you know,

202
00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:05.840
this poor guy who, you
know, had basically had a

203
00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:07.700
brain, the size of a
planet, it was really, really

204
00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:10.790
smart, really tried hard to
do the best for his

205
00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:14.480
country. You know, he, he
was just like, I dunno,

206
00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:17.330
like a, almost like a
superhero kind of guy. So

207
00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:20.150
of course, everyone kind of
that resonates with everybody, but

208
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:23.030
at the same time he
was treated so badly and

209
00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:26.690
then, you know, ended up
dying at a young age.

210
00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:29.270
It's just like, you know,
that's kind of the story

211
00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:32.390
is that films are films
and books are written about

212
00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:34.880
and films are made about,
because it's just so kind

213
00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:39.470
of tragic, I guess It's
an, it's an easy plot

214
00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:42.560
foil to just say, ah,
the hero, the antihero, the

215
00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.660
protagonist, we found them, and
then you just wrap the

216
00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:48.890
entire story. Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
Yeah. So, so I mean,

217
00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:51.950
but hopefully another thing that
it'll do is it'll make

218
00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:54.820
people aware of fact that
there is more to the

219
00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:58.570
story. There were lots of
other Codebreakers there, lots of

220
00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:00.790
other stuff happens. And so,
you know, what I'm really

221
00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:03.370
hoping is that as time
goes on, other films will

222
00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:05.920
be made, which look at
different aspects. So for example,

223
00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:09.520
I first got involved with
Bletchley park in 2003. And

224
00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:12.610
that was when I went
up there for a meeting

225
00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:16.150
and, and found out on
that day that actually 10,000

226
00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:17.920
people work there and that
more than half of them

227
00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:20.140
were women and that's how
I got involved. And so

228
00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:24.310
I then was looking around
for funding to try and

229
00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:27.310
fund an oral history project
for the women that work

230
00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:31.060
there because being a woman
working in technology for 20

231
00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:33.790
years, I had no clue
that any women worked at

232
00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:36.220
Bletchley park at all, you
know, so that story just

233
00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:38.680
had not been told. And
so my, my first involvement

234
00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:41.740
really was trying to highlight
the contribution of the women

235
00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:43.870
and that, you know, that
started kind of coming out

236
00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:46.450
more and more they're about
three books come out recently

237
00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:48.820
about the women that worked
at Bletchley park. So I

238
00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:51.460
think these things just take
time, you know, you, you

239
00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:53.860
want start, I always want
stuff to happen really quickly,

240
00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:56.500
but in actuality, you know,
it all takes a long

241
00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:59.850
time for it all to
happen. And one of the

242
00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:02.910
things also is that there
were so many women who

243
00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:07.080
worked on this whose work
was classified by the official

244
00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:11.220
secrets acts in 1939. So,
you know, Margaret rock died

245
00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:14.250
in 1983, but no one
really knew what she'd done

246
00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:17.310
until that information was declassified.
You know, when she was

247
00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:20.340
an old person. Yeah, yeah,
absolutely. And some people died,

248
00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:24.510
you know, like Tommy flowers
who invented Colossus, you know,

249
00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:28.890
to break Lorens. So he,
I think not really in

250
00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:31.380
his whole lifetime, did he
get properly recognized for the

251
00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:33.750
stuff that he'd done? And
then someone told me a

252
00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:38.220
story of how he, I
think in the seventies, signed

253
00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:40.650
up for a class to
learn how to use a

254
00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:44.460
computer. And it's like, he
bloody invented the computer, but

255
00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:46.260
you know, he signed up
for a class to learn

256
00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:50.490
how to use the computer.
And yeah, I can't remember

257
00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:53.430
exactly what was said, but
it was just like quite

258
00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:55.860
patchy ionizing the way that
he was talked to there,

259
00:13:55.870 --> 00:14:00.150
because of course, no one
knew that he'd invented the

260
00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:03.810
first program of digital computer
because that had been done,

261
00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:07.590
you know, like a seventies,
30 years before. And it

262
00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:09.870
was still secret. So, you
know, and there are just

263
00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:12.480
so many stories like that,
of people that have made

264
00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:15.330
major contributions, but never been
able to talk about it.

265
00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:18.210
And so the ones that
are still around now can

266
00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:21.150
talk about it, but of
course, loads of people died

267
00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:26.280
before, before that was lifted.
I want to take a

268
00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:30.090
moment to thank our sponsors,
sync, fusion, sync fusions, mobile

269
00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:33.510
web, and desktop controls are
trusted worldwide, but did you

270
00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:38.040
know that they also provide
educational resources? The succinctly series

276
00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:08.120
their library@syncfusion.com to download your
free ebook today. One of

277
00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:10.280
the things that I was
surprised about was not just

278
00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:14.030
the, the, the gender aspects,
but also the, the distances

279
00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:17.300
in ages. You had different
women code breakers at Bletchley

280
00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:21.740
park. Joan Clark came out with
a double degree in mathematics

281
00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:24.740
and like 23, I think
when she came to pledge

282
00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:29.690
the park, well, Margaret rock,
another women coat, a woman

283
00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:32.720
Codebreakers showed up around her
37th birthday. So we had

284
00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:37.100
a very wide range of
experiences, a wide range of

285
00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:40.700
degrees. A lot of them
in mathematics, all working towards

286
00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:43.810
towards one thing. Yeah, absolutely.
I think one of the

287
00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:48.700
kind of great things about
Bletchley park was that because

288
00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:53.440
there was such a massive
threat from Hitler and, you

289
00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:56.440
know, just from the country
being at war, everyone pulled

290
00:15:56.440 --> 00:16:00.820
together and, you know, everyone
was just desperate to find

291
00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:03.490
the best people to do
stuff. And so in a

292
00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:06.130
way it wouldn't really matter
who anybody was, they just

293
00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:08.620
wanted the best people to
do it. And I suppose

294
00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:10.960
that's why it kind of
brought together a sort of

295
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.810
a mixed group of people,
I suppose, to make that

296
00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:17.950
happen. That mix of people,
they all had different skills.

297
00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:21.910
One of the funny things
about Joan Clark was that she

298
00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:25.570
was promoted to the rank
of linguist, but in fact

299
00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:29.830
had no scale in languages
and would fill out questionnaires

300
00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:34.310
and say, you know, pay
grade linguist languages, none. She

301
00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:37.540
was a mathematician were, were,
were her bosses trying to

302
00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:39.850
give her power, but were
having to work within a

303
00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:42.070
power structure that did not
allow a woman to be.

304
00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:45.550
Yeah, I'm guessing. So, yeah.
I mean, I've heard that

305
00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:47.890
story and I can't remember
exactly, but I'm guessing that

306
00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:49.540
it is that kind of
thing, that it just was

307
00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:51.850
impossible to do it any
other way. Yeah. Yeah. She

308
00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:55.570
was promoted to deputy head
of hut eight in 1944

309
00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:58.420
and was the only woman
at Leslie Parker reached that

310
00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:03.430
senior level from a cryptographic
perspective. Yeah. It's absolutely amazing.

311
00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:07.630
So you are actively working
on making sure that Bletchley

312
00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:10.720
park does not get forgotten
and you use, you're trying

313
00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:13.960
to use social media to
do this. Sure. Well, so

314
00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:16.240
basically, as I was saying
before, like I went there

315
00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:20.320
the first time in 2003
came away, having found out

316
00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:22.960
that more than 10,000 people
work there. And also the

317
00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:25.000
more than half of them
were women wanting to raise,

318
00:17:25.090 --> 00:17:29.440
raise the profile of those
women, find out more really

319
00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:33.300
about what happened and at
the launch of, so, so

320
00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:35.350
we run this project, the
women of station X. And

321
00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:37.600
so another name for Bletchley
park is station X. Cause

322
00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:40.810
it was the 10th listening
station as part of the

323
00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:47.230
code breaking effort. So we
got some funding, we interviewed

324
00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:50.370
some women that work there.
And then at the launch

325
00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:53.790
of our project in 2008,
I'm the director of Bletchley

326
00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:56.730
park at the time Simon
greenish gave a talk and

327
00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:59.970
he said that they were,
were, his words were, they

328
00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:02.670
were teaching on a financial
knife edge. So he wasn't

329
00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:06.150
sure if they would be
able to stay open. And

330
00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:08.010
so I kind of, you
know, we had to launch

331
00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:10.080
and it was all great
of this project, but I

332
00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:12.870
kind of went home thinking,
well, that's not right. Why

333
00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:15.600
have they not got enough
money? And then like a

334
00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:17.670
few weeks later I was
invited up to Bletchley parts

335
00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:20.400
where reception, and then I
did a full tour, which

336
00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:23.520
I've not done before because
it's like, it's a 26

337
00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.020
acre site. So I think
so, you know, it's a

338
00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:27.360
big site with lots of
hearts, the munchkin house, a

339
00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:31.770
Lake. And so it did
a proper tour around where

340
00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:34.200
the veteran who'd worked there
telling us all about what

341
00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:37.140
he'd done and stories of
other people and just, it

342
00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:41.100
was really just so, so
interesting. And I kind of

343
00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:45.570
had this moment where I
was standing, looking at hot

344
00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:47.730
sex, which at the time
was kind of covered at

345
00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:50.850
one end with a blue
tarpaulin because there was, you

346
00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:55.530
know, to stop water leaking
cause the roof had holes

347
00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:58.170
in it. So looking at
this heart's and the veteran

348
00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:00.750
was telling us about the
major code breaking achievements that

349
00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:04.830
happened in that heart. And,
and I just thought back

350
00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:07.050
to what Simon greenish had
said about them not having

351
00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:09.090
enough money. And I just
thought, this is ridiculous. All

352
00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:12.720
these major code breaking achievements
and the works on their

353
00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:16.110
sets were shortened the war
by two years. And it's

354
00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:19.770
like, you know, it's a
really fundamental place in terms

355
00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:24.450
of computer science with, with
cheering, working there being sort

356
00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:27.450
of the father of computer
science. And I just thought

357
00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:30.000
on this place might close.
That's ridiculous. You know, I've

358
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.130
got to do something about
it. So I went away

359
00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:34.350
basically. And at that time
I was head of a

360
00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:37.860
computer science department at the
university of Westminster in London.

361
00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:41.940
And so I basically emailed
all the heads and professor

362
00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:47.100
of computing in the UK
and said, you know, this

363
00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:50.160
is a disgrace at the
time, there was a petition

364
00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:54.660
on the 10 Downing street
website, the prime ministers office,

365
00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:57.120
which someone else had set
up saying, we must say

366
00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:59.070
Bletchley park. And so I
pointed all the heads and

367
00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:02.400
professors at this petition and
said, you know, please sign

368
00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:05.070
the petition. We've got to
save Bletchley park. So I

369
00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:06.570
send that email out. It
was quite a new head

370
00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:08.730
of department. So I was
a bit scared actually that

371
00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:10.230
they would come back and
say, who do you think

372
00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:13.380
you are? Because that's probably
a bit in post, like

373
00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:16.620
six months or something, but
actually it was great. So

374
00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:19.080
I looked at the petition
a few hours later, loads

375
00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:21.840
of like, to me, famous
heads and professors of computing

376
00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:24.300
from around the UK people
whose textbooks I'd use as

377
00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:27.270
a student had signed the
petition. So I thought, okay,

378
00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:29.250
it's not just me. That
feels like this. Lots of

379
00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:31.890
other people do too. And
you know, lots of my

380
00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:37.140
peers. So then I and
a colleague at university of

381
00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:39.630
Westminster wrote a letter to
the times and sent that

382
00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:41.550
round, asking all these heads
and profs to sign the

383
00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:43.650
letter to the times. So
then that went into the

384
00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:48.460
times. And at the same
time I contacted the BBC

385
00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:50.650
and said, you know, I
think I've got a story.

386
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:54.760
And so basically what happened
was we ended up on

387
00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.560
the BBC news and in
the times newspaper with the

388
00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:01.030
rest of the times on
the same day. So that

389
00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:03.970
was in 2008 and that
kind of went, that went

390
00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:08.290
international. So that was really
cool. But what I realized

391
00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:10.900
after that was that something
that's news one day is

392
00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:13.960
not news the next day.
And you know, I'm not

393
00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:16.840
a PR person or advertising
or marketing or anything, you

394
00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:19.390
know, I'm a computer science
academic, right? So I don't

395
00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:22.600
really know what to do
next. And I suppose what

396
00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:25.510
happens a few months after
that was I started using

397
00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:28.240
Twitter and then realize quite
quickly that actually that was

398
00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:30.310
a very good way to
reach lots of people very

399
00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:33.730
quickly and five people that
were interested in Bletchley park.

400
00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:36.280
Cause even the simplest thing
is to put, you can

401
00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:38.500
put Bletchley park in and
find everyone who's tweeting about

402
00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:40.900
it. You know, so very
quickly you can find people,

403
00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:43.270
you can build up community,
you can talk to those

404
00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:47.530
people, you can make stuff
happen. And so basically then

405
00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:51.040
run a campaign, a campaign
using Twitter in the main

406
00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:57.610
to make people aware of
their situation and got various

407
00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:01.630
celebrities involved and ran a
campaign over about three years,

408
00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:08.070
really eventually getting Google involved,
Google helped out. And, and

409
00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:12.130
in 2011, the director said
that, but actually part was

410
00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:15.100
saved. So basically they, you
know, they were on an

411
00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:18.690
even keel financially. And do
you think it's sustainable now?

412
00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:25.230
Absolutely. So, and since then,
they've, they've got 4.1 million

413
00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:29.130
heritage lottery funding. So like
some substantial funding and they've

414
00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:33.180
renovated many of the hearts.
And so, you know, it's,

415
00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:35.760
it's, it was a cool
place to visit when it

416
00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:37.440
was kind of falling apart.
Cause it was a bit

417
00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:41.880
ramshackle, but now they they've
done lots of work and

418
00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:43.770
it's a, you know, some
really state of the arts

419
00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:46.770
and some great stuff there.
Like for example, walking into

420
00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:50.910
the hotware cheering used to
work, you walk into the

421
00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:55.950
rooms and they've got like
voices. So they've got kind

422
00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:58.440
of all Jessica voices, like
having a conversation about code

423
00:22:58.440 --> 00:22:59.940
breaking as you walk in
and then you sort of

424
00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:03.900
see images projected onto the
wall of people talking to

425
00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:06.930
each other. It's very kind
of like really evocative of

426
00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:08.730
the second world war. So
it really does give you

427
00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:11.400
that feeling that, Oh my
goodness. Yes. This was the

428
00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:13.650
place where it all happens.
It kind of, you know,

429
00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:18.390
since tingles down your spine,
That's amazing. Yeah. Touring worked

430
00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:23.460
in, in hut eight and
I've looking online. There's pictures

431
00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:29.160
of these huts 10 years
ago, 2004, 2005. And honestly

432
00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:36.420
it looks like a poorly
maintained children's summer camp. You

433
00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:37.890
know what I mean? It
just looks like, it looks

434
00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:40.950
like your uncle's bad garage,
you know, that building that's

435
00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:44.010
out back that just needs
to be knocked down. Yeah,

436
00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:45.920
exactly. So when I, when
I talked to the BBC,

437
00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:47.990
I remember saying it looked
like a garden shed that

438
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:50.720
hadn't been looked after. So
maybe that's the English equivalent.

439
00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:55.930
Absolutely. But now you've got
big prominent signs that express

440
00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:59.830
express, you know, what the
significance of each building is

441
00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:03.010
and why they're important. And
they've even got the bar

442
00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:05.410
and restaurant next to the
mansion and it is a

443
00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:07.840
proper museum. And when we
can go and visit, Yeah,

444
00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:09.850
absolutely. I mean, it has
been, it's been open the

445
00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:12.730
whole time, but I think
as, as time goes on,

446
00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:15.100
it becomes more and more
like a proper national museum.

447
00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:19.360
The, the, the, if people
should do this and I'll

448
00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:21.580
put links in the show
notes, but you should look

449
00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:25.480
at the size of these
devices, like the F and

450
00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:31.750
is it pronounced? Yeah. The
silent, yeah. It's, it's, it's

451
00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:36.880
massive. I mean, it's multiple
refrigerators size a device here.

452
00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:40.610
And to think that I
can presume that the, the

453
00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:43.900
pocket supercomputer that I have
in my have next to

454
00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:47.050
me here, my iPhone is
literally many tens of thousands

455
00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:50.890
of times faster. Yeah, yeah,
absolutely. Yeah. They just look

456
00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:52.720
amazing. And actually the first,
so the first time I

457
00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:55.360
went, that's what I saw
that really got me very

458
00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:59.650
excited was about 10 guys
working away, halfway through rebuilding

459
00:24:59.650 --> 00:25:02.050
the bond machine because all
the machines were destroyed at

460
00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:05.230
the end of the war
and the plans were destroyed

461
00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:07.390
as well. So I think
it took them eight or

462
00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:10.600
10 years, like about 20
people to rebuild bomb machine.

463
00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:14.550
Yeah. And having to find
those parts or Yeah, yeah,

464
00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:17.860
yeah, absolutely. So they found
some and yeah, some had

465
00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:20.650
to be remade because of
the cause they've been a

466
00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:24.640
change from Imperial measurements to
metric in the UK, you

467
00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:27.970
know, in between the time
when the original one was

468
00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:33.550
built. So lots of parts,
they just didn't exist anymore.

469
00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:36.310
So we had to actually
have them made properly. That's

470
00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:39.250
amazing. And now you have
a fire understand quickly, a

471
00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:42.040
book coming out this spring
called saving Lesley park. How

472
00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:44.490
is that going? Yeah, that's
cool. Well, so I've, I've

473
00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:49.270
finished writing my part, so
which is cool and a

474
00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:52.210
release. Yeah. It shipped out
in July as the timing

475
00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:55.540
we're saying at the moment.
So that basically tells the

476
00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:58.710
story of the campaign. So
this kind of stuff that

477
00:25:58.710 --> 00:26:01.840
I've just been talking about,
that we did with the

478
00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:05.860
BBC, with Twitter, getting people
involved, it tells the story

479
00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:07.870
all the way through the
kind of adventures that I

480
00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:13.180
had along the way from
2003, 2008 up to the

481
00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:18.310
present day. And that's kind
of into, with the story

482
00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:21.610
of what happens at Bletchley
park during the war. So,

483
00:26:21.670 --> 00:26:25.150
you know, you kind of
get the two weaving in

484
00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:27.880
and out of each other,
telling the story. So starting

485
00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:30.820
at the beginning of the
war and people going up

486
00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:33.460
to Bletchley park is one
narrative. And the other narrative

487
00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:35.590
is me going up there,
you know, to start with

488
00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:38.050
and finding out about the
place. And so those two

489
00:26:38.050 --> 00:26:43.620
stories are woven together into
what, hopefully we'll make it

490
00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:46.290
very interesting book. Everyone that's
read it so far has

491
00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:50.630
said it's great. So yeah.
Fingers crossed. Do you have

492
00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:54.830
a favorite other book around
plus the park? Like, you

493
00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:58.370
know, there's certainly the 95
novel enigma by Robert Harris. It's

494
00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:00.800
a little more fictionalized. There's
a lot of different plays.

495
00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:03.170
What's your favorite that you
would recommend people go and

496
00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:07.760
learn about? It's not specifically
about Bletchley park, but there's

497
00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:12.740
a book called Colossus, which
is the people that actually

498
00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:15.770
worked there or worked on
projects to do with Colossus.

499
00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:19.670
Is there actual stories of
what they did and stuff?

500
00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:22.340
So I said, but maybe
coming from a computing background,

501
00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:26.450
I just love to actually
read people, write down what

502
00:27:26.450 --> 00:27:29.390
they did and what happened.
And it's really a collection

503
00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:34.460
of those kinds of accounts
all around Colossus. So yeah,

504
00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:37.820
that's probably my favorite And
that's the book by, by

505
00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:42.860
BJ Copeland. Right? So that's
the book is Colossus the

506
00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:45.800
secrets of blessedly parks code,
breaking computers. So this is

507
00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:50.060
a collection of kind of
told in a suspenseful tone,

508
00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:52.490
but with the real people
telling the stories about what

509
00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:54.890
really happened there when they
were yeah, Absolutely, yeah. What

510
00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:57.710
they did and how they
were involved and stuff. And

511
00:27:57.710 --> 00:27:59.390
is it, is it pretty
technical? Does it get into

512
00:27:59.390 --> 00:28:01.610
some of the details? I
think it's got some technical

513
00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:03.500
stuff in it, but I
think a general reader would

514
00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:07.610
be fine with it. Very
cool. That's fantastic. And what

515
00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:11.300
do you think that Americans
should think about Bletchley park?

516
00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:12.710
Cause I know that there's
a, there's a deep amount

517
00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:15.950
of passion from a UK
perspective and as a source

518
00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:20.330
of national pride, if I'm
in the UK or visiting,

519
00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:23.210
is this a must see
place for, for, even for

520
00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:30.170
an American, You know, I'm
biased, but yeah. Yeah, absolutely.

521
00:28:30.170 --> 00:28:32.630
I mean, I think it
was 300 Americans that, that

522
00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:34.940
did work at Bletchley park,
so it wasn't just British

523
00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:37.670
that were there. So there
were 300 Americans and there's

524
00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:44.090
a chapter in my book
about, so yeah. And well,

525
00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:46.580
I mean the thing is
it's, it's the story of

526
00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:49.310
the piece that we have
today, you know, peace in

527
00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:52.700
our time and you know,
the U S was very

528
00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:55.130
much a part of that
happening. So no, it's not

529
00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:57.140
just about Britain. It's about,
you know, all of us

530
00:28:57.290 --> 00:29:00.620
being able to live our
lives in freedom today. That's

531
00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:04.610
how I see it anyway.
Yeah. So calling back to

532
00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:08.510
the very beginning of the
conversation, we are understanding now

533
00:29:08.510 --> 00:29:11.720
that the movie was not
a really well well-represented of

534
00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:15.260
reality. And there was this,
this boss who was presented

535
00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:16.940
as really kind of the
bad guy in the film

536
00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:20.750
who was that gentleman Come
on to Dennison who was

537
00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:25.880
in charge of Bletchley park.
And yeah, he's portrayed in

538
00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:28.190
the film was a bit
of an ogre and like,

539
00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:31.310
you know, he's trying to
force cheering to, to finish

540
00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:33.770
working and he's going to
cut his funding if he

541
00:29:33.770 --> 00:29:37.400
doesn't get well, what's, what's
called Christopher in the film,

542
00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:40.760
which is actually the bond
machine. If he doesn't get

543
00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:44.110
that working in time. And,
and there's a lot of

544
00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:49.300
kind of toing and froing
and sort of angsting and

545
00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:52.690
stuff all around trying to
make that happen. Whereas actually,

546
00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:54.550
I don't think any of
that's true and commands a

547
00:29:54.550 --> 00:29:57.610
dentist and you know, was,
was not an OGA. He

548
00:29:57.610 --> 00:30:01.180
was a good boss in
charge of Bletchley park. So

549
00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:06.010
it seems a bit crazy
portraying him as a bad

550
00:30:06.010 --> 00:30:09.130
person when he's in charge
of the whole place. It

551
00:30:09.130 --> 00:30:12.510
doesn't make sense. He was
someone who was himself, a

552
00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:17.400
cryptographer recognized that code breaking
was important and consciously kept

553
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.640
code breaking through world war
one all the way up

554
00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:22.920
into world war II and
through world war II. While

555
00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:26.070
in the film, it seems
like he's begrudgingly allowing these

556
00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:29.100
guys to sit in a,
you know, like for people

557
00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:31.020
to sit in a hut
and work on code breaking

558
00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:34.910
Exactly when that's what they
were all there for. It

559
00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:38.190
makes sense. Yeah. The whole
point of this installation is

560
00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:40.200
to correct this code and
there's 12,000 of us here

561
00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:42.780
doing it, but it's four
people in a garage that

562
00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:48.060
saved the universe. Yeah. Yeah.
Well, hopefully people will familiarize

563
00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:53.700
themselves, not just with Alistair
Denniston with Joan Clark, with touring,

564
00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:56.490
but with all the great
stuff that happened at Bletchley

565
00:30:56.490 --> 00:30:59.880
park, there's lots of fiction
and nonfiction around the space.

566
00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:02.340
And I think it's important
for us as computers, people

567
00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:04.890
and computer scientists, to be
able to tell the difference

568
00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:08.200
between the truth and the
fiction. Yeah, absolutely. I are

569
00:31:08.210 --> 00:31:11.930
people like bill tarts and
Tommy flowers spring to mind,

570
00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:18.090
you've made absolutely major achievements
and starting to get a

571
00:31:18.090 --> 00:31:20.790
bit of recognition, but basically
most people have never heard

572
00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:24.090
of them still. Well, thanks
so much for chatting with

573
00:31:24.090 --> 00:31:28.080
me today. You're welcome. Well,
folks can check out dr.

574
00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:31.470
Sue black, online she's active
on Twitter and her book

575
00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:34.710
coming very, very soon is
saving Bletchley park. And I

576
00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:36.750
will include links in the
show notes to all of

577
00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:40.230
those things. That's wonderful. Thank
you so much. Absolutely. My

578
00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:44.250
pleasure. I really enjoyed talking
with you today. This has

579
00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:46.740
been another episode of Hanselminutes
and we'll see you again

580
00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:47.250
next week.
