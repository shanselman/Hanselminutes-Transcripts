00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.760
minutes, a weekly discussion with
web developer and technologist Scott

9
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.260
Hanselman. This is Lawrence Ryan announcing
show number four 70. In

10
00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.410
this episode, Scott talks with,
do you know <inaudible> creator

11
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:06.710
of OctoPrint. Hi, this is
Scott Hanselman. This is another

12
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.840
episode of Hansel minutes, and
I am talking with the

13
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.150
developer of OctoPrint Gina <inaudible>.
How are you? Hi, I'm

14
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.510
fine. Thank you. I am
absolutely thrilled to be talking

15
00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.060
to you because as people
who have been listening to

16
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.490
the show lately, no, I've
been getting into three D

17
00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.000
printing. And one of the
wonderful things that I discovered

18
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.880
as I was doing three
D printing, was that the

19
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.780
way I was talking to
my printer was more complicated

20
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.980
than it needed to be.
And fortunately, unlike other people

21
00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:42.140
who suffered for years before
they discovered OctoPrint, I discovered

22
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.720
it within just a few
hours of starting people said,

23
00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.130
Oh, you've got to get
OctoPrint. You got to get

24
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.740
out to print. What is
it about occupant that makes

25
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.250
it so special? Well, basically
it allows you to control

26
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.940
your three D printer, your
consumer oriented through your printer.

27
00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.770
I have to add from
a web browser. So you

28
00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.920
put the software on a
little embedded computer, like a

29
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.470
raspberry PI. You can also
use a laptop or a

30
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.720
windows machine or a Mac
or whatever you have laying

31
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.750
around, but the pie is
actually the intended use case

32
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.170
because it's so cheap. You
connect this to your respiratory

33
00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.700
pie, to your printer, and
then he on the other

34
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.840
end to your network. And
then you can basically use

35
00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.400
any web browser on your
local network. Or if you

36
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.250
add something like a portfolio
or something like that, even

37
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.540
from all over the world
to see what your printer

38
00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.900
is doing, to tell it
to print, file XYZ, whatever,

39
00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.850
to manipulate all the excess,
actually, you know, not only

40
00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.580
tell him what to do,
but also to see that

41
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.640
it does it right, because
with three D printers, right

42
00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.710
now, we are still not
at the point where they

43
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.740
are truly black and play.
Like, you know, the two

44
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.230
D printers that, you know,
from your office where you

45
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.360
tell them to print a
file and then they will

46
00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.700
just do it and everything
will be fine, but you

47
00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.710
still need this feedback loop.
So this is actually one

48
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.870
of the big focus points
of OctoPrint that the doc

49
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.690
does not handle the printer
as a black box, but

50
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.870
actually allows you to get
some feedback of what is

51
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.210
going on in there, Right?
With two D printing, you

52
00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.970
know, we feel confident I
can send a hundred pages

53
00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.100
to my printer and, you
know, as long as I

54
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.860
have paper and ink, I
don't really think about it.

55
00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.330
I'm not going to worry
that I'm going to come

56
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.240
back and find the house
on fire. I'm pretty sure

57
00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.370
that my two D printer
can handle this print job,

58
00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.180
but with three D printers
I've had, well, I made

59
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.550
one mistake where I simply
left the house and I

60
00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.920
came back and the print
had gone bad. And I

61
00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.730
found just a mess of
hot plastic. It was quite

62
00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.600
scary And it can be
quite scary to clean up

63
00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.470
too. Also, I've heard, thankfully
I so far never managed

64
00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.290
to end up with something
like that. Maybe thanks to

65
00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.890
OctoPrint. I don't know. It's
true. You definitely don't want

66
00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.400
to leave a three D
printer by itself. It can,

67
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.680
they can in fact, burn
your house down if it's,

68
00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.130
if it goes really, really,
really wrong, but your point

69
00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.760
about not leaving it on
'em unwatched is really an

70
00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.170
interesting one because these prints
will take eight hours, 12

71
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.150
hours. Even if you do
a big a year or

72
00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.800
more, if you do a
big print, what's the longest

73
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:21.210
print you've ever done. Personally,
I think I never got

74
00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.890
over six hours so far
because that's actually the funny

75
00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.160
thing about it. I got
that three D printer. Then

76
00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.400
I started writing software for
it. And all of a

77
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.590
sudden I was not actually
using the three D printer

78
00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.470
anymore for any long prints,
because I was so busy

79
00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.990
writing software and well, so
I think six hours, something

80
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:49.680
like that. And that was
overnight actually. So I've done.

81
00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.660
I I'm, I'm not a
patient I've done it. I've

82
00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.630
done a number of them
that are 10, 10 hours

83
00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.830
plus. And it's pretty amazing
that it worked. I felt

84
00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.390
like it was pretty amazing
that it worked at all,

85
00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.290
but I realized that I
wanted to see what was

86
00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:05.940
going on. And this was
what was so exciting to

87
00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.090
me about OctoPrint because it's
not just simply a, a

88
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.270
printer queue, right? I mean,
I plugged my three D

89
00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.760
printer originally into a laptop,
and then I realized I

90
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.550
don't want this laptop to
be tied up. But I

91
00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.120
also noticed that my, I
was getting printing issues because

92
00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.870
I'd be doing other stuff
on the laptop, you know,

93
00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.420
and then what would happen,
I would have buffering issues

94
00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.400
and it would stop talking
to the printer and things

95
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.440
would go wrong. You think
it's really important to have

96
00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:36.060
a dedicated computer that handles
your three D printing? Yeah,

97
00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.820
actually that was one of
the, one of the motivational

98
00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.190
points for me, because at
the beginning I had my

99
00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.800
printer here in my office.
It wasn't, it's a quite

100
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.290
big one. My first printer
was an Ultimaker the first

101
00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:49.380
generation. So that's not something
that you have just on

102
00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.100
your desktop. It's just too
big for that. And so

103
00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.440
it was standing around on
the floor with the cables

104
00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.210
going everywhere, the USB to,
to my, to my desktop

105
00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.800
PC, actually going some somehow
over my lap. And I

106
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.990
was not able to use
the printer at all while

107
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.500
it was printing. And that
was around the time when

108
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.050
I thought, okay, maybe there,
there has to be something

109
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.560
better than that. That, that
is just not usable that

110
00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.760
way. And how did this
start? Did you just write

111
00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.490
a prototype or had, did
anything like this exist before

112
00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:25.090
you decided to make OctoPrint
There exists, acquired a number,

113
00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:29.860
number of solutions that allows
you to basically remote control

114
00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:34.600
your printer, wire wire, your
wifi. And I think something

115
00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.670
like a week after I
got the printer, I started

116
00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:39.730
looking around the end in
the net four, four, something

117
00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:42.190
like that, but everything I
found handled the printer, like

118
00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:46.210
a black box. So basically
you had something like small

119
00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:49.610
web forms where you could
upload G-code files or the,

120
00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:54.070
the, the actual files that
the printer uses to in

121
00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:58.930
order to, to print stuff.
And there was that, so

122
00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:01.780
you could send stuff there,
but you did not know.

123
00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:04.510
Okay. Did it stop printing
now? Is it teasing out?

124
00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.690
Is the temperature at the,
at the point it's supposed

125
00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:09.790
to be, or is it,
I don't know, at 500

126
00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:13.960
degrees Celsius and the house
is on fire now And

127
00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:17.140
Yeah. And that was the
point where I thought, okay,

128
00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:21.550
maybe, maybe I should try
my hand at getting something

129
00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:24.820
so that I can work
with it. And that was

130
00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:28.840
right before my vacation, my
Christmas vacation breaks. So it

131
00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:32.710
was an EDL time. And
so I sat down and

132
00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:37.570
actually forked my, my, my
first iteration of, of Cura.

133
00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:41.590
So I used the communication
stack from Cura, which is

134
00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:45.040
in fact, a slicing engine,
but also has this component

135
00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:48.520
where it can connect to
your printer and actually sent

136
00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:53.200
the file over to it.
And yeah, that was the

137
00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:57.370
first iteration. And I think
after, after something like two

138
00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:59.800
days after Christmas or so
I was at a point

139
00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.290
where I said, Hey guys,
online on the, on the

140
00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:04.450
Google plus community for three
D printing, I said, Hey,

141
00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:07.780
I got something here and
it can plot your temperature

142
00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:10.720
and you can send files
over to it and it

143
00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:13.450
will then print them and
continuously upgrade you on the

144
00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:15.610
process. And you can use
it from all around the

145
00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:18.160
house and stuff. And people
were like, Oh, that's awesome.

146
00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.460
I want to use that
too. Where's the source. And

147
00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:24.100
then I uploaded it to
get up and made it,

148
00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.970
made it more usable over
the rest of my vacation,

149
00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:31.060
stripped Cura from it so
that it was a standalone

150
00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:35.800
product actually. And basically when
the new year turned around,

151
00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:40.030
that was a January, 2013, I
thought, okay, well, I'm done

152
00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:44.200
now. It was a fun,
right. I got a back,

153
00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:49.540
gotta get back to work
now, but people kept telling

154
00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:53.500
me it's awesome and asking
questions and demanding features and

155
00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.670
reporting backs, and suddenly had
a full blown, open source

156
00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:59.160
project on my hands, which
is suddenly not something I

157
00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:03.440
had planned on when I
started so well. Were you

158
00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.420
on vacation from a job
as a, as a web

159
00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:08.360
developer? Yeah, I actually know,
not as a web developer,

160
00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:12.530
I actually used to do
a full time Java development.

161
00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:15.260
So back and front and
also a bit, I also

162
00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.870
had some experience in web
development wise. I used to

163
00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:24.770
work for a big it
consultants company. And yeah, I

164
00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:29.630
also did so concurrently to
OctoPrint over the last couple

165
00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:33.830
of years until August last
year, when I was able

166
00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:37.820
to leave that You picked
the occupants written in Python

167
00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:42.200
primarily, correct? Yes. Yes. And
it pays in JavaScript of

168
00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:46.730
course, for front end stuff,
HTML, CSS. That's about it.

169
00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:48.650
Yeah. Were you using Python
in your job? Like, was

170
00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:51.080
it, did you try Python
because you thought, Hey, I

171
00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.180
do Java for a day
job. I'll do Python at

172
00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:58.040
night. I, it was more
like something I had done

173
00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:02.180
Python in my, I mean,
I always was somebody who

174
00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:07.040
liked to tinker with stuff.
So I also tried to

175
00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:09.710
make it a habit to
learn a new language every

176
00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:12.530
couple of years and pies.
And that had been the

177
00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:15.360
last language that I really
dabbled in back then. And

178
00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:19.610
then I think I learned
this in 2010, or I

179
00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:25.040
don't know, it's a long
time ago and Kira was

180
00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:27.140
written the pies. And so
that was one of the

181
00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:29.870
reasons why I used it.
I also understood it. I

182
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:32.710
really like that language because
it forces you to, to

183
00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:36.560
structure your code well, due
to white space, being significant

184
00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:39.270
compared to Java where you
can basically write lines, like,

185
00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:46.910
like, like from here to
New York and back, and, and

186
00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:51.080
yeah, and it's a quiet,
mature and quite powerful language.

187
00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:53.660
So I also took a
look at no JS at

188
00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:58.790
the beginning, but her, it
turns out that it was

189
00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:02.450
just not that mature yet.
So I actually ran into

190
00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:05.090
a lot of trouble and
I know people would probably

191
00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:08.090
flame me now for that,
but I actually develop on

192
00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:13.580
the windows and the no
JS support or getting no,

193
00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:17.270
Jay has to, to work
with serial ports under windows,

194
00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:24.080
at least around Christmas, 2012
was horrible. So I don't

195
00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:25.940
know. I think I spent
half a day on that

196
00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:28.310
and then decided, Oh, no,
I, I don't want to

197
00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:31.940
do this. I just go
with pies. And then, so

198
00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:35.050
I ended up with, And
this is Python 2.7. It's

199
00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:39.020
still pays Python 2.7. I
back when I started, it

200
00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:42.800
was, I use a couple
of, of, of frameworks and

201
00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:46.820
libraries inside. And I think
flask it, I'm not sure

202
00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:49.100
if it's now a flask
is the part that, that

203
00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:52.610
actually does the whole web
framework thing for me. And

204
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:58.030
I'm not sure about our
compatibility to 3.3 now, but

205
00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:01.030
at least back then they
still were restricted to five

206
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:05.190
and 2.7 or something. 2.7
is an extremely mature and

207
00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:07.920
extremely reliable cross platform thing.
So it is the, it

208
00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:10.140
is the Python that will
never die. So you shouldn't

209
00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:13.800
feel bad about using 2.7.
I'm not feeling bad about

210
00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:16.890
it. I just feel that,
you know, I would feel

211
00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:21.840
better if I work on
it. Yeah. Yeah. So we

212
00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:24.000
keep talking about serial ports.
Again, for people who may

213
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.720
not have context, you take
a three D model and

214
00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:31.500
STL that really true 3d
representation of the thing you

215
00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:34.410
want to print, and then
you slice it and you

216
00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:38.280
use, you mentioned Cura. Slicing
is the process of turning

217
00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:41.910
it from a three D
model into instructions for printing,

218
00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:45.810
which is just a text
file G code. And that

219
00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:48.960
G code is sent. Is
that sense, serially to the

220
00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:51.240
printer that like, you need
to like push it out.

221
00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.670
Like you talk to a
modem or any small shareholder.

222
00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:55.830
Yeah, Yeah. You have to,
you have to put it.

223
00:12:56.310 --> 00:13:00.450
You have actually, actually you
have two options, but in

224
00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:03.540
principle you, you just send
it line by line, by

225
00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:05.430
line, by line to the
printer and for each line,

226
00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:07.470
the printer tells you. Yeah.
Okay. I got that. Yeah.

227
00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:10.560
Okay. I got that. Or
not sometimes if you have

228
00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:12.890
some trouble on the line,
it will tell you, Oh

229
00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:15.960
no, I didn't get it.
Please send it again. And

230
00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.600
so you have to have
some intelligence in order to

231
00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:22.710
be able to handle those
recent requests. The other option

232
00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:25.350
of course, is some printers
or most printers these days

233
00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:29.580
actually also have the ability
to print directly from a

234
00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:32.400
Chico stored on an SD
card. So you take the

235
00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:34.260
G code file, put it
on the sticker, put the

236
00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.870
SD card in the printer.
And then on the printers,

237
00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:40.260
LC display or wire OctoPrint
because occupant also supports that

238
00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.840
you can then select the
file, say print. And then

239
00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:46.140
even if you disconnect the
laptop from the printer, it

240
00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:49.680
will continue to print. Ah,
that's, that's really the only

241
00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:51.330
reason I would want, I
was wondering why I would

242
00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:55.380
want to print from the
card so I could accidentally

243
00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:58.860
unhooked the thing Only that
you also avoid the bottleneck.

244
00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:02.400
That is the, that is
the serial port, because you

245
00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:05.970
are limited to 250,000 boat
or, or less than that

246
00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:10.890
demanded depending on the printer
model and all that. And

247
00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:15.450
depending on what you're trying
to print and how fast

248
00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:17.970
you're trying to print, that
can actually become an issue.

249
00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:22.230
Really. So, yeah. So if
you have something that, the

250
00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:25.500
thing is, if you instruct
a printer, a printer to

251
00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:28.860
print something, and if you're
instructed to print a circle,

252
00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:34.110
then what most slices or
really any slices I can

253
00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:37.050
think of right now will
produce for that cycle is

254
00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:40.320
not a, I don't know,
do a circle arc with

255
00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:44.520
four, four 90 degrees and
the radius of two centimeters,

256
00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:47.100
but instead do a little
line, then do a little,

257
00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:49.500
another, another little line then
to get another It's a

258
00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:53.900
bunch of little arc links
and a real, Real length.

259
00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:59.060
So line segments, line segments,
and line segments that are

260
00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:02.960
supposed to approximate a circle.
I mean, you can imagine

261
00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:07.010
how, how many short, very,
very short moves that will

262
00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:09.020
prove to produce. And for
each of those moves, you

263
00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:11.120
have one line that has
to go to the printer

264
00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:13.820
that has to be acknowledged
by the printer and so

265
00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:18.140
on. So that can become
a bit much for, for

266
00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:22.660
the, for the port to
handle. So yeah. So then

267
00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:26.470
you are handling the serial
work, you're handling the retries.

268
00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:30.310
You're also constantly querying in
between things saying, what's your

269
00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:34.360
temperature. You show it on
this lovely graph. It's, it's

270
00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:36.970
quite simple. I just drag
my G code file and

271
00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:39.430
I do a nice little
HTML file upload, drag, and

272
00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:43.870
drop there's also, I understand
talk of having it, do

273
00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:47.340
the slicing for you, is
that correct? Yeah. The, the

274
00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:51.080
current development version, or not
only the current development version,

275
00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:54.730
the, the, the current stable
wasn't already also allows you

276
00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:59.440
to configure Kira as a
slicer because the, the actual

277
00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:01.840
slicing engine that is part
of Cura, which is called

278
00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:06.550
the Cura engine runs quite
well on the respiratory pipe.

279
00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:08.590
So the problem with slicing
is that it needs a

280
00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:10.930
lot of CPU power because
there's a lot of math

281
00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:14.200
going on in there. So
usually an arm processor is

282
00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:18.550
not, not that perfect as
a target for something like

283
00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:22.420
that, but they Brown did
a really good, really, really

284
00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:27.400
great job with, with Kira
and even large piles are

285
00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:33.490
something that, that are, are,
you can even slice large

286
00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:36.250
files on a pie. So,
I mean, it takes of

287
00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:40.750
course longer than on a
full feature PC, but it's

288
00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:44.410
something that finishes in regular
times. No. Why would I

289
00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:46.360
want to do that though?
If I like, I, like,

290
00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:49.030
I like to see where
the supports are going to

291
00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:53.980
be, This is, this is
actually funny because I'm also

292
00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:56.680
in this, in this camp.
I also like to have

293
00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:59.050
the three D view and
see, okay, Oh, well, it's

294
00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:01.690
going to put the supports
in there. And if I

295
00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:05.200
know, if I now change
the parameter like that, then

296
00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.090
it will look like that.
And so, but there are

297
00:17:07.090 --> 00:17:10.480
actually people who, who wants
to be able to just

298
00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:13.840
put an STL, download an
STL, drop the STL file.

299
00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:16.630
So the actual model file
that they download it from

300
00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:19.660
something like thing. It was
a you imagine, or something

301
00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:21.640
like that. And just put
that on the, on the,

302
00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:24.700
on the printer and have
it, do everything fully, automatically.

303
00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:27.130
So they don't want to
care about that. And it

304
00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:34.630
also offers up things like
slicing from something like an,

305
00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:37.030
like a, like a mobile
app or so. So we

306
00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:39.820
don't have the app on
the, on the mobile, right.

307
00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:43.840
But instead use OctoPrint as
a slicing server and then

308
00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:48.340
use it like that. And
of course in the, in

309
00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:50.730
the final, it would be
great if you had something

310
00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:54.900
like the 3d few and
the slicing preparation and all

311
00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:57.360
that workflow, but in the
browser so that you can

312
00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:02.870
do it all in there.
I want to take a

313
00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:06.680
moment to thank our sponsors,
sync, fusion, sync fusions, mobile

314
00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:10.100
web, and desktop controls are
trusted worldwide, but did you

315
00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:14.630
know that they also provide
educational resources? The succinctly series

316
00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:18.650
of free eBooks has great
content on popular technologies and

317
00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:23.990
100 completely ad-free pages. These
books are written by industry

318
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:27.860
experts and topics range from
Cassandra to no JS to

319
00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:31.400
windows 8.1. They're available for
Kindle apps and in PDF

320
00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:35.270
format and new eBooks are
released each month. So Brown's

321
00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:44.900
their library@syncfusion.com to download your
free ebook today. I wonder

322
00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:47.030
if you could talk to
the folks at get hub,

323
00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:50.180
you know, they have that
lovely STL file 3d viewer

324
00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:52.130
now where you can take
an STL file and put

325
00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:54.830
it in GitHub, and then
you get, what if they

326
00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:57.320
would give you? I actually
looked at that. I think

327
00:18:57.350 --> 00:19:02.300
they actually open sourced that
already. Okay. And I think

328
00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:06.020
some guy on the, on
the OctoPrint ISC channel also

329
00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:10.100
said that he wanted to
look into SEL viewing within

330
00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:13.490
entrepreneur because the development version
now has the slicing support

331
00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:16.250
greatly enhanced. So you can
have multiple slicing engine. So

332
00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:19.220
if you don't like Cura,
then you can have a

333
00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:22.760
wire, some kind of plugin
can just use another one.

334
00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:26.810
And if it's not installed
on your respiratory PI, but

335
00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:29.480
somewhere in the cloud, then
that also is something that

336
00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:31.700
is in principle possible as
long as some are white

337
00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:35.390
supplicant plugin for it. So
you have a little dialogue

338
00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:37.880
now where you can select
which slicer in which file,

339
00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:41.060
and you can also re
slice things which was not

340
00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:44.660
prevalently possible with, with, with
other parameters and all that.

341
00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:50.990
And so, yeah, slicing within
OctoPrint is still a bit

342
00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:54.410
in its infancy, but we're
getting there slowly, but sadly.

343
00:19:54.590 --> 00:20:00.080
So my big 50,000 feet,
feet vision of all that

344
00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:04.580
will definitely be something that
allows this full workflow within

345
00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:09.530
the browser. So Absolutely now
we've mentioned the raspberry PI

346
00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:11.570
a few times, we haven't
actually formally come out and

347
00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:16.130
talked about Octo PI, which
is basically an image of

348
00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:19.970
OctoPrint fully prepared and running
for a raspberry PI. So

349
00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:21.590
I can go and take
my windows machine or my

350
00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:24.050
Mac. I can set up
OctoPrint in a few minutes,

351
00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:26.780
or if I have a
raspberry PI lying around, like

352
00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:29.630
I happen to have, I
can download an image and

353
00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:33.950
basically have this be when
I added a wifi adapter,

354
00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:38.330
fully wirelessly accessible three D
printers. So in my house

355
00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:41.450
right now on my, on
my iPad, I can hit

356
00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:44.660
OctoPrint or octopi in my
browser, and I get this

357
00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:48.610
wonderful environment and I can
control the printer remotely. Now

358
00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:52.690
is octopi a separate project
or a partner, or how

359
00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:56.550
does that relationship work? That
is actually a separate project.

360
00:20:56.550 --> 00:21:00.750
So what happened was I,
when I started entrepreneur, I

361
00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:04.050
put out a big installation
instruction on the GitHub Wiki

362
00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:07.230
four, four, OctoPrint where I
told if you want to

363
00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:08.700
run this on the rest
of the replies and you

364
00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:10.380
have to do this and
this and this and this

365
00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:14.580
and this and this and
this, and personally, yes. I

366
00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:17.280
mean, I didn't like that
either, but I just did

367
00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:21.150
not have the time to,
to, to do this differently.

368
00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:24.990
And then suddenly I got
in, in, in the, in

369
00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:27.000
the, in the Google plus
group, I think that I

370
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.700
maintain for OctoPrint. There suddenly
was a post by some

371
00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:33.000
guy from Israel who said,
Hey, I just wrote a

372
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.380
little image here, which has
all this OctoPrint installation included.

373
00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:43.530
And also the, the webcam
server that already preconfigured so

374
00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:46.170
that you can direct view
your prints and your browser,

375
00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:49.560
and also the little web
browser or not, sorry, not

376
00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:51.480
the web browser, the web
server that acts as a

377
00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:55.530
reverse proxy, so that webcam
and OctoPrint are reachable under

378
00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:58.980
the same URL. And it
also has this altar discovery,

379
00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:01.560
which you mentioned where you're
just type occupied at local

380
00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:04.620
and in any browser in
your local network. And then

381
00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:07.020
there is the web interface
and I was like, jaw

382
00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:12.510
drops to the floor. Yay.
Awesome. Yeah, that's that was

383
00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:16.290
really, really great. And then
we, we actually guy, guy

384
00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:20.070
Schaeffer is the one who,
who did this and we

385
00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:23.450
are regularly talking now and
synchronizing our releases and all

386
00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:26.520
that. But in the beginning
it was just him having

387
00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:29.820
an idea and just doing
it. And that was really,

388
00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:33.270
really grateful the community. Cause
now it's really just as

389
00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:35.340
easy as you said, download
the image, flash it, put

390
00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:39.570
it in the pile and
bam. And the thing is

391
00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:42.990
that one thing is still
a bit complicated setting up

392
00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:47.550
the, doing the initial wifi
setup. So because you have

393
00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:50.220
basically, you have a, have
a chicken egg problem here,

394
00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:53.370
because if you're having, if
you have a raspberry PI

395
00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:55.260
that does not have a
monitor and no keyboard, no

396
00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:57.330
nothing. How do you get
it on your wifi network?

397
00:22:57.710 --> 00:23:00.390
I, I hear what you're
saying, but honestly I went

398
00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:02.520
over to the television. I
plugged it in. I had

399
00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:04.530
a keyboard for five minutes.
I set it up and

400
00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:06.420
I haven't thought about it
since. So I think there

401
00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:10.740
is, But there are still
people who, who would be

402
00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:13.200
a bit far for whom
this would still be a

403
00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:16.110
bit complicated. So Three D
printing, wait a second. It's

404
00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:18.090
too complicated to do that,
but they're able to three

405
00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:19.890
D print things. I mean,
at some point you have

406
00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:23.790
to have a minimum ability
level. That's what I thought

407
00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:26.310
too. But after two and
a half years of maintaining

408
00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:30.030
OctoPrint I can now say,
Nope, you really have a

409
00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:33.240
very, very diverse crowd in
there. So making it easy

410
00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:39.600
for basically everyone is something
that It's reasonable to make

411
00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:40.980
it in the plan. You
want to make this an

412
00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:45.740
appliance. I still don't want
it want to dump it

413
00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:50.990
down Too much, because I
think if you're making one

414
00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:53.480
thing, one thing as I
said with, with current printers

415
00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:57.640
is that they still require
certain amount of maintainers and

416
00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:00.110
they still require a certain
amount of fiddling. So you

417
00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:03.260
dump everything down too much.
Then this fiddling will not

418
00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:06.670
be possible anymore. One of
the sizing thing was a

419
00:24:06.670 --> 00:24:09.940
little concerning to me. I've
downloaded three D models before.

420
00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:12.730
And if I had not
paid special attention to them,

421
00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:15.760
for example, they weren't completely
flat on the bottom. They

422
00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:18.970
were just like, literally skewed
by fractions of a millimeter.

423
00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:21.280
And I got weird prints.
I was like, Oh, this

424
00:24:21.490 --> 00:24:23.950
is just not flat. And
I had to go and

425
00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:26.170
make changes. It's just one
of those things. And you

426
00:24:26.170 --> 00:24:28.690
just would never see that.
It's almost like you can

427
00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:30.730
open a word file and
look at it and then

428
00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:33.280
print it. Or you can
right. Click on the word

429
00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:36.400
file and say quick print.
Right. And it'll just print,

430
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.820
but then you're just fire
and forget. And that's just

431
00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:42.670
seems scary to me, To
me too. But there are

432
00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:45.010
people, as I said, who,
I don't know, I don't

433
00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:47.200
know why I don't understand
it, but, But you want

434
00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:50.080
to support the users. One
of the most, one of

435
00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:52.360
the most amazing things. And
if there were a killer

436
00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:55.630
feature about OctoPrint and there's
so many, it's the, it's

437
00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:58.600
the camera. I got the
raspberry PI camera and I

438
00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:02.260
can see the print. It's
amazing. I've mounted it. I

439
00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:04.810
actually printed out a little
Mount it's sitting on top

440
00:25:04.810 --> 00:25:07.570
of it and the camera
then moves with, with the

441
00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:12.310
bed and you make these
glorious timelapses. Could you explain

442
00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:15.670
the different open source projects
and technologies that you brought

443
00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:19.840
together to make the, the
camera streaming in the browser

444
00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:24.430
plus the time lapse possible?
That was actually not that

445
00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:28.510
problematic to get it to
work in the browser because

446
00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:31.750
I'll let me start from
the beginning at first I

447
00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:34.570
thought, okay, great. It would
be nice if I could

448
00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:38.560
actually see what the printer
is doing right now, because

449
00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:43.430
seeing temperature, graphs and progress
bars and all that is

450
00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:45.910
all nice and well, but
in the end, you really

451
00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:47.860
want to see that it
is not, I don't know,

452
00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:49.900
jumping off the table right
now or something like that.

453
00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:56.080
And then I looked into
trying to get a webcam

454
00:25:56.440 --> 00:26:01.060
run stream from within Python
on a raspberry PI. And

455
00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:03.220
it turns out that with
open CV, that would have

456
00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:05.680
been not a problem at
all, but the pay was

457
00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:07.960
not up to it at
all. And CV is the

458
00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:10.810
Python imaging library that does,
Is this one of the

459
00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:14.560
pirates has an image. Yeah.
And so this was a

460
00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:17.110
dead end because basically it
was running fine on my

461
00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:20.320
development machine with like frame
rate of, I dunno, 25

462
00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:24.460
frames per second, all fine,
happy day. And then I

463
00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:26.320
try to run it on
the rest. Barry Pinder was

464
00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:29.620
getting barely one frame per
second, even less than that.

465
00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:32.500
So I scrapped all that,
threw it away and started

466
00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:35.950
looking for a Turnitin. And
this was when I stumbled

467
00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:39.970
across a little open source
to that back then I

468
00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:44.970
think maybe saw barely one
per year or something like

469
00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:50.580
that. It looked completely abandoned,
but I called MJ Peck

470
00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:53.470
streamer. So it basically is,
is a little server that

471
00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:59.070
connects to your MJ pixel
motion, JPEG capable, webcam, fetches

472
00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:01.620
the images and just streams
them out on a, on

473
00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:05.160
a socket in MJ pack
format. So basically motion JPEG

474
00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:09.840
is, is, is a moving
images form format, think like

475
00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:15.260
a Jif, but with JPEG.
So Right. If you make

476
00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:18.050
a get, and it's a,
multi-part where it just goes,

477
00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:21.950
JPJ, PJ, PJ pig never
stops. And so I call

478
00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:26.270
it a poor man's MP4.
Yeah. That's also in my

479
00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:32.210
motion motion. And, but the
good thing is that because

480
00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:36.260
if it can directly take,
take the, take the MJ

481
00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:38.690
PicStream from the camera, so
it doesn't have to do

482
00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:42.080
much on its own, which
is something that is very

483
00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:45.110
well suited. Find. I see.
So you're saying it's not

484
00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:48.320
compressing in real time. It's
just taking my buffer off

485
00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:50.870
of the camera and then
dropping it onto the chocolate.

486
00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:55.190
Exactly. I mean, I think
it's not that that truly,

487
00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:58.130
but this is basically the
gist of it. And it

488
00:27:58.130 --> 00:28:00.230
turns out that this is
exactly what you want to

489
00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:03.260
do on a raspberry PI,
because it's basically, it's something

490
00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:06.320
like one or 2% of
the CPO at all seq

491
00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:09.620
at all times, which increases
with more users, but still

492
00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:13.760
it's okay. And this was
when I realized, Hey, I

493
00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:15.800
might still be able to
get this webcam for you

494
00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:20.420
to work. So basically what
happens now is that you

495
00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:24.620
just run this little MJ
Peck STREAMA server that runs

496
00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:28.970
inside octopi a little, a
little webcam script detects if

497
00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:31.700
you connect to webcam and
if it's a USB webcam

498
00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:34.250
or if it's the recipe
cam and depending on which

499
00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:37.370
is what selects the right
configuration in order to launch

500
00:28:37.370 --> 00:28:43.310
server and Octo prints simply
just embeds this image, there's

501
00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:49.460
moving image. So OctoPrint itself
does not know how to,

502
00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:52.430
how to control the webcam.
It just knows, okay, there

503
00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:55.910
is a URL and I
will embed this there in

504
00:28:55.910 --> 00:28:59.270
the website and boom, you
have a moving image. And

505
00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:03.860
then there's also this additional
feature where you can have

506
00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:07.040
it make time lapse videos
of your prints. So basically

507
00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:10.670
this is something that I
saw that Cura had and

508
00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:14.660
thought it was a very,
very nice feature because it

509
00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:16.640
really helps in the packing
stuff. And also it looks

510
00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:21.800
cool. So basically what you
need to do for a

511
00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:25.220
time lapse is you just
fetched an image in regular

512
00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:28.490
intervals and later one, stitch
this together into a movie.

513
00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:31.370
And this is basically what
entrepreneur does. So it just,

514
00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:34.760
it does not only get
told here's a stream of

515
00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:36.890
a webcam to place a
bet here on the webpage,

516
00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:39.320
but you also tell it,
and here is a URL

517
00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:44.980
where you can fetch regular
standing, still images. And if,

518
00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:48.180
you know, configure occupied to
create a time and we'll,

519
00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:52.180
we'll use that URL fetch
again, the image regularly and

520
00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:55.530
Indiana just stitch everything together
with, as an F F

521
00:29:55.600 --> 00:30:03.010
impact. And that's that. So
basically that's, that's the webcam

522
00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:06.900
support in OctoPrint and It
is, it is if you're

523
00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:09.990
gonna go out and quote
unquote, sell OctoPrint and buy

524
00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:11.910
sell. I mean, I want
people to get excited about

525
00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:13.680
three D printing. So I
recently went to a bunch

526
00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:16.380
of high school students. So
I'm selling them three D

527
00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:19.800
printing and I showed them
the realtime three D printing

528
00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:21.000
and they didn't, they, you
know, they thought it was

529
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.990
interesting, but their brains didn't
explode. Then I showed them

530
00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:28.770
a seven hour print of
a coffee cup made with

531
00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:32.940
OctoPrint using the time lapse
going, you know, basically seven

532
00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:36.030
hour print and seven minutes.
And they just thought that

533
00:30:36.030 --> 00:30:38.520
was amazing. That is the
feature to show people like,

534
00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:41.220
Oh my goodness, look at
this it's time lapse. And

535
00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:44.040
it just builds up this
three D model and the

536
00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:46.410
kids are like, I want
to make toys. I want

537
00:30:46.410 --> 00:30:48.060
to do this. I want
to do that. It is

538
00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:51.990
an absolutely extraordinary feature. And
also for debugging, what went

539
00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:54.990
wrong, it has been extremely
helpful for me, four hours

540
00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:57.750
in I've left. I come
back, the print has gone

541
00:30:57.750 --> 00:31:00.120
bad and I can actually
watch and see the moment

542
00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:03.330
when everything went South. It's
a, it's a great, great

543
00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:07.320
feature. So the last question
I wanted to ask you

544
00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:10.200
a kind of, as we
close, is that you had

545
00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:13.680
a job, you were doing
your Java consulting enterprise kind

546
00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:17.280
of big company thing. You
had your hobby and then

547
00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:19.380
now there's your hobby become
your job. How did you

548
00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:22.710
pull that off? That is
the open source dream. Yeah.

549
00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:28.950
And I certainly did not
expect this. So maybe first

550
00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:31.560
start with, with the thing
that I had, I had

551
00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:34.620
my full time job, then
I had OctoPrint and then

552
00:31:34.650 --> 00:31:40.260
I managed to get my
employer to agree to boiling

553
00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:43.680
down my, my full time
job to 80% job. So

554
00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:46.740
I had at least one
day for a week off

555
00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:52.470
for entrepreneur work of course,
with, with less money, but

556
00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:57.640
okay. I mean, that's what
your passion. Yeah, that's, that's,

557
00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:00.810
that's what my passion was
all about. And then, but,

558
00:32:00.810 --> 00:32:03.060
but it turned out that
this is one day, it

559
00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:06.270
was just not enough. And
so I was really starting

560
00:32:06.270 --> 00:32:11.910
to get overworked and frustrated
and I just did not

561
00:32:11.910 --> 00:32:14.400
have enough time to do
everything that I wanted to

562
00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:17.310
do because I had so
many great ideas and just,

563
00:32:17.490 --> 00:32:21.930
you know, I also had
to sleep sometime. And then

564
00:32:21.930 --> 00:32:25.800
suddenly I got a nice
email from some, some engineer

565
00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:30.220
at, at the Spanish company
asking me to, Hey, we

566
00:32:30.270 --> 00:32:33.150
just discovered OctoPrint and we
also have three D printers

567
00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:36.000
and don't you maybe want
to meet up, meet with

568
00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.440
us. We will invite you
and just come down. And

569
00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:43.640
this was like nearly a
year ago now. And I

570
00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:48.140
flew down there and we
talked and they basically said,

571
00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:51.020
okay, you know, I mean,
we really, really like what

572
00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:54.770
you do and we want
to hire you and you

573
00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:58.010
just keep doing on what
you do. And maybe if

574
00:32:58.010 --> 00:33:01.340
we need something, because we
also want to use it,

575
00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:04.400
we really, really want to
use it. And if we

576
00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:06.650
need something down, we can,
we can talk about it

577
00:33:06.650 --> 00:33:10.600
and see how best to
get it done in a,

578
00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:12.800
in a sense that also
makes sense for everyone else.

579
00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:16.940
And so this is where
we are now. I basically

580
00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:20.690
work full time for four,
four BECU, which is set

581
00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:24.590
Spanish company. And I fly
down every two or three

582
00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:27.020
months to Madrid to have
some face to face time

583
00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:29.540
with the colleagues and the
rest of the time I

584
00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:32.690
sit here in my home
office from Monday to Friday

585
00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:35.540
nine to five, no more
than nine to five, actually,

586
00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:40.190
and a code way on
OctoPrint. And since I started

587
00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:43.430
working full time on OctoPrint,
which was in August last

588
00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:48.770
year, I, I have the
feeling that I really, really,

589
00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:52.040
really managed to move the
project forward in, in large

590
00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:55.100
steps. I mean, most of
that is still not available

591
00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:57.380
to the general public in
a, in a way that

592
00:33:57.380 --> 00:34:01.790
it's still not on the
stable branch, so everyone can

593
00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:04.820
use what is being developed
all the time. It's it's

594
00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:09.230
completely open still, but it
of course, as a bit

595
00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:11.870
of a hurdle for people
who are not that comfortable

596
00:34:11.870 --> 00:34:14.850
with switching branches and all
that. But I think as

597
00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:19.340
soon as I get the
release out of currently working,

598
00:34:20.670 --> 00:34:24.500
I'm currently working everything off
to, to, to get out

599
00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:28.450
of the door. People will
be amazed. Do you think

600
00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:31.510
I personally, by the way,
I have been SSH into

601
00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:35.860
my raspberry pie and occasionally
doing a get poll and

602
00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:39.460
then resetting OctoPrint and starting
again and jumping around different

603
00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:42.550
branches. Do you think that
you're a little bit conservative?

604
00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:44.830
I think you'd have so
many users that you expect

605
00:34:44.830 --> 00:34:48.370
this thing to just work,
that you really want this

606
00:34:48.370 --> 00:34:51.880
to be a perfect baked,
because I've seen some features

607
00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:53.560
and I've come back over
to stable and I've said,

608
00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:57.700
gosh, why hasn't she released
this yet? Yeah, the problem

609
00:34:57.700 --> 00:35:00.490
is that a big, a
big number of the, of

610
00:35:00.490 --> 00:35:03.850
the features that are currently
new in the development branch

611
00:35:03.970 --> 00:35:09.070
are things that, so for
example, the plugin system that

612
00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:13.870
is now new, that I
really, really need to make.

613
00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:19.810
Yeah, perfect in air quotes,
because once this is out

614
00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:23.260
and people start using it
to develop like ins, I

615
00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:26.980
can't really change anything on
it anymore. So this is

616
00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:29.740
why it's taking exceptionally long
right now to get the

617
00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:32.080
stuff out of the door,
because I really don't want

618
00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:34.720
to shoot myself or the
project in the foot by

619
00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:38.100
now releasing something. And I
don't know, three months think,

620
00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:40.800
Oh dear, why did I
do it like that? And

621
00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:42.960
now we're stuck with it
and we'll be able to

622
00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:46.250
fix it. And as a
plugin model, when creating a

623
00:35:46.250 --> 00:35:49.400
plugin, you are effectively bootstrapping
an ecosystem. You're going to

624
00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:53.990
have a whole community jump
up around your community and

625
00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:55.880
start making stuff. And if
you don't get that interface,

626
00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:57.380
right, I could definitely see
where that would be a

627
00:35:57.380 --> 00:36:01.430
point of stress. Exactly. And
this is why I'm really,

628
00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:05.090
really, really spending a lot
of time these days documenting

629
00:36:05.090 --> 00:36:08.990
and refactoring and documenting some
more and refactoring some more.

630
00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:12.740
And I wrote a big
plug in tutorial on how

631
00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:14.960
to write your first plugin
and what to do and

632
00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:18.230
with, with, with step-by-step and
everything. And people are actually

633
00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:23.030
starting to contribute this way.
And this is great because

634
00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:26.480
so far, I mean, I
just had OctoPrint as a

635
00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:30.140
monolithic structure with me being
the only person being able

636
00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:35.360
to pull to push on
that and pulling requests, always

637
00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:38.600
being something where I had
to consider, well, does this

638
00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:42.110
really add value for everyone?
And will it just, will

639
00:36:42.110 --> 00:36:45.770
it may maybe just at
problems later for others and

640
00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:48.230
all that. And now it's
just like, here's a plucking

641
00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:51.560
interface program against it. And
if people want to use

642
00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:53.960
your stuff, they can just
install your plugin and be

643
00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:58.190
happy with it. That's a
really interesting question. And some

644
00:36:58.190 --> 00:37:01.160
people like to have the
code their own, and they

645
00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:04.700
don't want pull requests. I'm
not necessarily saying that this

646
00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:06.490
is you, but I'm just
saying that people like, but

647
00:37:06.490 --> 00:37:07.940
this is my baby. I
understand where I want it

648
00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:10.850
to go. I am the
chief programmer. I will decide

649
00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:13.730
where the main features are.
And then you have to

650
00:37:13.730 --> 00:37:16.580
fight with people about pull
requests, or I think you

651
00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:18.410
do what you're doing, which
is extremely smart, which is

652
00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:21.650
make a plugin model and
say, listen, you go nuts.

653
00:37:21.650 --> 00:37:24.260
Do whatever you want. Stop
sending me, pull requests, make

654
00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:28.250
a plugin. And if your
plugin become super popular, then

655
00:37:28.250 --> 00:37:30.950
we'll, we'll talk later. That's
a nice balance between those

656
00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:35.330
two choices. I think The
problem also is the question

657
00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:38.660
of maintenance, because basically if
I've, if I pull in

658
00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:41.270
a lot of features from
other people, first of all,

659
00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:44.900
I get quite quickly something
that's called feature bloat. So

660
00:37:44.930 --> 00:37:47.720
I have a tool which
basically can do everything but

661
00:37:48.350 --> 00:37:53.240
brew coffee, but it, the,
the chances are higher that

662
00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:56.600
it can do a lot
of things, but not do

663
00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:59.600
all of them very well
anymore because you constantly have

664
00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:02.210
to try to balance everything
with each other and you

665
00:38:02.210 --> 00:38:04.310
fiddle around on one end
and stuff breaks on the

666
00:38:04.310 --> 00:38:09.140
other. So everything becomes needlessly
complicated. So this is why

667
00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:12.830
so far, I always have
been quite conservative when accepting

668
00:38:12.830 --> 00:38:16.010
pull requests, because I wanted
not to end up with

669
00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:19.790
features that I personally don't
even use because I don't

670
00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:22.190
want them to use, I
want to use them, but

671
00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:24.320
I can understand if other
people want to use them,

672
00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:27.560
but still, if I match
it, then I'm responsible of

673
00:38:27.830 --> 00:38:30.710
maintaining it. Because usually when
you merge your pull request,

674
00:38:31.490 --> 00:38:33.770
you will have someone who
can't repeat a code, and

675
00:38:33.770 --> 00:38:36.640
then he's gone exactly pull
requests when they fix Bugs

676
00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:39.820
are a gift, but pull
requests when they are a

677
00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:42.340
new feature, an entirely new
subsystem are kind of an

678
00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:46.260
unwanted house guests. I wouldn't
call it an unwanted house.

679
00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:50.640
Yes. But it can become
complicated. So this is why

680
00:38:50.670 --> 00:38:53.940
I, one of the reasons
why I wanted to have

681
00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:56.940
a plugin system in there
from, I don't know, maybe

682
00:38:57.480 --> 00:38:59.250
half a year down the
road from the start of

683
00:38:59.250 --> 00:39:01.500
the project, but never found
the time and the resources

684
00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:04.620
to do it until I
started working full time on

685
00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:08.010
it. And it's, it's actually
funny because I'm, I'm now

686
00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:12.870
noticing that I, myself am
now developing more features than

687
00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:16.290
before, but now just as
plug ins. So for example,

688
00:39:16.290 --> 00:39:21.270
last week I started looking
into, into home ultimization based

689
00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:24.330
on MQTT, which is a
pub sub mechanism used for

690
00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:28.380
internet of things, devices. And
I actually did this for

691
00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:32.010
something completely unrelated, but when
I looked into MQTT for

692
00:39:32.010 --> 00:39:34.860
men, that would be something
nice to have an entrepreneur

693
00:39:34.890 --> 00:39:37.560
so that it would basically
publish its current state on

694
00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:40.340
the bus so that other
things could hook into that.

695
00:39:40.350 --> 00:39:43.050
And so on the weekend,
I quickly whipped up an

696
00:39:43.050 --> 00:39:47.820
MQTT plugin. So now you
can just add MQTT support

697
00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:51.690
to OctoPrint by downloading that
plugin. And that's it. So

698
00:39:51.690 --> 00:39:54.240
it's completely separated from the
rest of the code, no

699
00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:56.010
one who doesn't want to
use it, has to use

700
00:39:56.010 --> 00:39:59.520
it, but the option is
there and this is constantly

701
00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:02.160
happening to happening to myself.
Now, I think of something

702
00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:04.680
I quickly whip up a
plugin and next thing you

703
00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:08.850
know, I have something new
for OctoPrint, but not directly

704
00:40:08.850 --> 00:40:12.150
integrated into occupancy so I
can maintain it separately from

705
00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:14.580
each other. And I don't
have to worry about breaking

706
00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:18.240
stuff in between. That's really
nice. Well, I have to

707
00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:21.540
say as a user and
as someone who enjoys watching

708
00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:24.960
really well-run opensource projects that
I have very much enjoyed

709
00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:28.410
using and watching you code
on OctoPrint and I want

710
00:40:28.410 --> 00:40:30.540
to thank you so much
for your time for chatting

711
00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:34.200
with us today. Thank you
very much for having me

712
00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:40.710
and thanks for the copayments
Folks can get octoprint@octoprint.org. And

713
00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:43.380
if you are doing three
D printing, this is your

714
00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:46.680
first step set up your
printer, get OctoPrint. It is

715
00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:50.610
an absolute joy. This has
been another episode of Hanselminutes

716
00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:52.110
and we'll see you again
Next week.
