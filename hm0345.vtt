episode, Scott talks with Microsoft
employee and world-class climber Audrey

9
00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.180
sneezing. Hi, this is Scott
Hanselman. This is another episode

10
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.940
of Hansel minutes. And today
I'm talking with Audrey sneezy,

11
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.700
who is a program manager
on the Azure team working

12
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.390
in compute, but that's not
why I called you Audrey.

13
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.110
You have a really cool
hobby. Yes, yes I do.

14
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:14.700
Would you call it a
hobby or would you call

15
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.770
it a life obsession that,
that you would rather be

16
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.610
doing than working? I think
of it more of a

17
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.210
life obsession. What do you
do that you're world-class at

18
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.800
tell me I'm a rock
climber. Are there talk to

19
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.080
me about rock climbing. There's
different kinds. There's like bouldering

20
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.690
and there's rock climbing without
a rope and with, with

21
00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.360
the rope and there's various
kinds of rock climbing. We

22
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.340
know nothing about this. So
break it down for me.

23
00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.850
Yeah, there are different kinds
of rock climbing. There's a

24
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.530
lot of times when I
tell people that I rock

25
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.470
climb, they think of Mount
Rainier or these big peaks.

26
00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.860
And that is definitely a
type of climbing, but it's

27
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.550
not rock climbing. A rock
climbing actually has different facets

28
00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.920
within it as well. There's
full doing, as you mentioned,

29
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.960
where you climb small, smaller
rocks and you have these

30
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.880
crash pads to catch you.
So you don't have a

31
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.580
rope attached to you and
you have a group of

32
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.330
people usually huddled around to
keep you from hitting objects.

33
00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:11.540
If you fall to the
ground, and then you have

34
00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.280
these big walls that are
rock cliffs that you might

35
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.290
see around cliff bands that
are around the mountains or

36
00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.740
even up in the mountains.
And within that, you have

37
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.470
people who hike very long
distances to get to these

38
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.470
peaks, to climb them. And
then you have something more

39
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.990
like what I do, which
is I go out to

40
00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.440
maybe smaller approaches within the
30 minute, 40 minute range,

41
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.740
not to high elevation gain,
but you approach these rock

42
00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.490
walls. And then they are
about several hundred feet, maybe

43
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.680
a varying Heights. And I
scale those. And they range

44
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.170
in difficulty from scrambling to
very technical, could be very

45
00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.180
steep at the angles of
the, or are multifaceted. And,

46
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.950
and that's what I like
to do is really go

47
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.320
for difficulty, go for the
hardest kind of lines in

48
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.430
that, in that space, 30,
30 to 40 minute range

49
00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.260
is that the distance that
you're driving or long at

50
00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.760
the time, it takes for
you to do the rock.

51
00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.150
Just the time that I'm
hiking, some hikes are five

52
00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.700
minutes. Some are two minutes,
some are 30 minutes, 40

53
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.180
minutes. Generally, if you're hiking
for miles to get to

54
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.500
a wall, that's more of
an Epic journey. I tend

55
00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.890
not to do those. Those
are more like Alpine approaches.

56
00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.160
Why does the hike to
the rock matter? Is that

57
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.720
just whether or not you
have energy when you get

58
00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.060
there? Some of it is
about that. Some of it

59
00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.940
is that the gear required
to do a climb in

60
00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.330
that region. I have to
haul a rope and, and

61
00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.940
sometimes the equipment that you
want to attach yourself to

62
00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.980
the rock, other kinds of
supplies, food, harness, blade devices,

63
00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.520
warm clothes, things like that,
extend to weigh a bit

64
00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.010
more and, and can be,
can make those hikes rather

65
00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.360
laborious. I've got, I've got
little kids and they are

66
00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.540
always looking for new stuff
to do. And I'm hoping

67
00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.190
that at some point in
their life, they're going to

68
00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.090
discover that thing that they
want to do exclusively. You

69
00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.890
know? And if that thing
makes the money great, and

70
00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.320
if it doesn't make the
money great, maybe it's Legos

71
00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.800
or maybe it's making movies,
but they haven't discovered it

72
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.530
yet. Cause they're little kids.
When did you discover that?

73
00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.540
This was the thing. I
mean, there must've been lots

74
00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.910
of things you must have
tried growing up, but then

75
00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.450
you found this. Yeah. I,
I didn't try too many

76
00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.840
things growing up. Actually. I,
I was very, I'm very

77
00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.170
athletic. I've always been drawn
to sports. I didn't play

78
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.390
a lot of sports growing
up. I did run track

79
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:40.620
and cross country in high
school and I continued to

80
00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.390
run. I love running, but
I've never done. Marathon type

81
00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:49.710
runs. These are really mid
distance, five, 10 K max.

82
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.380
I don't aspire to anything
longer, but rock climbing came

83
00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.360
to me in university. Some
friends had discovered it wanted

84
00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.080
to introduce me to do
it, took me out to

85
00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.840
it and I just fell
in love with it. I

86
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.650
was pretty adept at it
quickly. I was convinced I

87
00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.560
wanted to do it all
the time. And the setting

88
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.620
with which I started was
serene and calm and peaceful

89
00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.400
for me. So climbing became
a place of serenity and

90
00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:21.000
the challenge gave me a
bit of drive and motivation

91
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.950
to keep at it. But
it was enough for me

92
00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:26.400
to feel like it was
an escape from normal life.

93
00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.010
It was something that provided
great satisfaction for me that

94
00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.230
really drove me to go
do it more and more.

95
00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.680
Do you remember like the
drive there? Were you thinking,

96
00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.810
Oh my goodness, this is
going to totally be awesome.

97
00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.390
Like you remember the drive
to your first rock climbing.

98
00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:42.750
Yeah. It's it was only
five minutes away from the

99
00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.900
university. So it really wasn't
very far. And we were

100
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.970
coming up to it and
this little, it would be

101
00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:50.370
like a Creek and you
would just hike down, you

102
00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.110
park at the top. And
so you don't see the

103
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.750
cliff right away and you
hike down and you're in

104
00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:59.960
this kind of a stream.
And, and there's this water

105
00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.450
flowing. You could hear that
bubbling over a little bit.

106
00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:04.970
And then you walk around
on this corner on the

107
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:08.120
small dirt path and there's
this little wall. It was

108
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.670
really tiny, really compared to
the walls I climbed today.

109
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:14.450
And it was just beautiful.
And they, you know, I

110
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:16.010
looked at the rock and
was like, we're going to

111
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:19.220
climb this. And then they
started to show me, this

112
00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:21.080
is a root and this
is a problem. And you

113
00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.410
go up here is something.
And as I started to

114
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.310
find the different lines that
people were drawn to on

115
00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:30.980
the rock, I started to
see opportunity. And it was

116
00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:34.520
just a really, really neat
place to go. It's very

117
00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.650
isolated and I'm in the
middle of the city. And

118
00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:42.310
how long ago was that?
That was 20 years ago.

119
00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.650
I am celebrating my 20
years of climbing this year.

120
00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:49.330
Wow. Okay. So I looked
around on the web and

121
00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.880
as I'm searching around for
some of your adventures and

122
00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:55.600
pictures of you climbing rocks,
I see this, this, these

123
00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.980
numbers they're saying, well, here
she is climbing a 5.14,

124
00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:02.080
and here she is climbing
at this point that, what

125
00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:06.190
does that number mean? The
numbers. In fact, the five.one

126
00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:10.120
four, we call it five
14. It's a great, you

127
00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.000
know, no worries. It's a
grading system that we use

128
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.230
here. And that is the
SMT system. The Americas pretty

129
00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:21.820
much follow that the Europeans
have a different system, Australians

130
00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:24.130
have a different system. So
there's multiple ways to grade

131
00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:28.240
the difficulty of a climb.
And in our system, a

132
00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:31.300
scramble where you might need
to tie in with ropes

133
00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:34.720
might start around a five,
five, so five dot five

134
00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:38.680
grade. And then you would,
you would grade the difficulty

135
00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.110
by number from there. So
you might have a five,

136
00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:44.530
five, a five, six, five,
seven, five, eight. And these

137
00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:47.260
are really the, the easier
set of clients. And as

138
00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:51.340
they go up, they become
gradually more difficult. And when

139
00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:53.830
you hit that five, 10
space, for some reason, we

140
00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:58.840
decided between five, 10, and
five 11, that we could

141
00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:01.660
be more granular in the
difficulty. So now you get

142
00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:04.450
five, 10, a, B, C,
D, and then you'll have

143
00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:07.960
five 11. So there's four
grades within each number per

144
00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:13.180
or after that. And once
you hit five 14, we've

145
00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:16.830
had, we now have something
that's called a five 15,

146
00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:20.410
five, 15, five, 15 being
maybe the potential for five

147
00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:23.710
15 C. Those are the
cutting edge difficulty lines that

148
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:26.560
are being established today. And
they're only a few, a

149
00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.740
few of those in the
world and only a very,

150
00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:32.650
very few people who can
climb at that level. So

151
00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:35.120
down from there, you can
see that if you get

152
00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:37.720
it up to that difficulty
marking, you're, you're pretty much

153
00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:41.020
at the echelon group of
people who can climb at

154
00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.500
that grade. And what does
the five mean? If, if,

155
00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:46.390
if, if easy starts at
five something, then there's no

156
00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:48.670
fours or threes walking around
to the mall as a

157
00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:52.000
three That's right. It actually
does go something like that.

158
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
And there's a whole, that
scale is more in the

159
00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:57.570
mountaineering books. It's outlines, like,
you know why it starts

160
00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:59.970
at five or whatever, it's,
it seems silly. It seems

161
00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:01.680
kind of random, but that
that's how we do it.

162
00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:04.940
Okay. So then if I
understand what you just said,

163
00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:09.380
then five 14 would be
non-trivial for anyone That's right.

164
00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:12.770
Five 14 is a highly
sought after grade for everyone

165
00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:15.830
in climbing. If you, if
you're driven for that, But

166
00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:19.490
you were climbing that 10
years ago, 15 years ago,

167
00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:23.450
even more Actually, no, I,
I came at rock climbing

168
00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:26.540
very much like the average
person, very recreationally for a

169
00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:31.250
number of years. And I
was climbing five. I was

170
00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:35.060
climbing hard five 11 for,
for the duration of that

171
00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:38.030
time period, until I decided
that I thought I could

172
00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:40.700
do more and wanting to
try to attain a five,

173
00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:43.670
14 grade one day. So
I've only just done my

174
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:48.230
first two, five fourteens this
year. Wow. Okay. And is

175
00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:50.810
this common for, for women?
Is there a, like, what

176
00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:52.550
does, how does it, how
does it break down on

177
00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:56.180
the gender lines? Like men
have upper body strength, but

178
00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:59.390
women have legs. And I
understand that leg strength is

179
00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:03.290
super important for climbing Tech.
Yeah. Leg strength can translate

180
00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:06.710
into technique is what we
call it. And it's definitely

181
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:08.660
true that men tend to
come at it. It's more

182
00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:11.510
powerful brute force way. And
women tend to come at

183
00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:14.780
it from a more technical
aspects, not universally true, but

184
00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:18.380
it's generally true. And I
think, you know, women, or

185
00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:20.660
in my case, for sure,
I work really hard at

186
00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:23.660
trying to develop power and
become a more powerful climber.

187
00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:26.150
And I know that there
are some very strong men

188
00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:28.310
out there who they focus
a lot on their technique,

189
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:32.030
trying to become a more
technical climber. And the balance

190
00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:36.500
of that really, really can
improve your climbing potential. That

191
00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:38.450
doesn't mean that you can't
be a five 14 climber

192
00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:40.760
and just be powerful or
just be technical with some

193
00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:45.410
power. I think it's very
individual. It's the, I would

194
00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:48.200
think, and I'm not a
climber. I've taken the kids

195
00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:51.110
bouldering like at a club
once and they thought it

196
00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:55.940
was fun. But as an
engineer type person, I am

197
00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:57.950
immediately starting to try to
solve this in my head.

198
00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:01.100
And I'm thinking to myself
that the amount of power

199
00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:03.440
that you could produce as
it relates to your weight,

200
00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:07.100
if you could remain small
and thin and light, but

201
00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:09.140
have a lot of power
in your arms and legs,

202
00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:11.720
that would be good. So
if you gained 10 pounds

203
00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:13.630
of muscle, that might be
good, but then you gotta

204
00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:15.860
to carry around 10 pounds
of muscle. Do you think

205
00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:18.260
about anything? I do. I
think about that a lot.

206
00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.110
I think a lot of
climbers think about that. And

207
00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:22.940
especially when you're trying to
do the more difficult routes,

208
00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:26.540
I think, as an athlete
in any trade, when you're

209
00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:29.210
obsessed at that level, it's
somewhere along the line, you

210
00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:31.970
start to think about your
weight, strength to weight ratio.

211
00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:35.090
And, and how does that
work for you? I mean,

212
00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:37.160
you, you, I assume you
can do a lot of

213
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:42.710
pull-ups. No, actually I can't,
I don't train a lot

214
00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:45.950
of pull-ups. I do do
a fair number and I've

215
00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:50.150
certainly done some training with
pull-ups over the years, but

216
00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:53.890
I don't do a lot
of them. I do focus

217
00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:57.190
a lot on training for
power, and that might include

218
00:11:57.190 --> 00:12:03.460
some pool type exercises. And
I think it's a combination

219
00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:09.550
of the, the core balance
and strengths with some lean

220
00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:12.670
leaning out so that you're
not too muscular, but you

221
00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:16.630
have some muscle, you train
fast Twitch, so you can

222
00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:20.440
react and be powerful and
you don't want to bulk

223
00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.790
up and you don't want
to be too lean. So

224
00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:24.400
you can't tap into that
power cause you're too hungry

225
00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:26.710
and starved. So you can't,
you have no energy to

226
00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:30.550
supply that. So it seems
like for me, it's just

227
00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:33.700
a big, it's a balancing
game. There, there are definitely

228
00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:38.260
times when I'm focused more
on building power and not

229
00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.750
worrying about whether I build
muscle mass and trying to

230
00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:42.700
be strong. And then there
are definitely times when I'm

231
00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:46.120
worried about, can I be
leaner and increasing my cardio

232
00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:49.450
to try to improve that
aspect. And maybe that's targeting

233
00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:52.660
a specific time for climbing
outside, or maybe it's a

234
00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:57.550
specific competition, but I certainly,
I certainly appreciate the moments

235
00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:00.430
when I can be more
carefree and just climb for

236
00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:02.350
fun and not think about
what I'm eating or not

237
00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:05.260
eating and worrying about whether
I'm training or not training

238
00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.790
to give myself that little
break and then, and then

239
00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:10.000
pick it up. And in
times when I'm ready to

240
00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:13.260
drive again. Well, that's interesting
because that makes me realize

241
00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.320
that I'm learning about this,
or I'm trying to analyze

242
00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:17.880
it in my head, but
that does kind of take

243
00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:19.920
away the, kind of the,
just the pure joy of

244
00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:23.400
climbing. But there is, there
is the need to do

245
00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.230
both. If you want to
climb at the level of

246
00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:29.790
five 14, you can't just
roll up and start climbing

247
00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:32.280
to pull something like that
off. Right. I'd like to

248
00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:35.880
think so, but I do
know there are some very

249
00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:41.010
strong people, very talented people
out there who, who maybe

250
00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:42.900
are a bit of an
anomaly in that way and

251
00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:46.620
are climbing super strong at
these grades without, I don't

252
00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:52.140
know, many years or maybe
no training, Hey, this is

253
00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:54.720
Scott and I am really
excited about these guys. This

254
00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:57.120
is a special offer from
our friends at DN simple,

255
00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:01.380
true story. Carl reached out
to Dan simple to ask

256
00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:03.960
them if they wanted to
advertise with Hansel minutes because

257
00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:06.240
we liked them that much.
I was a kind of

258
00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.010
a funny thing. They didn't
come to us. We went

259
00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:10.680
to them because we think
DNSimple is great. It's a

260
00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:13.230
hosted DNS service that you
use to manage your domain

261
00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:16.350
names. Prices started about $3
a month for up to

262
00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:19.830
10 managed domains. You can
also use D and simple

263
00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:23.550
to register domain names, purchase
SSL certificates. All of my

264
00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:26.100
domains have been moved off
of GoDaddy and are now

265
00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:29.340
at DN simple. I like
it because there's an application

266
00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:31.800
on my iPhone. I can
manage my DNS from there.

267
00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:34.800
There's an API that you
can use. The best part

268
00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:37.500
actually is these one click
services. So you can register

269
00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:39.570
a domain, get it up
and running in a couple

270
00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:42.480
of minutes and then go
in and apply services to

271
00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:45.090
it. So you can say
this domain is for Google

272
00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:47.280
apps and this domain is
forget. Hub pages in this

273
00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:51.470
domain is preposterous, and they
know the DNS records and

274
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:53.960
set them up for you.
Even for something as complicated

275
00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:56.480
as Google apps, there's like
11 different settings. You need

276
00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:59.330
to create, they handle it
all for you. So here's

277
00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:02.900
the deal. They've got a
special 30 day trial. You

278
00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:06.770
can cancel at any time,
but Hansel minutes listeners get

279
00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:09.710
three months of free DNS
service. So you've got a

280
00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:16.580
DN, simple.com/h M special deal
for Hanselman it's listeners, just

281
00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:21.770
visit DN simple.com/h M Hanselman.
His listeners get three months

282
00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:25.400
of free DNS service love
these guys. They're so nice.

283
00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:31.070
DN, simple hosted DNS, check
'em out. If, if you're

284
00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:33.040
putting that kind of work
though into things like, like

285
00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.690
BMI and lean muscle mass
and things like that, is

286
00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:38.900
it mostly diet? Cause like
right now, my goal is

287
00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:41.630
to get a six pack
before I turned 40. And

288
00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:44.510
I'm hearing well, thanks for
laughing. And I'm hearing that

289
00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:47.210
that six packs are made
in the kitchen and it's,

290
00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:51.980
it's 70% diet. And unfortunately
the diets are really boring.

291
00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:54.470
And I'm wondering at the
level that you're operating at

292
00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:55.640
is this one of those
things where you just have

293
00:15:55.640 --> 00:16:00.010
to eat ground Turkey and
peppers all day. I have

294
00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:04.660
definitely had my diet called
boring before I, you know,

295
00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:07.450
I love food and I
love flavor. And I do

296
00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:12.550
like things that are not
healthy, but I also value

297
00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:15.520
what my diet provides me.
So when I am ready

298
00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:18.340
to get down to business
and be training and leaning

299
00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:21.520
out, having that kind of
a boring regiment is, is

300
00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:23.800
okay with me. I'm I
know why I'm doing it.

301
00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:26.980
I don't have cravings. It
really feeds and fuels me.

302
00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:31.360
And those benefits far outweigh
the blandness or the, or

303
00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:35.290
the non creativity of the
meal. But, you know, it's,

304
00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:37.510
like I said, I can't
do that 365 days a

305
00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:40.420
year. There are definitely times
when I'm focused like that.

306
00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:42.070
And then there are definitely
times when I am not.

307
00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:44.080
Can you give me an
idea if you don't mind

308
00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:46.540
my asking what a boring
diet would be? Cause I

309
00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:51.130
can take notes for myself.
Yeah. Well, so for instance,

310
00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:53.920
one thing that I actually
haven't changed in a long

311
00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:59.080
time is my breakfast and
my breakfast consists of a

312
00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:03.100
oatmeal and I have it
measured and I have a

313
00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:06.100
teaspoon of peanut butter in
it. And sometimes I spice

314
00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:07.720
it up. And by that,
I mean, I add like

315
00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:11.800
mangoes dried mangoes or raisins
or, or maybe even some

316
00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:15.160
maple syrup sometimes, but mostly
that's the base. And then

317
00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:19.780
I'd have eight ounces of
a protein drink and my

318
00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:23.860
vitamin some multivitamin, my fish
oil and CA and vitamin

319
00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:27.970
C absolutely need to have
that. And that's my breakfast.

320
00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:30.040
And that holds sustain me
for good part of the

321
00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:34.810
morning, no cravings. I feel
very satiated. It gives me

322
00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:36.790
the energy to go climbing
right after or go running

323
00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:38.350
or whatever I need to
do. That's active that way.

324
00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:40.810
And do you eat at
the, at the Microsoft cafeteria

325
00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:43.150
or do you bring Tupperware
with strange things in it?

326
00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:46.090
I, you know, I pack
my breakfast everywhere I go.

327
00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:49.890
When I'm traveling. I always
make sure of that is

328
00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:53.480
what I have. And lunch
Lunch is a little trickier

329
00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:56.120
because I think I can
find salads. I can find

330
00:17:57.470 --> 00:17:59.450
things that just work. So
generally I have a good

331
00:17:59.450 --> 00:18:03.410
salad, usually spinach salad, lots
of proteins like beans. I

332
00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:05.300
have a little bit of
fat in there. So artichokes

333
00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:08.210
or avocado, I don't have
any dressing in there. It's

334
00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:11.330
very lean. And so it
can have my two meals

335
00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:13.220
right now. This is what
I'm doing. Two meals that

336
00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:16.580
are pretty well balanced, pretty
lean. And then my dinners

337
00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:18.740
are, they're a little bit
free for all. They're not

338
00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:21.680
completely, you know, hamburgers and
French fries or something, but

339
00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:25.250
I definitely do have that
on occasion. And do you

340
00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:27.320
do calorie count or is
this more of a grams

341
00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:30.290
of protein type of a
diet? I've done a lot

342
00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:33.440
of research for myself on
the calorie counts and this,

343
00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:36.620
this diet has fallen out
from that research. So I'm

344
00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:39.110
not calorie counting at the
moment. I have done that

345
00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:41.960
in the past. I have
tracked every, every everything that

346
00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:44.390
I was eating and put
it into a spreadsheet and

347
00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:47.870
Mark, what I was doing,
I wore a little body

348
00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:51.620
bug and these are things
that track your calorie output

349
00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:54.350
against her calorie input. And
I learned a lot about

350
00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:57.800
my eating habits and I
think just understanding what my

351
00:18:57.830 --> 00:19:01.790
eating habits were helped me
define how I could maintain

352
00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:05.990
a better eating style today.
So, so for instance, I

353
00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:09.500
used to be a feast
starved eater, and I didn't

354
00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:12.530
know that. So what that
meant was if I felt

355
00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:14.750
that, and this was all
like something that was happening

356
00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:16.730
in my head, it was
a perceived notion. It wasn't

357
00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:19.880
actually a true representation of
what I was eating or

358
00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:22.010
not eating, but this is
the way my, I perceived

359
00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:25.010
it. If I felt that
I was eating too much

360
00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:27.230
than I would, you would
see my calorie count, go

361
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:30.950
up. And then when I
hit some perceived Mark, I

362
00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:32.870
would say, Oh gosh, I've
been eating too much. So

363
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:35.150
I need to pull back.
So then I would just

364
00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:37.370
under eat the calorie intake
I was supposed to have

365
00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:39.680
for a day or two
or three. And then gradually

366
00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:42.170
start putting more calories back
in as I started getting

367
00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:44.780
hungrier. And then you'd see
this like, Oh, well, I'm

368
00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:46.580
eating too little. So I'm
eating a little more and

369
00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:48.200
then I'm eating too much.
And then now I'm starving

370
00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:50.870
myself again and going back
up into these like highs

371
00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:54.800
and lows, and that's not
good for performed consistent performance

372
00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:58.250
or training, and certainly not
for your overall feeling of

373
00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:02.540
being satiated and well nutrition.
See, this is very sad.

374
00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:05.390
You've just described my last
month or two of dieting.

375
00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:08.090
Yeah. So I made a
change and now I eat,

376
00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:11.660
I eat more consistently this,
a similar calorie count more

377
00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:15.350
regularly and that it helps
me feel better. So this

378
00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:18.320
is interesting because I'm hearing
there is an animal, there's

379
00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:20.600
an analytics to this. I
mean, it's not just show

380
00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:22.970
up and be awesome. And
you know, you've obviously got

381
00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:26.240
some genetic talent, but you
have an adequate analytical mind.

382
00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:28.910
And presumably that's the same
kind of person that would

383
00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:32.030
create a, an Excel spreadsheet
full of diet information is

384
00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:33.800
the same type of person
that would create an Excel

385
00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:36.290
spreadsheet for work and do
all sorts of analysis about

386
00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:39.980
a particular feature in Azure
or something compute organized. I

387
00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:42.350
mean, how much do you
think that your personality is

388
00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:46.400
making you successful at work
and in your lifestyle? I'm

389
00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:49.900
sure it's the same. Yeah.
Yeah. I did a talk

390
00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:53.890
for Microsoft actually for climbing
training and in, there was

391
00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:58.240
a diagram of a pyramid
diagram for progression, and then

392
00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:01.180
I followed it with some
charts and I had to

393
00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:03.700
laugh. Yes. I had to
laugh because only a Microsoft

394
00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:06.910
person could appreciate that, that
there were charts in this

395
00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:10.410
PowerPoint slide about climbing training.
That's awesome. The fact that

396
00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:13.350
there's a PowerPoint at all,
as opposed to no field

397
00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:18.180
trip there, but it sounds
like your job. And forgive

398
00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:19.710
me if I'm taking you
in a direction, that's not

399
00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:23.430
okay, but you're choosing to
prioritize one thing over the

400
00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:27.270
other. Like you could be
all career focused and be

401
00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:29.670
at a high rank at
Microsoft. And I don't know,

402
00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:32.220
make lots of money and
I don't know, whatever Microsoft

403
00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:35.250
benefits would provide you if
you went kind of all

404
00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:39.630
out, but I'm, I'm seeing,
or I'm hearing that that's

405
00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:41.910
not your priority and that
you've got a nice, comfortable

406
00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:45.990
situation, a nice, comfortable position.
And it enables you to

407
00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:50.610
do more outside of Microsoft.
That's right. Actually, I'm very,

408
00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:54.720
very lucky. And I think
very fortunate to be in

409
00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:56.370
the position that I, that
I'm in. And I've worked

410
00:21:56.370 --> 00:21:59.700
really hard to create the
type of flexibility that affords

411
00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:04.290
me to be somewhere where
I have a very different

412
00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:09.040
backyard for climbing. Yeah. Yes.
And you've got, so you

413
00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:12.750
you're in Seattle right? Currently?
No, I'm not in Seattle.

414
00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:15.840
Where are you now? Are
you traveling? Yeah, I'm actually

415
00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:19.110
living in Kentucky for a
few months. Really. So you

416
00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:20.700
just like called your boss,
like, you know, Kentucky has

417
00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:22.530
some awesome rocks. Can I
do my job from here?

418
00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:26.190
No, it's not as simple
as that actually it would

419
00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:29.520
be great. It would be
great. There are definitely some

420
00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:32.160
things about my work environment
that I don't, I don't

421
00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:37.020
promote too highly or too
broadly. The reason is that

422
00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:39.810
it's not, it's not as
simple as that when you

423
00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:42.240
work away from the office,
things have to be seamless.

424
00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:45.810
They have to recognize you
as still being basically in

425
00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:49.140
the office, not traipsing the
world. Right? Cause it sounds

426
00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:52.170
like the vacation, this is
by no means a vacation.

427
00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:56.040
I think it's very much
a misunderstood idea when someone

428
00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:58.890
hears that I'm working remotely,
I'm living in, you know,

429
00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:01.290
in this wonderful place with
this great rock behind me.

430
00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:04.500
But my opportunities for climbing
are not as vast and

431
00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:07.620
bound as I would like,
but for me and what

432
00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:10.530
I'm accomplishing and being able
to hold my job, I

433
00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:12.940
don't care. Because like I
said, it's like having my

434
00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:16.080
own another backyard for me
to access and get that

435
00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:18.450
gives me when I have
free time, I get to

436
00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:20.340
go out and climb in
this fantastic rock. That's not

437
00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:22.830
in Seattle and not accessible
given the weather right now,

438
00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:27.180
but it is accessible here.
So it's a unique opportunity.

439
00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:28.860
And I realize that it's
a very rare thing and

440
00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:31.050
it's not common at Microsoft
at all. So I try

441
00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:33.720
not to take advantage. No,
I understand. Well remember you

442
00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:35.220
probably don't know this about
me, but I'm not in

443
00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:38.430
Seattle. I'm in, I'm in
Portland, Oregon and I work

444
00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:41.130
remotely and I've written extensively
on what it means to

445
00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:44.310
be not visible and how,
how often we as remote

446
00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:46.640
employees have to sure that
they know that we're there.

447
00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:48.920
I was actually, I mean,
I've been at Microsoft now.

448
00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:51.530
This will be five years
this month. And in a

449
00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:54.110
standup meeting recently, they were
going around in a circle.

450
00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:56.180
You're everyone was telling like
what they were working on.

451
00:23:57.090 --> 00:23:58.580
And they did this for
an hour and we had

452
00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:00.980
a round table and I
had a camera and everything

453
00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:03.770
like that. And they hung
up on me and I

454
00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:06.440
emailed my boss's boss. And
I was like, I never

455
00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:09.290
got to say what I
was working on. And he

456
00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:11.120
said, Oh, I couldn't see
the camera. I forgot you

457
00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:14.690
were there. And I was
like, Oh man. I mean,

458
00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:18.050
I've worked here for five
years, dude. I just, I

459
00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:19.820
just want to tell you
what I'm working on. So

460
00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:22.600
you don't fire me. That's
right. It's a, it's a

461
00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:25.810
very, it's a very challenging
thing to have a presence

462
00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:29.530
when you're not physically there
because despite the flexibility that

463
00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:34.810
Microsoft says, they promote the
culture is not necessarily in

464
00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:38.350
the same place place. Yeah,
exactly. The, the one benefit

465
00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:40.750
that I have is that
my team has a development

466
00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:43.960
office in Shanghai. And actually
my development team is in

467
00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:47.860
Shanghai that causes some problems
with time zone differences, especially

468
00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:50.410
when I'm remote and want
to get in some climbing

469
00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:53.440
at some point and still
work on Pacific time. But

470
00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:57.280
it works because they're used
to having people who are

471
00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:59.740
not in the office. And
so more often than not,

472
00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:03.070
we have our meetings are
set up always online. So,

473
00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:05.200
and that's a different, that's
different than the whole of

474
00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:08.230
the Azure world. This is
more my big compute area.

475
00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:12.160
Right, right, right. Do you,
do you think about your,

476
00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:14.200
your kind of your life
goals in the sense of

477
00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:16.390
like, you want to get
that next big promotion and

478
00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:18.580
move up and be a
manager and get a big

479
00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:21.070
sack of money or do
you think to yourself, this

480
00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:23.530
is a good level. Like
for me, I pushed and

481
00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:25.580
I pushed and I got
a level at Microsoft or

482
00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:27.130
a rank, you know, they
have all these different HR

483
00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:29.050
levels. And I think to
myself, all right, this is

484
00:25:29.050 --> 00:25:30.610
a good level. You know,
I could be at this

485
00:25:30.610 --> 00:25:33.610
level forever and never get
promoted again. And that's totally

486
00:25:33.610 --> 00:25:37.030
fine because my kids are
happy and my wife's happy

487
00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:40.210
and I got a good
lifestyle. Yeah. It's definitely crossed

488
00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:43.300
my mind. I know that
Microsoft just, isn't the kind

489
00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:46.360
of place that you can
stagnate at. And that levels

490
00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:49.510
and career development are really
important to the company. And

491
00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:52.990
that is a challenge. I
have conversations with management about

492
00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:56.770
futures and potentials, and I
do want to progress. I

493
00:25:56.770 --> 00:25:59.290
love what I do. And
I, I like working in

494
00:25:59.290 --> 00:26:03.460
this company and I do
want to see myself doing

495
00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:06.640
well, but I'm not willing
to sacrifice some things to

496
00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:08.710
do too well. And I
don't want to, I don't

497
00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:11.290
want to set a trajectory
that's too steep. So it

498
00:26:11.290 --> 00:26:15.490
definitely has a more plateaued
effect to it. Maybe more

499
00:26:15.490 --> 00:26:18.490
gradual slope than, than I
would otherwise have. And that's

500
00:26:18.490 --> 00:26:20.560
fine for me, as long
as I can continue to

501
00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:23.050
be rewarded for the quick
work I do. And that

502
00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:26.140
I see that I'm still
moving forward somewhere. Right. But

503
00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:28.540
you actually left and then
came back. Did you? I

504
00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:32.950
did. Yeah. That changed everything
that because of climbing that

505
00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:35.620
you left. Yeah. I left
and I went off the

506
00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:37.330
road. I bought a Euro
van and lived in it

507
00:26:37.330 --> 00:26:41.200
for 18 months just about,
and just traveled and climbed

508
00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:45.900
full time. No work. That's
awesome. It was really, really

509
00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:48.710
good. The, the thing that
I don't don't know, it

510
00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:51.380
has become clear yet in
this, in this talk and,

511
00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:54.020
and I'll, I'll give you
the compliment is that if

512
00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:56.030
I understand from everything I'm
reading about you and all

513
00:26:56.030 --> 00:27:00.650
these numbers, you're world-class or
damn near world-class at the

514
00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:03.680
climbing level, that's not a
hobby. That's not something that

515
00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:07.100
you see people climbing at
this level and also doing

516
00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:13.130
full time jobs. Do you,
I've, I'm actually impressed with

517
00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:15.350
the number of climbers that
do have full time jobs

518
00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:19.520
and climb really well. I,
I do think that when

519
00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:21.620
we, when you talk to
athletes and you, and you

520
00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:23.930
speak to climbers at that
level, it is a challenge,

521
00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:27.290
but we, you know, maybe
we're the personality types that

522
00:27:27.290 --> 00:27:28.970
will just do what it
takes to be able to

523
00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:31.670
satisfy both of those needs.
I don't know, but you're

524
00:27:31.670 --> 00:27:34.370
right. There's not that many
people, there are a few

525
00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:36.530
of us though. And is
it like a club? I

526
00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:37.940
mean, do you all know
each other just from, like

527
00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:39.560
you hear about like, Oh,
so and so did a

528
00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:43.280
five, 12 C and that's
crazy. Yeah. Actually the clubs

529
00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:46.310
online, you can go to
aa.edu and stalk us anytime.

530
00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:51.860
That's cool. That's cool. At
some point, will you, will

531
00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:53.720
you choose to plateau? And
you'll say, well, this is,

532
00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:55.820
this is breaking my body
down. Or the tendons in

533
00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:57.710
my hands are breaking down.
Or is there something that

534
00:27:57.710 --> 00:28:00.500
you can keep pushing, pushing,
pushing until you're into your

535
00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:03.290
fifties or sixties? Gosh, you
know, I really hope I

536
00:28:03.290 --> 00:28:05.420
can keep pushing it. I,
I really don't know where,

537
00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:08.690
where to stop right now.
I've seen people who are,

538
00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:11.930
you know, in their fifties
or even in their sixties

539
00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:15.440
and climbing really well. And
I know a gentleman, he

540
00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:19.380
did another 14 and he's
in his fifties and, and

541
00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:21.470
I just admire that they
can still be out there

542
00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:24.920
and climbing so strong and,
and pushing their limits. Even

543
00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:26.690
at that age, it just
shows me that there's no

544
00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:30.200
limits really. It's just whatever
you can think you can

545
00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:32.390
do and imagine, and have
the dry for go for

546
00:28:32.390 --> 00:28:35.360
it. And it might be
possible. What kind of things

547
00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:38.960
will, will start to break
down physically? Like I assume

548
00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:41.930
you're putting a lot of
the fingers I'm thinking about

549
00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:44.600
like, am I know from
typing my hands hurt and

550
00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:47.840
I've had tendon pops and
trigger finger surgery. I can

551
00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:50.150
only presume that you're doing
a lot to your hands.

552
00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:52.820
Yeah. I think the thing
that suffers the most is

553
00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:55.130
my computer work coupled with
the climbing, cause it's all

554
00:28:55.130 --> 00:29:00.650
forearm and arm based. But
really I think the things

555
00:29:00.650 --> 00:29:03.020
I notice the most are
my recovery times are a

556
00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:07.520
lot longer. I need more
rest. I can't do hard

557
00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:10.850
stuff as many hard clients
maybe, or as, as I

558
00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:13.370
used to be able to
do. So I have to

559
00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:16.220
be more efficient and selective
about how I go about

560
00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:19.850
training to prevent injury, to
stay healthy, to get stronger

561
00:29:19.850 --> 00:29:22.070
with, you know, the way
that I'm aware of my

562
00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:25.160
body. And, and that's, I
think a function of age,

563
00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:28.340
I think you watch the
kids today and they hang

564
00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:31.370
on forever, never get tired.
They have the strength to

565
00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:34.100
weight ratio that's just to
die for and as an

566
00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:36.950
adult. Yeah. And, and you
watch them, they can eat

567
00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:40.790
anything and, Oh, you know,
to be young again, I

568
00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:46.270
know just I'm Coming up
on 30, you know, on

569
00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:48.160
the North end of 40
there. And I'm starting to

570
00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:51.160
realize that just literally the
difference between 34 and 35

571
00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:54.130
and 38 and 39 is
just more than five years.

572
00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:58.000
It's like a decade, particularly
around recovery time. You have

573
00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.900
to, you have to move
smarter, which is really interesting.

574
00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:04.690
Well, this has been really,
really cool. This is fascinating.

575
00:30:04.690 --> 00:30:06.520
So it's okay for people
to go and check out

576
00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:09.220
your blog and your, you
have a Facebook athlete page.

577
00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:12.820
And what was the name
of the forum for learning

578
00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:21.420
about climbing? Yep. Okay. Cool.
Well, thank you Audrey sneezing

579
00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:24.450
for, for chatting with today
about climbing and a low

580
00:30:24.450 --> 00:30:26.940
work life balance. All right.
Well thank you for having

581
00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:30.240
me. This has been another
episode of Hansel minutes and

582
00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:35.580
we'll see you again next
week. <inaudible>.
