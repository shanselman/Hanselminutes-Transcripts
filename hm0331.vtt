00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:59.060
episode, Scott talks with Iris
class about starting programming. Hi,

9
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.340
this is Scott Hanselman. This
is another episode of Hansel

10
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:07.100
minutes today. We've got Iris
Classon. You're calling from Sweden.

11
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.990
Yes, that's true from Sweden.
Yes. Hi. Hi Andy. And

12
00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.660
you're originally Romanian, but you
spent most of your life

13
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.010
in Norway. You have a
very, very colorful background. Yeah,

14
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.880
I have. I've actually, I
was born in Romania, moved

15
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.880
to Norway when I was
five years old and I've

16
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.240
also lived in France, Denmark
and a little bit over

17
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.740
three years in Australia before
moving to Sweden about four

18
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.280
and a half years ago.
Yeah. So I've been moving

19
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.820
around a lot. So the,
one of the reasons I

20
00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.620
wanted to have you on
the show was a couple

21
00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.630
of things. First, you've got
a whole bunch of fans

22
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.420
on Twitter who said, you've
got to have Irish on

23
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.140
the show and I wasn't
familiar with you, but I

24
00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.200
started looking around and I
realized that what's interesting about

25
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.000
your story and why we
thought it would be fun

26
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.820
to have you on the
show. Was that you have

27
00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.100
been programming for just about
a year, is that correct?

28
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.970
Yes. That's true. It's official.
I've only been programming for

29
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.680
a year. So you started
out in a totally different

30
00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.750
field. You're if I understand
correctly, you're an actually a

31
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.020
registered dietician and a personal
trainer and are more involved.

32
00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.170
You're more of a fitness
person than, than a traditional

33
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.980
coder. Who's been programming since
you could talk. Yeah. Like

34
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.440
some people, I grew up
with a computer. I grew

35
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.490
up with apples and running.
Yeah, it's true. I'm a

36
00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.960
registered dietician, a clinical dietician,
personal trainer, and also a

37
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.960
nutritionist. So for the most
part of my life, I've

38
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.560
been working within the health
and private health care and

39
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.450
fitness industry. So how did
you get started in computers?

40
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.610
I mean, we use someone
who just had email and

41
00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.910
wasn't very technical and then
discovered coding one day. Or

42
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.180
how did that start? I
was one of those people

43
00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.390
you tell to please try
turning it off and all,

44
00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.790
and then you'll have to
come do it for me.

45
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.860
And it actually works. I
was studying nutrition in Australia

46
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.380
and that's where I met
my husband. And what happened

47
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.780
was I was, I was,
I wasn't really happy with

48
00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.960
studying nutrition, but somehow when
I grew up for me,

49
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.990
that seemed like one of
the few options I had

50
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:21.670
as a girl, you know,
you could call him my

51
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:28.450
hairdresser, a dermatologist or, or
nurse, or you could work

52
00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.380
within health, you know, a
lot of caretaking, you know,

53
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.880
options, I would say. So
I started studying nutrition because

54
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.210
it's, it, it felt the
right out of those options.

55
00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.030
I was really, really unhappy
with my studies and I

56
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.000
struggled a lot cause I
didn't have fun. And I

57
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.790
kind of had a gut
feeling it wasn't what I

58
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.670
wanted to do, but it
just, I didn't know what

59
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.880
else to do. And while
we were studying in Australia,

60
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.180
we, one day I was
just, I was so upset

61
00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.080
and I'd been crying of,
I've just been obsessed for

62
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.450
a very long time. So
we sat down me and

63
00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.540
my husband. Then we made
the list of all the

64
00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.690
possible jobs we could think
of like all the jobs.

65
00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.730
I think we even made
up a few, you know,

66
00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.160
just to fill out the
list. Once you get going,

67
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.720
you just, you know, you
want to add a few

68
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.930
more and then we wrote
down what I'm good at

69
00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:23.650
and what I like doing.
And that's actually how we

70
00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.560
came up with the idea
that maybe programming would be

71
00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.530
something for me. And at
that point I didn't even

72
00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.000
have a computer. So we
just pieced it together based

73
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.640
on what I like and
how I am as a

74
00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.190
person, because Is your husband
a programmer that he would

75
00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:47.100
have this idea? He's not
actually, he's a system specialist,

76
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.270
so not programmer, but he
does know his part of

77
00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.560
it and is really good
with hardware as well. So

78
00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.360
he knew off the options.
Now, for some, for some

79
00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.660
people who are thinking of
getting into, into software or

80
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.320
engineering or computer science, it,
they have a number of

81
00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.010
reactions. They might feel this
is boring. You know, coding

82
00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:15.570
is boring and it's, it's
not an exciting career. That's

83
00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.050
the perception that a lot
of people have. Why did,

84
00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.300
why were you not immediately
turned off by the kind

85
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:27.040
of classic media perception that
one has of programming and

86
00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:32.400
nerds and the intellectual pursuit?
Oh, because the way I

87
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.460
saw it, I wanted to
have a, I wanted to

88
00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.760
have a job that wasn't
a job I want, I

89
00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.580
just wanted to be doing
something else for eight to

90
00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:46.020
10 hours a day. That
was what I wanted. So

91
00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:50.160
for me, I was just
looking for something that would

92
00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.780
make my day interesting and
something that would something that

93
00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:58.520
would be fun. So I
never fought what others were

94
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.530
saying or what others were
thinking. Surely you must have

95
00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:05.140
had some image in your
mind about what a programmer

96
00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:09.100
did. Yeah. I did have
a couple of images such

97
00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:10.900
as, you know, you sit
down in the basement, it's

98
00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:15.940
completely dark. You have like
five computer screens. I had

99
00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.480
that image, but at the
same time, it didn't really

100
00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:23.380
scare me. Cause I guess
it's, it's a 2011 at

101
00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:28.780
the time. It was 2011.
And as just, my experience

102
00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:31.990
has been that often the
way we think things are,

103
00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:36.760
they're never that way. No,
you wish that you grew

104
00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:41.080
up in Romania initially, but
then most of your formative

105
00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:45.550
years in Norway, do they
teach women differently in Norway?

106
00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:48.250
Is there any kind of
a stigma between, as far

107
00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:52.990
as women learning math or
science or becoming doctors or

108
00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:57.070
hard engineering? I think, yeah.
I would actually say that

109
00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:01.930
the inner Romania they're more
prone towards having, for example,

110
00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:06.250
women learn math and engineering
compared to Norway, Norway, I

111
00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:09.010
would say is very old
fashioned and probably one of

112
00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:12.850
the countries are the most
old fashion. So that was

113
00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:15.940
a problem. I do remember
having a math teacher telling

114
00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:20.440
us that women weren't capable
of adding numbers because our

115
00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:24.880
brain didn't work that way.
So I don't think he

116
00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:28.090
was capable of adding friends
cause his brain didn't work

117
00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:33.790
that way. So yeah, no,
I would actually say on

118
00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:39.130
contrary that I didn't do
a, I didn't fare that

119
00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:41.950
well with mapping school because
of that, because they would

120
00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:46.720
prioritize the boys. So you
don't, you don't know whether,

121
00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:49.000
or you didn't know whether
your brain worked that way

122
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.190
or not because they didn't
give you the chance to

123
00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:54.460
try. It sounds like I
didn't do well in school,

124
00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:57.310
but I would do well
otherwise. And my mom's an

125
00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:00.940
engineer and also math teacher.
So I kind of knew

126
00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:04.210
because she would, she would
help me on the Well

127
00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:07.010
you did you, did you
get a chance to, to,

128
00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:10.090
to be, to, to succeed
in school or did something

129
00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:11.890
else keep you from doing
well in school? You say

130
00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:17.530
I did pretty shit in
school to be honest, most

131
00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:22.150
of all, because I was
a very difficult student and

132
00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:25.930
the Norwegian school system, you're
not supposed to ask questions.

133
00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:29.110
That's very, that's, you're just
supposed to sit there and

134
00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:32.020
just listen. And I had
a hard time doing that.

135
00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:35.110
So I was always asking
questions, which made me quite

136
00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:39.460
unpopular with most of the
teachers. So I didn't do

137
00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:42.940
too well. I actually stopped
going to school and dropped

138
00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:46.180
out. And what I did,
I just packed my bags

139
00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:50.170
when I was 18, 19
and I moved to Denmark

140
00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:53.650
and I just studied up
for all the exams on

141
00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:58.470
my own instead and got
top grades. But when I

142
00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:01.560
was in school, I had
bottom grades. I did really,

143
00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:04.860
really bad once I got
the control, I did well,

144
00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:09.090
but in the school setting
I did, I did pretty

145
00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:12.830
bad. So it's interesting that
you say that and you

146
00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:16.160
know, maybe have a touch
of, of ADHD. And these

147
00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:21.110
are typically personality traits, they're
stereotypes. So I understand that

148
00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:23.870
every time we mention a
stereotype, someone who's listening will

149
00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:27.050
email us and say, well,
that's a stereotype, but yeah,

150
00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.420
there's stereotypes because there may
or may not be something

151
00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:33.680
behind it. But people who
have attention disorders can sometimes

152
00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:36.680
turn those into a strength
and really learn that they're

153
00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:38.780
good at focusing on something.
So it sounds like you

154
00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:41.990
may have some personality traits
that will make you a

155
00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:44.870
very good programmer. What do
you think about that? I

156
00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:51.050
think definitely I do have
eight adult ADHD. The, I

157
00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:54.200
wasn't able to take any
medications because they were worried

158
00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:56.990
they wouldn't work so well
with my body. Good need

159
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.080
sleep or are pretty much
I could not function on

160
00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:03.350
the meds. So I've done
a lot of behavior therapy

161
00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:07.520
for many, many, many years.
For me, it's actually turned

162
00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.440
out to be an advantage.
Cause if you have a

163
00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:12.860
large amount of energy and
you learn how to focus

164
00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:16.130
it, which is very difficult.
But once you do, you

165
00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:18.980
do have an advantage because
you have all that energy

166
00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:23.420
that you can actually use
for something productive. Interesting. And

167
00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:26.720
then you have a number
of obsessions and I don't

168
00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:29.330
think you would mind me
using that word. You, you

169
00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:33.440
are very physical, physical trainer.
And you, you mentioned to

170
00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.570
me that you train as
much as 10 or even

171
00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:39.650
14, 15 hours a week.
Yes I do. So you're

172
00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:43.310
doing hardcore training and, and
one of the things that

173
00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:45.860
strikes me and does it
strikes people about your blog

174
00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:49.790
is that you often draw
a parallel between something that

175
00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:52.550
you're doing as far as
working out and something that

176
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:57.590
you're doing in, in software?
Yeah. Well, for me, it's,

177
00:10:57.610 --> 00:11:01.460
it's kind of, it's the
find some similarities between the

178
00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:04.640
two mindsets, you know, the
mindset one when you are

179
00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:08.570
a programmer and one you're
when you're working out it's

180
00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:13.550
because it is about development,
developing yourself, developing code, developing

181
00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:17.090
your body. And it's, I
think it's, it's a good

182
00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:21.950
way to describe problems and
solutions. And it's interesting that

183
00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:25.550
makes me wonder why more
programmers don't see that parallel.

184
00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:27.500
I mean, it seems so
obvious when you say it

185
00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:31.700
that, you know, good input
in gets you good input

186
00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:35.240
out and programmers will put
a lot of work into

187
00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:38.480
making code. Perfect. So that
when they put good things

188
00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.790
in good things come out,
but they might do that.

189
00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:44.420
Well, drinking mountain, Dew and
Fritos, you know, in the

190
00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:49.580
basement. Yeah. Oh, I do
that sometimes, but it'll probably

191
00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:54.880
be a diet Coke. I
think sometimes people get so

192
00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:58.240
comfortable in what they're doing.
And sometimes also so scared

193
00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:01.450
to, to do something else.
One thing I've really noticed,

194
00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:04.780
and especially the latest week
with all the craziness on

195
00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:11.590
Twitter, started to get also
negative emails and comments and

196
00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:15.160
things like that. And there
is, there, there is, there

197
00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.050
seems to me that like,
there is a lot of

198
00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:19.900
people who are very scared
of things that are new

199
00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:23.230
and different and it's so
easy to find that one

200
00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:26.020
thing or that few things
that you are really good

201
00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:28.540
at and you just grab
it and you just hold

202
00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:31.810
on for dear life and
you just don't want to

203
00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:34.750
step out of the box,
you know? Cause you think,

204
00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:37.900
you know, I haven't been
working out every my life.

205
00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:40.870
I can't go to the
gym and you know, compete

206
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:45.220
with everybody else there. But
that would be like me

207
00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:48.550
thinking the same a year
ago. Look, I've never, ever

208
00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:51.700
even seen code in my
life. Does that mean I'm

209
00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:55.240
never going to be able
to become a programmer? I

210
00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:59.070
disagree. That's one of the
things that is a little

211
00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:02.640
bit tricky right now is
that more and more people

212
00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:05.760
are good at programming. People
have been doing it for

213
00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:09.390
a long time. There's a
lot more things to know.

214
00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:12.570
So while you can't be
an expert at everything, you

215
00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:16.050
can certainly specialize. So, you
know, five, 10 years ago,

216
00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.810
there weren't any Ruby programmers.
And now there are Ruby

217
00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:23.160
experts and Ruby rockstars and
things like that. Do you

218
00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:25.770
find when you kind of
look at the sum total

219
00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:28.500
of all the things that
you don't know, and when

220
00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:30.600
you look at all of
the people in the community,

221
00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:33.630
do you feel overwhelmed? Like
sometimes I feel like I'm

222
00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:35.010
never going to be able
to be good at this.

223
00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:39.990
Cause there's just too many
things to know. Sometimes I

224
00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:44.070
get overwhelmed. One of the
first projects here at work,

225
00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:47.460
I was really overwhelmed because
I was working with a

226
00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:51.630
very, very good programmer. And
I just, I honestly, I

227
00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:56.310
didn't understand anything. I was
completely lost. I was very

228
00:13:56.310 --> 00:14:01.650
overwhelmed, but I do remember
something I was told on

229
00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:04.070
my first day of school,
I was told by a

230
00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:08.310
person working there and he
said, the problem is that

231
00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:10.950
often with girls, cause we
were discussing why there were

232
00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:14.040
so few female programmers. He
said, when a guy learns

233
00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:16.230
something and he learns a
little bit, he'll go like,

234
00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.720
Oh God, I'm the greatest
person in the world. I

235
00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:21.870
know everything. But when a
girl learns something, she just

236
00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:24.510
look at it and then
she look at everything else

237
00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:26.970
she does know. And she'll
say, Oh no, I'm not

238
00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:29.490
good enough because I don't
know all this and all

239
00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:32.940
that. And that actually stuck
with me because I have

240
00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:35.730
kind of sometimes been thinking
like that. I'll just focus

241
00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:39.330
on everything else that is
left to learn. So what

242
00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:42.000
I did, I just decided
to, you know what, I'm

243
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
going to be just as
proud of my hello world.

244
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.200
As whenever somebody allows me
to touch a large distributed

245
00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:52.310
system, you know, I'm going
to be happy for every

246
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:55.700
little thing I learn and
hopefully I'll manage to catch

247
00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:59.860
up. If not, I don't
care. Well, that's definitely the

248
00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:03.010
right attitude. It makes me
wonder why more people don't

249
00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:06.130
have that kind of attitude.
There's a, there's a self

250
00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:08.020
esteem there that I think
that a lot of people

251
00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:11.260
don't have. I did a
blog post a while back

252
00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:15.730
about being a phony. You're
familiar with that term. Yeah.

253
00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:18.670
And, and a lot of
people feel like that. And

254
00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:22.330
people were surprised when I
did that blog post that

255
00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.210
I felt like a phony
sometimes that, you know, sometimes

256
00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:28.060
you just don't know something
or you, you know, you

257
00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:30.550
go on vacation for a
month and some new thing

258
00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:33.340
or new pattern or new
library comes out. And then

259
00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:38.320
you're like, Oh man, I'm
just barely hanging on. But,

260
00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:41.080
but I can do hello
world. And that's more than

261
00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:42.880
some people can do and
I can do, you know,

262
00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:46.240
fizz buzz or whatever, the
new interview question that people

263
00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:48.130
are doing right now. And
it sounds like you have

264
00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:52.090
a healthy attitude. Oh, thank
you. I have to say,

265
00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:54.340
I just said there's been
a lot of good support

266
00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:59.350
in the community, but now
for the people listening, I

267
00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:04.120
just easy on the pressure,
you know? Cause everybody's so

268
00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:07.990
keen on giving advice, that
advice turns into rules. A

269
00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:12.220
good programmer does that. Good
programmer does this. And you

270
00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:15.040
just get more and more
and more and more rules

271
00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:19.450
to follow. And that is
that's when I get overwhelmed

272
00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:22.900
with all the rules, it's
a lot to know to

273
00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:27.370
take in. Yeah. Yeah. I
think that, I think they

274
00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:32.980
like that though. You said
advice turns into rules. I

275
00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:37.300
think that the programmers remember
that programmers as a job,

276
00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:41.800
our job is to make
declarative statements and we make

277
00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:45.970
them in code and they
compile and they work. So

278
00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:49.420
it's unfortunate that we'll take
those declarative statements that we

279
00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:53.080
make. And then we'll just
turn them into actual declarative

280
00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:55.780
statements we'll make in life
like, you know, thou shall

281
00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:58.990
do this thou shalt do
that. So we'll be talking

282
00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:04.930
to other people like we
are programming them and Private,

283
00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:08.200
a private club with a
certain set of rules and

284
00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:12.940
also expected behavior. Like, look,
I've, I've read a couple

285
00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:18.160
of the books, clean coder
and all those pragmatic programmer

286
00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:20.230
and they're really good books.
But if you want to

287
00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:22.480
read something, that's going to
give you really bad self

288
00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:27.250
esteem. Those books might help
a little bit. Cause unfortunately

289
00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.650
they're supposed, I think they're
supposed to give a lot

290
00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:33.730
of good advice, but as,
especially as a newbie or

291
00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:36.550
just a person just starting
out with programming, when you

292
00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:39.130
read those, you kind of
feel like you have to

293
00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:42.880
do it now and that's
everybody's doing it. And if

294
00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:46.690
you don't, you're not good
enough. I kind of learned

295
00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:51.570
that there are there it's
advice and I think it's

296
00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:54.390
an ideal world and it's
great if you get there,

297
00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:57.140
but you don't suck. You
don't. Well, what do you

298
00:17:57.140 --> 00:18:00.020
think that the community needs
to do differently to make

299
00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:03.020
things more friendly for, for
newbies? I mean not every

300
00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:05.930
newbie has been programming a
year has got a job

301
00:18:06.170 --> 00:18:10.400
and you've accomplished that nor
have they been on Twitter

302
00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:15.410
and been, been loud on
Twitter. And there may, there

303
00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:17.480
may be a thousand newbies
that are listening to this

304
00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:21.050
that feel overwhelmed and like
they're, they don't have anything

305
00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:24.050
to say, but you put
a blog up and you

306
00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:26.060
actually have a series in
your blog that I find

307
00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:29.300
really interesting where you're actually
asking stupid questions and you

308
00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:33.650
actually came out and called
them stupid questions. What do

309
00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:35.660
you tell the community about,
about how to make things

310
00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:38.600
more friendly to, to newbies,
especially ones who aren't as

311
00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:42.620
forward as you are? Well,
I would say they have

312
00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:47.390
to show more acceptance because
it is, they have to

313
00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:49.700
show more acceptance. Cause they're
also, there is also the

314
00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:53.660
stigma that you have to
act and be like a

315
00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:56.840
nurse to be accepted in
the community. And I own,

316
00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:59.540
honestly, I'll say now I
have no idea. If I'm

317
00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:02.000
a nerd, I like fashion
like makeup and I like

318
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.790
high heels and I like
working out. I like cooking

319
00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:08.450
and traveling and I'm not
sure if I would call

320
00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:10.910
myself a nerd and I
don't think that should matter.

321
00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:13.840
There's a lot of, there's
a lot of this oldest

322
00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:17.150
rules making it really hard
for new programmers. If they

323
00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:19.400
feel like it don't fit
in what I went to

324
00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:21.620
school, one of the person
in my class, he was

325
00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:24.710
a chef. We had a
chemist and we have people

326
00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:28.970
who have been working with
completely different things. And I

327
00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:32.240
reckon still they're quite good
programmers today on they'll get

328
00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:36.380
even better, but it's so
important to feel like you

329
00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:39.260
belong. And one, all these
rules exist, the power you

330
00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:42.380
have to behave and have
you, how you have to

331
00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:45.320
act and talk and all
that. If you feel like

332
00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:47.810
you don't fit in, then
you kind of, you know,

333
00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:51.320
you remove yourself from that
community with time and that's

334
00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:54.920
actually, that's a big loss
for the community. Yeah, I

335
00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:57.770
think you're right. I wonder
how many people we've lost

336
00:19:57.890 --> 00:20:02.540
through negativity or lack of
openness. And I also worry

337
00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:06.950
about, about women or people
who aren't just your average,

338
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:10.850
you know, middle aged man.
There are a lot of

339
00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:15.200
women out there who don't
use their pictures as their

340
00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:19.760
avatars. They use a name.
That's not their real name

341
00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:23.660
because it's such a, it's
such a negative community towards

342
00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:28.190
anyone who's different. Yes it
is. And I actually, I

343
00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:32.840
was thinking about that latest
yesterday. I have no idea

344
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:38.060
what to do. Should I,
should I just focus on

345
00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:42.500
my programming skills or can
I allow my personality and

346
00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:46.070
me as a person to
be included? Because I think

347
00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:48.610
how I am a program
or a big part of

348
00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:51.310
it is how I am
as a person. That is

349
00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:54.100
my selling point. Not just
the code. I don't want

350
00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:57.490
to be reduced just to
code, but it seems like

351
00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:01.720
I won't get the respect
of the community unless I

352
00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:06.660
do jail staff. Is that
true? It depends on who

353
00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:09.750
you're hanging out with. You
know, there are, there are

354
00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:11.730
clubs and there are groups
that like things to be

355
00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:14.670
a certain way. But I
like to think of the

356
00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:18.480
community as being a meritocracy.
You know, I mean they

357
00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:21.960
say, talk is cheap. Show
me the code. You know,

358
00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:24.870
if you might, you might
start, let's be honest. You

359
00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:28.470
might start out as an
oddity. People might say, Hey,

360
00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:32.430
she's, she's dyed her hair
bright red. And she's a,

361
00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:35.610
she's a woman and she
works out. So here's three

362
00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:40.530
things that make you different
than the typical, hopefully being

363
00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:42.810
a woman will be the
least of those things. That's

364
00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:48.390
strange, you know, and people
will, they might fo follow

365
00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:50.460
you. And I don't necessarily
mean follow you on Twitter,

366
00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:53.400
but follow you in your
career initially. Cause like, Oh,

367
00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:58.830
here's an interesting woman. And
then you'll immediately hopefully raise

368
00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:01.650
the discourse to an intellectual
one. And people will forget

369
00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:05.010
that, Oh, by the way,
Iris is a woman, but

370
00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:07.770
what have you read her
blog? And the woman thing

371
00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:10.830
I would hope would fall
away. There's always the a

372
00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:13.080
there's the old internet joke
that on the internet, no

373
00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:15.780
one knows that you're a
dog. You know, you, you

374
00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:19.680
might be like an actual
canine, but as long as

375
00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:22.890
you can code and your
pull request compiles, it doesn't

376
00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:29.580
really matter. So if one
chooses to flaunt, isn't the

377
00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:32.970
right word. But to, to
emphasize some aspect about them,

378
00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:35.820
then they will, you know,
they are controlling their personal

379
00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:38.970
brand. Like I could have
hidden the fact that I'm

380
00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:42.840
diabetic. I know people who
have hidden that for various

381
00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:45.780
personal reasons, but it's who
I, as a part of

382
00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:49.530
who I am. And if
I had done that, maybe

383
00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:52.140
people would have treated me
different in some jobs, but

384
00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:56.640
I wouldn't have gotten involved
in healthcare coding and medical

385
00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:00.600
device, you know, organizations and
things like that. If you

386
00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:05.790
hit your fitness, a penchant,
then you might not get

387
00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:07.590
an offer at some point
in the future to work

388
00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:10.980
on fitness software. Or if
you decided to, instead of

389
00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:14.490
being Iris with a Iris
avatar, you could have just

390
00:23:14.490 --> 00:23:17.280
become a Simpsons character and
never said a word about

391
00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:22.740
your, your location or your
nationality or your interests. Well,

392
00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:27.720
I want to have a
face. I don't want to

393
00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:30.360
be a celebrity, but I
want to have a face.

394
00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:34.230
And because I believe like
a lot of especially young

395
00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:37.110
women who want to learn
programming want to become a

396
00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:40.770
programmer, what, who are they
supposed to turn to? Where

397
00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:44.340
can they find somebody to?
Where can they find the

398
00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:47.750
friends you? So I want
to have a face. Cause

399
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:50.300
I reckon I'm strong enough
to take, you know, take

400
00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:53.660
the crap that might come
with having a face with

401
00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:58.760
my COVID has a face
for the cold should. I'm

402
00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:02.260
hoping will be a top
notch quality, but I want

403
00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:04.630
to, I think that's great.
I think that I have

404
00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:07.330
a feeling that that will
be the line out of

405
00:24:07.330 --> 00:24:09.550
this podcast that people will
remember because I think you're

406
00:24:09.550 --> 00:24:12.280
right. The code should stand
on its own. But when

407
00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:15.250
someone digs behind it to
find out that person they'll

408
00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:19.900
find a person with diverse
interests and a diverse personality

409
00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:23.020
and that isn't simply, Oh,
a woman wrote this or

410
00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:28.030
Oh, someone with red hair
wrote this or whatever. Look

411
00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:33.400
somebody with green short hair.
Yes, no judging. And why

412
00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:35.560
was it? I was at
Oz con. I was at

413
00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:38.140
Oz con the opensource conference
recently. And I think there

414
00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:40.180
were more people with purple
and blue hair than there

415
00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:43.030
were people with real hair.
So I think that there's

416
00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:45.280
nothing, nothing against people who
color their hair purple or

417
00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:50.140
whatever. No, because, because it's
cool. Look, it was cool

418
00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:53.680
when I was 40 and,
and I reckon it's really

419
00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:56.440
cool. Now, Why do you,
did you go and get

420
00:24:56.470 --> 00:25:00.490
a software engineering degree or
is this all still still

421
00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:05.980
self-taught? Well, we have, we
have different types of schools

422
00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:09.130
in, in Sweden. This type
is actually more of a

423
00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:14.830
practical training. It's a two
year school and I went

424
00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:18.070
the first year. I won't
do the second year. I'll

425
00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:20.620
just do the exams, but
I won't tend to attend

426
00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:24.340
the lectures as I've already
gone through the material that

427
00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:27.670
we'll be doing the next
year. It's been a, it's

428
00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:30.400
been a very good school,
then I've enjoyed it very

429
00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:32.530
much. And I've learned as
much as I could from

430
00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:36.850
there. And, but a lot
I had to do on

431
00:25:36.850 --> 00:25:40.960
my own. So you still
have to do your own

432
00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:46.030
studies next to school, everybody.
I think everybody knows Your

433
00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:51.010
previous education was in nutrition
and specifically clinical nutrition. I'm

434
00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:52.540
sure that you went to
school for that, but then

435
00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:55.120
also did studying on the
side. What do you think

436
00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:57.760
about the balance that one
needs to find between a

437
00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:01.750
formal education and an ongoing
education that you, you learn

438
00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:05.410
on your own at home?
I think the most important

439
00:26:05.410 --> 00:26:09.850
is you have to have
that real passion. The moment

440
00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:13.900
you think I should, or
someone you feel, you feel

441
00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:16.840
like you have to do
it and you remove the,

442
00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:19.300
I want to do it.
That's when you're going to

443
00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:22.810
struggle. And the hard part
about studying on your own

444
00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:25.510
is you have to have
discipline because nobody's going to

445
00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:29.590
expect anything from you. It's
just you, the books or

446
00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:31.990
the tools you choose to
use, but it's just, you,

447
00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:35.110
you have to make yourself
proud. Nobody's gonna, you know,

448
00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:38.140
clap their hands once you're
done with it. So you

449
00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:40.450
won't get the grad, you
won't get anything you might

450
00:26:40.450 --> 00:26:42.760
even miss out or some
sleep. You just have to

451
00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:45.300
find the pride in what
you are doing for yourself.

452
00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:47.690
Drive come from though. I
think a lot of people

453
00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:51.080
after a few years in
the business get pretty tired

454
00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:52.940
and I I've talked to
a number of programmers that

455
00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:55.100
are burned out and you've
only been doing this a

456
00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:59.090
year. I've been doing this
almost 20. And I admit

457
00:26:59.450 --> 00:27:02.480
to being very tired sometimes.
And I wouldn't mind going

458
00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:05.390
and becoming a clinical nutrition
person and a fitness person

459
00:27:05.570 --> 00:27:07.250
and you can have my
job. You know what I

460
00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:09.170
mean? Like how do you
know you're going to be

461
00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:12.250
this excited in a year
or 10 years? I don't

462
00:27:12.250 --> 00:27:15.740
know because I've spent most
of my life being very

463
00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:20.030
unhappy, being very miserable and
just hating everything with my

464
00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:25.070
life and myself. Didn't actually
didn't even want to live.

465
00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:28.220
I just, I was in
a very, very dark place

466
00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:32.360
for very, very many years.
And once I saw the

467
00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:34.340
light at the end of
the tunnel and I managed

468
00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:37.100
to pull through, I just
realize how many years I've

469
00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:39.350
lost. And I just feel
like how a lot of

470
00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:43.250
catching up to do. And
I've wasted too much time

471
00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:46.630
on that. So it's, it's
time to be happy, passionate,

472
00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:49.850
and enjoy life and all
the possibilities I get. Now

473
00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:53.120
I wasted so many years
and I can't afford to

474
00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:56.750
do that again. Cause you
never know how life's going

475
00:27:56.750 --> 00:28:00.080
to turn out. You know
what the end will be,

476
00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:02.660
but you don't know how
long it's going to take

477
00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:06.140
until you get there. My
dad always, I don't know.

478
00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:07.490
I don't know if your
dad is the same way,

479
00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:09.530
but fathers always have these
three or four things that

480
00:28:09.530 --> 00:28:12.780
they say constantly like these,
say these saying for the,

481
00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:15.020
for the last 40 years,
my dad has always said,

482
00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:18.710
whenever we talk about life,
he says, you know, none

483
00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:23.240
of us are getting out
of this alive. Oh, it's

484
00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:27.340
true. It's true. Everybody's dying.
Just some of us said,

485
00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:30.170
don't have a diagnosis. You
know, we're all dying some

486
00:28:30.170 --> 00:28:34.730
way or the other. Well,
that's a depressing thought really,

487
00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:38.180
but we want to end
on that. What to do

488
00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:40.910
as a community, to get
women and children more involved

489
00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:42.620
in computers. I've had a
couple of people on the

490
00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:47.330
show. We've talked to some
organizations like black girls code

491
00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:49.460
that are focused on not
only women, but women of

492
00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:52.850
color. What, what, what do
we need to do to

493
00:28:52.850 --> 00:28:56.960
get young women to not
think that this is, you

494
00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:59.090
know, a bad job? I
think it's a pretty cool

495
00:28:59.090 --> 00:29:01.130
job. We need to catch
them when they're 12 years

496
00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:04.460
old, not when they're maybe
not when they're 30. Well,

497
00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:06.800
I say it's the best
job in the world. We

498
00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:10.760
have to be more supportive
and less judgemental. I think

499
00:29:10.910 --> 00:29:15.740
those two things are very,
very, very important. There is

500
00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:20.240
a certain form of elitism
in all this people who've

501
00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:24.620
worked really hard to get
where they are, might sometimes

502
00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:30.740
forgets that they also were
updates zero once. So let's

503
00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:34.640
never, ever, ever forget that
we all have written or

504
00:29:34.670 --> 00:29:39.650
hello world and secretly, it
was really, really happy about

505
00:29:39.650 --> 00:29:43.780
it. So let's not forget
that it used to be

506
00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:47.290
a big thing when we
started out at well, for

507
00:29:47.290 --> 00:29:50.200
me, it still is. Cause
I'm just starting out, but

508
00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:54.040
we must not forget that
and understand that they need,

509
00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:58.140
they need their cheerleaders and
we're supposed to be. That's

510
00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:00.030
great. I appreciate that. Well,
thank you so much for

511
00:30:00.030 --> 00:30:03.570
talking to me today. Yeah,
no thank you for calling

512
00:30:03.570 --> 00:30:07.950
me. I hope I gave
you some good answers. No,

513
00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:10.590
there's a lot of really
great, interesting information here and

514
00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:14.430
