Scott talks with Brad Wilson

9
00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.970
about using windows eight. Hi,
this is Scott Hanselman. This

10
00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.070
is another episode of Hansel
minutes. And today I'm talking

11
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.430
to my buddy, Brad Wilson.
How are you, sir? I

12
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.880
am awesome. How are you?
Well, I am I'm, I've

13
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.530
upgraded to windows eight, so
I don't know how that

14
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.830
makes me, that makes me,
that makes me a person

15
00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.820
that just couldn't help himself
yesterday. It was about, I

16
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.410
don't know, two or three,
and I was working on

17
00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.160
some stuff and I said,
you know, I have, I

18
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.790
have my windows seven desktop,
the ultimate, the ultimate developer

19
00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.050
PC. I remember the one
that I made with, with

20
00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.800
Jeff Atwood. And this is
the one where I'm actually

21
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.200
running your 30 inch monitor.
This is the monitor that

22
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:43.520
you sold me. Why did
I, why did you sell

23
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.040
me this monitor? You bought
a better one. I bought

24
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.000
a 27 inch iMac. Oh,
I remember. Okay. All in

25
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.790
one, all one monitor and
computer. Exactly. Okay. So I'm

26
00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.280
running your 30 inch monitor
and then I've got my

27
00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.100
24 and my 27 next
to it. And I had

28
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.570
been not upgrading to windows
eight, simply because it seemed

29
00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.240
like it didn't make any
sense for a multiple monitor

30
00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.280
machine. But you know, for
some reason I always upgrade

31
00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.510
to a new operating systems
when there's like a no

32
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.880
reason to do it other
than it's new and shiny

33
00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.840
or B there's some important
work that needs to be

34
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.740
done the next day. So
clearly I take a break

35
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.770
from that important work and
then upgrade my entire operating

36
00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:37.400
system until work needs to
be done. Then I end

37
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:43.310
up, I seem to remember
upgrading to windows 3.1, like

38
00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.130
the night before the SATs.
You know what I mean?

39
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.810
It's like, Oh, it's just,
I'll take a small break

40
00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.020
here. Like somewhere in like
1990 or something like that.

41
00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.510
I'll take a break and
install a beta operating system,

42
00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.290
a tiny bit of procrastination
in your blood. Yeah. And

43
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.440
then inevitably that will destroy
the world and destroy my

44
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.400
computer and I'll lose everything.
But how long have you

45
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.680
been running windows eight? Since
about the time of the

46
00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:16.830
first build conference last October.
Yeah, absolutely. I started running

47
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.900
that version. I had, I
guess it was on a,

48
00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.150
on one of my laptops
to start with, but then

49
00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.660
not long after that, I
bought the Samsung slate, which

50
00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.820
is the commercial version of
the thing they gave away

51
00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.340
at build. And I've been
running windows eight on that

52
00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.460
ever since. I mean, it
showed up with windows seven

53
00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.710
and it immediately got obliterated
to put windows eight on

54
00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:41.490
it. Cause why would you
buy this nice, shiny touch

55
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.100
thing and not put windows
eight on it? I wouldn't

56
00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.830
know. You paid your own
money for it. Cause we

57
00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.750
didn't get, Yeah, I paid
my own money on sale,

58
00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.030
Christina. There was a nice
Christmas sale to Microsoft store.

59
00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.450
Wow. Okay. That's hardcore. I
didn't realize, I thought you

60
00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.090
only been running it for
a couple of weeks. Nope.

61
00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.570
While I've at home, I've
been running it on the

62
00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.280
slate, which is kind of
like a home PC that

63
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.050
I take to work at
home. I still, you know,

64
00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:14.130
the MSDN stuff just came
out yesterday. Cause we're talking

65
00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.770
about this on August 16th. So
it just came out yesterday.

66
00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:20.100
So this weekend I will
upgrade my gaming PC, which

67
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.290
has been the one that
I'm always reluctant to do

68
00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.310
because it's, you know, I
always feel stimulate gaming is

69
00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.510
this thing that makes PCs
very touchy. And so any

70
00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:35.430
change seems bad. Yeah. Yeah.
Actually I, I tried to

71
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.850
run Diablo yesterday and it
told me that it thought

72
00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.310
that my video card was
out of date and I

73
00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.800
thought that was a very
kind of dramatic message. And

74
00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.560
it's like, Oh Lord, here
I am running some two

75
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.860
year old video card driver.
And it was from March.

76
00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.100
I'm like really? When did
a five month old video

77
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:58.170
driver become incredibly old and
dangerous to run? Well, apparently

78
00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.640
they've been releasing drivers like
madman trying to sort of

79
00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.950
get ready for windows eight.
So I would imagine that's

80
00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:08.760
why it's out of date.
So should I just upgrade?

81
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.920
I mean, should I get,
get the new drivers? I

82
00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.320
mean, would it, would it
be presumptive? I can install

83
00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:17.280
windows seven drivers on windows
eight, Right? You can install

84
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.460
windows seven drivers. I'm assuming
you're using one of Nvidia

85
00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.910
or ATI and they both
have windows eight drivers. Although

86
00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.240
I think they consider them
to be beta drivers, but

87
00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.840
they have, they have drivers
for windows eight. And in

88
00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.610
addition to the ones that
are in the box, you

89
00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.620
know, it depends on how
new your video card is.

90
00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.200
Whether or not there's an
inbox driver. Cause I know

91
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.690
some of the really old
cards they used to be

92
00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.690
like the old direct X
nine cards don't have drivers

93
00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:45.210
because of course windows eight
wants you to have direct

94
00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.490
X 10. So, So what
is that you just said,

95
00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.030
inbox drivers will tell, tell
the listeners what an inbox

96
00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:53.010
driver is and why I
should and how I would

97
00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:55.530
make a decision based on
an inbox driver versus non.

98
00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.050
When I use The phrase
inbox driver, what I mean

99
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.380
is the driver that comes
with windows eight. So there'll

100
00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:07.220
be drivers for a whole
variety of hardware devices that

101
00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:09.320
ship along with windows eight.
So you don't have to

102
00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.110
download anything. You don't have
to run anybody's install CD.

103
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:15.590
The stuff will just be
there. Video drivers are kind

104
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:17.720
of the weird one for
me because you always feel

105
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.050
like, you know, Hey, I
could get 3% more performance.

106
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:23.600
If I go grab the
driver, you know, the latest

107
00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:27.380
driver off of the manufacturer's
website. So, but other than

108
00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:30.450
that, I generally run with
the driver that comes with

109
00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:33.350
the iOS if it supports
it. So, you know, I

110
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:36.740
don't install a custom sound
car. Drivers are custom chips

111
00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.930
that drivers or anything like
that. If everything's kind of

112
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.090
supported out of the box,
then I just leave it

113
00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:44.020
alone. So those, so drivers
like that, if I can

114
00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:48.490
get a windows installation to
run without installing drivers, then

115
00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:52.360
presumably that that's going to
be a more, a more

116
00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:56.440
stable system or the most
stable system possible. Right now,

117
00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:59.020
the one thing it's kind
of odd with video drivers

118
00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.390
in particular with windows eight,
you might not realize you're

119
00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:05.800
running a less than optimal
driver is the, the sort

120
00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.710
of builtin base driver, which
I think they call Microsoft

121
00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:12.550
base video. Now actually we'll
run, you know, the full

122
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:14.920
resolution of your monitor. You
should be able to tell

123
00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:17.890
that, Hey, I'm running the
builtin video driver and not

124
00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:20.740
the real one, cause it's
running me at 10 24

125
00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:24.490
or something like that. But
the builtin driver will run

126
00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:27.670
pretty much anything your graphics
card can do and your

127
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:31.450
monitor can do it just
won't necessarily be hardware accelerated.

128
00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:34.240
So you do have to
kind of look and check

129
00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.090
to make sure that it's
when you look inside of

130
00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:40.300
device manager, that it says,
you know, yeah, my video

131
00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:42.790
card is an Nvidia or
an HCI or an Intel

132
00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:44.830
or whatever it is you
have as opposed to the

133
00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:48.640
Microsoft based video driver. Hmm.
Okay. So I just I'm

134
00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.250
clicking around here and I
just checked, it says my

135
00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:56.170
Nvidia GTX four 70 is
running. It says, it says

136
00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:59.800
Nvidia. And then it says
Microsoft corporation. So it's actually

137
00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:04.360
saying that windows, Sorry. That
means you're running. The driver

138
00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:09.640
that came in windows. It
was written are certified by

139
00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:14.230
us basically. Okay. But then
it also says WDM, which

140
00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:17.470
I think is like windows
device driver model, but it

141
00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:23.770
says WDM 1.2. And that
makes me feel like maybe

142
00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:27.430
that's isn't there a 1.3
that might be oldish. So

143
00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:29.260
I might be running the
ones that came with windows

144
00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:33.610
seven and then I upgrade
The WDM came about in

145
00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:37.150
Vista. And so when you
see WDM 1.0, that's a

146
00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:41.950
Vista era driver and WDM
1.1 is a windows seven

147
00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:45.070
era driver. And 1.2 is
a windows eight era driver.

148
00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:48.700
So I am, I do
have new stuff then. Yeah,

149
00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:51.280
you do have the new
stuff. Okay. So I've got

150
00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:53.980
the newest inbox drivers. So
I've got the drivers that

151
00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:58.740
came with windows and presumably
for doing work about, you

152
00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:01.140
know, desktop work and running
around this will be fine.

153
00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:02.970
But if I want to
get the new stuff, I

154
00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:06.780
would in the upgrade and
get the beta drivers. But

155
00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:08.310
these are done looking at
the beta drivers here and

156
00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:11.040
it says June 27th for Nvidia.
So I should probably I'm

157
00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.290
think I'll probably wait a
couple of months for a

158
00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:15.930
released version of a driver
from Nvidia. And that would

159
00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:20.580
give me, you know, X
number of percentage, more umph

160
00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:25.430
in Diablo or whatever I
presume It will also give

161
00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:29.230
you more options like a
Nvidia and ATI, both shipped

162
00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:33.230
with special applications that when
you right click, you got

163
00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:35.330
like the hanging out the
Nvidia control panel or the

164
00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:38.450
HCI command center or whatever
they call it. And so

165
00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:41.540
running their drivers might give
you additional software options as

166
00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:44.330
well. The video drivers that
come with windows eight are

167
00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:48.590
probably, you know, they're good
for the stuff that's built

168
00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:50.150
into windows eight, but they
might not have any of

169
00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:52.820
the advanced tweaking you could
do with the custom driver.

170
00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:57.110
Okay. That makes sense. Yeah.
When I installed a windows

171
00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:59.390
eight, I kind of thought
about just like, cause I

172
00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:01.580
upgraded, I did actually I
did two installs. So my

173
00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:05.960
desk, my desktop, I upgraded
from windows seven, my laptop,

174
00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:08.450
I torched it because I
just wanted it to be

175
00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:12.320
super fresh. Interestingly on my
desktop, which was an upgrade,

176
00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.920
I only had 20 gigs
of a hard drive left.

177
00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:18.920
I did the upgrade and
then I ran disk cleanup

178
00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:24.590
and I have 65 gigs
left. So something fresh happened

179
00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:26.690
during the upgrade. I don't
know if they cleaned up

180
00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:29.240
the side by side folders
or something, but I ended

181
00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:32.210
up with 40 gigs, more
space than I had when

182
00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:36.500
I was done. So when
I went through what I

183
00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:39.170
did right before I upgraded,
I said to myself, what

184
00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:42.320
kind of controversial things are
running in the tray? You

185
00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:45.560
know what I mean? I
thought about like, you know,

186
00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:50.930
DVD drivers and magic ISO,
which is a ISO mounting

187
00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:56.570
thing and anything I thought
that would make it unstable.

188
00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:59.800
You know, it's kind of
like preempting the little, the

189
00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.600
little thing that would say
you really shouldn't be running

190
00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.730
this. You should turn it
off for now while you

191
00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:07.310
do the upgrade. You know,
stuff that I knew would

192
00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:11.360
be a bad idea. And
once I did that, I

193
00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:14.450
didn't end up with any,
anything. It didn't complain about

194
00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:17.690
any of my software, which
I thought was cool. Yeah.

195
00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:22.100
I've found most, everything is
pretty compatible. The magic ISO

196
00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:24.920
one is interesting because there's
ISO mounting in the box.

197
00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:26.960
And what does eight now?
So you don't have to

198
00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:29.690
have any custom software for
that. Yeah. So I can

199
00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:33.170
just double click on an
ISO or actually a VHD

200
00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:36.320
and Mount it directly without
him do anything. They just

201
00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:39.260
show up as files and
explore. And there's a, you

202
00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.000
click on them and there's
a Mt menu in the

203
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.310
year. You go off and
do your thing. So that

204
00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:46.280
worked really well. What else
do I have to tell

205
00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:47.900
with? Well, one of the
things that I thought was

206
00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:51.320
kind of cool was actually
I joked about this with

207
00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:54.580
a buddy of mine saying
that even though Metro or

208
00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:58.060
not, Metro, whatever we call
it now windows store thing,

209
00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:04.510
windows, tile, and box applications
are even though they are

210
00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:08.830
dramatic and that the start
menu is gone, the, the

211
00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:12.130
task manager is a good
enough reason to upgrade. Like

212
00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:16.150
literally the, the task manager,
which I ended up keeping

213
00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:18.970
open on another monitor all
the time anyway is so

214
00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:21.550
much more useful now that
you might as well just

215
00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:23.470
upgrade your entire operating system
to get a better task

216
00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:27.250
manager. It has a startup
tab. Now, have you seen

217
00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:31.030
this? I've seen a little
bit of it. So if

218
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:33.190
you go to the startup
tab, there is a new,

219
00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:39.550
a new column called startup
impact. And it tells you

220
00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:43.390
whether or not the application
will slow down your applications,

221
00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:47.440
your, your windows rebooting. You
should do that right now,

222
00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:53.930
actually, you know, you're in
front of your machine, Microsoft.

223
00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:56.540
Right? Right. So then look
at all the software. I

224
00:12:56.550 --> 00:13:00.750
feel like it says Google
drive is high startup impact.

225
00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:04.170
So that's cool. So I
just disable, I right. Click

226
00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:11.580
disable that Dropbox. Okay. That
makes sense. Skype was slowing

227
00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:14.280
down my machine. So there's
lots of different pieces of

228
00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:17.580
software that have been warning
me. Like for example, I

229
00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:19.140
don't know if it's a
windows eight thing. It's probably

230
00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:24.810
an office thing, but outlook
earlier today said, there's an

231
00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:28.770
add in that's making outlook
start slowly. I was like,

232
00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:30.420
Oh, that's awesome. So it
says, you want to take

233
00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:33.750
this, add in that, that,
that added one second of

234
00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:36.630
time to your, your outlook
running. And do you want

235
00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:39.550
to slow it down and
turn it off? And then

236
00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:41.340
the same thing happened in,
I E remember I nine

237
00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:44.310
at that feature I learned,
I launched E and I

238
00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:48.780
says, this one ad and
you have, is making it

239
00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:52.350
take an extra second to
load. So I disabled Java

240
00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:58.440
and one other, one other
add on. So kind of

241
00:13:58.440 --> 00:13:59.820
like that, that seems to
be the new thing is

242
00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:03.240
to have software tell you
that some other software, you

243
00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:09.360
know, is slowing down Tired
of getting blamed for like,

244
00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:11.220
Oh man, I don't look
at sofa now. It's not

245
00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:14.880
really outlook. It's that indexing
add on you. That's interesting

246
00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:17.250
because visual studio does that
now outlook does it windows

247
00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:19.170
it. And they're all just
basically saying it's not our

248
00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:21.990
fault is that the it's
not our fault feature. And

249
00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:26.460
apparently it must be. I
like that. So you've been

250
00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:28.920
running this way longer than
I have. And I, I

251
00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:33.780
tweeted yesterday that I was
upgrading and I think it

252
00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:37.020
was somebody else somebody said,
well, call us in a

253
00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:40.290
week when you've used it
without a touchscreen. Cause they

254
00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:44.040
were declaring that windows eight
was unusable without a touchscreen.

255
00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:48.510
You have a touch. It
is ridiculous. Yeah. That's a

256
00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:51.650
ridiculous statement. That's a statement
by somebody who used it.

257
00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:57.550
And interesting. I, My, my
main machine at work is

258
00:14:57.550 --> 00:15:02.020
a, is a three monitor
machine running windows eight and

259
00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:04.540
no touch on any monitors.
And I love it. I

260
00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:08.650
would not go back to
windows seven at all. Really

261
00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:12.100
why? Well, so first of
all, the, the thing that

262
00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:16.390
like people say it's only
good for touch. All I

263
00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:18.700
can think is they think
that the start screen is

264
00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:21.010
a touch centric thing. It
works great with a mouse,

265
00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:23.140
all the things that I'm
used to being able to

266
00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:24.820
do with a keyboard, like
I hit the star key

267
00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:27.010
and start typing program names
and they come up. I

268
00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:28.610
like the way they come
up a lot better than

269
00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:31.360
in windows seven. I like
the start screen as an

270
00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:35.710
organization metaphor much better than
the start menu and everything

271
00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:37.930
is faster. I mean, I
know it's kind of a

272
00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:41.200
subjective measurement, but the thing
boots faster, the thing runs

273
00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:45.880
software faster. It just feels
better. It seemed on my

274
00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:48.910
laptop. I noticed that it
seems to be using the

275
00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:51.640
laptop more effectively. And I
tried to figure out why

276
00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:55.750
and saw that the virtual
memory was smaller than in

277
00:15:55.750 --> 00:16:00.700
windows seven. It automatically made
my swap file less because

278
00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:04.950
it knew I had 12
gigs of Ram because I

279
00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:07.180
know my numbers. I know
the numbers that I set

280
00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:11.980
the thing to. And somehow
those numbers changed. It seems

281
00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:14.170
to have better caching. I'm
not sure why or how.

282
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.620
Yeah. That's clearly doing, you
know, a lot better, pretty

283
00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:22.810
much every app that I
run seems to run better

284
00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:25.660
in windows eight. You know,
one thing I've noticed also

285
00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:28.990
is that they're moving towards
a kind of, it just

286
00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:31.840
works attitude. This is my
opinion. But if you go

287
00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:34.570
to the task manager by
default, it only shows one

288
00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:39.190
CPU. Like I've got six
cores and 12 logical processors.

289
00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:42.520
And I actually have to
right. Click and say change

290
00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:45.130
to logical processors. If I
want to see which processors

291
00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:51.250
being slow, are you in
task manager? So right. Click

292
00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:55.060
on CPU and say change
graph to logical processors. Yep.

293
00:16:55.500 --> 00:17:01.930
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Isn't
that cool? Yeah. There's a

294
00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:04.180
bunch of things that are
blowing me away about, about

295
00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:07.060
this as well. So one
of them, if you, if

296
00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:16.630
you, where is it view
if you right. Click, yeah,

297
00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:18.940
try this, check this out.
So the left hand side

298
00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:21.130
there, which is performance and
you've got CPU memory and

299
00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:24.610
all that stuff, right? Click
on that and say summary

300
00:17:24.610 --> 00:17:29.530
view. You see how it
collapses and makes this stack

301
00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:33.610
of little tiny spark lines.
Then you can take that

302
00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:35.710
and just shut it off
in the corner. So now

303
00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:38.380
you've get kind of like
free little spark, you know,

304
00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:41.380
active sparklines and then if
you just double click on

305
00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:43.660
any one of them, it
will show you what's going

306
00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:46.450
on and then you double
click away and it will

307
00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:49.140
collapse again. So like right
now I can see my

308
00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:52.860
C drive is working hard,
double click. Okay. And it

309
00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:57.900
says average response time, five
milliseconds. It's writing, edit a

310
00:17:57.940 --> 00:17:59.850
megabyte a second right now
and then I double click

311
00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:02.970
and then it goes away
again and that cool. That's

312
00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:06.600
pretty cool. And then if
you go to processes, check

313
00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:09.210
this out, go to processes
and then you know how

314
00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:12.750
you've got CPU and we
always sort by CPU, you

315
00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:16.050
can actually short by network
now or short by disk.

316
00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:19.290
So short by disc right
now. Okay. So here we

317
00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:22.080
go. It looks like windows
search is what's taking up

318
00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:24.570
my disc right now. So,
you know, when I heard,

319
00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:27.660
if I hear the disc,
I can't, it's an SSD,

320
00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:30.480
but theoretically, if I hear
the disc moving, I can

321
00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:33.240
say, well, wait a second,
go to task manager, sort

322
00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:35.490
by disc. I can see
that right now. My disc

323
00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:39.360
is being indexed. That's very
useful. Yeah. It's super useful.

324
00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:42.660
I think you can. Can
you, you know, I've always

325
00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:45.780
wanted to find out what
services are running. Let me

326
00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:49.080
see here. I'm going to
start by name and then

327
00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:52.680
I can go to, here
you go, service host. This

328
00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:55.050
is cool. So you see
how, what, y'all the surface

329
00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:59.640
hosts like blue, blue gears,
you open, open them up

330
00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:02.580
and you can actually see
the services now running inside

331
00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:06.330
your service host and then
right. Click on the individual

332
00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:10.590
service and stop it from
inside task manager in the

333
00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:14.650
process of, yeah. And what's
even cooler is the service

334
00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:17.720
host tells you what context
it's running in, such as

335
00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:21.800
these services are running as
local system or local service.

336
00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:24.230
So for the, for the
nerdly among us who want

337
00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:27.410
to know, you know, what
credentials is this service running

338
00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:30.530
under? You know, what can
this service actually do? Oh,

339
00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:35.960
this isn't useful information so
that when I see services,

340
00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:39.320
I see one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight,

341
00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:44.330
nine, 10 different services right
next to them. They say

342
00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:48.650
services calling local service service,
host calling local service network,

343
00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:52.490
restricted service, host, colon and
local service. No impersonation. I

344
00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:56.780
see one here that says
local service, no network. Right?

345
00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:59.240
So the things running in
there don't don't have access

346
00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:04.460
to send any network. Well,
that's cool. I also noticed

347
00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:10.340
that you've got a categorization.
So it says apps, background

348
00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:14.900
processes, and windows processes. It's
kind of like, don't mess

349
00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:18.380
with this stuff. I assume
there are differentiation there between

350
00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:20.720
an app and a background
process is whether or not

351
00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:24.590
the thing has a window.
I see, I see Google

352
00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:29.210
Chrome as an app. And
then I see like 40

353
00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:33.050
Google chromes as backdrop processes.
Right. But I see like

354
00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:37.910
Google drive and Google crashy
for Google crash handlers as

355
00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:43.520
a background process. Yeah, yeah.
Yeah. Interesting. You know, and,

356
00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:47.920
and I'm a hockey guy.
So I was really about,

357
00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:52.270
about the whole, I don't
get, I don't know what

358
00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:55.930
to call it the whole
not windows classic. I'm sure

359
00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:57.880
they'll email us and tell
us all what to say.

360
00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:01.330
I have no idea what
the, the terms are. Now.

361
00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:05.050
I know that there's that
whole Metro thing, but I

362
00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:08.250
hit window X, have you
used window X? I love

363
00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:12.780
window X. It's crazy. Because
window X was a moderately

364
00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:16.890
useful and hot key before
it would bring up the

365
00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:20.730
mobility center. And the only
purpose for window X before

366
00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:24.180
was you'd hit window X
and you'd say presenting. And

367
00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:28.230
that was the, you know,
don't fall asleep button. And

368
00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:31.560
it's helpful only for people
who are presenting or maybe

369
00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:35.280
they're going to change their,
whether they're PR whether they're

370
00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:39.000
projecting or whether they are
in a certain power mode.

371
00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:43.470
Right? Yup. Yup. But the
first kind of hour of

372
00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:46.320
using windows eight, I would
hit window and I go

373
00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:49.350
over into like wacky boxes
and tiles world. And I

374
00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:52.290
type in device manager, let
me do it right now.

375
00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:55.260
So I just typed in
device manager and I'm frustrated

376
00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:58.560
because it's not showing up.
Cause device manager and windows

377
00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:01.380
eight is not an app.
Right? I mean, it is

378
00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:03.960
an app. It's just like
it was before, except they

379
00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:08.190
separate apps, settings and files.
So when you hit windows,

380
00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:11.640
that brings up apps, windows
w that brings up settings

381
00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:14.610
and you hit windows F
that brings up files. And

382
00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:16.860
I kept having to remember,
and that was really frustrating

383
00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:19.770
to me. Then I hit
window X. And what happens

384
00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:24.300
when you hit windows X
in windows eight Brings up

385
00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:29.130
a nice little right click
menu, basically of all your

386
00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:34.020
useful shortcuts, power options event,
viewer, device manager, some great

387
00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:39.750
stuff. Like basically the, the
power users start menu. And

388
00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:42.840
ironically, it shows up in
the lower left corner where

389
00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:45.990
the start menu used to
show up. You can also

390
00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:48.420
get it by right clicking.
You know, if you hover

391
00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:51.120
down into the left corner
to see the start icon

392
00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:55.350
and you right. Click you'll
get the menu. Oh, okay.

393
00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:58.020
So right now, if I
hover, meaning I sh like

394
00:22:58.030 --> 00:23:00.900
I throw the mouse into
the corner, I get a

395
00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:05.430
little picture of the start
menu, right? Click program files,

396
00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:09.930
power options event, viewer device
manager, disk management, command prompt,

397
00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:13.410
and command prompt admin. And
as I remember, there's a

398
00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:15.420
way to a, not a
supported way, but there is

399
00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:18.000
a way to hack into
that menu that Rafael Rivera

400
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.870
figured out. Yeah. Third party
tool out that I saw

401
00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:24.300
that allows you to put
stuff there. Cause it's all,

402
00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:27.360
they're all just shortcuts on
your, on your disc. But

403
00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:30.710
windows seems to be particular
about which one is it?

404
00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:35.010
Those shortcuts that'll actually listened
to. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Window

405
00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:38.220
X seems to be something
that it's, it's not a

406
00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:41.280
start menu. It's a quick
launcher of some kind, but

407
00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:43.530
it's the one that I
find myself using the most.

408
00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:47.270
And then I've also just
gone and pinned all the

409
00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:51.410
different things to my desktop.
So I'm spending probably 85,

410
00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:55.460
90% of my time in
the desktop. I rarely see

411
00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:59.210
the boxes in whatever menu
do you spend your time

412
00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:02.380
over there at all? And
the windows eight menu On

413
00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:05.530
my desktop PC that doesn't
have touch. I really don't

414
00:24:05.530 --> 00:24:07.570
spend a whole lot of
time with that menu up.

415
00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:11.800
I it's pretty much all
desktop on my sleep when

416
00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:13.690
I'm at home. It depends
on how I'm using it,

417
00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:16.060
right. If I'm using it
for development, then that'd be

418
00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:17.950
sitting at the desktop. But
if I'm using it, cause

419
00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:19.750
I'm sitting on the couch
and I'm surfing the web,

420
00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:23.440
then I'll use the apps
on the start menu because

421
00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:28.570
they're more touch friendly speaking.
When I, when I launched

422
00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:31.450
the start menu, the first
time on my, on my

423
00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:36.190
30 inch or your previously
your 30 inch, I was

424
00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:39.850
immediately like, Oh man, you
know, everything's so big. I

425
00:24:39.850 --> 00:24:42.310
want to see more stuff.
I want more, I want

426
00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:45.220
to, I want to make
use of all these pixels.

427
00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:48.490
So I was goofing around
and I didn't realize this,

428
00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:50.920
but when I went to
the lower, the lower corner

429
00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:53.220
of the lower right corner,
that's where you get settings.

430
00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:56.110
So it's apps in the
lower left settings in the

431
00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:58.510
lower, right. So I click
on that and I click

432
00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:00.550
on settings. And I don't
know if you've seen this

433
00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:03.160
before or not. If you
go to settings and then

434
00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:06.250
you click on tiles, there's
a button or switch that

435
00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:08.560
says show more tiles, have
you, if you've made the

436
00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:12.490
change to this setting? Oh
no, I've never even seen

437
00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:15.010
this before. Dude. You're going
to love this. So lower

438
00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:20.800
right. Corner settings tiles, or
you just hit when or

439
00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:24.070
windows C for charms, go
to settings and watch what

440
00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:28.210
happens when you hit show
more tiles. That's pretty cool.

441
00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:31.930
It shifts everything up to
give you more space. Right?

442
00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:36.700
Exactly. So it basically basically
says use all available space

443
00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:40.120
vertically. And then suddenly I
can actually on my 30

444
00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:44.200
inch monitor without making the
tiles small, I can see

445
00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:48.880
effectively everything that I would
want to run. So it's

446
00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:54.820
kinda like almost like mission
control on a Mac. And

447
00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:56.860
then of course, you know
that you can right. Click

448
00:25:56.860 --> 00:26:04.150
on any application and then
say smaller or larger. So

449
00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:06.160
I took some of these
apps that I don't really

450
00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:09.040
care about. Like here I've
got messaging. Messaging is like

451
00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:12.400
the Facebook chat application. It
lets you chat with windows

452
00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:16.240
live and Facebook, but it's
taking up double-wide and that's

453
00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:17.920
frustrating. So I right click
on it and then I

454
00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:21.430
click smaller and then I
turn it into a half

455
00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:24.140
size tile and then I'll
drag it somewhere else. I

456
00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:26.830
don't have to look at
it all the time. You

457
00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:31.240
can also turn off. If,
if a tile is displaying

458
00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:33.280
information, you don't want it
to display. You can turn

459
00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:37.030
off live tiles as well,
but that same way. Oh,

460
00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:38.620
is that how I can
make it stop showing me

461
00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:44.010
your face? You know, I'm
your best Facebook friend. It's

462
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:46.320
True. Apparently Facebook has decided
and it's just like, Oh,

463
00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:50.130
there's Pat again. Yeah. It's
showing my, my, my people

464
00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:52.710
all the time. And every
once in a while, like

465
00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:55.380
why is this person showing
up? It's a, I don't

466
00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:57.090
know how it's making those
decisions, but it is kind

467
00:26:57.090 --> 00:26:58.860
of funny though, because I'll
see people I haven't seen

468
00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:00.820
in a while and I'll
be like, Oh, there's there's

469
00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:02.670
so, and so he's showing
up on my desktop there.

470
00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:06.320
And it's funny. I, the
way I arrange my start,

471
00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:09.590
my users dramatically different between
my desktop PC and my

472
00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:13.010
slate because there's apps, you
know, like the builtin apps

473
00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:15.200
that come with it that
I use on the slate

474
00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:16.940
quite a bit that I
hardly ever use on my

475
00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:19.850
desktop. People who are good
example of one, when I'm

476
00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:22.160
at work, people is not
really something I want to

477
00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:24.320
do while I'm at work.
So I just get rid

478
00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:26.510
of it entirely. But I
use it a lot at

479
00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:27.920
home because of course it
keeps me up to date

480
00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:30.410
on Facebook and Twitter and
all that stuff. So it's

481
00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:35.660
pretty cool that I'm finding
that, that on my desktop,

482
00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:38.720
which is the one with
the 30 inch monitor, I'm

483
00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:42.500
more likely to use the,
the news stuff. Like I'll

484
00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:44.690
kinda like lean back and
slouch and I'll read the

485
00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:46.460
news, I'll read like a
news app. And I also

486
00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:50.720
found another news app that's
called popular science. So you

487
00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:54.380
seen the popular science app.
It's almost like kind of

488
00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:56.570
like the verge or something,
but it's focused just on

489
00:27:56.570 --> 00:28:01.340
science stuff. And it's, I
like apps that will give

490
00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:04.370
me like a graphic that,
that is live. So I'm,

491
00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:08.330
I'm leaning towards lifestyle apps
more than non lifestyle apps.

492
00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:10.700
I'm not really interested in
an app that shows a

493
00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:12.920
pretty picture if it's not
changing that picture all the

494
00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:17.900
time. So I'm finding that
I'm rearranging my stuff mostly

495
00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:20.180
into news. So I've, I've
got like six or seven

496
00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:22.950
news apps. I've got like
an NBC news and, and

497
00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:26.660
you a USA today and
popular science and even the

498
00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:30.650
Wikipedia app will give you
like a featured article. So

499
00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:35.240
I'll make this like super
dashboard of news, which I

500
00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:37.550
didn't realize that I'm not,
I, it's funny. I get

501
00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:40.070
those talks from productivity and
I tell people exactly not

502
00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:43.070
to do that. And I've
gone and I've taken all

503
00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:46.850
this new operating system and
rather than making it totally

504
00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:49.100
personal, I've made it totally
impersonal and filled it with

505
00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:54.380
news and news information and
stocks and stuff and making

506
00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:57.350
all my decisions based on
what can this thing show

507
00:28:57.350 --> 00:29:02.750
me. I noticed also, do
you use the mail app?

508
00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:06.200
Cause there's like, there's, I've
got outlook 2013, but then

509
00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:08.960
there's the, the mail application,
which is a whole other

510
00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:13.280
thing. Hi, don't really use
the mail app. I use

511
00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:15.590
the calendar app a lot.
And in fact, one of

512
00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:18.800
the best things about windows
eight for me is I've

513
00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:21.920
hooked my calendar up to
all of my calendars, right?

514
00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:25.970
My personal calendar, Gmail, my
work calendar work. And then

515
00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:28.280
when the computer's locked and
I come back to it

516
00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:30.710
and I need to go
to a meeting, whereas before

517
00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:32.450
I need to have to
unlock it, to figure out

518
00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:35.240
where I'm going, or maybe
pull out my phone, I

519
00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:37.760
can just wake the screen
up. And it tells me

520
00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:39.800
what my next meeting is
right there on the lock

521
00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:42.340
screen. It tells me to
go, which is, I think

522
00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:44.410
is like one of those
features, you don't realize how

523
00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:46.210
awesome it is until you
use it all the time.

524
00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:48.460
Cause I mean, think about
what I would have to

525
00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:50.020
do before. It's like, you
have to take control of

526
00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:51.610
the lead and you have
to type in your password

527
00:29:51.610 --> 00:29:53.770
and then you have to
go find out outlook. You

528
00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:56.140
have to launch outlook. You
have to, is it in

529
00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:58.240
the right view, go into
the calendar view. They'll figure

530
00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:00.220
out what's next. And now
I just look at the

531
00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:05.490
screen and there it is
Do do huh. Okay. And

532
00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:06.960
it will merge, it will
merge them. Like I don't

533
00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:10.140
want to merge stuff and
accidentally ended up like having

534
00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:11.970
all my context merged. I
want to be able to

535
00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:15.300
turn stuff on and off.
Yeah. What's nice about the

536
00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:19.170
calendar is you, you basically
assign different colors. And so

537
00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:21.870
you can tell, like I
have all my work stuff

538
00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:24.240
is one color and all
my personal stuff is another.

539
00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:27.840
So you can see which
things on my calendar, you

540
00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:31.020
know, came from where, Okay,
I'm doing that right now.

541
00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:33.780
Yeah. I could see the
calendar being useful. Particularly if

542
00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:37.380
I updated like my kitchen
PC, you know, like the

543
00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:40.140
machine we use in the
kitchen for family calendars and

544
00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:43.380
stuff. But I don't know.
I don't think I could

545
00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:47.820
see myself using the mail
app Was a little bit

546
00:30:47.910 --> 00:30:52.590
under featured for me. It's
just, it's, it's like 80%

547
00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:54.630
of the way there, but
the 20% that it's missing

548
00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:56.430
for me. Cause I feel
like I'm a power user

549
00:30:56.550 --> 00:30:58.950
is enough to make it
may not want to use

550
00:30:58.950 --> 00:31:01.920
it. Yeah. Yeah. I agree.
I I've I've I find

551
00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:05.100
that it's maybe, maybe my
family could use it, but

552
00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:08.070
for, for, for work, I
don't, I don't see it

553
00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:12.570
happening. Although ironically, I end
up leaving it open, not

554
00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:16.290
open rather, but like on
the, on the, the tile

555
00:31:16.290 --> 00:31:20.850
menu, the windows eight menu,
because I like the live

556
00:31:20.850 --> 00:31:23.520
tile. Like I want to
see that I've got a

557
00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:25.440
male or I want to
see some subject of the

558
00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:27.810
next male, but I don't
want to click on the

559
00:31:27.810 --> 00:31:29.820
app. I'd like to like
click on it and go

560
00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:32.970
to outlook. You know what
I mean? Right, right. Yeah.

561
00:31:34.170 --> 00:31:37.800
Have you written any apps
yet? I have not written

562
00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:42.510
any apps for the story
yet. I, I honestly I

563
00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:44.280
keep, I keep wanting to
come up with something and

564
00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:46.380
I don't really have any
good ideas in the back

565
00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:49.890
of my head, which, you
know, I guess that's a

566
00:31:49.890 --> 00:31:53.910
stopping point or not, but
yeah, I'm going to take

567
00:31:53.910 --> 00:31:57.540
baby smash and poured it
over my, my, if for

568
00:31:57.540 --> 00:31:59.910
listeners who aren't familiar, baby
smashes an app, I use

569
00:31:59.910 --> 00:32:02.730
to teach myself XAML and
you can get it for

570
00:32:02.730 --> 00:32:06.210
free@babysmash.com. It's good for toddlers.
So I thought that'd be

571
00:32:06.210 --> 00:32:09.930
fun to port, baby smash
to a windows eight. And

572
00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:13.380
I thought I'd do it
twice, once in XAML and

573
00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:17.850
C-sharp and once in a
HTML five and JavaScript. Oh,

574
00:32:17.850 --> 00:32:19.950
that'd be fun. Yeah. If
you want to work on

575
00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:23.600
that with me, I'm kind
of figuring out something, but

576
00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:26.340
yeah. I mean, people are
writing apps so fast. It's

577
00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:27.660
like every time I come
up with an idea, like

578
00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:29.700
I wanted to do a
flight tracker I'm okay. That

579
00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:33.060
was done already. Flight trackers
finished. So it's like how,

580
00:32:33.210 --> 00:32:37.860
you know, I gotta have
that killer idea. Yeah. And

581
00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:40.400
I think a baby smash
work well, because you know,

582
00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:43.130
people will get a, get
a slate, like the Samsung

583
00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:45.950
or maybe the surface when
it comes out and you

584
00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:47.930
know, kind of like people
would use, you had a

585
00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:51.670
version for the iPad. Yeah,
buddy. I did an iPad

586
00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:55.000
version and I'm thinking also
it's time for toddler smash.

587
00:32:55.030 --> 00:32:57.130
My kids are old enough
now that I want to

588
00:32:57.130 --> 00:32:59.200
make more of a typewriter
game. So I think I

589
00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:02.290
might use the opportunity, not
just to learn a windows

590
00:33:02.290 --> 00:33:05.710
eight development, but also update
it to something, something a

591
00:33:05.710 --> 00:33:10.000
little more useful for my
kids. Cause they're older. Yeah.

592
00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:12.910
That seems, that seems like
a good idea. Yeah. Cool.

593
00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:15.910
Alright. Well, thanks for chatting
with me about windows eight.

594
00:33:15.910 --> 00:33:17.590
I know that you were
you're, you're kind of a

595
00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:19.510
Mac guy and that you
would give it to me

596
00:33:19.510 --> 00:33:23.260
straight. No, it's funny. I
have a, been a Mac

597
00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:25.090
guy for a long time,
but I currently don't have

598
00:33:25.090 --> 00:33:28.360
any Mac PCs. I just
sold my iMac about six

599
00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:33.640
months ago to build my
gaming desktop PC. She sold

600
00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:37.120
the Mac to buy a
Rahar gaming gaming rig. Cause

601
00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:38.920
you were like, you were
like the head of like

602
00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:41.440
the Mac user group or
whatever. Like when the Microsoft

603
00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:43.960
max at Microsoft mailing list,
you were so active on

604
00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:49.030
that. No, I'm still on
the list, but I it's

605
00:33:49.030 --> 00:33:50.890
just, it's just a weird
place for me right now.

606
00:33:50.890 --> 00:33:54.280
I just don't have any
Macs. I don't, I don't

607
00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:56.830
see it getting any in
the near future either because

608
00:33:56.830 --> 00:33:59.800
as nice as the, as
the retina MacBook pro is,

609
00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:03.820
you know, I'm, I'm sort
of anticipating that the surface

610
00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:06.310
pro is going to have
roughly the same DPI and

611
00:34:06.370 --> 00:34:10.900
touchscreen. So it's hard for
me to invest in, you

612
00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:13.450
know, a fairly expensive laptop,
but doesn't have the touch

613
00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:16.210
when you know, we're here
in windows eight, kind of

614
00:34:16.210 --> 00:34:19.180
an understandable thing. Why Apple
doesn't see it as important

615
00:34:19.180 --> 00:34:21.640
as we do. So, you
know, it's not like I

616
00:34:21.970 --> 00:34:26.620
fault them for not making
a touch screen laptop. Doesn't

617
00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:29.950
have all these features, but
you know, this is kind

618
00:34:29.950 --> 00:34:32.410
of where I, my bread
and butter is. And so,

619
00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:34.720
you know, five years ago
you could say a Mac

620
00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:37.330
book pro is the best
windows, this a laptop or

621
00:34:37.330 --> 00:34:39.610
the best windows seven laptop.
It's certainly not going to

622
00:34:39.610 --> 00:34:43.660
be true for windows eight.
Well, I've got, I've got,

623
00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:48.280
what is it? What's the
new lion mountain lion. I've

624
00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:51.370
got mountain lion on my
Mac book pro and I

625
00:34:51.370 --> 00:34:53.470
have windows eight in a,
in a, in a VM

626
00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:55.090
if I need it, but
I'm, I'm not ready to

627
00:34:55.090 --> 00:34:58.060
put windows eight on my
Mac. And I'm still, I

628
00:34:58.060 --> 00:34:59.680
think that the jury is
still out as far as

629
00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:03.610
like, who's gonna, who's gonna
win, but I I've, I've

630
00:35:04.450 --> 00:35:07.270
got a line on an
ultra book, which is like

631
00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:10.240
a P a MacBook air
PC and ultra book is

632
00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:12.550
going to be, I'm going
to be interested to see

633
00:35:12.570 --> 00:35:15.130
if we can make hardware
that is as good as

634
00:35:15.130 --> 00:35:18.280
the Mac hardware. That would
be pretty awesome. No, I

635
00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:21.250
have a, you know, I
haven't obviously seen the surface

636
00:35:21.250 --> 00:35:23.350
cause I learned about it
at the same time everybody

637
00:35:23.350 --> 00:35:27.970
else. And it's a pretty
secret thing, but I have

638
00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:31.720
faith that the surface is
going to be a pretty

639
00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:35.500
nice PC. Yeah. Yeah. Well,
in, in closing, I'll tell

640
00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:37.710
you a funny story where
I took my to best

641
00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:41.610
buy to shore some of
the new thin laptops, cause

642
00:35:41.610 --> 00:35:44.700
she's got an old Dell
that's pretty fat and she's

643
00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:46.380
like, well, how do I
know if it's a good

644
00:35:46.410 --> 00:35:47.880
PC or not? And I
was like, well, how can

645
00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:50.130
I explain this in a
really simple way that that

646
00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:54.120
will just, just make sense?
And I said, flip the

647
00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:58.320
laptop over. And the fewer
seams you see underneath, it's

648
00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:00.840
the, probably the better made
it is. So we just

649
00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:04.590
basically spent an afternoon flipping.
It's like, you know, that

650
00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:06.360
way that you tell the
sex of a turtle is

651
00:36:06.370 --> 00:36:07.890
flip it over and like,
look at the way that

652
00:36:07.890 --> 00:36:10.770
the, the, the, the tr
underneath the turtle shell is,

653
00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:12.660
it's the same thing with
F with PCs. You know,

654
00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:15.510
the smoother that the, the
bottom of the PC is

655
00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:18.000
the better it is now.
She found that to be

656
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.410
a very, she found that
to be a very good,

657
00:36:20.730 --> 00:36:23.310
good way to tell. Cool.
Thanks for talking to me,

658
00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:27.060
Brad. Yeah, it was fun.
This has been another episode

659
00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:29.340
of Hansel minutes, and we'll
see you again next week.
