In this episode, Scott talks

9
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:58.680
with Jeff Atwood about his
new startup discourse. Hi, this

10
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.860
is Scott Enhancement. This is
another episode of Hansel minutes.

11
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.710
I'm talking with Jeff Atwood.
We were having an interesting

12
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.560
conversation and I realized that
it's better. When interesting conversations

13
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.220
have the microphone on you
don't customize your editor colors

14
00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.460
anymore. No, I there's. A
lot of things that have

15
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.290
kind of fallen away that
I used to care about

16
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.540
when I was younger and
younger as documented on my

17
00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.630
blogs. This was like, I
started my blog in 2004.

18
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.880
That's not quite 10 years.
So I'm talking about the

19
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.990
eight or seven year old
me. It's not like ancient

20
00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.870
history, right? Like I totally
just do not care about

21
00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.020
customizing editor colors. I get,
I get an email probably

22
00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.750
once or twice a week,
you know? And it's usually

23
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.090
very well, well, meaning broken
English, please, please Hanselman. Send

24
00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.050
me your visual studio settings
file. I want my IDE

25
00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.020
to be like yours. And
the answer is, well, it's

26
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.040
already like mine because I
leave the defaults. Send me

27
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.610
your customized hotkeys. Well, I
use the default Hockeys yeah,

28
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.820
like I make the font
bigger because I'm old, you

29
00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.750
know, that's basically make the
font 14 point and move

30
00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.310
on. I remember used to
use to be on a

31
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.850
quest for the perfect programming
font. I don't care. I'm

32
00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.300
just console us. Yeah. Well,
something did change there with

33
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.880
fonts though, as monitors got
high resolution, we're moving into

34
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.870
the retina era slowly on
desktop or getting there. So

35
00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.810
it's, I think fun becomes
a little easier because you

36
00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.090
have much more resolution, so
it can just look more

37
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.500
awesome. Sort of by default,
basically. Right? Like before what

38
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.690
I originally talked about fonts,
I wasn't even using clear

39
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.030
type meaning I wasn't using
any aliasing. It was like,

40
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.760
literally remember that. I remember
that pixel fonts, like on

41
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.650
an arcade game from the
eighties, that's what we were

42
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.710
doing. And that's what we
were talking about. So like

43
00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.760
the whole tone of the
discussion, it just changed because

44
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.670
of the technology change. That's
another reason. But also, because

45
00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.280
like you said, it's just
defaults who has time for

46
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.650
this? I mean, as I
mentioned, I have the twin

47
00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.920
girls who are almost two
now and the discourse project.

48
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.660
So there's, it's just sort
of a limited number of

49
00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.310
things I can worry about
in my life. Now at

50
00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.180
this age, like time, time
falls away from you. As

51
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.280
you get older, you have
so much time, you don't

52
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.740
realize it. It's just the
problem when you're young to

53
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.100
do whatever. And as you
get older, your time falls

54
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.600
away. Because first of all,
you run out of it.

55
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.150
You actually die at the
end of this, right? You

56
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.090
start realizing that as you
get older and thinking about

57
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.040
it. And then second, because
you have a lot more

58
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.070
commitments to your time, but
the kids is the big

59
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.870
one. Like, and I love
the time I spent with

60
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.430
my kids. Don't get me
wrong. There they're so much

61
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.640
fun, but it is a
lot of time and it's

62
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.000
important time, right? Like it's,
you need to slice out

63
00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.790
part of your life for
these new people. I mean,

64
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.950
they need you, they literally,
they need you. They need

65
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.040
you to be what they
want to be. How has

66
00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.480
one of your kids told
you to put your phone

67
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.440
down yet? I try to
be careful with that when

68
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.270
I'm with my kids. Like
I try not to be

69
00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.340
the guy who's always on
his phone, like, cause me

70
00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.510
and my wife do that
to each other now and

71
00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.070
I feel bad and I
read about it on Twitter.

72
00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.170
Like we're just on our
little phone worlds, you know?

73
00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.690
It's like, Oh, hello, you're
still here. And you're sort

74
00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.190
of there, but not there,
there was a New York times

75
00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.300
article about this called alone
together, you know? Yeah. It

76
00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.150
was really kind of disturbing,
but I try really try

77
00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.310
not to do with that
as one of them said

78
00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.980
that yet. No, because I've
been really careful. They're not

79
00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.680
quite old enough to be.
I mean, Henry is almost

80
00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.260
five. He's getting to be
five and he's starting to

81
00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.940
be more insightful with some
of the things he'll say

82
00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.780
to us. And he's, you
know, beginning to have the

83
00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.870
level of cognitive ability to
be able to, you know,

84
00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.500
judge us basically, if you're
doing it correctly, like I

85
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.480
was having a discussion with
Henry as like, Oh, we

86
00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.520
have too many Legos. We
can't even play with Lego's.

87
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.170
We have, and he said,
dad, you bought me all

88
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.000
those Legos. Why did you
do that? And I said,

89
00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.570
I, I don't know. You
know, I did you're right.

90
00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.370
I did do that. I
got us too many Legos.

91
00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.170
Now I have so many
Legos that it's kind of

92
00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:44.700
hard to play with them.
It's kind of becomes a

93
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.400
problem. It was not, you
know, it was not a

94
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.460
wise life choice Because you
told yourself when you were

95
00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.050
going to have kids, like,
okay, they're never going to

96
00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.990
watch TV. They're going to
eat organic foods. They won't

97
00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.200
be spoiled. They'll get one
toy a month, you know?

98
00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.230
And they'll care about that
toy. No, they won't, you

99
00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:05.010
know, it's just chaos. Like
every, every month it's just

100
00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.020
a Trek to, and from
Goodwill. I don't know if

101
00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.930
you're one of the thrift
store people, but Goodwill. It's

102
00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.560
like, if you could go
to toys R us and

103
00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.300
then rent a toy and
bring it back, that would

104
00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.070
be Goodwill for us. We
go to Goodwill, we buy

105
00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:18.750
a crappy toy and then
we bring it back. We

106
00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.810
donate it back into the,
into the fold. Oh, that's

107
00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.180
an interesting stress. It is.
They get more toys that

108
00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.400
way. And then it's like
a thread pool release. You

109
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.400
just use the thread, it's
a cheap thread. And then

110
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.100
you release it back into
the pool. That's great. We

111
00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.290
actually moved toys into the
garage sometimes like cycle them

112
00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:36.720
through, but that's much more
manual than what you're describing.

113
00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.150
And also you have to
buy and keep all the

114
00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.640
toys. That's interesting catching, catching
release. I'm telling you, it's

115
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.520
a really great system. You,
you, every Saturday, this is

116
00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.230
totally true. We just put
a bunch of toys in

117
00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:47.880
the back of the car
and we go off to

118
00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.810
Goodwill and we spend like,
you know, $8, which is

119
00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.480
like a car worth of
toys at Goodwill. And we

120
00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:58.640
find amazing stuff. I have
a, a 16 inch tall,

121
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.090
full bumblebee transformer that I've
found at Goodwill. But to

122
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:03.680
see the trick is you
have to go to Goodwill

123
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:08.390
regularly to get the deals.
They're still spoiled. I mean,

124
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:11.150
we're buying cheap toys, but
they're still spoiled. Yeah. And

125
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:12.560
they, and I love that.
They, you said that they

126
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.530
judge you because my six
year old is like, daddy,

127
00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.490
Oh, you're on the phone
again. Who are you talking

128
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.200
to us? He like, Oh,
just pull my heart out

129
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.730
and step on it. And
just tell me I'm a

130
00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:24.350
bad parent. Just go ahead
and tell me that I'm

131
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:28.450
a bad parent. Yeah. The
talking to your kids part.

132
00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:31.980
It's really, really fun. Yeah.
They're hilarious. You know, you

133
00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:33.790
have a Twitter account for
your son. Do you still

134
00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:38.260
do that Sporadically? Keep it
up to date. But yeah,

135
00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:40.990
I, I enjoy documenting that
stuff as it comes up.

136
00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:43.810
Cause you forget a lot.
I think it's conditioned into

137
00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:45.790
us genetically to forget a
lot of stuff that happens

138
00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:49.690
as a parent. Otherwise nobody
would have more children, but

139
00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.730
some of the stuff you
don't want to forget, like

140
00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:54.910
when we had the, the
lady babies, the twins, we

141
00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:56.980
were remembering all the stuff
that happened with Henry because

142
00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:58.780
we went, Oh yeah, that's
right. That stuff happened with

143
00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:02.170
Henry and you just forget
everything. So it's nice to

144
00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:05.080
have I got the overheard
at home is the, where

145
00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.660
I put my kids' stuff.
Oh, nice. My eight year

146
00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:10.150
old said, can I go
back in time and open

147
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:13.570
presents early? So I'm like,
how am I going to

148
00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:16.120
answer that? So I said,
well, I said, no, yesterday

149
00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:20.440
when you arrived from the
future And he was getting

150
00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.060
something to think about that.
And he's just like, that

151
00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:24.970
happened already. I mean, you
totally mess with their heads

152
00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:28.660
like that. Yeah. And the
five-year-old was typing a story

153
00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:31.180
in notepad and he's like,
daddy, I want to go

154
00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:33.790
back and destroy it. And
I'm like, I'm like, what

155
00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:35.950
are you talking about? It's
like that letter. And I

156
00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:38.530
said, well, push backspace. And
he pushes backspace and he

157
00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:41.950
goes destroyed. And like with
glee and I'm like, Oh,

158
00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:45.400
I didn't push backspace with
that kind of glee. You

159
00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.560
know what I mean? And
like, so my argument of

160
00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.690
like, why it's okay, that
I'm occasionally on Twitter is

161
00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:53.440
that I'm documenting these things
for some future book deal.

162
00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.170
Well, that's the reason, I
mean, if you go back

163
00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.120
more selfishly to why I
started my blog, it's really,

164
00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.400
it's about documenting my seven
year old self. Like we

165
00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.770
originally talked about like, what
was I like seven years

166
00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:04.540
ago? What was it like
10 years ago? I don't

167
00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:08.470
remember. And like sometimes like
recently on Twitter, for example,

168
00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:11.680
I had this experience where
I bought a chair online,

169
00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:13.900
like a new fancy chair.
I was like the one

170
00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:16.090
nice, like my gift to
myself this year, I guess.

171
00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:18.070
So I bought myself a
suit, a really fancy chair,

172
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:21.100
even fancier the one and
a half. And it was

173
00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:23.590
the Herman Miller embody. If
anyone's curious, is there a

174
00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:25.780
better than the airline it's
supposed to be? I'm going

175
00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:27.580
to kind of try it
out. It's I dunno. It's

176
00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:29.950
just chairs. You know, I
still do believe in chairs.

177
00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:31.960
That's one thing that hasn't
changed on like fonts and

178
00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:36.190
editor. That's old. That's old,
man. I mean, I blogged

179
00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:40.600
about that when I said
a bed back funds, like

180
00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.940
all you have available to
you is like your brain,

181
00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:46.150
your butt, your back, you
know, that's like, you have

182
00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:48.100
to maintain those things. So
you need to be sleeping

183
00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:50.460
well and sitting well, well
I's as well. Oh yeah.

184
00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:52.720
That's true. Actually. I haven't
done anything with my eyes.

185
00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:55.740
Have you? Well, monitors, I
mean, just don't your monitors,

186
00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:59.660
like get really nice monitors
that actually work. Don't don't

187
00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:01.940
get something that's going to
make you blind. Okay. So

188
00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:04.370
what you got this chair,
I ordered this chair and

189
00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:06.350
then I realized like 30
days later, I had not

190
00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:07.890
heard anything about this year.
It's like, well, I paid

191
00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:09.740
him, you know, these are
expensive chairs. And it's like

192
00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:11.120
over a thousand dollars, this
chair. And it's like, I

193
00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.010
don't know what even happened
to this order. And I

194
00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:14.540
was going through my email.
It's like, well, this is

195
00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:16.220
weird. And then I had
to go to my PayPal

196
00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:19.100
account. Cause I had actually
paid with PayPal, PayPal and

197
00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:21.410
document like, okay, I actually
did do this. And I

198
00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:23.330
called them. I physically called
them. You know how painful

199
00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:25.520
it is as a techie
to physically call someone at

200
00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:27.530
that point, you're desperate. You're
ready to kill someone. Right?

201
00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:30.710
Like if I have to
dial a frigging phone, I'm

202
00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:33.350
kind of pissed already. Right.
So I dialed the phone

203
00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:34.730
and I was like, well,
what happened to this order?

204
00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:35.900
I was like, I have
this PayPal. I know I

205
00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:37.910
paid you guys. Where is
my chair? Like, I didn't

206
00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:40.940
even know if the order
went through. And the guy

207
00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:42.620
says to me, he's like,
and he was very nice.

208
00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:45.080
It was a nice guy.
He totally handled it correctly.

209
00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.850
I had no, you know,
I wasn't angry or anything

210
00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:49.250
at that point. And he
said, well, our email often

211
00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:50.930
goes to spam and he's
like, let me send you

212
00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:53.360
an email right now just
telling you what's going on.

213
00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:55.580
They were the long story
short is they're still building

214
00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:57.950
the chair. It's custom colors
and all this stuff and

215
00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:59.720
has to come from the
factory and it wasn't ready,

216
00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:01.670
but I didn't know any
of that. And so he

217
00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:03.890
sends this email and sure
enough, I check in my

218
00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:06.680
Gmail account and it's under
spam, which is really, really

219
00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:08.810
rare for me. Like Gmail
is pretty good with the

220
00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:11.570
spam. And I was like,
wow, that's really weird. And

221
00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:14.330
I checked the headers and
I told this guy, I

222
00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:16.220
was like, how do you
have this conversation? I was

223
00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:17.840
like, well, look, you know,
I don't want to be

224
00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.880
weird about this, but I
have Wikipedia entry. I've actually

225
00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:21.650
built things on the internet.
And I think you guys

226
00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:23.870
are really doing something wrong
with your email. If all

227
00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:27.770
your email is going to
spam, something is wrong and

228
00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:29.540
you guys should fix it.
And you know, and it's

229
00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:31.670
like, how do you explain
this to this guy? And

230
00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:33.330
so then I looked at
my blog entry on that

231
00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:35.090
because I wrote a whole
blog entry about how weird

232
00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:37.220
it is sending mail. The
first step in code is

233
00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:40.250
like, Oh, send mail done.
But the actual bug part

234
00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:42.560
of sending the mail is
all the bullshit you have

235
00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:45.020
to do to get your
mail, to be deliverable, which

236
00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:47.570
has almost nothing to do
with the code and everything

237
00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:50.050
to do with like your
server configuration, the reverse pizza,

238
00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:53.720
our record shaving. Yeah, it
is. And I had this,

239
00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:56.360
this post I wrote, which
documented all this stuff that

240
00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.220
at the time I really
wanted to remember. And I

241
00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:00.200
did remember it and I
could give it to this

242
00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:02.390
guy as weird as that
sounds. It's like, here's some

243
00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:04.880
customer I'm going to fix
all your problems. But as

244
00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:07.970
a customer, I selfishly want
to know. I mean, this

245
00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:10.010
is a business where I,
I, a customer had no

246
00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:11.420
idea where my order was.
I was like, this is

247
00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:14.180
crazy. You know, you guys
need to fix this. And

248
00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:15.950
here's a blog entry I
wrote so that I could

249
00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:18.350
remember this and share it
with you. Right, right. This

250
00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:20.390
is why we do this
stuff. It's the same principle

251
00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:23.060
of a Twitter account for
our kids. And all that

252
00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:25.200
stuff is you're trying to
create this breadcrumb trail of

253
00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:29.150
useful information that you can
follow and then other people

254
00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:32.630
can follow it. And that's
great. And that's entirely the

255
00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:34.430
point of it. It's not
nearly as frivolous as it.

256
00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:37.790
Sometimes It's such an obvious
thing though. Like everyone, I

257
00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:39.800
assume you get the same
thing with like, how do

258
00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.750
you stick with it and
how are you working on,

259
00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:43.370
you know, how do you
keep logging? And it's like,

260
00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:45.110
well, I don't want to
lose this. So I gotta

261
00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:48.530
put it somewhere. And I
know that email is not

262
00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:50.180
where you put things. Like
if you want to, if

263
00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:53.560
you want to remember anything,
email is the place to

264
00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:57.430
put it, right? Yeah. I,
I will, I will not

265
00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:00.550
answer emails and instead write
a blog post and send

266
00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:03.390
someone a link to the
blog post. And it's weird

267
00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:05.130
too, as much as, you
know, as a programmer, I

268
00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:08.550
grew up sort of in
the era when computers weren't

269
00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:11.310
really connected to the internet
at all, using a computer

270
00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:14.340
was a very solitary activity.
And the reason I got

271
00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:16.650
into it was that I
was an introvert and you

272
00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:20.040
know, people are scary. People,
aren't predictable. People are, I

273
00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:22.590
don't even understand how girls
work for God's sake. So

274
00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:24.840
I would spend all my
time on this computer. It

275
00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:26.130
didn't go to my prom.
Didn't do any of that

276
00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:27.900
stuff. I mean, I had
friends, but I was very

277
00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:31.530
much an introvert. And now
every project I've worked on

278
00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:36.180
every single one since like
2008 has been about talking

279
00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:38.730
to other people on the
internet, like connecting people together

280
00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:40.680
so that they can talk
to each other. These are

281
00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:43.500
what my projects do. That's
what stack overflow does. That's

282
00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:46.140
what stack exchange does. It's
you know, the programmer in

283
00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:50.340
Brazil answering question from a
programmer in New Jersey and discourse,

284
00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:52.050
you know, my new project
is the same thing. It's

285
00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:54.360
like letting these two people
talk to each other about

286
00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:58.500
basically bullshit, right? Like stack
overflow is very strict about

287
00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:00.540
that. No, we have to
talk about programming. We can't

288
00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:03.300
argue about which Java keyword
is. The coolest, you must

289
00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:05.700
answer the question. Let's actually
get some work done here.

290
00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:08.940
And discourse is more like,
Hey, we don't have to

291
00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:11.820
actually get any work done.
Let's talk about the coolest

292
00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:15.690
movie we've seen recently, but
it's about connecting people together

293
00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:18.870
and letting them talk. But
in a disconnected way, they're

294
00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:21.600
not actually sitting with each
other, But it's, it's, it's,

295
00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:24.450
it feels connected though. It
feels very connected, particularly on

296
00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:27.210
discourse. Cause you're talking about
more social, more personal things

297
00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:30.750
usually, right? Like, cause a
discourse forum could be about

298
00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.810
anything, including like some specialized
disease that your children have

299
00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:35.970
where you really have this
community that comes together and

300
00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:38.430
needs to help and support
each other. Right. In a

301
00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:41.250
very empathetic way where empathy
is the order of the

302
00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:43.980
day. It's not so much
solve my problem or get

303
00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:46.470
out of my face like
we do at stack exchange.

304
00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:48.330
But Hey, let me just
talk to you about how

305
00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:50.730
hard my day is with
my children. They have this

306
00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:52.490
disease, which is like, I
mean, that is so horrible.

307
00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:55.260
Like I can't even imagine,
you know, I think, you

308
00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.030
know, you and I are,
I think both very lucky

309
00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:59.220
to have very healthy children.
We don't have any real,

310
00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:01.590
you know, all we have
is first world problems. That

311
00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:04.260
don't matter as much when
it comes to our kids.

312
00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:07.500
That's all I'm talking about.
But imagine if you did

313
00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:10.830
imagine what that would feel
like, and that's what discourse

314
00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:12.780
is about. It's like bringing
those people, they can't physically

315
00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:15.120
be together, right? They just
can't. So that's the beauty

316
00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:16.710
of the internet. It's bringing
all these people together and

317
00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:19.590
this disconnect wave and it
feels so real. And in

318
00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:21.270
fact, I was about to
post this on Twitter, but

319
00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:24.240
I was kind of afraid
to that. My extended internet

320
00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:27.900
family feels more real to
me than my actual extended

321
00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:30.000
family, not my, my, you
know, my wife and my

322
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.940
children. Not that, but just
outside of that circle, my

323
00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:35.910
internet family feels so much
more real to me than

324
00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:37.770
my actual family. And I
was like, well, that's kind

325
00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:39.480
of a weird thing to
say to the point that

326
00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.310
I was a little uncomfortable
actually typing that in Twitter.

327
00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:42.630
I was like, well, people
are gonna think I'm weird,

328
00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:45.540
which sometimes it depends what
I'm saying. I don't mind.

329
00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:48.480
Cause you know, everybody's a
little weird, but I do,

330
00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:50.550
I really do feel that
way. And that's why I

331
00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:53.150
like, that's why I like
second changes. You build these

332
00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:56.210
connections. Like I had a
few people who are very,

333
00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:58.880
very good technically like sort
of understood. We were doing

334
00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:01.760
a stack exchange, follow me
to discourse. I don't mean

335
00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:05.060
like Sam saffron. Who's great.
He's who is a coworker

336
00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:07.430
on the project, but just
people who were sort of

337
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:09.830
in the universe of things
happening in second exchange and

338
00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:13.610
got shit done, followed me
to discourse. And I think

339
00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:15.290
that's amazing. And I love
these people. Like I think

340
00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:17.390
they're so good at what
they do. And it's just,

341
00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:20.270
I just love these relationships
I have with them. You

342
00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:22.040
know, they're, they're very at
arms length, they're over the

343
00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:23.660
internet. I don't know these
people like one guy's in

344
00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:25.850
Japan. He's actually Japanese as
far as I can tell.

345
00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:29.300
Nobody's so good. And I
love the interactions I have

346
00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:31.970
with him. And, and that
goes for a lot of

347
00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:35.090
the, the people that I
meet online and, and have

348
00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:40.430
these disconnected alone together moments
with those work for me,

349
00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:43.780
Similar in the sense that
she has these online relationships,

350
00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:46.180
because my wife and I
get into kind of lowercase

351
00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:50.290
a arguments about whether or
not I'm maintaining effective relationships.

352
00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:53.800
So like for example, I'll
talk to my cousin, I

353
00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:56.140
see him once a year
at Christmas. Right. But I

354
00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:59.290
feel quote unquote, close to
him cause I'm liking stuff

355
00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:02.260
on Facebook or tapping on
Instagram. Or I talked to,

356
00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:03.340
I feel like I talked
to the guy a couple

357
00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:05.950
of times a week and
I, and my wife will

358
00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:07.480
be like, yeah, we haven't
seen them in a while.

359
00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:09.280
We should go over there.
And I'm like, I talk

360
00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:11.650
to him all the time
and she's like, well, not

361
00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:16.030
really. You're not really talking
to them. Well, if you

362
00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:19.510
have the benefit of being
physically around, I think you

363
00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:22.450
should exploit that. I mean,
if you work at a

364
00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:24.370
place, you should sit down
with your coworkers and have

365
00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:26.440
lunch. I mean, you know,
my, my ex partner, Joel

366
00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:28.060
Spolsky was a huge fan
of that. He has a,

367
00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:30.570
an entry about, you know,
eating lunch together and the

368
00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:32.710
importance he placed on that.
And I do believe you

369
00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:36.760
should explain that when you
have that, but physical location

370
00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:40.390
is kind of a tough
requirement, right? Like say, you

371
00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:43.270
know, this gets into hiring.
And it's interesting because at

372
00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:46.780
fog Creek where Joel was,
and of course it's stack

373
00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:49.810
exchange, they they've actually opened
up remote hiring, which Joel

374
00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:52.360
was very, very, very opposed
to. But one thing I

375
00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:55.450
always pointed out was if
you have this idea that

376
00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:57.520
you're only hiring the best
of the best, but you're

377
00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:59.440
saying I'm hiring the best
of the best that are

378
00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:02.350
willing to move to New York
city. Are you really telling

379
00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:05.050
the truth, right? Are you
really hiring the best of

380
00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:06.760
the best or you're hiring
the best people that you

381
00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:09.790
know, can actually somehow make
their way to New York city?

382
00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:13.870
So it becomes disingenuous at
some level to say that.

383
00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:16.600
And a lot of the
work we are fortunate enough

384
00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:18.520
to be able to in
a, in a job where

385
00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:20.680
unlike doctors were, I don't
think you'd be a doctor.

386
00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:23.440
You need to touch someone
you can't, that's difficult to

387
00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:25.750
do remotely. It's, it's easy
to do our job remotely.

388
00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:29.740
Right? So I think having
both of those relationships available,

389
00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:32.320
in other words, the, the,
the distance relationship, the, the

390
00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:36.100
together alone relationship and the
physical relationship, I think are,

391
00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:39.280
you should exploit both of
those. You should exploit and

392
00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:43.030
take advantage of what you
have. Sure. But you don't

393
00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:45.940
think that one is invalid
because it is mostly online.

394
00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:48.460
Do No, not at all.
I think they're both. They're

395
00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:51.780
extremely, I think I'm like
my wife and I have

396
00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:54.800
interactions on Twitter that I
like, Isn't that weird though?

397
00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:57.080
Don't you ever have situations
where you, you know, how

398
00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:59.540
on Twitter, if someone replies
to someone that you also

399
00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:03.170
follow, you see it. So
I'll see famous people having

400
00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:05.570
conversations. And I'm like, I'm
not really supposed to be

401
00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:08.990
here, like wives and husbands
who are famous, like literally

402
00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:11.600
like actors and stuff, making
plans to meet for dinner.

403
00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:13.130
And I'm like, wow, you
guys know, we can see.

404
00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:17.660
Yeah. Surely I can't be
the only person that thinks

405
00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:20.960
about that. Right? Yeah. It's,
it's interesting. Cause we are

406
00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:23.870
moving into an era where
I think the together alone

407
00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:26.810
stuff is happening a lot
more just because the internet

408
00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:28.730
is happening in the internet
is so prevalent now. And

409
00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:31.040
so pervasive. I mean, you're
driving in your car and

410
00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:32.600
you can use the internet.
And that's still amazing to

411
00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:34.130
me. I can drive in
my car and use my

412
00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:36.680
little Android tablet and browse
the web. I was like,

413
00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:38.450
Holy crap. I was dreaming
about this. And she thought,

414
00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:41.030
well, I'm not driving. No,
no, no. As a passenger,

415
00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:45.680
of course, as driving as
a passenger, we have a

416
00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:48.620
lot of human beings in
our family. Now, a van,

417
00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:51.800
that sort of thing. So
one thing I was reminded

418
00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:54.800
of is you actually had
a forum on your blog

419
00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:57.650
for a while. Yeah. I
used ASP forums. It was

420
00:18:57.650 --> 00:19:00.350
there for about two years,
two years. It was, it

421
00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:01.910
was actually not just cause
I was, I wasn't just

422
00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:05.330
goofing around. People wanted it.
They wanted to a, somehow

423
00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:07.910
a handsome and branded place
to ask questions that was

424
00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:12.290
not spammy. Right. And one
thing we're looking at with

425
00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:16.520
the discourse project is the
reality of forums. A blog

426
00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:18.350
can be great. If just
one person is writing it,

427
00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:20.090
the one person that's talented
enough, the blog is going

428
00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:22.250
to be awesome and people
will find it. And it'll

429
00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:24.260
totally work. It may take
some time, but it'll work.

430
00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:27.980
Whereas a forum, you need
a quorum. You need like

431
00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:30.890
a number of people to
show up every day, go

432
00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:33.140
to this forum and participate
for it to even remotely

433
00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:35.300
work. And the type of
people that can pull that

434
00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:38.810
audience are for better or
worse famous people, you know,

435
00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:41.900
to some degree of, for
some value of, of F

436
00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:45.440
of famous. And that is
a scenario that, that does

437
00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:48.680
work. And one thing we're
getting into with, with discourse

438
00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:51.710
is we have a WordPress
plugin. So you have a

439
00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:54.560
famous WordPress blog. You can
then say, Hey, I want

440
00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:58.580
comments on my blog entries.
Hopefully you do opinions vary

441
00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:01.070
on this. I'm still a
fan, but I also want

442
00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:02.660
a place where those people
can go and talk to

443
00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:05.090
each other, like among themselves.
Right? They can talk about

444
00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:08.390
things that aren't necessarily, Oh,
you know, Jeff or Scott

445
00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:10.400
posted a blog entry. We
must talk about that. Right?

446
00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:12.170
They can talk about stuff
they want to talk about

447
00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:16.370
to. So that is a
model that the discourse discourse

448
00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:18.620
is very much designed around.
That's what the WordPress plugin

449
00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:21.260
does. It gives you blog
comments creates a topic for

450
00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:24.200
each blog entry and then
automatically, you know, hoists stuff

451
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:26.600
over the wall from the
clubhouse where the people are

452
00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:30.260
hanging out to the editorial
blog, where, you know, only

453
00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:33.530
you control what gets posted
there. And there's a lot

454
00:20:33.530 --> 00:20:35.720
of this static blog generation
stuff. Have you seen this

455
00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:38.870
like Octo press and Yeah,
people are saying that that's

456
00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:40.820
the way to do it
now. Like you get discussed

457
00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:44.000
or, or live fire or
any of the new kind

458
00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:46.280
of things like the blog,
the point it was that

459
00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:49.510
the blog engine, this was
too complicated. The idea that

460
00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:51.340
I would need to go
to the database every time

461
00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:53.710
I wanted to generate a
page, it's just silly. So

462
00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:55.450
then we would, you know,
like DAS blog, which is

463
00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:59.950
what I still run succeeds
because it caches everything. Basically

464
00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:02.200
there is no database call
cause there is no database.

465
00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:05.470
The next obvious step is
to just compile the blog

466
00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:09.820
and make it static and
then hide the comments and

467
00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:12.990
a service. And that's interesting
because I, I started with

468
00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:18.150
a type head, which was
famously a generated engine. Yeah.

469
00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:20.760
I forgot about that. Yeah.
Your whole blog was HTML.

470
00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:25.080
Yeah. And it wasn't, it
was generated. So it was

471
00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:26.310
cool at the beginning. But
then when you got like

472
00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:28.560
a thousand, 2000 blog entries,
it started to be a

473
00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:31.710
lot less cool because, and
I guess if you could

474
00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:34.530
make the generation super fast,
but it just got slower

475
00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:36.930
to take like minutes to
generate the blog. Every time

476
00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:40.080
you change something. And this
became really honorous. So it's

477
00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:42.870
interesting that that needle has
moved, but we noticed that

478
00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:47.400
too. And in fact, Robin
ward, one of my, the

479
00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:50.340
cofounders of the discourse project
has a blog that's generated

480
00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:54.000
that way. And some other
people have asked us like,

481
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.420
well, how can we use
discourse on a generated blog

482
00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:00.540
like that? And I said,
well, you know that that's

483
00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:02.820
an interesting scenario. We should
probably support that. So Robin

484
00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:05.040
can do it. You know,
I believe, let me get

485
00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:08.610
back and talk about philosophy
of, of software engineering. We

486
00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:11.100
found consistently this is true
on stack overflow and stack

487
00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:13.650
exchange as well. If you
build a feature that you

488
00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:18.390
don't use ever as a
team, that feature will stop

489
00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:20.610
working. It's only a matter
of time until that feature

490
00:22:20.610 --> 00:22:25.770
stops working because nobody, nobody
on your team is using

491
00:22:25.770 --> 00:22:28.710
that feature. So it just
doesn't, nobody cares. Nobody loves

492
00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:32.010
that feature. It doesn't matter.
And it just breaks. And

493
00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:34.620
we see this consistently. So
we have a philosophy that

494
00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:35.970
if we want something to
be in core, we believe

495
00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:39.570
it's really important. Then we
need to be doing it

496
00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:43.410
ourselves. And so with that
in mind, I told Robin,

497
00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:46.110
I was like, well, look,
let's just make discourse work

498
00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:52.170
with a static generation status,
statically generated blogs kind of

499
00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:54.030
in the way that discuss
does. But the difference with

500
00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:56.730
discourse is that you have
to actually go to the

501
00:22:56.730 --> 00:22:59.640
forum to respond because we
want to have there be

502
00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:03.960
a fairly strong wall between
the editorial content that someone

503
00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:05.520
is producing or a team
is producing. A team of

504
00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:09.480
editors is producing and the
community side, these are two

505
00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:11.370
buildings that are right next
door to each other. There's

506
00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:13.140
a door connecting them. Right.
But you have to go

507
00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:14.670
through that door and say,
now I'm in the community

508
00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:17.160
side. Now I do community
stuff, right? This is a

509
00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:19.560
place for us. This is
where the bouncy houses are

510
00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:22.860
and we jumped around. Right.
But then on the other

511
00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:25.620
side, they're very serious. It's
all editorial, no bouncy houses.

512
00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:29.070
Look, we're only publishing serious,
serious things here. And they

513
00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:32.190
control it. And with our
partners, we've consistently seen this

514
00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:34.980
model where you want to
place. It's kind of like

515
00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:37.590
a mullet, you know, it's
like, it's like all business

516
00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:39.300
in the front and then
kind of like a party

517
00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:42.600
in the back kind of
deal. Yeah. So that's what

518
00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:45.620
we want to do. And
you can see this evil

519
00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:50.030
trout.com that's Robin's internet handle.
You can sort of see

520
00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:53.030
this in action. We're, we're
building this and we want

521
00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:54.980
to, we want people to
have this option because I,

522
00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:58.370
I think it is better.
I don't know. Th the

523
00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:02.180
drive by aspect of commoning
comes really problematic. Like you

524
00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:04.580
have people that want to
do strafing runs on topics.

525
00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:06.170
Like they'll come to your
blog entry. They don't really

526
00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:09.200
give a shit about you
or your community. It's just,

527
00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:12.260
this topic sets them off
on some level and they

528
00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:13.860
just do a strafing run.
They're like, this is D

529
00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:16.130
you know, they just, they
post five times about how

530
00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:18.770
wrong you are and how
wrong everyone is about this

531
00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:20.960
now. Right. They are. And
then they just go away.

532
00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:23.510
You never ever see them
again. And that I think

533
00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:27.320
is kind of enabled by
this OnPage commenting model. It's

534
00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:30.470
particularly bad on news articles.
Like I feel bad. Cause

535
00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:33.470
Rob Connery had a and
used to work with Rob,

536
00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:38.300
right? He, he, there was
an article he's in Hawaii.

537
00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:44.450
There was a New York times
article about GMO stuff. I

538
00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:46.790
don't know how to describe
it. I can send you

539
00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:48.500
a link to it. But
it's a recent New York times

540
00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:52.220
article and Rob being in
Hawaii has just strong feelings

541
00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:55.490
about this. So Boeing Boeing,
one of our partners posted

542
00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:58.730
a blog entry about this
New York times article. And Rob

543
00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:01.460
started commenting on the discourse
side. He went, you know,

544
00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:05.130
he went, He was arguing
on disk on boiling point

545
00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:07.150
and he didn't tell him
what he's arguing about. So

546
00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:09.310
he, he went and he
opened the door, went to

547
00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:12.640
the side where the bouncy
houses are. Right. And in

548
00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:14.560
posted and he made some
good points. You can actually

549
00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:17.500
go to the topic and
read what Rob said, but

550
00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:20.590
he ran into something interesting
that we instituted recently because

551
00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:23.830
of the strafing run problem
that I talked about. I

552
00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:26.080
went through a period on
Boeing, Boeing. They posted about

553
00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:29.110
40, I don't know, 30
to 20 to 40 topics.

554
00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:31.450
Yeah. It's like a curated
link blog. They're very, very

555
00:25:31.450 --> 00:25:34.480
aggressive, Pretty active. I went
through a period of several

556
00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:37.600
months where I read every
single thing, every person posted

557
00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:41.020
to boiling point the articles
and the comments, because that

558
00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:43.780
was my job. Right. Like
the discourse, because they're our

559
00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:46.690
partner. And I want to
understand the social patterns and

560
00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:48.640
see what was actually happening
with the software that we

561
00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:50.680
wrote. Like, how was it
actually working? What kind of,

562
00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:53.620
what kind of discussions are
people actually having? And one

563
00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:57.160
of the patterns I noticed
was this, this problem where

564
00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:59.440
you have new users come
in, they don't know any

565
00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:02.890
of the history of whatever
this topic is on the

566
00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:05.560
community. Right? Like, let me
just give you a pro

567
00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:07.600
tip that this is not
the first time that GMO

568
00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:12.220
stuff has been discussed. Genetically
modified organisms, genetically modified organism,

569
00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:14.470
meaning, you know, crops that
have been modified to be

570
00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:17.740
more resistant to X or,
you know, there's a variety

571
00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:19.450
of, it means that's one
of the problems is like,

572
00:26:19.450 --> 00:26:21.700
what does it actually mean?
Super bananas, I guess some

573
00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:23.980
kind of fancy food. Okay.
I don't have a strong

574
00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:26.530
opinion of it either way.
Well, some people have very,

575
00:26:26.530 --> 00:26:29.110
very strong opinions about this
and it gets very polarized

576
00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:32.260
and a pattern that I
noticed it bling-bling time and

577
00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:34.060
time again was you would
have a new user come

578
00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:36.310
in very, very strong feelings
for better or worse. I'm

579
00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:38.110
not judging the people. I'm
just saying they have strong

580
00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:39.850
feelings, but they don't know
any of the history of

581
00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:43.290
this, this type of discussion,
whether it's a controversial or

582
00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:46.080
not, which obviously GMO really,
really is. If you've spent

583
00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:48.900
any time at all on
Moines, you would know like

584
00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:50.820
just GMO is like a
trigger word, if you will,

585
00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:58.160
Autism or vaccines. And you
know what, another interesting ones.

586
00:26:58.190 --> 00:27:00.440
And then when going, it's
cycling, there's a whole class

587
00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:03.500
of people that view cyclists
as dicks. And then there's

588
00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:05.450
the other class of people
that say, you know, cyclists

589
00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:09.530
are horribly abused by drivers,
right. And they don't get

590
00:27:09.530 --> 00:27:12.440
their due. And these two
people kind of hate each

591
00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:14.840
other. There's two groups of
people and they really disagree

592
00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:17.540
about fundamentals of the topic.
So anytime you talk about

593
00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:21.530
cycling or helmets or anything
related bicycles, you have, it's

594
00:27:21.530 --> 00:27:25.220
very contentious. Right. And that's
something you would know if

595
00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:27.890
you had been part of
the community. So what Rob

596
00:27:27.890 --> 00:27:31.580
ran into was we limit
new users to three posts

597
00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:33.980
in the same topic. Yeah.
He mentioned that because he

598
00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:36.710
went basically he went through
and was going, Oh, this

599
00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:38.960
answer, answer it, this answer,
answer, answer. And then he,

600
00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:42.440
he basically said, there's too
much gamification going on here.

601
00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:44.810
It was kind of like,
you've commented too many times

602
00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:48.230
too vigorously. Therefore we do
not value your opinion as

603
00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:50.900
much. It's kind of like
some of the more obscure

604
00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:54.380
rules that there are over
on, on hacker news. You

605
00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:56.480
know, I don't know the
different terms, but if you

606
00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:59.690
wander around on hacker news,
you'll see people getting shadow,

607
00:27:59.690 --> 00:28:02.210
banned and hell band and
this kind of band. And

608
00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:04.610
they can, they can post
things, but they can't post

609
00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:08.150
things about themselves. And there's
all these obscure rules. And

610
00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:10.730
all, you know, from a
user's perspective is that you're

611
00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:13.550
not appreciated or that's what
your perspective is, you know?

612
00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:15.980
So, so it's tricky and
this is configurable. So you

613
00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:17.750
can turn this off if
you want, but we try

614
00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:20.540
to ship discourse with safe
defaults, like old man defaults,

615
00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:22.730
like old men are gonna
install discourse like us and

616
00:28:22.730 --> 00:28:23.750
say, you know what? I
don't have time for all

617
00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:25.970
this crap. Just I install
it. And then I run

618
00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:28.100
away and you see this
a lot on forums. You

619
00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:30.320
see forums that get set
up and people set it

620
00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:33.230
up and then walk away
for months and months. And

621
00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:36.320
the forum gets ruined because
they it's filled with spam.

622
00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:40.220
It's still cold. Shut my
form down. Well, that's exactly

623
00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:42.110
what I'm talking about. So
on discourse, the reason we

624
00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:45.770
have somewhat, I would say
moderately strict, not strict, strict,

625
00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:48.110
not like stack overflow strict.
Cause it's, you know, again,

626
00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:50.960
it's a social place. It's
not about getting work done

627
00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:53.690
necessarily. It's about hanging out,
but you have to be,

628
00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:57.020
it's surprising like Robin ward
and I were talking that

629
00:28:57.020 --> 00:29:00.050
we've never seen a community
ruined by too many rules

630
00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:03.020
or too much moderation online.
The only place we've seen

631
00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:05.840
communities get ruined is when
they have no rules and

632
00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:09.260
no mater What is ruined.
Like one of the things

633
00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:11.840
I don't like is I'll,
I'll find something on a

634
00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:15.170
PHP, BB, and then I'll
search and I won't find

635
00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:17.510
something. And then I'll search
again. And it'll say, you

636
00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:19.730
can only search once every
five seconds. And it's like,

637
00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:24.470
wow, I'm getting, I'm getting
penalized for being fast. Yeah.

638
00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:28.640
Well that's just PHP, sucking
PHP, BB sucking particular. Yeah.

639
00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:30.890
So that's another thing we're
trying to address is our

640
00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:33.290
searches. You know, it's still
evolving, but it's already, I

641
00:29:33.290 --> 00:29:35.390
think better than what's out
there. But to answer your

642
00:29:35.390 --> 00:29:38.840
question, what ruins a forum?
Well, spam obviously spam is

643
00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:42.940
self-evidently ruining right weeds growing
in your right. Second. The

644
00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:45.040
plants may just die. You
may not have enough people

645
00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:46.750
coming by. And then it's
just, it's just empty. It's

646
00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:49.390
like they didn't, you didn't
engage because for example, on,

647
00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:52.750
on most default forums, although
this, this is improving somewhat,

648
00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:55.060
like you don't even know
if somebody replied to you.

649
00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:58.540
I've had this experience so
many times where I go

650
00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:00.160
to some forum. I don't
use too much. Cause there's

651
00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:02.260
experts there on some topic
that I want to talk

652
00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:04.690
about and I post something
and then there's a bunch

653
00:30:04.690 --> 00:30:06.700
of responses, but I don't
know because I don't get

654
00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:09.490
emails. I don't get, I
guess basically emailed, I guess

655
00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:11.560
you'd have to email at
that point, but I don't

656
00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:15.910
know. And so the reason
your, your garden would die

657
00:30:15.910 --> 00:30:18.370
as the plants die because
you know, nobody's upkeeping them,

658
00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:20.590
right? It's like, Oh, this
guy responded to you. Oh,

659
00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:22.690
this, this woman responded to
you. Oh, this is interesting.

660
00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:25.090
Somebody mentioned your name, all
that stuff that we really

661
00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:28.090
take for granted now does
actually work on discourse. That's

662
00:30:28.090 --> 00:30:30.820
another reason the garden could
die. And then another more

663
00:30:30.910 --> 00:30:33.400
interesting reason your garden could
die is you have plants

664
00:30:34.090 --> 00:30:37.420
that become too dominant in
the garden. And this relates

665
00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:39.400
to the strafing run where
if some people come in

666
00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:42.880
and just have really, really
strong feelings about stuff and

667
00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:46.780
really dominate the discussion in
a way that's unhealthy, just

668
00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:49.510
like one plant taking over
your garden would be unhealthy

669
00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:51.430
for your garden. Presumably you
want a garden that has

670
00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:53.620
a variety of different things
that you want to eat.

671
00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:57.850
And a diversity of opinion
is really important. It's just

672
00:30:57.850 --> 00:31:00.430
like when I'm talking, eventually
I stopped. I know I've

673
00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:02.290
been talking a lot and
I apologize, but I pause

674
00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:03.850
and then you talk and
then we listen and I

675
00:31:03.850 --> 00:31:06.910
listened to what you're saying.
We alternate between talking and

676
00:31:06.910 --> 00:31:10.650
listening. Yes. The more you're
replying Or talking and waiting

677
00:31:10.650 --> 00:31:14.340
for your turn to talk.
Yeah, I know it's not

678
00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:17.790
always ideal. And particularly here,
you know, pontificating on things

679
00:31:17.790 --> 00:31:21.180
and I apologize, but in
a more normal non podcast

680
00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:24.180
type conversation, you and I
were having, there would be

681
00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:27.240
a lot of pausing and
listening. And if someone's not

682
00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:29.640
pausing, then that's what this
software is trying to say.

683
00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:31.650
Hey, look, in fact, we
do this. Like if you

684
00:31:31.650 --> 00:31:34.110
post too much in, in
a topic, let's say you,

685
00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:36.510
you're not a new user.
That's a new user sandbox

686
00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:38.760
that Rob ran into that
only applies to new users

687
00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:40.320
that doesn't apply to people
that show up every day

688
00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:42.090
and read a bunch of
stuff. They're not limited to

689
00:31:42.090 --> 00:31:46.860
three posts per topic. But
if, if, if Robin went

690
00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:49.710
in, I apologize for singling
you out, Rob, I don't

691
00:31:50.410 --> 00:31:53.100
actually, I want to be
clear here. What Rob said

692
00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:55.410
in that topic I thought
was perfectly fine. I thought

693
00:31:55.410 --> 00:31:57.300
he made a really good
set of points and his

694
00:31:57.300 --> 00:32:00.480
three replies and you know,
it was clear. I mean,

695
00:32:00.490 --> 00:32:03.600
I thought he explained himself,
well, it wasn't unclear to

696
00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:05.160
me and what he was
trying to say. And I

697
00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:08.000
had no problem with what
he was saying, but you

698
00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:10.140
kind of want to walk
away. Cause I do this.

699
00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:12.210
Like I'm, I'm a, you
know, tell people they're wrong

700
00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:13.800
on the internet kind of
guy. You know that, I

701
00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:15.990
mean, we have blogs. That's
kind of what we do,

702
00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:18.330
right? Like we're opinionated about
this stuff. And I have

703
00:32:18.330 --> 00:32:21.360
to force myself to walk
away and give other people

704
00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:22.740
time to response. I don't
want to be the guy

705
00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:25.710
who's responding to every little
thing someone says with, Oh,

706
00:32:25.770 --> 00:32:27.420
here's why you're wrong. Or,
Oh, let me just point

707
00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:30.030
out that this and this
and this, right. It's not

708
00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:32.590
a very, If someone is
wrong on the internet, I

709
00:32:32.610 --> 00:32:37.590
simply don't. I simply don't
do it. I Robin, we're

710
00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:40.430
talking about Rob now, but
I, the same thing I,

711
00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:42.860
I tell him, dude, this
doesn't matter. Just don't have

712
00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:45.620
that argument. Like when was,
and I think maybe you

713
00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:47.120
and I disagree a little
bit on this, but I

714
00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:51.110
don't personally argue some, I
don't, I don't argue much

715
00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:53.480
on the internet because the
chances are like, I can't

716
00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:55.940
even think of the last
time that I convinced someone

717
00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:58.550
to change their opinion. You
know what I mean? Like,

718
00:32:58.550 --> 00:33:02.350
thank goodness you argued with
me. That's right. And that's

719
00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:04.720
an excellent, you bring up
an amazingly excellent point, which

720
00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:07.420
is what is the point
of this discussion, right? The

721
00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:10.930
idea is that you adapt
your opinion over time. You

722
00:33:10.930 --> 00:33:14.230
know, you don't necessarily need
to change at three 67

723
00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:16.780
20, or whatever the rotation
for spinning and pair wedding

724
00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:22.990
around here. Yeah. We, we
learn. Right. And we adapt

725
00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:24.820
like, let me give you
a specific example. So we

726
00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:27.760
had one of those bicycling
conversations on VBS and it

727
00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:30.220
was about helmets. And to
me, it's, self-evidently obvious that

728
00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:33.070
people on bicycle should wear
a helmet. I'm not saying

729
00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:35.110
you should go arrest someone
when they're not wearing a

730
00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:38.200
helmet on a bicycle, but
it seems so for lack

731
00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:40.570
of a better word, moronic
to ride a bicycle without

732
00:33:40.570 --> 00:33:44.350
a helmet. Okay. Well I
know. And then I looked

733
00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:46.090
at the data and people
were saying, no, you're wrong

734
00:33:46.090 --> 00:33:48.310
about this. I was like,
well, and rather than reflexively

735
00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:49.930
say, no, you're wrong. No,
you're wrong. I was like,

736
00:33:49.930 --> 00:33:51.220
well, let's go look at
some of the data. Let

737
00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:53.860
me think about what you're
saying. And I looked at

738
00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:56.920
the data and there's actually
more acts way more accidental

739
00:33:56.920 --> 00:34:00.310
deaths in the U S
than cycling deaths. Like by

740
00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:02.620
a huge number. I think
there's like, basically I have

741
00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:03.670
to go look at the
topic, but I want to

742
00:34:03.670 --> 00:34:07.570
say around 2000 deaths per
year cycling, like more people

743
00:34:07.570 --> 00:34:11.200
get electrocuted than die from
bicycle accidents in the U

744
00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:15.280
S and in the UK,
it's even less. So the

745
00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:18.520
epidemiologists were saying that, you
know, if you, if you

746
00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:21.160
don't require people to wear
a helmet, more people will

747
00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:24.010
ride bicycles. Some of them
will get hurt. Yes. But

748
00:34:24.010 --> 00:34:28.030
the health benefits to society
are greater than the helmet

749
00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:29.950
benefits. And I was like,
that's such a weird argument.

750
00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:32.560
But if you look at
the data, the numbers are

751
00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:34.960
just so small from the
deaths and cycles that it

752
00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:37.060
starts to kind of make
sense because who, it doesn't

753
00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:39.340
matter. Right. Like wearing a
helmet, not wearing a helmet,

754
00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:42.970
certain types of accidents there,
it doesn't matter if you're

755
00:34:42.970 --> 00:34:46.150
wearing a helmet, you're kind
of toast regardless. Right. Which

756
00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:48.340
is, I don't want to
get morbid, but it can

757
00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:51.220
be weird. And yeah. So
I just thought it was

758
00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:54.400
interesting that I had really
adapted my opinion on this.

759
00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:56.050
Like I would no longer
say, yes, you must wear

760
00:34:56.050 --> 00:34:57.680
a helmet. If you say
no, then you're an idiot.

761
00:34:57.700 --> 00:35:00.400
Yeah. I think that the,
the, the argument's really simple

762
00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:03.250
that you have helmets for
anyone under 18. And when

763
00:35:03.250 --> 00:35:04.600
they're old enough to make
the choice to make the

764
00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:07.300
choice, you know, I mean,
like there was a really

765
00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:10.720
great, there was a really
tragic thing, tragic and or

766
00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:13.150
ironic. I think it was
an older gentleman. Who's in

767
00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:15.850
his fifties, there's a motorcycle
guy who was in a

768
00:35:15.850 --> 00:35:20.920
parade for wearing, you know,
choice and wearing helmets going

769
00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:23.140
about five miles an hour,
fell off and hit his

770
00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:26.830
head and died. And all
of the people feel bad.

771
00:35:27.010 --> 00:35:28.930
I know, but it's very
sad. All of the people

772
00:35:28.930 --> 00:35:30.910
who support everyone should wear
a helmet where like he

773
00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:33.760
could have been saved. And
all of the people who

774
00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:35.890
support not wearing a helmet
were like, well, he died

775
00:35:35.890 --> 00:35:39.120
with choice. Is it doesn't
make it any less tragic.

776
00:35:39.330 --> 00:35:40.860
I mean, he literally fell
off his bike at like

777
00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:42.090
five miles an hour and
hit his head on the

778
00:35:42.090 --> 00:35:45.770
curb. Well, as, as a
more dramatic example of where

779
00:35:45.770 --> 00:35:47.570
you can get this very
wrong, it's like we had

780
00:35:47.570 --> 00:35:49.700
nine 11, you know, a
certain number of people died.

781
00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:52.940
And then we made all
these changes to American society

782
00:35:53.930 --> 00:35:57.590
that caused a lot of
problems. And you might argue

783
00:35:57.590 --> 00:36:00.350
that what is the value?
You know, yes, some people

784
00:36:00.350 --> 00:36:02.690
died, but how many people
are going to die versus

785
00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:05.930
the effect of this change
you're gonna make. And it's

786
00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:09.350
a way less extreme example,
obviously bicycle helmets, but it's

787
00:36:09.350 --> 00:36:11.690
kind of the same sort
of line of thinking. And

788
00:36:11.690 --> 00:36:13.550
you can certainly see like
the travel stuff and it

789
00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:17.120
becomes, so honorous now that,
you know, cycling helmets could

790
00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:18.680
be a similar scenario. If
you made it really easy

791
00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:22.070
to ride a bicycle, maybe
more people would When I

792
00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:24.800
go to, when I go
through security, I just like,

793
00:36:24.830 --> 00:36:27.110
it's the same people. Like,
I want to just say,

794
00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:31.130
Hey, it's me guys. You
know what I mean? Like

795
00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:34.190
the Portland airport, like, yeah.
It's still me. Remember I

796
00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:38.120
was here yesterday. No, no,
take your, take your bag

797
00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:42.380
apart guys. Can we have
build something on relationships? It's

798
00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:45.740
I'm really seriously. It's still
me. I'm right here. Anyway,

799
00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:47.120
I do want to apologize
to Rob. I didn't wanna

800
00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:50.330
make them feel like I'm
able to, you know, say

801
00:36:50.530 --> 00:36:53.270
peace, but you guys can
read the topic and see

802
00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:56.640
for yourself. And the vast
library of GMO topics that

803
00:36:56.760 --> 00:37:00.080
we have at Boeing, Boeing
Is, is boy, if someone

804
00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:02.060
wants to play with this
course, should they install it?

805
00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:03.740
Or should they go to
boiling point? Like what, where

806
00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:06.650
are you guys at? If
you want to see real

807
00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:09.350
life examples, our two partners
are how to geek, how

808
00:37:09.350 --> 00:37:11.750
to geek.com, which is, I
love that site. I love

809
00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:15.710
lo he's great and going
boeing.net. Okay. Just click on

810
00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:17.570
the forum link. And I
think it is good to

811
00:37:17.570 --> 00:37:19.430
see it live. If you
want a sandbox where you

812
00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:25.220
can just, you know, post
and mess around discourse.org, there's

813
00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:26.990
a big, try it button.
You can try that. And

814
00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:28.460
that's reset every day. So
you don't have to worry

815
00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:31.280
about, you know, the wrath
of the internet coming down

816
00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:33.410
on any, if you post
the wrong thing, you can

817
00:37:33.410 --> 00:37:35.840
play. And then it's just
an open source project on

818
00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:39.500
GitHub. And we're ramping to
version 1.0 No, we shouldn't

819
00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:41.270
install it and run it
on our own systems. Quite

820
00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:45.920
yet. You don't think It's
pretty good now, like we've,

821
00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:48.410
we're, we're getting there. I
would, I, I'm less hesitant

822
00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:50.520
about telling people to play
with it and install. It

823
00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:53.090
Told me like six months
ago that I shouldn't have

824
00:37:53.090 --> 00:37:55.250
gone in and installed it,
played with it as much

825
00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:57.860
as I did. Well, we
need fixes based on what

826
00:37:57.860 --> 00:38:00.830
you ran into. We added
default caching, which it's kind

827
00:38:00.830 --> 00:38:02.420
of a long story, but
we assumed there was another

828
00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:04.940
caching layer in front of
us. There was no caching

829
00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:07.580
in the code itself. Now
we kind of have both,

830
00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:10.040
the code has caching. Plus
you can add additional caching

831
00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:13.190
layers in front, if you
want to. Cause that's what

832
00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:15.620
kind of got you. Is
that right? I assumed like

833
00:38:15.650 --> 00:38:18.140
WordPress or like whatever it
would just figure itself out.

834
00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:21.350
Well, yeah. WordPress is a
model of caching has, you

835
00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:25.370
know, it's not well. So
in that sense, it was

836
00:38:25.370 --> 00:38:28.040
like where it breaks. So
if people go, I'm looking

837
00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:29.960
here now, if you go
to how to geek and

838
00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:31.880
just the right there at
the top, it says discussion.

839
00:38:31.890 --> 00:38:34.010
If you click on discussion,
it's still looks like how

840
00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:36.250
to geek. It looks exactly
how to keep the site.

841
00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:39.010
Won't change a lot, but
you are looking at a

842
00:38:39.010 --> 00:38:42.100
discourse installation right there and
you can see their forums.

843
00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:44.380
Will you tell me when
it's time for me to

844
00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:48.820
bring Hanselman forums back? Definitely
because I think they would

845
00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:50.920
survive on discourse forums. If
you installed them and walked

846
00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:54.250
away, it would you'd have
a reasonable little garden. That

847
00:38:54.250 --> 00:38:56.050
would be really neat. Cause
I had to pull weeds

848
00:38:56.470 --> 00:38:59.200
all the time. Yeah, no,
totally. And that's, that's, what's

849
00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:02.110
about sustainable gardens, right? That
kind of have a fence

850
00:39:02.110 --> 00:39:03.760
and maintain themselves. It's not
like creating a bunch of

851
00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:06.190
work for you. Right. I'm
looking forward to it. That's

852
00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:10.360
great. So discourse.org, Boeing, Boeing,
and how to geek and

853
00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:14.680
also of course, as always
a coding horror.com. That's right.

854
00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:16.840
Thank you so much, Jeff
Atwood, this has been another

855
00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:19.330
episode of Hansel minutes. We'll
see you again next week.

856
00:39:20.590 --> 00:39:28.330
