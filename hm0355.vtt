at Microsoft about how she
works accessibility and computing. Hi,

11
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.480
this is Scott Hanselman. This
is another episode of Hansel

12
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.150
minutes and I'm here on
campus at Microsoft, and I've

13
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.150
got the nice opportunity to
sit down with Jennifer Sumi,

14
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.560
Jenny lay flurry. Thank you.
Who is a senior director

15
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.270
in accessibility and customer experience
here at Microsoft and you

16
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.500
are deaf. Yes, but we're
doing a podcast. What an

17
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.860
amazing gift that is. I,
yeah, I, I don't know

18
00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.790
what to say to that.
So yes, I, my lost

19
00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.830
my hearing when I was
a small child. So I

20
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.910
lost my hearing three measles.
My sister was born without,

21
00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.170
with hearing loss as well.
My hearing is degenerated over

22
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.570
the years, so no, I
don't have a lot of

23
00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.660
hearing. You said your sister
was born without hearing, but

24
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.090
you lost yours through measles.
Is that a coincidence or

25
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.100
do you think you were
genetically destined to happen here?

26
00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.820
Really? They, they would say
it was a coincidence, but

27
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.400
given the propensity of hearing
loss in my family, I've

28
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.230
got uncles and family members
who also have lost. And

29
00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.810
my dad even has some
loss. Yeah, it's a little

30
00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.370
confusing, but it's just the
way we lived. And we

31
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:14.240
left You're you're accenting. Your
intonation of your words is

32
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.260
not a typical deaf person
or what, at least myself

33
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.230
as a hearing person would
expect a person with deafness

34
00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.660
to sound like, how did
you manage that? And is

35
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.850
that a good thing or
a bad thing? Well, for

36
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.660
me it works great. I'm
what we kind of turned

37
00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:35.090
deceptive deaf. So in terms
of how you walking in

38
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.400
my office and meeting me,
you would never know that

39
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.160
I have deafness. My sister
on the other hand is

40
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.310
someone who's visually deaf. She
wears hearing AIDS. Her speech

41
00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.170
is more pronounced. And, but
at times she hears a

42
00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.210
lot more than I do.
I'm a lip reader. I

43
00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.130
learned liberating from my mother
when I was a small

44
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.050
child. And my hearing at
that point was probably 60%

45
00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.070
down. It's gradually slid the
years. I'm not going to

46
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.560
tell you how old I
am, but it's just meant

47
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.160
that I learned a certain
way of understanding my world.

48
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.830
I went on to get
a music degree. I think

49
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.000
my music degree, I was
a clarinet player really helped

50
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.160
me with vibration acoustics, intonation,
and really understanding how my

51
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.100
voice presents itself. And so
it's a lot of work.

52
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.780
I don't keep intonation in
my voice without work. It

53
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.690
takes work and constant reiteration,
but it gives me a

54
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.810
whole ton of benefits that
come out the other side,

55
00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.430
Since you, you know, ASL
American sign language, right? I

56
00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.720
know pigeon Asli would never
say I'm an ASL speaker.

57
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.230
I know enough to get
by. Yeah. That's an interesting

58
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.220
bridge because I know that
in America and perhaps less

59
00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.800
so in other countries that
people who are heart, what

60
00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.450
they call hardcore, Duffy's true.
Deaf culture advocates feel very

61
00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.630
strongly about their, their role
in the world. And here

62
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.810
you are with a foot
in each world almost. Is

63
00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.230
that an inappropriate thing to
say? I think anything can

64
00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.920
be said, I Does that
offend you inappropriately. I'm sorry.

65
00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.110
I'm not easily offended. You
have to try harder than

66
00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.990
that. I think a couple
of things with bring it.

67
00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.320
So I, you know, a
couple of things with deafness.

68
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.500
I honestly think that the
hardest space when it comes

69
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.530
to deafness, I think every
disability is different. How it

70
00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.640
manifests in people is different.
Everyone has their own version

71
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.150
of that reality. My grandmother's
96. She would say her

72
00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.540
hearing is beautiful. I can
tell you that it's not,

73
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.650
you know, that it manifests
different for every person. Just

74
00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.440
look at me and my
sister and the way that

75
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.460
I learned, because my hearing
gradually sled, I learned all

76
00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.230
the techniques that are a
moderately, mild deaf person would

77
00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:58.080
learn. They learned liberating, how
to communicate in a room.

78
00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.930
I think sitting in an
orchestra was probably the biggest

79
00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.560
thing that helped me understanding
how to watch people, the

80
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.900
way that you have to
when you're, when you're a

81
00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.950
musician, but as I've sled,
the way that I now

82
00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:16.050
work at Microsoft is leveraging
some of those techniques, which

83
00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.200
is where I learned BSL.
Again, pigeon, I would never

84
00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.900
say I was an expert.
So British sign language and

85
00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.240
then changed to American sign
language when I moved over

86
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.950
here. So no I it's.
Every deaf person has what

87
00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:32.760
works for them. And I
respect that. The reason I

88
00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.860
ask is that what I
learned when we learned sign

89
00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.920
language, my wife and I,
with my son growing up,

90
00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:41.370
we did baby sign language.
And we wanted him to

91
00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.650
be able to communicate before
he could speak. And the

92
00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:47.070
person that we learned from
was a deaf professor who

93
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.860
did not speak. And that
kind of was my first

94
00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.750
introduction to deaf culture. And
he had almost exclusively deaf

95
00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:58.460
friends. His whole world was
a deaf world and it

96
00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:02.180
was inconvenient for him to
step out. You said you

97
00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.880
used the term deceptively deaf,
which I think is a

98
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:09.650
really interesting term because if
you, if you look at

99
00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:11.810
you or if you look
at someone who is deceptively,

100
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:16.280
anything you can't really tell,
I mean, I'm deceptively diabetic

101
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:19.670
and it doesn't become a
problem unless I'm overseas with

102
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:21.290
a friend and I need
some sugar and I need

103
00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:23.300
it right now. And then
suddenly I went from being

104
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.330
able bodied Scott to incredibly
disabled. I need help right

105
00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:30.140
now, Scott. And that has
been my foot in one

106
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:33.560
world and a foot in
the other world. Do you,

107
00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:35.990
is it sliding to the
point where you're going to

108
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:42.070
become profoundly deaf, completely deaf?
So I'm a firm believer

109
00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:45.910
that science and medicine is
not the be all and

110
00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:50.020
end all. If I believe
the doctors, I would have

111
00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:54.310
not been able to speak
about 20 years ago and

112
00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:58.660
I'm so bunk, as far
as I'm concerned, I, I

113
00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:02.020
do believe that, you know,
my hearing loss is degrading.

114
00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:05.980
My, and that's a medical
fact. My speech is degrading.

115
00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:09.520
It's worse now than it
was five years ago. And

116
00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:12.160
it's difficult for me to
navigate in some environments. And

117
00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.230
that means that for me,
there are certain things that

118
00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:16.600
I know I'm going to
be successful at, but put

119
00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.450
me in a darkened room
with a bunch of people

120
00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:24.430
speaking and foreign accents and
things. And that I'm, I'm,

121
00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:27.880
that's one. It's not going
to be fun. And two,

122
00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:30.130
I'm not going to be
successful. So I get picky

123
00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:35.050
with how I communicate, but
I am not my deafness.

124
00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:37.900
And the way that I've
learned has enabled me to

125
00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:42.880
have, you know, my friends
are a mix. My environment

126
00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:47.290
is a mix. My partner
is hearing, my sister is

127
00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:50.530
not used. So I I'm
in that blended world. And

128
00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:55.000
I respect people in the
community as every type of

129
00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:01.090
disability where they're not able
or choose not to commute,

130
00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:04.120
you know, be in that
blended environment. That is a

131
00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:07.360
tough gig, I think. But
there's nothing to say. People

132
00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:10.660
can't again, be enabled to
be completely successful. And there's

133
00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:13.600
many, many people out there
who are, So we're not

134
00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.910
alone here in the room.
And if there's a pause,

135
00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:17.920
as we, as we speak,
it's because you have, you

136
00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:20.530
have a helper who is
your helper and what is

137
00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:23.710
her job Helper? I'm not
sure if you'd like to

138
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:26.260
be called a helper. The
lender is it, Belinda's in

139
00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:30.460
the room as well. She's,
she's my ASL interpreter. I

140
00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:35.230
have a group that helped
me a group that helped

141
00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:41.170
me and they will, they
will transition depending on what's

142
00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:43.390
going on in my calendar.
They won't speak, I wasn't

143
00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:44.890
looking for her to speak.
I was interested in the

144
00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:50.740
sounds of her fingers. Go
for it. Can I put

145
00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:53.200
the microphone next to it
while she translates? No idea

146
00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.740
that that makes a sound.
Does he make a sound?

147
00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:59.390
It makes us admit there's
a, there's a sense of,

148
00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:01.490
of quickness to it. It
adds, there's a sense of

149
00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:05.330
tempo, a sense of there's
a musicality to it because

150
00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:08.270
she is not in my
peripheral vision, but I'm hearing

151
00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:11.770
a, a movement and a
friction on her hand. And

152
00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:13.850
just trying to explain that
to a deaf girl. Yeah.

153
00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:16.520
I'm trying to display it
to a former deaf musician,

154
00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:19.190
a deaf musician with a
sense of tempo. No, that's

155
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:22.070
I, I had no idea.
It's just, it's funny. We,

156
00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:25.430
we had a deaf education
class last week with another

157
00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:29.210
employee I was running and
she talked about how she

158
00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:31.580
was sitting with her partner
the night before, and her

159
00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:34.550
partner could hear static electricity.
And both of us were

160
00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:36.650
cracking up because neither of
us knew that that made

161
00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:41.780
her. So I respect that
When a hearing person who

162
00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:43.820
is interested in deaf culture
like myself and like my

163
00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:47.480
wife and my family see
different people talking, you know,

164
00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:48.620
you're at of, you know,
how it is, you're at

165
00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:50.720
red Robin. And then there
are, there's deaf couple over

166
00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:53.170
there where there's a young
person talking to their, their

167
00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:56.870
friend. Each person has a
tempo and a musicality to

168
00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:00.620
their hands. And then some
vocalize when they speak. And

169
00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:02.990
there is music in that,
not just in the visual

170
00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:05.750
visual music, but in the
sound of the deafness and

171
00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:09.080
that the, the vocalization that
doesn't sound like anything. It's

172
00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:11.780
not any sound. It's not
English that comes out of

173
00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:13.760
their mouth. So that's what
I was trying to capture

174
00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:15.830
there with, with Belinda. Not
in any way to intrude

175
00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:18.530
on her. No, no, no.
I should explain the ethics

176
00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:23.540
behind interpreters are that they,
cause I see, I saw

177
00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:26.570
you putting the microphone towards
her and you know, you

178
00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:29.810
could see her shaking her
head and because the ethics

179
00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:33.650
actually dictate that that really
I am the voice and

180
00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:36.950
they are the enabler. And
I I'm so fortunate to

181
00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:40.490
have, I I'm being honest
and I shouldn't tell them

182
00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:42.230
they'll get big heads, but
they are some of the

183
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:46.790
best interpreters I've ever worked
with, which is so important

184
00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:51.470
to my role here at
Microsoft and know my ability

185
00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:55.880
to perform and be successful
in that company is really

186
00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:58.280
down to these guys. You
know, anytime that we get

187
00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:01.370
plaudits for what we're doing,
it's really these guys. Cause

188
00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:03.020
I wouldn't be able to
do what I do everyday

189
00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:05.690
without them. So now they're
gone red. We can move

190
00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:08.720
on. But yeah, I use
a variety of different accommodations

191
00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:11.360
of which a bell, the
lender, and a couple of

192
00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:15.650
my others are. And you,
you schedule your day and

193
00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:17.660
your meetings, do you, do
you have to front load

194
00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:19.070
them or load them in
such a way so that

195
00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:20.660
you know, that you have
support at the meetings that

196
00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:24.740
you need support at? So
the way my, my calendar,

197
00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:26.540
I wish I had control
enough to be able to

198
00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:29.630
do that. You don't always
get to dictate what's on

199
00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:32.810
your calendar. When bosses call
meetings, you have to run.

200
00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:36.650
But I, there are things
that we do. We categorize

201
00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:41.060
meetings as they come in,
they get categorized ABCD. If

202
00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:43.520
it's an AA meeting, I
missing, you know, meeting with

203
00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:46.970
the executives of the company,
they're going to talk fast.

204
00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:48.470
They're going to talk with
a lot of people in

205
00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:51.920
the room. I'll have two
interpreters sitting with me and

206
00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:55.750
they'll be rotating 15, 20
minutes on and off B.

207
00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:58.570
Then it's just like we
have here, Belinda and I,

208
00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:03.160
and yourself, she'll be here
for the whole duration. And

209
00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:05.800
we know each other well
enough to know how to

210
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:12.370
make this groove. And then
C is captioning and we

211
00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:15.250
use two different types of
captioning. So we use a

212
00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:19.150
onsite where a lady will
come or Jen with a

213
00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:23.100
sonographer like you see in
a court, The court reporter,

214
00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:26.460
and they're there. Okay. Now
I can either sit and

215
00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:29.100
look at their screen or
if I'm on a conference

216
00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:33.840
call, then I'll just log
onto an IE page. And

217
00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:39.090
the captions of what's being
said will appear little, little

218
00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:42.660
lag. You know, you got
a little lag, but it's

219
00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:46.200
like watching captions on your
TV and then damn on

220
00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:49.210
my own. If that's someone
I know well, and I,

221
00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:52.740
I feel comfortable with my
lip reading of them, or

222
00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:56.160
I'm comfortable that if for
any reason we'll switch, we

223
00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.710
often switched to instant communicator.
If we need to or

224
00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:02.670
whiteboards or whatever works. That's
the joy of working in

225
00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:07.500
a company like Microsoft technology
comes in back. I have

226
00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:12.210
the captions on, on my
TV, maybe 30% of the

227
00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:14.700
time, 40% of the time.
And often we'll stop our

228
00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:18.300
TV backup, turn it on.
And I've found them to

229
00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:21.300
be rather disappointing. I feel
like for some shows I'm

230
00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:23.520
missing out. Like I'm like,
I don't think he said

231
00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:26.100
that and that's not right.
I mean, do you ever

232
00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:29.400
feel like you're only getting
90% of the story and

233
00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:34.230
that there's some subtle nuance
that's being missed? Yeah. It's

234
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:39.240
kinda funny. I'll just tell
you a little story. I

235
00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:41.760
go to, I love the
movies. I, in fact, I'm

236
00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:45.180
a huge Oscars buff. So
I've got a lot of

237
00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:47.070
movies to watch in the
next couple of months for

238
00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:50.250
the Oscars, the movie theater
that I go to, I

239
00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:52.770
get a captioning machine, I
get my driver's license. They

240
00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:54.900
give me a captioning machine.
I sit in my seat

241
00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:59.130
and it sits into the
coffee stand and it shows

242
00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:03.330
captioned. And often I'll see
a movie more than once

243
00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:07.350
now, the first time sometimes
those machines aren't available or

244
00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:10.140
they're broken, it's new technology.
They haven't worked out with

245
00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:13.440
the King yet. So that's
when I'll see movie twice

246
00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:15.720
and I'll see it without
the captions. And I think

247
00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:17.880
I've got it. I think
I've got that script down.

248
00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:20.640
When in actual fact, all
I'm doing is focusing on

249
00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:24.030
James Bond. I'm not, you know,
I, I clearly am missing

250
00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:28.020
stuff, but I don't know.
You cannot lip read someone

251
00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:31.260
in a movie it's very,
very hard to do. So

252
00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:34.110
I'll be making up the
script, which is often more

253
00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:37.290
imaginative than what they're actually
talking about, but I'll see

254
00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:39.510
it twice so that I
can really understand it. So

255
00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:43.860
in those environments, sometimes you
will be clearly knowing that

256
00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:46.830
you're missing stuff other times
not, and you will be

257
00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:50.310
amazed how much fluff there
is in television programs and

258
00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:53.480
movies that I think my
world is better not knowing

259
00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:57.830
about it makes it simpler,
quicker and smarter. And I'm

260
00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:00.680
pretty good at filling in
gaps. Yeah, I think Def

261
00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:03.620
is being is much more
like a jigsaw puzzle than

262
00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:07.570
people realize. That's interesting. When
I think about captioning that

263
00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:10.510
has been formalized, like a,
like a one hour drama,

264
00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:14.560
that capsuling is almost always
correct, but captioning of like

265
00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:17.440
the morning news show, when
they're, you know, when they're

266
00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:21.820
having a chat back and
forth, I find that the

267
00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:25.990
amount of information contained in
the average person's sentence, the

268
00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:29.080
signal to noise is, you
know, maybe 50%, 60%, there's

269
00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:33.400
a lot of ums and
hems and Haws. Does your

270
00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:38.440
captioning system and, or your
interpreter cut out that, that,

271
00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:40.960
that chaff, and then leave
you only with the signal

272
00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:44.680
or do you see that
we are making up our

273
00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:48.670
sentence? Part of the, the
biggest, the worst thing you

274
00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:51.190
can do with a person
with deafness is do the,

275
00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:54.490
Oh, it wasn't important. You
know, I actually want to

276
00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:57.610
see the MZ Oz and
you know, you know, the

277
00:15:57.610 --> 00:16:00.640
pauses, the long pauses is
important for me because it

278
00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:04.240
tells me a lot of
what's going on. And so

279
00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:06.520
no, those are shown and
they're shown for a reason,

280
00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:11.950
what they'll get wrong is,
you know, names, places, things

281
00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:16.930
that particularly the nouns, right.
They'll get those wrong. What

282
00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:19.120
a lot of the live
shows do is they prep

283
00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:21.970
the captioners. They have the
transcript, the names, they know

284
00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:24.400
who's coming on, what the
timing is. They'll have the

285
00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:27.700
questions. That's when you know,
you've got a good setup

286
00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:31.510
when the company is working
with the captioners to make

287
00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:35.800
sure the accuracy is right.
But no, I really want

288
00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.990
that. And in fact, someone,
if someone's telling a joke

289
00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:42.160
and then what repeat it,
I'll get miffed. You know,

290
00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:44.500
the, the great thing about
being in a company like

291
00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:46.540
Microsoft is that I do
have the ability on a

292
00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:49.810
conference call to say, stop,
two of you are talking,

293
00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:52.480
come on, work out who
who's going to talk first,

294
00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:55.420
or you gotta repeat that.
We missed it. Or, you

295
00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:58.030
know, just spell it out.
What I have that I'm

296
00:16:58.030 --> 00:17:03.010
empowered to do that. And
yeah, I think part of

297
00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:06.250
having a disability is being
your own self advocate and

298
00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:11.440
having that confidence, even when
there's somebody who's scary on

299
00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:14.230
the, on that call, just
saying, you know what? I

300
00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:16.360
didn't catch it. And I
really want to understand what

301
00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:19.450
you're saying. So repeat it.
And you may laugh 20

302
00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:23.380
seconds after them, but Hey,
laughing twice I think is

303
00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:26.650
better than not laughing at
all. That confidence is hard

304
00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:30.250
to have because one of
the, and this is in

305
00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:32.770
quotes and error. One of
the disabilities I have is

306
00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:35.440
that I'm a remote worker.
So I live in Portland,

307
00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:39.400
Oregon, and I am, I
am simply a voice or

308
00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:44.770
I'm a tiny video square.
And they forget me. I've

309
00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:47.380
had times when they've left
the room and I can

310
00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:51.660
hear the sound of the
empty and like, okay, I,

311
00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:54.630
I need to do my
part in the standup now,

312
00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:58.500
guys, anyone, hello? Hello. And
it's very sad. And I

313
00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:01.590
think to myself, if I
had the confidence to be

314
00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:05.490
more assertive, then this would
not be a problem. But

315
00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:09.090
then there's the concern that
you're different. You're the remote

316
00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:13.950
person. And they'll think poorly
of you. Do you think

317
00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:18.750
that I'm trying to say
you don't feel bad that

318
00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:22.650
you're reminding people that there's
a missing piece when you

319
00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:24.960
make that assertion that, Hey,
I need to be heard

320
00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:27.420
because I feel as a
remote, I'm reminding them I'm

321
00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:31.620
remote. When I'm saying, please
have a camera on for

322
00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:34.860
me, please. I'm the remote
guy. You see the parallel

323
00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:39.350
I totally do. And I
think it's a human, it's

324
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:43.400
a human nature to an
insecurity. I it's a question.

325
00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:46.010
It's, it's something that you,
you know, I, trust me,

326
00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:49.850
I would rather not have
to do it, but his,

327
00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:51.740
he was, it was an
epiphany for me in my

328
00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:56.660
twenties, I think, which was
your, the realization that if

329
00:18:56.690 --> 00:19:03.890
I'm going to be successful
in life in Korea, then

330
00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:05.930
the only one who's going
to lose out by not

331
00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:10.550
speaking out is me. And
I, I'm very grounded in

332
00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:15.830
that. I am different and
I can't conform to some

333
00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:19.100
of the norms. I don't
think that's a bad thing.

334
00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:22.790
I actually think that what
we bring by being different

335
00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:27.620
in whatever way that is,
whether it's disability, gender, sexuality,

336
00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:33.140
whatever that is, bring something
else to the conversation. What

337
00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:35.420
I generally find when I
speak up is that it's,

338
00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:39.410
you actually add a level
of respect into the conversation

339
00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:44.390
that sometimes doesn't exist and
yeah, as many stereotypes exist

340
00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:47.600
about Microsoft, I can, I
can say we do talk

341
00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:51.170
fast and we do try
and talk over one another

342
00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:54.320
and we are all smart.
And sometimes you're saying, you

343
00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:56.780
know what? You gotta slow
it down. We're missing you.

344
00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:59.900
And I really want to
hear what you have to

345
00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:04.520
say. Just, it takes it
to a different level. You

346
00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:06.080
know, those that have worked
with me for a long

347
00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:09.440
time can sometimes be, get
as well. And I love

348
00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:13.490
that. Cause I like that
I can be deceptive and

349
00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:18.140
I hope that remains, who
knows. But I also love

350
00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:23.030
that it's a, I'm in
an environment where I do

351
00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:25.550
not feel uncomfortable saying that
there are moments, there are

352
00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:29.210
always moments the same as
a musician walking out on

353
00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:32.870
stage. You get those nerves,
but if you're grounded in

354
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:35.420
what you believe, then I,
I think he's actually all

355
00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:40.430
for the best. How, how
accommodating should, should people be?

356
00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:42.680
And I don't know if
the term is able bodied

357
00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:46.880
or regular or prototypical, what
is the term for the

358
00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:52.210
person that doesn't have any
different abilities? Like, I'll give

359
00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:56.440
you an example. My good
friend SOXHUB is blind. And

360
00:20:57.430 --> 00:21:02.140
he mentioned once, years ago,
six years ago that I

361
00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:05.800
wasn't putting any alt tags
on my graphics, on my

362
00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:11.380
website. Right. All text and
every single blog post, since

363
00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:14.080
then I have done that.
And I've even sometimes left

364
00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:17.740
little messages just for the
blind people in the all

365
00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:21.100
text. And whenever I write
a blog post, I think

366
00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:24.610
of my friend. And I
think what helpful piece of

367
00:21:24.610 --> 00:21:27.610
text should be here for
my friend. And I don't

368
00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:30.430
know if that's because I
have this friend or if

369
00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:33.400
it's, because I'm starting to
think about the world beyond

370
00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:36.640
just the able bodied. But
then that has a van

371
00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:40.180
that has got me thinking
about colorblind and icon design

372
00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:43.210
and captioning. I, I closed
caption all of my YouTube

373
00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:48.310
videos now. And it's so
tedious. It's so tedious. It

374
00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:51.190
takes hours and hours. Even
this show here, we have

375
00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:53.860
a court reporter who will
transcribe this into a PDF.

376
00:21:56.110 --> 00:22:00.100
And, but at what point
should that it does it

377
00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:02.740
does it, does it, does
it become an inconvenience? And

378
00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:05.020
I should just say, that's
enough enough people can see

379
00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:08.940
this. I don't think it,
I don't think it's ever

380
00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:13.050
enough. So I applaud you
for your effort. I think

381
00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:16.980
taking that time, if you
get one extra less, now

382
00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:21.330
one extra viewer. My firm
belief is that no effort

383
00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:24.660
is enough and it's always
worth it. Always worth it

384
00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:29.310
because you will bring in
some person who's never listened

385
00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:32.070
to you before who gets
a new, fresh perspective. Who's

386
00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:36.330
inspired to go and do
amazing things. I, I firmly

387
00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:38.820
firmly believe that, but that's
not to say that the

388
00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:40.860
technology is where we want
it to be. I would

389
00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:43.830
wish that closed captioning could
be a lot easier and

390
00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:47.970
a lot less cost. And
I hope that that's in

391
00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:52.080
our future, at least in
my short term future, to

392
00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:55.170
go to your, you know,
your first question about terminology.

393
00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:58.950
And I think terminology is
something that changes over time.

394
00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:02.820
The way that I think
about it now is different

395
00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:04.710
to where I thought about
it five years, 10 years

396
00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:09.120
ago. So the first principle
that I hold there is

397
00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:15.150
that we are people first.
I actually don't like anything

398
00:23:15.150 --> 00:23:19.560
that is disabled. I actually
don't like that time. That's

399
00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:23.790
my personal thing. I would
prefer. It's just pure syntax

400
00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:26.610
of it's a person with
a disability. So I'm actually

401
00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:31.260
a person. I'm a person
with hearing loss, a person

402
00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:35.820
who is blind, a person
with a mobility impairment. Now

403
00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:38.760
some people I, but you'll
also hear me say, I'm

404
00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:42.660
a deaf guy and you'll
hear somebody likes a keyboard.

405
00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:45.800
You know, others, that what
for me saying I'm blind

406
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:49.340
and I'm, that's totally okay
as well. That's what they

407
00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:52.070
choose to use. There are
certain words that you shouldn't

408
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:56.210
use. Handicap is actually moving
out of preference and out

409
00:23:56.210 --> 00:23:59.660
of fashion. And I, I,
I can see that I

410
00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:03.290
handy cap. I eat just
not a word that describes

411
00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:06.200
me. I would never use
that to refer to myself.

412
00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:10.010
But I think the, you
know, the first principle is

413
00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:11.900
there a person first and
then the lesson for their

414
00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:15.230
cues. You know, I think
the other thing with disability

415
00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:19.700
and etiquette is to lessen,
you know, and make the

416
00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:22.010
offer. If you see someone
who needs help with a

417
00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:24.080
door, but if they take
you up on it, great,

418
00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:26.990
they don't, don't be offended.
It may be they're working

419
00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:30.350
on that independent move of
opening a door, but make

420
00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:33.920
the offer. I also think
it's great to be curious.

421
00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:35.720
And, you know, just as
you've just said, how does

422
00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:38.360
it, you know, what, what
are you like? And it's

423
00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:40.580
great to be curious, cause
you'll find some people who

424
00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:45.320
perfectly confident and capable and
want to be termed as

425
00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:49.250
disabled. I, I don't. So
I, you know, I think

426
00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:52.210
being curious is also a
really great thing. What kind

427
00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:55.000
of things are you working
on yourself here in the

428
00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.510
area of accessibility to, to
improve things for other people

429
00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:02.620
like your job? Yeah, my
job is to look at

430
00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:07.180
the customer experience for accessibility
at Microsoft. It's a new

431
00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:10.210
position I've been here about
a year now. So I

432
00:25:10.210 --> 00:25:15.490
stepped out from managing support
service sales businesses. I did

433
00:25:15.490 --> 00:25:18.760
that for about 15 years.
So I come from a

434
00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:23.740
business background and I really
just got drawn into accessibility

435
00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:28.510
through my work leading the
disability resource group, employee resource

436
00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:33.010
group here at Microsoft and
forming that. So my work

437
00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:35.950
here is to look at
your a few key aspects

438
00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:41.410
of accessibility from a customer
lens. So holistically, I want

439
00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:43.660
accessibility to be part of
the air that we breathe.

440
00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:49.210
I want adding captions to
that, to that movie to

441
00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:53.710
be easy to do so
it's automated. It's, it's, it's

442
00:25:53.710 --> 00:25:58.600
just easily done. When we
look in, we have some

443
00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:01.570
amazing products are out there,
but how do we take

444
00:26:01.570 --> 00:26:03.790
them to the next level,
by looking at what customers

445
00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:07.540
have to say, how can
we support customers with disabilities?

446
00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:11.140
How can we support accessibility
in a different way? So

447
00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:15.010
we're researching in a few
places and driving certain initiatives

448
00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:19.210
in others, Just out of
curiosity, what have you done

449
00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:21.850
to your setup, your windows?
Do you use any of

450
00:26:21.850 --> 00:26:26.320
our accessibility things like when
the instant messenger beeps does

451
00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:28.090
it, this is a screen
flash for you or what

452
00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:32.080
are some things that you've
done to your windows? Not

453
00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:36.220
a lot. I find we
knows to be incredibly accessible.

454
00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:41.860
I use, I clearly don't
have sound notifications, but I,

455
00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:44.280
you know, I've been a
window user most of my

456
00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:48.210
life. And either if the
notification comes up in the

457
00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:49.890
bottom, right, I see it.
I don't need more than

458
00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:53.040
that. So I don't have
a ton that I need

459
00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:55.620
from a PC. What I
would love is that if

460
00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:58.650
I go on a conference
call any time it's instantly

461
00:26:58.650 --> 00:27:00.960
captioned, you know, there's things
like that, that I can

462
00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:03.870
imagine a new world. And
I know I speak for

463
00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:07.620
others in that. Whereas if
you have other disabilities, windows

464
00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:11.220
has some amazing features. So
in the ease of access

465
00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:13.740
center, if you are blind,
there is a screen reader

466
00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:18.570
built into windows. There are
mobility features. It's several features

467
00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:20.910
in there that are useful
to other aspects of disability.

468
00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:26.550
So my experience is not
is, is different as a

469
00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:29.900
person with deafness. Do you
have accessibility things in your,

470
00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:32.870
in your home, like lamps
that flash when the refund

471
00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:38.420
rings or what if the
fire alarm goes off? Yeah.

472
00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:41.360
I, the first accessibility device
I have is my partner.

473
00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:46.320
He's very well trained and
he will grab me. It's

474
00:27:46.330 --> 00:27:48.320
a serious thing though. You
have to let people know,

475
00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:49.800
you have to tell them.
You're like, you know, if,

476
00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:51.710
if there's a doorbell going,
not going to hear that,

477
00:27:53.030 --> 00:27:54.680
if there's a smoke alarm
going, I'm not going to

478
00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:57.800
hear that. And I also
try my kid, you know,

479
00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:02.030
I think it's she's five
and she gets it. She's

480
00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:04.280
like, mommy says, don't work.
That's how she talks to

481
00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:06.350
others about it. But she'll
come get me. If there's

482
00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:08.390
something at the door, she'll
come get me. If she

483
00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:11.330
hears something and a noise,
she'll also get me if

484
00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:14.510
there's a spider. So I
haven't got it quite down

485
00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:18.770
yet. But yeah, lights are
very important to me. Vibration

486
00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:22.430
is also very important to
me. So whether that's an

487
00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:26.270
alarm clock, strobes fire alarms,
when, when my kiddo was

488
00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:30.950
a baby, there's lots of
gadgets and toys. You can

489
00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:34.400
get just to light up
a room. So every time

490
00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:37.850
she cried, my lamp by
my bed would go off.

491
00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:41.660
So I had to gradually
tweak the sensitivity of that

492
00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:44.630
as the other. Cause trust
me, there was no sleep

493
00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:47.570
there for a while, but
like I'm sure everyone else,

494
00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:51.020
right? What cries can you,
I don't think that was

495
00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:53.340
just a hearing thing. What
cries can you let go?

496
00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:56.990
What cries? There's the I'm
injured and I've fallen on

497
00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.860
my head. Cry. I, but
it's not it's you can't

498
00:29:00.890 --> 00:29:03.830
distinguish so much. So you
had to just learn the

499
00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:08.570
decibel level from that, but
they learn pretty fast. So

500
00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:10.670
do you, as this is,
I'm going to go around

501
00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:13.190
the corner on this one.
Are you a safe driver?

502
00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:15.740
And when you use products,
like for example, a car,

503
00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:17.960
are you thinking about accessibility
and then how you're going

504
00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:20.300
to apply that back to
like products that we have?

505
00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:23.690
So yes, people who are
deaf contrived. Well, I know

506
00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:25.460
you can drive. I just
don't know whether you're going

507
00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:29.480
to hear me honking behind
you. No. Why? But that's

508
00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:34.070
a good thing, right? I
don't want to hear you

509
00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:36.740
hall. I have no interest
in that whatsoever. I'm trying

510
00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:39.680
to help you what I'm
sure. Then flashlights and that's

511
00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:42.940
actually what people do. So
I am very good at

512
00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:46.030
my marriage is very good
at, you know, yeah. There's

513
00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:49.060
a fallacy in dues and
other sense grow in another

514
00:29:49.090 --> 00:29:52.480
one. Another one is compromised.
The medical again, is that

515
00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:55.540
no, cos they don't. The
reality is yes they do.

516
00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:59.740
At least my personal view
because I do think you

517
00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:02.680
become just more aware of
body language in a room

518
00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:05.950
of light signals. And when
they go off, you know,

519
00:30:06.010 --> 00:30:08.620
my light signals will wake
me up in the morning.

520
00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:11.470
They don't wake up my
partner. So, you know, it's

521
00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:15.490
curious either that or he's
just ignoring them. So yeah,

522
00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:19.290
you become very observant. Yeah.
Do you, when you use

523
00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:22.890
consumer products or products that
aren't accessible, are you always

524
00:30:22.890 --> 00:30:25.950
kind of cataloging those in
your mind and then bringing

525
00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:29.040
those ideas back to work?
Cause you're you said that

526
00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:30.960
you were kind of a
customer advocate. I'm trying to

527
00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:33.360
understand how you take their
feedback and make sure that

528
00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:36.150
the product gets those ideas.
So there's a number of

529
00:30:36.150 --> 00:30:39.030
ways, very formally that we
get feedback. There's actually a

530
00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:43.110
survey that sits on our
microsoft.com/enable site. I get a

531
00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:46.500
lot of feedback from that.
So that's a, it's just

532
00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:48.360
a quick form where people
can go in and get

533
00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:51.960
that feedback on how important
is accessibility to you and

534
00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:54.630
how satisfied are you and
what is it you want

535
00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:57.570
to see? What is it
that's great. You know, give

536
00:30:57.570 --> 00:31:00.540
me some of those nuggets
of joy that will help

537
00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:03.960
me to think about that
future experience. We also get

538
00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:06.330
a ton of feedback through
a lot of our Microsoft

539
00:31:06.330 --> 00:31:10.470
properties. So anytime you're searching
for content, checking out content,

540
00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:14.970
knowledge articles, or you're speaking
to an agent, we get

541
00:31:14.970 --> 00:31:18.750
a lot of Intel from
that. And particularly if it's

542
00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:23.520
about an accessibility feature, you're
asking about that and we're

543
00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:26.100
trying to get much more
focused about their support for

544
00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:30.240
people with disabilities. And that's
an area of real data

545
00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:33.540
that we've had and data
that we need. So there's

546
00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:36.390
a lot of that. My
own experience of course comes

547
00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:38.760
in as does everyone on
the team that's working around

548
00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:43.590
me. So actually I had
a guy who's a colleague

549
00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:45.540
of mine who was at
CES last week part of

550
00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:49.860
my team and has come
back today talking about headphones,

551
00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:54.720
that relay sound through bone
conduction. So I, and I

552
00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:57.540
use these a lot during
my music degree. So the

553
00:31:57.540 --> 00:32:00.150
headphones that sit just behind
the ear on the bone,

554
00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:04.590
now it's unclear again, medically
how much you hear or

555
00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:07.530
how much you feel. It's
very hard to differentiate, but

556
00:32:07.530 --> 00:32:11.160
for me it takes music
to a different level. So,

557
00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:13.110
you know, there's lots of,
there was for the first

558
00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:20.040
time an accessibility, inclusiveness, a
wing to CS. So I'm

559
00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:22.780
looking forward to digging through
all of these things and

560
00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:25.740
an install that these guys
are brought back, but we

561
00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:28.830
also leverage the internal communities.
The other one, I would

562
00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:32.730
say we have people with
disabilities at Microsoft. We want

563
00:32:32.730 --> 00:32:37.680
more because they help us
to understand drive and build

564
00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:41.660
better products. It's comes back
to that whole philosophy around

565
00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:46.190
diversity. If you have a
diverse group of people, you

566
00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:51.590
will get diverse thinking and
that includes disability. So yeah,

567
00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:54.500
I, as chair, I'm fortunate
to an honor to really

568
00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:57.440
chair that group and how
we can connect them with

569
00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:01.700
product groups and whether it's
testing products, helping design products.

570
00:33:02.570 --> 00:33:05.230
It's a really important role
of what I do. Very

571
00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:08.110
cool. So I will put
links to some of these

572
00:33:08.110 --> 00:33:12.280
things in the show notes
like microsoft.com/enable, and you guys

573
00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:15.160
see those surveys. They don't
just go. I read every

574
00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:17.140
single one. All right. See,
I like to hear that.

575
00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:19.120
All right. Great. Well, thank
you so much for your

576
00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:22.960
time. Absolutely. Thank you for
your interest. This has been

577
00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:25.600
another episode of Hansel minutes
and we'll see you again

578
00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:26.230
next week.
