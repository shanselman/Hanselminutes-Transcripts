00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.430
Hey friends. I want to
introduce a new sponsor to

2
00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.520
you. H M a VPN.
It's a VPN you can

3
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.990
count on. As you know,
I do a lot of

4
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.330
travel and I tend to
connect to a lot of

5
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.600
untrusted wireless networks. And I
probably shouldn't, but I can

6
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.800
use HMA as the world's
largest VPN service offers. The

7
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.960
most server locations worldwide covers
190 countries. There's always a

8
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.290
server nearby it. Doesn't log
your IP address and allows

9
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.340
me to connect five devices
simultaneously works on basically all

10
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.350
platforms, Android, iOS, Mac, Linux,
windows routers, wherever it's actually

11
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.770
been completely redesigned recently to
make it even simpler and

12
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.440
more fun to use. And
there's even a smart kill

13
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.770
switch. That'll turn the VPN
automatically on when you launch

14
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.130
sensitive apps, here's your call
to action. My friends try

15
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.140
HMA VPN risk-free with a
30 day money back guarantee.

16
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:59.010
This deal is for Hanselman
its listeners. That's HMA, vpn.com/offer

17
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:19.940
hyphen Hansel minutes. That's HMA
vpn.com/offer-hansel minutes. Hey friends, this

18
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.130
is Scott Hanselman. This is
another episode of Hansel minutes

19
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.450
Of a sort. This is
a little different. This is

20
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.930
the first or second show
of 2020. And I thought

21
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.390
for the first time in
700 episodes, I would actually

22
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.420
have myself on the show.
Now I realize that's a

23
00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.760
super egotistical thing to do
considering that the show is

24
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.240
named after me. But I
recently did a kind of

25
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.580
a, a little little conference,
little internal conversation with a

26
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.520
group of folks that are
called the live coders. It's

27
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.970
part of Jeffrey Fritz's team
on Twitch. You can go

28
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:59.240
to twitch.tv/team/live coders. It's a
team of over a hundred

29
00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.610
folks that Twitch live, they
code and develop live in

30
00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.190
the open. And they were
kind enough to invite me

31
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.880
into their discord, their audio
chat channel. It's like IRC,

32
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.910
but for people that talk
and they ask me questions

33
00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.280
about building community and how
I manage my life and

34
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.530
how I do my blogging
and my podcast. And the

35
00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.980
result was about 50 minutes
of audio and about five

36
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.890
minutes of content. And someone
had the idea that maybe

37
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.880
we should make this a
podcast. So be warned, this

38
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.160
may suck, but at the
same time, it might be

39
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.230
useful. And I hope you
check it out. It is

40
00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.840
a longer show. It's about
50 minutes long. So bear

41
00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.130
with us, but I hope
that you enjoy this unusual

42
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.490
episode of Hansel minutes. So
you've had a lot of

43
00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:48.770
experience growing and managing communities.
A lot of the folks

44
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.290
that are here when we
were in that other voice

45
00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.740
channel, before we got started,
the folks were kind of

46
00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.770
impressed with how many folks
you have following you on

47
00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.210
Twitter. I mean, that's a
huge number And why people

48
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.440
are impressed with that, right?
It's about longevity. It's about

49
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:12.370
being mediocre for decades. If
people, the difference, the only

50
00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.940
difference between me and and
other people is that I

51
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.090
haven't stopped. And I've talked
about this. I gave a

52
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.740
talk in, where was I
last week? Estonia, one of

53
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.440
the Balkans, I can't remember.
And I was talking about

54
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.750
community. Everyone's like, Oh, you
know, I was doing, it's

55
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.730
really, it's awful. Now that
you're old because it's like,

56
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.590
Oh, I was doing your
book, reading your blog when

57
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.720
I was in high school.
And I'm like, Oh God,

58
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.950
but the blog has been
going since for 17 years,

59
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.280
the podcast has been going
for 14 years. What people

60
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.760
don't do when they set
up these, these communities, these

61
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.690
things is make them sustainable
because they create an unreasonable

62
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.260
expectation, right? You look at
every YouTube or every Twitter

63
00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.940
has burned out. And, but
I blog twice a week

64
00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.460
consistently for 20 years. And
I podcast every Thursday for

65
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.700
the last 15 years, 14
years. And the reason that

66
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.920
that works is that I'm
not doing it five days

67
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.310
a week. You know what
I mean? So I appreciate

68
00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:13.660
all the work that you
all are doing, but I've

69
00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.310
told you this personally, Jeff
privately, please don't burn out,

70
00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.670
you know, set up systems
by which your community can

71
00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:24.790
be self sustaining. And that
it does not require you

72
00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.830
to show up every single
day or you will burn

73
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.190
out. So the only difference
between me and everybody else

74
00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.130
is that I had never
stopped. And that really speaks

75
00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.560
to consistency. And I joke
about mediocrity. Some of my

76
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.170
things are mediocre. Some of
them are not, but I,

77
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.350
I am patting myself on
the back. Finally. I'm like,

78
00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.300
you know, old enough and
good enough at what I'm

79
00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.980
doing to be able to
like have a little bit

80
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.230
less imposter syndrome and a
little bit more confidence in

81
00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:51.490
what I'm doing. And that
is that I have had

82
00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.710
a consistent quality plus quality
for so many years. And

83
00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.140
that's, that's the thing, right?
Like, it will be interesting

84
00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.060
to see what Twitch looks
like in five years and

85
00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.730
in 10 years. And how
many of you continue to

86
00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:05.920
do it and not give
up. So it makes sense.

87
00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.910
It totally does. And actually,
you're, you're kind of feeding

88
00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.100
right into Robert table's question
here. I'm going to unmute

89
00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.410
him so that he can,
is that the whole body

90
00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.250
tails That is th this
is little Bobby tables. Let

91
00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.110
me unmute him. So we
can ask his question for

92
00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.230
you. I had a question
when you built a community,

93
00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.710
as you've done over the
years, you eventually hit kind

94
00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.070
of growing pains of any
company. So imagine you have

95
00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:34.080
a small group, like a
Dungeons and dragons group, or

96
00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.870
you have a small group
in your company that is

97
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.430
hyper focused on a thing
like usability or accessibility or

98
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:46.470
something. You know, something like
that. And you, when they

99
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:48.990
get very, very large, you
hit the growing pains of

100
00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.860
any company. Imagine you have
a hundred people, a hundred

101
00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:56.130
people in your kind of
community, all over the world

102
00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.840
with everyone, having their different
Ideas and things like that.

103
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:03.710
These are the same pain
points that companies had with

104
00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:10.160
scalability. Right. So how do
you view kind of delegating

105
00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:15.140
responsibilities for aspects of kind
of like a group or

106
00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:21.110
a community or managing expectations
when community mentorship is not

107
00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:24.560
even part of your role,
meaning you're kind of doing

108
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.420
this thing, like not part
of your job. Okay. So

109
00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:31.660
there's a couple of things
to parse there. First, there's

110
00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:35.230
the, what's your job and
what's not your job. That

111
00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:37.510
doesn't really matter. I mean,
it's just that people usually

112
00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:40.090
break it up into what
they are paid for and

113
00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:43.030
how much time they have
to spend on something. But

114
00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:45.580
those things are really come
down to just organizational willpower.

115
00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:48.220
I mean, I'm not paid
to blog. I'm not paid

116
00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:50.770
to podcast. I work for
the Microsoft, but I don't

117
00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:55.630
do either of those things
for work. But I do

118
00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:59.920
find time for those things
that are important. Right? And

119
00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:03.220
so that's, that's, that's thing.
Number one is back to

120
00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:06.550
the community aspect of things.
You talked about how you

121
00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:07.870
create this community, and then
they get to be a

122
00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:09.820
certain size. One of the
things that I think that

123
00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:13.000
people don't do, whether it's
a community of, to like

124
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.080
a relationship or a community
of, of a hundred or

125
00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:21.580
more is express what the
actual goals are. So I'll

126
00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:25.030
use a marriage as an
example, a longterm relationship, and

127
00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:27.790
then I'll scale it up
to a community where my

128
00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:29.560
wife and I got married,
you know, everyone gets, gets

129
00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.410
married or gets it's another
partnership. And then they, they

130
00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:35.470
write their vows and it's
surprising how few people actually

131
00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:39.010
write their mission statement. Like
I've seen more sophisticated business

132
00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:42.190
plans from people who are
opening a food cart. Then

133
00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:47.080
I have people getting married,
my wife and I wrote

134
00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:51.790
our business plan, our, our,
our goal, our like, what

135
00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:54.310
is the point of this
community? We are building this

136
00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:58.000
culture of too, that we
have made, and we are

137
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.080
doing it with an intentionality
to it. That makes sense.

138
00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:05.920
And when you put together
a community, whether it be

139
00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:09.490
50 live coders or a
blog or whatever, you set

140
00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:13.570
a tone, it's a congregation
to use a religious reference.

141
00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:17.730
And if when my podcast
is a community, my blog

142
00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:20.230
is community. My Twitter account
is a community. And you

143
00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:22.840
have to make sure that
80 to 90% of the

144
00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:25.840
people in that community, or
if it's a community of

145
00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:31.150
two, 100% of the people
are 100% behind the goals.

146
00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:34.870
Right. And when it gets
into the 50 50, as

147
00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:38.770
we see, like, if we
look at like government right

148
00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:41.130
now, all over the world,
it seems to be also

149
00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:43.540
weighting between 51% and 49%
where it's like, wait a

150
00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:45.670
second. We're not even agreeing
on like the 10 commandments

151
00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:51.160
thou shalt not kill bands.
You know, like those kinds

152
00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:56.250
of conversations indicate that we
can't even agree on the

153
00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:59.880
earth is flat or not.
Right? So when you put

154
00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.070
together the live coders, what,
what you all need to

155
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:06.090
do as a team is
decide, what's the tone? What

156
00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:08.340
is the goal? What is
the way we're going to

157
00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:11.070
interact with people so that
if a troll shows up

158
00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:14.970
or a meanie shows up
or whatever, they are overwhelmed

159
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:18.120
with the positivity of the
group and that there's not

160
00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:21.000
5%, 10%, 30% of the
people that are like, well,

161
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.460
you know, they're just, well,
actually, you know, it's good

162
00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:26.310
to ask hard questions or
whatever. You have to hit

163
00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:30.000
them hard with, Nope, this
is a positive space block

164
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.570
and move on. Right. That's
how you scale. It starts

165
00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:35.640
with two people agreeing on
what the hell we're doing,

166
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.720
and then scaling up and
making sure that the slider

167
00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:42.960
bar between the one side
of the, you know, one

168
00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:45.660
side of your perspective of
how you want your community

169
00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:48.120
to behave and act, you
know, is it a community

170
00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.610
that, that is, are a
bunch of edge Lords that

171
00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:53.880
are like pushing the edge
of, of what is appropriate?

172
00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.350
Or are they a bunch
of people who are like

173
00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:59.910
excessively kind? You know what
I'm saying? Like, I live,

174
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.960
I'm not religious, but I
happened to live coincidentally in

175
00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:08.160
a community that is 95%
Mormon. And while I'm not

176
00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.830
a Mormon, darn, there's some
nice people. Like you got

177
00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:13.680
to give him credit for
agreeing on niceness as a

178
00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:18.300
thing. They are excessively killing
with kindness. I'm like literally

179
00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:20.400
a hundred feet right now
from a stake center, a

180
00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:23.010
more, it's like a Mormon
church. And they're just like

181
00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:25.140
so nice. And it's like,
well, you know, we may

182
00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:27.390
not agree on all the
Mormon stuff, but gosh, darn

183
00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:31.650
it. We can sure. Agree
on kindness. Yeah. So that

184
00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:37.830
agreement, the, the intentionality what's
called deliberate practice go on

185
00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:41.850
Google for deliberate practice is
so fundamental to community, but,

186
00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:43.680
but no one ever actually
says it. And then that's

187
00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:45.660
why communities sometimes succeed or
they don't. That's why I

188
00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:47.580
like Reddit is such a
challenge right now is that

189
00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:52.320
no one actually founded Reddit
with the agreement that we

190
00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.840
would all be nice. And
now after the fact they're

191
00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.510
trying to re do, what's
called <inaudible>, you're trying to

192
00:10:57.510 --> 00:11:02.370
read Khan. Nice. You can't.
Retcon nice. So while you

193
00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:05.010
are a small team, figure
out what you all believe

194
00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:07.530
in, you know, like this,
I believe where's the 10

195
00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:11.220
commandments or the, the, the
bill of rights of this

196
00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:16.590
little group here. Does that
make sense? It does. That

197
00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:21.780
completely answers my question. And
I'm very impressed with your

198
00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:28.790
attitude. I I'm taking it
back. I have to sit

199
00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:35.000
for it. Well, my PayPal,
Someone, I don't even know.

200
00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:38.510
You don't know me. You
should get to know me.

201
00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:43.190
Just Google Scott. It's the
fifth entry on Google. Yeah,

202
00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:45.710
it's right after Scott toilet,
paper tissue. There you go.

203
00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:47.630
Thank you very much. I
appreciate that. I just wanted

204
00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:49.190
to answer the right question
and I sound like I

205
00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:51.950
did our case, you know,
a really great, a really

206
00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:55.420
great website, that really great
community that you're probably all

207
00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:59.920
familiar with is called code
newbies. Yes. Code nui.org. You

208
00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:03.940
know, step one, don't be
a Dick. That was what

209
00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:06.280
they did and they are
excessive. And the idea is

210
00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:10.480
that when 99% of the
people are that nice, then

211
00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:14.020
you end up with the
community self policing so that

212
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:17.200
someone does not necessarily have
to show up in order

213
00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:22.390
to be nice. Yeah. So
Ron cleanse that community. Thank

214
00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:24.610
you. And I apologize for
calling you a little Bobby,

215
00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:26.820
The tables, but let me
do that. That'll make it

216
00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:31.620
required. So we had the
second question that, that came

217
00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:35.580
through rock zombie too, as,
as a question. Yeah. I,

218
00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:38.880
I'm interested in starting a
blog. I've been streaming kind

219
00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:42.330
of inconsistently, which I realize
now is it's probably a

220
00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:45.420
big factor too, you know,
the, the lack of community

221
00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:47.730
growth. But yeah, I was
kind of interested in how

222
00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:50.400
you started your blog. Like
how much of your growth

223
00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:52.800
was attributed to your blog.
And did you already have

224
00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:55.800
a community like a Twitter
following maybe? Or did you

225
00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:57.900
already have some kind of
audience before you started it?

226
00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:00.540
And yeah, I just kinda
want to know how, how,

227
00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:03.000
how crucial of a piece
your, your blog is to

228
00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:07.110
your audience and your communities
that you built. Okay. So

229
00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:10.500
there's a couple of things
worth calling out there. First,

230
00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.690
you use the word growth.
I want to dig into

231
00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:15.780
that. Then you said Twitter,
and then you said following,

232
00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:19.710
and then the blog. So
first consistency is King period

233
00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:22.260
full stop. I tell this
to my kids and I

234
00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:23.910
don't mean to refer to
you all as kids, but

235
00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:26.130
I'm old. So I'm going
to do that. I tell

236
00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:31.440
my kids step one, show
up. Absolutely. Absolutely. Show up.

237
00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:35.040
Consistency is the thing. How
often have you visited someone

238
00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:38.880
else's blog? And the very
last blog post is a

239
00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:42.030
rededication of themselves to blogging.
I haven't been blogging lately

240
00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:45.210
when I'm back. And it's
like four years ago. Right?

241
00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:47.220
It's like the last thing
that they ever wrote was

242
00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:49.980
like, I'm back and I'm
ready to blog that's because

243
00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:52.770
people set up these failure
systems, they set up failure

244
00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:57.990
systems for themselves. And if
you can blog once a

245
00:13:57.990 --> 00:14:01.440
month or once a week,
or what a once is

246
00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:05.040
something it's gotta be something
that you can't ever stop.

247
00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:07.770
It's gotta be far enough
away that you miss it

248
00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:10.710
when it doesn't happen. It
can't be too far away.

249
00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:14.670
That coming back as a
chore, right. It's gotta be

250
00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:18.300
well spaced out in everyone's.
Spacing is different for some

251
00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:21.840
people blogging every day is
like a diary for some

252
00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:23.730
people it's like, Oh God,
it's Friday. I got a

253
00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:27.270
blog. Yeah, Scott, it was,
it was a discussion with

254
00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:29.940
you around this type of
topic that really got me

255
00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:36.150
focused on streaming consistently. Yup.
Yup. You gotta be consistent,

256
00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:38.490
but you also need to
make sure that you have

257
00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:40.290
to check with yourself. You
have to have an internal

258
00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:44.460
check-in where you say, does
this feed my spirit? Like,

259
00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:47.220
is this the thing that
makes me happy? If you

260
00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:50.970
feel you need a blog
to grow, then that's the

261
00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:54.980
attitude. And the thing is,
there's always going to be

262
00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:57.170
somewhere. You can throw your
time and there's always going

263
00:14:57.170 --> 00:15:00.740
to be somewhere. You can
throw your keystrokes, blogs, podcasts,

264
00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:05.750
wikis, stack overflow, internal QA
systems. Like all these places

265
00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:07.760
are that you can do.
You can put your keystrokes,

266
00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:10.850
but as rambling geek just
said, do it because you

267
00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:13.070
enjoy it. Not because you
feel that it's a requirement

268
00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:16.400
now that said, you still
need to work out, right?

269
00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:19.640
Exercise is required. Otherwise you'll,
you know, well, it's not

270
00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:21.860
really required. I mean, you'll
die earlier if you don't,

271
00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:23.810
but you do it because
it's the right thing to

272
00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:26.990
do exercising every day, twice
a day might burn you

273
00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:29.300
out. Right? But it's all
comes down to the serotonin

274
00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:32.570
balance. But here are also
very good things from my

275
00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:35.420
rhyme. You hear enjoyment, money
or habit. If you go

276
00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:39.020
out and Google for Hanselman
productivity tips. One of the

277
00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:41.630
things that I talk about
in my complete list of

278
00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:46.760
productivity tips is if something
is not set up to

279
00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:49.430
let me start and find
the, here we go, Christopher

280
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:52.490
Hawkings said this quote, I'm
going to paste this quote

281
00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:55.730
right here. Now I'm going
to change that quote because

282
00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:58.910
the part where he says
make money is BS. And

283
00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:01.640
I'm going to just put
underscore. If it's not helping

284
00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:04.880
me to blank, it's not
helping me to improve my

285
00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:06.590
life in some way. It
is mental clutter and it's

286
00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:08.870
out. So take all the
things that you do in

287
00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:14.810
your life. Everything short them
signal versus noise value versus

288
00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:18.110
no value where value is
up to you. The reason

289
00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:20.690
that I changed the part
where he said make money

290
00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:23.690
and change it into underscores
was to make the observation

291
00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:26.630
that what is your goal
is your goal. Fix your

292
00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:28.460
career is your goal. To
spend more time with your

293
00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:31.880
family is your goal to
get a six pack, whatever

294
00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:34.340
every single thing in your
life needs to be measured

295
00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:38.570
against that goal. You see?
So if, if a goal

296
00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:40.490
is, you know, have a
great career and make more

297
00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:43.970
money, but what's the real
goal under that goal. Does

298
00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:47.930
that make sense for me?
I started the blog, not

299
00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:50.210
for you. I've been blogging
all these years and I

300
00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:52.430
did it for myself. I
did it so I can

301
00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:56.750
Google myself later. I gave
a talk yesterday@theportlandarea.net users group.

302
00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:59.420
And I probably Googled for
myself by just adding my

303
00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:02.690
last name. Plus the thing
I was searching for seven

304
00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:07.400
times maybe nine, which means
that every single time, something

305
00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:11.390
interesting happened rather than forgetting
about it, rather than emailing

306
00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:14.960
someone. I wrote a blog
post about it, do that

307
00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:18.260
once a week for a
year that's 50 blog posts

308
00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:21.800
do that once a week
for 10 years, that's 500

309
00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:25.640
blog posts. So it's not
hard like consistency. It's just

310
00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:29.990
like compounded interest, right? I've
got thousands of blog posts,

311
00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:31.730
but you've got to do
it once a week, but

312
00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:33.710
once a month that won't
make a lot of blocks.

313
00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:37.280
You, you can't help, but
help your career if you

314
00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:40.610
blog once a week and
all of the excuses about

315
00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:42.350
reasons not to blog. Well,
I don't have anything to

316
00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:44.630
say. There's so many servers
already been said, ignore the

317
00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:47.540
haters. Just it's a diary.
Do it online, do it

318
00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:51.750
consistently. It will make life
better. Thank you. That was

319
00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:56.550
like super, super informative. And
I guess just a small

320
00:17:56.550 --> 00:18:00.180
follow up question then is
since my issue with bogging

321
00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:02.040
has, well, I haven't even
started it, but I guess

322
00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:06.090
the reason why is I
have had a hard time

323
00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:08.520
trying to find like a
good workflow. So maybe if

324
00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:10.710
you could share a bit
of insight into your workflow

325
00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:14.370
as to what your blogging
process looks like. So first

326
00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:16.170
thing I have a blog
post, I'm going to go

327
00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:18.300
and bring it up. It's
called a, your words are

328
00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:24.060
wasted. Words are wasted while
you're grabbing that. I'm also

329
00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:26.340
going to unmute Michael jolly
because that feeds kind of

330
00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:30.150
into his question, which I
have next year. So Roxanne,

331
00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:31.410
and I'm going to put
you on mute and I'm

332
00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:34.230
going to unmute Michael jolly
so he can continue a

333
00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:39.750
little bit of that conversation.
So my workflow is I

334
00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:43.500
use a tool called windows
live writer that is just

335
00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:45.690
basically electric paper. You know,
I mean, it's just like

336
00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:48.240
Mark down. It's just a
nice little HTML editor that

337
00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:50.820
I can hit post on
the point is you don't

338
00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:53.820
want to have anything in
the blogging process. Be tedious.

339
00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:54.990
You just wanna be able
to open a thing up

340
00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:58.050
and start slapping the keyboard.
So like, I'll give you

341
00:18:58.050 --> 00:19:00.000
an example of like a
free blog post that I

342
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.960
did for myself. Here you
go. Thursday, last week, a

343
00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:07.290
young lady on Twitter texted
me and said, Hey, I'm

344
00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:10.890
finishing my PhD. And I'm
super nervous about like becoming

345
00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:13.950
an adult. Do you have
any advice? And I just

346
00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:15.780
started slapping on the keyboard
and I gave her a

347
00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:18.480
list of advice and she
tweeted it for you actually

348
00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:21.240
tweeted screenshots of our DM.
And it ended up going

349
00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:23.580
kind of like low key
viral. And then I'm like,

350
00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:26.460
wow, I just slapped the
keyboard, like 2000 keystrokes there.

351
00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:28.380
I'm going to turn that
into a blog post. So

352
00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:30.180
then I copy pasted the
words in your blog post.

353
00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:34.950
You see what I'm saying?
Like don't waste your keystrokes.

354
00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:39.860
Thanks to Datadog for sponsoring

368
00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:41.000
Scott, for hanging out with
us today, all the content

369
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.640
you're putting together, whether it
be blog posts, the podcasts

370
00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:47.620
to do a tweets, all
that kind of it's a

371
00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:50.050
lot of content to put
out there, right? So I'm

372
00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:52.600
kind of curious, how do
you manage all that? Like

373
00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:54.430
if you're putting out a
blog post every, you know,

374
00:20:54.430 --> 00:21:01.930
say two weeks ups, twice
a week, podcasts coming out

375
00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:04.630
regularly, do you like cue
that up? And you say,

376
00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:07.690
you know, this weekend I'm
going to write up four

377
00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:10.330
or five blog posts and
just had them queue for

378
00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:13.930
the month or do you
attack that? That's a good

379
00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:17.280
question. That's a good question.
So I use the, to

380
00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:19.200
do app, the Microsoft to
do app. It used to

381
00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:23.670
be called Wunderlist and the
trick with, with anything like

382
00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:25.650
this is, remember that it's
kind of like a buffer

383
00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:28.740
and buffers that are like
supposed to be like a

384
00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:31.080
bucket or like a, a
backlog for lack of a

385
00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:34.290
better word, right? If a
buffer overflows, right? The backlog

386
00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:37.560
became too big. If I
gave you four ideas of

387
00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:39.570
things that you could write
a blog post about, you'd

388
00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:41.250
be like, Oh cool, I've
got a nice little backlog,

389
00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:43.260
like four things I can
write about. But if I

390
00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:45.210
gave you a backlog of
a hundred things, you'd be

391
00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:47.250
like, ah, I'm never going
to catch up. I'll never

392
00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:49.500
be able to write those
blog posts. So I have

393
00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:52.230
in my to do app
a, a list called blog

394
00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:57.330
post and there's 18 potential
blog posts. Now these are

395
00:21:57.390 --> 00:21:59.880
18 potential things I could
write about. And that's a

396
00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:02.430
number that's big in that
I'll never run out of

397
00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:05.820
stuff to blog about, but
it's not overwhelming where it's

398
00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:08.220
like, ah, the pressure of
the psychic weight of this

399
00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:12.900
is too much. So I
have a, a less, a,

400
00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:17.970
a backlog of existing written
posts and more a backlog

401
00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:19.710
of ideas that are just
so good that they'll just

402
00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:22.610
write themselves. Does that make
sense? So like, I, like

403
00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:25.080
it says blog, colon, and
then I've got the little

404
00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:26.700
subject I want to write.
It's like, Oh, I could

405
00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:29.970
write that in an hour.
So it's just enough information

406
00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:31.450
that would allow me to
write a blog post very

407
00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:34.050
quickly. And then I have
a S a Q that

408
00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:36.450
is of a good size
that is encouraging, but not

409
00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:41.100
a crushingly large queue. Yeah.
So I'm doing like, literally,

410
00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:43.170
like the same thing I'm
using Microsoft to do. I've

411
00:22:43.170 --> 00:22:47.070
got like a redo list
of, of blog posts, but

412
00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:51.210
then you've also got like
your, your podcasts and even

413
00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:52.800
tweaks. Like one of the
things I've gotten is like,

414
00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:57.000
I've got named like social
media calendar where like, it's,

415
00:22:57.450 --> 00:22:59.160
Hey, I need to put
this out. You know what,

416
00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:02.880
the blog post, I need
to go find something someone

417
00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:04.830
else has done on dev
two or something like that.

418
00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:07.320
And just, you know, kind
of elevate them, tweet them

419
00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:10.140
out, try to give them
some exposure. Sure. It sounds

420
00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:12.000
like you're putting a lot
more thought into Twitter than

421
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.790
I am. So are you
like, like with your podcasts

422
00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:17.760
or are you ever like
trying to combine some of

423
00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:19.350
that and saying, you know,
Hey, I want to, I

424
00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:23.460
want to do a blog
post on like your posts

425
00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:26.670
you do with the Kubernetes
cluster. Do you ever think,

426
00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:28.890
you know what, that's such
a great project. I'm going

427
00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:31.920
to do a blog post
about that and bring somebody

428
00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:34.050
on and do a blog,
a podcast about that as

429
00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:36.660
well, right? Yeah. So if
there's a thing that has

430
00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:39.060
me excited, like for example,
a couple of weeks ago,

431
00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:42.450
I was excited about a
thing called Pico eight a

432
00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:45.350
to game writing system. So
it's like, okay. The, and

433
00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:47.210
I are doing Pico eight
on the weekends playing around.

434
00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:49.640
Therefore I'll do a couple
of blog posts on Pico

435
00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:52.100
eight. Therefore I'll reach out
to the person who invented

436
00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:54.710
Pico eight and have them
on my show. And then

437
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:57.770
I found another second person
that did stuff on PicoWay.

438
00:23:57.830 --> 00:24:00.980
So over the course of
nothing other than I was

439
00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:04.460
interested in a topic, I
got two blog posts to

440
00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:07.070
podcasts and a project with
the kids out of it.

441
00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:12.840
This was something I learned
early on Scott from Yeah.

442
00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:15.070
Friend of both of ours.
Chris sells when I worked

443
00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:20.320
for him, the idea of
don't waste content. If you're

444
00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:23.620
going to write some content,
if you're going to be,

445
00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:26.230
do a podcast or something,
figure out a way that

446
00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:28.990
you can reuse it at
least two or three times,

447
00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:31.840
maybe, maybe a blog post
turns into a talk that

448
00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:34.900
you give at a conference.
Yeah. The myth, the myth

449
00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:39.460
that I'm somehow productive is
a perception management issue. That

450
00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:43.570
is only me not wasting
content. So I've done whole

451
00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:48.250
talks on don't waste your
keystrokes and the idea being

452
00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:51.640
that, like, let's say that
after this call, one of

453
00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:54.910
you lovely people who I
do not know, emails me

454
00:24:55.150 --> 00:24:59.290
a great question. I don't
know you you're lovely people,

455
00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:01.990
but I'm not going to
give you 5,000 of my

456
00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:04.750
keystrokes. Right. I'm like, cause
you're just going to reply

457
00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:08.080
and be like, thanks. And
like, okay, well I just

458
00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:09.850
gave that person all these
keystrokes. And then what was

459
00:25:09.850 --> 00:25:12.460
the point? Instead, I will
put those keystrokes in a

460
00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:14.860
blog post and do a
YouTube video and do a

461
00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:16.660
Twitch stream on it or
whatever. I, you know, do

462
00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:20.080
a podcast. So what you've
done by emailing me an

463
00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:23.650
unsolicited question is in fact,
give me a gift, which

464
00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:26.410
is wow. What a cool
question. I never thought about

465
00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:29.770
that. A, any question from
the audience is a gift.

466
00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:32.890
And once they've given you
that gift, then you can

467
00:25:32.890 --> 00:25:36.760
put it in, in a
number of places, wherein is

468
00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:40.830
some number one, plus blog,
post podcast, which stream blah,

469
00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:43.720
blah, blah, YouTube on and
on, on and on. Now,

470
00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:47.620
before it never emailed them
back, we send them a

471
00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:50.450
link to the thing that
you did. Absolutely. And, and

472
00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:52.300
that kind of feeds into
a little bit of the

473
00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:54.580
next question I have Kim
Phillpotts has a question. I'm

474
00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:56.500
going to come to that
in a second, but I

475
00:25:56.500 --> 00:26:00.850
wanted to kind of feed
in and conclude your thought

476
00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:03.560
there about someone asking a
question as a gift for,

477
00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:06.700
for us as streamers, when
we get those questions in

478
00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:09.490
chat that, you know, somebody
who's asking the question, Oh,

479
00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:12.070
how do I do this
in C-sharp or, Hey, there's

480
00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:14.410
a Java script library here.
I'm having a problem with

481
00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:19.570
those absolutely are gifts for
us as streamers to be

482
00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:22.140
able to generate a clip,
to be able to, to

483
00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:25.630
think here's, here's a topic
for my next stream that

484
00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:30.520
we can go after, right?
Oh yeah. Every, every time

485
00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:32.230
that happens, that's an example
of what you can do

486
00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:35.830
that. But the flip side
of that, and this is

487
00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:37.360
the question that I have
for you. And I really,

488
00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:40.360
I think a couple of
folks had had similar concepts

489
00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:42.250
around this that they wanted
to hear your opinion on

490
00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:45.960
is how do you handle
the heaters who come in

491
00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:49.050
with that, that trolley question,
send you a tweet. That's

492
00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:50.610
mean, how do you, what
do you do with it?

493
00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.330
That's a tough one because
there's a couple of things

494
00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:55.430
here. Like it's easy. I'll
tell you what I do.

495
00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:59.090
And I'll tell you that
it is, you know, that

496
00:26:59.090 --> 00:27:03.380
it's true, but it always
stings. Right? And, and there

497
00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:05.210
are varying levels of privilege
that you can come at

498
00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:07.820
this with where I've got,
you know, I'm, I'm old

499
00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:11.060
and I'm doing okay. So
there's very little that you

500
00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:13.070
can do to hurt my
feelings. You know what I

501
00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:16.040
mean? Well, if I was,
you know, a 24 year

502
00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:19.670
old woman who didn't speak
English, well, you know, like

503
00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:22.010
add on to all the
different things that would make

504
00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:26.660
me not privilege would it
would become plus one plus

505
00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:28.820
two plus three more difficult
to just shake it off.

506
00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:35.390
Right. But if the, the,
the, the philosophical answer to

507
00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:38.840
that question is why would
I let someone who doesn't

508
00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:42.890
love me ruin my day?
Why would I allow them

509
00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:46.250
to do that? There are
8 billion people in the world,

510
00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:47.810
and you do not need
to be friends with them.

511
00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:51.530
All right, absolutely. So why
would I allow them to

512
00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:54.230
read, why would I allow
an internet stranger to reach

513
00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:57.020
out from nowhere? It's almost
like, you know, you only

514
00:27:57.020 --> 00:27:59.270
want people to text you
if they know you, but

515
00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:02.480
we allow anyone in the
world to tweet us, someone

516
00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:06.890
I tweeted about the Peloton
thing recently, and the Peloton

517
00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:09.350
commercial, a stupid commercial that
happened. I had some stupid

518
00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:11.360
tweet about it and it's
gone viral. And it's like

519
00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:14.540
5,000 people. And people are
telling me that, like, they're

520
00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:17.480
just calling me horrible names.
And they're saying, my family

521
00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:20.090
sucks and I must be
a week. This and that.

522
00:28:20.090 --> 00:28:22.070
And all these dirty words,
I can't even say. And

523
00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:24.800
I'm thinking to myself, y'all
are using social media to

524
00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:28.100
reach out into the world
and crap on me because

525
00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:32.360
of a $2,500 stationary bicycle.
Like, why do you feel

526
00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:34.400
so strongly about it? So
I just muted the entire

527
00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:39.260
thread. Does that make sense?
Absolutely. So didn't block them

528
00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:43.610
because blocking is aggressive, but
I do mute very consistently.

529
00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:47.960
It's something that we as
streamers need to be able

530
00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:51.230
to handle in our chat
rooms, because it right. There

531
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:54.320
are times when, when the
stream will turn, will turn

532
00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:57.200
negative. You'll have trolls that
pop up and try and

533
00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:00.290
take over. Yep. Well, so
then that gets back to

534
00:29:00.290 --> 00:29:04.400
the original conversation about how
positive can you make your

535
00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:06.620
room? One of the people
that I always loved was

536
00:29:06.770 --> 00:29:12.410
a no op cat, right?
Like such positivity in her

537
00:29:12.410 --> 00:29:14.840
stream that when the negative
people showed up, they would

538
00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:18.680
drown out the others. So
you've got to stack the

539
00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:23.900
deck and let them go
after the bad people Here

540
00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:26.090
today. But she's, she's a
member of this discord as

541
00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:29.050
well. Yeah. So, you know
what I'm saying? Like, she,

542
00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:34.160
she, her kindness was infectious.
Therefore it would prevent, you

543
00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:40.280
know, she, she had advocates
working on her behalf. Absolutely.

544
00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:45.870
So that Kind of To
Kim's question about hosting them,

545
00:29:45.930 --> 00:29:48.270
right. Hosting is a little
bit more than just managing

546
00:29:48.270 --> 00:29:51.270
what's going on. Let me
unmute Kim. So he can

547
00:29:51.270 --> 00:29:54.630
ask his question. So Scott,
you, you create a lot

548
00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:58.080
of really awesome content where
you're interviewing people and including

549
00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:01.410
people like all your channel
nine stuff and bringing others

550
00:30:01.410 --> 00:30:03.360
into our communities and channels,
it seems like a very

551
00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:06.780
natural way to keep growing
and producing content. So my

552
00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:09.660
question really is, do you
have any tips or resources

553
00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:12.660
for improving interviewing techniques? Like,
is there a, is there

554
00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:14.610
a school for that or
is it just practice and

555
00:30:14.610 --> 00:30:23.160
experience? I believe that interviewing
techniques are similar to improv.

556
00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:27.360
There's a thing called comedy
sports with a Zed at

557
00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:31.110
the end. There's usually one
anywhere near you. It's literally

558
00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:33.780
learning how to do improv.
And one of the biggest

559
00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:36.750
things about improv is what's
called yes. And where you

560
00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:39.660
don't say no to somebody,
you and stay say yes

561
00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:42.360
and no is a hard,
a hard stop. And then

562
00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:45.990
you have to turn around
and redirect. So you've literally

563
00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:49.290
slammed someone up against a
topic and then rotated them

564
00:30:49.290 --> 00:30:51.990
and then shoved them in
another direction that requires energy.

565
00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:54.990
And it takes energy out
of the conversation. If someone

566
00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:57.060
is doing improv and you're
trying to make something up

567
00:30:57.060 --> 00:30:59.910
and you're like, okay, you
know, I've got a Ninja

568
00:30:59.910 --> 00:31:03.360
sword and you're a Toronto
source. And someone's like, no,

569
00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:06.180
I'm not. I'm like, well,
wow, okay. You just like

570
00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:08.880
crapped on the whole premise.
They're like, what? Okay. If

571
00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:10.050
I'm not trying to start
with what are, you know,

572
00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:14.070
as opposed to yes. And,
and then redirect, you know

573
00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:15.360
what I mean? It's the
same thing. Like you say

574
00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:18.390
no to a little kid
and it just messes, messes

575
00:31:18.390 --> 00:31:20.070
them up and then you
have to go and redirect.

576
00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:22.790
Yes. And here we go,
as chef Brent says, building

577
00:31:22.790 --> 00:31:24.960
on what they said, instead
of shutting it down. Even

578
00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:26.790
if you mean, no, you
can say yes and, and

579
00:31:26.790 --> 00:31:28.740
then redirect the conversation and
they won't even feel it.

580
00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:33.660
Yes. And is the Bruce Lee
maneuver extend what? They said?

581
00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:36.150
It, you may not be
a perfect 100%. Yes. But

582
00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:39.120
it's not a slap in
the face. No, that is

583
00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:42.570
a thing. Additionally, there's a
show called fresh air with

584
00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:47.400
Terry Gross. That's an American show
on national public radio. She

585
00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:50.820
is well considered one of
the top interviewers of all

586
00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:54.690
time and watching, like listening
to her, not for the

587
00:31:54.690 --> 00:31:58.230
content, but rather for the
style at which she moved,

588
00:31:58.230 --> 00:32:00.510
the conversation forward is worth
it. I would listen to

589
00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:02.760
her earlier stuff. Now that
she's been doing this for

590
00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:05.370
40 years, she's getting a
little bit lazy, but the

591
00:32:05.370 --> 00:32:07.170
way that she did it
in the mid nineties, the

592
00:32:07.170 --> 00:32:10.650
classic Cary gross R M
interview styles are a way

593
00:32:10.650 --> 00:32:13.230
of listening to an interview.
As, as if you are

594
00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:17.460
watching a black belt and
studying their style, you can

595
00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:18.930
get caught up in the
content, but you need to

596
00:32:18.930 --> 00:32:21.390
basically turn your, turn your
content brain off and say,

597
00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:23.940
Oh, look how she did
that. Look how she redirected

598
00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:28.320
that look how she took
that potentially awkward moment and

599
00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:31.230
turned it around and turn
it into something special VR.

600
00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:33.120
Again, this gets back to
the original part of the

601
00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:37.230
conversation, deliberate practice. Like people
seem to think that you

602
00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:39.620
can just turn on the
mic and start interviewing and

603
00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:43.700
it's going to go, well,
you cannot, you have to

604
00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:45.620
think about it. And it's
like, well, I'm a smart

605
00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:47.750
person. Why shouldn't I be
able to hold a conversation

606
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:50.900
for 30 minutes and not
sound like an idiot? Well,

607
00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:53.540
have you practiced it? Like,
have you, have you thought

608
00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:56.810
about it as a deliberate
focused practice? Have you analyzed,

609
00:32:56.810 --> 00:32:59.780
have you listened to yourself
and said, Oh shoot, I

610
00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:02.120
didn't answer that. Right. I
should have, I should have

611
00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:05.480
taken the conversation in this
way. We, when, so when

612
00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:07.250
we look back in time
and we say, Oh God,

613
00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:09.440
I only said that it
would have gone in another

614
00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:13.820
way. We are conditioned to
consciously not criticize ourselves in

615
00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:16.940
that way. And I would
propose that you take a

616
00:33:17.030 --> 00:33:21.440
unflinching. I turned around, look
back, listen to watch yourself

617
00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:24.800
on video and say, wow,
I did this wrong. I

618
00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:27.230
shouldn't have done it that
way. And I will try

619
00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:29.780
it differently. The next way
people think that just being

620
00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:33.350
human and having a conversation
is natural. Being charming is

621
00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:36.170
in fact, a real, a
real art. It is a

622
00:33:36.170 --> 00:33:38.870
thing that you can practice
and become better at just

623
00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:42.740
like dancing. Does that make
sense? It makes total sense.

624
00:33:42.770 --> 00:33:45.220
What do you think Kim
does it though? Does it

625
00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:51.650
deference? Great advice. Thanks. Oh,
thank you for the question.

626
00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:54.560
It was a gift. See
how I did that, yo.

627
00:33:56.350 --> 00:34:00.860
Oh my gosh. Now where's
Callow. When you brought up

628
00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:03.980
imposter syndrome earlier, that was
something new that he, that

629
00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:06.560
he hadn't heard before. Kelo,
I'm going to unmute you

630
00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:08.600
so you can, you can
follow up on the topic

631
00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:11.810
of imposter syndrome with Scott
here. One of the things

632
00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:14.600
I want to remind you
of, please, I'm pretty sure

633
00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:19.490
this is the thing. Yes,
this is pretty good, but

634
00:34:19.490 --> 00:34:22.730
there's a, there's a YouTube
channel called charisma on command.

635
00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:27.800
Most of these are very
kind of broke fish where

636
00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:30.110
they're like teaching men, how
to not, you know, how

637
00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:32.000
to talk to women or
whatever. This is actually a

638
00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.500
useful focused analysis of how
to behave a certain way.

639
00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:40.640
And now don't let the
weirdo like icons turn you

640
00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:43.640
off, but it's like, why
do we find Jimmy Fallon

641
00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:46.730
fake? And why do we
find canner Reeves to be

642
00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:50.060
charming? Like, he'll literally look
at an interview and he'll

643
00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:51.740
say like, look at the
one with Rupert, what's his

644
00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:54.980
name? There? There's there's specific
techniques and how he moves

645
00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:57.560
his body, how he uses
his eyes, that change how

646
00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:00.710
people respond to him. And
it is, it is really

647
00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:03.800
special and worth watching. Oh,
very cool. I'll have to

648
00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:06.560
check that out. Yeah. Sincerely.
Okay. People are agreeing. So

649
00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:09.140
that makes me feel good.
Yeah. Let me unmute Callow

650
00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:12.230
so we can follow up
on the discussion about imposter

651
00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:14.980
syndrome earlier. There you go.
Callow, you're open. Yeah. Just

652
00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:19.960
the terminology processing of it
struck me because I didn't

653
00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:24.130
feel, you know, yeah. You
don't know enough to answer

654
00:35:24.130 --> 00:35:28.840
this question properly or, you
know, but other people seem

655
00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:33.850
to know, you know, enough
to answer the question and

656
00:35:33.910 --> 00:35:36.760
that happens throughout life, not
just programming and things like

657
00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:41.220
that. Without me having to
read all the content that

658
00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:49.190
you posted, I will. Yeah.
Yeah. Oh, geez. No, I

659
00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:51.650
see. You still struggle with
it from all the comments

660
00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:55.400
you make, from what we,
what we say at the

661
00:35:55.400 --> 00:36:00.230
end of the day, how
do you make yourself feel

662
00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:05.060
like, you know what you
know? So if we go

663
00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:09.800
back to the idea of
deliberate practice, let's just be

664
00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:12.740
real. Cause we have like
a small group here. And

665
00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:15.680
even though we're recording, which
makes me nervous, I can

666
00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:18.230
keep it 100 with just
like 50 of my new

667
00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:23.270
close friends here. We can
understand that most people live

668
00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:28.250
their lives, accepting the defaults.
Most people just double click

669
00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:31.670
on the installer. They go
next, next, next finish. And

670
00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:35.420
that's it. But if you
were deliberate about installing some

671
00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:37.970
shit, you will hit custom
and you will read the

672
00:36:37.970 --> 00:36:41.510
ULA and you will think
about it. We don't live

673
00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:44.000
our lives deliberately every day.
You don't wake up on

674
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.400
every random Tuesday and like,
think about what am I

675
00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:48.470
going to do today to
make my day better? What

676
00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:50.120
am I going? How can
I be my best self?

677
00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:52.700
Some people have the energy,
some people don't. But what

678
00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:54.440
you can do is you
can acknowledge and you can

679
00:36:54.440 --> 00:37:01.040
say, you know, I sleep
walked through last week or

680
00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:03.590
I got 20 years experience.
But for three of those

681
00:37:03.590 --> 00:37:07.820
years, I was just coasting
being like honest with yourself

682
00:37:07.850 --> 00:37:10.340
and then saying, I'm going
to wake up tomorrow. And

683
00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:11.600
this is what I'm gonna
do to hold it down.

684
00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:13.940
And I'm going to handle
these, these three things tomorrow

685
00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:19.580
to make life better. Simply
the, the observation of your

686
00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:22.610
own behaviors, changes things. You
know how they always say,

687
00:37:22.610 --> 00:37:25.190
if you observe it, you
modify it. Like you can't

688
00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:28.460
look at something without changing
it by simply looking you

689
00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:31.970
can't by simply being mindful.
Thank you. Right? I move

690
00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:36.710
you. You cannot stop, but
improving. You cannot stop. If

691
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:39.470
you think about like, I'm
doing TaeKwonDo right now. And

692
00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:41.120
I got to go to
TaeKwonDo in two hours and

693
00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:42.830
I got to do some
tests for my next belt

694
00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:45.860
and mindfulness, where are my
feet right now? How is

695
00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:48.110
my body moving? Why does
my shoulder hurt? All of

696
00:37:48.110 --> 00:37:52.550
those things involve looking at
yourself unapologetically now to the

697
00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:57.140
point of imposter syndrome, I
called Jeff what three times

698
00:37:57.140 --> 00:37:58.760
this week kind of like,
Oh, I don't really know

699
00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:01.850
about this, this live coders
thing. What can I say

700
00:38:01.850 --> 00:38:04.760
to them? I don't really
think I have anything valuable

701
00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:06.290
to say. And he's like,
no, it'll be fine. I'll

702
00:38:06.290 --> 00:38:08.060
give you a list of
stuff. Talk about it. It'll

703
00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:10.460
be all right. In the
first five minutes, I was

704
00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:12.560
like, Oh my God, this
sucks. And now I think

705
00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:15.620
it's actually going pretty well.
So I need to own

706
00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:17.870
that. I need to own
that. Right. I need to

707
00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:20.000
feel about that and be
like, okay, all right, I'm

708
00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.640
still going to freak out
for the next one, but

709
00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:26.900
I'll just freak out less.
Right? I've been speaking and

710
00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:29.210
speaking, I've been on stage
of the musical theater. I've

711
00:38:29.210 --> 00:38:33.650
done standup comedy. I've been
presenting professionally for 25 years.

712
00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:36.430
I'm still nervous. The first
five minutes of every single

713
00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:38.230
one. And the goal is
to get that five minutes

714
00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:40.180
to four minutes and that
four minutes to three minutes,

715
00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:42.790
you know what I mean?
So yes. I feel like

716
00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:44.770
an imposter. Yes. I feel
like I've been coasting on

717
00:38:44.770 --> 00:38:48.010
charm for 30 years. Yes.
There are a thousand little

718
00:38:48.010 --> 00:38:50.560
things where someone can make
me question who I am

719
00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:53.620
and if I'm good, but
then I can go back

720
00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:55.360
and look at what I
do and what I have

721
00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:58.120
made and say, man, I
did that. Like, I'm gonna

722
00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:00.280
give myself credit for doing
that. I did that. I

723
00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:04.150
teach, well, I made, I
made products, you know, not,

724
00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:07.690
not everybody can stack overflow
themselves into writing an app,

725
00:39:09.010 --> 00:39:11.980
you know? So give yourself
credit, feel bad, observe it,

726
00:39:12.610 --> 00:39:15.820
then go back and say,
all right, I did do

727
00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:18.010
that. I'm going to give
myself credit for that. Does

728
00:39:18.010 --> 00:39:20.380
that make sense? You'll never
get over it. You'll just

729
00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:22.650
get over it. Okay. All
right. You say, I always

730
00:39:22.650 --> 00:39:25.230
thought there was a, there
was a point where it

731
00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:31.710
ends, well, It doesn't, it
doesn't end. I still like,

732
00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:33.570
I mean, here's the thing,
right? Like this morning I

733
00:39:33.570 --> 00:39:35.490
looked in the mirror and
I was like, surprised I'm

734
00:39:35.490 --> 00:39:39.360
not 25. And I was
just like, Oh shit, I'm

735
00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:42.390
not 25. But then I
was like, okay, well I

736
00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:44.250
guess not. I think this
is, this is things that

737
00:39:44.250 --> 00:39:46.200
are good about being old.
And these are things that

738
00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:48.720
aren't, and I'll probably wake
up tomorrow and I'll be

739
00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:53.370
surprised again, I'm not 25,
but it's that mindfulness that

740
00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:55.410
that's me get out of
that moment for a second.

741
00:39:55.410 --> 00:39:57.420
So like when I give
a talk or I give

742
00:39:57.420 --> 00:39:59.220
a podcast or I talk
to someone, like one of

743
00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:00.780
the things that I know
about myself, one of my

744
00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:04.260
internal biases is I'm intimidated
by people with a PhD.

745
00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:07.350
So whenever I meet somebody,
especially young people and I'm

746
00:40:07.350 --> 00:40:09.060
like, they're like 24 and
they got a PhD in

747
00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:12.960
whatever. And I went to
Portland community college, right? So

748
00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:15.300
like, I have like deep,
I don't know what I'm

749
00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:18.500
talking about because I'm like,
I went to, I literally

750
00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:21.750
have an associates degree in
community college and I'm like,

751
00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:24.750
Oh crap, this person is
22. I have to really

752
00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:26.940
explore that. Like, why do
I feel like an imposter

753
00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:29.420
talking to this child that
I have more experienced than

754
00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:32.130
this person has years. My
shoes are older than this

755
00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:36.030
doctor, but I'm still intimidated.
And the reason is, is

756
00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:38.610
because of the road not
taken, this person did something

757
00:40:38.610 --> 00:40:41.880
I did not do. And
I'm intimidated because they stuck

758
00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:44.640
with it. They stuck with
college. And I didn't, I

759
00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:46.890
look at that. I accept
it. I acknowledge it. And

760
00:40:46.890 --> 00:40:50.610
then I move on. Does
that make sense? Yes, it

761
00:40:50.610 --> 00:40:54.270
does. Doesn't thanks for all
the other answers to all

762
00:40:54.270 --> 00:40:57.480
the other questions. Every single
one of them made a

763
00:40:57.480 --> 00:41:02.190
difference. The answer questions I
had. Alright. Yeah. Mindfulness, deliberate

764
00:41:02.190 --> 00:41:06.990
practice, intentionality accepting that it
don't mill feel bad. Like

765
00:41:06.990 --> 00:41:09.970
the idea that it won't
get better. It's like, like

766
00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:13.650
I have diabetes, I have
type one diabetes and it's

767
00:41:13.650 --> 00:41:16.470
not cancer, but it, but
it ain't awesome. You know

768
00:41:16.470 --> 00:41:18.420
what I mean? Like I'm
going to die from it.

769
00:41:19.050 --> 00:41:22.530
So there are days, which
is like, Oh man, right?

770
00:41:22.530 --> 00:41:26.310
Like this is not, this
is not cool at all.

771
00:41:27.210 --> 00:41:28.410
And then I have to
be like, all right, this

772
00:41:28.410 --> 00:41:29.940
is a bad day. This
is a day where I'm

773
00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:31.680
having a little pity party.
I'm gonna feel bad about

774
00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:34.430
myself. And then it's like,
okay, but here's all the

775
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:37.610
list of good stuff about
being me. And I'm still

776
00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:40.670
here and it hasn't broken
me yet. So tomorrow is

777
00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:44.650
another day to turn it
all around. Cool. All right.

778
00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:48.860
Thanks. I'll be listening. Cool.
You have only 700 episodes

779
00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:54.170
of my podcast to catch
up on like, alright, thanks.

780
00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:58.310
So actually I'm cuing up
our friend or mutual friend,

781
00:41:58.310 --> 00:42:02.390
Richard Campbell to join the team
here in maybe another week

782
00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:06.200
or two, since he's got
how many years experience producing

783
00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:10.490
podcasts and hosting. Lily actually
has a question here. She's

784
00:42:10.490 --> 00:42:13.630
already un-muted I'll let her
ask her questions. Yeah. Hi.

785
00:42:13.690 --> 00:42:16.060
So my question was more
about, you know, following you

786
00:42:16.060 --> 00:42:19.900
for the last few years,
not literally figuratively, you're always

787
00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:22.630
on the road, you have
all kinds of arrangements. And

788
00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:26.140
my question, my question is
how do you keep in

789
00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:28.510
touch with not only your
community, but also the care

790
00:42:28.510 --> 00:42:30.940
people in your life? Because
you know, your, your family,

791
00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:34.300
your, your spouse, your kids,
extended family, friends, coworkers, they

792
00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:36.910
all have requirements of you.
So how do you, how

793
00:42:36.910 --> 00:42:39.130
do you meet those requirements?
How to continue, how are

794
00:42:39.130 --> 00:42:43.090
you able to continually meet
those requirements? When I talk

795
00:42:43.090 --> 00:42:46.210
about mindfulness and intentionality, it's
something that is not like

796
00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:48.040
a, you wake up in
the morning and you look

797
00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:50.140
at the post it note
on the, on the mirror

798
00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:52.390
and you go, this is
a day I'm going to

799
00:42:52.390 --> 00:42:56.050
be really thinking about my
family intentionality. You literally have

800
00:42:56.050 --> 00:42:59.650
to reset yourself five, six,
seven times a day. Like,

801
00:42:59.670 --> 00:43:02.770
like literally right now, I'm
I am. I just realized

802
00:43:02.770 --> 00:43:05.560
I was slouching. So now
I'm straightening my back and

803
00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:08.830
I'm trying to have good
posture. Mindfulness and intentionality is

804
00:43:08.830 --> 00:43:14.950
literally catching yourself and your
bad posture multiple times a

805
00:43:14.950 --> 00:43:18.700
day and then straightening it.
So it's not twice a

806
00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:21.190
year going. I should spend
more time with my kids.

807
00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:24.850
It's twice a day going,
wow. Like my 11 year

808
00:43:24.850 --> 00:43:26.860
old just asked to play
a game with me. That

809
00:43:26.860 --> 00:43:30.010
was a missed opportunity. Can
I run in there now?

810
00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:32.170
Like I remember this 15
minutes after he asked me,

811
00:43:32.170 --> 00:43:34.300
can I run over there
and talk to him today?

812
00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:37.600
Immediately, the fact, you know,
fail fast, fail often. Right?

813
00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:39.250
I'm going to catch that
as much as you can.

814
00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:41.830
So like right now I'm
on vacation. I'm not even

815
00:43:41.830 --> 00:43:43.720
supposed to be talking to.
Y'all like, I'm not even

816
00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:46.960
supposed to come to work
today, but my wife's asleep.

817
00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:48.730
Cause she's going to work
tonight. The kids don't come

818
00:43:48.730 --> 00:43:52.870
back from school for 11
minutes. Therefore I enjoy this.

819
00:43:52.870 --> 00:43:55.900
It feeds my spirit. So
why don't I hang out

820
00:43:55.900 --> 00:44:00.760
with y'all? Does that make
sense? Yeah, that makes a

821
00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:03.250
lot of sense, actually. Yeah.
Yeah. So if, but here's

822
00:44:03.250 --> 00:44:04.930
the other thing, and this
is, this is sounds silly

823
00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:07.030
and it definitely will not
like be in the style

824
00:44:07.030 --> 00:44:11.470
of my typical podcast, but
someone told me that they

825
00:44:11.470 --> 00:44:13.960
wanted to do something like
learn a language or like,

826
00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:16.690
I just can't find the
time. And I said, do

827
00:44:16.690 --> 00:44:19.840
you poop every day? And
they were like, yeah, I'm

828
00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:21.490
usually poop. I was like,
do you find time for

829
00:44:21.490 --> 00:44:23.470
that? Like you, you be
able to fit that into

830
00:44:23.470 --> 00:44:26.620
your busy schedule. And they
were like, yeah. And I

831
00:44:26.620 --> 00:44:28.390
was like, well, I mean,
it must be important. Huh?

832
00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:30.910
They're like, yeah, well you
will find time for important

833
00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:33.810
won't ya? Well, yeah. Well
then is this important or

834
00:44:33.810 --> 00:44:38.100
not? And they were like,
Oh right, like what's important.

835
00:44:38.310 --> 00:44:41.880
You have to go and
ask yourself to that original

836
00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:44.220
thing at the beginning of
this conversation, if it's not

837
00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:47.340
underscore making me money, allow
me to be, to close

838
00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:50.100
my family, getting connected with
my kids, then it, then

839
00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:52.890
you drop it out. Right.
So what are the things

840
00:44:52.890 --> 00:44:54.840
that like, isn't it amazing
how there's people who are

841
00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:56.850
complaining, how they can't finish
that book or write that

842
00:44:56.850 --> 00:44:59.040
blog post, but they seem
to find time to binge

843
00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:02.790
watch on stranger things nine,
right? Like if stranger things,

844
00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:05.190
nine feed your spirit, great
do that. But you don't

845
00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:07.410
get to watch nine hours
of Netflix and complain. You

846
00:45:07.410 --> 00:45:10.410
can't find time to blog
or, you know, you can't

847
00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:13.200
watch an entire six seasons
of the wire and then

848
00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:16.950
say, I don't hang out
with my kids. That's fair.

849
00:45:17.010 --> 00:45:19.200
Yeah. That's how I look
about it. What do you,

850
00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:21.800
what do you think? No,
I, I like that. It's

851
00:45:22.250 --> 00:45:25.220
my husband. I we're both
workaholics. And so we were

852
00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:27.410
blessed both now that we
can be at home. So

853
00:45:27.410 --> 00:45:30.110
we go on walks twice
a day to reconnect and

854
00:45:30.110 --> 00:45:34.190
kind of love it. And
so we're just faucet works.

855
00:45:34.190 --> 00:45:36.020
I'm just, I want to
make sure that it's going

856
00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:38.060
to continue work and it's
just something that's freaking me

857
00:45:38.060 --> 00:45:41.690
out. When I see that
he's gonna change his track

858
00:45:41.690 --> 00:45:43.460
a little bit and I'm
going to change my track.

859
00:45:43.730 --> 00:45:45.080
And so I just kind
of wanted to hear it

860
00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:47.270
from you what you do.
Yeah. Yeah. Well, another great

861
00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:49.220
example that I used was
that my wife has an

862
00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:51.350
MBA and she does all
this. She was a finance

863
00:45:51.350 --> 00:45:54.410
person. She worked at a
nonprofit and then one day,

864
00:45:54.530 --> 00:45:57.500
like on a random Tuesday,
she says, I want to

865
00:45:57.500 --> 00:46:01.250
be a nurse. So then
it's like, okay, fear, uncertainty,

866
00:46:01.250 --> 00:46:03.050
doubt. Ah, do you think
that's a good idea, blah,

867
00:46:03.050 --> 00:46:05.740
blah, blah. And all of
the standard, like, is this,

868
00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:07.160
you know, like all of
the reasons that I could

869
00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:09.230
say no, right, but then
the whole no, no, no.

870
00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:11.600
And it was like, okay,
well, yes. And do you

871
00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:15.290
want to be a nurse?
Okay. Let's figure out what

872
00:46:15.290 --> 00:46:16.820
that's going to look like.
So we sat down and

873
00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:19.070
we planned it and it's
like, okay, here's, what's going

874
00:46:19.070 --> 00:46:22.370
to change. Here's how the
kids won't, you know, we'll

875
00:46:22.370 --> 00:46:24.440
go to school and Scott,
you're going to have to

876
00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:26.510
change your schedule so I
can be studying. And I'm

877
00:46:26.510 --> 00:46:29.360
going to be working nights
now that da, and we

878
00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:32.780
put together a plan. So
for any thing you want

879
00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:35.900
to do, you can't just
slide, blogging and twitching into

880
00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:38.630
your day and hope it
fits. You have to sit

881
00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:41.300
down and look at your
current situation and say, all

882
00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:43.070
right. If everything were to
change, I'm going to become

883
00:46:43.070 --> 00:46:44.660
a nurse. If I'm going
to become a lawyer, if

884
00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:46.340
I'm going to quit my
job and Twitch full time,

885
00:46:46.550 --> 00:46:48.470
what would that look like?
And then you plan it

886
00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:50.240
and then you execute on
the plan and then if

887
00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:53.660
it didn't work, then you
adjust the plan. Yeah, that

888
00:46:53.660 --> 00:46:55.790
sounds great, actually. Thank you.
Thank you. Yes. Thank you

889
00:46:55.790 --> 00:46:59.630
for the question. So in,
in chat, when you were

890
00:46:59.630 --> 00:47:03.320
talking about succeeding and failing,
there was a comment from

891
00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:05.420
talk to me, goose, man,
that's our friend, Eric Huseman

892
00:47:07.010 --> 00:47:11.030
about how being laid off
from his job actually helped

893
00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:15.260
change and, and redirect him
in a better direction. Let

894
00:47:15.260 --> 00:47:17.390
me unmute him so we
can talk about that real

895
00:47:17.390 --> 00:47:20.240
quick. Yeah. It's great hearing,
hearing you talk about these

896
00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:22.580
things, because these are types
of ideas that I've kind

897
00:47:22.580 --> 00:47:25.320
of internalized, but never thought
about as a, as a,

898
00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:28.490
as a whole. And one
thing I've always communicated was

899
00:47:28.730 --> 00:47:32.380
so out of college, I
got a job just doing

900
00:47:32.410 --> 00:47:37.240
Java Java development and for
the longest. And, and I

901
00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:40.900
worked at that company for,
for two, almost three years

902
00:47:41.410 --> 00:47:44.320
and getting laid off was
such a heartbreaking thing at

903
00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:47.890
the time. But after, you
know, going from there and

904
00:47:47.890 --> 00:47:50.860
getting introduced, and then that
kind of led going into

905
00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:55.630
web development from doing just
job application, eclipse plugin development.

906
00:47:56.410 --> 00:47:58.930
And, and, and when I
look back and kind of

907
00:47:58.930 --> 00:48:04.930
reflected on that, I realized
that the, the getting laid

908
00:48:04.930 --> 00:48:09.760
off looking back was actually
a great thing because I

909
00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:12.250
was just cruising. Like I
was, I was kind of

910
00:48:12.250 --> 00:48:13.930
like in this kind of
like dead end job, very

911
00:48:14.020 --> 00:48:19.240
underpaid. And in this, in
this tiny office and it

912
00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:23.200
made me realize that, you
know, like I should look

913
00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:26.080
back and reflect on what,
not just not for me,

914
00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:28.840
not work for just the
sake of working and earning,

915
00:48:29.410 --> 00:48:33.520
earning a living, but working
for my own wellbeing. And

916
00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:37.150
this kind of happened again,
they like are really solidified.

917
00:48:37.150 --> 00:48:39.640
That belief was when I
had gotten laid off at

918
00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:44.770
another again. And after getting
laid off, I realized I

919
00:48:44.770 --> 00:48:46.840
was kind of falling into
that red again of kind

920
00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:51.280
of cruising. And now, you
know what, living two lessons.

921
00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:54.910
And now I, I definitely
follow that kind of philosophy

922
00:48:54.910 --> 00:48:58.630
of, of, you know, if
I being happy at what

923
00:48:58.630 --> 00:49:01.000
I do and trying to
do the best of what

924
00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:04.630
I do. And, and that's,
I feel like the, my,

925
00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:08.530
and that's actually what led
into me doing Twitch in

926
00:49:08.530 --> 00:49:12.310
the first place is being
inspired to create and pursue.

927
00:49:12.310 --> 00:49:15.610
Because if you just cruise
you don't, you do nothing.

928
00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:17.800
And you just kinda sit
there and watch Netflix all

929
00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:22.680
day, Keeping it really 100
when you're in the car

930
00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:26.280
and you are driving and
you're not touching your phone,

931
00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:28.080
of course, like you never
touch your phone in the

932
00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:31.380
car. Right. And then you
touch your damn phone and

933
00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:33.510
you almost hit somebody and
you get that moment where

934
00:49:33.510 --> 00:49:37.260
you're fine and everything's great.
And then it's like, Oh,

935
00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:39.000
you know, we've all had
that experience in a car,

936
00:49:39.060 --> 00:49:41.790
right. Where it's like, Holy
crap. I almost died. I

937
00:49:41.790 --> 00:49:44.790
almost killed everyone. I am
never touching my phone again.

938
00:49:46.050 --> 00:49:48.510
That's where life has like
smacked you in the head

939
00:49:49.050 --> 00:49:51.690
and you have decided to
take it and make a

940
00:49:51.690 --> 00:49:54.570
change or not. The fact
is though, you will then

941
00:49:54.570 --> 00:49:58.170
fall back into your existing
thing and you'll touch your

942
00:49:58.170 --> 00:50:00.480
phone again. And then it
will happen again. The trick

943
00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:03.390
is to make the distance
between the having life smack

944
00:50:03.390 --> 00:50:06.180
you in the face, the
farther and farther and farther.

945
00:50:06.270 --> 00:50:08.220
So it's not hitting you
in the face daily, it's

946
00:50:08.220 --> 00:50:10.800
hitting in the face like
yearly or whatever. So for

947
00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:14.610
you getting laid off was
the reality check. As they

948
00:50:14.610 --> 00:50:16.950
say that let's smack you
and like, Oh crap. I

949
00:50:16.950 --> 00:50:21.840
need to like, think about
stuff for me. My wife

950
00:50:21.870 --> 00:50:25.470
got cancer. So we had
our cancer year. I've had

951
00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:29.030
other moments. It's like, Oh
crap, this is a thing.

952
00:50:29.540 --> 00:50:32.360
And I need to change.
Now that I'm getting older

953
00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:36.920
and I'm like, creaking, physically
physical stuff makes you realize,

954
00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:39.590
Oh wow, like I'm starting
to hurt. I need to

955
00:50:39.590 --> 00:50:42.590
start working out more or
I'm I need to eat

956
00:50:42.590 --> 00:50:44.300
better. Or I got my
blood work back from my

957
00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:47.000
doctor yesterday and I need
to change it if you

958
00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:50.750
don't have mindfulness, those, those
little things where like the

959
00:50:50.750 --> 00:50:52.790
universe is checking in with
you and making sure that

960
00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:56.030
you're growing get ignored. And
I feel like people who

961
00:50:56.030 --> 00:50:59.510
aren't growing sometimes get reminded
more who aren't. And it's

962
00:50:59.510 --> 00:51:02.030
really our, our job to
listen to the universe, poking

963
00:51:02.030 --> 00:51:06.110
at us and reminding us
that we need to, we

964
00:51:06.110 --> 00:51:08.030
need to listen. Now. I
think it's horrible that you

965
00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:11.000
were laid off. And I'm
not saying that, you know,

966
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.280
you just, you decide whether
the universe gave it to

967
00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:14.750
you because you needed it.
But you know how they

968
00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:17.150
always say, God doesn't do
anything to us that we

969
00:51:17.150 --> 00:51:19.760
can't handle. You know, it
sounded like it was exactly

970
00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:22.070
what you needed at the
time. And if you weren't,

971
00:51:22.070 --> 00:51:24.590
if you weren't listening though,
it might've happened again and

972
00:51:24.590 --> 00:51:27.710
again. Yeah. I'm totally happy.
I got laid off. So

973
00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:30.320
I'm happy. It's still kind
of sucks though. I mean,

974
00:51:30.410 --> 00:51:35.090
you know, that's, that's where
you make like, plans, right.

975
00:51:35.090 --> 00:51:38.720
And prepare for the unexpected.
Yeah. Not, not everybody is

976
00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:41.330
prepared to get laid off
financially or emotionally, but it

977
00:51:41.330 --> 00:51:46.940
sounds like you were thanks
for all the advice. All

978
00:51:46.940 --> 00:51:50.990
right, Scott, that's a, that's
been an hour already. Really?

979
00:51:51.590 --> 00:51:55.430
Can you believe it? Oh,
okay. Thank you so much

980
00:51:55.430 --> 00:51:57.320
for player just said, Oh
God, I missed it. It

981
00:51:57.320 --> 00:52:01.070
was recorded. It's recorded. And
certainly the thing that you

982
00:52:01.070 --> 00:52:04.820
can do, new friends is
take any, and all of

983
00:52:04.820 --> 00:52:09.020
the I shared in the,
in the links and you

984
00:52:09.020 --> 00:52:11.570
can share them out on
Twitter or your various and

985
00:52:11.570 --> 00:52:14.390
sundry social things. The number
one thing that you can

986
00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:18.290
do to me as a
gift is if I've provided

987
00:52:18.290 --> 00:52:20.960
you some value, then you
can share that widely with

988
00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:25.520
your, your friends and coworkers
that helps me share them

989
00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:27.980
on the street and say,
Hey, look what I learned

990
00:52:27.980 --> 00:52:31.730
from Scott. Share all the
things. Well, that was a

991
00:52:31.730 --> 00:52:34.040
show. I hope that you
enjoyed it. At least you

992
00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:36.980
got some value out of
it. Maybe one little snippet

993
00:52:37.010 --> 00:52:40.700
of wisdom there a little
bit, but here's the ending.

994
00:52:41.150 --> 00:52:44.150
This has been another episode
of Hansel minutes. And we'll

995
00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:59.890
see you again next week.
