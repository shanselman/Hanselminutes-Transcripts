00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.390
web developer and technologists. Scott
Hanselman. This is Lawrence Ryan announcing

In this episode of the

7
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.510
startup series, Scott talks with
Rob walling about purchasing small

8
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:52.770
companies or online applications and
revitalizing them. Hi, this is

9
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.960
Scott Hanselman, and this is
another episode of Hansel minutes

10
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.380
and I'm doing the startup
series. As I discovered. Interesting

11
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.560
new startups. It's not necessarily
a regular thing, but here's

12
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.350
two in a row. We're
talking to Rob walling who

13
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.230
has an interesting startup story
because he has acquired some

14
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.080
code that well, maybe, maybe
I wouldn't have acquired. I

15
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.700
don't know, Rob, how's it
going? It's going well, thanks

16
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.050
for having me The product
that was already out there.

17
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.290
You acquired some data. Tell
me about what you, what

18
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.530
you got. Yeah, so the
product is called a hit

19
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.390
tail and it was built
in, I think in 2005,

20
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.400
I think it either went
live in late 2005 or

21
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.780
2006 and shockingly enough, it
was written in classic ASP.

22
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.720
I don't know why they
didn't do.net, you know? Cause

23
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.700
it was, I mean that
we were at dotnet two.

24
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.240
Oh, by then three, two
to five anyways. Yeah. So

25
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.340
they, they wrote a classic
HP and I've been a

26
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.940
customer of it for several
years. It's essentially a, it's

27
00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.270
an application that gives you
suggestions for keywords that you

28
00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.110
should target if you do
search engine optimization. And so

29
00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.980
I've been a customer for
several years and it started

30
00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.340
having a lot of downtime
due to hardware problems. The

31
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.670
code is actually has been
quite solid, but they were

32
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.880
having servers that were failing
and, and such. So in

33
00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.910
2011 they had like a
five day outage at one

34
00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.780
point. And so I basically
got in touch with the

35
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.560
former owner and, and acquired
the product and we closed

36
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.250
late August of 2011. You
know, it was written in

37
00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.300
classic ASP. I didn't not
until I got in touch

38
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.020
with her, I, I should've
looked. I mean, everything has

39
00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.090
the ASP extension. I had
just never paid attention. You

40
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.400
know, when you use a
software as a service app,

41
00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.770
I don't tend to look
at the extension of things.

42
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.130
And I had no idea
if it was PHP or,

43
00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.390
or yeah. asp.net or anything
Just never thought about it.

44
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.130
Never consciously came to the
forefront. Yeah. Yeah. Most apps

45
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.840
that I use. I don't,
I mean, I don't know

46
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.820
about most people, but I
don't even as a developer.

47
00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.470
I mean, I've been writing.net
since, since 2002 and classic

48
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.530
ASP before then. I don't
sometimes I'll look, if I'm

49
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.960
curious, if something's particularly slick,
I'll say, Oh, is this

50
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.480
a Microsoft thing? You know,
is it written in stuff

51
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.310
I work in because I
can be really proud of

52
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.030
it, but not, you know,
not for, for most apps.

53
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.890
I think I just go
about, go about doing it

54
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.450
without asking. I ask them
what the written, I, I

55
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.840
wrote a blog post last
week about what I called

56
00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.390
dark matter developers and talking
about the developers that we

57
00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.130
don't see on the blogs.
And they don't go to

58
00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.830
conferences and stuff. And a
lot of people understood where

59
00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.400
I was coming from, but
an reasonably large group of

60
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.560
people felt they were kind
of offended because I was

61
00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.750
implying that people who were
on the blogs and presumably

62
00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.910
people like myself. So I
think I was, there was

63
00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.730
some ego that was associated
with that post imply that

64
00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.500
we're, you know, we're moving
the web forward while you

65
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.920
guys kind of sit in
the background, work on classic

66
00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.140
ASP and cobalt and stuff
like that. So then a

67
00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.700
large amount of people kind
of came out of the

68
00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.770
darkness and said, you know,
we're getting work done. We're

69
00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.890
doing really useful stuff. I'm
working on, you know, code

70
00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.960
that might be 20 or
30 years old. But you

71
00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.840
know, you just can't, you
can't beat an RPG program

72
00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.640
on an ASMR 400 when
it comes to like raw

73
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.760
productivity even now. So I
thought it was interesting that

74
00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.050
a number of people were
like, can you just because

75
00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:11.850
you can't see us doesn't
mean we're not getting a

76
00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.430
lot at work done. And
I, I realized that posts

77
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.530
may have come off that
way. So I don't want

78
00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.040
to sound like classic ASP.
I'm like, I'm looking down

79
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.370
on it because not everyone
knows there's perfectly good work

80
00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.700
being done right now and.net
one and two. But at

81
00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.150
the same time, I do
remember doing classic ASP more

82
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.030
than 10 years ago. I
think even 15 years ago,

83
00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.900
when you saw that, did
you, when you're, you're, you're

84
00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.760
in the, you're in the
process, you're having the conversation,

85
00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.890
did it, did it give
you pause at all? Did

86
00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:44.520
you look down your nose
at this classic ASP and

87
00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.790
maybe not thinking about not
acquiring it? It did give

88
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.270
me pause. And the biggest,
the biggest reason was, is

89
00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.640
not even looking down my
nose at it. It was

90
00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.820
more of a, can I
go back to that development

91
00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.330
environment? Can I go back
to not being able to

92
00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.030
step through debug and do
response to that rights and

93
00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.650
having weekly type variables and
just, just all the stuff

94
00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.440
that comes along with that.
And I, I just remember

95
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.830
the transition from classic ASP
to.net as I made it

96
00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.760
back in 2001, 2002 and
how good that felt. And

97
00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.160
I kept, I don't even,
I didn't even really remember

98
00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.100
classic ASB. I haven't touched
it since then. It's been

99
00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.310
10 years. And so all
I remembered it was kind

100
00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.160
of dark, dark memories in
my head of, of being

101
00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.530
frustrated and not being able
to debug as well as

102
00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.070
I wanted. And so it
did give me some pause,

103
00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.940
but there was, there's so
much value in this product

104
00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.180
that I was going to
acquire, that I knew. I

105
00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.580
knew a, that I'd be
able to get over that,

106
00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.730
you know, and I, I
deal with it and write

107
00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:52.260
the code and be, I
am going to wind up

108
00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:54.750
hiring someone part time to
help me out with it.

109
00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:55.920
So I won't be, it's
not like I'm going to

110
00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.190
be coding a classic 40
hours a week for the

111
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.310
next five years. Right. I'm,
I'm actually, you know, I

112
00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:04.240
have outs where I don't
have to do that. So

113
00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.550
when you, when you purchase
something, when you acquire a

114
00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.880
product, you know, there's, there's
the perceived value of this

115
00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.160
product. And then there's this
kind of imaginary pie chart

116
00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:15.160
that represents all of the
intellectual property that makes up

117
00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:19.150
that product. Is this thing,
like half code and half

118
00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.790
data, or what does that
pie chart look like? Like

119
00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:24.070
how much of this is
legacy code and versus how

120
00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:25.870
much of this is just
really interesting data that's in

121
00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:27.880
a database somewhere. Because I
think if a lot of

122
00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:30.220
it was data, I would
feel more comfortable about older

123
00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.520
code, Right? In terms of
the value of actually paying

124
00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.760
for this And also feeling
like I wouldn't be mess,

125
00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:38.980
like, like, let's say it
was 90% data and 10%

126
00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:42.220
code, and it represented a
couple of thousand lines of

127
00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:45.250
code since it's classic ASP,
I would feel very comfortable

128
00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:48.460
rewriting it in, in PHP
or reading, writing, and an

129
00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:52.510
asp.net web pages. Right. I
see. Yeah, there is a

130
00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:55.030
tremendous, there's, there's more than
a billion rows in the

131
00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:59.440
database, SQL server, 2005 database,
and it's about 300 gigs

132
00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:03.040
of data. And so that
contains a lot of, of

133
00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.440
the kind of intelligence, you
know, and, and a lot

134
00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.640
of the legacy of the
app and a lot of

135
00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:10.600
the value of actually acquiring
it. There are, I would

136
00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:15.880
estimate maybe I don't think
there are 10,000 lines somewhere

137
00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.950
in the five to 10,000
lines of code range. And

138
00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:19.660
there's, there's quite a bit
of JavaScript. There's a lot

139
00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:22.750
of hand coded JavaScript because
there wasn't, there was no

140
00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:25.570
jQuery back then. And so
there's Ajax in there. That's

141
00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:29.050
been just hand coded from
scratch. And then there's, you

142
00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:31.720
know, ton of ASP. I
think that one of the

143
00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:35.500
things that, that made me
realize that I should acquire

144
00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:38.650
the product is that this
code has been running. And

145
00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:41.470
for the last three years,
it's been running essentially without

146
00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:45.100
technical maintenance at all, because
the original developers left in

147
00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:48.190
2008, they moved on to
other projects. And so the

148
00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:52.060
former owners nontechnical, and so
there was no database re-indexing,

149
00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:55.210
there were no code changes.
It was pretty much just

150
00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:58.750
running and it was running
solid. The app actually does

151
00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:01.510
a lot of real time.
It takes a lot of

152
00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:03.640
real time data from websites,
right? It's almost like Google

153
00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:06.430
analytics where you install a
little snippet of JavaScript on

154
00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:08.470
your website as a customer.
And then every time you

155
00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:11.260
get a hit from a
search engine, it pings back

156
00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.350
to the main server and
it stores it in, in

157
00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.330
the Hidell database. So it's
not a trivial app. There's

158
00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:19.000
actually a lot of volume.
There can be 20, 30

159
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.880
database inserts per second at
peak times. And this thing

160
00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:25.270
ran without modification and without
maintenance for three years. So

161
00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:27.610
that was actually, even though
it's old code, that was

162
00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:29.740
a, you know, kind of
a, a reason for me

163
00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:32.560
to think about how solid
this old code was, because

164
00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:34.420
it has run for so
many years and it has

165
00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:36.860
been debugged. So I think
there's a lot of value

166
00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:40.120
in that. So how does
the code and the way

167
00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.920
the code was written relate
to the fact that the

168
00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:44.860
database is so big and
the database is apparently well-designed

169
00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:47.800
and perhaps organized enough that
it's doing it, you know,

170
00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:51.010
appropriate indexing and it didn't
require database checks and things

171
00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:53.170
like that. That sounds like
you're saying SQL certain I'm

172
00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:55.890
brainstorming here. I'm pushing a
little bit, but it sounds

173
00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:58.590
like you're saying SQL server
2005 is really good. How

174
00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:01.550
does that make the code
really good? Yeah. I guess

175
00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:03.680
all I'm saying is the
code is efficient and the

176
00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:07.910
code, it doesn't have any
major bugs like it, they

177
00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:09.860
worked all of that out
in the early days. And

178
00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:11.690
for the fact that the
code to continue to run

179
00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:14.180
like that you're right. It
is, it probably is more

180
00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:17.060
of a SQL server thing,
but, but just that it

181
00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:18.830
has a lot of kinks
worked out. And so I

182
00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:21.140
could have rewritten, I mean,
rewriting his tail. I was

183
00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:22.610
either going to do it
myself or, you know, get

184
00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:24.260
some help and do it
if I wasn't able to

185
00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.620
acquire it. Cause I really
liked the idea. It would,

186
00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:30.950
it would take, you know,
four to six months to

187
00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:33.770
do it full time, but
I knew that you'd have

188
00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:36.440
to go through all the
headaches and all the, the

189
00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:39.020
trials and tribulations that they
went and went through in

190
00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:41.210
the early days to make
this a good product and

191
00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:45.080
not have to go through
those again, The, the database

192
00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:47.810
that, that it went down
for five days. So it

193
00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:50.150
went great for three years
and everything was great. And

194
00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:53.210
you said, this is really
a really valuable piece of

195
00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:55.430
intellectual property here. And then
it went down for five

196
00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:57.830
days. When did that five
days happen? And how does

197
00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:00.350
that not erode your confidence
in a previous three years,

198
00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:04.310
Right? Yeah. What was actually
happening? It was going down

199
00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:07.310
probably every couple of months,
every two to three months.

200
00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:11.180
And it was hardware failures.
So disc drives would fail,

201
00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:14.900
power supplies would fail that
kind of stuff. It was

202
00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:18.650
not, it was never to
my knowledge. And I talked

203
00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:20.360
to the previous developers, it
was never the code or

204
00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.790
the database that was failing.
So that was actually the

205
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:25.130
first goal when I acquired
his tail was to get

206
00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:28.340
it off the old hardware.
Cause it was on generic,

207
00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:31.520
you know, not Dell, not
HP, just generic white box

208
00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:34.880
servers. And they had, I
think they'd been purchased used

209
00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:37.250
on eBay in 2006. I
mean, it was a really

210
00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:40.820
low budget operation. And so
obviously these, these hard drives

211
00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:44.390
failing is just, you know,
naturally going to happen. So

212
00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:46.610
yeah, the five day failure
came in, I think, may

213
00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:49.850
of 2011. And then I
wound up con contacting him

214
00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:54.590
in June and, and getting
it in, in August. And

215
00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:57.590
were they, were they like
excited about you calling them

216
00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:59.390
and they've forgotten about the
product or was this a

217
00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:01.100
product that was sitting in
the background doing a lot

218
00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:04.970
of work and, and making
money for them? It was,

219
00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:08.540
she was, so it was
down to a single owner

220
00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:12.590
and she was happy to
discuss the acquisition because she

221
00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:15.410
knew that the product had,
it has so much intelligence

222
00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:18.560
in it and it has
a lot of potential and

223
00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.030
it had done a lot
of good things for a

224
00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:21.890
lot of people as they've
used it over the years

225
00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:24.410
and she thought failing and
that painter to do it,

226
00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:26.630
but she didn't have the
time or the resources to

227
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:28.730
kind of re rehab it
basically. I mean, it's kinda

228
00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:30.740
like that old broken down
house that has so much

229
00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:33.560
potential needs, a new coat
of paint and some, maybe

230
00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:38.090
some new electrical. And she,
they really did. They do

231
00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:40.340
and did love the product
and they're still fans of

232
00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:42.530
it, you know? And so
the fact that someone was

233
00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:47.150
willing to come along and
talk about revitalizing it and

234
00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:49.820
they know most of the
customers, I'm never, you know,

235
00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:52.730
a hundred or 200 customers
when I acquired it. And

236
00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:54.280
they know a lot of
them by first name. So

237
00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:57.280
they were all excited that,
that it would actually have

238
00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:00.990
a second life essentially. What
have you done to it?

239
00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:03.090
Since I assume you've been
sitting with the hardware, I

240
00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:05.160
mean, when someone purchase a
fixer upper and they're excited

241
00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:08.520
about it, it does breathe
new energy into the, into

242
00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:11.220
the house, into the product.
What have you done in

243
00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:15.420
that, in those, in that
way? Yeah, over the past,

244
00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:17.790
it's been about six months,
six and a half months

245
00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:20.580
since I acquired it. And
I had really three, three

246
00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:26.100
goals. The first priority was
to get it stable, meaning

247
00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:29.580
get it on the new
hardware. And then second was

248
00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:34.470
to basically redesign the app,
not from a backend stance,

249
00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:36.630
but the front end was
very dated. And so I

250
00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:38.820
just wanted a new marketing
site that would help with

251
00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:42.600
basically help people have more
confidence in the application. Cause

252
00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:45.390
it looked like something from,
you know, a ten-year-old app.

253
00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:47.610
And then the third thing
was to, to get the

254
00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:51.870
marketing started. And so the
really that first priority of

255
00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:56.670
stabilizing it involved, moving it
from the old hardware to

256
00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:59.400
a new colo facility, I'm
actually hosting with orcs web

257
00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:03.540
or RCS, web Virginia, and
I'm on one of their

258
00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:07.440
cloud servers. And it was
a big, that was quite

259
00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:09.510
a big deal to move
it because it's not, you

260
00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:11.760
know, it's not a trivial
task to move a 300

261
00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:14.520
gig database. You can't just
send that across the internet,

262
00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:17.730
especially when there's, it's real
time. There's there's between five

263
00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:21.660
and 30 database inserts happening
every second. And so I

264
00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:25.080
had to actually hire the
DBA to help me out

265
00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:27.450
because I wasn't able to,
I just didn't even really

266
00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:29.940
know how to attack that
problem. And so he helped

267
00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:33.960
setting up replication between two
instances and it was so

268
00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:37.770
it was sending data over
the wire to Virginia. And

269
00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:40.500
then we had a, we
had a USP, we went

270
00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:42.840
with the old postal service
and got a U S

271
00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:46.680
you know, three, 500 gig
USB drive and put the

272
00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:50.340
database on it and then
shipped it overnight and got

273
00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:51.840
the big book of the
data over to the data

274
00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:53.430
center that way. And then
we pulled an all nighter

275
00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:56.790
to kind of get it
all synced up. Isn't that

276
00:13:56.790 --> 00:14:00.450
funny? How ups always talk
about that? How ups has

277
00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:03.900
more bandwidth than even the
fastest internet connection, if you

278
00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:07.680
can overnight, you know, half
a terabyte, then that's pretty

279
00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:09.060
darn good band with, if
you look at it like

280
00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:15.270
per second megabytes per second.
So you refresh all the

281
00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:18.480
hardware, you refresh the marketing
site. Is there an API

282
00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.340
that people call to talk
to this? And is it

283
00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:23.010
an old style one? Are
there new techniques around Jason

284
00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:26.700
or jQuery that someone might
use in order to access

285
00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:29.850
this data? Well, so the
data at this point, there

286
00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:32.880
is no API. It, I
have one in the works

287
00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:39.060
I've been building it, it
a rest API using the.net

288
00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:42.450
components. I just even remember,
it's funny, it's WCF, sorry

289
00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:44.910
that we CF has all
the, you know, the stuff

290
00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:46.770
in it to do a
really nice rest API. And

291
00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:50.490
so we're, we're about halfway
through that to get to

292
00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:52.460
the data. I mean, it's
really a reporting app. It's

293
00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:55.370
more like, think of it
like Google analytics, where you

294
00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:57.470
install the code on your
site, it puts it into

295
00:14:57.470 --> 00:14:59.660
a database and then you
log into our web portal

296
00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:03.250
and you can see all
the keywords that people have

297
00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:06.410
hit your site with. And
then we actually have an

298
00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:08.870
algorithm that gives you suggestions
in terms that you are

299
00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:11.300
not targeting, that you should
be targeting if you want

300
00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:16.250
more traffic and yeah. And
you can export everything to

301
00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:19.190
CSV. I mean, that's really
the, that's the other, the,

302
00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:21.800
you know, you said ups
has ultimate bandwidth. It's like

303
00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:24.320
CSV is the ultimate API.
Cause then you can do

304
00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:28.480
whatever you want with it.
When you start approaching someone

305
00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:30.640
about a product like this,
how do you even know

306
00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:32.920
in your mind where the
right number is? How do

307
00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:37.030
you know you didn't overpay
or underpay? Okay. Yeah, that's

308
00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:41.260
a really good question. There,
there are ranges kind of

309
00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:44.920
best practice ranges. I've acquired
a number of products over

310
00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:49.630
the past seven or eight
years. And in essence, depending

311
00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:52.120
on how, how long of
a history and earnings history,

312
00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.730
the product has, how much
money it's making per month

313
00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:59.740
and how much maintenance it
requires the range. It typically

314
00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:03.580
starts around 12 months of
monthly net profit. So like

315
00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:06.280
a one year, one year's
worth. But if the product

316
00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:07.810
is in bad shape or
it needs a lot of

317
00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:10.210
work or it needs a
lot of monthly maintenance, then

318
00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:13.030
it might be four to
six months of monthly net

319
00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:15.550
profit. And if it's a
really good product, that's been

320
00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:19.960
mentioned in a lot of,
of, you know, print magazines,

321
00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:22.570
or like this one had
been mentioned, a tech crunch

322
00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:24.190
and wall street journal. And
I mean, it was a

323
00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:26.260
big, big app back in
the day when it launched,

324
00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:29.380
then it has more clout.
It just has more inbound

325
00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:32.740
links. It has more SEO
traffic. It has more kind

326
00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:35.050
of more to it than
being some, some trivial app.

327
00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:39.820
It can sell for upwards
of 24, maybe even up

328
00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:42.820
to 30 months of net
profit. So it's kind of

329
00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:44.680
your range that you go
into, you can do it

330
00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:47.710
with, which is very different
from, you know, dot com,

331
00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:50.680
valuations. A lot of people,
if you approach them about

332
00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:53.410
their product, they feel like,
well, Facebook sells for, you

333
00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:56.620
know, it's valued at X
dollars per free user that

334
00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:58.990
they have. And that's, that's
not really how it works

335
00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:01.720
with these smaller apps. It
Mo is much more based

336
00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:05.800
on the, kind of the
earnings and earnings multiple. So

337
00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:07.930
what, what is the difference?
You're saying that, that someone

338
00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:12.310
might have a product with
10,000 users and they might

339
00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:14.350
be thinking it's like Facebook
and think that it's a

340
00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:17.380
per user evaluation. Well, the
real thing that they should

341
00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:19.810
be using is they've made
a thousand dollars a month

342
00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:21.350
for the last 12 months,
and this is how much

343
00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:25.360
it's important. Yeah. I w
I mean, I'll say that

344
00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:28.870
it's kind of like what's
generally accepted versus what is

345
00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:33.550
it's like, what does everyone
use versus what someone thinks

346
00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:38.200
their app is worth particularly?
So that's kind of confusing

347
00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:41.290
there. There's kind of this
whole, this whole group of

348
00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:44.800
people that are buying and
selling these apps and websites,

349
00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:48.400
it's, there's a group on
Flippa flippa.com. There's a group

350
00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:53.280
on site point. They multiples
is how multiples are, how

351
00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:56.130
these things are typically valued,
but that doesn't mean everyone

352
00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:57.840
has to adhere to that,
right? If someone does have

353
00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:00.120
10,000 users and they say,
well, my app, I'm not

354
00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:01.680
going to sell it for
less than 50 or a

355
00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:04.110
hundred grand, then that's up
to them. It's just, they

356
00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:06.000
have to find a buyer
who's willing to do that.

357
00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:08.400
And if they go with
folks who typically buy apps,

358
00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:10.710
they're probably not going to
find someone to do that.

359
00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:14.850
You know, it really is
a difference between buying small,

360
00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:20.970
smaller, profit generating apps and
going with the.com valuations. If

361
00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:23.490
you start an app that
is going to be a

362
00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:25.500
social network and it is
going to be wildly successful,

363
00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:28.230
and you have 10,000 people
already, then maybe you could

364
00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:31.350
convince someone that it's going
to have massive growth, but

365
00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:33.780
an app like hit tail
or other apps that bought,

366
00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:35.730
they just, aren't going to,
they're going to scale up

367
00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:38.730
that quickly. And so they,
I would just, I would

368
00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:40.740
never value them based on
free users or anything. I

369
00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:43.110
mean, it's pretty, there's kind
of a, a formula that,

370
00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:45.770
that you can rely on
for that. So at that

371
00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:48.200
point, that means that you
were kind of at the,

372
00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:50.720
at the mercy of the
person who owns it, if

373
00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:54.350
they are delusional or confused,
or simply uneducated about the

374
00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:57.350
way things that work, you
might just not be, you

375
00:18:57.350 --> 00:19:00.770
might reach an impasse very
quickly in the discussion. Yup.

376
00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:03.230
Yup. And it's better to
reach that early, to be

377
00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:05.570
honest, before you'd spend a
lot of time on it

378
00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:07.310
or before you make them
spend a lot of time,

379
00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:09.290
you know, pulling a lot
of data out because frankly,

380
00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:12.050
before, before you make an
offer, you want to get

381
00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:15.830
a buck, you know, maybe
10 to 12 data points

382
00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:17.450
from them. You want to
know how much it's making

383
00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:21.500
the expenses, how much time
they spend per month, how,

384
00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:23.540
how much it costs them
to acquire a customer. I

385
00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:25.040
mean, there's kind of some
basic things you need to

386
00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:27.410
figure out in order to
figure out what, what this

387
00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:29.870
thing is worth, what your,
an offer for it. And

388
00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:31.640
so before you make them
go do all that legwork,

389
00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:35.020
I often will start chatting
them up about here's how

390
00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:36.560
it, you know, have you
heard about this? Here's how

391
00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:39.590
sites are typically valued. If
this isn't going to work,

392
00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:43.010
then that's fine, but let's
not waste your time or,

393
00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:46.280
or mine, frankly. It seems
like there's a delicate thing,

394
00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:48.960
though. It is delicate. I
mean, you don't want to

395
00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:51.380
say you're, you're the buyer.
You want to give them

396
00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:53.660
money and they want to
get as much money as

397
00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:55.790
they can. And you want
to pay as little as

398
00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:59.240
you can. And you're the
one educating them on what

399
00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:02.060
they needed to, to make
their price. Unless, cause if

400
00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:04.460
you're buying products all the
time and this is the

401
00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:07.130
first one they've ever sold,
they're going to be inherently

402
00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:11.210
distrustful of you. Yep. That's
true. That's true. And so

403
00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:14.870
that, frankly, my first several
emails, if I'm going to

404
00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:17.690
be acquiring something like this
tends to be, to build

405
00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:19.790
trust. And that's the goal
is to say, look, I

406
00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:22.820
I've done this before. Here's
my blog here, here I

407
00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:24.710
am on LinkedIn. Like I'm
a real person. I've written

408
00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:27.320
a book. I've I own
these other apps. Like I

409
00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:30.830
really try to be transparent
to say I'm accountable because

410
00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:33.740
I'm a real person. I'm
not just some email address.

411
00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:36.200
It's kind of emailing you
out of the blue and

412
00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:38.570
that you're you're right. It
is a balancing act of

413
00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:43.010
trying to, to build trust
quickly and show that I'm,

414
00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:46.400
you know, that I'm a
legitimate buyer and I'm not

415
00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:49.120
going to try to screw
around. In addition, I'm also

416
00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:51.220
trying to get pressed in
gain trust in them as

417
00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:55.330
a seller, because some sellers
may be a little, they

418
00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:57.790
may exaggerate their numbers, you
know, and you need to

419
00:20:57.790 --> 00:20:59.680
get proof of their numbers.
You need to get screenshots

420
00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:03.430
or screen tasks of their
actual traffic and their, and

421
00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:05.080
their revenue and such. And
so I'm trying to gauge

422
00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:08.440
the seller and typically really
enjoy having a, like a

423
00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:10.750
video Skype session with them.
Because when you can look

424
00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:13.330
someone in the eye, it
just, it, it means a

425
00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:17.280
lot in terms of, of
knowing, you know? Hmm. So

426
00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:18.690
email is not the place
where you do this kind

427
00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:21.000
of work. Like you may
email, you may set up

428
00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.740
some meetings and things like
that, but really you do

429
00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:24.990
need to see someone before
you give them a lot

430
00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:27.960
of money. A lot of
money. Yeah, yeah. Emails where

431
00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:31.800
we start setting it up.
And then typically the getting

432
00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:34.110
to know you and the
trust building is on just

433
00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:36.420
a single Skype session where
we'll just chat about stuff.

434
00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:39.030
I don't like to, I
mean, we don't negotiate over

435
00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:41.670
Skype because it's just, people
make time to think. And

436
00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:45.330
it's much easier to do
actual dollar negotiations and make

437
00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:47.460
the initial offer via email
and then just go back

438
00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:50.280
and forth via email. I
found it's better to do

439
00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:53.160
with things in writing as
well. So there's a track

440
00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:55.890
record of it. And that
means it takes a long

441
00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:57.630
time. You know, you don't,
I mean, it took me

442
00:21:57.780 --> 00:21:59.970
six, six or eight weeks
to, from the time I

443
00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:02.220
made the first offer on
this until we were able

444
00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:04.590
to close the deal, because
there's just a lot of

445
00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:07.290
back and forth about not
only price, but just other

446
00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:09.690
terms of who's going to
pay the legal fees. Cause

447
00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:10.920
there's, you know, we're going
to have to have a

448
00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:14.700
contract written up to close
this. Who's gonna go clear

449
00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:17.220
out the data center, the
old data center, you know,

450
00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:18.990
where they have their servers.
Cause someone has to go

451
00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:21.300
through to throw stuff in
the dumpster, that kind of

452
00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:22.860
stuff. So a lot of
different terms come up and

453
00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:24.420
it's good to have those
good to have an email

454
00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:27.600
trail of, of what we
discussed about. So it sounds

455
00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:30.750
like everything that could be
talked about gets talked about,

456
00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:33.600
I never would've thought about
who pays for the person

457
00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:36.450
who cleans up their old
data center. I mean, surely

458
00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:38.280
that can't be you, but
I wouldn't have even thought

459
00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:39.660
about it. But I think
your point is that if

460
00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:41.610
you don't write it down,
it will become a point

461
00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:45.570
of contention later. That's right.
Yep. And, and I wouldn't

462
00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:47.040
have thought about it either
to be honest, but she

463
00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:50.880
brought it up. So Out
of curiosity, who did end

464
00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:53.670
up paying for the dumpster
at the data center? She

465
00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:56.040
actually, the data center was
in New York and she lived

466
00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:58.350
in New York. So she volunteered
to go by and do

467
00:22:58.350 --> 00:23:01.380
it. I volunteered to pay
for legal expenses and she

468
00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:04.500
went and did it herself
and, and FedEx me the

469
00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:06.540
discs, you know, there are
a bunch of CD ROMs

470
00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:08.820
with install disks. And then
yeah, she did check the

471
00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:13.230
servers. I made sure that
she hit the hard drives

472
00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:16.020
with hammers and broke them
up because all the data,

473
00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:18.090
you know, you don't want
that getting out, but she

474
00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:21.270
checked everything in the dumpster.
Wow. It sounds like this

475
00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:22.830
is like a lot, like
buying a house and you

476
00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:24.690
really have to hope that
the seller of the house

477
00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:27.000
is a good person. And
you're not convinced that your

478
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.420
skeletons in the closet, That
that is true. No matter

479
00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:35.160
how much you put in
a contract, it never, it's

480
00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:37.470
never enough. If, if the
person is trying to screw

481
00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:39.150
you, they'll probably figure out
a way to do it.

482
00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:41.490
So you're right. You have
to trust. I think you

483
00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:44.970
have to trust from both
sides even today. You know,

484
00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:48.440
last week I figured out
that there's a Twitter account

485
00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:51.830
attached to hit tail. And
I just didn't know that

486
00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:54.470
I'd forgotten to mention it.
And so I emailed them

487
00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:57.500
and she's just like happy
to help. You know? It's

488
00:23:57.500 --> 00:23:59.750
like, she genuinely wants it
to succeed and she's not

489
00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:01.700
going to try to, I
mean, I could imagine some

490
00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:03.740
sellers saying, well, you didn't
negotiate for that. Well, I'm

491
00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:05.900
going to charge you for
it. It has 500 followers

492
00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:08.780
or whatever. Some people could
feasibly do that, but not,

493
00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:10.730
not with these guys. I
mean, they're just, they're really

494
00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:14.870
open to giving up the
assets that belong to it,

495
00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:17.450
even if they're not written
in the contract. And that's,

496
00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:20.050
that's a good thing to
have Such a challenge to,

497
00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:21.900
to, to know you have
to, you have to go

498
00:24:21.910 --> 00:24:23.350
through, if you do your
math, you have to do

499
00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:25.450
your data. You have to
do your due diligence. But

500
00:24:25.450 --> 00:24:26.890
then at the same time,
you are making a leap

501
00:24:26.890 --> 00:24:29.080
of faith and you have
to go with your gut.

502
00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:33.160
That's right. There is, there's
definitely some gut involved. And

503
00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:36.040
I think it gets easier.
Obviously, my first one was

504
00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:40.090
a lot scarier, but even
now what I find is

505
00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:42.400
that every time after I
close a deal, there's always

506
00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:45.610
some big surprise that I,
that I missed. And it's

507
00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:48.160
always something different, but there's
always something that I wake

508
00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:51.790
up, you know, three weeks
later. And I discover, Oh,

509
00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:54.220
either there wasn't as much
as I thought, or one

510
00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:56.980
of the numbers was wrong
and it wasn't intentionally wrong,

511
00:24:56.980 --> 00:24:59.440
but they had their database,
you know, with retail, as

512
00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:02.620
an example, their customer database
was just, was pretty fuzzy.

513
00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:05.320
And when I went in
and queried some things there

514
00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:08.950
weren't, there wasn't quite as
much, quite as much as

515
00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:13.060
many customers as we had
discussed. And it wasn't, she

516
00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:16.180
was genuinely looking at a
report that showed her ex

517
00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:18.070
and it was less than
X and is because their

518
00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:20.890
data was bad. So that
just is going to happen.

519
00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:22.900
And every time that happens,
I, I totally used that

520
00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:25.570
as motivation to, to grow
the thing, you know, rather

521
00:25:25.570 --> 00:25:27.250
than to be, to be
devastated that I made a

522
00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:31.750
mistake or something like that.
So was, was that, that

523
00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:34.450
was the surprise. That was
the, the quote unquote bad

524
00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:41.230
thing in this instance. Yeah.
It didn't sour me. No.

525
00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:43.840
I mean, it just made
me, it made me, I

526
00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:46.060
mean, let, it's, like I
said, I always know that

527
00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:49.570
there's going to be some
surprise and I was waiting

528
00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:52.300
for the shoe to drop,
frankly, when I found it,

529
00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:54.970
I was like, Oh, okay.
I can get over this.

530
00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:58.030
This is not that bad.
I remember thinking that I've

531
00:25:58.030 --> 00:26:00.610
had worse, you know, I've
had worse where I've acquired

532
00:26:00.610 --> 00:26:03.370
an app and an email,
the former or the current

533
00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:07.870
customers, and then just been
barraged with replies that say

534
00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:10.330
this app hasn't been supportive.
It has a bunch of

535
00:26:10.330 --> 00:26:14.320
bugs. The former owners were
trying to screw us. They

536
00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:16.990
didn't supply, they didn't release
new versions. And I, I

537
00:26:16.990 --> 00:26:18.820
just had no idea and
I should have done that

538
00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:20.920
in due diligence that wasn't
with hit tail that was

539
00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:23.800
with a former acquisition. And
so that one really panicked

540
00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:26.680
me because I started thinking,
wow, I, I kind of

541
00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:28.450
acquired a piece of crap
where I'm going to have

542
00:26:28.450 --> 00:26:30.070
to invest a bunch of
time, not only to fix

543
00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:33.040
the app, but then to
smooth this over with customers

544
00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:36.370
and then move forward. Whereas
with tail, at least the

545
00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:39.400
code was solid and the
customers signed from the downtime,

546
00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:41.260
which I knew I could
fix. They were, they were

547
00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:45.330
happy. So to find out
that there wasn't, maybe wasn't

548
00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:48.030
quite as much revenue, quite
as many customers as I

549
00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:49.530
thought it was, it wasn't
the end of the world.

550
00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:52.700
When, when you're doing a
startup or revitalizing a startup

551
00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:55.910
or putting more energy into
a product that has maybe

552
00:26:55.910 --> 00:27:01.100
plateaued a little bit, it,
it seems like the there's

553
00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:03.680
always a sense of urgency.
There's always this rush. Like

554
00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:05.990
if we don't provide value
in the next three months,

555
00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:09.110
six months, nine months, then
this thing will effectively be

556
00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:12.590
zero value. And it's always
that kind of internet panic,

557
00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:14.930
you know, the internet is
moving on without us. How

558
00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:17.780
do you know when a
product provides lasting value that

559
00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:21.110
has been around and will
be around versus maybe you

560
00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:23.240
just, you know, how do
you, how don't, you know,

561
00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:28.430
that his tail won't be
worthless in five years? That's

562
00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:31.340
a really, that's a really
good question, actually. So most

563
00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:34.970
of the, of the products
that I own are in,

564
00:27:35.290 --> 00:27:38.510
in smaller niches and they're
kind of evergreen in the

565
00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:41.120
sense that I have, I
own invoicing software. It's like

566
00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:43.090
people are always going to
need to invoice. You know,

567
00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:47.360
that's, that's not in the,
in the category of something

568
00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:50.390
that's going to go out
of style. Hidell is probably

569
00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:53.510
the most startup ish thing
that I've acquired where you're

570
00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:56.000
right. It could feasibly, you
know, what, if Google suddenly

571
00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.960
changed and decided not to
send any keywords, they've already

572
00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:02.930
made a change where if
you're logged into Google and

573
00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:05.690
you do a search, your
keywords are not sent to

574
00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:08.270
that website anymore. And so
now I can't get those

575
00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:11.780
through hotel. So it actually
reduces the number of keywords

576
00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:15.020
we can track by about
10%. But yeah, what if

577
00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:17.570
suddenly tomorrow Google turned off
the spigot the whole way

578
00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:20.450
and doesn't allow any keywords
hit. Tail would literally be

579
00:28:20.450 --> 00:28:22.460
out of business. There would
be no value in his

580
00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:24.470
tail. So there is a
risk there, and I knew

581
00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:28.430
that upfront, but at the
same time, it it's kind

582
00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:30.800
of a weighted risk, right?
It's like, I don't think

583
00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:33.710
Google is going to do
that. I know that this

584
00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:36.980
tool has run for five
and a half years and

585
00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:40.340
it's not algorithm dependent. It
doesn't depend on Google's algorithm.

586
00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.810
It has a code and
infrastructure that, that has run

587
00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:46.880
and that has worked, and
that has continued to provide

588
00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:49.760
value. I've been using it
myself. And so I knew

589
00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:51.680
that I didn't even have
to go ask customers if

590
00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:55.850
this thing worked. I knew
that it provided lasting value.

591
00:28:55.850 --> 00:28:59.210
So to look out five
years, yeah, there is, there

592
00:28:59.210 --> 00:29:01.250
is a chance that that
hit sale could just be

593
00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:04.100
put out of business by,
by something. But it's not

594
00:29:04.130 --> 00:29:07.280
as risky as something like
a, I don't know, maybe

595
00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:10.280
a Pinterest or a, you
know, a Foursquare where it

596
00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:12.500
really does things go in
and out of style, like

597
00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:15.650
you said, in nine months,
Hillsdale is, does have more

598
00:29:15.650 --> 00:29:17.990
of a business case. It
actually provides real value. And

599
00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:22.460
as long as people are
doing marketing online and meeting

600
00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:26.900
topics to talk about and
keyword suggestions, then, you know,

601
00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:29.530
hit tail, we'll have, it'll
have some value. So I

602
00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:32.900
do see it as a
longterm longterm app. Now this

603
00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:34.940
is the thing you do.
Like you, this has become

604
00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:36.970
your thing. Did you know
that you would go in

605
00:29:36.970 --> 00:29:40.280
and acquire a number of
small to medium sized products?

606
00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:42.580
I know you're building a
portfolio, like someone builds a

607
00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:46.450
portfolio of, of, of real
estate. I mean, it sounds

608
00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:50.010
like it, Yeah. I, I,
that is exactly what I've

609
00:29:50.010 --> 00:29:52.500
done. And I didn't really
set out to do that

610
00:29:52.530 --> 00:29:56.580
from the start, but I've
actually started getting contacted now

611
00:29:56.580 --> 00:30:00.180
by people who want to
sell apps and they'll say,

612
00:30:00.210 --> 00:30:02.370
Oh, I have a, an
app written in.net. It does

613
00:30:02.370 --> 00:30:05.970
this, are you interested? I've
heard you buy them. So

614
00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:09.810
I, I guess I had
good luck with the first

615
00:30:09.810 --> 00:30:12.810
few, and that has allowed
me to, I mean, eventually

616
00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:15.540
allowed me to quit consulting,
which freed up a whole

617
00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:18.330
bunch more time for me
to work on code and

618
00:30:18.330 --> 00:30:20.160
to do things that I
enjoy doing, which is, you

619
00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:24.570
know, working on these applications.
And then from there as

620
00:30:24.570 --> 00:30:28.170
new opportunities come by. I
mean, sometimes it's actually a

621
00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:31.320
lot, a lot of times
it's just a lot faster

622
00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:33.390
to buy it than it
is to build it. You

623
00:30:33.390 --> 00:30:36.510
know? And since I have
th there's money coming off

624
00:30:36.510 --> 00:30:38.400
of the apps that I've
already purchased, there's some money

625
00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:41.160
there to, to buy these
new ones. And so while

626
00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:44.790
it may, you know, may
cost, you know, 10 grand,

627
00:30:44.790 --> 00:30:46.770
20 grand to buy one
of these apps, it saves

628
00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:49.140
me and me and, or
a, you know, a developer

629
00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:52.170
who I would hire six
months of time. Then that's

630
00:30:52.170 --> 00:30:54.330
a pretty, it's kind of
a no brainer in terms

631
00:30:54.330 --> 00:30:57.840
of, of the payoff And
for how you want your

632
00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:02.130
portfolio to look. I do
have, I mean, I do

633
00:31:02.130 --> 00:31:04.710
have criteria. I really like
to stay in pretty small

634
00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:07.350
niches. I like for things
to be evergreen, like I

635
00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:09.060
said, meaning that they're going
to be able to serve

636
00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:11.310
customers for years. And it's
not some flash in the

637
00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:14.490
pan thing. I like my
wife's on Pinterest. And I

638
00:31:14.490 --> 00:31:17.430
think Pinterest is going to
be huge, but I will

639
00:31:17.490 --> 00:31:20.790
probably not buy anything dealing
with Pinterest because I just

640
00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:23.070
don't know. It's almost that,
you know, how Warren buffet

641
00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:25.590
doesn't invest in tech stocks.
I like to think of

642
00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:29.640
myself. Like I realized I'm,
I'm surrounded by technology, but

643
00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:33.330
I'm trying not to be
on, on those fast trains

644
00:31:33.330 --> 00:31:36.450
that can either skyrocket kind
of gold rush or they,

645
00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:38.940
they go up and then
crash pretty quick. And so

646
00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:42.090
I really do go after
smaller, more business oriented things

647
00:31:42.090 --> 00:31:44.550
that can be sold based
on value, meaning that they

648
00:31:44.550 --> 00:31:46.860
either save someone money or
they make them money because

649
00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:48.510
I don't know how to
sell. I wouldn't even know

650
00:31:48.510 --> 00:31:50.520
what to do with a
game. You know, as an

651
00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:52.560
example or a social network,
I wouldn't know how to

652
00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:55.740
market that. I wouldn't know
how to get people to

653
00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:57.720
use it. I mean, it
just doesn't make sense. Whereas

654
00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:00.450
I can tell someone, you
know, this will save you

655
00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:02.370
time on your invoicing, or
this will make you money

656
00:32:02.370 --> 00:32:05.580
because more people will pay.
That's a pretty, pretty, you

657
00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:09.450
know, a standard thing. And
all of my products, I

658
00:32:09.450 --> 00:32:12.360
liked your example early on,
when you said that people

659
00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:14.190
will always have to do
invoicing. You know, that's a

660
00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:18.090
very kind of fundamental attitude.
You know, there are things

661
00:32:18.090 --> 00:32:19.500
people will always want to
do it. Well, people always

662
00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:22.080
want to pin things to
their tumbler who knows, right?

663
00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:24.600
I mean, postures got bought
by Twitter a couple of

664
00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:27.600
days ago, which effectively means
postures is going to die.

665
00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:30.450
You know, it's just, it
was a ridiculous thing and

666
00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:32.520
everyone's going to lose, you
know, and if it's one

667
00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:34.590
of those products where they
make no money and they

668
00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:38.460
provide no actual business value,
they simply have users and

669
00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:41.390
users are, then I can
totally understand where you'd want

670
00:32:41.390 --> 00:32:43.850
to stay in a small
niche. I've heard from a

671
00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:47.120
number of people who make
small products that the nichier

672
00:32:47.390 --> 00:32:50.060
that you are the better.
Like, I know a guy

673
00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:54.140
who makes point of sale
software and backend office software

674
00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:58.020
for eye doctors. It's a
super niche and it's like

675
00:32:58.020 --> 00:33:02.590
six, like six people in
this space. Yep. And there's

676
00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:05.500
so many benefits that come
with that. You're a, you're

677
00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:10.030
you're marketing, you're not marketing
against large companies like Microsoft,

678
00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:13.300
who, who really, or Google
or Facebook who have big,

679
00:33:13.330 --> 00:33:15.490
big marketing budgets and who
really know what they're doing.

680
00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:19.750
You're marketing against other really
small companies. And in addition,

681
00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:22.120
if, if you do build
a better product, it actually

682
00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:24.940
can circulate because word of
mouth is really strong in

683
00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:29.620
small niches. And frankly, it's
just, if you are successful,

684
00:33:29.770 --> 00:33:31.570
no one's ever going to
swoop in from Google and

685
00:33:31.570 --> 00:33:34.600
try to attack that niche
and take you out. Whereas,

686
00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:36.790
you know, I do have
friends who launch in the

687
00:33:36.790 --> 00:33:40.390
larger niches and then, Oh,
Google implemented calendar, you know,

688
00:33:40.390 --> 00:33:42.080
and it puts, he go
out of business. I don't

689
00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:43.510
know if you remember them
or friend of mine was

690
00:33:43.510 --> 00:33:45.760
trying to do online before
Google docs. He was doing

691
00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:49.480
online word processing and then
Google bought rightly he was

692
00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:52.450
smoked. Like, you know, it,
it really is a matter

693
00:33:52.450 --> 00:33:54.130
of staying out of the
way of the giants. If

694
00:33:54.130 --> 00:33:55.780
you don't want to, if
you don't want to compete

695
00:33:55.780 --> 00:33:57.520
with them competing with them,
it's certainly not a bad

696
00:33:57.850 --> 00:34:00.070
strategy, but it's just not
something that I enjoy doing.

697
00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:02.230
I do like staying closer
to the code and being

698
00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:04.570
able to have, you know,
real software that provides value

699
00:34:04.570 --> 00:34:06.640
for businesses and, and does
it over the longterm. And

700
00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:09.730
that means that I will,
I will probably always stay

701
00:34:09.730 --> 00:34:12.550
with, with niches, frankly, hit
tail is the least niche

702
00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:14.740
product that I have. I
mean, it does, you know,

703
00:34:15.210 --> 00:34:19.000
it started more towards search
engine optimizers, people who run

704
00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.660
your shopping card, websites, eCommerce,
websites, and bloggers. And so

705
00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:26.050
there's a pretty broad niches,
frankly, all my other ones.

706
00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:29.890
Well, thanks for taking the
time to talk to us

707
00:34:29.890 --> 00:34:31.750
today. Robert really appreciate it.
This gives us an insight

708
00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:33.490
into a space that I
don't think everyone's familiar with.

709
00:34:34.150 --> 00:34:36.400
Yeah. I really appreciate you
having me. Thanks. Do you

710
00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:37.780
have a blog or anything?
We can point people to

711
00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:39.250
where they can learn more
about what you do and

712
00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:41.890
some of your plans. Yeah.
I'd blog at a software

713
00:34:41.890 --> 00:34:46.150
by Robert ducks. All right.
Fantastic. This has been another

714
00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:49.180
episode of Hanselminutes and we'll
see you again next week.
