00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.630
and technologist Scott Hanselman. This

the best way to get
started making your own video

12
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.860
game. Hi, this is Scott
Hanselman. This is another episode

13
00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.190
of Hansel minutes today. I'm
talking about getting started making

14
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.070
video games when we've got
on the phone here, Chris

15
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.680
Rose. Hi, how are you?
Hey, I'm great. How are

16
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.140
you? I'm very excited. Very
excited to talk to you.

17
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.650
You've been involved in production
on games like final fantasy,

18
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.380
14, and a lot of
different games of the different

19
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.350
genres. You've made little games
and big games you've been

20
00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.660
involved in publishing and production
worldwide. Yeah, well, mostly Europe

21
00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.800
wide. I've moved around. Yes.
I've moved around from Germany

22
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.290
to London, back to Germany
and soon Sweden. Yeah. All

23
00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.500
right. That's exciting. So one
of the things that I

24
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.300
wanted to talk about was
I realized that in 25

25
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.390
years of software development, I
don't think I've ever actually

26
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.390
made a video game. Like
I play them and I've

27
00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.280
written a lot of software.
So before we started talking,

28
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.220
I was thinking to myself,
why haven't I made a

29
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.380
video game? And I think
it's because I perceive the

30
00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.090
barrier to entry as being
very high Interesting, and not

31
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.520
even at a hackathon are
so not even there a

32
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.070
little. I think I, I
thought that it would be

33
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.740
a big deal and I
thought that there's no value

34
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.170
in my little game. And
that working on a video

35
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.600
game would be an 18
month long process with a

36
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.240
team of artists and designers.
And it would be like,

37
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.980
would it consume my life?
Well, I think it always

38
00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.330
depends on the definition of
what a game is. I

39
00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.020
know that the most commonly
known will be big triple

40
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.040
a titles on the big
console or PC even, but

41
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.920
they're also a lot of
smaller games that have gained

42
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.720
huge international recognition or earnings
best example would be flat

43
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.160
paper that for a while
made like I dunno, $50,000

44
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.670
in advertisement per day. And
if you look at it,

45
00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.080
it's not a huge or
complex game or another thing

46
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.230
which very much can be
debatable. If it's a game

47
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.810
called Cal clicker, a Facebook
thing, it was gamified. You

48
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.640
could click on a cow
and then it would move.

49
00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:18.100
It was developed by a
guy called Ian Bogost and

50
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.950
it also made some great
earnings for a while, but

51
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.610
it was supposed to be
some kind of art project,

52
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.270
but with a gamification since.
And the cool thing is

53
00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:32.170
you can get a game
around very, very quickly as

54
00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.930
the many game hackathons prove
This this weekend. I think

55
00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.720
that there is a global
game jam. Isn't that right?

56
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.580
They're trying to make a
game and just a weekend

57
00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.800
Exactly. Every year, the entire
game development community, all over

58
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.190
the world, regardless of what
your professional or your expertise

59
00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.310
is, it comes together and
creates a game for one

60
00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.270
theme, which will be revealed
like within each time zone

61
00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.270
and is kept secret and
the other time zones until

62
00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:05.190
then. And yeah, sometimes people
come as a team. Sometimes

63
00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.190
they find themselves as a
team on some games have

64
00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.670
made their way to Xbox.
I think like one was

65
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.510
called fru where he played
with connect and interact. Like

66
00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.830
your shadow will unveil platforms
or hide platforms and with

67
00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:21.630
a control, you have to
jump on them. So it

68
00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.770
was a fun, little combination
of moving around, being very

69
00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.000
active or a as well
as, you know, keeping the

70
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.700
controller in mind. What, what
kind of theme? What's an

71
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.520
example of a past theme.
It was just like zombies

72
00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.510
or platforms or Mario things.
Oh dear God. It's I

73
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:43.140
think one was the world.
Not as they see it,

74
00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.150
but as I see it
or something like that, So

75
00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.790
it's very open ended. Like
how you interpret them. Yes.

76
00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.940
I probably got the theme
wrong, but it's very much

77
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.940
down to interpretation for the
global game jam. But for

78
00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.820
others it can be something
like a word. It can

79
00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.990
be something like pick any
word from today's newspapers, front

80
00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.130
page. It's really just a
thing to get you started

81
00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.910
because when you have everything
open-ended and you have nothing

82
00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.370
to go with, then usually
you have either no idea

83
00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.850
or way too many. Ah,
okay. So the theme tries

84
00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.100
to narrow things down and
give you a general direction

85
00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.040
to go in to get
you started. And is this

86
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.890
something that the listeners like
if you're listening now and

87
00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:25.470
you've never made a game,
this is the weekend, this

88
00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.800
is a great time clear
schedule get involved and there's

89
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.450
no, you don't need to
be a part of a

90
00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.570
club or anything to do
this. Totally. And I mean,

91
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.010
they do ask you to
submit your project and to

92
00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:40.980
submit your game to the
website and everyone will do,

93
00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.980
but Hey, even if you
just want to participate on

94
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.800
the sidelines, like you make
your little project just to

95
00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.820
get a feel for it.
Why not? I don't think

96
00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:54.480
it's great when you abide
the rules and everything, but

97
00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.090
if it's your first project,
then I think it's nice

98
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.370
play in practice on the
sidelines as well. However, if

99
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:04.610
you're like really brave and
convinced that your game is

100
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.100
the next big hit, then
sure. Go ahead. Submit it.

101
00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:09.760
I like the examples of
some of the games you

102
00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.070
gave that aren't that complicated.
Like flappy bird. I mean,

103
00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:14.380
ultimately it's just one, the
one touch. And I think

104
00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:17.650
that when, when tablets began
and iPads and iPhones started

105
00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:21.040
out, I don't think we
thought that one could make

106
00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.610
a compelling or interesting game
with just one finger. But

107
00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:27.880
then I'm looking at my,
my own personal games section

108
00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:30.010
of my phone here. And
I'm realizing that most of

109
00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:32.290
them are one finger type
games. Like, you know, angry

110
00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:36.490
birds is very pretty and
very, it's a whole universe.

111
00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.280
It's a whole worldwide phenomenon,
but it's not a very

112
00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.950
complicated game mechanic, right? I
mean, you're throwing rocks at

113
00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:45.370
other objects and physics takes
over Very true. And I

114
00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:48.850
mean the, well, if you
can call it philosophy, but

115
00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:53.140
the idea behind the flappy
bird creator's approach to creating

116
00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:57.490
games is to only have
them work with one finger

117
00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:00.670
or have them operated with
one finger, because assume you

118
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:03.700
are in a bus in
a very busy bus and

119
00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:06.820
you only half, yeah. Have
a place to stand. You

120
00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:09.670
have to hold onto a
handrail. So you only have

121
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:11.770
that one hand with one
finger and you still want

122
00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:14.620
to play a game. And
they were a great pastime.

123
00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.110
And usually they're the most
successful on the app stores

124
00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:23.680
with quake revenue, high replayability
is even over a longer

125
00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.110
periods of time if you
get the social features, right.

126
00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:32.170
And even more later, there've
been very abstract games like,

127
00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:35.770
you know, circles and nines
and these kinds of games

128
00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:38.590
where it's either just numbers
on a grid or a

129
00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:43.060
geometric shapes, you know, moving
through space. And these will

130
00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:45.970
be at the top of
the charts. Yeah. Or even

131
00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:49.510
other games that like think
around the corner, so to

132
00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:52.960
speak like monument Valley, or
I think that was on

133
00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:56.680
the PSVT echo crime where
you have to tilt the

134
00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:00.100
camera in a way that
the path lines up to

135
00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:04.630
create a path. I find
that really interesting. I have

136
00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:06.490
to admit, I have been
a very big fan of

137
00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:13.390
threes where you have to
match up numbers. And the

138
00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:16.120
thing is, I know that
game has been released on

139
00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:19.270
Xbox and it is still
a nice pastime, but if

140
00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:23.500
I play threes, then usually
no, actually always on my

141
00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:27.520
phone because it feels like
it's, it has been designed

142
00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:31.360
for our phone. It just
doesn't feel as right on

143
00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:35.380
the console because trying to
emulate or simulate touch controls

144
00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:38.920
on a console is just
as difficult as trying to

145
00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:42.910
emulate a directional pads and
everything else on a mobile

146
00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:46.660
phone. Yep. I tried, I
tried very hard to play

147
00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:49.510
threes on the Xbox and
it's almost like the same

148
00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:52.990
thing with Bejeweled tight. There's
the Juul for Xbox and

149
00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:55.980
it's just, it's obnoxious because
you're moving the around when

150
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.920
you just want to touch
the giant screen, but it

151
00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:03.390
has the achievements. It does
have achievements. My, my wife

152
00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:07.380
got that 2048, which is
like a three's cologne. And

153
00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.660
what I found really interesting
about it is again, very

154
00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:13.110
simple game mechanic. She refused
to stop playing until she

155
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:15.960
got 20, 48. And this
went on for months. She

156
00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:18.780
got her 20, 48. She
took a screenshot and then

157
00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:21.870
she's done. She just walks
around with that screenshot. So

158
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:23.910
if whatever comes up again,
she has that ready to

159
00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:26.910
go and say, Nope, I
won that, that game is

160
00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:33.380
now dead to me. Excellent.
I don't usually I'm like

161
00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:37.640
that with achievements. Yeah. I'm
a bit of a completist

162
00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:41.960
myself as well. <inaudible>, There's
a, there's a whole host

163
00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.660
of game types. There's also
a host of game mechanics.

164
00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:47.450
You mentioned AAA games that
got me thinking about first

165
00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:50.600
person shooters in 3d. That
seems like a really hard

166
00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:53.150
thing to get into. If
I'm getting into making games,

167
00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:56.480
should I start with like
a Mario type game or

168
00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:59.930
should I just do text
based games? It really depends

169
00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:03.500
on what your background is.
For example, I have worked

170
00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:08.090
with many teenagers, especially female
teenagers, because we've got this

171
00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:12.800
thing called girl state in
Germany where a one day,

172
00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:17.120
every year girls around 14
years old are encouraged to

173
00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:21.830
learn about technical jobs and
companies. And I got to

174
00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:24.470
talk to a lot of
them during one of those

175
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:27.830
events and realized that most
of them are very much

176
00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:33.830
into making music, writing stories,
creating artwork, and almost none

177
00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:37.220
of them were aware that
they could use that skill

178
00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:41.360
in game development as well.
So you can, for example,

179
00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:45.170
start with text-based adventures and
it doesn't have to be

180
00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:49.010
a sole so-called mud. I
don't know if that's still

181
00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:54.740
a thing like the text
based multi-user Dungeons. I used

182
00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:57.920
to play them on Telnet.
Yeah. I think we've dated

183
00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:06.470
ourselves there Maybe, but there
is a tool called twine

184
00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:11.240
and you can find it
on <inaudible> dot org and

185
00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:15.920
there you create HTML by
spaced text adventurous. You can

186
00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:19.430
create different choices and depending
on how much you want

187
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:23.480
to get into JavaScript, or
even just HTML, you can

188
00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:29.780
change the appearance. You can
also add actual functionality to

189
00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:32.990
it. So you can make
a real text-based RPG with

190
00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:38.150
random functions with like an
item inventory, et cetera. So

191
00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:41.840
that's a great starting point
to learn how to code

192
00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:45.080
as well for web apps
even. So you get your

193
00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:48.860
first touch points with HTML
and JavaScript, and then you

194
00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:53.440
use it for other applications
you can use for tools

195
00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:58.120
like RPG maker or GameMaker
to focus on the story.

196
00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:02.140
And if you want to
look at things like a

197
00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:07.360
unity, then you will find
something called an asset store

198
00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:11.560
and in the asset store,
which GameMaker also has you

199
00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:15.430
find the work of other
people who will share their

200
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:17.320
work with you. So you
don't have to be an

201
00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:20.020
expert at drawing or an
expert at coding, but you

202
00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:22.390
just can click together the
games that you would like.

203
00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:24.880
And it doesn't matter what
kind of game you want

204
00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:27.520
to make. It can be
a puzzle game. So the

205
00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:32.830
unity course that I created
was a flappy bird clone.

206
00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:39.070
I also did a C-sharp
course with a whack-a-mole type

207
00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:44.170
game. It could be a
memory type game. It's really

208
00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:50.650
just adding a visual layer
to yeah. Programming problem. So

209
00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:54.290
to speak and finding a
solution for that. Yeah. I'm

210
00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:56.430
starting to realize that the
barrier is a lot lower

211
00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:59.190
than I thought I saw.
I was playing recently with

212
00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:03.330
an Oculus rift development kit
and someone had made a

213
00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:06.360
game, which was basically fly
helicopter and try to land

214
00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:08.760
it. And I thought to
myself, Oh my goodness, that

215
00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:11.040
must've been incredibly difficult for
them to make it turns

216
00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.840
out. They went into unity,
made it kind of a

217
00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:17.400
default 3d type game, went
and bought like a $5

218
00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:20.430
model of a helicopter. So
the person didn't even have

219
00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:22.560
to make the helicopter. And
what was cool about it

220
00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:25.320
was that this particular model
had a very detailed dashboard.

221
00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:28.860
So the individual put the
camera in the seat of

222
00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:31.770
the helicopter, which was an
unusual, that was the, that

223
00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:34.800
was the little spark of
creativity rather than being on

224
00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.480
the outside of the helicopter.
They went on the inside

225
00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:39.630
and then, you know, weekend
later you had a first

226
00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:45.480
person, virtual reality, 3d helicopter
simulator. And you know, it

227
00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:50.040
was very well received. It
was really more plugging Lego

228
00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:53.700
pieces together than it was
development. Yeah, It is. I

229
00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:56.610
mean, you have to code
a little, I think it

230
00:13:56.610 --> 00:13:58.800
would be wrong to say,
especially with unity that you

231
00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:02.040
just go ahead and create
good games without writing a

232
00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:06.000
single line of code, of
course, but it's not as

233
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.970
much as writing something natively.
I think if you wanted

234
00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:11.760
to get into C plus
plus and direct X development,

235
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.610
that will be a lot
more frustrating as a starting

236
00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:17.940
experience, then getting started with
unity and just having to

237
00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:24.030
create some special scripts. You
can afterwards dabble with C

238
00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:25.860
plus plus and direct X.
Like if you want to

239
00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:29.130
get into triple a development,
like the halos of the

240
00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:32.580
world, then we would be
very advisable, but let's face

241
00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:36.510
it. Most of the games
are now being released on

242
00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:40.440
mobile because threshold is just
so low, like for getting

243
00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:44.640
it out there, which I
find really nice. It's sometimes

244
00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:47.430
hard to stand out, but
good games still will stand

245
00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:52.100
out. And interestingly, good games
will sometimes sit around for

246
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:55.330
a year and then be
discovered Yes. By someone who

247
00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:59.860
will just rant on Twitter
or so. Yeah, very true.

248
00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.060
Hey folks, I wanted to
take a moment to tell

249
00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:08.050
you about Reagan and their
new product called pulse. Reagan

user insights. Lets you understand

253
00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:21.670
exactly what's happening when users
interact with your software. So

254
00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:25.180
you're never left guessing. Reagan
provides you with the answers

255
00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:28.990
to your performance questions and
they've found over 10 billion that's

256
00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:32.080
billion with a B bugs
and customer apps with their

257
00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:35.740
crash reporting product. And now
Reagan will help you understand

258
00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:40.090
application quality. Like no one
else over 30,000 developers worldwide,

259
00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:42.490

immediately try Reagan for free

263
00:15:51.700 --> 00:16:00.010
today@reagan.io. Yeah. A buddy of
mine took the app a

264
00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:03.190
dark room, which is, have
you ever played that game?

265
00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:08.050
A dark room? Is it
as a text adventure and

266
00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:10.810
a it's a minimalist and
you basically, Is it a

267
00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:13.060
web game or is it
an app? So it started

268
00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:15.400
as a web game and
it says a dark room,

269
00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:17.500
light fire, and there's a
single button and then you

270
00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:20.920
press light fire and then
you stoke the fire and

271
00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:24.130
then you make a, you
know, you make a, you

272
00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:26.530
make your team and you
have a hut and you

273
00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:32.080
build sticks and it's all
done entirely, entirely in text.

274
00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:36.160
It's about the most minimalist
game ever, but a mirror

275
00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:39.070
went and took this and
ported it over to iPhone.

276
00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:40.960
And it was the top
of the iPhone charts for

277
00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:44.170
like a year. Oh wow.
Because I was once at

278
00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:47.100
a hackathon in Berlin where
we had two people who

279
00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:50.350
are actually from London and
they created a text adventure,

280
00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:55.180
which sounded very similar on
that weekend. And they spent

281
00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:58.360
all night recording all the
sound bits for that. And

282
00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:01.300
that was actually made in
twine for example, which is

283
00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:05.140
why I was slightly surprised
right now. I was like

284
00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:08.710
a nice reminder, but you
know what mean, you know,

285
00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:12.280
what's really cool. I got
the chance to work with

286
00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:16.330
the newer connect, like the
V2, but you can now

287
00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:19.270
use the X books version
with an adapter for a

288
00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:23.650
PC and you can do
two things with that. You

289
00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:27.460
can either scan your own
objects. Like if you're really

290
00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:29.890
into handcraft, then you can
scan them in 3d and

291
00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:32.200
put them out into your
game. And the other thing

292
00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:35.110
is that you can record
your own animation so you

293
00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:40.210
can make your game really
personal without knowing without any

294
00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:44.890
knowledge of how to animate
an object in the computer,

295
00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:49.000
so to speak. So I
wouldn't know how to create

296
00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:52.890
an animation from scratch, just
using software tools. But with

297
00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:55.890
that within five minutes I
had a walking away having

298
00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:59.160
a jumping animation just like
that. And that's also perfect

299
00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:02.240
to get started. What was
the tool that was connecting

300
00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:04.700
to the connect that would,
that would take that image

301
00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:08.660
and turn it into an
animation. The suffer plug is

302
00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:12.560
a plugin for unity and
it's called cinema mocap, Cinema

303
00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:18.950
mocha as in motion capture.
Yes. Very cool. The, the,

304
00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:23.060
the point you made earlier
about unity and having to

305
00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:24.710
write a little bit of
code when you made that

306
00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:28.880
flappy bird lab. I remember
I had my kids run

307
00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:31.490
through a lab. My kids
are eight and 10 and

308
00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:33.290
they were able in about
an hour and a half,

309
00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:36.590
two hours with help with
it was Stacy Malkay. He

310
00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:40.370
was leading a, an event
and all these kids were

311
00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:41.900
learning how to do this.
I think we wrote maybe

312
00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:46.310
25 lines of code Very
little. I mean, after all,

313
00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:50.000
you just have to move.
Like you have to move

314
00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:54.980
either the obstacles or the
Berg, depending on what you

315
00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:57.320
want, where you want to
have it around. That's like

316
00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:02.720
two or three lines. Dunno.
Then you have to make

317
00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:06.350
it react to the tap
and make a jump and

318
00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:10.850
maybe declare some variables for
the dump height as well.

319
00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:14.600
And then you need to
define what happens in terms

320
00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:20.510
of obstacle generation as well
as collision. So those four

321
00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:23.450
things and the moving part,
like the reacting to the

322
00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:28.010
tap, I think that comes
with one of the predefined

323
00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:30.230
assets. But the thing with
that I don't like with

324
00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:34.550
predefined assets is that they
usually overloaded. They're not in

325
00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:38.900
the programming term overloading, but
rather there's too much, too

326
00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:41.210
much that you don't need.
Oh, they come with a

327
00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:44.720
lot of defaults that are
Yes, a lot of functionality

328
00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:47.420
that is necessary. And if
you change one thing or

329
00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:49.220
if you want to change
one thing, then sometimes it

330
00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:53.300
may be hard to find
it. Ah, interesting. The, the

331
00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:54.890
one thing that I was
impressed about because this was

332
00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:57.410
my first time using unity
was going through this lab

333
00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:00.440
with my kids was I
assume there'd be a lot

334
00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:03.140
of math and sideways co-sign
and this and that. And

335
00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:05.570
I'd have to teach an
eight year old about physics

336
00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:08.540
and the gravity of the
thing you had to have

337
00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:11.450
the bird fall to the
ground. I thought it was

338
00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:14.360
going to be a problem.
But that physics engine, at

339
00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:16.730
least in the context of
a 2d physics engine was

340
00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:18.860
just an asset. It was
built in like it was

341
00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:21.260
a solved, like the idea
that the physics and the

342
00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:26.240
game, our assault problem brought
me mentally into 2015. Because

343
00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:28.610
the last time I thought
about game development was in

344
00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:32.270
the mid nineties, early nineties,
where, you know, you were,

345
00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:34.220
we were moving pixels around
one at a time and

346
00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:35.780
there was no such thing
as a physics engine. You

347
00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:38.360
know, John Carmack was just
thinking about that stuff at

348
00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:40.790
that point. Yeah. And I
mean, it's not just an

349
00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:46.370
today, it's also in 3d,
also collision detection. Normally I'd

350
00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:51.580
say it's the easiest thing
to handle, but in unity,

351
00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:55.870
for example, you just set
an element, a component that's

352
00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:59.290
called called Collider. And they
can have different shapes, either

353
00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:03.460
standard shapes, like circle or
a sphere or a box

354
00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:07.030
or whatever, or you can
create your own mash gliders

355
00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:14.170
or polygon colliders for more
yeah. Custom shapes. And then

356
00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:16.840
the only thing you need
to do is you need

357
00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:20.290
to access the event collision
or the collision event. Sorry.

358
00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:24.910
And that's the only thing.
So you call up void

359
00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:28.690
on collision, enter something. And
then in there you just

360
00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:32.710
define what will happen. And
ideally you also quickly check

361
00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:36.760
what the thing has been
colliding with because otherwise you

362
00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:38.980
will step on the ground
and you will destroy the

363
00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:45.750
earth. I wonder why I
still see in 2015, 2016.

364
00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:48.030
And actually I just realized,
as I said, 2015 to

365
00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:53.070
2016, why collision detection? Isn't
it gets still hard. Sometimes

366
00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:55.380
I see like, I'll play
a game and I'll like,

367
00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:57.930
go through a wall. I'm
like really, you know, we

368
00:21:57.930 --> 00:21:59.970
used to see that early
on where, you know, the

369
00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:02.160
arm of the character would
go through the wall. And

370
00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:04.530
I wonder why people don't
use, you know, the crisis

371
00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:06.930
engine or unreal engine and
they still insist on doing

372
00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:11.070
it themselves. Well, there's various
things to keep in mind.

373
00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:14.040
Like for example, if you
have a complex object, then

374
00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:19.080
you may have to create
a complex collision yeah. Field.

375
00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:23.730
And for the sake of
saving performance, you may just

376
00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:26.940
cover the Cory body, but
not the arms for example.

377
00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:30.690
And the other thing is
the collision detection speeds. Like

378
00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:35.010
I was trying to create
a now football soccer wall

379
00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:39.990
game controlled by the connect.
If I control it with

380
00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:42.330
a mouse or with a
keyboard, everything was fine. But

381
00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:45.060
if I wanted to control
it with the connect, then

382
00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:47.760
I would shoot very quickly.
And that was too fast

383
00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:50.010
for the computer. And I'm
not that good at football.

384
00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:52.260
It was just that the
frames per second weren't enough.

385
00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:56.310
And that can sometimes be
a problem as well. And

386
00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:59.820
just a matter of glitches.
So when you're getting into

387
00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:01.860
like the AAA type stuff,
this is where we hear

388
00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:04.560
about things like, you know,
on the PlayStation, they have

389
00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:08.280
X number of CPU and
one is dedicated just to

390
00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:11.340
this aspect of the game.
And sometimes I'll hear that,

391
00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:14.010
like for example, on the
Xbox, you can hit the

392
00:23:14.010 --> 00:23:16.350
home button and it takes
you home, but you can

393
00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:19.650
disable that and get an
extra 3% of CPU back

394
00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:24.360
or something and game designers
need that. So Yes, unfortunately

395
00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:27.180
I don't know a few
like how much you play

396
00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:30.120
on your phone and how
complicated the games are or

397
00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:34.380
how demanding performance wise they
are. Unfortunately, I think that

398
00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:37.110
the better the devices get
the sloppier, the coding gets.

399
00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:44.670
So things like keeping track
off the disc space, tricking

400
00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:49.760
keeping track of memory, keeping
track of CPU, load, or

401
00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:54.410
battery drain, essentially for mobile
devices is something that we

402
00:23:54.500 --> 00:24:00.440
do not do a lot.
And some friends at Intel

403
00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:04.490
gave a talk recently on
how to optimize for battery

404
00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:07.040
life. And those were really
simple things like, yeah, you

405
00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:09.770
don't need 60 frames per
second on the main screen

406
00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:15.650
where nothing moves, stuff like
that, which I find important

407
00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:19.190
because I've got a phone
and if I play like

408
00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:21.470
it's an endless runner that
I'm playing at the moment

409
00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:26.450
just to get the achievements,
then the battery will be

410
00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:31.760
drained within two hours max.
And that's appalling, I think.

411
00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:34.990
Yeah. So you got stuck
inside of a deep, hard

412
00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:39.880
for loop and there's no
building. Yeah. So, yeah. And

413
00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:45.040
that is unfortunately the case
with hardware that gets better.

414
00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:46.990
And I think it would
be nice to also learn

415
00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:50.830
about how to become more
efficient, but it's not necessarily

416
00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:55.540
something to get started with
my next question, but what

417
00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:58.480
I find impressive. Do you
remember the demo scene from

418
00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:02.170
way back when Yes. Demo
scenes people in demo scenes

419
00:25:02.170 --> 00:25:03.790
would say, well, what can
I do on a Commodore

420
00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:07.870
64 in just 12 K
it gives some ridiculous constraints

421
00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:09.580
and then they'll go and
create an entire three D

422
00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:12.880
world with marbles and Ray
tracing in 12 K. And

423
00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:16.180
here I am on, on
a 16 gig machine with

424
00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:18.700
a 700 series Nvidia. And
I'm told that is not

425
00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:24.550
powerful enough for VR. Yes.
I've found what they created.

426
00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:29.470
Very admirable, be it, the
music, be it, the procedural

427
00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:32.560
graphics creation, et cetera, be
it in 12 K or

428
00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:35.830
even in 4k or the
bigger ones, the bigger they

429
00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:39.400
got, the more impressive they
got. But if you kept

430
00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:42.100
in mind that some of
them only were at 4k

431
00:25:42.130 --> 00:25:45.280
and looked at the results,
dear God, and they're still

432
00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:47.920
around, I think they're great
people to meet as well.

433
00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:50.890
And they also have some
user group meetups, for example.

434
00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:54.490
Yeah. I think that I
actually, I had a gentleman

435
00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:58.210
on from ocean software recently
who worked on some of

436
00:25:58.210 --> 00:26:02.140
the early music, you know,
the Sid based music and

437
00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:07.840
he was hand coding music
and you know, like, and

438
00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:10.150
I kind of like, you
know, kind of shook my

439
00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:12.010
fist in the air, like
the old man that I

440
00:26:12.010 --> 00:26:13.600
am. And I'm like, that's
how we should do it.

441
00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:15.940
We should hand code our
music. You know, it got

442
00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:17.800
me thinking about the coder
scene. Like back when computers

443
00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:21.850
were hard and I have
a bit of a mixed

444
00:26:21.850 --> 00:26:25.540
feelings about the game maker,
drag and drop, you know,

445
00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:28.780
unity where it's like, it's
great and it's amazing, but

446
00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:31.480
I dunno, it should also,
it should be, there should

447
00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:34.240
be some difficulty. So I
want to get people involved.

448
00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:36.010
But at the same time,
I miss those, you know,

449
00:26:36.010 --> 00:26:38.200
back 30 years ago when
it was difficult, There is

450
00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:43.090
one major issue with handwriting
are in natively, coding, everything.

451
00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:45.450
I mean, when you look
at your circle of friends

452
00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:53.040
and especially outside of the
Microsoft realm, I'd say the

453
00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:55.830
types of hardware that is
being used is very, very

454
00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:58.950
mixed. It also depends on
where I go. Sometimes it's

455
00:26:59.010 --> 00:27:01.320
a lot of iPhone. Sometimes
it's a lot of Android

456
00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:03.960
phones and sometimes it's a
lot of windows phones. And

457
00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:06.150
even in my circle of
friends, it's very mixed as

458
00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:10.140
well. So just coding for
one system would limit you

459
00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:13.140
from the majority of the
market. And even if you

460
00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:15.540
wanted to have your friends
to try out your game,

461
00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:18.960
it would be difficult already.
And those tools like unity

462
00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:21.930
game maker, or even unreal
help you to get it

463
00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:25.500
out on different platforms with
minimal effort. So you can

464
00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:29.700
concentrate on the game rather
than, you know, getting everything

465
00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:32.330
else to work. Yeah. That
is a really, really good

466
00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:36.440
point. I think it, it
is easy to dismiss the

467
00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:38.690
benefits. It's not just, Oh,
I didn't have to do

468
00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:40.760
a physics engine, but Oh,
I didn't even have to

469
00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:44.660
think about anything other than
screen size and touch was

470
00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:47.210
handled for me and all
that kind of stuff. However,

471
00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:51.800
I think for getting started
with coding, it's good to

472
00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:55.730
also look at just creating
one or two games natively

473
00:27:56.090 --> 00:27:59.960
for PC. Like just, just
use it and to try

474
00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:02.120
to make it once to
get an idea of what

475
00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:04.520
else is involved. It doesn't
have to be a complicated,

476
00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:09.170
came, just make a memory
game or so, and then

477
00:28:09.170 --> 00:28:12.650
you can apply that knowledge
back in the engine. But

478
00:28:12.650 --> 00:28:17.690
I would advise against using
very exotic languages. I know

479
00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:21.980
that there's some how to
make a game courses in

480
00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:27.950
various exotic programming languages or
scripting languages, if you want

481
00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:32.540
people or your kids to
get interested in creating a

482
00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:36.380
game and finding other people
to create them with, it's

483
00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:39.590
good to have them use
tools and languages that are

484
00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:44.780
widely used also to find
answers to problems or questions

485
00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:49.430
on stack overflow, right? I'm
thinking about how after this

486
00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:52.310
podcast, I'm going to get
my kids making a game.

487
00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:54.590
And I'm thinking that of
all the things you've mentioned

488
00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:57.500
for a young person, a
very young person or a

489
00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:00.710
middle schooler as we would
call them that the winery

490
00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:04.340
TWI N E R Y
winery.org is a really great

491
00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:06.020
opportunity. Cause I want them
to learn how to write,

492
00:29:06.530 --> 00:29:08.210
but it really, it gets
it to the essence of

493
00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:10.850
the game mechanic. And in
this case, it's a tech

494
00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:14.720
space, you know, go left,
go North, get your things.

495
00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:18.140
It was like a very
simple, a simple system and

496
00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:22.220
it doesn't require me to
teach them HTML. Yeah. And

497
00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:23.900
they're, I mean, there are
a lot of great tools.

498
00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:26.390
Like I remember a couple
of years ago we had

499
00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:29.690
a bar camp that we
organized in Berlin and our

500
00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:32.570
main speaker was just 11
years old at the time.

501
00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:36.470
And he talked to the
audience that was com made

502
00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:40.010
up of mostly adults. How
to create a game with

503
00:29:40.010 --> 00:29:44.500
Kodu. Now, I guess we
would prefer project spark. So

504
00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:48.640
that's a great way of
learning how, you know, game

505
00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:52.150
loops work, how to check
for things, but they have

506
00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:55.810
certain limitations in creating actual
finished games that he can

507
00:29:55.840 --> 00:30:00.010
put out on different platforms.
So I think I would

508
00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:04.420
use a mixture of twine,
maybe project spark and then

509
00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:08.020
little by little get into
GameMaker or unity, depending on

510
00:30:08.170 --> 00:30:13.210
whether they feel more comfortable
with web languages or something

511
00:30:13.210 --> 00:30:17.940
like C-sharp. Yeah. Kodu for
folks who didn't understand how

512
00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:21.270
to spell that as K
O D U Kodu game,

513
00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:23.640
lab.com. I'll put all of
this in that, in the

514
00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:26.490
show notes project spark is
pretty interesting. I've been playing

515
00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:30.750
that on my Xbox one,
but I have found though

516
00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:34.470
that it's almost, It's almost
too easy To make a

517
00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:37.620
boring and stupid game, but
the amount of work required

518
00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:40.470
to make a really complicated
game involves rather a bit

519
00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:43.380
of understanding of their interface.
My boys were able to

520
00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:46.350
go and make a forest,
make a goblin. And then

521
00:30:46.350 --> 00:30:48.120
basically that was it. They
were done and they were

522
00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:50.750
just running around, beating up
on these other goblins. And

523
00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:52.410
then they're like, this is
great. We can make games

524
00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:55.140
like, well, no, you didn't
really do anything. You just,

525
00:30:55.410 --> 00:30:57.780
you had it, auto-generate a
forest and you put a

526
00:30:57.780 --> 00:30:59.400
bunch of goblins around and
now you're beating them up.

527
00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:03.060
But if it's a first
thing to like a first

528
00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:06.510
success, like another, at a
hackathon, we had another 11

529
00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:10.770
year old kid, a boy.
And he was using unity

530
00:31:10.770 --> 00:31:12.720
for the very first time.
And the only thing he

531
00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:17.250
did was create a turn
around with some icy patches

532
00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:19.950
on it and with a
waterfall and with trees. And

533
00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:22.140
he could run around with
a 3d character on it.

534
00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:26.430
And he was so proud
that after like a day

535
00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:29.190
and a half, he has
created that he even did

536
00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:32.370
a talk about it. Like
he presented the results itself

537
00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:35.550
in front of the entire
group. And that got him

538
00:31:35.550 --> 00:31:38.580
motivated to come to the
next hackathon and try out

539
00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:42.030
more. And you know, but
it's a great thing to

540
00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:45.210
get a feel for the
interface. I don't know. Have

541
00:31:45.210 --> 00:31:49.740
you ever used something like
Cubase, for example, like a

542
00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:55.350
really complicated or really advanced
editing tool for anything that

543
00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:59.190
really okay. Because whenever I
opened Cubase for a while

544
00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:01.860
I opened it. And so
it's a sound editing tool

545
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:08.340
and then you get overwhelmed
because the interface is so

546
00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:11.430
complicated and if you're a
newbie, it might even scare

547
00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:16.440
you. So the key thing
is the kiss principle. Keep

548
00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:19.560
it simple. Stupid. Is that
actually the last, keep it

549
00:32:19.570 --> 00:32:23.400
simple. Yeah. And then isn't
the second year. It is

550
00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:25.830
stupid. Yeah. I'm afraid. So
just keep it simple, stupid

551
00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:30.870
Anyway, but keeping it simple,
lets you focus on one

552
00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:33.420
thing at a time. I
think if you try to

553
00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:36.390
create too much, if it
tried to create the next

554
00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:39.060
halo, then you will just
get frustrated along the way

555
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:43.580
with every single step, you
will run into an issue

556
00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:46.160
into a question that you
need to solve. And then

557
00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:50.120
because you are a beginner
and you are asking an

558
00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:53.750
advanced question, people in the
farms may not be as

559
00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:57.470
friendly as you might like
them to be. I find

560
00:32:57.470 --> 00:33:02.900
that sometimes a problem with
the online community, but if

561
00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:06.980
you love playing flappy bird,
for example, or the two

562
00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:10.100
D space shooter, why not
try and program something like

563
00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:14.060
that to get started with
and then take it from

564
00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:16.970
there because with each game
that you create just can

565
00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:20.780
be a weekend game, you
will learn something new and

566
00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:23.390
you will have something new
for your library of scripts

567
00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:26.710
and plugins, so to speak.
Yeah. And I think that's

568
00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:29.770
a good reminder. It is
about that feeling of accomplishment.

569
00:33:30.370 --> 00:33:32.920
And you know, you shouldn't
judge your early work if

570
00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:34.900
you, you know, if you
accomplished something like I shouldn't

571
00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:37.180
downplay the fact that they,
they did make a bunch

572
00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:38.950
of goblins and put them
in a forest and fight

573
00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:41.980
them. But I think that's
a, that's a good reminder.

574
00:33:42.250 --> 00:33:45.160
So project spark is in
the windows 10 store it's

575
00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:50.170
on Xbox Kodu is a
coder game lab. And I'm

576
00:33:50.170 --> 00:33:52.570
going to add of course,
links to that in <inaudible>

577
00:33:52.570 --> 00:33:55.420
dot org in the, in
the show notes. Thanks so

578
00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:57.580
much for chatting with me
today, Chris, Thank you for

579
00:33:57.580 --> 00:33:59.590
having me on a show.
It was great. Fun talking

580
00:33:59.590 --> 00:34:03.160
to you. My pleasure. This
has been another episode of

581
00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:05.410
Hanselminutes and we'll see you
again next week.
