00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.510
As a software engineer, chances
are you've crossed paths with

2
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.150
Mongo DB. At some point,
whether you're building an app

3
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.400
for millions of users, or
just figuring out your side

4
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.360
hustle, it's the most popular
non-relational database. Mongo DB is

5
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.230
intuitive and incredibly easy for
development teams to use. Now

6
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.290
with Mongo DB Atlas, you
can take advantage of Mongo.

7
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.680
DB is flexible document data
model as a fully automated

8
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.180
cloud service. Mongo DB Atlas
handled all the costly database

9
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.880
operations and admin tasks that
you'd rather not spend time

10
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.680
on like security, high availability,
data recovery monitoring, and elastic

11
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:44.010
scaling. Try Mongo DB Atlas

13
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.460
Hanselman. This is another episode
Hansel minutes. And today I'm

14
00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.330
talking with Tiffany Ashley Bell, the founder
and executive director of the

15
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.210
human utility. It's a platform
to bring people together from

16
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.880
around the world, help people
in Detroit and Baltimore with

17
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.390
their water bills. And you've
helped a thousand families now.

18
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.800
Yes, that's. That's correct. That's
amazing. And what does this

19
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.370
mean? You're a Y Combinator
backed, not for profit. I

20
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.640
thought Y Combinator wanted to
make the next Facebook billionaire

21
00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.610
and, but you're a nonprofit,
right? I mean, they, they

22
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.150
want to, but they also
recognize that there's an opportunity

23
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.220
to use some of the
learnings that they've had from

24
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.870
for-profits like, you know, Dropbox
and Airbnb and others that

25
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.350
they can use to like
help nonprofits basically, especially like

26
00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.320
having like a metrics based
way of operating and that

27
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.290
kind of thing. And you
went to, you went to

28
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.930
Howard and computer science and
you worked in Ruby and

29
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.910
rails and iOS, and I
bumped into you online a

30
00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.790
long time ago, you know,
just coding and doing stuff

31
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.100
and moving your way around
the world. But then you

32
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.040
were, what's called a code
for America fellow. What does

33
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.380
that mean? And how did
you go from, you're both

34
00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.470
a programmer, but you're also
kind of politically involved. Yeah.

35
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.960
I mean, so code for
America is an organization that,

36
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.540
again, like it's funny, a
lot of things that I've

37
00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.600
done over the last probably
going on 10 years now

38
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.240
have happened a lot because
of Twitter. And so I

39
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.680
ran another startup before code
for American before the human

40
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.880
utility called pencil UN read
it online appointment scheduling, but

41
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.610
that didn't do so well.
So at a certain point

42
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.620
that needed to be shut
down. And I was looking

43
00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.460
for something else to do
basically, and code for America,

44
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.890
literally follow me on Twitter.
And it was kinda like,

45
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.740
Oh, you know, this is
kind of interesting. It's a

46
00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.590
year long fellowship basically, or
at least the way it

47
00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.230
was structured previously they've changed
their programs at this point.

48
00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.700
But the way it was
structured when I was there

49
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.770
in 2014, they took teams
of three technologists. So each

50
00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.040
team was composed. I'm a
designer, I'm a developer and

51
00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.990
a person who did user
interface And user experience research.

52
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.950
And they put these this
team into, at the time,

53
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.590
10 different cities in the
United States. And I think there

54
00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.290
may have been an international
team, but 10 different cities

55
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.840
in the United States, at least.
And your goal was to

56
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.260
go into the city and
help people in city, government

57
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.710
discovers some problem or some
problems that you could use

58
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:25.600
technology to help citizens with.
So I was with team

59
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.850
Atlanta and our team ended
up working on a couple

60
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.140
of things or a few
things. One was improving the

61
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.330
situation around what happens when
you get a ticket in

62
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.000
Atlanta for something, because the
way that it used to

63
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.040
work was that in Atlanta,
at least it still works

64
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.500
that way probably, but anytime
you get a ticket in

65
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.150
Atlanta, you have to go
to court to deal with

66
00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.100
that matter. So if you
had like a broken tail

67
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.510
light that you got a
ticket for, you had to

68
00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.000
go to court for that,
but people were missing their

69
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.420
court dates because you didn't
get your court date assignment

70
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.280
the same day that you
got the ticket. It would

71
00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.770
come up some other time.
And they literally had like

72
00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.670
city council members who had
been arrested because they had

73
00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.880
not shown up in court,
basically over small things or

74
00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.570
whatnot, Because they never knew
when to get in. Right?

75
00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.030
Like they would tell you,
but it wouldn't be consistent.

76
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.950
You'd have to go to
some website or something or

77
00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.210
call and figure out when,
so the team built something

78
00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:17.550
that would text you when
your court date was supposed

79
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:20.100
to be. Another thing we
worked on was like designing

80
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.800
a new website for the
procurement department because, you know,

81
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.560
the city of Atlanta is,
is really popular city to

82
00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.080
do business with, but they
didn't have a good way

83
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.290
of like publishing opportunities and
like giving you a sense

84
00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.510
of what they've also offered
in the past those things

85
00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.030
to do business with them
through. So we built a

86
00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.220
new website for that kind
of thing or whatnot, and

87
00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.440
that's pretty much what all
the teams did. They all

88
00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.010
went into different cities and
picked out different problems that

89
00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.220
needed, or could be helped
by some kind of like

90
00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.930
really quick cleverly implemented technology
solution to help citizens out.

91
00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.450
Just need to think about
how, of course we all

92
00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.390
want to use technology to
improve lives, to help people.

93
00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.830
But when you start poking
around in local government, you

94
00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.770
know, small scale things, some,
you know, with all due

95
00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.810
respect to all of our
hardworking people in government and

96
00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.990
local government, the solutions that
they have and the technology

97
00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.720
they have, and the gaps
can be filled by pretty

98
00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.680
straightforward bits of workflow, not,
not rocket science, we don't

99
00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.840
need machine learning to make
it easier for someone to

100
00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.660
find out, you know, when
to come and pay their,

101
00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.680
their parking. Exactly. You don't,
you mean you you're totally

102
00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.910
right. But I think one
thing that I saw during

103
00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:33.780
that stint and partially before
too, cause I'm previous experience

104
00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.780
working with a federal government
contractor, there are a lot

105
00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:40.320
of people in government period
who know how to buy

106
00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.590
and look for solutions. Like,
you know, what people like

107
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.330
listening to this podcast and
you, and I would know

108
00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:49.620
how to find. So you
get these situations where cities

109
00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:54.660
have these multimillion dollar contracts
to really large corporations that

110
00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.070
make databases when they could
be using probably something a

111
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.280
lot simpler and a lot
of different places because some

112
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.880
sales person came in convinced
a person who didn't know

113
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.800
how to buy these things,
or didn't know that they

114
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.070
can just go somewhere and
perhaps, you know, download something

115
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.380
and still get support. Because
I think a lot of

116
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:15.140
people, they want a phone
number to call. So they're

117
00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:17.900
used to like these big
enterprise companies coming in and

118
00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.960
offering all that sort of
stuff at great expense, but

119
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.200
they don't realize that it
doesn't take all these heavy

120
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.500
solutions to do simple things
for citizens. And that, that

121
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.650
lack of knowhow isn't there
in a lot of situations.

122
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.690
I mean, and that's what
I was seeing in Atlanta.

123
00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:34.400
That's what I was seeing.
You know, the work that

124
00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.560
we do with other different
cities now with the water

125
00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:39.710
project or whatnot, that expertise
just isn't there. And so

126
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:42.800
you get people kind of
being taken advantage of, and

127
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.510
that's that trickles down to
what citizens experience, The idea

128
00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:48.310
that they might be taken
for a ride when it's

129
00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:52.240
something that's straightforward or open
source or readily available could

130
00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.280
solve the problem. But then
they have to, you know,

131
00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:56.890
deal with not just the
technology issues, but the speed

132
00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:59.650
of government, as well as
procurement and things like that.

133
00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.460
It can really hamstring people.
Exactly. And I think also

134
00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:05.830
one thing that I saw
in Atlanta, not to, not

135
00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:08.950
to bad mouth them, but
just like people don't want

136
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:11.980
to get in trouble for
the things that they buy.

137
00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:14.440
Like what's the old saying,
like you never get fired

138
00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:17.680
or whatever for buying IBM,
it's that kind of sort

139
00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.800
of thinking, because everything that
you do is public. And

140
00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:24.070
so people scrutinize every decision
that you make and people

141
00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:27.430
don't want to get caught
out, having paid for something

142
00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:30.490
that didn't work, you know,
you've used, you know, 30

143
00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:32.920
K in taxpayer dollars to
pay for something that you

144
00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:36.100
didn't even need. So people
go what's safe, but that

145
00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:38.740
also translates to being expensive
in a lot of cases.

146
00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:41.320
So it's that kind of
situation. So you spent that

147
00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:45.040
time at code for America,
you're solving problems at a

148
00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.890
small scale, but then how
did you come upon the

149
00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:51.040
problem around running water in
Detroit and determined that it

150
00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:55.210
was, it was on you
and your cohorts to, Yeah,

151
00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:58.630
I mean, so the situation
with the water was just

152
00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:01.750
literally something I read about
on Twitter. Like I, at

153
00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:03.400
that time and I still
do this, like every morning

154
00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.440
when I wake up, I
spend at least an hour

155
00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:08.440
scrolling through Twitter, just reading
what people are talking about,

156
00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:11.110
news postings and stuff and
whatnot. And actually I don't

157
00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:13.420
do it as much since
our political situation has changed.

158
00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:15.580
And it's kind of depressing
the kinds of things that

159
00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:19.060
you see nowadays. But back
then I saw an article

160
00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:22.090
in the Atlantic that talked
about how a hundred thousand

161
00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:25.240
people in Detroit were about
to have to live without

162
00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.880
running water, most of them,
because they couldn't afford the

163
00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:30.490
water bills. And I thought
that was crazy because I'm

164
00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:33.220
thinking to myself, like, I'm,
I'm literally in the middle

165
00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:35.860
of my code for America
fellowship at that time. And

166
00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:39.310
I was just thinking to
myself, like, okay, I have

167
00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:42.190
been privy to a lot
of how city hall Atlanta

168
00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:43.930
works. Like we got to
walk around with the mayor

169
00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:46.180
and different stuff and whatnot.
So you see all these

170
00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:49.210
decisions being made and how
people are thinking. So it

171
00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:52.150
made me kind of wonder
when I saw that story

172
00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:55.410
where they're literally turning off
the water or people like

173
00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:57.840
I've been to people's houses,
they don't have anything. So

174
00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.940
they're not taking the money
and going shopping. They just

175
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:02.400
literally don't have it. But
it's like, what kind of

176
00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.490
decisions in city hall had
to be made where you

177
00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:09.120
determine that, you know, yes,
we have this woman who

178
00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:12.900
she's only living on social
security, 700 bucks a month.

179
00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.210
We don't care. We're still
going to turn it water

180
00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:18.000
off because she owes the
city money for the past

181
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.580
three months because of her
water bill. And it just

182
00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:22.290
made me kind of wonder,
and I thought it was

183
00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:24.990
bad. I thought it was
really, really, and I'm being

184
00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:27.510
polite by saying bad. I
thought it was really crappy

185
00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:30.390
that that was going on.
And so I tweeted about

186
00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:32.820
just seeing that. And I
just asked, you know, does

187
00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:35.430
anybody know anybody who's living
in this sort of situation?

188
00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:39.090
And it turned into, you
know, my co founder, Kristy

189
00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:41.760
Tillman, we talked about like,
you know, what can we

190
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.160
do to impact this sort
of situation? And our thing

191
00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.400
was you could go to
San Francisco in San Francisco

192
00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.650
and spend a hundred dollars
on a bad restaurant in

193
00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:52.620
a weekend. So why not
take that money and like

194
00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:56.340
find people who needed help
with their water bills. And

195
00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:58.410
so in the meantime, like
I was poking around in

196
00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:01.350
the water company site in
Detroit, and I found this

197
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:05.460
400 page PDF that had
a listing of all of

198
00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:08.430
their customers, who they could
not deliver their water bills

199
00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:11.940
to via the mail. So
for some reason they threw

200
00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:14.940
all their information in a
PDF and post it to

201
00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:16.530
the site. It's the only
thing, only thing that was

202
00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:19.890
missing was names in an
AR and for our purposes

203
00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:24.690
stories. And so we, you
know, on Heroku through GitHub

204
00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:30.210
and just using Google docs
and Google sheets and bootstrap

205
00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:33.570
taped together a website and
threw that up in a

206
00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:38.340
few hours that afternoon to
find the people who needed

207
00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:40.650
help with their water bills
and get their stories. Because

208
00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:43.590
again, that PDF had hundreds
of people, but we didn't

209
00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:46.320
know what the stories were,
but we, you know, put

210
00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:49.350
that website up and we
kind of just waited. We

211
00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:52.470
put the website up on
a Thursday and we spent

212
00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:55.920
that whole weekend like wondering,
okay, we've done this thing.

213
00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:58.170
Where are the people? But
in the meantime, we were

214
00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:00.240
tweeting about what we were
doing. So it was turning

215
00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.880
into this thing where people
were writing us saying, Hey,

216
00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:05.700
you know, we want to
give to this effort, if

217
00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:08.790
you find people who need
the help. And so it

218
00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:11.460
turned into us having the,
like, you know, the whole

219
00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:14.640
lean startup thing, having to
quickly repurpose based off what

220
00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:18.300
our, what users are doing,
retooling, the website to accommodate

221
00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:20.970
donors, and then putting a
link somewhere else saying that

222
00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:23.610
if you need help with
your bill, go here. And

223
00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:25.770
so that was a Google
form. That was just a

224
00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:29.910
really quick application that we
use to find people. And

225
00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:33.690
so someone made a posting
on Facebook and that Monday

226
00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:35.670
morning we woke up to
like 40 people who had

227
00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:39.260
applied for help. And it's
been going ever since. And

228
00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.530
these are folks who are
maybe on disability, they might

229
00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:45.140
get like one person who
was written up in national

230
00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:48.290
geographic and an article about
the human utility, which was

231
00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:53.380
originally named the Detroit water
project, had a $672 check.

232
00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:57.280
That was her monthly check,
but her rent was $600.

233
00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:00.490
So she had $72 left
at the end of the

234
00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:03.190
month. And slowly, slowly, slowly,
a little bit at a

235
00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:06.700
time, got a $500 overdue
water bill. So they came

236
00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:08.710
to her house and they
turned off the water. And

237
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:12.040
this happened to tens of
thousands of people in Detroit,

238
00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:16.000
because they've got about $90 million
in bad debt and shut

239
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.020
offs were being called in
for anyone who owed $150

240
00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:24.580
or more. And it seems
like for some people that's

241
00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:27.430
a crushingly, huge amount of
money. And for other people,

242
00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:29.920
like you said, it's a
bad meal for four in

243
00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:34.080
the Bay. Yeah, exactly. I
mean, people are, you know,

244
00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:37.950
as developers, we're used to
fairly healthy salaries depending on

245
00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:40.230
where you work and what
you do, but there are

246
00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:44.910
people that, you know, that's
their monthly salary, 700 bucks

247
00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:49.140
from social security. That's supposed
to pay for rent, food,

248
00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:55.440
transportation, clothing, you know, hygiene,
all of your basic necessities,

249
00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:59.220
including water and electricity bills.
And that mathematically just doesn't

250
00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:01.410
add up for a lot
of people. So they're doing

251
00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:03.870
things like literally, I wouldn't
say literally, but like robbing

252
00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:06.750
Peter to pay Paul where,
you know, one of the

253
00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:09.120
stories I think about from
when we first started was

254
00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:11.670
a woman who I think
her name was Marnie and

255
00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:15.570
she was, she had three
kids and she was skimping

256
00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:18.270
on her heart medication to
stretch out, you know, her

257
00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:20.670
doses. I think she was
cutting her pills in half

258
00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:24.000
or something because she was
trying to stretch out that

259
00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:26.040
to be able to have
the money, to pay her

260
00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:29.790
water bills. And that's people
all, you know, all over

261
00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:31.890
this country, actually, it's not
just a problem in Detroit.

262
00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:34.290
And Baltimore is kind of
one of these like low

263
00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:38.370
key, not well talked about
problems that people are having

264
00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:43.200
where basic water service is
not affordable. And again, people

265
00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:45.780
are doing some of the
worst things imaginable to get

266
00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:48.930
by. So you have literally,
you know, Detroit's one of,

267
00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:52.260
you know, historically the United States,
one of the greatest cities

268
00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:55.260
in this country because of
its contributions and just the

269
00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.410
people and people in general,
but you have people living

270
00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:01.530
there who are in houses
that, you know, they're nice

271
00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:04.500
houses by all accounts. They've
got infrastructure to do, you

272
00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:07.350
know, run water and whatnot.
But again, they don't have

273
00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:10.530
water. And I've talked to
people who have been living

274
00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:12.990
in their house, like I
said, with pipes and everything

275
00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:15.810
else for over a year
with no water. And they

276
00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:18.660
still they've been doing things
like using the bathroom in

277
00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:21.870
their backyards, you know, dig
a hole like they're in

278
00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:25.890
some developing country or something.
And this is the United States,

279
00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:29.250
I suppose it wealthiest country
in the world. And this

280
00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:32.400
is what people are doing.
And so again, our work

281
00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:36.810
is to use crowdfunding, to
round up the dollars that

282
00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:39.630
people need to be able
to go into the water

283
00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:44.490
company and restore dignity to
themselves in a very basic

284
00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:47.040
sense. Like if you've got
the infrastructure, you should not

285
00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:49.710
be using the bathroom in
your backyard. You should not

286
00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:52.550
be doing things like, I
mean, we had a dialysis

287
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:55.190
patient who was trying to
do things with her neighbor's

288
00:14:55.190 --> 00:15:00.530
water hose. And obviously that
was not helping some people,

289
00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:04.160
they're walking several blocks to
relatives, houses in Detroit to

290
00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:07.520
take showers every day, other
folks buying cases of water

291
00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:09.830
and whatnot. And so I'll
also, I'll say this, a

292
00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:14.030
lot of people know about
the situation in Flint with

293
00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:17.810
just the water being undrinkable,
but the situation Detroit's kind

294
00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:22.520
of related because you know,
Flint originally the deal was

295
00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:25.370
to get the water from
Detroit, but Detroit was kind

296
00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:27.620
of expensive price tag wise.
And so they tried to

297
00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:31.010
find another source and that
source was polluted. So all

298
00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:35.120
this other stuff happened and
whatnot, but again, like Flint,

299
00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:37.490
you can't drink the water
Detroit, you can drink it,

300
00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:40.970
but it's expensive. And you
know, it's just a total

301
00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:43.850
terrible situation. Even though the
all that fresh water is

302
00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:46.270
right there in Michigan, it's
pretty crazy, Right. It's come

303
00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:48.280
all the way up to
their, their, their sidewalk. And

304
00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:50.590
it just can't make it
the last, you know, 30

305
00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:53.320
yards because they haven't paid
a bill. And when you're

306
00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:56.020
living at that level, when
you're living on effectively on

307
00:15:56.020 --> 00:16:00.220
the margins financially, it can
be one month where you

308
00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:02.410
just had a lousy month,
you hurt yourself, you twisted

309
00:16:02.410 --> 00:16:04.600
your ankle or whatever. And
then suddenly you don't pay

310
00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:07.570
that bill. And then, you
know, you hit a couple

311
00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:10.090
of more months of bad
luck. Are you intending to

312
00:16:10.090 --> 00:16:13.060
pay their water bill forever?
Or are you intending to

313
00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:16.690
smooth that, that bump, that
life hiccup that caused them

314
00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:18.550
to not be able to
pay their, their water bill?

315
00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:21.580
So, no, the intention is
not for most people to

316
00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:24.670
pay their water bills forever.
We make it pretty clear

317
00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:28.180
that like you get assistance
once every 18 months, unless

318
00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:31.300
there's some really extenuating circumstances
that make it where we

319
00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:34.810
have to continue to help
you. Like one of our

320
00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:37.600
funders is GitHub and they
did a video with us

321
00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:40.960
back in the fall. We
went and talked to an

322
00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:43.960
87 year old woman named
Helen. And she, you know,

323
00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:48.580
she's 87. She's not exactly
frail, but she's 87. Like

324
00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:50.980
I wouldn't, I, I don't
want to seem terrible people

325
00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:53.380
aren't hiring 87 year olds.
And so she would have

326
00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:57.790
difficulty doing something to support
herself. I want to ask

327
00:16:57.790 --> 00:16:59.680
for her to be a
Walmart greeter or whatever. She's

328
00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:03.400
87. Exactly. And so like,
we, you know, we continue

329
00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.500
to check in on her
and we pay her bill,

330
00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:07.630
you know, every once in
a while, if her family

331
00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:10.690
can't pitch in or whatnot,
but you know, that's, that's

332
00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:12.850
a rare situation. Cause it's
not supposed to be that.

333
00:17:12.850 --> 00:17:15.880
We're like, it's like some
people like to say promoting

334
00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:18.670
dependency is just a one
time situation. Cause most people,

335
00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:21.640
like you said, you know,
you break your ankle. Some

336
00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:26.560
crazy health situation comes along.
Like, you know, some people

337
00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:28.270
like, you know, Oh, I
had to bury my mother

338
00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:29.800
and that kind of thing
or whatnot, and she didn't

339
00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:33.070
have insurance. So it drained
me, you know, and that

340
00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:35.260
kind of thing or other
situations too, it's not just

341
00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:38.740
like unfortunate situations in that
regard. Like we have a

342
00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:41.980
lot of people who work
and maybe their hours have

343
00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:45.580
been cut or, you know,
they've been laid off because

344
00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:49.980
they had something to do
with whatever remaining manufacturing is

345
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:54.500
in Detroit. And those people
downsize again. Yeah. It just

346
00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:56.930
takes their moment. It takes
a hiccup. And then you're

347
00:17:56.930 --> 00:18:00.080
like a big thank you
to our sponsors because they

348
00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:02.480
make the show possible. And
I hope that you support

349
00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:05.990
them the way they support
us progress. Software is the

350

E L E R I

363
00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:59.210
k.com/hanselman. Now that you've changed
the name from the Detroit

364
00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:01.880
water project, which people can
go and search and find

365
00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:03.830
all kinds of great articles,
four and five years ago

366
00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:06.860
about the project. Now you're
calling it, the human utility

367
00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:09.590
is the intention to stay
focused on water or other

368
00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:12.230
delinquent bills for things that
we were considered to be

369
00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:16.430
fundamental to a developed country
like electricity. No. So the

370
00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:18.860
focus is staying on water
at this point because it's

371
00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:22.400
in the United States. At least
it's the only utility that

372
00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:26.330
isn't protected in a federal
sentence. Like, so for example,

373
00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:28.520
the census does a survey
every year. I think it's

374
00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:31.100
called the American community survey
where they ask families of

375
00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:35.090
different socioeconomic backgrounds. Like have
they been able to do

376
00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:37.160
things like pay bills and
how do you get your

377
00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:39.020
kids to school and that
kind of thing or whatever.

378
00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:41.780
But they ask about, you
know, your ability to pay

379
00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:46.130
certain utilities and they break
it out by gas and

380
00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:48.800
electric. I think those two
are separate and then there's

381
00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:51.650
phone bills and there's one
other one, but water isn't

382
00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:54.470
explicitly included as a thing
that they ask you about

383
00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:56.870
affording. So the reason why,
you know, that's one of

384
00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:58.490
the things I want to
talk about changing at some

385
00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:01.280
point is because if you're
not measuring it, you're not

386
00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:04.490
fixing it. And when it
comes to that kind of

387
00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:07.700
information in a federal sense,
that's federal money. That's not

388
00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:11.330
getting appropriated for that purpose.
So that's the thing that

389
00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:15.890
that's not being solved basically.
So, you know, it's issues

390
00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:17.400
like that, but we want
to focus on water, but

391
00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:20.180
you get game because everything
else there's programs for it.

392
00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:22.670
And well actually I'll go
back and I'll say this

393
00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:25.850
like water is protected if
it's tied to heating, but

394
00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:28.160
if it's not tied to
heating, then you know, you're

395
00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:30.650
on your own basically. So
I think water needs its

396
00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:35.720
own sort of advocacy. I
noticed also when I visit

397
00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:39.200
the site, the human utility
and I say, I want

398
00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:40.840
to help, or I want
to get involved or I

399
00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:43.400
can say give monthly, in
some places I see that

400
00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:46.100
you use technologies like air
table or your, or like

401
00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:48.880
Stripe when you're building a
site like this, did you

402
00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:52.000
think to yourself, I'm going
to go and use things

403
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.860
like air table or Google
sheets. Like you said, you

404
00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:55.900
started out early on. I
see a tweet here. In

405
00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:58.300
fact, I'll put it in
the show notes from 2014,

406
00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:00.220
when you were just trying
to figure out how to

407
00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:02.710
make this thing, how much
were you thinking, you know,

408
00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:04.660
I'm going to do this
entirely custom code and write

409
00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:08.200
it from scratch and rails
versus, you know, there's no

410
00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:10.900
reason for the human utility
to build a big giant

411
00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:13.600
infrastructure when we've got all
these other great software as

412
00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:16.530
a service solutions out there.
Right? I mean, so part

413
00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:19.320
of that at the beginning,
it leaves was just, this

414
00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:22.680
was never supposed to be
like an actual longterm thing.

415
00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:24.690
We were just putting something
up in a weekend and

416
00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:27.600
if it worked out great
and if not, okay, we

417
00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:30.090
can just leave all this
stuff hanging. But, you know,

418
00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:32.940
as we kept seeing people
giving and applying for help,

419
00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:37.380
we needed to continue to
build things. So especially upon

420
00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:40.290
getting accepted to Y Combinator,
I ended up, you know,

421
00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:45.000
taking my rails development skills
and building out more of

422
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.640
the crowd funding platform. So
that's where, you know, Stripe

423
00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:52.380
comes in, we're hosted on
Amazon. <inaudible> what else is

424
00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:55.860
in there? We have Twilio
that we use for notifying

425
00:21:55.860 --> 00:22:00.060
people once they get accepted.
And as far as getting

426
00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:02.970
help, what else is there?
There's MailChimp that, you know,

427
00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:07.260
handles things like a donor
communications and whatnot. So some

428
00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:10.620
of this also building custom
stuff just came from how

429
00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:12.810
we used to work. Like
we used to do like

430
00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:15.390
a, a direct match as
far as how the money

431
00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:20.790
worked. So the system would
like is still does this

432
00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:22.830
in some ways, but like
not the way it used

433
00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:26.160
to, it was, it would
match people, you know, in

434
00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:28.530
terms of like, Hey, you
gave $5. Here's the person

435
00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:30.780
that should go to and
whatnot. So now it's more

436
00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:33.330
of a pool of funds
basically, but the way it

437
00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:35.460
used to work, it was
an explicit match. And so

438
00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:39.360
that, wasn't something that you
could buy basically. So we

439
00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:42.720
built that, you know, on
our own. And so that

440
00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:45.300
was just in there and
that's like a, a Relic.

441
00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:48.810
And plus also like, you
know, go fund me there.

442
00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:51.150
There's nothing wrong with them
as a platform, despite the

443
00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:53.760
fact that they've turned into
a healthcare platform really. But

444
00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:58.020
like there were a bunch
of other scattered sort of

445
00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:01.620
crowdfunding efforts for water bills,
but there was nothing that

446
00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:05.400
had a critical mass of
support behind it. Plus also

447
00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:07.620
you had the kind of
at that time, wait till

448
00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:10.020
your campaign got to a
certain size to withdraw the

449
00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:13.140
money. And when people come
to us, like they need

450
00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:17.040
the money ASAP basically. So
we're able to, you know,

451
00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:21.600
collect donations through Stripe. We
pay out bills pretty much

452
00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:26.370
every single day. And you
know, that works better for

453
00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:28.680
us basically. And also it
allows us again to like

454
00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:32.160
manage our own sort of
donor communications systems and that

455
00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:34.050
kind of thing. And then
also we built our own

456
00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:37.200
case management system. Cause that's
another thing that you could

457
00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:39.990
buy off the shelf, but
everything that was seeing was

458
00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:42.720
just like aggressively bad. So
like we have our own

459
00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:47.480
case management system aggressively bad.
Yeah. I mean, I have

460
00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:49.970
a thing about like ugly
software and it was all

461
00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:53.930
ugly. So it was just,
we both do our own

462
00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:56.690
thing that again sits on
top of VC too. We've

463
00:23:56.690 --> 00:24:00.470
got elastic search behind it.
So there's all these like

464
00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:04.100
different engineering technologies that are
in there that, you know,

465
00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:06.680
we use to roll into
this thing that helps people

466
00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:09.130
Well. So I see a
lot, there's a lot of

467
00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:10.840
people on the internet though,
that are looking for a

468
00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:13.810
buck, how do you make
sure that someone doesn't abuse

469
00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:16.360
your platform and make sure
that they do send people

470
00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:18.520
out to confirm that they're
who they are? How do

471
00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:22.630
you make sure they're not
using this for inappropriate use?

472
00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:25.000
Yeah. So there's a couple
of different checks that we

473
00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.430
run. So one is that
when you apply, you have

474
00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:30.250
to submit your pay stubs
to us. If you have

475
00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:34.210
some kind of income or
like your social security letters

476
00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:37.480
and that kind of thing,
you also have to send

477
00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:41.620
us your picture ID. So,
and you do that. Well,

478
00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:43.570
I will say this, your
picture ID and your also

479
00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:45.760
your lease or your deed
for your property and your

480
00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:48.310
lease. We look for things
like, are you actually responsible

481
00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:50.320
for the utility bill? Cause
a lot of cases like

482
00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:52.940
some people, their landlord was
supposed to pay the bills.

483
00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:55.060
So that's not, that's not
a situation that we handle,

484
00:24:56.170 --> 00:24:58.270
but we ask people to
submit that information and they

485
00:24:58.270 --> 00:25:01.960
do that by texting it
to us through Twilio or

486
00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:04.210
they can fax it and
we receive it through hello

487
00:25:04.210 --> 00:25:06.610
fax and it, you know,
gets in our system that

488
00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:09.190
way or whatnot. But again,
like in building our own

489
00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:13.180
case management system, that is
all custom through Twilio where

490
00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:16.150
we can text your photo
ID, it shows up on

491
00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:18.280
your profile, cause it's matched
by the phone number that

492
00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:20.740
you give on your application
and whatnot. But then we

493
00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:23.560
use all that and we
have a liaison, the water

494
00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:26.740
department that we confer with
and we, you know, say,

495
00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:31.030
you know, what's this person's
history with you all, you

496
00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:33.760
know, what do they actually,
Oh, have they told the

497
00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:36.130
truth in terms of them
being shut off and that

498
00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:38.860
kind of thing. And if
anything seems fishy, we either

499
00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:41.530
won't help or we'll delay
helping until we get more

500
00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:44.590
information about each case basically.
And we have a pretty

501
00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:47.920
thorough process for checking on
people that, you know, we've

502
00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:50.380
had some people get through
in the past, but that's

503
00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:54.100
because we didn't have as
thorough of a vetting process.

504
00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:57.100
Hmm. I like the idea
that you have, I was

505
00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:58.900
impressed that you just said
you have a liaison at

506
00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:01.480
the fire department. So you've
made a big enough move

507
00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:04.870
here that they know you.
And now when you call

508
00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:08.080
the water, the water department
knows it's y'all and can

509
00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:10.720
work with you. So then
the process then extends out

510
00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:14.230
to the, the municipal organization.
Yeah, exactly. And that's, so

511
00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:17.950
we work with at least
15 or 16 different cities,

512
00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:20.500
most of those in Michigan,
but we have a liaison,

513
00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:22.330
all of them or not
all of them, but like

514
00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:24.700
for most of them were,
if we have a problem,

515
00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:27.130
you know, and we need
some information about a case,

516
00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:29.590
you know, our customer service
person can just email them

517
00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:31.810
or call them even, and
just say, Hey, I need

518
00:26:31.810 --> 00:26:34.180
this information. Can you send
it to me? And that

519
00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:37.390
also like makes things quicker
as far as helping people.

520
00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:39.970
Cause there's no point in
like having all this like

521
00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:42.250
software that we built and
this whole like sort of

522
00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:46.080
much streamlined, somewhat streamlined process
for helping people, if people

523
00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:48.720
become the stumbling block in
the process. And so we

524
00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:50.850
did the whole liaison thing
cause I used to have

525
00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:54.420
to call Detroit and sit
on the customer service line

526
00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:59.280
for 45 minutes at a
time. And you know, even

527
00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:01.740
though we were paying a
thousand dollars worth of bills

528
00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:03.840
at a time when we
did that, but you know,

529
00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:05.970
there was no person to
call at that time, but

530
00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:08.370
I was wasting a lot
of time doing that. So

531
00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:11.670
I, you know, got on
the horn and found some

532
00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:14.310
people actually through code for
America. I got linked to

533
00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:17.100
the city of Detroit CIO
and she referred me to

534
00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:20.400
some people in the water
department that became champions for

535
00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:22.440
us and got us that
person to work with or

536
00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:25.610
whatnot. So That's really cool
because like you say, you

537
00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:28.100
write all this custom software,
you're going, you're trying to

538
00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:32.270
automate what you're trying to
scale a system. And it

539
00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:35.330
certainly, then it hits a
remote procedure call that takes

540
00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:38.540
45 minutes, which is Tiffany
gets on the phone. Why

541
00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:39.920
did I write all this
software? And now I have

542
00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:42.800
to stand on it, sit
on hold. Exactly. And so

543
00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:46.790
that's not a thing anymore,
fortunately. Great. And do you're

544
00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:49.400
paying the water company, like
to be clear people aren't

545
00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:51.380
like rolling into your offices
and they don't get a

546
00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:54.710
check, you literally pay their
bills. So the bill goes

547
00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:57.410
away for their, their issue
or their problem as opposed

548
00:27:57.410 --> 00:28:00.860
to you paying a check
personally to them. Right. Right.

549
00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:04.670
And so the way it's
designed, so we we've had

550
00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:09.080
an interesting sort of situation
as far as being how

551
00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:11.090
some of our banking is
set up. But the way

552
00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:15.290
our system is actually designed
by using something called sinaps

553
00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:19.010
pay, we were able to
just like write software again,

554
00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:21.590
that if I press a
button, I can wire money

555
00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:25.400
to Detroit or wire money
to Baltimore. But you know,

556
00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:27.320
most of the time, like
we don't engage that it

557
00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:29.240
just ends up being like
a credit card payment or

558
00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:33.350
something. Cause that's more like
for chunking bits of money.

559
00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:35.390
And then there's telling them
like, Hey, wire's coming through

560
00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:39.860
for $10,000 for these people,
but again, Oh, so you

561
00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:41.690
can send it in a
batch and say here's the

562
00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:44.270
batch. And then they can
do the accounting as opposed

563
00:28:44.270 --> 00:28:46.790
to little amounts here and
there. Yeah, Exactly, exactly. And

564
00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:48.710
so that ends up painting
like more efficient, but we

565
00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:50.870
also just, you know, if
someone comes to us, they've

566
00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:53.720
got all the information together
and the case is pretty

567
00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:55.520
easy. We can just pay
it on the fly with

568
00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:58.910
a credit card for them.
Yeah. And it's really interesting

569
00:28:58.910 --> 00:29:00.380
to read this story. As
you can go up to

570
00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:02.840
the website and check this
out. Some of the stories

571
00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:04.520
are really interesting because you
might be listening and you

572
00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:06.890
might be saying as a,
as a listener of the

573
00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:09.350
podcast, like, well, you know,
people shouldn't get in these

574
00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:11.810
situations or how did this
even happen? Why don't you

575
00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:13.820
just pay your bill? Or
you have a really interesting

576
00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:16.880
story here where a gentleman
was mailed and out standing

577
00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:19.850
water bill. He had thought
when he rented the house,

578
00:29:19.910 --> 00:29:23.150
as we've all seen before,
I've rented houses where the

579
00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:26.780
water in the sewage and
the utilities were included. It

580
00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:29.660
turns out everything was included
except water. And he didn't

581
00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:32.660
find out that the water
wasn't included until the water

582
00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:34.880
got shut off. And you
know, I've had that happen

583
00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:36.830
where I thought the cable
was included in suddenly the

584
00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:40.340
cable shuts off and it
wasn't the water, but it

585
00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:43.930
can totally happen. And then
You're on, you're retired, you're

586
00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:47.500
going to be on disability.
This gentleman had cancer and

587
00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:50.410
that you just can't spend
these can't spare the 250

588
00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:53.860
bucks to pay your water
bill. Exactly. And that happens

589
00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:56.020
every day that people, yeah.
And then when you, when

590
00:29:56.020 --> 00:30:00.160
you fix that, that hiccup,
then those monthly manageable bills

591
00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:02.740
go down to maybe a
range of $40 that someone

592
00:30:02.770 --> 00:30:06.820
potentially can, can manage. And
it all started with you

593
00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:10.150
on Twitter, apparently saying, this
is a problem. There must

594
00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:12.760
be a way to solve
this with software. Yeah, exactly.

595
00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:15.790
I mean, it's, you know,
we started off with like

596
00:30:15.790 --> 00:30:18.520
a sign of a really
dinky, ugly website. It was

597
00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:21.640
taped together with, I mean,
even the donor form to

598
00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:23.830
say how much you were
going to give was literally

599
00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:28.630
just a Pais designed with
bootstrap that was connected to

600
00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:31.780
a Google spreadsheet. And so
we just like hacked the

601
00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:35.860
variables, whatever the form variables
to send it to the

602
00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:38.530
spreadsheet. And that, that was
our database originally because we

603
00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:41.590
didn't have time. Like me
and Christie had entirely different

604
00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:45.820
jobs. We didn't have time
to like, you know, do

605
00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:48.160
all this infrastructure. At first.
We didn't even collect money

606
00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:51.160
from people originally. We just
would give you instructions on

607
00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:54.190
how to pay and you
would send us the confirmation

608
00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:55.840
number. And we would send
that to the person that

609
00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:59.560
got the help. So it
was designed to just be

610
00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:01.570
like a thing that if
it worked great, but if

611
00:31:01.570 --> 00:31:03.820
it didn't, you know, we
could just, everything would just

612
00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:07.150
go away and forget about
it. So what's so impressive

613
00:31:07.150 --> 00:31:10.330
is that you saw a
problem. You solve the problem.

614
00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:12.520
You were doing a whole
other job, a whole other

615
00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:16.840
life and fast forward five
years later, you're still doing

616
00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:19.810
it. The human utility is
grown, has hired. There's multiple

617
00:31:19.810 --> 00:31:24.250
people working with you and
you use software to make

618
00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:27.940
people's lives better. And I
really appreciate that. Thank you.

619
00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:29.920
Thank you. I didn't think
I'd be doing this five

620
00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:33.310
years later, but you know,
it's a problem. That's ongoing.

621
00:31:34.150 --> 00:31:37.000
Many millions of people have
problems affording their water bills

622
00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.790
and utility bills in general
in the United States. And it's

623
00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:41.950
the thing that needs to
keep going as long as

624
00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:45.190
we can help with folks.
So when people can follow

625
00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:55.330
you@twitterdotcomslashtiffanywithaneyeandtheycancheckoutthehumanutilityathumanutility.org. Thank you so much.
