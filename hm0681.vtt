this is Scott Hanselman. This

15
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.750
is another Hansel minutes today.
I'm talking with Allie spill.

16
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.630
She is a software developer
and developer advocate over at

17
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.690
dev, too. That's dev dot
T O. How are you?

18
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.390
I'm doing well. How are
you? I'm doing all right.

19
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.090
Thanks for chatting with me
today. I was following a

20
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.450
really cool thread that you
have going on on Twitter,

21
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.470
where you asked a bunch
of people, specifically new programmers.

22
00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.980
What were their biggest questions
about learning, how to code,

23
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.240
why are you exploring how
new developers think about learning,

24
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.680
how to code? Totally. So
for me, I started off

25
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.490
programming in a really untraditional
way. I wasn't a computer

26
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.790
science major. I started coding
a little bit older than

27
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.390
a lot of developers that
I know, and it was

28
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.640
something that was pretty difficult
for me. I ended up

29
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.590
quitting coding after taking two
computer science classes in college,

30
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.530
and I just thought that
coding wasn't for me. And

31
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.960
so I totally walked away
from it and then came

32
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.570
back to it a little
bit later. And so I

33
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.790
know that that was such
a hard process for me

34
00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:12.860
to learn how to code
and to feel accepted in

35
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.830
the developer community. So it's
something that I'm really passionate

36
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.460
about now. I ended up
teaching people how to code

37
00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.290
full time at a boot
camp for a year and

38
00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.280
a half. And now I
am still trying to teach

39
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.800
as much as I can,
even though I'm still, even

40
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.280
though I moved back to
a software engineering position And

41
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.980
you've taken a bunch of
these concepts and you've broken

42
00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.630
them down and it's kind
of cool. You I've never

43
00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.000
seen this before. It's quite
clever. You asked the question

44
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.390
on Twitter and then they
answered, and then you actually

45
00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.010
did something that I recommend
to a lot of people,

46
00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.870
rather than answering the question
on Twitter and effectively giving

47
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.590
Twitter your keystrokes for free,
you took the questions and

48
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.630
answers and put them on
your blog and then linked

49
00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.240
back to it. So every
time someone asked a question,

50
00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.670
you would say, Oh, I
answered it over here. Very

51
00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.710
clever. Yeah. Mostly Just because
Twitter is so temporary and

52
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.220
also having some place that
I can link this back

53
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.790
in the future is really
helpful. Yeah. Well it's like

54
00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.670
Twitter may go away someday,
but your blog posts will

55
00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.780
be there forever. Totally. Yeah.
One of the things that

56
00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.430
I've noticed that I know
that you've been exploring this

57
00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.010
as well is how to
break down problems and I'm

58
00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.970
trying to get my head
around. What's intuitive and what's

59
00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.940
inborn. And like what I
find intuitive might not be

60
00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.000
what someone else finds intuitive.
Do you think you were

61
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.750
born able to break problems
down, like, like quote unquote,

62
00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.320
like a coder or did
you learn that? So I

63
00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.530
think one of the biggest
problems for programmers is to

64
00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.770
be able to like teach
yourself and solve things for

65
00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:48.810
yourself. And so I was
homeschooled growing up and I

66
00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.660
think that that was actually
a really big part of

67
00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.260
how I am a strong
programmer because I had to

68
00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.520
teach myself a lot of
the skills growing up and

69
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.090
teaching myself math and teaching
myself English and all those

70
00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.180
things. And I think that
that's really translated well into

71
00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.200
programming and problem solving in
that way. So I think

72
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.340
that definitely the education system
plays a huge role into

73
00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.810
that and the different education
that people have access to

74
00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.130
is really, really huge there.
And I do think that

75
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.420
the fundamental math concepts really
play a big role into

76
00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:32.490
this. And as interesting it
is to think about like

77
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.790
most of programming or a
huge chunk of programming is

78
00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.290
basic algebra and actually teaching
people how to code. That's

79
00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.960
something that I've seen lacking
in a lot of students.

80
00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.520
And so I think that
those skills tend to come

81
00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.330
in big part from the
education system. That being said.

82
00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.020
I also think that certain
people do like breaking things

83
00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.260
apart and putting them back
together, but then other people

84
00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.220
do, I'm more interested in
having a premade solution that

85
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.040
they take, which I think
are actually both really important

86
00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.520
skills for programmers, like building
stuff yourself is really important

87
00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.370
to some extent, but then
also knowing where to go

88
00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.430
outside of yourself and find
a solution that's already been

89
00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:19.140
made for you is also
pretty important. I have this,

90
00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:22.350
this high, this conversation with
Maria on my team and

91
00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.540
I bring it up often
in podcasts because it was

92
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.780
really very clever. We were
teaching each other some techniques

93
00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.450
and it was my turn
to teach aspects of dotnet

94
00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.150
and C sharp. And I
started at a very low

95
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.290
level showing her the intermediate
language, the assembly language, that.net

96
00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.740
compiled into. And I basically
taught the way I was

97
00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:45.330
taught, which is from the
metal up. And she stopped

98
00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.190
me and said, I don't
like to learn about the

99
00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.800
metal. Like I don't, the
metal doesn't matter anymore. I'm

100
00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.900
really more interested about learning
from the glass of the

101
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.300
monitor back. And I'm like,
what do you mean by

102
00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.830
the class? And I was
like, well, you know, press

103
00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:59.480
F 12 in, in the
browser and then go backwards

104
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.430
and I'll go as far
back as I want to,

105
00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.610
until it becomes not interesting.
Right. What does she need

106
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:06.380
to know about? Yeah, it's
kind of cool. Huh. Does

107
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.900
she need to know about
CPU registers and stuff like

108
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:12.980
memory management for me meant,
you know, allocating your own

109
00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:16.280
memory and see, but memory
management today is more like

110
00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.810
JavaScript memory management, which is
very, very different. Totally. So

111
00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:23.740
I think that it can
be important for contextual knowledge,

112
00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:27.220
like knowing why you use
different data structures based off

113
00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:30.160
of memory usage and stuff
like that. Like why you'd

114
00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.430
use the link list in
certain scenarios, array and others.

115
00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:36.250
So I think that it's
helpful in that context, but

116
00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:41.170
that's actually where I left
computer sciences. I had done

117
00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:45.010
really well with the Python
and higher level programming classes

118
00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:48.130
where it's a lot of
just putting the pieces together

119
00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:50.440
and building stuff fast. But
then when I got to

120
00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.830
C plus plus and learning
about pointers and all that,

121
00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.930
it was a little bit
less relevant to me. I

122
00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:58.660
don't think I ever really
got like, why we're learning

123
00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.730
this. If we know how
to use Python, like, why

124
00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:04.030
would we use C plus
plus, but now looking back

125
00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:08.170
on it, I very much
understand that. But at that

126
00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:12.280
point I didn't have that
context to know why knowing

127
00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.890
that was important. I just
had more fun with Python.

128
00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:17.110
So I'd rather write code
with that. At that point,

129
00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:20.140
When I was growing up,
my father would not let

130
00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:23.050
me drive an automatic stick
car. He required me to

131
00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:26.200
drive a manual stick because
he was, his argument was

132
00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.860
like, well, the automatic is
fine, but it's hiding something

133
00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:31.990
from you. So you need
to learn to ride and

134
00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:33.820
drive a stick because one
day you'll need to drive

135
00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:36.700
a stick. And that actually
happened. There's been times when

136
00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:37.930
it was like, I was
the only one in the

137
00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:39.460
group that could drive a
stick and it got us

138
00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:42.640
out of weird situations, but
at the same time now,

139
00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:45.970
fast forward, now we have
like Uber and we're like,

140
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.960
how many more level? Like
there's from subways to, to

141
00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:52.060
text, to taxis, to Uber's
how, how many layers of

142
00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:54.610
abstraction have we put on
top of the manual stick

143
00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:58.300
car? So then we become
this culture where we have

144
00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:00.520
the people who can drive
stick and the people who

145
00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.310
don't even have driver's licenses.
I wonder if the same

146
00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:05.680
thing will happen in software
where we have like the,

147
00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:08.410
the no's and the no
knots or the low level

148
00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:11.650
stick shift, driving people and
the Uber driving people. And

149
00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:15.250
if that creates a caste
system. Yeah, that's really interesting.

150
00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:17.950
I mean, thinking about it.
So many people specialize in

151
00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:21.010
so many different fields, like
I know so many awesome,

152
00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:24.070
the developers that write each
team, Alan CSS, and that's

153
00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:28.450
pretty much it. And so
if you're working in mostly

154
00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:31.210
those languages, is it super,
super helpful to know about

155
00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:34.780
assembly and how binary works
and how, you know, the

156
00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:38.230
CPU is going on? Maybe
it's still helpful, but maybe

157
00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:43.060
it's more important to focus
on accessibility and how CSS

158
00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:46.610
is interpreted by the browser
and all that. So there's

159
00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:50.080
so many different niches that
you can really narrow down

160
00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:53.170
into your, or your own
and have your more important

161
00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.490
information there. So is your
advice to a new programmer

162
00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:58.890
To like, not be stressed
out about how much stuff

163
00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:00.810
there is to memorize and
just think about the fact

164
00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:02.490
that there are these niches
and you can just focus

165
00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:04.290
on the one that's interesting
to you and really not

166
00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:07.370
sweat the other stuff. Yeah.
I'm a pretty big, like

167
00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:11.090
don't memorize anything person. I
personally am not somebody with

168
00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:15.260
the best memory in the
world. I definitely focus more

169
00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.050
on being able to look
stuff up, being able to

170
00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:21.350
break down a problem, accurately,
being able to ask the

171
00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:23.810
questions that matter so that
you know, what our problem

172
00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:27.650
really is and what the
client actually wants from a

173
00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:30.710
project. I think that all
those things and working with

174
00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:33.170
the team and all that
is a lot more important

175
00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:37.070
than having anything memorized in
order to recite something back

176
00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:41.660
by memory to something. Do
you think that there's just

177
00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:44.540
so much stuff now, maybe
that there was less stuff

178
00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:48.350
in the eighties or different
stuff than a certain generations

179
00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:51.200
are expected to like learn
the whole stack. And the

180
00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.180
whole stack is so much
more to memorize that it's

181
00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:56.600
slowing people down and making
new devs like too afraid

182
00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:02.510
to jump in. Maybe I
also think that the availability

183
00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:05.840
of information right now too,
is so incredible where you

184
00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:08.240
can look pretty much anything
up and have an answer

185
00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:13.100
there in a couple seconds.
I think knowing that is

186
00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:16.040
so important, I think in
general, our education system, like

187
00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:17.930
really, it needs to move
to a point where they're

188
00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:22.640
accepting of that and classes
aren't just memorize these things

189
00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:26.540
anymore, but I guess that's
a different, different answer there.

190
00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:28.460
No, but I think that
you're, you've brought up the

191
00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:31.640
education system a couple of
times. We can't really talk

192
00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:34.280
too much about that, but
we can talk about the,

193
00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:38.540
the, let's talk about the
concept of code smell or

194
00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:41.840
just general factual smell. Like
you just made the comment

195
00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:43.610
that there's lots of stuff
online that people can go

196
00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:45.180
and find and download, you
know, but then there's a,

197
00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:47.900
there's a, there's a difference
between using the internet and

198
00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:50.240
the sum of human knowledge
to get an answer and

199
00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:53.750
then copy pasting directly from
stack overflow into production. You

200
00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:55.310
know what I mean? Like
there's, there's a fine line

201
00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:58.070
there. So I feel like
some of the new dabs

202
00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:00.920
maybe are having trouble telling
whether something is true or

203
00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:03.860
not, or whether this is
appropriate code, because it was

204
00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:05.660
the first thing on Google.
It must be the best

205
00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:08.630
way to use a link
list. Right? Yeah, definitely. So

206
00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:11.600
it's definitely overcoming that. And
instead of Googling a whole

207
00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.630
problem, Googling the parts of
the problem that you can't

208
00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:18.500
solve yourself. So instead of
searching, how do I make

209
00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:21.170
a tic TAC toe game
in JavaScript, which I know

210
00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:24.590
a lot of new developers
might do instead. It's how

211
00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:28.130
do you have a button
that you can click on

212
00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:30.710
and have some other user
interaction based off that button

213
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:34.310
click, like having the individual
pieces that you can do

214
00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:37.610
Google and find the answer
to what a string method

215
00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:40.520
is or something like that
is so important, but then

216
00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:42.890
being able to break down
that problem and solve those

217
00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:46.040
pieces individually is still so
important. And I think that's

218
00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:49.340
what programmers need to focus
on is being able to

219
00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:51.950
solve those problems, being able
to break them into pieces,

220
00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:55.090
being able to those pieces
individually. I think that's the

221
00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:57.540
really important part. Hmm. That's
a good point. And that

222
00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:00.270
gets to your point about
breaking down pieces of a

223
00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:03.450
problem into the right, the
right chunks. I wonder if,

224
00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:07.260
if you and I Google
for different stuff than the

225
00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:10.770
new people do, like maybe
they are Googling for bigger

226
00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:13.920
things of bigger scope or
bigger, full on solution type

227
00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:16.380
stuff while you and I
are looking for a syntax

228
00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:19.440
and you know, I know
what I'm doing. I just

229
00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:22.350
don't know how to hook
the button up. Totally. And

230
00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:24.390
that's why I'm kind of
ready live series that I'm

231
00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:26.490
working on right now. So
I'm working on a project

232
00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:29.700
where I'm taking a bunch
of different aspects to problem

233
00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:33.240
solving and breaking them down
for developers and showing my

234
00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:37.410
process and my advice for
how to approach these things

235
00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:42.180
and what questions to ask
and what strategies to follow

236
00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:45.060
in order to find the
right solutions to problems. And

237
00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:48.510
one of my things for
a little bit and learning

238
00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:52.230
and not for, for forever,
but maybe at some point,

239
00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:55.500
make yourself a cheat sheet
with all the syntax that

240
00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:57.870
you might need for your
language, and then turn off

241
00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:00.600
the internet for awhile and
only write code on your

242
00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:04.050
computer, not for forever, but
just for a little bit

243
00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:07.620
to you're solving these problems
by yourself, you're putting together

244
00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:11.550
the pieces and coding. Isn't
a research problem. It's a

245
00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:14.850
problem solving a problem. I
wonder if there was a

246
00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:16.830
way or if we could
do a survey to find

247
00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:22.350
out the average time spent
coding in between Googling sessions.

248
00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:25.410
That's a really good question.
Yeah, for sure. And what,

249
00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:26.880
and what would that tell
us like, again, I don't

250
00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:30.510
want to draw any, any
qualitative conclusions or imply that

251
00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:33.870
one person is better or
lesser, but there must be

252
00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:36.990
a type of person who
spends, you know, an hour

253
00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:40.200
or two coding and then
they Google something and then

254
00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:41.850
they come back and then
there must be another person

255
00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:44.400
who's spending an hour Googling
and five minutes coding. And

256
00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:46.680
what can we learn about
that? And how can we

257
00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:49.500
use that information to help
everyone? Totally. And I think

258
00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:51.840
I would fall on both
sides of the spectrum, depending

259
00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:54.960
on what I'm building too.
If I'm building something in

260
00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:59.940
a language I'm super familiar
with, and I have been

261
00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:02.940
familiar with this problem and
solve something familiar in the

262
00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:06.060
past, then I might be
the person that's not Googling

263
00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:09.720
things for long periods of
time, but if it's something

264
00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:11.880
that's brand new to me,
like I probably be Googling

265
00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:15.180
more. That's a really great
point. I recently hooked up

266
00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:18.870
this, this keyboard, that's got
like these LEDs in the

267
00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:22.260
keys to show my blood
sugar and they wanted me

268
00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.270
to do it in node,
which I'm not good at.

269
00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:26.850
And I swear, I spent
like two hours looking for

270
00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:28.830
how to make a request
to node because I just,

271
00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:32.280
I found 50 11 ways
to do it. And I

272
00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:34.980
couldn't tell which one was
right. But if I was

273
00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:37.740
doing it in C sharp,
I would not be doing

274
00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:39.570
that at all. I wouldn't,
I would, I would have

275
00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:43.020
spent many, many less hours
Googling for that simply because

276
00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:45.270
I was not familiar, not
just that I wasn't familiar,

277
00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:47.730
but also that there was
no clear answer. That was

278
00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:50.910
a tough part. Everyone had
an opinion about how to

279
00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:53.840
make HTTP request in JavaScript
and they were all different.

280
00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:57.550
Yeah. I think the JavaScript
ecosystem is fascinating in that

281
00:14:57.550 --> 00:14:59.860
way, that there are so
many ways of doing things

282
00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:03.160
that are pretty much correct
at this point, but there's

283
00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:05.380
just a lot of ways
of doing anything with all

284
00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:07.690
the different frameworks that are
out there. That's funny that

285
00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:10.030
you point that out, that
it is so many ways

286
00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:11.830
that are, you just said
there are correct. Like I

287
00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:14.080
was looking for the way,
like the way in the

288
00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:16.780
light and the truths you're
saying that they were probably

289
00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:21.160
all correct. And that's scary.
Yeah, I think so. Just

290
00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.410
there are so many things
that are out there that

291
00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:26.470
you could totally use to
make a valid HDP request

292
00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:29.860
and have it work perfectly
fine, but maybe there are

293
00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:31.960
different trade offs. Like, are
you looking for something more

294
00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:34.240
efficient? Are you looking for
a lightweight library? Are you

295
00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:36.940
looking for something that's developer
friendly? Those are all the

296
00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:39.730
trade offs that come into
it. Well, let's talk about

297
00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:41.860
those. So just in a
few seconds, you rattled off

298
00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:45.580
some very thoughtful software engineering
type questions about like stuff,

299
00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:48.850
but how does a beginner
move past a tutorial and

300
00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:51.340
move into those kinds of
smart questions? Because sometimes when

301
00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:53.620
you go to an interview,
they ask you the question

302
00:15:53.650 --> 00:15:56.140
and then you freeze because
it's like a, I don't

303
00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:58.300
know the right answer, but
really the right answer is

304
00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:01.570
the five questions that you
just rattled off. Well, I

305
00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:04.630
think that answering the question
with more questions is sometimes

306
00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:07.500
the, the way they go
at it. I think that

307
00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:11.050
interviews are a tough format
in general, just because you're

308
00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:14.080
under pressure. And I don't
think clearly when I'm under

309
00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:19.660
pressure at all, I definitely
could solve questions way better

310
00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:23.260
outside of a high pressure
situation. But that being said,

311
00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:28.180
I think that coming at
it from those different perspectives

312
00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:30.340
is really important. That's something
that I want to bring

313
00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:33.850
to new developers. Like whenever
I'm teaching, I always say

314
00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:40.360
that teaching the syntax or
any of that is not,

315
00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:43.600
what's important to me in
this. Like you do have

316
00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:46.210
to be able to build
stuff, but what's a lot

317
00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:48.670
more important to me is
that, you know what questions

318
00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:51.640
to ask and how to
teach yourself how to code

319
00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:54.970
at the end of me
teaching you, because you know,

320
00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:57.460
I can teach you so
much about this one thing,

321
00:16:57.460 --> 00:16:59.710
but who knows what you're
actually going to be doing

322
00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:01.450
once you get out there.
And so it's way more

323
00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:03.760
important that you can take
what you learned here and

324
00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:07.630
apply it to something else
rather than actually knowing just

325
00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:11.050
the one way to do
things Hired the leading career

334
00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:46.660
we teach that to new
dads? You teach new devs,

335
00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:48.910
you've taught them at a
general assembly. You taught them

336
00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:51.150
all over. How do you,
like I was teaching my

337
00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:52.920
son how to code? And
then something we bumped into

338
00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:54.900
an issue and the issue
wasn't the code. It wasn't

339
00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:57.300
the syntax. It was like
the DNS server was messed

340
00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:00.060
up. That's not at all
what we were trying to

341
00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:02.130
do. So what do you
do if you're a full

342
00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:04.080
time dev and you've been
involved in dev for two

343
00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:05.730
or three years, and then
you're just now learning how

344
00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:09.210
DNS works, which is part
of infrastructure. Like suddenly you're

345
00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:10.800
driving in an Uber and
now you need to drive

346
00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:14.300
a stick shift. Yeah, it's
tough. I think a lot

347
00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:18.470
of that's researching and having
those skills to research stuff

348
00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:22.850
and also just the ability
to stick with it. I

349
00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:27.020
know like I've been writing
code for, I guess, six

350
00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:31.280
years now. And just last
week I was trying to

351
00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:34.400
debug a CSS issue that
wasn't actually a CSS issue.

352
00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:39.260
I forgot to close an
HTML tag. It's it's things

353
00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:41.840
like that. That really get
you because you're thinking, Oh,

354
00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:44.780
why does my CSS working?
Like, it's definitely the CSS,

355
00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:46.820
but it isn't it at
all. So I think a

356
00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:49.420
lot of it's just sticking
with it and keeping, trying

357
00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:52.010
things, looking at different things,
looking at things from different

358
00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:55.040
angles and knowing that sometimes
it'll take some time and

359
00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:57.230
sometimes it'll be really annoying,
but if you stick with

360
00:18:57.230 --> 00:19:00.440
it, it will eventually get
there. And then another thing

361
00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:03.260
is being willing to ask
people questions, because at some

362
00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:06.020
point maybe somebody else is
going to be able to

363
00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:08.900
solve that question in a
couple of minutes, whereas for

364
00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:11.540
you, it might be worth
it to learn that new

365
00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:14.690
thing and put that time
into it. But maybe it's

366
00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:17.660
more worth it to just
have somebody else solve that

367
00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:20.840
piece of the problem. I
think also it's important for

368
00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:24.890
people to know that, you
know, old timers like me

369
00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:28.100
or experienced programmers like yourself,
bump into this stuff all

370
00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:30.290
the time and we have
to get to that point

371
00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:32.540
ourselves. And we have to
get the junior engineers to

372
00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:35.000
the point where they can
feel that they can in

373
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.030
a safe place say, Hey,
I did this thing. And

374
00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:40.130
it was a silly, fun
error. Let's laugh about it

375
00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:42.650
and learn from it as
opposed to beating ourselves up

376
00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:45.440
about that. Like another person
might beat themselves up about

377
00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:49.460
the missing angle bracket, but
we all are like listening

378
00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:51.980
and going up. Yep. We've
all had the million dollar

379
00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:55.940
semi-colon or I commented that
code out or whatever, and

380
00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:58.040
we've spent hours staring at
it and it was like

381
00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:02.720
a checkbox or a missing.
Totally. I think the idea

382
00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:05.480
of having a safe place
to fail is super important

383
00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:14.690
and having a place that
isn't immediately getting, putting on

384
00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:17.270
the pressure in a situation
that there doesn't need to

385
00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:19.820
be a lot of pressure.
So giving time to do

386
00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:23.600
assignments when you're being onboarded
or knowing that certain things

387
00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:25.790
will take way less time
than you think they will.

388
00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:27.590
And some things will take
a lot more time than

389
00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:30.590
you think they will. And
having that place where it's

390
00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:33.500
not always a super high
pressure environment and you do

391
00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:36.950
have the ability to go
down the wrong road, come

392
00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:40.400
back and try a different
path. I think that that's

393
00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:42.920
really important in an educational
environment, but also in a

394
00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:46.160
work environment. Yeah. And optimizing
the amount of time that

395
00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:48.850
you like. I always believe
in fail fast fail often.

396
00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:54.010
So if I can avoid
spending like 17 hours debugging

397
00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:56.530
an issue that ends up
being a missing, semi-colon like,

398
00:20:56.530 --> 00:20:58.720
I'd like to do that,
but I do also want

399
00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.090
it to take a little
bit of time. Like I

400
00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:03.850
want to, I should waste
an hour trying to learn

401
00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:06.040
because there's a learning opportunity
there. You know what I

402
00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:08.470
mean? So there's that sweet
spot of this took a

403
00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:11.470
long time and I figured
it out versus this completely

404
00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:14.500
crushed my spirit and destroyed
my momentum. And I figured

405
00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:17.760
it out. Totally. I think
that like our role is

406
00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:20.400
a pretty good one. If
it's taking about an hour,

407
00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:23.220
then keep working on it
yourself. But if you're past

408
00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:25.620
that hour, Mark, try to
try to reach out to

409
00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:29.160
somebody else for a second
pair eyes. Have you noticed

410
00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:31.950
as you've probably taught people
of varying ages and across

411
00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:36.720
generations that I'm starting to
notice that people Google and

412
00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:38.940
I'm using Google and the
general like searching the internet

413
00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:45.120
term, people Google differently than
other people. I'm noticing my,

414
00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:50.370
my sons, which are teenagers,
Google full and complete sentences.

415
00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:54.360
Like they ask Google a
question as if it is

416
00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:57.270
a, a person like, how
do I bet that up?

417
00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:00.720
And I don't know if
Google is that good at

418
00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:02.940
answering full and complete sentences.
Cause it's looking for the

419
00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:05.820
word how and do I
and da, da. And I

420
00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:08.460
think they may not be
getting the right answers. Do

421
00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:10.470
you think that new devs
or devs that are like

422
00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:12.630
coming up in the last
four or five years tend

423
00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:15.150
to do that? Well, old
timers do the whole keyword

424
00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:18.720
Google search and how much
is Google searching or learning

425
00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:22.650
how to search a useful
thing to learn? Interesting. So

426
00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:26.100
I actually almost would have
noticed the opposite in my

427
00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:32.670
experience, but I think definitely
most developers that are successfully

428
00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:35.460
Googling things I think are
doing the kind of key

429
00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:39.570
word. Here's my error. And
this is what it's saying.

430
00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:42.960
And then here's the programming
language and that's it. That's

431
00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:45.300
kind of the best way
that I've found to find

432
00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:49.770
answers. As far as Googling,
I would get familiar with

433
00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:53.070
some of the like tricks
for Google like that. You

434
00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:55.470
can search things in quotation
marks in order to get

435
00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:58.650
an exact quote, you can
do a specific site search,

436
00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:01.200
all of those kind of
tips and tricks can make

437
00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:05.010
your Googling process a little
bit more helpful. So I

438
00:23:05.010 --> 00:23:06.990
think that that, that can
be good as well. That's

439
00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:08.880
a really good point. I
wonder if that'll go in

440
00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:11.280
your course on moving past
tutorials that you're going to

441
00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:14.160
put up at dev dot
T O yeah. Yeah, definitely.

442
00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:16.830
That's something that I definitely
want to include in there

443
00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:20.820
is a kind of guideline
for how to Google different

444
00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:26.580
issues. Then also what tips
and tricks can make your

445
00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:30.210
Googling process easier. <inaudible> yeah.
I keep coming back to

446
00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:33.060
that concept of smell, right?
Like you don't know how

447
00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:35.160
you develop your sense of
smell, but it just happens.

448
00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:37.890
And it's like, I may
not know Python, like, you

449
00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:39.660
know, Python and you may
not know she's sharp. Like

450
00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:40.860
I know she's sharp, but
I bet you that we

451
00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:42.660
could both look at some
code and we could go

452
00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:46.430
and really smell. Right. I
don't know why, but it

453
00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:48.950
smells wrong. And then if
we went searching for something

454
00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:50.900
on the internet, we could
also feel that the search

455
00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:54.260
results didn't smell. Right. Like
I should have found it.

456
00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:58.490
It must be that I
typed this search term wrong.

457
00:23:58.490 --> 00:24:00.290
And I, you know, cause
you, you feel in your

458
00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:02.750
soul that the, the answers
out there, you're just not,

459
00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:04.850
you're just not telling Google
the right stuff for it

460
00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:07.480
to give it to you.
Oh, totally. I've had so

461
00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:10.270
many students who are like,
I've Googled this thing over

462
00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:13.600
and over and over again.
And you know, I'm looking

463
00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:15.520
at it and I see
exactly what the issue is.

464
00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:17.380
And I'm like, if I
Google this right now, I

465
00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:19.960
would, I would find it,
but they don't know how

466
00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:23.020
to Google it properly yet.
And that's, it's hard to

467
00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:24.790
get used to it. I
think a lot of these

468
00:24:24.790 --> 00:24:27.250
things are honestly just time
and doing them over and

469
00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:29.830
over again and recognizing the
patterns that do work and

470
00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:33.160
recognizing the patterns that don't
work. But then again, we

471
00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:37.240
can also give people some
sneak hits in order to

472
00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:41.530
make that process a little
faster. How much do you

473
00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:45.910
find that like, like appropriate
uses of historical context or

474
00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:48.160
like dropping in little bits
of knowledge about how things

475
00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:50.860
used to be done? Sometimes
we were talking about like

476
00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:53.830
hard drive performance, the analogy
I was using, even though

477
00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:56.710
I'm old was a, of
a record player. And like,

478
00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:58.090
you know, you're talking about
like hard drives and how

479
00:24:58.090 --> 00:25:00.580
hard drives move around. If
you were trying to play

480
00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:03.760
a record, a music on
a record. And you know,

481
00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:06.670
the, let's say that the
song, the song was fragmented

482
00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:09.670
on the record, like the
needle would have to actually

483
00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:12.010
get up and go looking
for the rest of the

484
00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:15.280
song and get back down.
You would probably like slow

485
00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:17.080
the beat down and it
would probably make the song

486
00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:20.080
not sound right. And that
analogy worked really well for

487
00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:22.000
some people, but for other
people that didn't cause it's

488
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.150
an old analogy, but it
provided historical context about like

489
00:25:25.150 --> 00:25:28.720
how heads move around a
digital, you know, a hard

490
00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:34.450
drive. Yeah. So I think
knowing some of that stuff

491
00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:36.730
is really important. And teaching
with analogies, I think is

492
00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:40.900
also really important that concept
of linking where you're taking,

493
00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:43.600
what they know and then
teaching them something really tiny

494
00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:47.980
based off of what they
already know in teaching incrementally

495
00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:51.190
in that way is really
important. And then I also

496
00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:55.300
think having analogies that fit
your audience and are relevant

497
00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:59.110
for everybody, or is also
something that's really important. I

498
00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:02.260
was really passionate about making
sure that examples didn't fit

499
00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:06.790
into the like nerdy stereotypes.
I noticed that a lot

500
00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:08.980
of people teach with like
star Wars or Lord of

501
00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:13.750
the rings or star Trek.
I have never seen any

502
00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:17.260
of those things at all.
Blocked, blocked and reported we're

503
00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:24.520
stopping At all. And so
I would teach with like

504
00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:29.200
a Brittany Spears fan app as
one of my things, and

505
00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:32.050
it helped people's attention so
much because they thought it

506
00:26:32.050 --> 00:26:36.190
was super funny and super
out there. And it also

507
00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:40.210
kind of speaks to a
very different audience than maybe

508
00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:43.140
some of the, the other
examples of whatever. So that's

509
00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:46.020
something that I really strongly
believe in as well. I

510
00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:48.540
wrote an article earlier this
year, that was an introduction

511
00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:51.870
to like less based off
of Arianna's ground is thank

512
00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:57.360
you next. And that kind
of went crazy on Twitter

513
00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:59.880
and it was definitely a
really fun article to write.

514
00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:02.190
And if you look at
like the analytics of who

515
00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:04.980
is reading it, it was
really different than the normal

516
00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:07.020
tech audience, which I thought
was really cool as well.

517
00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:08.420
So that makes me wonder
if I need to do

518
00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:12.410
something about like Intel processors
as it relates to like

519
00:27:12.410 --> 00:27:16.310
seven rings. I'm just saying
there's like a thing there

520
00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:18.710
that could potentially be done.
And this used, here's an

521
00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:22.460
interesting thing though, that like
when it is an analogy

522
00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:27.080
on Tolkien or something, star
Trekkie people find that exclusionary.

523
00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:29.360
But if I, as a,
as a star Trek fan

524
00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:32.090
or star Wars fan was
in a tutorial and you

525
00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:34.910
did something on, you know,
my little pony friendship is

526
00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:37.490
magic, I would find that
charming and awesome. And I

527
00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:40.310
would totally roll with it.
So it's interesting that some

528
00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:45.440
fandoms are somewhat exclusionary while
others are, are more, you

529
00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:47.930
know, more cool. Like I
would think of Brittany Spears analogy

530
00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:49.610
would be awesome and I
would be more engaged like,

531
00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:53.510
Yeah, I think it's more
just having a balance than

532
00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:57.590
totally cutting one type out.
I think having those examples

533
00:27:57.590 --> 00:28:00.170
is great. It's just that
the other examples should be

534
00:28:00.170 --> 00:28:03.200
in there as well, so
that you're hitting all your

535
00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:07.850
different audiences instead of always
appealing to one part. That's

536
00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:11.390
really cool. I talk about
the importance of localizing your

537
00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:14.600
talk and I don't mean
picking language, even though that's

538
00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:17.480
important, who's your audience and
are there are all of

539
00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:21.980
your slides, your words, your
analogies, your references going to

540
00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:24.680
land. You can't go. Maybe
you couldn't go and do

541
00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:27.920
that. Brittany Spears thing in another
country where she wasn't popular.

542
00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:31.910
Totally. You know, and then
find out whoever the Brittany Spears

543
00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:34.940
of Bulgaria is and then
use that person for your,

544
00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:37.970
for your app. Totally. Totally.
And then you get a

545
00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:40.880
pop culture, primary and another
country too. Yeah. That's a

546
00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:43.190
great way to do things.
So your new, your new

547
00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:45.740
course that you're working on
moving past tutorials, how long

548
00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:46.820
do you think it's going
to take and are you

549
00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:48.470
going to release it as
it comes? Or is this

550
00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:49.820
something that we're going to
wait a few months for?

551
00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:53.240
Yeah. So I'm going to
be releasing parts of it

552
00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:58.340
weekly so that I can
iterate on feedback and build

553
00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:02.150
off of what people are
liking. Maybe minimize stuff that

554
00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:06.200
people aren't enjoying as much
and really tailor it to

555
00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:08.900
the audience that comes from
it. So it's going to

556
00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:12.650
be definitely incrementally pushed and
I'm really excited about it.

557
00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:14.930
I am trying to make
it appeal to as many

558
00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:18.530
learning styles as possible. So
it's going to video and

559
00:29:18.530 --> 00:29:22.730
visual and written and link
out to other resources. So

560
00:29:23.390 --> 00:29:26.540
definitely we'll be trying to
appeal to as many problem-solvers

561
00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:29.150
as possible. Yeah. I think
it'd be really helpful to

562
00:29:29.150 --> 00:29:31.070
be able to break down
problems that we see in

563
00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:33.530
interviews. I have a friend
who recently did not do

564
00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:36.170
well at an interview, not
just because, you know, it's

565
00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:38.240
white boarding and it's uncomfortable
and all that kind of

566
00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:41.680
usual interviews suck type stuff.
But because the actual breaking

567
00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:44.710
down of a problem was
complicated. It was about sorting

568
00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:47.410
coins. Like imagine if coins
are rolling down and they

569
00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:50.380
need to be sorted into
particular buckets and stuff like

570
00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:54.400
that. And I think that
if the breaking down was

571
00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:57.640
clearer and the tools available
to you were clearer, it

572
00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:00.450
would have been a more
successful interview. Yeah, I agree.

573
00:30:00.450 --> 00:30:04.080
I think that the interview
process is definitely broken, but

574
00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:07.950
there's also some validity that
those problems are so difficult

575
00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:11.130
because they have such a
huge problem solving component to

576
00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:14.520
them. And that can really
challenge people. And it's important

577
00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:17.490
to test those skills because
that is what they're going

578
00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:21.930
to be using. And so,
I mean, from an interviewer

579
00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:24.090
perspective, it's how do you
test that in a fair

580
00:30:24.090 --> 00:30:27.600
way, but then on an
interview B perspective, it's how

581
00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:31.470
do I solve these problems
accurately and really think about

582
00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:33.450
all the different components that
go into it and all

583
00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:36.900
the edge cases that can
happen and how to stay

584
00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:39.870
with it. When they ask
you that the twist question

585
00:30:39.870 --> 00:30:42.420
a little bit further in
Now you said that you're

586
00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:44.970
going to be using the
you're gonna be using Python.

587
00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:47.610
You're in your favorite language
of choice to do this,

588
00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:49.920
but the course is mostly
language agnostic. So even though

589
00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:51.600
I'm not a big Python
head, I'm going to be

590
00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:54.330
able to follow along. Yes.
So it's going to be

591
00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:58.350
totally language agnostic in that
you can solve any of

592
00:30:58.350 --> 00:31:01.590
these problems in any programming
language. The only reason I'm

593
00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:06.030
using Python is because the
syntax of Python looks pretty

594
00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:09.600
similar to spoken word. And
so I switched in between

595
00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:11.760
Python and Java script is
my kind of two primary

596
00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:15.960
languages. JavaScript, relies a lot
more on symbols, whereas Python

597
00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:20.100
resolve revolves more on like
written word. And so I

598
00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:23.010
think that if somebody was
looking at it, Python will

599
00:31:23.010 --> 00:31:27.240
look more like written word.
That was my next question.

600
00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:30.900
It's kind of like pseudo-code.
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Where are

601
00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:32.130
people gonna be able to
check this out? They just

602
00:31:32.130 --> 00:31:35.610
go to dev.co and then
a hospital, and that's where

603
00:31:35.610 --> 00:31:37.440
they would follow you or
is there a specific URL

604
00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:41.070
for it? Totally dev to
a spittle and the post

605
00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:43.140
will be going up on
there. It'll also be a

606
00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:46.410
series. So if you go
to that starter post, everything

607
00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:48.780
will be linked up. Okay,
cool. We're going to make

608
00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:51.600
sure that we've got links
directly to of course your

609
00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:54.840
page, but also even after
this podcast has been published,

610
00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:56.580
we'll make sure to put
in additional links in the

611
00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:58.800
show notes. So if you're
listening to this show, you

612
00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:00.240
can go down to the
show notes and check it

613
00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:02.490
out and we'll have links
to out to Ali's work.

614
00:32:02.910 --> 00:32:05.670
Thanks so much for chatting
with me today. Awesome. Thank

615
00:32:05.670 --> 00:32:09.060
you. This has been another
episode of Hansel minutes and

616
00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:30.810
we'll see you again next
week. <inaudible>.
