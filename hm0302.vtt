<inaudible> from hanselminutes.com. It's Hanselman.
It's a weekly discussion with

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.930
web developer and technologist Scott
Hanselman. This is Lawrence Ryan announcing

asp.net web applications online@wwwdottelerik.com. In
this episode, Scott talks with

7
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.650
John skeet. I'm here with
John skeet. You work at

8
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.800
Google. Yes, I do. I
do. Which is a fabulous

9
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.440
place to work, but I
don't speak on behalf of

10
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.770
them. So this is pretty,
pretty much all we'll say

11
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.530
about Google, I think. Okay.
It's a brilliant place to

12
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.220
work, but you made it
through the interview process. Yes.

13
00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:10.200
Yes. And we do have
a difficult interview process because

14
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.940
we want the best of
the best as I'm sure

15
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.990
Microsoft does as well. And
every one of my colleagues,

16
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.980
including myself, we all feel
we are the one person

17
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.990
to get through this. I
wouldn't say a nasty interview

18
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.940
process. It's a lot of
fun, even if you don't

19
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.870
get through, it's a lot
of fun, but it's, it's

20
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.430
tricky. And we all feel
that we managed to squeak

21
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.820
through and fool our friends
now, friends and our interviewers

22
00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.220
at the time. And to
thinking that we had some

23
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.670
special powers that we didn't
feel that we've got ourselves.

24
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:49.260
So sincerely without false humility,
you and your peers at

25
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.380
the big multinational company that
dare not speak its name,

26
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.700
honestly, think that like you
could be found out. Yeah,

27
00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.360
I think by now, so
I've been there nearly four

28
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.180
years and I sorta think
I can now fit in

29
00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.050
properly so that I know
how I can make my

30
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.650
way and contribute, but equally
I can look at all

31
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:14.130
my peers and think, wow,
you guys are smart. And

32
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.080
everyone that is smart in
some different way. And they're

33
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.650
all really, really nice guys
as well. How did I

34
00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.880
get here basically? Are there
people who are there that

35
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.830
you don't know why they're
still there? Like how did

36
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.330
this guy make it to
the project? If I made

37
00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.710
it through the process, how
did this guy make it

38
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.510
to depression? Let's say, I
can't think of anyone offhand.

39
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.510
So you, you honestly stack
rank yourself, like on the

40
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.130
left side of the bell
curve, within my colleagues, your

41
00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:49.410
colleagues. Yeah. So lower average.
Yeah, I think so. And

42
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.350
certainly is there, there are
certainly people who achieve much

43
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.560
more while they're there. I
have, I regard myself as

44
00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.280
having a fairly healthy work
life balance. So I don't

45
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.570
push myself. I work hard
for the company, but I

46
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.870
don't kill myself for the
company. And there are some

47
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.130
people who will just achieve
monumental things and you, you

48
00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.200
see what they're doing in
their normal day to day

49
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.900
job and you think, and
then you're managing to do

50
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.760
other things outside the normal
projects. How do you find

51
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.350
the time? It's crazy. And
is it based just entirely

52
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.510
on they're working harder than
you are? Or are they

53
00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.800
working more hours? It's finding
the right things to work

54
00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.730
on and finding the right
people to work with and

55
00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.570
being smarter. I'm absolutely sure
of it. I'm not saying

56
00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.330
that I'm sort of the
least smart person there, but

57
00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:47.520
I'm far, far from the
smartest by miles. So let's,

58
00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.340
let's set a little context
and explain to people who

59
00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.560
might not know who you
are. Cause I was at,

60
00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.740
we were at dinner yesterday
and I switched tables at

61
00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.240
the end of the dinner
to talk to some friends.

62
00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.970
And then I, you were
leaving and I said, Hey,

63
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.150
it's John skating in a
wave and you waved. And,

64
00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.060
and then you left. And
the guys at the table,

65
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.790
the four that I was
sitting with at, you saw

66
00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:13.890
said, who's that? And I
just said, it's John ski.

67
00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.720
He's got his own search
engine. I mean, he's got

68
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.510
like, you know, he's the
number one guy on stack

69
00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.320
overflow. And I told him
some of the John skied

70
00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.080
questions and the style of
Chuck Norris helped to build

71
00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.930
the legend and you know
what they said? They said,

72
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.330
wow. He seems like a
really nice guy. Oh, that's

73
00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.210
honestly what they said. They
said, Oh, I really, and

74
00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.870
then, then the discussion turned
into, I really like it

75
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.450
when amazing people that are
super smart are very, very

76
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.260
nice. Right. And then I
said, I don't know if

77
00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.810
he thinks he's that smart.
We'll have to ask him

78
00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.910
Well, so it is the
amazing people who are super

79
00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.690
smart. That just gets me
new. It's it's all an

80
00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.960
impression. And I think we
were saying this yesterday, that

81
00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:05.580
if you can explain things,
even relatively simple things, if

82
00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.200
you can cotton onto ideas
and persuade people of them

83
00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.130
in a, maybe a different
style, just some way that

84
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.250
they haven't heard before, then
people will think you're much

85
00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.140
smarter than you really are.
So I feel like I'm

86
00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:22.770
constantly bluffing on stack overflow.
It's not that I think

87
00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:27.420
my answers are wrong. They're
fine. I'm, I'm proud of

88
00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.250
what I do on stack
overflow. Don't get me wrong,

89
00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:33.600
but I don't think it's
actually a measure of smartness.

90
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.090
I think it's a measure
of being able to find

91
00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.820
the resources. So I'm good
at using search engines. I'm

92
00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.340
good at finding things in
the C sharp spec. And

93
00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.470
I read the C chops
back, you know, there's nothing,

94
00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.330
you don't have to be
a genius to read a

95
00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:50.070
specification. I know the spec
better than some other people,

96
00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:55.050
but anyone can look things
up and I can somehow

97
00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.060
explain things a bit. And
that's really all there is

98
00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.010
to it. And that's not,
that's not a cause of

99
00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:05.450
genius or anything. It's, it's
useful. It's really handy as

100
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:07.670
a skill. And I don't
know where I particularly got

101
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:10.130
it from. And I don't
think I would rate it

102
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.860
as highly as many other
people who have a real

103
00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.410
gift for just putting, do
you know when, when someone

104
00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:18.060
explains something, you think that
is so clear, it's like

105
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:22.520
crystal clarity that no one's
ever achieved on that topic

106
00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:25.460
in my hearing before. Yeah.
And that will happen sometimes.

107
00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:30.140
I'm not nearly there, but
I'm just above where many

108
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.930
other people are. I think
actually that in itself is

109
00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:38.150
a line where people use
the term expert pretty readily

110
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.090
these days. So if you
say to someone what's in

111
00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:43.790
a.net string and they say,
well, it's a sequence of

112
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:48.140
UTF 16 code units, then
that's actually correct. And Sony,

113
00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:52.310
they sound like you're an
expert on Unicode. Yeah. I

114
00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:55.100
may know a little bit
more than someone else. And

115
00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:57.350
that's all it takes. If
you can see that someone

116
00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:59.870
knows more than you is
very hard to work out

117
00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:02.750
how much more they know
than you, because you don't

118
00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:04.250
know what you don't know.
If you see what I

119
00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:08.300
mean. It's like Donald Rumsfeld's
unknown unknowns. I think his,

120
00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:11.570
his quote was unfortunately bashed
for, he said something that

121
00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:16.160
did actually make sense there.
So if you can't really

122
00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:20.000
tell how much more someone
knows than you do, it's

123
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.520
very easy to just jump
to the assumption that they

124
00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:26.150
know huge amounts. And they're
a genius. No, they knew

125
00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.470
something more than you. My
wife is going back to

126
00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:31.630
school, which is funny, cause
she has an MBA, but

127
00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:32.980
she wants to go back
to school and become a

128
00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:37.700
nurse. So she is brushing
up on some math, right.

129
00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:39.760
So we go up to
the Khan Academy and we

130
00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:43.420
do the algebra two kind
of mid level, you know,

131
00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:46.030
graphs and stuff. And they
started busting out a couple

132
00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:50.290
of things like, you know,
to, to the square root

133
00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:52.360
of something. And then you
have to figure out what

134
00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:53.710
you have to remember. Like,
what do you do with

135
00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:56.400
the two, right? Is it
like the times, or did

136
00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:57.730
you put it up there?
You have all those little

137
00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:00.430
rules about like, you know,
log this and that the

138
00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:03.070
exponent goes there and it
was all just, you know,

139
00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:06.130
moving numbers around. And in
my mind, I remember that

140
00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:09.820
there was a thing where
you, you know, to do

141
00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:13.030
something and I just could
not pull it out. No,

142
00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:16.030
but I've talked to people
that work just in everyday

143
00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:18.760
discussions and something like that
will come up and there

144
00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.680
are people my age and
they just seem to have

145
00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:25.090
that stuff just ready to
yeah. Right there. And I

146
00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:28.600
then silently feel stupid, I
think to myself because I

147
00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:32.440
don't remember the quadratic equation.
Right. I just don't I

148
00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:35.680
know it's like two plus
or minus something as a

149
00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:38.500
square root. And then over
four AC, I don't know

150
00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:42.100
what it is. Yeah. Do
you know it Plus or

151
00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:48.430
minus four ACO? No, I
can't over two eight. I

152
00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:50.980
can't remember you and I
are idiots. Yeah. I've got

153
00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:53.530
a math degree, so that's
sort of the worse. But

154
00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:57.120
see then that just makes
me feel like I should've,

155
00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.970
I should've gone to MIT.
You know, I went, I

156
00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:02.760
visited, I didn't feel comfortable.
I went to a community

157
00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:06.030
college instead. I wasn't emotionally
ready to go to MIT.

158
00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:08.840
It was one of the
smartest guys I work with

159
00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:12.790
all of that. I generally
have breakfast with. He always,

160
00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:15.410
he feels there. How did
he squeak by? Because he

161
00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:19.010
doesn't have a degree at
all at all. I think,

162
00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:23.180
forgive me, Greg, if that's
wrong, but he blows me

163
00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:26.690
away. He will be talking
about any topic pretty much

164
00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:29.660
that he's willing to talk
about. He will have considered

165
00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:32.900
opinions, ones that I may
disagree with or not, but

166
00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:36.530
he will have considered opinions
and reasons behind them. And

167
00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:39.470
he's just one of those
people that you just suck

168
00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:43.850
up their energy that just
comes all the time. And

169
00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:46.340
he's so smart. The whole
time Someone told me a

170
00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:47.990
story. I don't know. It's
always fun to have like,

171
00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:50.300
you know, mid-thought mythological stories
of people who aren't here,

172
00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:53.330
but you know, everyone knows
that Scott goo knows a

173
00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:56.600
lot about everything, the web
and everything. Someone said that

174
00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:00.260
they were in like England
or somewhere with Scott Fu

175
00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:03.290
and in a casual after
the conference kind of an

176
00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:05.330
affair. And they were standing
in front of like a

177
00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:08.030
castle or some old pile
of rocks. And he just

178
00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:10.820
started reciting like chapter and
verse about what happened in

179
00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:13.460
like 16, 15, and this
spot in like this random

180
00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:17.450
place, you know? And again,
I don't know if this

181
00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:19.430
is exactly true or whatever,
but they were like, how

182
00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:20.720
do you know that? It's
like, Oh, it's, you know,

183
00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:24.410
that's 16th century English history
is one of my hobbies

184
00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.720
or whatever. You know, I,
I, I almost did my

185
00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:28.850
PhD dissertation in it or
something like that, you know?

186
00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:31.820
And you just go, wow,
really? And you're well-rounded and

187
00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:33.110
then you find out, of
course, that they're on a

188
00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:36.230
rowing team and then not
only smart and funny, you

189
00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:39.740
know, Absolutely hate them. Oh,
they're awful if they weren't

190
00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:42.500
so incredibly nice as well.
Oh, it's the word. There

191
00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:45.680
is no way anyone could
hate Scott group would be

192
00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:49.940
impossible. Does He doesn't seem
to have any sense of

193
00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:53.720
imposter, imposter theory and the
imposter. What's this? What is

194
00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:59.960
this? That, that sense? Like
phony Einstein had imposter syndrome.

195
00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:03.050
He thought he wasn't smart
enough. Cause all his life

196
00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:05.570
he was told he wasn't
smart enough. Right. Does that

197
00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:07.220
drive us forward though? I
mean, do we all have

198
00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:10.340
this secret shame? I think
it depends on how you

199
00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:13.910
treat it. So some people
will be driven by feeling

200
00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:16.610
themselves not smart enough. So
I will be driven to

201
00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:20.330
find out more about everything
and improve myself and other

202
00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:23.090
people that will crush them.
So I think it should

203
00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:25.910
be something that you do
to yourself if it's useful

204
00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:29.780
rather than other people doing
it to you. But I

205
00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:33.350
think it's healthy to have
a healthy disrespect for yourself.

206
00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.970
I like a healthy disrespect
for yourself. Someone told me

207
00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:42.560
though, that having an overdeveloped
sense of an imposter syndrome,

208
00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.660
a sense of you are
a phony. It can be

209
00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:49.070
a sign of depression. Ah,
possibly. I, I don't know

210
00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:53.290
anything about psychology and friends.
I'm not depressed. I thoroughly

211
00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:56.830
enjoy my life. Yeah. I
go through, I go through

212
00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:58.770
it with people coming up
to me and say, wow,

213
00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:01.570
love what you're doing on
whatever. You're amazing. I'm thinking

214
00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:03.490
I'm not, but it's so
nice of you to say

215
00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:06.280
so how could I be
depressed when yeah. The one

216
00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:09.220
that I feel a phony,
but equally it means everyone's

217
00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:11.460
really nice to me. Yeah.
The one that I get

218
00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:13.290
a lot is how do
you get so much done?

219
00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:17.850
Right. Just doing stuff. Like
what are you doing? One

220
00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:19.680
really nice guy came up
to me and he said,

221
00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:21.720
I'm a single guy. I
have no kids. I have

222
00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:24.810
no hobbies. And I don't,
I don't, you know, I'm

223
00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:26.130
barely able to get the
stuff done that I want

224
00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:28.290
to get done. How do
you get done? And you've

225
00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:30.480
got kids and it's like,
I don't know, man. I

226
00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:32.850
mean, yeah, what are you
doing all the time? Let's

227
00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:34.350
break it down hour by
hour. What are you doing?

228
00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:36.720
Absolutely. And I feel I
don't get stuff done. So

229
00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:38.790
I'm looking at, you know,
I've got my new to

230
00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:41.190
time project, open source project
for a new date and

231
00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:44.280
time API that has been
sitting, not in a V

232
00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:48.900
one for over two years
now. So I'm not getting

233
00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:52.020
it done. There's two books
on C sharp. I want

234
00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:53.820
to be writing at the
moment, but I haven't found

235
00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:56.220
the time to actually get
around to it yet. There's

236
00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:57.690
another book that I'm meant
to be editing and I'm

237
00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:01.470
not finding the time. So
they see that I'm always

238
00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:03.810
answering stack overflow questions, which
stops me from getting other

239
00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:06.390
stuff done. Of course. And
that's just, I'm a terrible

240
00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:10.140
procrastinator. If I don't have
to do something right now,

241
00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:14.790
I probably will leave it
until tomorrow. So I don't

242
00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:17.760
get nearly as much stuff
done as some people seem

243
00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:21.570
to think. And I'm sure
if, if each person took

244
00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:24.630
a look at what they
were actually getting done, there

245
00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:26.910
wouldn't be this huge gap
that people seem to imagine

246
00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:31.770
someone said that, But you
know, like half of success

247
00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:36.750
is just showing up. Absolutely.
And I think that like

248
00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:38.400
the reason that some people
are like, Oh, I love

249
00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:41.760
your podcast. I feel okay
about the podcast. I think

250
00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:45.120
we've, we've caught our stride.
Right? There's a couple of

251
00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:48.150
shows that don't go quite
the way I want, whether

252
00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:50.400
it be, I didn't research
the topic enough or the

253
00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.350
audio quality isn't good enough,
but for the most part

254
00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:54.840
it's okay. But honestly, the
weeds and I think the

255
00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:58.290
show does okay. Is because
it's consistent. Right. And I've

256
00:13:58.290 --> 00:14:00.660
been doing 300 shows every
day. Know I haven't missed

257
00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:05.640
a week in five years,
Phil, for everyone else who's

258
00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:09.810
trying to blog or whatever,
seeing that kind of consistency.

259
00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:13.380
So I, But it could
be consistently bad though. It's

260
00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:16.290
just consistent though. Okay. But
if it were consistently bad,

261
00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.680
you would improve true. And
the fact that you can

262
00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:21.780
see now, well, there are
some shows that maybe I

263
00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:24.150
didn't do enough research or
the audit quality. You can

264
00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:27.330
see things that you can
improve. So over time, even

265
00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:30.240
if you don't know how
you're improving things, those will

266
00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:34.530
improve. So I'll give you
an example. In my first

267
00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:37.890
sort of six months of
working at Google, I wasn't

268
00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:41.340
very good at making cappuccino.
I couldn't froth the milk

269
00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:44.550
well, so I nearly set
it as one of my

270
00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:48.180
okay. Ours objectives and key
results that I would learn

271
00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:51.650
how to froth milk properly.
And I didn't actually do

272
00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:53.810
that, but I gradually got
better and I couldn't even

273
00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:58.280
pinpoint how I got better
and more significantly. I not

274
00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:01.610
sure that I could really
teach someone else now how

275
00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:04.220
to do not nothing, but
now I can, I can

276
00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:07.640
do a pretty good cappuccino.
Yeah. You, if you, if

277
00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:10.100
someone comes to London, come
visit me. I will make

278
00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:14.330
you a cappuccino. You will
not complain. It's good. But

279
00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:17.540
it is. I had to
drink many, many cups of

280
00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:20.780
coffee. It was so hard
just showing up and having

281
00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:23.030
another cup of coffee I
would get in in the

282
00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:26.690
morning. Oh, alright. I'll have
another coffee. I will eventually

283
00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:30.080
get at the milk. Yeah.
Okay. I love coffee, but

284
00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:32.960
it is that consistency of
keeping, trying it again. And

285
00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:35.510
again makes such a difference.
You kept showing up. I

286
00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:40.190
did, without knowing, assuming I
would improve without knowing what

287
00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:43.690
I would be doing to
improve. So there's, there's conscious

288
00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:45.790
focused. I'm going to lose
weight. I'm going to learn

289
00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:48.880
to do this. I'm going
to improve this thing. And

290
00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:52.450
then there's simply the showing
up, like with stack overflow,

291
00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:54.670
you just, you, you, you,
that's something you do every

292
00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:56.380
day. You brush your teeth,
you do your stack overflow

293
00:15:56.770 --> 00:16:00.070
Pretty much usually the other
order. Okay. But what if

294
00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:01.870
you didn't do it for
a week or two weeks?

295
00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:04.870
Have you ever fallen off
the wagon? So I have

296
00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:09.160
occasionally not done it. If
I'm on holiday, sometimes I

297
00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:11.830
will post. Sometimes I rent.
So I went to Florence

298
00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:15.280
last year and the, the
hotel room had wifi connection

299
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.240
and a laptop in the
hotel room. So yes, sometimes

300
00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:22.210
when, you know, Holly was
having a nap or whatever,

301
00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:24.460
I would go and start
over float, but I've never,

302
00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:26.770
I've never felt like right.
I'm going to take a

303
00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:30.790
week off. Cause it doesn't
feel like something that, that

304
00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:33.550
you take a week off
just because it doesn't feel

305
00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:36.250
like a job. It's something
I do for fun. And

306
00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:38.800
it is a pleasure to
do. And I always feel

307
00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:40.900
that the fact that I
found something that is a

308
00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:44.080
pleasure to do that hopefully
does help people. I am

309
00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:46.420
so lucky. If, if everyone
in the world can find

310
00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:50.230
something that they love doing
that helps people. Wow. That's

311
00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:53.650
a huge force. If you
look at someone did a

312
00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:57.580
study once on how many
hours it took to produce

313
00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:00.850
all the content on Wikipedia.
And then they took a

314
00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:05.140
look at how many TV
hours Americans watched every day

315
00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:08.590
or something. And we could
be doing so many Wikipedia

316
00:17:08.650 --> 00:17:13.120
style projects, Wikipedia scale projects
every day. If people can

317
00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:16.330
find something that is fun
and useful at the same

318
00:17:16.330 --> 00:17:18.760
time. So that's where Jeff
and Joel and all the

319
00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:24.520
rest have really done wonders.
And it's not, it's the

320
00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:27.880
whole package. It's not that
they've got a bad system.

321
00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:29.560
It's not that they've got
a rep system. It's that

322
00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:31.960
the whole thing hangs together
into something that is fun.

323
00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:36.190
And the competitive parts is,
yeah, it's fun. That's definitely

324
00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:38.350
a part of it, but
it's not so that you

325
00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:41.650
can say I'm the best
it's because it just makes

326
00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:45.910
it a little bit more
enjoyable. And I think that's

327
00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:49.830
an amazing thing. How, how
close is number two from

328
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:54.140
you? I think at the
moment Mark Ravel is number

329
00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:58.640
two. I think he's about
120,000 behind. And I think

330
00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:01.220
Darren Dimitrov is about we're
in, I don't know, about

331
00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:06.140
140,000 behind, but Darren's catching
up with Mark. So who

332
00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:09.110
knows? And for the few
people who may be listening,

333
00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:11.390
who may not be familiar
with stack overflow, it's effectively

334
00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:14.000
the intersection of a blog,
a Wiki and a forum.

335
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.040
It's a community based massively
multiplayer questions and answer site.

336
00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:20.990
I sort of, I think
of it as used net

337
00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:24.740
V2 in some ways, but
very much focused on being

338
00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:28.610
Q and a. So it's
not a social network, although

339
00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:32.420
there's a community around it.
So people know names and

340
00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:36.800
things, but it's not somewhere
that you have a social

341
00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:39.450
network where you reach out
to people so much. There's,

342
00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:43.820
there's, chat-bots, there's matter all
kinds of things that are

343
00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:48.200
around social, but it's deliberately
not a social network. Right.

344
00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:51.650
But yeah, it's questions and
answers questions, And you are

345
00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:55.370
given points for every action
You are given points. Well,

346
00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:58.880
ha this is where I
get bitter because you are

347
00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:02.930
given points by your peers
mostly. So if you post

348
00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:05.600
a question or an answer,
people can upvote it or

349
00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:09.140
downvote it to say, yes,
this was helpful or well-worded

350
00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:12.500
question or whatever, or downvote
it to say, yeah, this

351
00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:15.140
question is really poorly worded
or your answer is just

352
00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:18.130
plain wrong, or you copied
it from somewhere else without

353
00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:23.090
attribution or any negative things.
And you get points for

354
00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:25.970
being upvoted. You get a
few points knocked off for

355
00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:29.180
being down voted, and you
get some points. If your

356
00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:32.360
answer is accepted and there's
a cap on how much

357
00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:35.390
you can get every day,
just through people saying, yes,

358
00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:38.780
I like this answer cap
of 200 points. And then

359
00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:42.110
after that, you only get
any other points through either

360
00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:46.310
accepted answers or bounty questions,
which are sort of, I

361
00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:48.980
think this question is really,
really important to me. So

362
00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:52.790
I will sacrifice some of
my reputation to give it

363
00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:56.720
to whoever does the best
answer on this question. And

364
00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:00.350
there's this rep cap that
steals my rep every day.

365
00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:02.930
What do you mean a
rep cap or rep you

366
00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:04.670
meaning that you can only
put in so much effort.

367
00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:05.930
And then at that point,
there's no reason for you

368
00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:09.890
to bother. You can only
get so much through voting.

369
00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:13.580
So the rep cap is
200 a day. So if,

370
00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:17.030
if I get 25 upvotes
in a day that will

371
00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:20.180
only get me 200 rep
the other 50 rep. So

372
00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:23.030
it's 10, 10 points per
outfit for answers. The other

373
00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:27.560
50 rep is wasted as
it were. So you're saying

374
00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:30.770
because of your standing and
your pervasiveness, you're all over

375
00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:32.870
the place. People are bumping
into you all the time,

376
00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:36.470
uploading stuff that you're doing.
And that's all just rounding

377
00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:40.580
errors that are overflowing. Yeah.
So every so often someone

378
00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:43.640
will answer and it's a
daily thing. It goes for

379
00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:46.760
a UTC day. So you
can get 200, three votes.

380
00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:50.830
You can more for accepted
answers. So amongst, I don't

381
00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:53.110
know how you even put
it amongst the top answers.

382
00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:57.400
If there is any competition
it's for accepted answers because

383
00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:00.700
votes are cheap as it
were. So I can't remember

384
00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:02.590
the last time I didn't
get the 10 or the

385
00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:04.720
20 votes in a day
that takes you to the

386
00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:06.490
rep cap, but it was
a long time ago. And

387
00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:10.690
usually mostly through having a
long tail. And this is

388
00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:14.230
where, you know, just showing
up, comes up again. I

389
00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:17.320
will get five votes a
day for answers that are

390
00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:20.050
over a year old, over
two years old. And so

391
00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:23.830
obviously that ends up being
something that carries you through

392
00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:26.470
that. If I didn't show
up for a whole week,

393
00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:29.920
I may or may not
hit the rap cap every

394
00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:32.140
day. I wouldn't be surprised
for, for a few days,

395
00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:34.570
at least I'm sure I
would. And after that, you

396
00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:38.620
know, without any even fairly
recent answers, it would start

397
00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:42.850
to start to go. And
this isn't just to clarify,

398
00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:45.460
the rep is all, we've
talked about pretty much on

399
00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:47.560
stack overflow, but it's not
the be all and end

400
00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:49.840
all. And I think people
sometimes make the mistake of

401
00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:52.930
thinking that's all that people
are interested in. And I

402
00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:54.520
would far rather give an
answer that is going to

403
00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:57.250
be useful and not give
me any points at all,

404
00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:02.320
but is useful to someone
then do something else, research,

405
00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:05.050
something that is only useful
to one person, but gets

406
00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:07.660
a big bounty or whatever.
I'd rather just be useful

407
00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:10.080
to lots of people. So
that's really interesting. So as

408
00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:13.620
you're describing this point system
and rep and the way

409
00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:16.710
that you've, let's say game
to the negative way, but

410
00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.690
the way you are conscious
and aware of the rules

411
00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:22.380
of the game. Yep. And
this idea that if you

412
00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:25.170
don't show up, you're still
gonna get some residual stuff

413
00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.210
because of the goodness that
you have kind of left

414
00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:30.150
out there in the world.
I'm translating this into my

415
00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:32.790
head, into the game that
I play, which is blogging.

416
00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:38.700
Right. So you'll still get
some hits. <inaudible> April will

417
00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:42.300
be 10 years. Wow. Yeah.
I have to do something

418
00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:44.070
for the tenure. I can't
even think what I was

419
00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:46.980
doing 10 years ago. Yeah.
So yeah. It'll be, it'll

420
00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:49.710
be 10 years. I think
it's yeah. 10 years, which

421
00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:51.510
seems like a long time,
but at the same time,

422
00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:53.130
every once in a while,
I just wake up and

423
00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:55.500
freak out. Cause we're in
2012. Right. Where's my Jetpack.

424
00:22:56.490 --> 00:23:00.440
So how many posts is
that? Oh man. It's couple

425
00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:05.520
thousand three, 4,000 maybe. Wow.
Yeah. I don't know. It's

426
00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:11.760
a lot. What does that,
so 3,360, 3,650 days. It's

427
00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:15.030
gotta be upwards of 2000,
2,500, maybe. So to really

428
00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:18.120
freak yourself out sometime you
should get a script to

429
00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:21.480
grab just all the texts
from it and work out

430
00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:23.970
how many books. Oh. Don't
even do that to me.

431
00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:27.480
How many thousand pages? Yeah,
probably a lot. Probably a

432
00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:30.540
lot. I know for a
while there, my posts per

433
00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:33.630
month was in the thirties,
but it's lowered now. Yeah.

434
00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:36.060
30 good solid posts a
month are going almost like

435
00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:38.780
60 pages of texts every
month. But I lowered it

436
00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:42.120
now it's more like 15,
20, right. I really am

437
00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:44.580
focused on quality right now.
I don't, I looked, I

438
00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:47.270
looked back some of my
older stuff and I'm sure

439
00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:50.180
you do the same thing.
What drivel, no one should

440
00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:52.550
ever visit this blog. This
is garbage. I want to

441
00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:54.980
go back and like, what
was I writing this throwaway

442
00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:58.040
post? It's like four paragraphs
and some evocative clip art

443
00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:02.000
is just awful, but it's
the top Google result for

444
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.210
some skier, Google, you know,
someone decides to search for

445
00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:07.730
a good. Yeah. And then
they find my blog and

446
00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:10.700
like, yeah. Awesome. Yeah. But
if you can, if you

447
00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:14.860
can pump out 15 posts
a month and that's focusing

448
00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:17.560
on quality, that's amazing. So
the only time that I've

449
00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:21.700
ever blogged that much was
just over a year ago,

450
00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:24.400
I was doing a series
called EDU link where I

451
00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:30.310
rewrote linked to objects from
scratch just for the sake

452
00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:33.190
of it. Yeah, really? Just,
This is the part where

453
00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:34.900
I feel like a phony
now means you're seriously used

454
00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:37.570
to hear what you just
said. Okay. I say just,

455
00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:40.390
just for the sake of
it, to prove a point

456
00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:43.180
that you don't have to
be smart to writing projects

457
00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:47.020
that actually it's the design.
You have to be really

458
00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:50.530
smart to design link. Very,
very smart, but the actual

459
00:24:50.530 --> 00:24:53.050
implementation, how many lines do
you think it would take

460
00:24:53.050 --> 00:24:56.470
to implement where or select
it's about three lines. I

461
00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:59.770
see. It's really smart because
we're, we're standing on the

462
00:24:59.770 --> 00:25:02.770
shoulders of giants and kind
of doing little fingers behind

463
00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:07.450
them, behind their heads because
the compiler's doing a load

464
00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:11.410
of stuff for you. The
language is designed right for

465
00:25:11.410 --> 00:25:15.490
you. And it's really easy.
So I did all of

466
00:25:15.490 --> 00:25:19.600
the standard linked toward objects
operators and found in everything

467
00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:22.840
that I did. There was
something interesting that I hadn't

468
00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:25.330
even thought of before. I'd
sort of taken it on

469
00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:28.720
thinking, okay, the first few
posts will be interesting and

470
00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:31.900
I will eat out the
general patterns and then the

471
00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:35.080
rest will be, yep. This
needs to do X. And

472
00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:38.800
here's the code and we're
done. No, that really speaks

473
00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:41.590
to the value of, I
guess the kids call it

474
00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:45.070
code katas, but it's C
a code kata. K T

475
00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:47.320
a. The idea is that
you, you go through this

476
00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:50.650
motion, that intellectually seems simple,
but when you do it,

477
00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:52.810
you realize that there's a
lot to it. It's just

478
00:25:52.810 --> 00:25:56.050
like in any kind of
a martial art, a simple

479
00:25:56.050 --> 00:26:00.130
movements or karate kid turned
into being complex. You know,

480
00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:02.500
he thinks he's going wax
on wax off and discovers

481
00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:04.480
that he's been describing on
hydrating, how to block things.

482
00:26:04.810 --> 00:26:10.330
The same thing applies in
reimplementing common patterns. One of

483
00:26:10.330 --> 00:26:13.540
the most fun things that
I ever did in college

484
00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:17.080
was an operating systems class.
And I thought I was

485
00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:19.630
going to go and dig
into like mimics or Lennox

486
00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:21.640
or whatever. And the guy
shows up with it one

487
00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:23.860
eight and a half by
11 sheet of paper or

488
00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:27.010
an <inaudible> right for the
English people amongst us. And

489
00:26:27.010 --> 00:26:30.730
he says, here's this assembly
language that I invented. Here's

490
00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:33.400
an example program. And here's
the expected output. I want

491
00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:35.920
you to go and create
a 32 bit machine with

492
00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:38.920
this much memory. And if
you just started describing this

493
00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:41.800
theoretical machine and I'm going
to give you this, this

494
00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:44.730
thing, this text file, and
I want you to execute

495
00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:48.420
it, go write an operating
system. No, he didn't literally

496
00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:51.660
mean like at the bios
level. So he wanted you

497
00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:56.100
to implement a virtualized operating
system. And that was it.

498
00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:59.100
That one sheet of paper
was 12 weeks of class.

499
00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:02.280
Yeah. And I didn't see
sharp. Oh cool. And it

500
00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:03.720
was awesome. I have to,
I still, it was still

501
00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:08.430
on my blog and I
did once I figured it

502
00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:11.040
out and I had a,
I did a virtual memory

503
00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:15.060
swapper. And just to be
silly, I actually swapped out

504
00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:18.620
each bite as an XML
file as single bite. So

505
00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:22.890
it was like open bracket,
bite, close bracket. And then

506
00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:26.730
the bite, just to <inaudible>
that was the storage format

507
00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:28.950
for virtual memory. Swapping was
totally ridiculous just to see

508
00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:31.980
if you could write. Yeah.
And, but I learned more

509
00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:34.770
about like paging and fragment.
I had to make like

510
00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:37.770
a visualizer when I, my,
my heap got fragmented and

511
00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:42.810
keeping track of mapping pointers
and stuff if I had,

512
00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:45.510
but I knew all that
stuff intellectually, but if I

513
00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:48.830
hadn't turned the crank and
actually done it, Absolutely. And

514
00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:50.750
I think that's what a
lot of people have found

515
00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:53.270
about writing as well. So
I've written a book about

516
00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:57.410
C-sharp. I remember when Joe Duffy
was writing concurrent programming on

517
00:27:57.410 --> 00:28:01.370
windows, he blogged and said
exactly the same thing that

518
00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:03.380
I'd been saying. I had
heard other people saying it's

519
00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:06.170
amazing how much you find
you don't know when you

520
00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:10.100
try to explain something to
someone else. So I'm sure,

521
00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:13.160
you know, Joe, he knows
so much about concurrency on

522
00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:15.680
windows, just mind blown. Let's
see the is the same

523
00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:19.130
way. Yeah. And yet When
they try to write it

524
00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:21.980
down and pinpoint stuff, you
can, you find the gaps,

525
00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:24.230
you find stuff that you
didn't know, you didn't know.

526
00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:27.530
And so linked to objects
was the same. So I

527
00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:31.340
took things and virtually every
operator, there was some question

528
00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:35.390
on, is it valid to
optimize a certain thing or

529
00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:38.690
not? And you could argue
it both ways. And maybe

530
00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:42.620
I'd find that linked to
objects did optimize something. And

531
00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:44.450
I would have unit tests
to prove that it was

532
00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:47.870
optimized in a particular way,
which, you know, given the

533
00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:50.840
optimization is meant to not
have side effects as it

534
00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:55.700
were. It's quite tricky to
prove an optimization and prove

535
00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:57.710
that some things weren't optimized
and try to work out

536
00:28:57.710 --> 00:29:00.170
why found a bug in
linked objects at the same

537
00:29:00.170 --> 00:29:04.490
time. So it was, it's
incredible fun, much more so

538
00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:07.730
than I expected. And during
that time, over the Christmas

539
00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:11.480
holidays, I was pumping out
a couple of posts a

540
00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:14.990
day that were very formulaic
in terms of here's the

541
00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:17.690
operator, here's the signature that
we're going to do. Here's

542
00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:19.940
what it needs to achieve.
Cause I wanted it to

543
00:29:20.030 --> 00:29:22.310
end up being a sort
of reference work as well.

544
00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:26.450
Here are the tests we're
going to write and here's

545
00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:29.420
the implementation or the interesting
bits of the implementation. And

546
00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:31.130
I was able to do
a couple of those a

547
00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:33.440
day, but it kind of
bumped me out as well.

548
00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:36.860
It was loads of fun,
but I can't even imagine

549
00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:40.220
being able to write one
post every other day for

550
00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:46.170
a sustained and keep the
quality up. Some days you

551
00:29:46.170 --> 00:29:48.300
just kind of wake up
there's this, this, this old

552
00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:50.550
American cartoon of, you know,
do you know like Dunkin

553
00:29:50.550 --> 00:29:55.200
donuts? Okay. So this is
our great American will be

554
00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:57.540
brought to the, to the
culture is Dunkin donuts, right?

555
00:29:57.610 --> 00:30:01.590
Sorry, Dunkin donuts, Dunkin donuts.
Oh, it's a duck Duncan.

556
00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:03.510
That's a whole different, no,
there's no ducks in this

557
00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:05.640
one. So there's this, there's
this commercial rather than a

558
00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:08.310
cartoon, but a commercial where
in the eighties where there's

559
00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:10.530
this, this man, he looks
like Mario, he's got the

560
00:30:10.530 --> 00:30:13.500
big mustache. And he, he
gets out know like the

561
00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:16.530
commercial starts and it's four
in the morning and the

562
00:30:16.530 --> 00:30:18.210
alarm goes off and he
opens his eyes and he

563
00:30:18.210 --> 00:30:22.200
goes time to make the
donuts. And the idea is

564
00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:23.670
that, you know, he's up
at four in the morning

565
00:30:23.670 --> 00:30:25.980
making the donuts so that
you get up at six

566
00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:28.080
in the morning and the
donuts are ready and that's

567
00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:30.600
this whole thing. He's just
as pathetic, sad sack, but

568
00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:34.290
he's obligated to make the
donuts. But you got to

569
00:30:34.290 --> 00:30:36.630
think of him as this
kind of hero because Hey

570
00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:38.850
man, he's making the donuts
every day for us. Right.

571
00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:41.790
So sometimes you have the
sense of like, you know,

572
00:30:41.790 --> 00:30:44.910
time to blog the.net, whatever,
you know, you're the, you

573
00:30:44.910 --> 00:30:48.750
know, and then that's not
fun. Yeah. But then I'll

574
00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:51.300
read other people's blog posts
and I'll see the font

575
00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:53.640
I'll read the fun that
they're having. And I'll start

576
00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:56.580
to get kind of outside
my comfort zone. Right. And

577
00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:58.800
actually Rob Connery has been
one of those guys where

578
00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:00.630
he's kind of brought some
of the fun into blogging.

579
00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:03.690
He's a little more sassy
and a little bit more

580
00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:07.860
throw a dart at the
elephant than I typically am.

581
00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:10.740
But some of my best
posts for the last six

582
00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:13.350
months have been directly as
a result of being just

583
00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:17.130
a little bit more declarative
and expressing a stronger opinion

584
00:31:17.130 --> 00:31:21.330
about stuff and, you know,
poking Hawaiian that wouldn't necessarily

585
00:31:21.330 --> 00:31:23.430
do. And that makes me
feel less like it's a

586
00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:25.830
slog, right? Yeah. You know,
cause nobody wants to just

587
00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:28.710
crank out the same kind
of nonsense. It's gotta be

588
00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:31.440
fresh. Yeah. And it's gotta
be, I think you really

589
00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:34.080
have to enjoy it yourself
because other people are gonna

590
00:31:34.090 --> 00:31:38.160
see that. You're not exactly.
Exactly. Yeah. I think that's

591
00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:41.670
one thing when people say
that they've enjoyed a session

592
00:31:41.670 --> 00:31:43.770
that I've given us a
conference or whatever. And in

593
00:31:43.770 --> 00:31:46.860
fact, I'm also a Methodist
local preacher bucket back in

594
00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:51.900
the UK. I I'm longing
for someone who's been to

595
00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:54.810
a tech conference to come
to a church that I'm

596
00:31:54.810 --> 00:31:57.390
preaching at one day or
vice versa and sort of

597
00:31:57.390 --> 00:32:00.600
comment on the similarities or
differences. Because I think I,

598
00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:04.110
in some ways preach in
the same way that I

599
00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:09.270
give tech talks, particularly around
I'm enthusiastic. If I can't

600
00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:12.630
find something that I'm absolutely
passionate about, then it's really

601
00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:15.690
difficult. And in fact, I
found that difficult just before

602
00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:18.060
Christmas. So I was preaching
on the last Sunday before

603
00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:22.170
Christmas. And my sermon was
on advent for the tired

604
00:32:22.170 --> 00:32:24.870
Christian, because I was exhausted
at the time. And I

605
00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:26.700
felt it was the one
thing I could actually speak

606
00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:30.150
about honestly. And with some
passion was I'm exhausted at

607
00:32:30.150 --> 00:32:34.740
the moment, but yeah, I
think being passionate about anything

608
00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:37.230
is infectious and it's harder
to do that on a

609
00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:40.070
blog. I think it takes
a gift to do it

610
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:42.770
on a blog. I find
it easier to do in

611
00:32:42.770 --> 00:32:45.790
person. Well, you know, we're
here at code mash at

612
00:32:45.790 --> 00:32:47.470
the code mash conference. You
can check it out. Code

613
00:32:47.470 --> 00:32:49.660
match.org. We're in Ohio. And
I was walking in the

614
00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:51.970
hallways actually just a few
minutes before I met you.

615
00:32:52.510 --> 00:32:55.570
And this young man came
up and said, this is

616
00:32:55.570 --> 00:32:59.710
I'm an, I'm an adjunct
professor pitched spare time kind

617
00:32:59.710 --> 00:33:02.380
of professor on the side
at the local college. Do

618
00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:04.330
you have any tips? He's
asking me this, do you

619
00:33:04.330 --> 00:33:06.670
have any tips on speaking
to young people or college

620
00:33:06.670 --> 00:33:11.920
students? And I said, encouraged
them to be enthusiastic or

621
00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:14.380
to leave, right? Because I've
just, if they're going to

622
00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:16.330
come in and sleep or
they just need the need,

623
00:33:16.330 --> 00:33:20.740
the credit kick them out.
Right. Because in high school,

624
00:33:20.770 --> 00:33:23.440
you, and in these, in
America, the high school teacher

625
00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:25.630
is graded on how well
the teachers do and how

626
00:33:25.690 --> 00:33:27.270
do I to be on
how well the children do

627
00:33:27.850 --> 00:33:29.710
in high school that teachers
are graded on how well

628
00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:32.710
the children do. So a
child fails. It is perceived

629
00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:35.140
as a failure on the
part of the teacher in

630
00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:38.290
college. Man, they'll fail you
just for fun. You know,

631
00:33:38.650 --> 00:33:41.410
I get the paid no
matter whether y'all get F's

632
00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:43.360
or other, you all get
A's. So if you said,

633
00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:45.280
if you don't want to
be passionate, if you don't

634
00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:48.700
want to be excited, if
you're not excited about software,

635
00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:50.830
excited about computers, if you're
not at home taking apart

636
00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:56.140
your clock radio and disassembling
the toaster and making it

637
00:33:56.170 --> 00:33:59.890
wifi enabled, Find something that
will do Just get out

638
00:33:59.890 --> 00:34:01.960
of here. Cause why not
be excited? I have to

639
00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:05.560
confess. So I read maths
at university, but there were

640
00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:09.070
some topics that were less
interesting than others. And I

641
00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:13.540
think I missed most of
my geometry of surfaces lectures

642
00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:16.690
in order to go to
the classics faculty and study.

643
00:34:16.690 --> 00:34:18.250
I was in my third
year and I went to

644
00:34:18.250 --> 00:34:20.530
the first year philosophy lectures.
Cause they were just more

645
00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:23.800
fun. I think I was
probably the only one there

646
00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:25.750
who was having a load
of fun because it was

647
00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:27.440
something I didn't need to
do. It was, I was

648
00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:30.220
just there for fun. And
it, it busts me to

649
00:34:30.220 --> 00:34:32.890
see all these people going,
Oh, I should also be

650
00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:35.710
it's philosophy. It's great. I
was able to bring some

651
00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:38.560
maths to that and ask
sort of bizarre questions that

652
00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:41.740
would only come from a
math mode talking about philosophy,

653
00:34:42.850 --> 00:34:45.190
but it, it was great.
And I, I don't regret

654
00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:48.100
skipping those geometry of surfaces
lectures at all. I'm sure

655
00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:50.500
they were great for what
they were, but it wasn't

656
00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:52.570
my cup of tea. Well,
that's the thing that I

657
00:34:52.570 --> 00:34:54.910
want to figure out how
to give that to my

658
00:34:54.910 --> 00:34:58.390
kids because I keep coming
in contact with young people

659
00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:04.750
that are just dispassionate, right?
Passive, passive, just, just life

660
00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:08.410
is happening to them. Yeah.
I mean, my message in

661
00:35:08.410 --> 00:35:12.880
everything is get out there
and here are the tools

662
00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:16.750
and do something you are
powerful, right? That's my message.

663
00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:20.020
Whether I'm teaching college students,
high school students volunteering, or

664
00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:22.750
whether I'm talking to adults
at code mash, you are

665
00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:26.950
powerful. You know, your crown
has been paid for, put

666
00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:31.210
it on. And when people
aren't excited about that, I

667
00:35:31.210 --> 00:35:36.370
wonder were you born passive
and dispassionate? What can you

668
00:35:36.370 --> 00:35:39.210
go find something you can
be excited about? So excited

669
00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:43.130
that you're afraid you might
be a phony, Right? Yeah.

670
00:35:43.610 --> 00:35:47.630
Because there is something that
when you're passionate, you can

671
00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:53.600
feel, you can usually see
that there is more, there's

672
00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:55.640
always more, you can see
there's something else coming up,

673
00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:57.950
something else coming up, which
means, Hey, I have to

674
00:35:57.950 --> 00:36:00.140
suck at this. If, if
I'm so far behind the

675
00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:02.630
curve, even if that's actually
the bleeding edge of the

676
00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:06.920
curve. Exactly. But because of
the passion, the passion takes

677
00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:11.720
you to Excel and feel
that you're not excelling at

678
00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:14.330
the same time. I think
one can drive the other

679
00:36:14.330 --> 00:36:17.720
so long as it stays
healthy. Yeah. Someone was teasing

680
00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:19.670
me about coming. I skipped
some parties last night and

681
00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:21.920
I came back and I
worked on my talk and

682
00:36:21.950 --> 00:36:24.020
like, what are you doing?
I said, you're Scott Hanselman.

683
00:36:24.410 --> 00:36:26.540
And like, you have no
I'm in a complete panic.

684
00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:29.270
You know, this talk is
going to suck. If I

685
00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:30.830
don't go on practice. And
I was up till three

686
00:36:30.830 --> 00:36:34.100
in the morning, Oh man.
And this time zone, I

687
00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:35.990
was up till three in
the morning practicing because I

688
00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:39.620
didn't want it to suck.
Right. And I've given talks

689
00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:43.310
for 20 years, but each
one of them, everyone knows

690
00:36:43.310 --> 00:36:47.810
my process. Abject panic and
terror is a great way

691
00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:51.320
to become really creative. Yeah.
Well, so after my talk

692
00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:54.530
with bill this morning, we
had a chap come up

693
00:36:54.530 --> 00:36:56.990
to us, come up to
me and say, it would

694
00:36:56.990 --> 00:36:59.450
really help me. If you
would tell me that you

695
00:36:59.450 --> 00:37:03.470
had to put work into
that because otherwise he would

696
00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:05.480
feel a failure that, that,
Yeah, he would be a

697
00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:08.930
funny, because John just shows
up, Well, he got this

698
00:37:08.930 --> 00:37:11.750
idea that probably it was
true that people put in

699
00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:15.260
a lot of effort, but
if it wasn't, then he

700
00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:17.660
might as well go home
because he had to work

701
00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:21.170
really hard to do anything.
And that's fine. That's absolutely

702
00:37:21.170 --> 00:37:22.880
fine. And if you are,
I gave you as an

703
00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:26.630
example that you are consummate
speaker. And I knew that

704
00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:29.120
the talk would have gone
brilliantly and that it wouldn't

705
00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:31.640
have looked like there was
effort involved at all because

706
00:37:31.970 --> 00:37:34.730
that's how good you are
at doing it. But that

707
00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:37.250
is because you've put in
all the effort beforehand I'm

708
00:37:37.250 --> 00:37:39.830
bill and I practiced, I'm
sure a lot less than

709
00:37:39.830 --> 00:37:42.320
you did. I heard you've
been doing this thing for

710
00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:44.240
weeks and weeks though. I
talked to Diane and she

711
00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:47.510
said, you guys been practicing
remotely, Some slides and a

712
00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:50.300
bit of code and stuff,
but we didn't rehearse anything.

713
00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:53.840
We didn't rehearse the switchovers.
And who was going to

714
00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:55.760
do, we had an idea
of who would do which

715
00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:58.370
bit. It'd be interesting to
look at the notes afterwards

716
00:37:58.370 --> 00:38:01.370
and see how accurately that
turned out. But no, it

717
00:38:01.370 --> 00:38:04.610
wasn't, you, we didn't go
somewhere and record an example

718
00:38:04.610 --> 00:38:06.920
and then pick it apart
and all the things, there's

719
00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:11.900
a brilliant book. Confessions of
a public speaker. Oh, is

720
00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:15.350
that Scott Burkin? Yes. Oh,
Scott Burke and everything. He writes

721
00:38:15.350 --> 00:38:18.260
this great by everything. That's
got Birkin rights And it's

722
00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:21.350
lovely. And I promised myself,
after reading this book, I

723
00:38:21.350 --> 00:38:24.140
will start rehearsing. When I
do talks, I will start

724
00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:26.900
rehearsing to a camera. I
will watch it. And to

725
00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:29.600
this day I still haven't.
I feel completely, It's a

726
00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:32.090
really amazing thing if you
do. And I honestly, I

727
00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:34.130
three in the morning, three
30, when I went to

728
00:38:34.130 --> 00:38:37.420
sleep, I closed my eyes
and I started kind of

729
00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:40.210
thinking to myself in a
focused, like, as if I

730
00:38:40.210 --> 00:38:41.980
were talking to myself, I
don't talk to myself. Right.

731
00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:45.040
I was thinking to myself,
hi, I'm Scott Hanselman. I

732
00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:47.980
worked at Microsoft. I was
literally, as I was going

733
00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:50.170
to sleep, I was saying
it, I was, I could

734
00:38:50.170 --> 00:38:53.200
feel the sub vocalization. I
could feel the, my tongue

735
00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:55.930
moving in my mouth. I
was sure. And I converse

736
00:38:55.930 --> 00:39:00.340
like that, but I've never
rehearsed and done a web

737
00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:03.010
com. Oh you should. Yeah,
I know I should. But

738
00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:04.750
you're gonna realize what you
do with your hands and

739
00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:06.490
what you do. And this
is to do with being

740
00:39:06.490 --> 00:39:09.070
phony. Cause I hate watching
myself and I hate listening

741
00:39:09.070 --> 00:39:11.440
to myself and I know
that it would make me

742
00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:14.020
better and I, I can't
quite face it yet. So

743
00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:15.640
the fact that you said
it as well as the

744
00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:18.910
other Scott, maybe it's a
Scott thing, but yeah, I

745
00:39:18.910 --> 00:39:21.070
should definitely do it. It
will take you to the

746
00:39:21.070 --> 00:39:24.430
next level and honestly, let
someone else rip you apart.

747
00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:27.370
Right. But let them watch
you or if you part,

748
00:39:27.370 --> 00:39:29.680
but the great part is
that if you've ever done

749
00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:33.280
theater, yes. It's just theater.
Right? I mean, you, you

750
00:39:33.370 --> 00:39:36.060
it's blocking, make sure you're
facing the audience, you know,

751
00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:38.650
annunciate throw your voice against
the back of the room.

752
00:39:38.650 --> 00:39:40.660
You know, all that stuff.
That's just all classic kind

753
00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:43.330
of theater training type stuff.
Oh yeah. Yeah. Same things

754
00:39:43.330 --> 00:39:47.340
apply. Don't don't mean, and
I make the mistakes. Like

755
00:39:47.650 --> 00:39:49.780
I just did this video,
this speaker, how to speak

756
00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:53.110
video with, with Rob Connery.
And in the video I

757
00:39:53.110 --> 00:39:55.330
explained, you know, don't touch
your face, keep your hands

758
00:39:55.330 --> 00:39:57.400
out of your pocket. A
couple of people emailed me

759
00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:58.870
after they watched the video
and they're like, but you

760
00:39:58.870 --> 00:40:01.840
touched your face. Like within
five minutes of here. See,

761
00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:03.370
you know what I mean?
I'm always going to have

762
00:40:03.370 --> 00:40:05.260
to work on that. I
don't like I'm aware of

763
00:40:05.290 --> 00:40:09.130
certain phrases that I'll use
just over and over again.

764
00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:11.710
And sometimes I'm aware of
it. I'm sure there are

765
00:40:11.830 --> 00:40:14.200
other phrases that I'm not
aware on reusing the whole

766
00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:19.420
time, but yeah, one day
I just need to work

767
00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:22.000
out a time that I
can afford that amount of

768
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.420
self-loathing and get back on,
back on the horse. I

769
00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:27.340
love that we have equal
amounts of self-loading because it

770
00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:29.200
drives us forward. Thank you
so much, John skeet for

771
00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:31.780
like you it's beautiful. Oh,
this has been a very

772
00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:34.060
special episode of Hanselminutes I
think. And we'll see you

773
00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:34.750
again next week.
