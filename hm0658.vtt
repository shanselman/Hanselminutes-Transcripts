E R I k.com/hanselman Friends

17
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.560
is Scott Hanselman. This is
another Sort of Hansel minutes

18
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.080
today. I'm talking with Nythia
Ruff. She's the head of

19
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.350
the open source office at
Comcast and also an at

20
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.520
large director at the Linux
foundation. She has both MBA

21
00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.490
and a master's in computer
science. Thanks so much for

22
00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.910
chatting with me today. My
pleasure, Scott, thanks for having

23
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.720
me. So you work for
Comcast, but you're the head

24
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.540
of the open source office.
And I think for people

25
00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.050
who use Comcast as their
provider for, you know, for

26
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.040
television, for internet don't necessarily
think big giant, you know,

27
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.950
cable company and open source,
but you there's quite an

28
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.930
office there. Absolutely. In fact,
Comcast has been using open

29
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.710
source since the beginning of
2000, when it started switching

30
00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.510
over from, you know, just
consuming proprietary products and operating

31
00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.550
them to actually creating software.
For example, the <inaudible> set

32
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.450
top box operating system that
all of us use and

33
00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.170
the voice remote is powered
by software that was created

34
00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.460
at Comcast and open source
is the way we innovate

35
00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.880
today at Comcast. Wow. I
would have, I guess I

36
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.070
just assumed, and I think
when we, when I think

37
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.610
of a quote unquote traditional
company, like a regular company,

38
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.310
I just assumed that they
did everything in house. But

39
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.580
if you realize the scope
of something so large, that

40
00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.160
they would need operating systems
to run the boxes and

41
00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.560
the switches and the networks,
like it would be silly

42
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.560
to build all of that
from scratch Precisely. It is

43
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.080
one of the largest networks
in the country, as you

44
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.280
can imagine, and everything from
the content distribution network, which

45
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.060
is Apache traffic control, which
we created and donated to

46
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.750
the Apache foundation to the
set top box software, which

47
00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.350
is based on the Octo
project, for example, which is

48
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:04.180
an embedded Linux distribution to
other projects inside the company

49
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.980
and contributions to things like
OpenStack and Kubernetes really fuels

50
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.750
the, the business. It is
no longer if you will,

51
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.660
a non IP or a
non digital business, it's a

52
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.650
completely a digital business. And
we take pride in being

53
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.550
very involved as a software
development company in creating all

54
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.120
of these solutions. So you
said that they've been doing

55
00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.900
this since 2000, that's like
20 years of opensource almost

56
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.120
Indeed. Indeed. In fact, I
work for the chiefs chief

57
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.380
software architect for the company
and John Moore. And John tells

58
00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.980
the story of how back
in 2005 or six, I

59
00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.800
think he was contributing to
HTTP at Apache. And that's

60
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.550
when he realized that we
needed to have open source

61
00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.330
policy in place and open
source advisory council that would

62
00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:02.250
approve things to contribute back
to open source. And, and

63
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.730
frankly there's been a ton
of consumption and we were,

64
00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.560
I think, doing about 13
contributions a year around 2013.

65
00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.700
And then this year we
will almost hit 200 contributions

66
00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.820
of original projects, but also
say feature enhancements and bug

67
00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.550
fixes and things of that
nature to open source project.

68
00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.930
Wow. Okay. So when you
think of a quote unquote

69
00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.650
traditional company moving towards open
source is a, I assume

70
00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.830
that in 2000 there wasn't
like instantly a, an open

71
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.430
source practice office and policies
in place. I know that

72
00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.640
I've been at Microsoft now
for 10 years, and I

73
00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.860
feel like it's only the
last five to six years

74
00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.070
that we've actually gotten our
open source ducks in a

75
00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:52.650
row. That's exactly correct. Scott,
many, many companies start out

76
00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.090
with a few engineers. Part-time
kind of advising and acting

77
00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.540
as mentors and support to
other engineers in the company.

78
00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.140
And the legal team does
part-time open source, you know,

79
00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:10.230
licensed checking CLA checking or
approving contributions. And then you

80
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.840
reach a scale and you
reach a volume where you

81
00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.440
say, this is not scalable.
This is not, you know,

82
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.370
systematic. This is not something
that can work across the

83
00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.850
company, especially when you have
thousands of developers doing work

84
00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.570
and you have a more
and more consumption contribution and

85
00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:32.010
creation, right? So you then
realize that you need to

86
00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:35.760
start a dedicated center of
excellence or an office. If

87
00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.450
you will often call the
open source program office. That

88
00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:43.110
seems to be the standard
term in the industry. And

89
00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.460
you start that and that
helps you then have someone

90
00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.580
who wakes up in the
morning, thinking about open source,

91
00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.570
puts consistent practices across the
company, acts as a buffer

92
00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:58.640
between engineering and legal, if
you will puts policies in

93
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.150
place boots, processes, and tooling
and automation in place. And

94
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.810
I think Microsoft open source
program office does a fantastic

95
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.930
job given the scale that
you guys are and the

96
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.230
work that you do, just
like us, the open source

97
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:16.600
program office makes a huge
impact. Is there also education

98
00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.240
programs? Cause one of the
things I bumped into recently

99
00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:23.320
with a large company whose
name we would, we would

100
00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:27.310
recognize was that they, they
had a young engineer who

101
00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:31.420
accidentally, or for whatever reason,
copy pasted, some code. And

102
00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:33.640
it got a little ahead
of them to the point

103
00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.970
where it appeared that they
had taken, you know, 40,

104
00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:40.900
50 source code files and
basically swapped out the copyrights

105
00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:45.250
and changed namespaces when we
on its, on its face,

106
00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:47.290
that would have been quite
a dramatic thing, but it

107
00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:49.660
turned out, it was ultimately
an education issue of someone

108
00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:52.900
was prototyping. And really didn't
realize that they were pushing

109
00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:57.730
into, into the open world.
And that was all worked

110
00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:00.520
out. But when we dug
into it, this large company

111
00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.710
really didn't have a formal
open source office and had

112
00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:08.440
no education for a new
engineer. That's so true. Education

113
00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:13.660
is the key. We, for
example, have a mandatory training

114
00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:18.910
program that every single engineer,
whether you're a contractor or

115
00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:21.610
a full time employee with
the company has to take,

116
00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:25.390
it's a very, very short
program. It's about 20 minutes,

117
00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.300
but it gives you the
essence of some of the

118
00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.030
privileges that you get, but
open source, but also some

119
00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:33.910
of the obligations, some of
the issues that you need

120
00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:36.730
to watch out for. And
then we have a very,

121
00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:41.560
very active Slack channel, which
helps us fend questions that

122
00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:44.590
come up, you know, things
exactly like this. I'm about

123
00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:47.050
to do this. Should I
do this or not? Or

124
00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:50.710
who should I contact to
get this reviewed? The other

125
00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:53.260
thing we have done and
many companies do is, you

126
00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.200
know, set up a portal
or a website somewhere, which

127
00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:00.550
allows you to, if you
will act as a single

128
00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:04.630
source of information. Yeah. We
at, at Microsoft and at

129
00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:08.650
previous companies that I've had
have often bumped into high

130
00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:13.060
level executives that weren't into
the idea, what, what do

131
00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:15.040
we tell them? What do
we tell the audience who's

132
00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.470
listening to this podcast who
says, well, it's wonderful that,

133
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.260
that, you know, she runs
the opensource office at Comcast,

134
00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:24.130
but I work at big
co and we're open source

135
00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:26.860
hostile, like in my boss
would never allow open source

136
00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:32.320
at our company. That's, that's
very, very prevalent, less. So

137
00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:37.360
these days, and essentially what
I would say is one

138
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.930
of the first areas that
that executives get is the

139
00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:44.620
legal aspect. And the fact
that the risks that come,

140
00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:47.500
if you don't comply with
open source licenses and that

141
00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:50.350
we have an obligation as
a company to abide by

142
00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:54.580
the license obligations and, you
know, pointing out the risk

143
00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:58.440
of a shipment of products
or the fact that you

144
00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:02.010
can have a PR issue
with the company or a

145
00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:08.100
certain other, you know, issues
with the copyright noncompliance gets

146
00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:11.460
their attention. But the more
important thing is they start

147
00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:16.230
understanding how this can speed
innovation, cut, time to market,

148
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:19.260
because you have access to
source code. You can take

149
00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.770
advantage of a number of
different projects out there that

150
00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:27.930
will help you get innovation
done faster. They also start

151
00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:32.580
understanding that this is the
new way companies are innovating.

152
00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:38.940
They work across companies, they
collaborate on problems and get

153
00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:42.840
more work done through external
development and external engineering. Then

154
00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:45.270
if we could do it
ourselves and that we could

155
00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:49.530
use our scarce resources to
focus on, you know, differentiation

156
00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:54.180
or doing things that are
very uniquely us. And this

157
00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:58.140
definitely gets their attention, the
business benefits of open source,

158
00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:01.410
the innovation aspects of open
source. Plus the fact that

159
00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:04.650
we do need to be
a good citizen and respect

160
00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:08.240
the licenses. So how do
we, how do we, how

161
00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:11.390
do you have a, a
little person like the rank

162
00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:14.510
and file? Well, who has
just come to a company

163
00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:16.790
and they're excited about open
source, but then they discover

164
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:20.510
their company isn't so friendly.
How do you gently manage

165
00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:23.720
up and encourage people to
point them, to companies with

166
00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:27.920
successful open source offices? There
are so many wonderful resources

167
00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:31.820
these days, for example, the
Tudou group, which is to

168
00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:37.130
do group.org is a fantastic
organization of open source program

169
00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:43.040
managers like myself across various
companies. And we realized that

170
00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:46.700
many new companies are coming
on board, starting new offices,

171
00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:49.820
or perhaps they're so small
that they are not able

172
00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:52.310
to start offices, but they
have part time people who

173
00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:56.240
need this kind of support
and help. We have guides.

174
00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:00.920
We have case studies. We
have an organization Slack channel

175
00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:03.290
that you can join. I
think that's one of the

176
00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:08.630
best resources that I have
found the second resource for

177
00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:11.720
people who want to convince
someone or who want to,

178
00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:14.060
you know, understand a few
things that they need to

179
00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:17.240
do in their open source
office is to look at

180
00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:20.570
some of the best practices
out there. Google, for example,

181
00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:24.230
started an open source program
office many, many, many moons

182
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:28.430
ago, Bray before all of
us did. And they have

183
00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:32.420
actually open sourced all of
their documents, their processes, their

184
00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:36.680
policies, et cetera. And you
can go check out Google

185
00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:39.290
open source office, and you
can find a lot of

186
00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:43.190
documents there as well. You
can attend an open source

187
00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:46.970
event, either run by the
Lennox foundation or OSC on

188
00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:50.510
or the, to do group
or, you know, all things

189
00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:53.680
open and you can find
an open source program like

190
00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:56.740
myself. We have very happy
to mentor and support and

191
00:11:56.740 --> 00:12:00.220
help other companies who are
starting their own open source

192
00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:04.410
offices. Do you think sometimes
that, that traditional companies think

193
00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:06.580
that open source is going
to have them lose their,

194
00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:09.900
their IP, that they're going
to go and build something

195
00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:12.690
and then that will give
their competition an edge and

196
00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:14.670
then they stay out of
opensource because of that fear?

197
00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:19.170
Yes. Yes. In a previous
company that I was with

198
00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:23.670
those who don't know the
benefits of open source often

199
00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:26.400
kind of think, why am
I sharing this with others?

200
00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:30.060
You know, I'm giving my
competition the benefit of the

201
00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:34.410
software that I have created.
And then they start realizing

202
00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:37.950
that a, they benefit a
lot from other people's innovations

203
00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:41.070
too. And, and this is
the right thing to do

204
00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:44.640
to give back. And they
also realize that carrying the

205
00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:48.210
burden of a Fort project,
if you will, you know,

206
00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:52.080
this customization patch that they're
carrying is a heavy burden.

207
00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:54.900
It puts a lot of
technical debt on them to

208
00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:59.820
integrate it back with open
source main, main line, every

209
00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:02.670
single time they need to
move forward to another release.

210
00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:07.410
They also start realizing that
they can't partake of security

211
00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:11.130
patches, for example, which are
usually available on the latest

212
00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:15.270
release, if they are stuck
behind in an old release

213
00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:18.930
and in a forked release.
And frankly they start kind

214
00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:22.080
of doing a better job
thinking through what is it

215
00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:25.980
that is our competitive advantage
and differentiation and what is

216
00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:29.340
standard. And nine times out
of 10, you'll find that

217
00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:32.940
most things are pretty standard
stuff that are okay to

218
00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:36.750
open source and that not
are not patentable or IP

219
00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:40.140
or secret sauce. Yeah. That's
such an interesting point because

220
00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:42.000
I think so often people
say I'm going to start

221
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.770
a company and then they'll
say, Oh, look, here's a

222
00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:46.230
complete operating system. I'll just
make a copy of that.

223
00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:48.990
And like you said, I'll
fork it. And they don't

224
00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:53.210
realize that now, rather than
joining the community, they tried

225
00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:56.730
to copy it and then
reproduce it internally. And now

226
00:13:56.730 --> 00:13:59.160
they're off on a fork
that they're going to be

227
00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:02.640
tied to forever because they
simply wouldn't join the community

228
00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:07.230
Precisely. And the very, very
benefit of joining a community

229
00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:12.180
is the shared innovation. The
fact that, you know, there

230
00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:15.090
are use cases that you
could never have thought about,

231
00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:19.920
or there are competencies and
areas that the project grows

232
00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:24.680
that you could never innovate
on your own. And it's,

233
00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:27.750
it's a huge advantage to
be a part of a

234
00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:31.170
community moving things forward. And
some of the challenges we're

235
00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:35.880
facing today are such big
challenges and such interconnected challenges

236
00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:39.270
that one company alone can
do it. So this is

237
00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:44.700
a huge, huge part of
engineering teams. Innovation. Today, I

238
00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:49.350
am part of the software
strategy and transformation group in

239
00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:54.350
Comcast technology products and customer
experience team and via the

240
00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:59.060
technical engine, if you will,
behind the entire cable business.

241
00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:02.960
And we also support and
help our brothers and sisters

242
00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:07.910
in NBC universal Dreamworks, the
Comcast venture steam, et cetera,

you think about licensing? Let's

255
00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:05.200
just use a theoretical set
top box, some theoretical and

256
00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:07.960
not necessarily Comcast. Someone could
say, all right, well, here's

257
00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:09.790
a great operating system for
a beginning of a set

258
00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:12.640
top box, but we're going
to put our special sauce

259
00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:14.140
on it. And we're going
to have our great interface

260
00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:15.430
and we're going to innovate
at the T at the

261
00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:19.270
high level, but the licensing,
whether it be MIT or

262
00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:23.380
whether it be something more
like GPL that wants improvements

263
00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:26.710
pushed back into the product,
a company might say, well,

264
00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:28.810
this license isn't friendly because
they're going to want our

265
00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:31.660
special sauce. And that's going
to take away our competitive

266
00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:37.930
advantage. Yes. What would companies
are doing is using more

267
00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:41.110
business friend day licenses these
days, such as a patchy,

268
00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:45.790
which helps them, you know,
both protect their IP, but

269
00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:49.210
also make it available in
the form of source code

270
00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:52.660
so that others can use
it contribute to it. The

271
00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:57.220
challenge sometimes with permissive licenses
is that people are not

272
00:16:57.220 --> 00:17:00.580
obligated to contribute back, right?
So you have to work

273
00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:04.870
harder at building community at
convincing people as to why

274
00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:09.010
it is important to contribute
back. And frankly, I think

275
00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:14.860
the, the, the competencies that
come with open sourcing is

276
00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:19.690
that you think more clearly
about your IP, your competitive

277
00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:23.770
advantage, where that line begins
and ends and where things

278
00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:28.150
are commodity or things are
standardized. You also start thinking

279
00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:32.230
more strategically about such things
as is this a space

280
00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:35.230
that I want to build
an ecosystem around, or is

281
00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:37.030
there a gap in this
space? And I want to

282
00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:40.930
introduce a new standard. If
you will, to me open

283
00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:44.170
source has become the new
way of creating defacto standards.

284
00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:48.700
You don't typically go through
standards bodies anymore where you

285
00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:51.870
would write specs for years
and years and years, and

286
00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:55.590
then you would, you know,
convert that into an implementation.

287
00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:59.970
Now you're, you're actually implementing
and through implementation, you're creating

288
00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:03.110
a standard. Yeah, that's so
interesting. And I'd also had

289
00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:06.380
never really thought about the
idea that having open source

290
00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:09.650
in your organization is a
forcing function to make you

291
00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:12.830
think about your business and
remind you, why are we

292
00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:14.630
in business and what it
is? What is it that

293
00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:17.810
we're selling here? Precisely in
fact, the success of an

294
00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:22.310
opensource office really depends upon
how well aligned you are

295
00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:26.570
to your business and understanding
what the drivers for your

296
00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:30.530
business are. And hence which
open source project makes sense

297
00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:33.560
for you to be involved
in how you need to

298
00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:37.700
build the, the drivers in
your open source office, if

299
00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:41.930
you will, to the business
objectives of the company. What

300
00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:45.110
I did at the opensource
office at SanDisk, where I

301
00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:48.650
was before is very, very
different than what I do

302
00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:52.430
from an open source office
at Comcast. Yes, there are

303
00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:56.840
some, you know, similar functions,
but the kind of communities

304
00:18:56.840 --> 00:19:00.770
I'm involved in, the kind
of projects we release, the

305
00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:06.290
kind of competencies I'm building
inside the company are uniquely

306
00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:10.490
created to help Comcast achieve
its business objectives. And, and

307
00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:13.430
that's one of the things
an open source program manager

308
00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:17.210
has to remember is to
balance the company objectives with

309
00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:20.690
community objectives all time at
all times, and to make

310
00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:25.100
sure that they are doing
right by both parties. How

311
00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:28.430
does one decide it at
a large company, whether they

312
00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:32.120
should put effort into open
sourcing something, for example, Microsoft

313
00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:37.370
open sourced, Microsoft dos earlier
this week, version two or

314
00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:39.800
one. So all the original
source code. And I think

315
00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:42.050
it was just a historical
kind of a fun thing

316
00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:43.610
to look at. I don't
think it's going to move

317
00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:47.420
the world forward. It's just
interesting, but that would have

318
00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:50.720
required effort. There was a
lawyer, there was paperwork. Like

319
00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:54.770
they could have just not
done that. What's what's to

320
00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:58.220
say Comcast, wouldn't just say,
who has the energy? Let's

321
00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:01.130
not even bother open-sourcing this
or that. It is so

322
00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:07.640
interesting that open sourcing a
project, many, many questions on

323
00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:10.040
the form that we ask
the engineers to fill out.

324
00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:12.920
You know, actually it's quite
a short form. One of

325
00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:16.280
the questions often is what's
the business reason why you're

326
00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:20.570
open sourcing this. And increasingly
one of the business seasons

327
00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:24.830
that I see is I
want to be transparent about

328
00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:27.620
the kind of work that
we do, such that I

329
00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:30.560
can attract developers to the
company. I want to show

330
00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:33.740
them the exciting things that
we're doing so that we

331
00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:38.150
can recruit people more effectively.
And this is a tactic

332
00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:42.230
that many, many companies are
using, where they open source

333
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:46.610
projects and people get involved.
They can cherry pick the

334
00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:50.620
developers that I involved in
the project. They already have

335
00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:53.530
the competencies, they know the
kind of work the company

336
00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:57.580
is doing. So that's become
a, a big driver. Clearly

337
00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:02.560
the other drivers are, this
is a project that I

338
00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:06.550
need to grow and I
need additional competencies or additional

339
00:21:06.550 --> 00:21:11.020
use cases. I need other
people involved in this. There

340
00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:15.040
are cases where, you know,
companies may say, I just

341
00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:19.360
want to open source this
because it benefits the world.

342
00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:22.810
I, it benefited me. It
was useful for me. And

343
00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:25.420
B think that, you know,
other people would also benefit

344
00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:29.020
from this. And so there
are various business reasons we

345
00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:33.850
hear increasingly though, recruitment brand
of a company from a

346
00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:38.050
technology perspective. For example, you
know, as you said in

347
00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:41.320
your introduction, often, people don't
think of us as a

348
00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:47.470
technology company, but when you
look@comcastdotgithub.io, you see that via

349
00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:52.270
contributing, you know, upwards of
200 projects. And we have

350
00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:55.420
a wide brunt open source
community. We have policies with

351
00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:59.110
support engineers working with open
source. It makes them realize

352
00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:02.770
that we are a technology
company, a software development company.

353
00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:06.030
And are you finding that
people will find out about

354
00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:08.130
the open source software at
Comcast? And they'll say, Oh,

355
00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:10.800
I want to work there
because they work on this

356
00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:13.830
project or they made that,
that, that, that thing happened.

357
00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:18.000
Absolutely have you. I was
at Apache con last week

358
00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:24.480
and we talked about our
Apache traffic control server, which

359
00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:28.560
we opened sourced some years
ago. And when people realize

360
00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:31.950
that, you know, if they
want to work on a

361
00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:36.360
project that is at the
scale that the CDN Apache

362
00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:40.170
traffic control is that things
like 30 petabytes of data

363
00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:43.620
that moved through this every
single day. I think something

364
00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:48.750
like 1.5 libraries of Congress
worth of data every, you

365
00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:51.540
know, minute or something like
that. It, it, it really

366
00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:55.380
kind of stuns you that
you can then take your

367
00:22:55.380 --> 00:23:00.660
opensource skills and work at
scale and do interesting things

368
00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:03.630
that you could never have
done, you know, on just

369
00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:06.930
a, an open source project
outside the company. So you

370
00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:09.510
can just take those same
skills and apply it to

371
00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:15.510
a commercial application that is
very exciting and very innovating.

372
00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:18.870
Yeah. And it's a really,
it's a, if you haven't

373
00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:21.210
been to Comcast, I get
hub out. It is a

374
00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:25.260
very large site with a
lot of different projects and

375
00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:28.050
they are supper. This is
me being surprised that these

376
00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:32.700
are surprisingly generic, right? It's
about moving things from place

377
00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:35.190
to place, which is the
business that Comcast is in.

378
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.250
And these are things that
you could pick up and

379
00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:41.430
get involved in and incorporate
into your projects. And you

380
00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:44.250
know, that they work because
they are used in such

381
00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:50.600
massive scale. Exactly. And, and,
and Facebook says the same

382
00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:56.780
thing, which is that they
usually put out things that

383
00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:59.900
they use in their own
data centers. And that's what

384
00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:05.360
we do. Things like trickster,
which is permittees dashboard acceleration

385
00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:09.560
program, we've using it inside
to accelerate our own dashboards.

386
00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:11.480
And we said, you know,
I think this is going

387
00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:15.320
to be useful to somebody
else. Why no DNS, which

388
00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:17.990
is DNS as a service,
it's something that we use.

389
00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:19.940
And we said, I think
it can be used by

390
00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:23.810
somebody else. It's also good
for us to see these

391
00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:28.880
projects become, you know, more
mainstream become part of, you

392
00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:36.050
know, cloud native foundation or
stacks at cloud renders because

393
00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:40.850
it benefits everyone. And it
also allows this to become

394
00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:43.730
supported by, you know, a
lot more people than just

395
00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:48.310
dependent upon one company. What
about the role of grants

396
00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:52.570
and in innovation funds to
move things forward as that,

397
00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:54.250
how does that move things
forward for the company? I

398
00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:56.980
could see how granting money
moves things forward for a

399
00:24:56.980 --> 00:25:01.210
project. I'm so glad you
looked at our page and

400
00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:05.320
notice that we do innovation
grants. There are various ways

401
00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:08.530
to support research at universities
and also of course, open

402
00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:13.720
source projects. And the field
that support can come in.

403
00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:15.940
The form of money support
can come in the form

404
00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:20.080
of code contribution. We do
a lot of evangelization sponsorship

405
00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:22.510
of programs. I'll give you
a specific example of a

406
00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:26.620
grant that helped. We saw
that there were a couple

407
00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:31.540
of open source projects that
was struggling financially, and their

408
00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:35.110
maintainers were not able to,
you know, spend full time

409
00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:37.900
on the project because they
needed to make a living

410
00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:42.370
as well. So we gave
a $60,000 grant to a

411
00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:47.080
project thereby allowing the project
to keep the maintainer on

412
00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:49.720
full time and being able
to, you know, do the

413
00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:54.090
work. There was another project
where we donated money and,

414
00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:56.920
and this does not come
with any purse strings or,

415
00:25:57.250 --> 00:26:00.670
you know, any agenda. It
just is purely to maintain

416
00:26:00.670 --> 00:26:04.510
projects that we care about.
We depend upon. And so

417
00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:08.050
does the world, And, and
these, this is quite organized.

418
00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:10.750
Like I know that some
companies will give a grant

419
00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:13.750
here or there, but you've
put together an entire innovation

420
00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:18.850
fund website@innovationfund.comcast.com where people can
apply for grants, check on

421
00:26:18.850 --> 00:26:20.680
their grants, see the status
of them and know whether

422
00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:22.480
or not it's going to
happen. And I've seen people

423
00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:24.610
take off the summer or
take off a year to

424
00:26:24.610 --> 00:26:27.610
go and work on their
passion project and move opensource

425
00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:34.570
forward for everyone sponsored by,
by Comcast. Absolutely. I, in,

426
00:26:34.570 --> 00:26:37.990
in all humility, it is
not a huge amount of

427
00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:42.410
money. Like some companies do,
but be a very thoughtful

428
00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:46.230
B meet I'm on the
innovation grant committee as well.

429
00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:49.740
And we meet every two
or three weeks. And we

430
00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:54.690
look at, you know, all
of the grant requesters and

431
00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:57.210
we make sure that we
are taught full about making

432
00:26:57.210 --> 00:27:00.470
sure that they get money.
Well, I think that people

433
00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:04.520
have started to realize that
big parts of the internet

434
00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:08.870
itself were run by just
men and women that are

435
00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:13.370
just chugging away by themselves.
Like we remember open SSL.

436
00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:16.010
There was just a very
nice gentlemen working on it

437
00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:17.960
all by himself somewhere. And
no one had really thought

438
00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:21.740
about that person until we
needed them. And, you know,

439
00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:25.790
quality software costs money. It's,
it's so important Scott that

440
00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:30.080
we sustain open source and
that we pay attention to

441
00:27:30.170 --> 00:27:33.290
things that we depend upon
such as openness to sell

442
00:27:33.290 --> 00:27:37.400
exactly, as you said, and
that we have financial funding.

443
00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:41.360
The other aspect of sustainability
that's extremely important to me

444
00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:44.090
is that we open doors
to new people to come

445
00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:47.600
into open source, that we
make it easy to onboard,

446
00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:50.300
that we make it easy
to document projects that we

447
00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:54.890
mentor new people coming in,
especially underrepresented people in open

448
00:27:54.890 --> 00:28:00.260
source. It is still a
very, very much of dominated

449
00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:04.520
by certain communities. And women
are less than 10% of

450
00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:08.870
open source and black. And
my, you know, Hispanic and

451
00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:12.350
native Americans are less than
5%. And, and so that's

452
00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:15.290
an area that I'm very
passionate about and feel that

453
00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:18.770
we need to work much
harder to both sustain, but

454
00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:23.210
also really be open as
an open source community Need.

455
00:28:23.230 --> 00:28:25.250
And it's, I'm glad that
you're in a position of

456
00:28:25.250 --> 00:28:27.920
power where you can move
the leavers and help push

457
00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:31.430
everyone forward. Yes, both at
Comcast. The other hat I

458
00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:33.710
wear is with our tech
women group, I'm all of

459
00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:38.420
a sudden ally with our
LGBTQ community and at the

460
00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:43.100
Linux foundation as an at-large
director, I do not represent

461
00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:46.880
any company. I represent the
community. And as a woman

462
00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:50.810
in tech, that's an area
that I understand really well.

463
00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:54.620
And, and so I've worked
hard with the rest of

464
00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:57.920
the board B almost five
or six women on the

465
00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:01.490
board, which is outstanding. And
so we've all been working

466
00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:05.600
very, very hard to make
it much more inclusive, much

467
00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:08.870
more friendly as a tech
organization. That's a really important

468
00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:10.700
point. I just want to
kind of double click on

469
00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:13.070
to make sure that people
followed that. So you are

470
00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:15.350
a director you're on the
board of directors of the

471
00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:18.560
Linux foundation, which has a
lot of people representing companies,

472
00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:21.020
but you are an at
large director. So you rep

473
00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:23.810
you are there not on
behalf of Comcast, but on

474
00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:26.360
behalf of the community, which
is really cool. Absolutely. I

475
00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:30.200
take it very seriously. It's
an opportunity and a platform

476
00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:33.410
to make a huge difference.
It's an organization that is

477
00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:36.380
an umbrella to so many,
many projects. And so we

478
00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:40.610
can actually set an example
and do some things that

479
00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:44.640
change, you know, the community
and sustain open source. Well,

480
00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:46.290
thank you so much for
talking with me today. I

481
00:29:46.290 --> 00:29:48.510
hope that people who are
listening, who don't have an

482
