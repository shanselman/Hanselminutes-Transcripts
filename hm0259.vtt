00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.560
remote Java development using TFS.
Hi, this is Scott Hanselman,

8
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.230
and this is another episode
of Hansel minutes. Today. I'm

9
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.910
talking to Martin Woodward a
year in England Britain. What's

10
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.220
it? What's the rules. Why
say England or Britain? What's

11
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:09.590
the difference? It's a bit
controversial to begin. Mainly talking

12
00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.890
about that can get into
dribble. You're in Ireland or

13
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:19.100
where are you now? We're
in big political trouble. Where

14
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.130
is, is that? That's its
own thing though. Yeah, yeah.

15
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.870
You say it's not part
of, it's not part of

16
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.970
great Britain, but it's part
of the United Kingdom of great

17
00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.290
Britain and Northern Ireland a
tricky one, but I'm English.

18
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.680
So I'll take it. Okay.
So you're an English man

19
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.080
in Northern Ireland, but you
were Microsoft though. You worked

20
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.420
for Microsoft though. You're in
remote Northern Ireland and I

21
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:47.120
am in remote, Oregon. Yeah.
Working remote sometimes. And you

22
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.390
know, I think it's hardly
remote here only a three,

23
00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.020
four hour drive away from
Redmond on. Yeah. Well, three

24
00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.880
or four hours feels like
a long way to me.

25
00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.500
How far are you from
Redmond? 2020 hour flight. I

26
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.700
think employees. Good. Are you
in a village or are

27
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.430
you in a proper city?
No, I'm in a village.

28
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.580
She lives in a, in
a, just in a sort

29
00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.790
of a field, just outside
of a town called Randalstown.

30
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:20.420
If anyone knows all the
solar panels on our reef.

31
00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.510
And so the hot water
and we actually, we actually

32
00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.940
had free hot water this
afternoon, so that's great. I

33
00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.070
showed you how nice it
is on only this sunny.

34
00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.640
That's pretty progressive. So how
does an Englishman living in

35
00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.820
Northern Ireland end up working
for Microsoft remotely? So yeah,

36
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.960
long story, the company I
used to work for was

37
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.760
a company called team price.
So that was founded by

38
00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.860
a guy called Eric sink.
He, he, you know, very

39
00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.400
well and many of your
listeners, you know, so, and

40
00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.360
Eric's a cool guy. And
he had a, he was

41
00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.550
looking to get some people
to start a, an eclipse

42
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.340
plugin to team foundation server
was what he was wanting

43
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.610
to do. And it just
so happened that I'd been,

44
00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.420
I'd been working on kind
of a similar thing as

45
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.990
a side project, you know,
as many people do, I

46
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.020
do some dotnet and some
Java work. And when I

47
00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.110
was in the.net world professionally,
then I would go do

48
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.240
some Java work on the
site. And when I was

49
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.300
doing some Java work professionally,
I'd go to decent.network in

50
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.490
my spare time to keep,
you know, keep your hand

51
00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.480
in. And yeah, so I'd
been doing some work. I'd

52
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.410
been working with TFS very
early betas in a.net gig.

53
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.730
I was working on and,
and working on an eclipse

54
00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.250
plug into TFS in my
spare time as an open

55
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.880
source project. And then Eric
sort of did a blog

56
00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.310
post, but he was setting
up a company and you'd

57
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.160
have to move to champagne,
Illinois, which is a beautiful

58
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.310
part of the world, but
I can't move to America.

59
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.520
That's how many reasons I'm
happy here. So I sort

60
00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.970
of wrote to them and
said, Hey, I would look

61
00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.460
to work for you. I've
got these seasonal credentials kind

62
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.860
of thing, but a portion
I can't move to champagne.

63
00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.630
In fact, I can't move
to America. You know, would

64
00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.360
you still be interested really
expecting him to say no,

65
00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.610
go away sort of thing.
W it was worth a

66
00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.850
try and always, always wanted
to work for him. And

67
00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.490
then, and then he said,
yes. So that was a

68
00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:22.030
start of an amazing journey
team price. The company was

69
00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:23.950
founded and, you know, we've
got version one out the

70
00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.400
door and there's in TC
three and a half. And

71
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.830
we were so successful as
this little startup doing the

72
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.600
cross platform and eclipse integration
to team foundation server. Microsoft

73
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.720
decided to buy us one
day and, and, and yeah,

74
00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.220
went through all the whole
thing. And that was how

75
00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.520
I ended up working for
Mike's. So back up a

76
00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.510
little bit, you were working
on an eclipse plugin for

77
00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:54.960
TFS on, in your spare
time. So I guess the

78
00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.660
part I'm having trouble with
is just the initial assumption

79
00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.270
that that's a needed thing.
It sounds like it is

80
00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.690
because it's apparently not only
was a company created, becomes,

81
00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.480
became successful and then purchase,
but you also had happened

82
00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.140
to be working on it.
What kind of environment would

83
00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.990
you use TFS and eclipse?
I would think eclipse people

84
00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:19.920
would want to use like
subversion clips. People, You know,

85
00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.710
just version control is obviously
very fragmented in the world

86
00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:27.570
is, you know, lots of
very popular version control products.

87
00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.490
And none of them really
have more than say 20,

88
00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:37.080
25% of the market. So
I've been working on Project

89
00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.650
I was working on at
the time was, was appeal.net

90
00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.860
project, but we had Java
guys in the company as

91
00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.310
well. And, and it was
actually, our project was sort

92
00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:51.840
of a web service front
end. There's some business logic

93
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:57.120
that we were coding in.net.
And it also had Java

94
00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.540
groups talking into it, as
well as, you know, dot

95
00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:04.130
net people talking into this
web service. So I could

96
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:09.140
see the need for Java
to talk, you know, Java

97
00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:13.380
projects being involved in this
same overall big project that,

98
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:16.610
that was all stored in
TFS. And of course, TFS

99
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.590
is mobile more than just
source control. You know, it's

100
00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:23.390
got overworked homes and stuff
and things like requirements and,

101
00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:29.090
and books that they all
don't care about, what language

102
00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:31.430
you happen to be, to
be writing your code in

103
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.760
a requirement, needs to be
implemented across everything. And so

104
00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.180
that's kind of where storing
everything in one place made

105
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:42.740
sense and, and CFS, I
particularly enjoyed and particularly liked

106
00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.090
competitive products I was using
before. And so, yeah, for,

107
00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:48.830
well, this is going to,
people are definitely going to

108
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:50.150
want to do it. So
I thought I'd give it

109
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:52.160
a go. And it had
some interesting challenges in terms

110
00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.460
of, you know, talking to
the.net web services from, from

111
00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.320
Java and all that sort
of stuff. It was, you

112
00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:01.060
know, there's some good, interesting
challenges there. So, So I'm

113
00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.550
looking at a screenshot in
a PowerPoint that I found

114
00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:07.990
online that shows IDE integration
of this foundation server and,

115
00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:10.450
you know, people I've had.
I actually, we had, we

116
00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:15.730
mentioned TFS recently on the
show and we had some

117
00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:18.190
positives and some negatives people
have very passionate about their

118
00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:21.520
source control. What I'm interested
in talking to you about

119
00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:25.330
though is less about religious
arguments around source control, but

120
00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:27.820
more about the idea that
I'm looking at a screenshot

121
00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:31.090
within the eclipse team foundation
server, as it says, team

122
00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:33.550
foundation server exploring, and it
has a picture of a

123
00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:37.240
bug form someone's filling out
a bug. And then right

124
00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:40.780
next to it is visual
studio, which, you know, honestly

125
00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:45.400
looks exactly like eclipse, except
for the tabs are curvier

126
00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.940
and eclipse. I mean, it's
the same icons, it's the

127
00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:52.780
same exact form. It looks
like the same thing. Is

128
00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:56.650
that true? Is it identical?
Yeah. Who in, in that

129
00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:58.510
screenshot, who's the builder assigned
to you? By the way,

130
00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:00.910
I'm just interested to hear
the screenshots from It says

131
00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:05.170
ASMR is a bug assigned
to nobody. Area. Adventure works,

132
00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:08.090
create a bulk created by
Martin Woodward. There you are.

133
00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:10.270
There we go. It's always
good. It's amazing where your

134
00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:15.460
screenshots set up. That's funny
March 11th of last year. Yes,

135
00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:22.030
you are checking in. See
Martin demo vs. Billing service,

136
00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:28.030
The classic billing service. Hello,
world. Bad example. What was

137
00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:29.650
the question? I forgot where
you were at, you were

138
00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:32.920
asking, Well, I'm looking at
eclipse and it looks identical.

139
00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:35.410
The visual studio, I mean,
big integrated IDs are big

140
00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:39.340
integrated ideas. It seems, but
I'm looking at team Explorer

141
00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:41.830
and they both look like
they're exactly the same. Are

142
00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:45.670
you writing this to basically
copy? I mean like, do

143
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:48.190
you just take exactly what
they do in vs and

144
00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:51.940
then just do the exact
same thing. So there's some

145
00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:56.520
extent where that is true.
Eclipses has got its own

146
00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:59.160
sort of language, you know,
in terms of how people

147
00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.570
use it. So if you
were to look at the,

148
00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:06.900
the version controls stuff inside
of eclipse, everything lives under

149
00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:09.420
a team menu. So you,
you know, you right click.

150
00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:13.080
And even if you don't
currently have version control installed,

151
00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:16.410
you might click, you'd go
to team. And then there

152
00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:18.630
would be a share project.
You know, if you had

153
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:21.450
a project that wasn't bound
to anything, and then from

154
00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:24.480
that, you would pick your
version control provider. And this

155
00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.480
is just the version control.
Now you pick your version

156
00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.780
control provider and, you know,
be it CVS or TFS

157
00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:33.930
or subversion or get, or
something like that. And then

158
00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:36.420
when you pick one of
those, you then connect up

159
00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:38.760
to your version control provider
and have check code in

160
00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:41.610
and share the project with,
with people on your team.

161
00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:44.580
So we, in, in, in
eclipse, we live under the

162
00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:47.640
team menu and we don't
do anything of noxious, like,

163
00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:50.490
you know, stick up great,
big visual studio icon over

164
00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:54.210
your eclipse icon, or, you
know, suddenly make it so

165
00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:57.060
you can check in anything
apart from C sharp or

166
00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:59.070
something like that. You know,
it's all, it's all very

167
00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:03.270
respectful and eclipse. And we,
we stick to the, the

168
00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:06.480
sort of UI design conventions
for the coding in eclipse.

169
00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.790
We stick to all those,
but then there's a bunch

170
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:12.960
of other stuff there's not
version control. That's things like

171
00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:16.080
work items and builds and,
you know, being able to

172
00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:18.720
build and being able to
look at build results, those

173
00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:22.800
sorts of things, a server
build. So TFS build and,

174
00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.960
and you want to do
all those without leaving your

175
00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.720
ID, or some people wants
to do all those without

176
00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:30.120
leaving the idea, you know,
there's, there's you talk about

177
00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:31.980
religious debates about version of
the job, is it, you

178
00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:34.800
know, there's always religious debates
about, are you in the

179
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:37.200
ID kind of guy or
an outside of the ID

180
00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:40.810
kind of guy, and this
is all inside the ID

181
00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:43.140
inside the class. Well, yeah,
in terms of, in terms

182
00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:46.620
of that side, we tried
to be very much authentic

183
00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:49.920
to visual studio. We do,
we do change things a

184
00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:54.060
little bit around to make
it more eclipsed. So for

185
00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:56.970
instance, we, when you're doing
a bill, there's no point

186
00:10:56.970 --> 00:10:59.310
in bringing up, if you
want to create a new

187
00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:01.140
build, you don't want to
create a new, you know,

188
00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:05.700
build against a solution file.
You probably in eclipse are

189
00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:09.030
more likely to want to
create a build against an

190
00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:12.120
unscript or exam aunts. You
know, what they're gonna use

191
00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.460
in the Java world or
Maven is also very common

192
00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:17.490
in the Java world. We
don't show you a solution

193
00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:19.830
file. We show you files
and even files, and you

194
00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:22.920
go, you go pick your
heel or even build script

195
00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:25.380
and go on the bill.
But in terms of the

196
00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:29.490
wording that we live in,
the eclipse splice paste places,

197
00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:34.260
we use the TFS words.
So, and that confuses some

198
00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.270
people, you know, when they've
come from say subversion or

199
00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:40.740
something like that. So check
out for us is, Hey

200
00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:43.470
server, I'd like to add
it, this file not I'd

201
00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:45.450
like to download this file,
which you know, which is

202
00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:48.180
what it means to a
subversion person, or we have

203
00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:51.420
get and check in rather
than update and things like

204
00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:54.130
that. So we use the
TFS words, but in the

205
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:57.440
eclipse places, does that make
sense? I see. So you,

206
00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:00.630
you, people who are used
to eclipse will go looking

207
00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:03.420
for the command, they'll find
it in the right place.

208
00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:07.200
It's just maybe using the
TFS term. Yeah. You still

209
00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.630
need to, you still using
a different product. Are you

210
00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:12.810
still using TFS? We don't
try and pretend where subversion

211
00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:17.430
or something like that. We
were very much surface TFS

212
00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:20.070
in your face kind of
thing. And, and, and, you

213
00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:21.960
know, make you very aware
that you are using this

214
00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:25.920
sort of system. So it
means that people who've learned

215
00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:28.710
TFS on, you know, quite
a lot of people, like

216
00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:32.130
I did switch IDs a
lot and, and it makes,

217
00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:34.710
it makes that part easy.
It also means that there's

218
00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:36.420
only one set of trainings
for people to do. And

219
00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:38.340
still, you know, when they're
getting familiar, they can ask

220
00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:41.040
anyone in their company, Hey,
how do we do, how

221
00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.380
do we do something? The
source control, how do we

222
00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:46.050
branch? How do we, how
do we do a build?

223
00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:48.960
And the dotnet guy could
tell the eclipse guy how

224
00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:50.910
to do it. And they
would both, they would both

225
00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:57.120
get there or vice versa.
This is all written in

226
00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:00.090
Java. So everything inside. Yeah.
It's all 100% job. Okay.

227
00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:02.190
There's a little bit of
native code in there to

228
00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:05.910
do some, some stuff that
Java can't do well. So

229
00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:09.750
we also, as well as
there's like 99.9, 9% Java

230
00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:11.100
code, and then we have
a little bit of native

231
00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:15.120
code that, that does things
like certain files read only

232
00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:18.180
reliably, which Java can't do
in all versions of Java

233
00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:22.640
and doing some blocking and
talking to talking to curb

234
00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:25.230
Ross. We, we, we do
some authentication hooks as a

235
00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:27.700
say on, on Linux. You
might want to hook into

236
00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:31.200
it. You platforms coboss libraries.
If you've, if you've bound

237
00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:34.230
your Linux workstation to active
directory, for example, and you

238
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:35.850
want a single sign on
and all that. So we

239
00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:38.070
use a bit of native
code as well. Well, that's

240
00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:40.020
using J and I, you
know, we don't, we're not,

241
00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:42.840
we're not doing anything crazy,
like equivalent of sort of

242
00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:45.840
PMO can out to some.net
assembly or running maneuver as

243
00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:47.940
well as jar or anything
crazy like that. It's all

244
00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:51.390
Java. And this works on
just on eclipse, on windows

245
00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:56.100
or eclipse on. Yeah. I
mean, we have, we, we,

246
00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:59.520
we don't. So most of
the, you mean, people listen

247
00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:02.040
to them over the whole,
like a horrible term dogfooding

248
00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:06.240
so we dog food, we
use it ourselves. We have

249
00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:09.150
like a third of the
team on windows, a third

250
00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:11.850
on Mac and a third
on Linux developing day to

251
00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:15.840
day. And that catches most
things cause screen layouts tend

252
00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:18.180
to be a bit different
on different platforms. And obviously

253
00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:22.140
the difference between say Unix
file syntax and windows file

254
00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:25.910
syntax is very different. So
I'm just, dogfooding on those

255
00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:27.810
few things, catches a lot
of issues. And then we

256
00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:31.470
go test on, on other
platforms like Solaris and AIX,

257
00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:34.590
and HPUX those sorts of
things. We run everywhere that

258
00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:38.070
eclipse runs everywhere, that Java
runs. So how does that

259
00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:39.570
work? How do you test
all those things? Do you

260
00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:42.810
have a lab somewhere that's
got Solaris, A lab and,

261
00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:46.200
you know, we have a,
it's amazing the hardware you

262
00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:49.830
can find laying around in
Microsoft, went looking for. So

263
00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:53.720
we had an AIX box
that was, we had an

264
00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:56.810
old version of AIX, 5.8,
5.9 or something like that.

265
00:14:57.290 --> 00:15:01.820
And one particular customer having
a problem with Kerberos implementation

266
00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:04.430
on AIX six one. And
we didn't have that in

267
00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:08.120
our lab. So, so we
went around, looking at Microsoft

268
00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:10.610
and found somebody else who
happened to be getting a

269
00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:12.960
new AI X-Box since we
went and bought their AI,

270
00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:17.060
X-Box with it and some
testing. So amazing. Microsoft's a

271
00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:20.150
lot more mixed than people
realize, you know, we do.

272
00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:22.340
We do. We develop for
all sorts of platforms as

273
00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:26.470
well as our own. Hi,
this is Scott coming to

274
00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:29.290
you from another place in
time. Are you using agile

275
00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:32.110
practices to manage your software
development? There's lots of tools

276
00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:34.210
in the market that manage
the steps of a project,

277
00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:37.330
but most of them focus
on individual roles, get ready

278
00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:39.250
for a solution that caters
for the success of the

279
00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:42.910
whole team. Guys at Tellerik
introduced team pulse to an

280
00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:46.570
agile project management tool. That'll
help you gather ideas, estimate

281
00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:51.040
plan, track progress in a
common workspace. Finally, companies, regardless

282
00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:53.110
of their size can use
a lightweight and convenient tool

283
00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:55.540
that makes all the stakeholders
work as a United team.

284
00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:59.680
Even if they're in different
countries by combining intuitive user

285
00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:02.380
interface and the power server
light team poles removes the

286
00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:05.020
roadblocks that you typically face
and applying agile in an

287
00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:09.100
effective manner, no more lost
data, no disparate systems, no

288
00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:12.580
lack of critical analytics regarding
the health and philosophy project.

289
00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:16.060
See if yourself get a
free copy for five users

290
00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:22.510
in one project at tellerik.com/team
pulse. And please do thank

291
00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:25.270
tolerance for supporting Hansel minutes
on their Facebook fan page,

292
00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:31.780
facebook.com/t L E R I
K color. We do appreciate

293
00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:33.820
it. They wouldn't be a,
and if there wasn't, Tellerik

294
00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:39.700
helping us. One time, I
took a Mac into Microsoft

295
00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:42.280
to the, where the, the
guys that make office for

296
00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:44.620
the Mac and they have
a Mac lab. There was

297
00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:47.050
a guy with a Mac
lab. He's got like 40

298
00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:49.960
max. And you basically walk
in with your Mac and

299
00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:54.400
he puts the Microsoft image
of the macro S X

300
00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:57.360
O S tan, rather Not
the image. I don't know

301
00:16:57.370 --> 00:17:00.430
if this story that this
is a lab down in

302
00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:05.200
Mac B, you might boo
in on Silicon Valley. And

303
00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:09.640
they have just this rack
as like tables for Mac

304
00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:12.760
minis, where they, where they
do all their automated testing.

305
00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:16.120
Cause you know, most of
the bigger, bigger test automation.

306
00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:20.470
And so they have all
the UI test automation scripts

307
00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:22.630
running on the, all these
Mac minis and a huge

308
00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:27.910
lab. Let's just start there.
It's bizarre to see. You're

309
00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:30.640
still trying to get my
head around. You're in Northern

310
00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:34.210
Ireland. So are you the
only Java person or are

311
00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:39.070
there others? The, the rovers
we have. So team price,

312
00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:42.970
the company, when we, we,
we sold the technology, you

313
00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:45.970
know, the source code and
everything over to Microsoft and

314
00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:50.250
then over developers and global
people were by Microsoft as

315
00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:52.830
well. And so we came
to work, Microsoft. We had

316
00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:56.240
to go through the whole
interview process. That was interesting

317
00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:58.380
going through all the technical
interviews and all that sort

318
00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:02.430
of thing, which was a
surprising thing at a time,

319
00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:05.340
we didn't realize we were
going, going to go through

320
00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:08.820
a technical interview. You know,
we we'd never been bought

321
00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:12.470
before. Whereas Microsoft are obviously
experts at buying people and

322
00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:14.910
we just turned up one
day in a, in a

323
00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:17.940
conference room expecting, you know,
a chat. Cause we used

324
00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:19.680
to talk to the TFS
team all the time. Anyway.

325
00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:22.350
And then, you know, I
went off and talked to

326
00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:24.540
one of the guys, one
of the managers in the

327
00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:27.320
TFS team and he asked
me to coach some questions.

328
00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:30.600
You know, he asked me
how I would, how old

329
00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:34.340
I think it was how
I would convert a entered

330
00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:37.140
incident to a string or
something, or vice versa, no

331
00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:38.790
string to an integer. I
think it was or something

332
00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:41.610
like that. And I was
like, Oh, just use, you

333
00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:46.980
know, introduce adult pause in,
how would you code it?

334
00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:48.420
And I'm like, Oh, I
do. I think, can you

335
00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:51.540
write it on a whiteboard
and start, Oh, hang on

336
00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:54.060
a minute. Is this a,
is this an interview? He's

337
00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:57.510
like, yeah. Oh, okay. So
then we had a technical

338
00:18:57.510 --> 00:19:00.450
NCC for the day and
over guys and team price.

339
00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:02.820
They were based in Illinois
and they all moved to

340
00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:07.020
North Carolina. So the team foundation
server team is split between

341
00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:11.610
North Carolina and Redmond. And you
know, it was a big

342
00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:14.910
bunch of guys in North Carolina.
And so that's where all

343
00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:17.580
the, the, the team post
guys moved to. And then

344
00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:19.800
a few of the Microsoft
people came and joined the

345
00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:22.770
team as well, which is
good. So easy to recruit

346
00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:25.830
Java people around North Carolina, for
some reason. And then Redmond,

347
00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:31.400
you know, It's interesting that,
that Microsoft is doing more

348
00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:34.790
stuff on other platforms that
aren't windows. Like. I mean,

349
00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:36.680
just, just the fact that
you're saying that you've got

350
00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:40.490
this running everywhere, you know,
Solarix and Solaris and AIX

351
00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:43.370
and all over the place.
And then I just downloaded

352
00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:48.950
a one note for the
iPhone and that crazy. I

353
00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:50.990
know the Bing stuff as
well, but they do that

354
00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:54.380
thing absolutely. Incredibly popular. Yeah.
So, I mean, it's just,

355
00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:57.200
it's like what other stuff
is running around this company

356
00:19:57.230 --> 00:20:00.140
that we don't know about?
Yeah. I mean, listen sent

357
00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:02.000
it to a lot of
stuff as well. I mean,

358
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.860
we get to see a
lot of these people because

359
00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:09.620
obviously TFS is used a
lot internally in Microsoft as

360
00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:14.030
a source control system and
work homes. And so the

361
00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:16.520
sorts of people tend to
come out the woodwork suite.

362
00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:18.050
We hear about them all
the time, you know, cause

363
00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:20.300
they need to use our
client to talk to TFS

364
00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:23.810
from non windows platforms. You
know, it's what we use

365
00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:30.110
internally most of today. And
so it's, yeah, it's interesting

366
00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:32.480
to hear about more the
sort of like seeing the

367
00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:34.970
ones we use a lot,
you know, he's a product

368
00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:37.580
a lot, obviously they're big
on the Mac and the

369
00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:41.390
civil ICLR guys or one
of our biggest early customers

370
00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:42.770
at Microsoft when we went
back when, when we were

371
00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:48.430
at team price. Ah, okay.
So you're interesting. So the

372
00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:51.700
Silverlight team that makes Silverlight
work on the Mac is

373
00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:55.590
running eclipse on the Mac
or they're running. They actually

374
00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:58.680
use, we have a command
line as well. So they

375
00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:01.740
use the command line mostly
because it's all into their

376
00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:07.560
automation stuff. So those guys
editing away, you know, whatever

377
00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:11.250
they use via VM or
Emacs, whatever. I don't think

378
00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:14.370
they use much hex code
on the Mac. They just

379
00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:16.710
hack away and then check
in using the command line,

380
00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:20.640
you know, TF check in
a certain file and off

381
00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:23.580
they go and work and
all the build process as

382
00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:27.210
well. But they have, they
have to build the Silverlight

383
00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:31.500
on the, on macOS 10,
you know, to make it

384
00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:35.280
compile my host hand and,
and all that builds. Stuff's

385
00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:38.460
automated using our, our command
line as well. Which, which

386
00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:41.730
wardens, anywhere Java runs again.
Oh, so it's a command

387
00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:45.060
line, job application as well.
Yeah. So just like the

388
00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:48.840
command line application for on,
you know, when you install

389
00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:51.270
visual studio, you get a
TF command, which allows you

390
00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:55.170
to talk to team foundation
server. That's when in.net, if

391
00:21:55.170 --> 00:21:57.720
you install, you know, just
visual studio, but if you

392
00:21:58.050 --> 00:21:59.790
have a job version of
the command line in it,

393
00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:02.100
it runs Java. So there's
a bit of overhead there

394
00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:05.370
in terms of firing of
her JVM, just like there

395
00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:09.810
is in.net firing the CLR,
but, but it works pretty

396
00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:12.210
well. And there's some tricks
to keep it around in

397
00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:15.810
memory and stuff. So it
works quite well. No, no,

398
00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:17.910
I'm a remote guy and
I know what it's like

399
00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:20.220
to be, to be remote.
And I know that, you

400
00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:22.560
know, sometimes you get looked
at a little differently. People

401
00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:25.680
treat you a slightly differently
because you're remote. Sometimes they're

402
00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:29.100
frustrated that you're remote and
you're probably as a remote

403
00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:31.710
person in another time zone,
it's an even bigger problem.

404
00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:36.330
But being, it's one thing
to be remote. It's another

405
00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:39.780
to be a remote in
another time zone, but to

406
00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:45.390
be remote and running Java.
And in other times, doesn't

407
00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:49.530
that make you feel a
little separate problem. And how

408
00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:52.080
long have you worked here
now? Well, year and a

409
00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:54.720
quarter now. So you're in
the court. You are now.

410
00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:00.240
No, I would say in
some ways, well maybe it

411
00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:03.180
does make me feel a
bit separate. So I'm officially

412
00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:07.440
a program manager. So even,
even though I do some

413
00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:11.400
development, I check, I check
in code into, into the

414
00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:16.230
eclipse plugin, into team, explore
everywhere, but I'm a program

415
00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:19.650
manager. And so kind of
my jobs to be out

416
00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:21.840
there, figuring out what we
need to do for the

417
00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:26.610
product. And I think being
remote kind of helps your

418
00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:30.540
stay separate from the whole
Redmond bubble. You know, there's

419
00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:32.730
a, there's this bit of
a, you can, you can

420
00:23:32.730 --> 00:23:36.210
easily the huge campuses, Microsoft,
you can easily forget that

421
00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:39.690
there's a world outside your
window that doesn't know anything

422
00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:42.390
about you that doesn't know
anything about Microsoft technologies. You

423
00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:46.430
know, whereas being out here
in little field in Randallstown

424
00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:50.750
and we're living out in
the field as you call

425
00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:53.030
it in Mosul terms, but
living out in the community,

426
00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:57.020
I think it really helps
me keep the perspective as

427
00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:59.840
to what the real world's
like, what, what people would

428
00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:04.160
proper jobs after or their
frustrations, or does it help

429
00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:06.620
you being without, do you
think from staying out of

430
00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:09.760
that whole Microsoft thing? Yeah.
I've talked about it before

431
00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:12.100
on the, on the show,
I call it the Redmond

432
00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:16.330
reality distortion field. I give
the Redmond guys a hard

433
00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:18.340
time. Cause it's all I
have is the ability to

434
00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:19.930
do that is to give
them a hard time. Cause

435
00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:22.600
they're there. But you know,
I just remind them that

436
00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:24.610
when was the last, I
mean, this is the thing

437
00:24:24.610 --> 00:24:26.620
and I get in trouble
for this regularly, but I

438
00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:28.690
mean, you know how it
is, you talk to someone

439
00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:31.780
who's maybe worked there 20,
30 years and you say

440
00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:34.570
something like, when was the
last time you shipped something

441
00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:38.050
outside of Microsoft? You know?
Cause it's frustrating to talk

442
00:24:38.050 --> 00:24:41.170
to people who think they
have it all figured out,

443
00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:43.660
right? They think they have
the way the software works

444
00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:46.510
in the real world. I'll
figure it out. And then

445
00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:49.300
you find that any they've
never worked anywhere else. So

446
00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:52.990
they know how to ship
software at Microsoft. But you

447
00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:55.930
know, I really respect people
who quit Microsoft go off

448
00:24:55.930 --> 00:24:57.730
and like work for an
insurance company or something and

449
00:24:57.730 --> 00:25:00.730
suffer and then come back.
You see what I'm saying?

450
00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:07.870
Right. Yeah. Yeah. And that's,
I had an interesting one

451
00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:11.770
of those very recently. So
I was talking to somebody

452
00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:15.310
and we were doing some
work and we were trying

453
00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:17.800
to figure out how to
have to do something. And

454
00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:21.520
in the, in the windows
side, the command line, when

455
00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:24.190
it needs to do a
particular thing, if it couldn't

456
00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:28.450
figure out what It would
pop up And it would,

457
00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:31.300
you know, ask a question
in this window and have

458
00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:35.050
a whole windowing interface to
solve it. And I was

459
00:25:35.050 --> 00:25:36.910
like, you do, as we
can't, you know, I can't

460
00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:39.520
do that from Linux. And
they were like, why not?

461
00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:45.030
I was like, pardon me?
Why can't you pop up

462
00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:47.410
a dialogue? Is it not
technically possible? And you know,

463
00:25:47.410 --> 00:25:50.140
went down this whole, surely
you can just call this

464
00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:52.090
API and look, you can
see, you can pop up

465
00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:56.500
a window and I could
technically maybe pop up a

466
00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:59.380
window if someone happened to
be logged into a graphical

467
00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:01.870
interface. But most of the
time they're SSH 10 and

468
00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:03.940
they're not really actually, you
know, we don't have an

469
00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:07.210
X window connection back and
command lines just don't do

470
00:26:07.210 --> 00:26:11.290
that on Linux. It's just,
yeah, it was funny. Just

471
00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:15.220
there's some assumptions which people
make, which they don't realize

472
00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:18.700
they're making just from the
background and sort of Microsoft's

473
00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:22.120
in technology and things. And
hopefully being, being remote helps

474
00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:24.850
some of that. The, there
is frustrations as well, but

475
00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:27.880
the time zones, probably the
biggest frustration for me. I

476
00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:31.420
mean, it's not too bad
because the majority of my,

477
00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:34.510
my team over in North Carolina,
which is only sort of

478
00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:38.590
five hours, different four hours
at the moment, but you

479
00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:41.710
know, Redmond's avail pain. Cause
you, you, you guys start,

480
00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:44.280
you know, when I at
five o'clock and if I

481
00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:47.520
work normal hours and I
should be finishing around about

482
00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:50.220
then. So if I wanted
to have any meetings with

483
00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:53.490
anyone, it's always eating into
family time and things are,

484
00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:58.080
that's the only frustration. I
think that I've not been

485
00:26:58.090 --> 00:27:00.240
able to get why around
a whiteboard together. You know,

486
00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:04.530
this time I haven't found
an adequate replacement for getting

487
00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:07.230
around a whiteboard. The closest
I've found is just pointing

488
00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:11.580
a, a webcam at a
whiteboard civically and enjoying on

489
00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:14.460
it. Cause even all those
fancy whiteboard programs and all

490
00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:16.380
those sorts of things, none
of those work very well.

491
00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:18.870
I found, I don't know
unless you've heard anything better

492
00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:21.950
than that. There's a, I
think there's a whiteboard program

493
00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:25.100
built into windows, live messenger.
And I bought up $50.

494
00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:27.290
I bought a $50 Wacom
tablet, but no, it's not

495
00:27:27.290 --> 00:27:30.050
the same. Yeah. They never
worked very well. And you,

496
00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:32.300
you know, you, you writing's
always with child. I shouldn't

497
00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:35.180
even with a tablet PC.
There's never, there's never the

498
00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:37.970
same as cause if you
look at what you draw

499
00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:41.510
on a whiteboard, when you're
talking on a whiteboard, the

500
00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:43.940
value isn't in what you've
written on the whiteboard often

501
00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:45.830
it's like a squiggle for
nobody could read, you know,

502
00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:47.990
if he took a picture
of it later, it doesn't

503
00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:51.500
mean anything. It was the
process of getting up and

504
00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:54.800
standing up with a pen
and explaining it to somebody

505
00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:57.260
and talking it through that.
That was the valuable thing.

506
00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:01.550
I don't know. That's that's
the thing I miss most

507
00:28:01.790 --> 00:28:06.680
a white board. Yeah. Do
you think that this will

508
00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:08.300
last a long time? I
mean, how long can you

509
00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:11.390
work at Microsoft remotely from
Northern Ireland, between Java at

510
00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:13.430
some point, will you have
to stop or will you

511
00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:18.410
get tired? You know, but
didn't for six years and,

512
00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:21.260
and then, okay, so far
seem to be doing quite

513
00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:29.600
well. There's definitely. So in,
in Microsoft terms, you what's,

514
00:28:30.770 --> 00:28:33.120
you what's called an individual
contributor. You know, you don't,

515
00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:36.470
you don't have people, you
don't have people reporting to

516
00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:41.150
you. So there's a limit
in terms of career versus,

517
00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:43.640
you know, as an individual
contributor, as an IC, they

518
00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:46.580
call that you can get
to before you don't have

519
00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:51.050
anyone reporting to you, but
in Microsoft, that's actually a

520
00:28:51.050 --> 00:28:53.300
lot. You can get a
lot higher and you know,

521
00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:55.250
you can get very far
in the company and never

522
00:28:55.250 --> 00:29:00.500
have anyone reporting to you.
It is amazing. The Microsoft

523
00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:05.360
is an interesting company because
woman, you, you find the

524
00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:08.210
same thing. You know, you
get the same, you get

525
00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:10.490
the same people. You get
working everywhere in parts of

526
00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:13.220
the company. So the same,
you know, stupid people work

527
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:15.770
here just slightly work everywhere,
but then you'll turn the

528
00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:19.820
corner and you'll, you'll you'll
you meet the most brilliant

529
00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:22.130
person you've ever met in
your entire life. You know,

530
00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:26.120
you realize that you're never,
ever going to be remotely,

531
00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:31.210
as clever as this person
was before breakfast. Was it

532
00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:34.860
a dinner when it was
over? And I was over

533
00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:36.650
in Redmond recently and I
was sat down at one

534
00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:40.120
of these, these fancy dinner
things. And you know, you

535
00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:43.270
go around the table, shaking
hands of people like at

536
00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:45.310
a wedding reception, when you
come in, you know, all,

537
00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:48.160
everybody shakes hands and sort
of introduces themselves. And a

538
00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:50.530
lot of sat down and
shake hands with one guy.

539
00:29:50.530 --> 00:29:52.630
We, we have a chat,
you know, introduced herself. And

540
00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:54.940
she said, I turned to
my right and this guy

541
00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:59.350
goes, hello. I am unders
it didn't sound like Sean

542
00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:06.960
Connery, but it was, it
was under, What am I

543
00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:08.820
going to talk to you
about that one this next

544
00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:14.580
half hour? You know, I'm
a job guy. I barely

545
00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:18.270
understand, you know, Lincoln, all
these new things that are

546
00:30:18.270 --> 00:30:20.910
in C sharp. So, but
we ended up having a

547
00:30:20.910 --> 00:30:24.240
great conversation. He was, again,
he was annoyingly well-read, but

548
00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:28.380
I was a physicist and
I never did computer science.

549
00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:31.950
I did physics. And so,
you know, it was talking

550
00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:34.140
to, we were talking about
some stuff around there and

551
00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:38.040
how you could end conversation
about how you could possibly

552
00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:41.700
use computer modeling to model
superstition and how maybe that's

553
00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:44.070
what's happening with the current
economic climate. So it was

554
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:47.130
a bizarre conversation, but, but
good. But there's an example

555
00:30:47.130 --> 00:30:52.740
of a brilliant guy. He
works here. Yeah. It is

556
00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:56.370
funny. I, when I, there
are equally, there are stupid

557
00:30:56.370 --> 00:30:59.040
people at the company. When
you said that though, I

558
00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:01.680
was thinking to myself. Yes,
but are stupid people. They're

559
00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:07.830
just so passionate. Well, no,
it should be the wrong

560
00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:10.410
word, but you know what
I mean? Forcibly there. Yeah.

561
00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:11.910
And what they lack in
common sense. They make up

562
00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:16.410
for being super excited. Yeah.
I found myself saying super

563
00:31:16.410 --> 00:31:20.130
a lot. Most of my
kids hate it. And the

564
00:31:20.130 --> 00:31:24.360
other thing is I started
reading dates wrong. So I've

565
00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:27.780
worked for American companies for
nearly 10 years now, since

566
00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:32.220
working with Microsoft started doing
dates of the month before

567
00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:37.020
the day I read a
day, my wife gave me

568
00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:38.940
a date. That's an important
thing. And I put it

569
00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:40.800
in the diary in the
wrong month because I'd read

570
00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:45.150
it the wrong way round.
Yeah. I can totally relate.

571
00:31:45.330 --> 00:31:48.420
I can totally relate. All
right. Well, thanks for talking

572
00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:49.770
to me, Martin. I really
appreciate it. It's good to

573
00:31:49.770 --> 00:31:52.290
talk to other remote people
at Microsoft and especially ones

574
00:31:52.290 --> 00:31:58.350
that aren't necessarily working on
typical Microsoft stuff. This has

575
00:31:58.350 --> 00:32:01.350
been another episode of Hansel
minutes. We'll see you again

576
00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:01.770
next week.
