talks with Steve Souders head

7
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.110
performance engineer at Google about
web performance and open source

8
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.350
initiatives. Hi, this is Scott
Hanselman, another episode of Hansel

9
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.220
minutes. And I'm talking with
Steve Sanders head performance engineer

10
00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.360
at, at the Google. Is
that right? Yeah, he's got,

11
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.790
how are you? I'm pretty
well. Have you always been

12
00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.120
at Google? No, I've been
here a long time now

13
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.730
three and a half years.
I still feel new, but

14
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.860
you know, Google is pretty
old, but I was before

15
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.130
that, I was at Yahoo
for eight years. I started

16
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.940
a company before that, that
I sold. And before that

17
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.080
I was at, who were
that got bought by Lycos.

18
00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.390
And so I had the
pleasure of being at two

19
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.920
companies that have a, a
grammatical symbol in their name

20
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.160
who were, had a question
Mark with the exclamation point

21
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.500
and was that some AI
companies before that. Cool. That's

22
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.270
funny. I've been at Microsoft
three and a half years

23
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.250
and I feel like I'm
new too. I still try.

24
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.590
I still try to pretend
like I'm new in presentations

25
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.230
and people aren't buying it
at this point. Yeah, I

26
00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.860
think, you know, I don't
know what the exit turnover

27
00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.860
rate is at Google. My
guess would be that it's

28
00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.480
lower than other companies. And
I know folks at Microsoft

29
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.850
like Eric Lawrence, you know, some,
some of the people that

30
00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.880
I've, I've been in touch
with there are real old

31
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.610
timers. And I think for,
you know, these good big

32
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.300
companies, there's a fair amount
of retention of, of people

33
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.970
who were there in the
early days. And so when

34
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.050
you go into meetings and
there's someone who has an

35
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.900
employee ID number, that's two
orders of magnitude lower than

36
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.320
yours. You kind of still
feel new. Yeah. It's funny.

37
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.360
Actually, one question, I didn't
think I was going to

38
00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.560
ask you, but now I
want to ask you, is

39
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.230
that I've, I've kind of
complained internally and also a

40
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.410
little bit publicly about what
I and Microsoft people will

41
00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.270
be upset when I say
this, but I've complained about

42
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.760
what I call college hires.
You know, like, you know,

43
00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.390
I'm 38 and all to
meet some guys 38 and

44
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.200
we'll start talking and he
seems like a nice guy,

45
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.290
but then he'll feel very,
Microsofty like, I can feel

46
00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.840
the Microsoft Venus and I'll
say, well, where did you

47
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.550
work before this? And I'll
find out he was hired

48
00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.230
out of college and he's
been there for 20 years

49
00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.810
or something. Is there a
Google equivalent of like a

50
00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.050
life lifer? Who's never worked
a quote unquote real job.

51
00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.400
I've never Someone like, Like
that. I'm sure they exist.

52
00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.370
I have met, you know,
interns and other people that

53
00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.640
we've hired straight from college,
but they're usually like 24

54
00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.040
years old. So they've only
been here a couple of

55
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.580
years. So I'm sure some
exists, but in general. Oh

56
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.030
yeah. Yeah. I really like
it when people, I see

57
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.040
that my favorite Microsoft people
are the ones that leave,

58
00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.590
go and fail at a
startup and then come back.

59
00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.130
Why? Because they have to
then use our tools and

60
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.400
they're always more customer focused.
They go out, they try

61
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.590
to buy our stuff or
license our stuff, they suffer

62
00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.420
and they, they gnashed their
teeth. And they, they come

63
00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.880
back and see if we
can make this better. You

64
00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.740
know, that's why I came
here. That's I think that's

65
00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.040
cool. I respect people who
went out, tried something failed

66
00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.380
and said, all right, I
know why this failed. I'm

67
00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:47.670
going to go back and
I'm going to make something

68
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.430
better. And we always have
fun with those guys. Yeah.

69
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.640
Well who left Google and
come back and yeah, they

70
00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:59.490
definitely have more. Yeah, definitely.
So head performance engineer, that's

71
00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:03.120
a big, that's a big
thing. Performance important engineer that

72
00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.870
doesn't say manager, that's good
head. That's very important. This

73
00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.840
is a very important job
that you have here. Is

74
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.870
this an evangelism thing or
are you literally the head

75
00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.000
performance engineer? And you're focused
on performance if all the

76
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.420
properties and setting the tone
for performance as a value

77
00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.870
at the entire company, it's
Much more evangelism. One of

78
00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.200
the things, when I started
working on performance at Yahoo,

79
00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.950
We did really great work
there. You know, I started

80
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.100
that exceptional performance group and
got why slow out. And

81
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.700
we started doing studies and
blogging and it was going

82
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:43.020
really well. That was a
very successful episode. And, but

83
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.630
towards tortillas. Yeah. And I,
you know, Google was getting

84
00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.270
bigger and stronger. And as
I would bump into these

85
00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.410
people from Google, I got
kind of excited about thinking

86
00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:59.940
about making the move because
people at Google really dug

87
00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.260
scalability and performance and optimization,
just everyone I talked to

88
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.050
and you know, nothing against
Yahoo, but, you know, you

89
00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.880
could tell it was just
part of the culture. And

90
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.250
in fact, I forget what
the, what it is. It's

91
00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.420
like this, you know, seven
tenants of Google or something

92
00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:17.460
like that. There's a webpage
you can find out there

93
00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.760
that talks about, you know,
the core beliefs. And I

94
00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.970
think item number four is
fast as better. So it

95
00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.700
really has been around, you
know, in part of the

96
00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.850
culture from the get go.
And so when I came

97
00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.990
over here, I'm always part
of my well, part of

98
00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.800
my job at Yahoo. And
here has been doing internal

99
00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:43.770
consulting and working with teams
internally, but I get, I

100
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:48.450
don't have Do that much
of it here because literally

101
00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:53.700
everyone is conscious of and
working on performance, not just

102
00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:58.790
engineers, even PMs are thinking
about and messaging that we

103
00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:03.320
just had this blog post
yesterday about. Well, really it

104
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.980
was about mobile optimization in
terms of content, but that

105
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:12.560
translates into faster performance. So
we had this announcement yesterday,

106
00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:16.490
you know, someone working on
ad words for mobile announced

107
00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.310
that Mo you know, sites
that are optimized for mobile

108
00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:23.420
are going to get a
better Edward's quality score and

109
00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:28.520
get more retinue. So like
it's everywhere. And, and that's

110
00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.580
very cool. So as a
result, I don't need to

111
00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:35.330
do as much internal evangelism
here. And so really a

112
00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:39.740
large majority of my job
is so, so there's two

113
00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.990
things about that that I
want to make sure to

114
00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:46.460
mention. One is a vast
majority of my job is,

115
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:49.700
is outward facing. And the
other is I can take

116
00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:53.930
very little credit for the
performance stuff that comes out

117
00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:58.400
of Google cause really it's
coming from all the folks

118
00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.650
that work here. So it
sounds like the, the, they,

119
00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.720
they bought what you're selling,
right. I mean, performance is

120
00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.970
baked into the culture of
Google and now you're trying

121
00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:07.130
to bake it into the
culture of the internet. Everyone

122
00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:12.680
should think about performance. Yeah.
And it's really nice, you

123
00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.230
know, it's really nice that
there are companies like Yahoo

124
00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:19.490
and Google that are big
enough to sponsor someone like

125
00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:21.200
me. I mean, really, I'm
kind of like a research

126
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:26.360
scientist, you know, I'm batsman
for web performance across the

127
00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:31.430
industry and for Google, that
makes a lot of sense.

128
00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:34.520
You know, one like let's
face it, there's a financial

129
00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:38.290
upside. If people spend more
time on the internet and

130
00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:40.940
then they're more engaged than
they'll see more ads and

131
00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:44.390
maybe click on more ads.
And Google's one of, if

132
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:47.360
not the biggest advertiser on
the internet. So there's a

133
00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:52.910
financial upside for making the
web more enjoyable and engaging,

134
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.150
and speed, speed of that
experience of course is going

135
00:07:56.150 --> 00:08:00.820
to make that more likely
to happen. But yeah, It's

136
00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:05.110
also got, you know, maybe
some altruistic benefits. There are

137
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:11.050
studies. I forget who it
was. I can find it,

138
00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:12.730
but there were just some
studies that came out a

139
00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:19.240
few months ago, analyzing internet
infrastructure and adoption of web

140
00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:24.430
technologies across developing regions around
the world. And they're, you

141
00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:28.000
know, they're showing that, you
know, for countries that have,

142
00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:35.470
you know, more internet adoption
jobs and exports double or

143
00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:39.490
something like that, so it
raises the quality of life.

144
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.060
And the other thing that's
really important that I think

145
00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:46.540
all web companies should be
interested in and have a

146
00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:50.290
stake in is the web
stack. You know, the, you

147
00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:53.290
know, as much as we
complain, Alex Russell just wrote a

148
00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:56.820
great blog post this week,
the W3C and how it

149
00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:59.520
should be disbanded. And as
much as you know, I

150
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:05.640
don't enjoy sitting through standards
committee meetings, you know, the

151
00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:12.300
web is pretty cool for
how it functions, given the

152
00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:16.980
different parties and technologies that
are used. And so, and

153
00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:22.050
it's very open. And so
I think any nature, you

154
00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:29.160
know, web publisher, you know,
AOL, Microsoft, Google, Facebook Yahoo,

155
00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:33.210
should be very motivated to
make sure that the open

156
00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:35.970
web stack is the web
stack of choice going forward

157
00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:40.440
for developers and technology companies.
And a big part of

158
00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:45.060
that happening is making sure
that that web stack is

159
00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:49.320
really, really fast and promotes
a good user experience. And

160
00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.660
so, you know, it's really
great that Google is willing

161
00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:55.320
to invest in having me
figure out how to make

162
00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.390
that happen and, and share
that with the rest of

163
00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:01.580
the world, The full lifecycle
of performance is, you know,

164
00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:04.040
it can be everything from
how things are working on

165
00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:06.710
the back end and how
this web service talking to

166
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:09.290
that database or that web
other web service. Then there's

167
00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:12.710
also, I think, kind of
an underappreciated side, which is

168
00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:16.550
the front end performance, the
structuring, the Dom and knowing

169
00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:20.030
how the Dom is perished
and JavaScript performance. There's what

170
00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:23.030
they call perception of speed
performance. Do you focus on,

171
00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:28.190
on front end or backend?
And why? When I started

172
00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:34.370
that PR the performance work
around 2003, 2004, up until

173
00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:36.440
that point, I hadn't done
any front end work at

174
00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:40.700
all. So before that I
had run the, my Yahoo

175
00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:44.450
team at Yahoo, it worked
on the back end user

176
00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:49.790
database, you know, worldwide data,
replication architectures, you know, all

177
00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:54.380
this backend stuff. And I
got asked to start working

178
00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:56.240
on performance, and I assumed,
you know, in all of

179
00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:00.740
my work, just because of
my background and personality was

180
00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:05.180
heavily focused on optimizations. And
so I assumed that when

181
00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:08.480
they meant performance, they meant
back in performance. And when

182
00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:11.510
we set, sat down with
the chief product officer at

183
00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:14.240
the time at Yahoo to
discuss what this group would

184
00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.460
do, he said, Oh, no,
no, no, no. What I'm

185
00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:19.070
talking about is the user
experience performance. I want the

186
00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:22.880
user experience to be faster.
It's not good enough right

187
00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:26.120
now. And that was the
first time that I opened

188
00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:28.700
up a packet sniffer and
I loaded my Yahoo. I

189
00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:33.110
loaded some other popular websites.
And I noticed this incredibly

190
00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:38.540
surprising and humbling and embarrassing
thing that I call the

191
00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:42.680
performance golden rule, which is
less than 10 or 20%

192
00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:45.380
of the overall time that
the user waits for a

193
00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:48.560
website to load is due
to what's happening on the

194
00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:52.820
backend. The other 80 to
90% is what's happening to

195
00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:56.560
transport the resources and to
render the page at the

196
00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:00.370
client. And so up until
that point, I think even

197
00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:04.780
still, when we think about
performance and optimization, we think

198
00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:09.160
of the backend database and
the C plus plus compiler

199
00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:14.470
and the Apache configuration and
our database schema and indexes.

200
00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:18.520
And what I tell people
is you could drive all

201
00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:21.190
of that time does zero
and most users wouldn't even

202
00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:24.400
notice. So what we really
have to do is focus

203
00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:27.520
on this front end part.
If our focus is on

204
00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:33.160
a faster user experience, that
backend performance stuff is still

205
00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.130
really, really important, but it
doesn't affect so much the

206
00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:40.270
user experience. It affects scalability.
So, you know, if you

207
00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:43.630
have millions and millions and
hundreds of millions of users,

208
00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:46.120
you really have to pay
attention to the database in

209
00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:48.160
this season and C plus
plus compilers and all that

210
00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:53.020
other stuff. But it's important
to know the impact of

211
00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:56.260
what you're working on. If
you're working on backend optimization

212
00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:58.600
users, aren't going to notice
you shouldn't look for any

213
00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:02.140
changes there 90% of the
time. You know, if you

214
00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:04.780
want a faster user experience,
don't spend time on the

215
00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:08.200
backend, look in the package,
different and figure out what's

216
00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:10.300
taking the most time and
it's not going to be

217
00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:12.880
something on the back end.
It's going to be JavaScript

218
00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:16.710
or something else that's blocking
the page from loading Tools

219
00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:19.560
exist to figure that stuff
out. I mean, every browser

220
00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:22.080
is different and every job
everybody's got their own JavaScript

221
00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:25.680
implementation, and every browser has
got their own Dom implementation

222
00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:28.440
and HTML renderer. And you're,
you're, you know, you've already

223
00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:30.180
gone straight to packets. Never
is when it comes to

224
00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:32.040
that. I mean, there are
tools like yours, like why

225
00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:35.850
slow, but it seems like
it's an, a very important

226
00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:38.250
thing, but the tools really
aren't there to, to, to

227
00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:40.470
do this. We're, we're still
kind of poking at this

228
00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:45.840
black box with a stick.
No, no, it's not. We're

229
00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:48.840
way past that. Oh my
gosh. We're so far past

230
00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:55.110
that. So, you know, the,
the belief, the hypothesis of,

231
00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:58.500
of these two execs at
Yahoo started this group was

232
00:13:58.770 --> 00:14:02.880
they were great visionaries, Ash
Patel and Jeff Ralston was

233
00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:09.210
they believed that there were
best practices that would come

234
00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:14.100
out about making websites faster.
That would span most all

235
00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:17.100
the properties at Yahoo. So
it wasn't like figuring out

236
00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:19.310
how to make my Yahoo
faster. It was like trying

237
00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:21.780
to figure out how to
make websites faster. And our

238
00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:25.740
hypothesis is that those best
practices will span all the

239
00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:28.800
properties at Yahoo. And not
only was that true, it

240
00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:31.740
turned out that those best
practices apply to almost every

241
00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:35.670
website in the world. And
so, you know, we found

242
00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:39.960
these best practices, like, you
know, get a style sheets

243
00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:42.900
loaded as high up in
the page as possible, and,

244
00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:47.790
you know, reduce HTP requests
by creating sprites and inlining

245
00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:54.770
images with data URS. And
these apply to almost every

246
00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:57.350
website that's out there. And
so once we know the

247
00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:59.570
best practices, the next step
was, you know, I had

248
00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:02.570
these best practices is bottom
line in my mind. And

249
00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:05.540
I would sit down with
development team effort development team,

250
00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:09.200
after development team, open up
a packet, sniffer, look at

251
00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:11.600
it, figure out what they
could do to improve it

252
00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:14.360
and relay it to them.
And I just didn't have

253
00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:16.610
enough time to talk to
every website that was out

254
00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:20.060
there. And so that's when
I created why slow to

255
00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:23.240
try to codify that knowledge
that was in my head.

256
00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:27.110
And so now anyone out
there, you know, why slope

257
00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:31.220
and now the Google equivalent
page speed are available and

258
00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:35.330
anyone can run that on
their site and get a,

259
00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:37.430
basically a to do list
of what they can do

260
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:40.940
to make performance better. And
then now we're, for the

261
00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:44.180
last two years, we've been
moving into the next phase,

262
00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:47.390
which is automation. And so
there are these new web

263
00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:53.330
performance optimization service providers like
Actimize and strange loop networks

264
00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:58.340
and tore, but that are
providing services that will apply

265
00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:04.240
those fix ups to your
website. Automatically This episode of

266
00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:08.170
Hansel minutes is brought to
you by careers. 2.0 careers,

267
00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:10.300
2.0 is a new service
by our friends at stack

268
00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:14.050
overflow. You're probably all familiar
with stack overflow. The online

269
00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:18.970
QA resource dedicated specifically to
programmers and programming related topics.

270
00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:23.050
Well, the team at stack
overflow created careers 2.0 to

271
00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:26.020
provide you with access to
great jobs and introduce you

272
00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:27.850
to a bunch of great
companies that you might consider

273
00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:30.340
working for, even if you're
not currently looking for a

274
00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:35.020
job, think of careers. 2.0
is a programmer profile, gives

275
00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:37.900
you a platform to show
that you're awesome by featuring

276
00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:42.580
your proudest contributions to stack
overflow, GitHub SourceForge Bitbucket, anything

277
00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:45.970
programming related, you can even
add your favorite programming books

278
00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:50.440
from amazon.com profiles on careers.
2.0 are free. They're easy

279
00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:54.970
to get started, especially by
importing your LinkedIn profile. However,

280
00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:59.650
there's one catch profiles on
career 2.0 or invite only

281
00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:02.350
they did this to keep
out the spam and have

282
00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:06.280
a high quality environment. Fortunately,
for you as a Hansel

283
00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:09.280
minutes listener, I've got your
back head on over to

284
00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:15.430
careers dot stack overflow.com/h M
to accept your invitation today,

285
00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:21.700
once again, that's careers dot
stack, overflow.com/h M. I hope

286
00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:24.940
you like it. So, so,
okay. So if the tools

287
00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:28.420
are there and Paige, Paige
bead, and why slow give

288
00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:31.150
the client developer that insight
into their system and a

289
00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:33.940
checklist of what they can
do. And then there's server

290
00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:37.030
side things like, I think
Google page speed is out

291
00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:39.160
now. And you mentioned the
other ones. I know the

292
00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:42.220
guys at strange loop. What
is the browser doing? Like

293
00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.170
if, if it, if it's
so much better to have

294
00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:47.200
CSS at the top, why
don't we just have the

295
00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:49.350
browser pretend that it's at
the top? You know what

296
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:51.630
I'm saying? Like, what's The,
what's the browser's job for

297
00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:57.210
optimization. Yeah, let's see. I
think that's kind of a

298
00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:00.870
big question. I'll try to,
you know, I could say

299
00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:04.740
a couple things about that.
One is, you know, being

300
00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:08.460
at Microsoft and knowing, you
know, <inaudible> been around the

301
00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:12.930
longest and you know, so
it's really hard for IAE

302
00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:18.600
to change behavior that was
cooked into IAE way back

303
00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:22.770
when, because websites have been
built to depend on those

304
00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:26.880
quirks, you know, that's the
whole motivation behind quirks mode.org

305
00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:30.600
is, is tracking those kinds
of nonstandard perks that are

306
00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:34.230
an IAE and have also
been adopted by other browsers,

307
00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:38.850
because there are websites out
there that only function. If

308
00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:44.390
these Quirks are Work the
way they did 10 or

309
00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:50.600
15 years ago. And so
the browser vendors, browser developers

310
00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:55.850
are very, very careful to
not change anything that could

311
00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:58.910
potentially break a website. They
don't want to break a

312
00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:01.730
single website out there. Now,
maybe if it was, you

313
00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:05.600
know, 10 websites across the
entire world, that would be

314
00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:07.940
less of a concern, but,
you know, if they can

315
00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:10.580
find a website that's going
to break because of some

316
00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:15.050
change or optimization that they're
making all the browser vendors

317
00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:18.530
take that very seriously and
try to avoid that even

318
00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:21.830
at the expense of having
quirks in the browser. And

319
00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:25.730
so that's one thing is
it's kind of hard to

320
00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:34.070
enforce these optimizations at a
generic level across every website

321
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:36.800
that exists in the world.
So where we are right

322
00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:38.540
now, there are some things
we can do. Like we

323
00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:43.730
can make JavaScript faster. A
great example is an led

324
00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:47.330
the way it was the
first browser that downloaded scripts

325
00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:50.990
in parallel with other resources.
So it turns out like

326
00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:54.560
there's no reason you can't
do that. Download these bits

327
00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:57.320
and bytes across the network,
Willy nilly, you know, get

328
00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:00.020
them down as soon as
possible. Really all the browser

329
00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:04.370
has to worry about is
executing those bytes of JavaScript

330
00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:08.480
in the appropriate order. As
long as you guarantee execution

331
00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:11.570
order, it really doesn't matter
what order you get the

332
00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:16.310
bites on the, on the
client. And so for whatever

333
00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:18.890
reason, the way that browsers
used to work before IAA

334
00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:23.240
was when you started downloading
the script, it stopped everything

335
00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:26.450
else in the browser. The
browser wouldn't do anything, no

336
00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:30.080
other downloads, no Parsi waiting
for that script to download.

337
00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:33.320
And everyone realized there was
no reason to do that.

338
00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:36.650
And so that was the
safe change that could be

339
00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:40.700
implemented in every browser without
breaking websites. And so the

340
00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:43.550
browsers got on top of
that, but if you move

341
00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:48.070
all the style sheets to
the top, it's possible, there's

342
00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:51.760
one style sheet at the
top that defines a class

343
00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:55.090
and it renders an element.
And there's JavaScript that looks

344
00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:59.200
at the pro style properties
of that element and does

345
00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:01.750
something based on that. And
then later there's another style

346
00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:05.380
sheet that gets downloaded, that
changes that styling, but it's

347
00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:08.230
after the JavaScript has already
executed. And so it doesn't

348
00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:11.800
matter. But if the browser
just said for every website,

349
00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:13.270
I'm going to move all
the style sheets to the

350
00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:17.380
top, that one website out
there would break. And so

351
00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:22.180
for some changes, if it's
deemed safe to apply everywhere,

352
00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:26.230
browsers can do it. But
otherwise what we see with

353
00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:30.460
people, you know, website owners,
either running wise, slow and

354
00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:36.610
making optimizations themselves, they're choosing
to do that. They're self-selecting

355
00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:40.270
to do that. Or a
website will self select to

356
00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:44.170
go through one of these
optimization services. And so they

357
00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:47.410
have done the due diligence
and they own that decision

358
00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:51.730
of applying optimizations to their
website. So that that's kind

359
00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:54.250
of the difference. And I
think where the main boundary

360
00:21:54.250 --> 00:21:57.760
is the main mind between
what a browser can apply

361
00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:00.970
and, and what website owners
have to self select to

362
00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:03.990
buy into. I, I hear
what you're saying and I,

363
00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:06.810
but I put pushing a
little bit just gently to

364
00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:08.910
see if it, if it
actually makes sense to me,

365
00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:12.450
is that why not break
a few websites, right? Let's

366
00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:15.870
say a, you know, they
changed something in MSNBC breaks.

367
00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:18.180
So what they'll fix it,
it's on the server side.

368
00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:21.450
Why not let the, the
voice of the many outweigh

369
00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:24.030
the needs of the one,
right? I mean, a couple

370
00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:26.070
of tens of millions people
get a new browser, they

371
00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:28.350
get a new benefit. One,
one of the millions of

372
00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:30.870
websites, or even 10 per
even if 10% of websites

373
00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:34.560
broke. That implies what you're
saying implies that they're static

374
00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:37.950
resources that they've been forgotten
that they're burnt in Amber

375
00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:40.200
and somehow cannot be updated
by the humans that run

376
00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:43.890
them, let them update their
website. They're not unfixable Entities.

377
00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:50.370
You know, I think coming
from technology companies where a

378
00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:55.110
lot of what we deploy,
you know, we created that

379
00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:58.080
makes sense, but there's a
huge number of companies out

380
00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:01.170
there that are, that rely
on software that they didn't

381
00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:05.370
create and they don't own.
And they can't alter WordPress

382
00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:07.620
is a great example, but
you know, other CMS has

383
00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:11.400
come to mind. And so
like, if you broke some

384
00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:15.330
company that's using a CMS,
and the reason is because

385
00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:19.830
the CMS is doing something
antiquated, you know, that, you

386
00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:23.970
know, a website is like,
well, there's nothing I can

387
00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:27.360
do about that. I'm basically
hosed. And for a lot

388
00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:31.110
of CMS is, you know,
the, the people who created

389
00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:33.750
that might not even be
around anymore, they might not

390
00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:36.900
be able to make the
change. And so, and I

391
00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:41.640
think like if it was
something where the benefit was

392
00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:46.460
very, very visible and very,
very high, like a security

393
00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:50.240
fix, like if we don't
deploy the security fix, there's

394
00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:54.110
a 10% chance you'll lose
all your passwords. People would

395
00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:57.800
be like, okay, I'm okay.
With 10% of the websites

396
00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:00.470
I go to today, not
working because I don't want

397
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:03.800
to lose my passwords, but
if it's gonna make everything

398
00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:08.540
10 or 20% faster by
making this change, but one

399
00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:11.600
out of 10 websites, I
go to don't work, then

400
00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:14.870
I'm not, you know, that's
that trade off is where

401
00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:18.080
it'd be less obvious to
users and they might choose

402
00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:20.600
to switch browsers, or they
might choose to turn off

403
00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:25.310
auto updates. And so, you
know, I think there's in

404
00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:29.960
the browser teams. I think
there's some reluctance to, to

405
00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:32.450
push out changes, even if
they're going to have a

406
00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:37.720
positive impact on performance. I,
I recently updated my, I

407
00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:39.490
had hired a designer and
I had a guy redo

408
00:24:39.490 --> 00:24:42.150
my website. And in the
process I went through and

409
00:24:42.730 --> 00:24:47.590
ran wise low number of
times. And that caused me

410
00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:50.530
to go and do some
bundling and modification of JavaScript

411
00:24:50.530 --> 00:24:54.850
and CSS, which, which was
long, long needed. But I

412
00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:57.250
still think I have a
C or a D and

413
00:24:57.250 --> 00:24:58.930
I look at it and
I say, well, I've got

414
00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:02.730
some ad networks and they're
not cookie lists domains. I

415
00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:05.740
don't want that counted against
it. How much should I

416
00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:08.530
care about my D you
know, should I really, really

417
00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:10.510
make some hard decisions about
what I do to try

418
00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:13.120
to get to a B?
Or if it, if I

419
00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:15.250
make some of the good
changes it suggests, and the

420
00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:17.650
site feels pretty good to
me, then I'll just, you

421
00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:19.330
know, I'll sleep okay at
night that I have a

422
00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:23.530
DNY slow. Yeah. You know,
if you have a B,

423
00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:26.500
like, I think you should
work for an a, but

424
00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:28.670
you can sleep at night.
If you have a D

425
00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:32.440
E you shouldn't be sleeping
the date too. Did you

426
00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:36.790
sleep last night? I slept
fitfully. Oh, okay. Well then

427
00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:41.260
that's okay. Yeah. You just
shouldn't sleep soundly, But people

428
00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:43.030
know, people look at that
as the gospel. I mean,

429
00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:45.100
that's a credit, it's a
report card. Right. And you

430
00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:46.840
could come home with all
A's, but your dad's going

431
00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:50.260
to be like, what's that?
That's a, yeah. Yeah. How

432
00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:53.650
seriously do we take this
stuff? Yeah. I mean, it's

433
00:25:53.650 --> 00:25:56.200
really important. There are all
these case studies you can

434
00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:58.540
find in my, almost every
talk I do now starts

435
00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:01.300
with a bunch of case
studies. You know, you're going

436
00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:04.960
to get, I mean, it
depends on from site to

437
00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:07.780
site, but you're going to
get some really positive lift

438
00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:11.200
in the metrics that you
care about, whether that's conversions

439
00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:17.620
a cart size page views
per user per session, whatever

440
00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:20.140
it is, you're going to
get significant lift in those,

441
00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:23.470
you know, significant as, you
know, five to 20% lift

442
00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:27.160
in those metrics, if the
website is faster. And so

443
00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:31.240
it does matter. And so
going from a, you know,

444
00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:35.020
a D is pretty bad.
And you know, what, what

445
00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:39.970
I always think about is,
you know, maybe the site

446
00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:44.280
doesn't seem that bad right
now, but there are also

447
00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:49.260
people and with, you know,
laptops or mobile devices or

448
00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:54.660
internet connections that are much
worse than what you're using.

449
00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:58.020
And for those people, it
is very noticeable. And there's

450
00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:00.750
also a, you know, a
new startup around the corner

451
00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:05.130
or a new blogger or
whatever it is who's coming

452
00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:08.460
up right behind you. And
so, you know, I think

453
00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:11.970
it's really important to provide
that fast experience. And I'm

454
00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:15.540
glad, you know, that folks
like Fred Wilson and Mary

455
00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:21.420
Meeker who have much more
clout than I do feel

456
00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:25.500
the same way. And, and
yeah, I think it's important

457
00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:28.200
for a company on the
web. You know, there's, there

458
00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:31.320
are definitely more important things,
you know, if, if you

459
00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:35.790
can't scale to more than
10,000 users, you gotta work

460
00:27:35.790 --> 00:27:38.970
on, you know, scalability and
an uptime. You know, if

461
00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:41.550
you have 90% uptime, that's
not acceptable, you've got to

462
00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:46.440
work on uptime. You got
to be conscientious of security

463
00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:51.270
and, and user privacy, you
know, bugs if the site

464
00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:54.000
is fast, but people can't
send an email, it doesn't

465
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.700
matter that it's fast. You
know, so functionality is important,

466
00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:59.100
but once you get on
top of those, you know,

467
00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:05.880
security, availability, scalability functionality, performance
is the next thing to

468
00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:09.020
focus on. But if I've
got a blog, let's say

469
00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:10.880
that's not a company site.
I can see getting a

470
00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:12.680
B or an a on
a company site because that,

471
00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:15.530
that, that makes sense. But
a blog or something, can

472
00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:18.830
I go and use some
web accelerator, maybe explain what

473
00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:20.720
those are, maybe I'll use
Google page speed, and I'll

474
00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:24.170
just run my blog through
that. Or is that a

475
00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:28.370
solution to the average person's
the midsize business and smaller,

476
00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:32.300
or the average blogger in
smaller problem? Yeah. I've got

477
00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:34.550
two things to say about
that. One was, you know,

478
00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:37.250
when Google first announced about
a year and a half

479
00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:40.970
ago that we were going
to take a website latency

480
00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:46.100
or, or speed and consideration
and page ranking people, you

481
00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:50.000
know, some of the complaints
about that were that, you

482
00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.040
know, this was going to
favor the big companies. And

483
00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:54.860
I feel just the opposite.
I feel like someone who,

484
00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:57.290
you know, a mom and
pop or, or someone who

485
00:28:57.290 --> 00:29:02.900
owns a blog is much
more able to deploy changes

486
00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:08.840
more quickly and get their
performance up more easily. So,

487
00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:11.030
and I, you know, I
bet you would share being,

488
00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:14.690
being two guys who come
from big companies, you know,

489
00:29:14.690 --> 00:29:17.990
how difficult it is to,
to, you know, make fast

490
00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:21.410
progress inside a big company
to production websites, you know,

491
00:29:21.410 --> 00:29:24.830
that can be very time
consuming with all the testing

492
00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:28.850
and, and push process that
has to go on for

493
00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:32.450
that. So, you know, that's,
that's one response to that

494
00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:36.020
is I think for smaller
sites, it's actually easier to

495
00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:40.190
deploy those kind of performance
optimization changes, but the other

496
00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:43.270
is, yeah, it's going through
these accelerators, I think is

497
00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:46.780
a great way to do
that. Especially if the website

498
00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:49.540
owner is, you know, didn't
write the webs, didn't build

499
00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:53.350
the website themselves is not
a programmer, or especially if

500
00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:58.390
they're using some CMS again,
like a blog platform, they

501
00:29:58.390 --> 00:30:02.170
can run it through one
of these accelerator companies. And,

502
00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:04.450
and so, yeah, just to
talk about that really quick,

503
00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:08.050
w w when they first
came out, they were, you

504
00:30:08.050 --> 00:30:11.650
know, like an Apache module
or a network appliance that

505
00:30:11.650 --> 00:30:16.090
you could install between your
users and your web server.

506
00:30:17.770 --> 00:30:21.550
And, but then about a
year ago, we started seeing

507
00:30:21.550 --> 00:30:26.380
these cloud implementations come out.
And so basically what you

508
00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:29.500
would do is you would
change your DNS to point

509
00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:33.700
to one of these accelerator
services. And then the accelerator

510
00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:37.960
service works as a reverse
proxy, and they will proxy

511
00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:41.500
your website. And as it
comes through, they will apply

512
00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:45.730
the fix ups so that
the user gets a optimized

513
00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:51.910
site. So in addition to
having the content be optimized,

514
00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:57.490
most of these accelerators have
a better geographic presence and

515
00:30:57.550 --> 00:31:00.610
a smaller mom and pop
or blogger would have. And

516
00:31:00.610 --> 00:31:03.640
so you'll get those benefits
of like a CDN surface

517
00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:09.180
of being, having a better
global presence And do those

518
00:31:09.210 --> 00:31:10.950
change. I mean, those all
are those only for static

519
00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:12.870
sites. I mean, my blog
is like, for example, a

520
00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:15.270
lot of comments, I would
be afraid if I put

521
00:31:15.270 --> 00:31:17.580
an intermediary between us, that
it would become less dynamic

522
00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:25.320
of a site. No, they,
you know, it's, you know,

523
00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:29.460
if you, if you look
the number of HTTP requests

524
00:31:29.550 --> 00:31:34.710
that people have to make
to download your site of

525
00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:38.070
those HTP requests that are
dynamic, it's probably like less

526
00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:43.500
than 10%, probably less than
2%. And so, you know,

527
00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:46.410
even though that dynamic requests
now has to take an

528
00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:48.870
extra hop, to go through
the proxy, to your origin

529
00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:53.070
server and back through the
acceleration, or by having the

530
00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:56.970
content accelerated and the rest
of the HTTP requests accelerated

531
00:31:57.300 --> 00:31:59.730
is gonna more than make
up for it. And then

532
00:31:59.730 --> 00:32:02.580
if you look at these
services, they all have the

533
00:32:02.610 --> 00:32:09.180
expected configuration options to, you
know, have like thinking cash

534
00:32:09.210 --> 00:32:13.140
by at the minute also
what they'll do automatically, most

535
00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:15.030
of them, at least all
the ones I'm aware of

536
00:32:15.390 --> 00:32:22.160
is they'll, they don't necessarily,
you know, do the request

537
00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:27.420
to your origin server on
demand. They're, you know, prefetching

538
00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:30.540
that in the background. So
it's at fixed intervals and

539
00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:32.910
a lot of them, you
can configure this or they'll

540
00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:36.750
learn the behavior, they'll learn
how often your website changes.

541
00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:39.410
And so they'll set, you
know, a ping rate every

542
00:32:39.410 --> 00:32:43.100
five seconds or every 45
seconds, they'll check the origin

543
00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:45.920
server and see if there
were any updates. So it

544
00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:48.860
works pretty well. That's pretty
slick. And do you think

545
00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:52.070
that this is gonna become
a big thing? Like, or

546
00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:53.450
is it, will this always
be kind of a niche?

547
00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:56.270
I think it's going to
become a big thing, but

548
00:32:56.270 --> 00:32:59.660
I think it's going to
go beyond performance, I think.

549
00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:02.510
And in fact, there are
some people like CloudFlare that

550
00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:05.660
are already doing this. If
you think about it, there's

551
00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:09.500
a ton of these fix
ups that could be applied

552
00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:15.230
to a website. In addition
to performance improvements, you could

553
00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:19.910
do things with SEO, you
could do things for security,

554
00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:24.410
you could do things for
internationalization. And so I think

555
00:33:24.410 --> 00:33:26.390
we're just at the beginning
of this. And in fact,

556
00:33:26.390 --> 00:33:31.250
I think something that would
be very exciting to start

557
00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:35.960
working on is I think
we're going to need some,

558
00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:43.550
some specification for how these
fix-up modules can interact with

559
00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:46.370
each other, because what we're
eventually going to get to

560
00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:50.030
is these fixed subs are
going to be commodities. I

561
00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:52.340
w I want the Y
slow set of fix ups.

562
00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:54.920
No, I want the page
speed set of fix ups.

563
00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:58.280
No, I want the, you
know, strange loop set of

564
00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:01.250
fix ups, and I want
the SEO fix ups from

565
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.840
this party or this party.
And so you're going to

566
00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:09.080
have these, I think these,
you know, reverse proxy cloud

567
00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:11.990
services are a great way
to do that, especially for,

568
00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:14.120
you know, you're never going
to have an Amazon run

569
00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:17.600
through one of these reverse
proxy, third party services, but

570
00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:22.520
for, you know, mid tier
to smaller website owners, that

571
00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:25.580
would make a lot of
sense. And I think we're

572
00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:29.120
going to see this where
it's going to become a

573
00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:32.450
column, a column B thing.
I can pick the fix

574
00:34:32.450 --> 00:34:36.080
ups and optimizations that I
want from this reverse proxy

575
00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:40.250
service and the reverse proxy
services that provide the most

576
00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:45.410
powerful and widest variety of
fix ups to apply are

577
00:34:45.410 --> 00:34:48.170
going to be the winners.
It sounds like it's going

578
00:34:48.170 --> 00:34:50.420
to get a lot easier,
but at the same time,

579
00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:51.920
it seems like it's gonna
be a lot more complex.

580
00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:53.990
I mean, this is definitely
one more thing people need

581
00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:56.600
to be thinking about if
they're not already, it seems

582
00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:59.270
like an obvious thing to
think about performance, but can,

583
00:34:59.270 --> 00:35:00.950
it kind of seems like
people are just throwing websites

584
00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:02.510
up there and not even
giving a thought, are they?

585
00:35:04.930 --> 00:35:12.250
Yeah, I don't, I don't,
Yeah. I guess the big

586
00:35:12.250 --> 00:35:14.110
sites do, but it just
seems to me like the

587
00:35:14.110 --> 00:35:16.390
average, like your dentist, local
dentist office, he doesn't think

588
00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:18.100
about things like that. And
he shouldn't, he should just

589
00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:23.590
push the, make it faster
button. Yeah. Yeah. I hate

590
00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:27.520
to say it, but I
agree with you. That's always,

591
00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:30.940
that's always a good place
to end. The podcast is,

592
00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:34.000
you know, like, like I,
my site's hosted on dream

593
00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.400
host. And if you go
to a dream house now

594
00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:38.520
to host your there's actually
a check box, you can

595
00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:43.020
check that says, apply the
page speed, fix ups. So

596
00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:46.450
nice. How many people checked
that box? Probably, you know,

597
00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:50.490
a vast minority, but after
that's been out for a

598
00:35:50.490 --> 00:35:52.860
year or two, and it
doesn't cause any of those

599
00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:55.800
websites to break, maybe instead
of opting in, you have

600
00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:58.710
to opt out. And so
the dentist who spins up

601
00:35:58.710 --> 00:36:00.840
a website off of dream
posts will get those fix

602
00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:04.320
ups automatically without even asking
for it. And so, you

603
00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:06.750
know, I think we're still
in the early stages of

604
00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:10.770
this, but certainly the tools
and techniques are gonna harden

605
00:36:10.770 --> 00:36:14.100
and, and get better as
time goes by. Very cool.

606
00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:15.690
Well, thank you so much,
Steve, for chatting with me

607
00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:19.470
today, that was really interesting.
And I was honored when

608
00:36:19.590 --> 00:36:23.190
I got your pink to
be on Hansel minutes. I've

609
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:27.300
been checking some of the
past podcasts and they've all

610
00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:30.270
been really interesting and, and
it was a pleasure to

611
00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:33.300
be invited on, have this
conversation with you, Scott. I

612
00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:36.660
hope we can do it
again soon. Alright. This has

613
00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:39.210
been another episode of Hansel
minutes. We'll see you again

614
00:36:39.210 --> 00:36:47.030
next week. <inaudible>.
