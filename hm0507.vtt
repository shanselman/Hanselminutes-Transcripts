00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:04.200
Do you know, Swift objective
C and Java. Can you

2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.110
use them in tools like
X code or Android studio?

3
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.800
If so awesome. But for
everyone else, there's native script

4
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:15.300
to cross platform framework for
building native iOS and Android

5
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:20.670
apps using skills, you already
have JavaScript or TypeScript CSS,

6
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.590
and XAML like XML, markup.
Start building your dream native

7
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.400
mobile apps today. Use the
native script command line interface

8
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.730
for free or use native
script in visual studio with

9
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.970
a Tellerik platform subscription, which
will enable you to build

11
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.540
It's Hanselman. It's a weekly
discussion with web developer and

12
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.580
technologist Scott Hanselman. This is
Lawrence Ryan announcing your show number

13
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.040
507. In this episode, Scott
talks with Irene Ross about

14
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:21.150
data visualization. Hi, this is
Scott Hanselman. This is another

15
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.640
episode of Hansel minutes. And
today I'm talking with Irene

16
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.300
Ross. She's a data visualization
expert and a specialist at

17
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.230
Boku on the topic of
data visualization. So you have

18
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.600
been doing data visualization since
you're in your entire career.

19
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.050
This has been your focus,
has it not? Yeah, just

20
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:41.120
about, I actually started being
a, just the software engineer

21
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.600
at IBM and I happened
to stumble into an internal

22
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.650
talk from a group of
researchers that were doing some

23
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.410
really interesting work around a
project called mini eyes, which

24
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.440
was kind of like a
YouTube for data visualization. And

25
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.470
I was so fascinated and
excited and cause I had

26
00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.590
never really seen data visualization
before or thought about it

27
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.530
as a discipline. It was
just kind of there. And

28
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.050
suddenly I thought, Oh, I
could be doing this instead.

29
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.960
And I weaseled my way
in, and that was about

30
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.360
almost 10 years ago and
I've been doing it since

31
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.170
Many eyes was a project
at IBM. That was like

32
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.040
revolutionary. And it recently closed
at stores, I think in

33
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.280
June of this year. Yeah.
From what I can tell,

34
00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.070
I certainly have been a
little bit out of the

35
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.280
loop, but it does look
that way. It's been through

36
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.850
a lot of really interesting
evolutions and it was kind

37
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.040
of fun to see and
be a part of it.

38
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.590
Especially in the beginning when
I joined it was actually

39
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.790
being rewritten because it was
getting too much traffic than

40
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.390
too much attention and the
infrastructure we had couldn't sustain

41
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.420
it. It was kind of
a research prototype that became

42
00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.630
really huge. And so we
got, should we write it?

43
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.060
And then a lot of
the visualizations were written in

44
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.510
Java and as you know,
on the web Java is

45
00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.440
been a little bit harder
to work with sure. Many

46
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.260
experienced the applets that no
longer run. And some of

47
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.410
them were also flashed. So
the same story. And so

48
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.290
by the time that I
had left, it was kind

49
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.540
of being picked up and
moved around to kind of

50
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.330
try to actually productize it
and turn it into something

51
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:18.250
more real. And I believe
that recently it's been transformed

52
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.860
to being much more web
friendly, but I don't know

53
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.660
exactly the full story behind
with the plans are I

54
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.870
watch it from the sidelines
and which it will. Yeah.

55
00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.910
It looks like as a
free service, it's kind of

56
00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.610
gone away as an individual
concept, but now it's IBM

57
00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.520
Watson analytics. So it's becoming
part of the Watson family

58
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.760
of IBM stuff. So hopefully
many eyes or the idea

59
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.780
of collaborative visualization will live
on. Absolutely. Yeah. And we've

60
00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.350
seen lots of exciting projects
that have come up. I

61
00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.360
don't want to say as
a result directly, but certainly

62
00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.240
inspired by that and a
really big surgery that is

63
00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.810
actually happening in journalism, where
we see a lot, a

64
00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.430
lot more interactive visualizations being
used as part of traditional

65
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.520
storytelling. And those folks need
those same kinds of tools.

66
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.350
They have data. They want
to be able to create

67
00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.640
graphics when quickly it can't
always be, you know, incredibly

68
00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.210
detailed and super interactive. Sometimes
you just need a small

69
00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:13.860
chart to go along with
things. And so there's lots

70
00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.070
of really cool tools that
folks have been writing that

71
00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.640
are sores that companies can
deploy and actually using their

72
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.970
infrastructure. It seems like in
the, in my career as

73
00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.210
a software engineer, Viola visualization,
I think starts with the

74
00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.790
pie chart. Like I know
that that might, that might

75
00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.580
offend an expert, you know,
in this space, but I'm,

76
00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.490
I'm, I apologize ahead of
time, but you know, that

77
00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.380
that sense of achievement that
one has when they make

78
00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.820
their first pie chart, but
it seems like the ramping

79
00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.090
up from there is a
little bit steep. Where's the

80
00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.280
OnRamps do I need to
go read books by Edward

81
00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.930
Tufty to start really thinking
about data visualization? That's a

82
00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.620
really excellent question. I think
today's books are absolutely beautiful.

83
00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.620
And in terms of just
getting excited about the potential

84
00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.300
of data visualization, they absolutely
get you there. Cause you're

85
00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.210
going to get to see
an overview of really fun

86
00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:11.220
historic visualization. And there's certainly
lots of opinions just mixed

87
00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.100
in there for you to
kind of start figuring out

88
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:17.250
what your style is. But,
you know, I think there's

89
00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.730
definitely a lot of perceptions
around what data is good

90
00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:23.100
data that is not good
database with our pie chart

91
00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.410
is good or bad. I
don't so much subscribe to

92
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.920
that because I think all
data, this has its place.

93
00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:31.770
You know, sometimes a pie
chart is just, is enough.

94
00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.070
Sometimes you don't need anything
too crazy or much more

95
00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:39.330
complicated than that. And so,
you know, I'll probably start

96
00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.250
is a great start. A
lot of, a lot of

97
00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.280
folks come to data visualization
from Excel and a lot

98
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.160
of people work in cell
phone really long time. And

99
00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.530
it's a great tool for
a lot of the tasks

100
00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:52.350
that people have to do.
So, you know, and it

101
00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:54.840
provides just enough facilities for
you to often make a

102
00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.940
lot of sense of who
you're working with. And then

103
00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.300
it starts getting a little
bit more complicated. So if

104
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.090
you're realizing that there are
certain charts that you're making

105
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:03.920
over and over and over
again, and wouldn't it be

106
00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.840
great if you just had
a server and you could

107
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.780
pipe that data back and
render them on the website

108
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:11.870
to share with everybody instead
of sending sales spreadsheets around.

109
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:15.080
Well, that's when he actually
started building things a little

110
00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.980
bit more accustomed and there's
still even libraries that you

111
00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:21.950
could use that are source
that provide some of the

112
00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:25.010
basic charting capability that you
see in Excel, you know,

113
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:28.370
your bar charts or scatterplots
your pie charts, things like

114
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:31.640
that. And I think the
complexity really comes up when

115
00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.850
you're starting to realize that,
Oh, wouldn't it be great

116
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:37.190
if you clicked on that
thing and this other thing

117
00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:40.100
happened, and you said this
other visualization, maybe wanting to

118
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.140
coordinate a bunch of them
so that you kind of

119
00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:47.210
have this much more robust
filtering mechanism. And that's when

120
00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:49.310
I think you start seeing
people come up with really

121
00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:51.920
crazy layouts, you know, a
tree map inside of the

122
00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.800
bar graph inside of, you
know, and those are really

123
00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.400
fun, but I think, you
know, they're also very specific

124
00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.530
and not everybody needs them.
Yeah. Th that gap though,

125
00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:05.680
to jump from a static
chart or static visualization, something

126
00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:08.110
that I, you know, when
I started, I generated these

127
00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:11.200
things as PNGs or gifts
on the server side, that

128
00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:14.920
jump to interactivity, something as
simple as a filter. And

129
00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:17.020
it still delights the user
though. Like if you have

130
00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:19.780
a dropdown that then changes
something, we don't want to

131
00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:22.240
just generate a new graphic,
we want it to animate

132
00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.460
on the way there to
give you a sense of

133
00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:28.510
change. So adding that, that
dimension of time. Yeah, absolutely.

134
00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:33.490
I do think that animation
adds a lot to, to

135
00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.950
grab some of the, especially
on the web that equals

136
00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:38.140
folks. When they see charts,
they kind of expect to

137
00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:40.270
be able to at least
hover on them, get a

138
00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:42.430
little bit more information, but
then also interact with them

139
00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:46.270
in more interesting ways. And
that transition definitely brings with

140
00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:49.990
it a lot more complexity.
But I think some of

141
00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:51.640
the libraries that we have
today make it a lot

142
00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:55.540
easier. A lot of both
charting libraries that have prebuilt

143
00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:58.960
components try to expose various
kinds of events. We hope

144
00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:02.980
to be able to wire
in, in, into certain events.

145
00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:07.090
And then at the same
time when you're creating new

146
00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:11.560
visualizations using, you know, standard
on components like SVG, for

147
00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:14.020
example, or even this, I
mean, I've seen lots of

148
00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:17.110
visualizations just done with straight
up HTML and it's, you

149
00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:19.960
know, you can use the
standard browser events system to

150
00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:22.030
really be able to hook
in and change things around.

151
00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:26.890
So, So you are the
director of data visualization at,

152
00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:30.280
at Boku. And I think
that, that that's really significant

153
00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:33.340
because by, by saying that
that is your title by

154
00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:35.860
having the title of director
of data visualization, it's a

155
00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:38.860
declaration on behalf, not just
of your company, but as

156
00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:42.700
an, as an industry, that
this is a, a specific

157
00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:47.440
and valued practice within the
practice of software creation. You

158
00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.790
know what I mean? You're
not, you're not just like,

159
00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:51.940
Oh, go ask Irene she's.
She messes with charts over

160
00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:56.640
there. This is a, this
is a very specific skill.

161
00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:00.360
And I remember struggling to
get a QA department. I

162
00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.820
think it's so wonderful that
there's a formalized kind of

163
00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:06.120
like department around data visualization.
Is that something that other

164
00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:09.530
companies should be looking at?
Yeah, I mean, I absolutely

165
00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:13.040
think so. It's been a
really exciting year for us.

166
00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.860
I, I'm almost humbled at
the amount of interest that

167
00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:17.780
we're seeing from people, but
in a lot of ways,

168
00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:20.510
that makes sense to me
because we've gotten really good

169
00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:23.300
at building software for the
web. And because of that,

170
00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:26.390
we've gotten really good at
collecting data. And the moment

171
00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:28.760
you have data, you want
to make it actionable. There's

172
00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.250
no reason not to, you
know, a lot of times

173
00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:33.500
we make decisions based on
our gut feeling. And suddenly

174
00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:36.030
we now have data that
we can make use of.

175
00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:38.390
And as soon as folks
try to do that, they

176
00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:41.420
realize, Oh, this is an
entire discipline data science data

177
00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:44.480
analysis. There are things that
you have to be able

178
00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.670
to do and know how
to do. And once you

179
00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:49.580
analyze your data, you want
to communicate that in some

180
00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:52.400
way that will really enable
the conversation and not just

181
00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:54.860
lead folks kind of looking
at a bunch of numbers

182
00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:57.710
and wondering, well, what does
that mean? So I think

183
00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:00.290
that it's just really very
much the next step for

184
00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:01.880
a lot of what we're
doing. And we see a

185
00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:05.150
lot of companies that have
implemented this incredibly well. You

186
00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:08.840
know, I always talk about
Netflix because their entire business

187
00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:12.590
model is data-driven their data.
First company, they have all

188
00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:15.350
your history, all your behavior.
And in a lot of

189
00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:17.570
ways, they know exactly what
it is you're going to

190
00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:20.450
watch and what you're going
to enjoy. And, you know,

191
00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:22.280
when you look for example,
at the programs that they're

192
00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:25.070
starting to offer, people love
the shows that they put

193
00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:28.700
together. And those are very
much a consequence of really

194
00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:31.490
looking at the data that
they have. So I'm really

195
00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:35.000
excited to see more and
more people understand that and

196
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:38.600
acknowledge that, just looking at
data and using it both

197
00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.090
for insight and communication is
going to be a really

198
00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:44.630
powerful tool in nursing. Where
is the intersection of the

199
00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:49.550
practice of, of data visualization
at the company versus user

200
00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:52.970
experience and then design, is
there like a Venn diagram?

201
00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:56.200
See here, I am trying
to design some visualization like

202
00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.430
w cause you've got UX
and UI, right? You've got

203
00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:01.820
designers and then you've got
you. How do you all

204
00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:05.600
work? Oh, it's the, it's
the best collaboration ever. I'm

205
00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:09.230
so glad you asked that.
So we follow very much

206
00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:13.040
a user research driven approach
to the way that we

207
00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.440
work with projects. And a
lot of the times that

208
00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:18.800
means that during our discovery
phase, we will have both

209
00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:22.430
more traditional designers. So who's
doing the user research and

210
00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:27.680
persona development and really understanding
what the stakeholders have to

211
00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:29.600
say and what they need.
And then we also have

212
00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:32.360
someone who is working on
the data visualization and the

213
00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:37.850
prevailing on the data analysis
and context gathering, and maybe

214
00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:40.580
a little bit of prototyping.
And so that person will

215
00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:42.740
sort of, you know, figure
out what the what's, the

216
00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:45.050
data that folks have, what
questions they need to be

217
00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:49.580
asking. Can we answer it
with the data we're finding,

218
00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:52.070
even making sense to people.
So there's kind of this

219
00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:54.760
back and forth from both
ends and go. These processes

220
00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:57.370
inform each other a lot.
So for example, if we

221
00:11:57.370 --> 00:11:58.990
know that we want to
do a very data driven

222
00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:01.870
interface, you know, we can
go and crunch some numbers

223
00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:03.610
and then go back to
our designer and say, here's

224
00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:06.190
what we're finding you, you
know, go talk to the

225
00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:09.100
folks, students make sense or
not. You know, how about

226
00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:11.800
we think of these wireframes
and this other way. So

227
00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:14.140
it's definitely a process that
is, I think, has been

228
00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:17.410
new to us this year.
Something that as we're just

229
00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:20.380
been building more and more
intricate and complex data driven

230
00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:24.130
tools, but we find that
it ends up filling both

231
00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:26.860
of the gaps in both
of our processes so much

232
00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:29.800
better. So our designer has
a being much more informed

233
00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:33.160
by actual factual data. And
we are so much more

234
00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.550
informed because we have a
better understanding of our stakeholders.

235
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.540
So that that process is
something I'm super excited about.

236
00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:44.410
Actually, I'll be, I'll be
speaking about it and the

237
00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:47.830
strata conference in, I think,
March of next year. So

238
00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:51.190
I'm pretty excited to share
more about how we probably

239
00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:54.180
do it. So it really
is quite formal, right? I

240
00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:56.670
mean, it's not just a,
like sometimes I feel in

241
00:12:56.670 --> 00:13:01.440
small companies, design is the
designer is talented and we

242
00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:03.780
trust the designer and the
designer does what the designer

243
00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:07.590
does, but you really are
doing, you know, AB C

244
00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:10.170
through Z testing to make
sure that this really is

245
00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:16.320
scientifically the appropriate visualization. We,
well, I wouldn't, I wouldn't

246
00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:18.840
say that it's as rigorous.
And I think sometimes it

247
00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:21.030
also depends on the complexity
of the data that we're

248
00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:24.660
operating with. Not all the
questions we ask are so

249
00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:26.730
complex that we have to
do that much testing. A

250
00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:30.000
lot of the times, some
of our initial gut feelings

251
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.950
will, will pan out to
be right, if not the

252
00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:34.680
first, the second or third.
And we'll kind of go

253
00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:38.190
from that, but it's definitely
somewhat formalized in that we,

254
00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:41.610
we know when we're missing
something and we'll know that

255
00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:43.740
it's really important for us
to ask a lot of

256
00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:48.000
questions and we'll do a
lot of verification with the

257
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.400
folks we're talking to to
make sure we're on the

258
00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:53.310
right track. Obviously the last
thing anybody wants is first

259
00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:55.470
to go with the wrong
thing. And I think this

260
00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:59.610
year was also exciting for
us because we really got

261
00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:03.390
to see the experience and
see the full potential of

262
00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:08.100
having kind of a full
UX practice versus I think

263
00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:10.470
what maybe more traditionally folks
consider when they think about

264
00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:13.170
web design, which is like
someone making their buttons and

265
00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:16.370
putting them in the right
place. And that's kind of

266
00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:19.530
a misconception that we, we,
you know, are excited to

267
00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:22.920
share with people because our,
this design has been such

268
00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:26.100
a core part of our
practice. And we built just

269
00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:31.200
much, much better products with
people. Hey folks, I wanted

270
00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:33.960
to take a moment to
tell you about Reagan and

271
00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:36.810
their new product called pulse.
Reagan is an error and

272
00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:40.830
crash reporting software provider and
their new product pulse. It's

273
00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:44.220
a realtime user monitoring product.
It gives you performance data

274
00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:48.180
and user insights. Lets you
understand exactly what's happening when

275
00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:51.090
users interact with your software.
So you're never left guessing.

276
00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:54.650
Reagan provides you with the
answers to your performance questions

277
00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:58.190
and they've found over 10 billion
that's billion with a B

278
00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:01.940
bugs and customer apps with
their crash reporting product. And

279
00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:05.300
now Reagan will help you
understand application quality. Like no

280
00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:09.350
one else over 30,000 developers
worldwide, can't be wrong. I

281
00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:11.180
use Reagan and all the
time and I enjoy it

282
00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:13.610
very much. You can try

free today@reagan.io. So many eyes

285
00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:31.430
was I believe in 2007.
So I feel like if

286
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:34.780
we Mark that as the
beginning of the, the, the

287
00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:38.090
uptick of the, you know,
the hockey stick of enthusiasm

288
00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:41.960
around visualization on the net,
what do you think? What

289
00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:45.440
are some examples of where
data visualization really like got

290
00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:48.920
the attention of more than
just, you know, the small

291
00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:51.770
subculture of data visualizers? I
feel like there's the New York

292
00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:56.330
times visualization team and then
Nate silver is five 38

293
00:15:57.770 --> 00:16:02.020
statistics website. What do you
think? Yeah, I mean, I

294
00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:06.430
absolutely agree. Both of those
institutions have had so much

295
00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:09.940
impact on our community and
they continue to, I mean,

296
00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:13.540
everyone looks thinner times and
they always innovate so fast

297
00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:16.780
in terms of just the
types of visualizations they make.

298
00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:22.690
I've definitely seen that become
a more common communication pattern.

299
00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:26.230
You know, I'll have, you
know, friends who just expect

300
00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:29.440
it more. There was recently
kind of a very interesting

301
00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:32.830
actually motion graphic piece that
kind of went and stepped

302
00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:37.060
through of this brilliant ticket
visualization of, I believe it

303
00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:40.090
was world world war II.
And I was really amazed

304
00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:42.190
to just see it show
up in all kinds of

305
00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:45.490
contexts, not just in the
data. This community was very

306
00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:50.620
much talked about in the
story and community and other

307
00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:53.440
places and the film community
kind of jumped on it.

308
00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:55.990
So it was really interesting
and no one talked about

309
00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:58.570
it as, Oh wow. Look
at this data visualization piece.

310
00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:01.810
And I think that's one
of the things that sometimes

311
00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:04.630
maybe surprising, but I hope
for us is that people

312
00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:07.900
stop talking about us as
like a subfield and just

313
00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:11.440
talk about the content that
we produce. And I think

314
00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:14.110
that ends up confirming itself.
When you just look at

315
00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:16.840
some sort of a data
visualization piece and you don't

316
00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:19.720
really think about the color
or the layout, you actually

317
00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:21.940
really dig into the story
and kind of forget that

318
00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:25.630
everything else was there. And
I consider that success for

319
00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:29.830
better or worse, but we've,
we kinda actually, we're really

320
00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:34.060
lucky this year to produce
this project called Stereotropes, which

321
00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:38.380
was looking at TV tropes.
And we're really interested in

322
00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:41.560
when people were describing tropes
that appeared film and other

323
00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:45.670
media. And we built this
project called Stereotropes and we

324
00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:49.060
got a lot of really
interesting conversations from folks completely

325
00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:53.160
of the technical community because
we, we talked about gender

326
00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:56.130
and then the gender is
represented through natural language processing.

327
00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:59.490
And it was really nice
because it was, you know,

328
00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:01.800
fairly unbiased analysis. And then
we just kind of, according

329
00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:03.870
to what we saw and
we got all kinds of

330
00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:08.190
folks chatting with that scrum,
the humidity's from that community

331
00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:10.620
itself, we're really thrilled that
they were excited about our

332
00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:14.370
work. And I really appreciate
being able to share this

333
00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:17.400
discipline with other people. Digital
humanities is one place where

334
00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:21.030
there's a huge increase in,
in that there's good new

335
00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:25.380
events popping up everywhere. Folks
were working in history and

336
00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:28.170
geography and things like that
are starting to really make

337
00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:30.570
use of these tools and
some really creative ways. So

338
00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:33.620
I watched to see what
they're doing For people who

339
00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:35.420
are listening, who might not
be familiar with that word

340
00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:39.680
tropes. It's kind of like
a, you know, a cliche

341
00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:42.350
that you see repeated time
and time and time again.

342
00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:45.170
And there's this really wonderful
cycle TV tropes that you

343
00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:48.560
can go check out, but
the TV tropes the website

344
00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:51.110
as lovely as it is,
is largely kind of a

345
00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:56.210
classic text-based Wiki. And if
you go to stereo tropes,

346
00:18:56.210 --> 00:19:00.470
T R O P E
s.boku.com, you'll get a much,

347
00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:03.770
almost like a visual as
a viewer of TV tropes

348
00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:06.550
content. But what's so surprising
about it is that you

349
00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:08.780
look around and you go,
this is a, a pleasantly

350
00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:12.500
organized site and it has
some nice visualizations, but then

351
00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:15.320
you do a mouseover and
then suddenly the page just

352
00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:17.900
kind of comes to life.
And then data starts getting

353
00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:21.860
connected in a way that
you wouldn't necessarily expect words,

354
00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:24.590
start having lines drawn to
them. And then you start

355
00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:28.550
realizing that this is a
much superior way to explore

356
00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:32.570
a Wiki of, of content.
It's really an exceptional example

357
00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:36.410
that people should check out.
Thank you. That's really, that's

358
00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:39.680
really kind of your thing.
Yeah. It's, it's like you

359
00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.780
see something fresh or new
like this and you're like,

360
00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:44.870
Oh, I want to do
that. You know, I want,

361
00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:47.060
I want that on my
website. I did not expect

362
00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:50.180
that. You know, I'm you
look like using stereotypes again,

363
00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:51.890
as an example, you know,
like, Oh, here's a list

364
00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:55.100
of a column of, you
know, four different tropes and

365
00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:56.540
then you hover over one
of them and then the

366
00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:58.460
whole page comes alive and
you're like, Oh, wait a

367
00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:02.810
second. And then the neurons
in your brain start making

368
00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:06.950
connections that are directly associated
with like, you've inspired those

369
00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:10.340
neurons to suddenly start firing.
And then you'll just spend

370
00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:12.350
your whole day on the
website. It's really pretty cool.

371
00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:16.430
That's that's the, the chief
complaint people have had for

372
00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:18.740
us is that we've made
it too easy to spend

373
00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:21.470
a lot of time there.
And we had someone who

374
00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:23.900
was on site for six
hours and we just couldn't

375
00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:25.880
believe it. And we kind
of wondered if they were

376
00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:28.520
just like left it open,
but they were just periodic

377
00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:31.460
activity. And like, that is
my favorite user, whoever you

378
00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:35.540
are out there, like, I
love you. Thank you. There

379
00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:38.120
was a knee. I would
hate to have someone lose

380
00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:42.470
their job because your visualization
was too effective. That's a

381
00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:45.080
great problem. So how do
you build something like that

382
00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:49.360
is this <inaudible> dot JS.
Yeah. So we're using D

383
00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:53.290
three for, for all the
different visualizations and there's some

384
00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:57.970
other more MVC specific components.
So we're using backbone in

385
00:20:57.970 --> 00:21:02.260
this case, but we've used
various kinds of libraries to,

386
00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:04.810
to fill in those gaps.
And then the entire site

387
00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:09.250
is actually just a static
site. So neat, especially for

388
00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:14.200
apps that don't recall. It's
a static site feels so

389
00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:18.610
dynamic. It is very dynamic
when I say static, I

390
00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:22.150
mean that there isn't a
backend server. That's actually powering

391
00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:24.370
any type of queries. What
we end up doing in

392
00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:26.380
these cases where we know
the data is finite. We

393
00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:28.780
know the queries that we're
going to make. We actually

394
00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:31.600
pre generate all the decent
data, dump it on us

395
00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:35.440
three and the front end
app just makes requests to

396
00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:38.200
that, which is pretty great
because you literally couldn't bring

397
00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:41.800
it down unless Amazon goes
down and then you know,

398
00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:44.310
that the rest of the
internet is out. So That's

399
00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:47.220
so amazing. I love that
we have come full circle

400
00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:51.750
and that a site that
feels dynamic that is dynamic

401
00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:56.490
is at the height of
technology here in 2015, happens

402
00:21:56.490 --> 00:21:59.700
to be statically generated because
the dataset is finite. Of

403
00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:03.060
course, it's the totally appropriate
thing to do for this

404
00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:07.800
technology need. Yeah, absolutely. For
things that are read only

405
00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:10.470
in this way, we would
definitely consider it a lot

406
00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:12.990
of times. And in this
case we sort of, we

407
00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:15.180
have kind of a data
pipeline that actually goes and

408
00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:19.060
gets the data and that's
a whole nother craziness. The,

409
00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:22.890
the data is like many
gigabytes and it's a triple

410
00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:26.220
form. And so there's a
whole analysis pipeline that we

411
00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:29.070
can just rerun and then
it'll regenerate all our files

412
00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:33.330
and update them. So, yeah,
it works really great. Talking

413
00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:36.420
a little bit about D
three JS, was that another

414
00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:42.060
kind of pivot point in
the creation of effective visualizations?

415
00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:44.310
I mean, there were things
beforehand, there was a lot

416
00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:47.700
of Java for a time
only, only Java was the

417
00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:50.160
visualization tool, like in the
early two thousands. If you

418
00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:52.260
wanted to see a visualization,
you'd show up at a

419
00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:56.040
page, the page would pause,
Java would load and there'd

420
00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:59.070
be a little Island of
interactivity, but then it seems

421
00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:03.270
like D three JS changed
all that. Yeah, absolutely. I

422
00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:07.650
would say that <inaudible> really
ushered a new era for

423
00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:11.100
people making, not just charting
on the web, but really

424
00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:13.530
creative charting on the web.
There were sort of like

425
00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:17.340
predecessors. So DQE came out
of the work of my

426
00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:20.250
cross doc. Obviously everyone should
follow. Cause he just does

427
00:23:20.250 --> 00:23:23.130
amazing things all the time.
And before that there were

428
00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:28.230
some other libraries. One of
is, and actually its predecessor.

429
00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:30.840
It was a library called
flare, which was written, I

430
00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:36.720
believe in a flash or
Java, but they started to

431
00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:39.630
implement this idea of coming
out of what's called a

432
00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:43.140
graphic, the grammar of graphics,
where you sort of really

433
00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:46.640
break down our visualization into
the components that it contains.

434
00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:50.600
So you identify them as
repeatable patterns. So for example,

435
00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.990
and a scatterplot circle is
a, is a Mark and

436
00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:55.820
you can have lots of
different types of marks and

437
00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:57.680
you can have different layers
of marks and then you

438
00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:01.700
have axes. And, and so
instead of saying, I want

439
00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:04.850
a bar chart, all those,
all those different libraries work

440
00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:07.730
by saying, well, I need
to have some axes. And

441
00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:09.860
then I also need to
have bars and those bars

442
00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:12.290
are gonna repeat according to
this rule and they're going

443
00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:16.190
to be high up or
other role. And so the

444
00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:19.040
power of D three is
actually in that it is

445
00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:21.830
very flexible. So it does
have some prebuilt and layouts

446
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:25.460
for, for things like, you
know, area graphs, for example,

447
00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:28.970
where you can pass the
data and it will basically

448
00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:32.420
attach positioning specific properties to
it. But in a lot

449
00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:34.700
of cases, you really can
be very flexible with it.

450
00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:38.060
So if you decided you
wanted to have your visualization

451
00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:40.940
be, you know, stars that
you positioned in space, according

452
00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:44.870
to my multiplying, some data
points and translating them to,

453
00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:48.740
you know, your, your SPG
elements. Sure. You can totally

454
00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:52.550
do that because that, that's
kind of the main part

455
00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:56.450
of decrease that it's data-driven
documents. So you just have

456
00:24:56.450 --> 00:24:59.690
that binding really closely together.
And then as a result,

457
00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:03.260
you can kind of create
new types of visualization. And

458
00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:07.700
I think both decrease existence
and being so flexible combined

459
00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:10.700
with all the amazing work
that the New York times were

460
00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:12.920
doing with it. So Mike
Bostok was working at the

461
00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:15.590
new times for a long
time and producing really incredible,

462
00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:20.840
incredible interactive and releasing just
hundreds, if not thousands of

463
00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:25.070
examples. So a lot of
the DC community is powered

464
00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:28.730
by this website called blocks
and blocks are just really

465
00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:32.780
shareable pieces of D three
code that that rendered is

466
00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:35.030
just, it's just a just
viewer. If you love just

467
00:25:35.030 --> 00:25:39.170
our get hub, a small
get out code snippets. And,

468
00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:42.430
but what made them great
is that lots of people

469
00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:45.260
are producing that basically covering
a ton of different examples

470
00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:47.720
for the kind of visualizations
you'd want. So if you

471
00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:51.380
needed an example of some
crazy diagram, it's pretty likely

472
00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:53.360
that you could find it
and then just modify it

473
00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:57.800
to fit your code. And
Mike bossa created hundreds of

474
00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:00.920
them so that other people
and tools were built are

475
00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:03.380
being built on top of
that to make it even

476
00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:05.900
easier for people to find
the examples that they need.

477
00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:08.690
And so, as a result,
there's just a huge ecosystem

478
00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:12.340
around it. So blocks is
kind of like code pen

479
00:26:12.370 --> 00:26:17.320
or GS for visualizations, and
you can share them and

480
00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:21.460
remix them and there's even
a browser extension. So this

481
00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:23.440
is the place that people
who are listening, like they

482
00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:26.080
should probably start at blocks
and start learning about how

483
00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:29.650
this stuff works. Yeah, absolutely.
I would say you can

484
00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:32.920
go to Mike <inaudible> page
on the blocks website and

485
00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:36.640
just look through the examples
and be super impressed and

486
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.120
intimidated. And then, and then
just look at the code

487
00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:42.250
and say, Oh, I can
do this and then do

488
00:26:42.690 --> 00:26:45.810
it. It's one of the
things That is most impressive

489
00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:49.110
about D three is the,
the element of time. It's

490
00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:52.410
not just doing data binding
and presenting a visualization, but

491
00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:55.500
the idea that if the
data changes, the visualization changes

492
00:26:55.560 --> 00:27:01.220
dynamically. Yeah, absolutely. So one
of the most exciting, but

493
00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:04.580
also most challenging parts of
decree is understanding this life

494
00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:09.260
cycle set up, basically any
kind of element can be

495
00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:11.930
in three different States. It
could either be entering as

496
00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:15.870
in it wasn't, it didn't
exist before in the dataset

497
00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:18.320
and now it appeared it
could be exiting as in

498
00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:21.230
it is no longer going
to be present and then

499
00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:24.410
updated, which is, you know,
it's been there and it

500
00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:27.410
may have changed our main
thought of, and the way

501
00:27:27.410 --> 00:27:29.600
that you work with day
three is basically you just,

502
00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:32.720
you just specify the instructions
for what should happen to

503
00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:36.560
those elements at those three
different stages. And it's actually

504
00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:39.470
pretty cool because that means
that no matter how many

505
00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:41.750
times we data comes through,
you kind of have the

506
00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:44.450
set of instructions for what
should happen at those points

507
00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:47.390
in time. So it takes
a little while to kind

508
00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:50.660
of wrap your head around
it, especially because one of

509
00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:52.490
the funky things about D
three is that even though

510
00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:55.120
you're working with a collection
of elements like an actual

511
00:27:55.130 --> 00:27:57.680
Ray or something, it doesn't
seem that way because you

512
00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:00.530
just change things, change things
along, and it looks like

513
00:28:00.530 --> 00:28:03.260
you're working on a single
element, but you're not, but

514
00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:04.790
once you sort of wrap
your head around it, it

515
00:28:04.790 --> 00:28:08.240
becomes really easy to be
able to add kind of

516
00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:12.980
that interactivity. And initially that
interactivity, obviously it's just, you

517
00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:16.700
know, you add things, remove
things it's still somewhat static,

518
00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:19.340
but you can very quickly
add transitions to that. And

519
00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:22.250
transitions actually let you animate
from one point to another.

520
00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:24.740
So once you know that
you want to point, for

521
00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:27.560
example, to appear when it's
entering, instead of it just

522
00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:31.520
showing up, you can, let's
say animated capacity. And that

523
00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:33.710
is literally just a couple
more lines of code. So

524
00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:36.800
we started seeing a lot
of really exciting animation being

525
00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:39.410
added because once you kind
of get the basics, you

526
00:28:39.410 --> 00:28:42.650
can just layer them. In
addition to that, you have,

527
00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:46.760
Would it be fair to
compare D three JS with

528
00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:49.700
jQuery in the, in the
sense of it was a,

529
00:28:50.130 --> 00:28:54.860
a quantum leap on top
of JavaScript and also provided

530
00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:59.000
this idea of chained kind
of fluent interfaces? Yeah, I

531
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.030
absolutely think so. And actually
when I teach R D

532
00:29:02.030 --> 00:29:04.940
three class, I actually start
by comparing the two different

533
00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:07.850
libraries because they do actually
share some functionality. So you're

534
00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:11.510
still interfacing with the Dom.
You can still set properties,

535
00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:15.410
you can style elements and
things like that. And then

536
00:29:15.410 --> 00:29:17.690
they kind of divergent their
own directions. And that D

537
00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:21.290
three then adds all this
extra functionality for working with

538
00:29:21.290 --> 00:29:23.960
visualization. And I think in
terms of its significance, it

539
00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:27.650
absolutely had the same type
of effects on our community

540
00:29:27.650 --> 00:29:30.890
where, whereas before it was
something that a select few

541
00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:33.560
folks did and it was
really hard to do. So

542
00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:38.390
you didn't see nearly as
many really exciting, really engaging

543
00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:41.410
visualizations. It just didn't have
as broad a reach. And

544
00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:44.170
now it's kind of the
de facto standard. You sort

545
00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:46.900
of start from there and
then, you know, you might

546
00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:49.840
decide, okay, I need to
work with lip geo or

547
00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:52.210
is that too much data?
Or maybe I want to

548
00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:54.790
work with canvas, but that,
that is just the starting

549
00:29:54.790 --> 00:29:56.450
point for a lot of
people. Now just like Jake

550
00:29:56.450 --> 00:30:00.690
greens. Do you feel that
a good visualization technology is

551
00:30:00.690 --> 00:30:03.030
one that lets you focus
on the visualization and less

552
00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:06.570
on the technology? Or is
that, or are they impossible

553
00:30:06.570 --> 00:30:11.520
to decouple the two? I
think it probably depends on

554
00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:15.780
the use case that folks
are running into. I think

555
00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:19.020
that it is good to
have as close the pairing

556
00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:21.690
between the technology and what
it is you're trying to

557
00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:24.240
do. So I think in
terms of what D three

558
00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:26.880
offers you, once you get
used to it, which mind

559
00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:29.160
you takes a really long
time, I do want to

560
00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:32.070
give folks that warning. It's
just, it's a hard library

561
00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:34.410
to be months. It took
everybody. I know, months don't

562
00:30:34.410 --> 00:30:38.280
give up on it, but
once you kind of wrap

563
00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:40.650
your head around it, there
is very much a one

564
00:30:40.650 --> 00:30:42.960
to one mapping between what
you want to do and

565
00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:44.580
the code that you need
to write to do it.

566
00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:48.600
I would say there isn't
too much obstruction layers there.

567
00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:51.240
Isn't some kind of a
crazy magical structure. There's no

568
00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:55.170
magic can decrease just about.
It's very functional. You pass

569
00:30:55.170 --> 00:30:58.290
data in it. Things happen
to it. You create elements,

570
00:30:58.290 --> 00:31:03.210
we customize them Functional. That's,
that's almost like a bit

571
00:31:03.210 --> 00:31:05.130
of double entendre. There is
a kind of a functional

572
00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:07.170
language of its own. You
are thinking about math and

573
00:31:07.170 --> 00:31:10.440
about chaining functions together. Yeah.
I mean, you're changing functions

574
00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:12.840
together, but one of the
funny things in decree is

575
00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:16.470
that sometimes what you produce
is actually more functions that

576
00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:19.230
you can pass data through.
So an example of that

577
00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:22.860
would be using D three
skills, which are really custom,

578
00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:26.520
really useful utility for translating
data from one space to

579
00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:29.430
another. So the most common
use is actually a translating

580
00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:33.030
your data from your business
domain to actual pixels in

581
00:31:33.030 --> 00:31:36.000
space. And you can customize
these skills. You can say,

582
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.980
okay, this is going to
be a linear scale. And

583
00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:41.130
this is the domain range,
and this is the actual

584
00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:45.540
visual range pixel range. And
I wanted to be done

585
00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:48.420
in these increments, things like
that. And all that gives

586
00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:50.970
you is another function that
you can then actually just

587
00:31:50.970 --> 00:31:53.280
Piper data points through in
a low how to translate

588
00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:56.160
them. And that's another kind
of confusing part about D

589
00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:58.260
three, is that a lot
of the times you're just

590
00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:01.650
customizing these extra functions that
are then going to be

591
00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:05.670
super tailored to what you're
trying to do. So you

592
00:32:05.670 --> 00:32:08.940
are also the chair of
a conference called open visit,

593
00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:13.170
is that correct? Yes, that
is correct. So open vis

594
00:32:13.170 --> 00:32:18.000
a vis@openvisitcovid.com is coming up
in April. So the two

595
00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.390
day conference is single track
and it's dedicated to the

596
00:32:21.390 --> 00:32:24.690
practice of visualizing data on
the web. Is this something

597
00:32:24.690 --> 00:32:28.350
you think people who are
listening should come to? Absolutely.

598
00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:31.320
I'm really, really proud of
open this conference going to

599
00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:34.980
be our fourth year and
every year we bring together

600
00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:38.430
folks who are actual practitioners
in this field. And we

601
00:32:38.430 --> 00:32:41.960
say, please, our attendees learn
how to do what you

602
00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:45.830
do. So we're very much
focused on having an educational

603
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:50.270
spirit. It's not quite tutorials,
but just about some folks

604
00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:52.400
will go out there and
they'll talk about libraries that

605
00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:55.400
they use, or they'll dissect
the project they've built, or

606
00:32:55.400 --> 00:33:00.490
they'll talk about design patterns.
And it's really just an

607
00:33:00.490 --> 00:33:02.900
incredible set of folks. Every
year we run the call

608
00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:05.270
for speakers. We're actually right
in the middle of our

609
00:33:05.270 --> 00:33:08.600
current reviews for next year.
And we're just so impressed

610
00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:10.280
with everything that comes in.
I always want to make

611
00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:13.160
it like a month of
talks because they're all great,

612
00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:16.700
but we do. We generally
cover kind of the full

613
00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:21.080
space from a data analysis
to data visualization, to, you

614
00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:24.170
know, working with the newest
and most exciting technologies in

615
00:33:24.170 --> 00:33:27.290
the web, but also how
to bring in this work

616
00:33:27.530 --> 00:33:30.830
to your practice and into
your life. So it's the

617
00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:32.920
goal is for it to
be very, very accessible. Very

618
00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:35.230
cool. It looks like it's
accessible also from a pricing

619
00:33:35.230 --> 00:33:37.450
perspective, it looks like a
great conference. I think that

620
00:33:37.450 --> 00:33:40.300
anybody who is interested in
the space should definitely check

621
00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:45.040
it out@openvisitcovid.com. Thanks so much
for chatting with me today,

622
00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:47.980
Irene. I really appreciate. Thank
you so much, Scott. It's

623
00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:50.590
been really great. I'm really
honored to be on your

624
00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:53.950
show. This has been another
episode of Hanselminutes and we'll

625
00:33:53.950 --> 00:33:55.150
see you again next week.
