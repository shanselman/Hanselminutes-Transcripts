this episode has got talks
with Dave boils who worked

9
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.270
on the Comcast Xfinity application
for Xbox. Hi, this is

10
00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.310
Scott Hanselman. This is another
episode of Hansel minutes, and

11
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.680
I'm talking with Dave Voyles.
He used to work at

12
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.220
Comcast on the Xbox apps,
and now works. In fact

13
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.800
for Microsoft, you worked for
Microsoft on the East coast.

14
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.760
Is that right? Correct. I'm
located in Philadelphia. It's probably

15
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.850
pretty snowy there, I assume.
Yeah. Yeah. We've been quite

16
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.070
the Tundra, the whole Northeast
the last couple of weeks.

17
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.300
Yeah. It's snowpocalypse here in
Oregon. Everyone is homesick. And

18
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.610
if w w w if
it wasn't snowing, we'd be

19
00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.700
homesick. We're completely snowed in
and there's really no way

20
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.680
to get anywhere. So I
think there's an, there's an

21
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.560
inch of snow. It sounds
just like my household. Yeah.

22
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.400
An interest. No is crippled
Portland. So, so we're playing

23
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.720
on the Xbox today. I
got an X-Box one. I

24
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.400
do have an Xbox three
60, but I bought an

25
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.340
Xbox one. I bit the
bullet on this thing, and

26
00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.150
now I have a direct
TV and you worked for

27
00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.360
Comcast. And I also see
other kinds of discussion around

28
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.960
TV apps and stuff like
that. What's the default experience

29
00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.820
that a person who wants
to watch TV get on

30
00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.950
an Xbox, just plugging the
HDI and you tell it,

31
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.180
you know, HTMI pass through
from whoever, whichever cable box

32
00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.780
you're currently using into your
Xbox one. And then from

33
00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.540
there you're X-Box can detect
which device are you using.

34
00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.060
And it can then display
a guide based on the

35
00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.910
content available in your area.
Yeah. And I've had a

36
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.710
little bit, it's kind of
a weird experience if you're

37
00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.960
used to using your DVR,
because you basically have to

38
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.020
decide which guide you want.
Yes. Correct. It'll look differently

39
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.680
from your native guide. Right.
So if I hit, if

40
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.320
I had guide on my
DirecTV, I get this DirecTV

41
00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.060
menu. And if I hit
guide on the Xbox, I

42
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.410
get an Xbox menu, but
you helped work on the

43
00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.290
Comcast app. Now, would that
be an app that would

44
00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.840
make my Xbox at DVR?
Or what does that app,

45
00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:46.250
like? What does it, what
does an app from a

46
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.290
TV provider provide to the
Xbox? Well, the largest feature

47
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.390
We're adding for that app
is very similar to the

48
00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.730
Xbox three 60 app that
we had as well, titled

49
00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.500
Xfinity. And that basically gives
you access to the on

50
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.740
demand catalog. So you'd log
in one time with your

51
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.250
gamer tag, which is then
linked to your Comcast account

52
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.610
and sure that other platforms
handle this very similarly. And

53
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.040
then from there, we're just
passing a token back and

54
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.630
forth between your device and
Comcast that says I'm David

55
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.200
Voiles and I have access
to HBO stars or whatever

56
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.110
networks you prefer. And this
way it opens up that

57
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.510
content to you. So if
you want to watch a

58
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.360
movie or television show that
was on previously, you have

59
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.930
access to all of them.
So it's like, it's like

60
00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.750
Netflix or Amazon or any
of the on demand systems,

61
00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.380
but it's specific to that
company. So it's the Comcast

62
00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.880
on demand experience. Yes, Exactly.
So I don't think any

63
00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.400
of these apps cost any
additional money. It's really just

64
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.460
more added value onto what
you already have for your

65
00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.370
cable program. Hmm. So then
if you had like a

66
00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.040
set top box, you may
or may not have on

67
00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.040
demand on demand experiences. This
could augment it, like by

68
00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.990
having an Xbox, you'd be
like, Oh, look, I have

69
00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:00.420
Comcast. I have on demand.
Suddenly I have more than

70
00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.060
I have. That's right. Yeah.
So there, there really two

71
00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.730
benefits to having it. The
first is the movies or

72
00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.880
titles that are gonna be
available to you because content

73
00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.300
providers look at cable boxes
as one form of media.

74
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.930
And they look at digital
devices such as your X-Box

75
00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.450
as a different form of
content. So some movies may

76
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.880
only be available on one
or the other. So that's

77
00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.030
one large reason why we
do that. Yeah. It's been

78
00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.690
an interesting to watch the
Xbox and boxes like it

79
00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.650
try to take over the
living room because I think

80
00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.120
we, the consumer expects that
one day a, a Comcast

81
00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.130
or a DirecTV is going
to show up and no

82
00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.680
longer have a cable box.
Like they would no longer

83
00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.040
be a Comcast box or
even Motorola of generic silver

84
00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.200
box. They would just hand
me an Xbox and say,

85
00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.830
here you go, this is
now your cable box. Yeah.

86
00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.810
Yeah. It's funny because you
think that they would be

87
00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.330
competitors in the same market
and that, you know, Xbox

88
00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.150
has its own movie and
video streaming service. And so

89
00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.730
does Comcast. So it's a,
it's funny, you see them

90
00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:01.560
kind of go back and
forth, but I think we're

91
00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.610
very far from having a
cable box less future. Yeah.

92
00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.230
There's always going to be
some kind of box I'm

93
00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:11.130
afraid now. I assume you
have an Xbox one. Yes,

94
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.460
I do. Yeah. Do you
have Comcast? Yes, I do.

95
00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.240
Okay. So when one of
the things that I think

96
00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.770
is the most amazing about
the Xbox one that I've

97
00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.890
been really impressed with is
this idea of HTMI pass

98
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.910
through. Like, I remember early
attempts at HTMI pass through

99
00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.940
just being kind of lame.
And what they would do

100
00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.060
is they would like put
a big pink square up

101
00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.950
on the screen, and then
they would detect where the

102
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:39.300
pink square was. And then
they would overlay the, not

103
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.950
the Xbox, but this is
like people who did this,

104
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:42.600
like the hodgepodge card and
things like that. They were

105
00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.190
to overlay the content over
that. And then if you

106
00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.230
move the window fast enough,
you could see the pink,

107
00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.980
Really what that was is
the, the handshake that goes

108
00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:51.870
back and forth between devices
to make sure that you

109
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.050
have DRM going between the
two of them. So it's

110
00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.370
largely the content providers that
require that. Yeah. But On

111
00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:02.690
the Xbox one, it is
absolutely seamless, seamless. It's perfect.

112
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.210
And it's getting to the
point now where the frame

113
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.170
rate on the on demand
stuff, like the stuff that

114
00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.190
you see from Comcast is
so high. It's so good

115
00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:12.590
quality that you really can't
tell whether you're watching on

116
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.810
demand or whether you're watching
live HTMI. Yeah, exactly. So,

117
00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.750
I mean, even in my
home, we have our Comcast

118
00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:23.380
cable box plugged directly into
Xbox and largely that's because

119
00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:24.910
we had one button on
the Xbox and it turns

120
00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:28.630
on my receiver, my television
and my cable box. Right.

121
00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:31.330
Which is really weird for
people to like see for

122
00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:34.930
the first time, because it's
sending IRR. I'm just, again,

123
00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:36.700
I don't know anything more
than anyone else. So even

124
00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.280
though I worked for Microsoft
for the listeners, I work

125
00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.250
in the Azure to group.
So I literally only know

126
00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:45.310
about what I learn on
like the verge, when I,

127
00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:48.610
so from an Xbox perspective,
I have no inside information

128
00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:51.220
of any kind. I know
what I can see by

129
00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:53.920
observing it. So I plugged
it in and it comes

130
00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.170
with the connect and the
connect sits right there. And

131
00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.920
I noticed that the connect
is, is sending out IRR.

132
00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:01.840
Like the connect is not
just sending out IRR to

133
00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.630
detect whether or not I'm
there. Yes. But it's sending

134
00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:08.380
out the CO's and it's
the IRR blaster, I think.

135
00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:10.210
But I really haven't like
nothing to back this up.

136
00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.190
I think that the game
pad may do the same

137
00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:14.740
as well. And the only
reason I have that hunch

138
00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:18.010
is because my connects is
above my television and all

139
00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:20.380
of my immediate devices are
beneath my TV and a

140
00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:22.810
small closet or not in
the closet. They're not exposed

141
00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:24.880
to the Xbox, we'll say.
So when I do sit

142
00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.230
in front of the TV,
I have my remote in

143
00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:28.420
hand, my game pad, and
it's pointing back to my

144
00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:31.600
devices. So I'm thinking, but
I really have nothing to

145
00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.630
back this up that it
also shoots out IRR. I,

146
00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:36.940
I know that it has,
I are on it. And

147
00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:38.650
I know that it has
to in there kind of

148
00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:40.510
offset and you can see
them. And one of the

149
00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:41.860
things that you can do
is if you have an

150
00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:46.060
old style video recorder, like
a, like a super eight

151
00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:49.270
or any kind of VHS
point the camera at the

152
00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:52.300
IRR emitter, and you will
actually be able to see

153
00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:55.150
the infrared light, this is
how you can detect that

154
00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:57.490
kind of stuff. So the
question is that you and

155
00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:01.000
I are kind of proposing,
is that, is it blasting

156
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.310
out the IRR code to
like turn on the TV

157
00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:08.140
or change channels from both
the connect and the, and

158
00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:12.070
the remote controller, or is
the controller I are used

159
00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:13.780
for something else. I know
that they use the controller.

160
00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:17.140
I are to pair the
two. So in the old

161
00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:18.430
days you had to like
push a button here and

162
00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:19.810
push a button there, and
then it would go and

163
00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:21.940
like RF and go weren't
weren't right. And then try

164
00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:25.300
to like detect. Now it
can, it can see it

165
00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.750
as this IRR, They're able
to do this. So seamlessly

166
00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:31.210
kind of blew me away
as well, because I'd previously

167
00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:34.240
worked in the audio visual
industry in Manhattan and launch

168
00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:36.820
tech had a number of
great devices, but there's a

169
00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:39.040
lot of programming work on
the backend for someone to

170
00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:41.350
figure out how all of
these devices are paired together

171
00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:43.480
and the unique codes for
each one of them. Yeah.

172
00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:45.610
It was really seamless. You
turn it on and you

173
00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:48.160
say, I have a Samsung.
And then it says to

174
00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:50.530
the TV, just turn off.
And you're like, yeah. And

175
00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:52.180
like, all right, we know
which one it is really

176
00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:54.070
in the old days, you
had to get a book

177
00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:56.220
and you had to like
type in a code at

178
00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:59.220
the back. It was a
whole thing. So yeah, it,

179
00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:03.000
it turns on my TV,
the Xbox, the onco, like

180
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.380
all the different diverse devices,
it turns them on. And

181
00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.500
it actually, it's an instant
on mode. So I just

182
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:11.850
say Xbox on. And then
it turns everything on automatically,

183
00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:13.770
which is great. So I
just walk in and say,

184
00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:17.610
Xbox on the, and then
I hooked up my Logitech

185
00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:20.390
harmony remote control. Okay. Yeah.
I still use one of

186
00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:23.300
those as well. Fantastic. And
I taught it all about

187
00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:26.810
the Xbox. That has actually
been the only if there's

188
00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:29.690
one bad thing, the only
difficult thing is the, the

189
00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:33.140
wife doesn't know when the
up, down arrows control the

190
00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:36.800
DirecTV or when they control
the, The Xbox. Yeah. We

191
00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.570
have the same issue in
my house, too. Good of

192
00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:40.340
a learning curve on that
end. But that's a bit

193
00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:42.680
of a first world problem,
right? I mean, that's just

194
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:44.690
the, the situation you have
when you have so many

195
00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:48.920
electronic devices in one room.
Now, from what I read

196
00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:52.140
online, you know, the Xbox
is running some flavor of,

197
00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:55.460
of windows. It clearly looks
and feels like windows. And

198
00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:57.620
if you've got a windows
phone or windows eight machine,

199
00:09:57.650 --> 00:10:02.300
the dashboard feels very comfortable.
And I know on windows,

200
00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:06.680
I can write applications in
HTML and JavaScript. Can I

201
00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:09.110
do the same thing? And
I write a JavaScript, HTML,

202
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:12.230
HTML, five application on an
Xbox. Yes. So in a

203
00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:15.410
September, Microsoft had revealed that
you can use HTML five

204
00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:18.770
for apps. I haven't heard
any word about games, but

205
00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:22.520
apps for your Xbox one.
So specifically, that's what we

206
00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:26.690
used for, for Xfinity app,
a Comcast it's really, It

207
00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:29.150
would be smooth. Like I
know that people, when they

208
00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:32.060
think of an HTML five
app, they think of, Oh,

209
00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:34.190
well, they're just going to
put internet Explorer, full screen.

210
00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:37.430
And then, Yeah. And that's
not the case, not the

211
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:39.890
same. It's not the same
as it. No, no, not

212
00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:41.720
at all. I mean, when
I was writing work there,

213
00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:45.440
it had nothing to do
with internet Explorer. You're essentially

214
00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.480
what Microsoft is doing is
exposing, this is the same

215
00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:50.720
on windows eight. They're exposing
many, if not all of

216
00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:54.170
the windows, eight API, just
via JavaScript. And this is

217
00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:57.200
making the transition easier for
web developers to then come

218
00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:01.280
over instead of having to
write native code everywhere. When

219
00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:04.280
you were writing, when you're
writing the, the Comcast app,

220
00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:07.700
I assume you're bringing in
libraries that are, X-Box one

221
00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:10.850
specific JavaScript libraries. And then
that's how you, you, you

222
00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:12.800
will then call them. Or
are you saying document dot

223
00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:16.520
something and then accessing the
Xbox? Yes, yes, exactly. So

224
00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:20.390
everything that's available through whatever
native libraries, whether it's C

225
00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:22.850
plus plus or C sharp,
you may use on windows

226
00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:26.630
eight, those same things are
API are available to JavaScript

227
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:29.240
developers. So how does that
work? You're looking at the

228
00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:32.300
Xbox one documentation that you've
got available to you as

229
00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:35.060
a textbox box one developer,
and you see some API

230
00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:36.890
and maybe you find some
sample code in C plus

231
00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:39.530
plus. Yes. Do you say,
Oh, I can use, I

232
00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:41.990
can call that. Yeah, you
can just call anything. They

233
00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:46.220
essentially have an equivalent. They
have, basically, if you're writing

234
00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:50.030
on a windows eight, you'd
have, when dot, JS, and

235
00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:51.920
Xbox has the same version.
I don't want to go

236
00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.460
into any details about that,
but yeah, whatever you have

237
00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:56.830
for JavaScript developer on windows
eight, you have on Xbox

238
00:11:56.830 --> 00:12:00.660
one. So conceptually the layering
idea of, of wind JS

239
00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.690
as a way to expose
native APIs to JavaScript or

240
00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:06.270
are there Yep. So that's
why I suggest for anyone

241
00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:08.820
who has even a hunch
for wanting to make something

242
00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:11.490
for Xbox one, right. For
windows eight, that is the

243
00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:14.640
best place to get started
without a doubt. Seriously. Yeah,

244
00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:17.580
absolutely. You have, if you
are thinking that when, when

245
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:20.010
I'm not sure what the
status of Xbox one apps,

246
00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:22.110
like, if any, if an
indie apps can be made,

247
00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:25.230
I dunno. I dunno. I
will. I assume that some

248
00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:27.450
will hear about that, that
some coming up soon. But

249
00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:30.240
my question is, you're saying
if I want to write

250
00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:32.520
an app for Xbox one,
I don't have to wait.

251
00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:35.340
I can write a wind
JS app on windows eight

252
00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:38.700
as kind of practice and
be able to use much

253
00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:43.410
of that code on the
Xbox. Absolutely. Absolutely. That same

254
00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:46.510
goes for games too. So
when you wrote the, the,

255
00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:49.680
the Comcast app where you
guys laying this out in

256
00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:53.930
CSS and HTML and, and
yeah, so basically like the

257
00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:56.550
layout of the structure of
the windows. Yes. Everything was

258
00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:59.880
done in HTML for the
markup CSS or the styling

259
00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:03.330
and JavaScript for animations and
a lot of the backend

260
00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:06.360
work. So again, before I
had a dev kit, I

261
00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:08.430
did all of this and
windows eight, got an idea

262
00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:10.740
for what I'd be looking
for. They even provided us

263
00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:13.500
with a windows eight version
to get up and running.

264
00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:16.830
And if you can read
HTML and, you know, JavaScript

265
00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:20.310
and anything about windows eight,
it's seamless to go over

266
00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:22.950
from one project to the
other. How, how different were

267
00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:24.900
they? I mean, is it
just straight when JS, or

268
00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:27.240
did you have to like
abstract away some Xbox, one

269
00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:30.690
specific things? Like, for example,
the controller for navigation and

270
00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:33.840
things like that. Oh, I
mean, Microsoft handled all that

271
00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:35.250
for us. I didn't have
to do any of the

272
00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:39.390
controller work, especially on windows
eight, but I can't get

273
00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:41.910
into too many details. But
what I can say is

274
00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:46.200
that my going from doing
the Xbox three 60 work

275
00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:50.100
to then going to X-Box
one, it was far, far

276
00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:53.460
easier. The products were much
more organized. And as a

277
00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:56.850
web developer, it was very
well documented and very, very

278
00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:59.580
easy to make that transition.
Cool. Yeah. I was trying

279
00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:01.170
to get a sense of,
like, I know when you

280
00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:04.200
are looking at tiles or
lists of tiles on, on

281
00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:07.050
windows, you can select them
with the mouse. You can

282
00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:09.810
touch them or you can
move around with a keyboard.

283
00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:14.100
So I'm presuming that it's
similar to a move around

284
00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:17.110
with the D pad on
the, on the controller, on

285
00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:20.100
an X. So the idea
of like selection and the

286
00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:22.950
selection rectangle, it's just handled
for you on the Xbox.

287
00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:25.200
That's correct. Okay. So you
don't have to worry about

288
00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.330
like, Oh, do this with
the controller that is all

289
00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:29.730
abstracted a built in piece
of input. Yep. So I

290
00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:33.780
was basically writing a as
simple of an app as

291
00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:37.440
I possibly could because fortunately
the Xbox libraries handle all

292
00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:41.010
that difficult work. Yeah. Like
the, like the backend things,

293
00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:43.740
the connect, the game pad,
they handle all of that.

294
00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:45.990
So it made my job
extremely easy. It's not like

295
00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:47.880
it's not low level. It's
not like for a little

296
00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:50.160
bit, you're going in grabbing
input. It's just, you're writing

297
00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.100
click handlers effectively. And that's
all you need to worry

298
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:55.030
about. Would hook up click
handlers. I would grab a

299
00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:57.460
Jason object from our backend.
And it may be something

300
00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:59.860
as simple as a list
of movies. Maybe it's a

301
00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:02.890
hundred children's titles. I loop
through them as an array

302
00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:04.960
and I can pull out
whatever information I want, whether

303
00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:07.930
it's a picture, a list
of a cast or a

304
00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:11.260
description. And when, if, if,
if you want to make

305
00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.660
it so you can select
the items with connect. Yes.

306
00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:15.760
Is that built in as
well? That's just another selection

307
00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:21.010
API. In fact, they have
the connect to, I was

308
00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:22.660
skeptical at first, but when
I finally used it for

309
00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:26.650
myself, all my fears were
squashed because of how well

310
00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:28.330
it works and how precise
it was. So we spent

311
00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:30.430
quite a bit of time
playing with it and getting

312
00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:32.650
used to it. And it
is available if you'd like

313
00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:36.520
to add more features yourself.
But again, Microsoft handles all

314
00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:38.020
that for us. So if
I didn't want to touch

315
00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:41.200
it at all, it's not.
Yeah. It's definitely a, I

316
00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:43.600
would recommend to people who
do have an Xbox one

317
00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:47.140
to go through the gesture,
tutorial, you know, whatever tutorials

318
00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:48.970
the system gives you, what
it prompts you for. Like,

319
00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:51.310
Hey, you want to learn
about this? Cause the connect

320
00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:53.560
is different. Like an Xbox
three 60, you hold your

321
00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:57.010
hand there and you wait
for it to spin. And

322
00:15:57.010 --> 00:15:59.560
on the Xbox one, you
kind of like push in

323
00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:03.820
intuitive and natural emotion guide
is, and then you can

324
00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:07.750
scroll by kind of moving
forward, grabbing and then moving

325
00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:09.850
over and then opening. So
it seems to see your

326
00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:12.490
fingers more than, than the
other connections. Yeah. We were

327
00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:15.910
all very surprised and it
worked very, very well. And

328
00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:18.040
again, we don't have to
make any changes to it,

329
00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:20.200
but if you're gonna really
make something that's going to

330
00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:23.320
be innovative or stand out
for users and make their

331
00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:26.650
experience better, you really are
encouraged to do that. And

332
00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:28.150
they make it easier this
time around. Would that be

333
00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:29.800
like a pinch to zoom
or a move? You know,

334
00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:31.840
what kind of gestures might
you think you would want

335
00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:34.060
to add to, to make
your app stand out? Even

336
00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:35.800
if it's not something like
gestures, it may be something

337
00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:39.640
like auditory cues that you
may might call out. I

338
00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:42.370
forgot about that. Yeah. So
you can make Collie a

339
00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:45.010
buy S for movie by
title or by a cast

340
00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:47.800
member. So all of that
is, is open to you.

341
00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:50.740
And again, like the, the
tools have improved exponentially over

342
00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:53.260
what we're using. Did you
do that? Did you add

343
00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.540
voice support too? I didn't,
I didn't have any time

344
00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:59.470
at that moment before, right?
No. Okay. That's cool. Now

345
00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:00.940
was the app done when
you left? Are they, are

346
00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:03.310
they still working on it?
They sold a little bit

347
00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:04.890
to go, but I mean,
to give you an idea

348
00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:08.620
of how simple this process
was, I was the only

349
00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:10.660
person working on this. So
it wasn't like we had

350
00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:13.210
a team of people. I
mean, I think Comcast is

351
00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:17.140
90,000 employees, but I was
the only person working on

352
00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:19.630
it. So that, that gives
you an idea of how

353
00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:21.400
simple it is to get
a project like that up

354
00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:24.850
and going and, and a
Testament to how straight forward

355
00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:28.810
The project is. So presumably
then if you are sitting

356
00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:31.510
on top of a rich
API and you have great

357
00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:34.420
web services at Comcast, that
would make your life easier.

358
00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:36.460
Like you couldn't be the
only person, if the data

359
00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:39.160
sources were not there available.
Exactly. Someone's got to do

360
00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:41.110
the backend work and they
just had rich material for

361
00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:43.210
me to pull from. So
I made it very easy,

362
00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:45.850
but again, if you're a
web developer and you're used

363
00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:47.800
to using the web stuff
at all, you'll have no

364
00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:52.770
problem going over. Was it
Jason or XML or soap,

365
00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:55.680
or like, what does a
Comcast backend API look like?

366
00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:58.050
Like you said, get a
list of a hundred children.

367
00:17:58.370 --> 00:18:00.590
Yeah. So they have all
kinds of different things. I

368
00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:03.320
mean, again, I'm a, basically
a web developer. So for

369
00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:04.850
the most part I would
pull on Jason and that

370
00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:07.700
just worked best for me
personally. But again, like you

371
00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:12.260
can use anything you'd really
want, And these, these APIs,

372
00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:14.570
once you've authenticated, like I
guess they have to figure

373
00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:17.300
out that you're a Comcast
person. Right. Like I don't

374
00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:19.490
have Comcast. So if I
tried to log into this

375
00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:22.550
app, somehow they'd know, I
didn't really have Comcast. Yes,

376
00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:25.520
that's correct. So you've, you're
presented with a, a user

377
00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:28.520
sign in screen and it'll
ask for your Comcast credentials,

378
00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:33.020
which is generally a name
followed by.comcast.net. And it would

379
00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:34.940
do a quick check to
say, Hey, this name doesn't

380
00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:37.070
exist. So you're not going
to have access to the

381
00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:40.670
app. So it's as simple
as that. Okay. And then

382
00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:42.380
once they've logged in, they're
in and they're pretty much,

383
00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:44.510
it's just seamless. It's always
there. I've used it, the

384
00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:46.340
three 60 app, which has
been out for about a

385
00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:48.110
year and a half. Now,
if you've used that it

386
00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:51.890
would be the same experience
roughly, but with the new

387
00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:54.920
styling of the Xbox one,
Is this the app that

388
00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:56.990
you wrote? Is it a,
is it a rewrite of

389
00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:58.940
the three 60 app or
is it an evolution of

390
00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:02.540
the three 60 app? Absolutely.
An evolution. Yeah. So I

391
00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:05.510
try to do my best
to merge with Comcast's current

392
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:08.330
UI is while still running
within the guidelines of Xbox

393
00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:12.440
one. So, you know, often
you'll hear UX folks talk

394
00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:16.010
about, is this a native
app or is this a,

395
00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:19.430
is it an app that's
geared for this specific platform?

396
00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:22.880
Or is this an app
that is branded with Comcast

397
00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:25.490
or your specific company? So
I try to do my

398
00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:27.410
best to merge the two
together. And I think it

399
00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:29.990
turned out pretty well. Yeah.
That's gotta be a real

400
00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:33.860
challenge to try to keep
the identity of the company

401
00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:35.480
that you're writing the app
for. Like, you want it

402
00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:38.420
to look and feel like
Comcast in the colors and

403
00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:41.300
the fonts and the styles
and the general feel, cause

404
00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:43.280
you want them to feel
like they have arrived at

405
00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:45.830
a location. You know what
I mean? Like we are

406
00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:48.170
in the Comcast world right
now, but at the same

407
00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:51.440
time it should look like
every other. Yeah. And you

408
00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:56.600
know, sometimes you can have
conflicts in that for a

409
00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:59.060
number of reasons. Microsoft may
say, well, we have to

410
00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:01.850
reserve this space in particular.
For example, if you ever

411
00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:04.430
use connect, you'll see in
the top right corner, all

412
00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:06.860
of your dialogue or gestures
appear there, you'll see a

413
00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:09.860
little microphone pop-up. So I
couldn't populate that space with

414
00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:14.090
any content. Whereas the guidelines
for a specific app or

415
00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:16.340
UI for your company may
say, Hey, you've got to

416
00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:18.170
fill us with something. So
you kind of have to

417
00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:20.330
blend the best of both
worlds and keep both parties

418
00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:24.380
satisfied. So you go and
you get your Jason, you

419
00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:26.540
fill your lists up with
the movies and the pictures

420
00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:28.400
that you want. You let
people scroll around and you

421
00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:31.010
have different ways to search
and sort and filter and

422
00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:32.840
do all that kind of
stuff. When you want to

423
00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:36.530
play the movie, then is
it just a handled? I

424
00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:39.930
mean, you just give it
a stream and a, a

425
00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:42.800
size of the window and
it just it's done. Yeah.

426
00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:45.230
Well, so the, the Xbox
will handle all the scaling

427
00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:47.500
and the size for you.
I'm just pointing it towards

428
00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:50.290
a stream and you could
write your own video player

429
00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:54.130
if you wanted. But in
this case, Microsoft already has

430
00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:57.010
one called player framework, which
is open source and it's

431
00:20:57.010 --> 00:21:01.360
available on all Microsoft platforms.
Oh yeah. So they have

432
00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:05.560
smooth streaming play, ready, DRN,
a number of other features

433
00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:07.870
add there as well. So
that's when I started using,

434
00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:10.120
but anyone can, can look
for it and it's open

435
00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:12.580
for every device it's done
in C sharp, C plus

436
00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:16.110
plus. And JavaScript. Do you
use player framework for that

437
00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:18.780
stuff? Yes, absolutely. No sense
in reinventing the wheel, right.

438
00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:21.450
Well, yeah. I mean, you've
got the scrubber, which is

439
00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:24.000
the thing that lets use,
you know, seek around the

440
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.090
timing forward and backward. I
mean, it's, it's pretty rote

441
00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:30.180
stuff. And presumably if everyone
uses the same framework, then

442
00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:31.950
everyone will have a good
experience when they're playing the

443
00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:34.380
video, Still are some things
that need to be added

444
00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:37.260
at some point, for example,
a lot of people like

445
00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:39.660
sail, the FCC doesn't do
anything well, in fact, they,

446
00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:42.360
they do do quite a
bit, especially for the end

447
00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:46.260
user. For example, accessibility is
a big concern for the

448
00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:50.250
FCC and Comcast in general.
So put yourself in the

449
00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:53.130
shoes of someone who can't
see or hear very well,

450
00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:55.770
but they still wanna enjoy
content with their family. So

451
00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:58.740
what the FCC has mandated
is that in 2014, this

452
00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:02.340
year we have to have
audio or subtitles. I should

453
00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:05.970
say that are customizable. That
was my next question. Yes.

454
00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:08.820
I forgot what the actual
name of that mandate is

455
00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:12.120
off the top of my
head, but it slows down

456
00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:14.160
a few companies because you
have to get it done.

457
00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:16.110
But once you get past
those hurdles, it makes the

458
00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:19.830
experience more enjoyable for everybody,
Right? So those are presumably

459
00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:22.080
some kind of data transformation
job. They need to make

460
00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:24.930
sure that they're producing those
captions in the right format

461
00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:26.700
and then feed them into
the player framework and they

462
00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:29.340
look right, Totally. So you
may be watching a movie

463
00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:33.540
that is, has a brightly
lit background, but it may

464
00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:37.560
be difficult for a handicapped
person to see or someone

465
00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:40.350
who's visually impaired. So they
need the ability to increase

466
00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:42.900
the font size, to change
the colors or change the

467
00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:45.600
shading behind it. So those
are some features that are

468
00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:48.930
still being added to Microsoft
player framework. But I think

469
00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:51.720
in the near future, they
will be far more enriched.

470
00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:54.090
One of the other things
that I wanted to ask

471
00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:57.090
you about is it, you
did a blog post on

472
00:22:57.090 --> 00:23:03.000
your site about, about smart
glass. And like I said

473
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.860
before, you know, I worked
for the company, but I,

474
00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:07.710
you know, I have iPhones
and iPads and you know,

475
00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:11.070
I'm pretty much a mixed,
a mixed household. And I

476
00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:13.290
feel like smart glass is
like one of these really

477
00:23:13.290 --> 00:23:16.950
amazing things that like no
one knows about like people

478
00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:19.470
who read the verge and
end gadget and Gizmodo know

479
00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:21.420
about it. Yeah. But if
you like talk to a

480
00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:23.400
random person who has an
Xbox, they don't know what

481
00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:26.010
this is and that's a
shame cause it's pretty fricking

482
00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:30.480
amazing. I agree. I agree.
Like you said, smart glass

483
00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:34.680
is, it is incredible. It's
just, that's not really pushed

484
00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:37.110
that much at the moment
or many developers just haven't

485
00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:40.320
really got behind it. I
think largely because they're just

486
00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:41.910
trying to get their apps
out at the moment and

487
00:23:41.910 --> 00:23:46.460
better understand everything. But essentially
glass is a second screen

488
00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:50.060
experience that has added value
or supplements what you're currently

489
00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:53.750
doing. So it can, it's
basically a container that you

490
00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:56.690
can download from the app
store for whichever device you're

491
00:23:56.690 --> 00:24:00.800
using. And it then contains
and harnesses, a website that

492
00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:03.920
you'd built. I say website
loosely. And that essentially all

493
00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:07.040
it's doing is pointing to
our URL with again, HTML,

494
00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:11.420
JavaScript, and CSS. So for
example, if I was going

495
00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:15.740
to turn on the Comcast
Xfinity app, as soon as

496
00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:18.140
I launched that, and it
notices that I have a

497
00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:21.470
second screen device, like my
mum mobile phone, and I

498
00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:24.440
also have smart glass installed
on it, it'll start the

499
00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:27.920
explanatory second screen experience on
my phone as well. And

500
00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:29.450
what does that, do you
have that, does that exist?

501
00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:31.900
Yes, I was working on
that as well. Okay. What

502
00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:33.400
does it do? What do
I get on my phone

503
00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:36.580
or my tablet? If I'm
playing Xfinity, It allowed you

504
00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:40.150
to, again, browse the video
on demand catalog without interrupting

505
00:24:40.150 --> 00:24:43.030
the experience of what was
currently on screen. So, Okay.

506
00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:45.310
So you're watching a movie
and still going through the

507
00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:49.450
catalog. That's right. So it
adds features like basically I'd

508
00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:52.000
sit down my family, watch
a movie and thought interrupting

509
00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.970
their experience. I can pick
different movies while still having

510
00:24:55.090 --> 00:24:59.140
a movie playing. But additionally,
I had a little pullout

511
00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:00.670
for a remote. So you
hit a button, the top

512
00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:03.430
left corner and have all
the buttons and functions that

513
00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:06.070
were available to your Xbox
controller. In addition to a

514
00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:08.740
little scrub bar that worked
in real time and a,

515
00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:10.990
an avatar. So had your
name and your avatar kind

516
00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:14.500
of dancing back and forth
on the remote. That's awesome.

517
00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:17.590
I, the thing that my
first experience to that made

518
00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:20.740
me realize that I want
to play, this was the

519
00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:24.820
dead rising game. It's the
zombie game and I've got

520
00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:27.580
an iPad. And when I
run the iPad smart glass

521
00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:29.620
app, while dead rising is
on you get a map,

522
00:25:29.890 --> 00:25:33.550
right? Oh my goodness. It
completely changes the way that

523
00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:36.400
you think about what you're
doing. Like I'll put the

524
00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:39.610
map on my, on my
knee or my lap. And

525
00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:41.990
it gives you this kind
of heads up display, you

526
00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:43.240
know what it's like picture
and picture. You can put

527
00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:46.660
it anywhere you want, and
you could even have a

528
00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:49.570
second person sitting next to
you like playing along in

529
00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:51.190
the sense of they're on
the map, they're looking at

530
00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:53.650
your inventory, they're moving around
the app, telling you stuff,

531
00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:57.130
You'd get calls from, you
know, NPCs and things like

532
00:25:57.130 --> 00:25:59.500
that. Well, that's, what's so
brilliant about the way that

533
00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:02.170
the dead rising folks did
it is that they added

534
00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:05.290
exclusive content that wouldn't, you
wouldn't get, unless you had

535
00:26:05.290 --> 00:26:08.560
smart glass, right? So you
get the it's awesome. They

536
00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:11.290
treat it like a phone.
So you get cell phone

537
00:26:11.290 --> 00:26:14.680
calls from other characters in
the game, like, go help

538
00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:18.310
me, you know? Yeah. There
was really, I believe that

539
00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:21.400
they have done the best
job of exhibiting exactly what

540
00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:23.860
smart glass can do. And
again, it was very, very

541
00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:26.680
easy to write for most
of this is actually available

542
00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:29.380
publicly on channel nine. I
know we have quite a

543
00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:32.380
bit there, but it was
revealed to fill 2012. And

544
00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:35.860
again, this is a, a
JavaScript API that exposes all

545
00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:39.640
the device capabilities of the
current device you're using. So

546
00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:42.820
for example, if I'm using
a windows phone, windows, eight

547
00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:46.830
iPhone or Android, I can
use the accelerometer gyroscope, haptic.

548
00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:50.010
That is all available to
me through a very, very

549
00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:52.890
simple JavaScript API. So you're
not having to do any

550
00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:57.360
of that yourself and I'm
platform agnostic. So I would

551
00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:02.190
just I'd write a small
function for accelerometer and it

552
00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:04.410
worked on every device. Didn't
matter what the screen looked

553
00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:08.970
like, how big it was,
tablet or phone. And yeah,

554
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.890
I think I would love
to see more developers take

555
00:27:10.890 --> 00:27:14.900
advantage of this in particular
with games. Yeah, definitely. So

556
00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:17.930
it's more than just a,
we're going to open up

557
00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:20.390
a frame and go to
a website. I mean, it

558
00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:24.410
is, it's a little kind
of runtime for your application.

559
00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:27.350
Runs on Android runs on
windows, phone runs on iPad.

560
00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:30.350
Yeah, that's right. It extracts
all this stuff away. And

561
00:27:30.650 --> 00:27:32.360
the example I like to
give and I'm waiting for

562
00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:34.190
someone to bank on this
large idea, I would do

563
00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:36.740
it myself. If I have
the time is I picture

564
00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:40.190
a time when I'm playing
Dungeons dragons with friends and

565
00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:42.980
on the dungeon master with
my smart glass device. And

566
00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:45.290
all my other friends are
playing with the game pads

567
00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:48.650
on the console. So this
way I can spawn creatures

568
00:27:48.650 --> 00:27:51.500
or set up new quests
or, you know, throw roadblocks

569
00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:54.170
in their way from my
screen without them ever having

570
00:27:54.170 --> 00:27:57.560
to see anything. So that's
cool. Cool. Yeah. So I'm

571
00:27:57.580 --> 00:27:59.690
still waiting for someone to
come by and really create

572
00:27:59.690 --> 00:28:01.880
that experience for us. I
thought it would be neat

573
00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:04.310
to have a kind of
a squad based game, like

574
00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:07.070
a call of duty or
something where you would you'd

575
00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:09.680
have the, the pad would
be like, as if you

576
00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:11.930
were in the game as
if you're really there, you

577
00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:13.490
pull the thing out in
the, you like draw a

578
00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:17.840
line, right. You guys go
over here and I'll meet

579
00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:19.760
you there. So you'd like,
it's kinda like, you know,

580
00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:23.030
like Madden F NFL, right.
The way he used to

581
00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:25.280
draw on the screen, you
know, just, you know, go

582
00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:27.890
here, button left and I'll
meet you behind the warehouse.

583
00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:32.240
Yeah. I think battlefield four
has that called commander or

584
00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:35.090
something or commander app it's
similar, but I haven't really

585
00:28:35.270 --> 00:28:37.400
dove that far into that.
I don't know if available

586
00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:40.760
on smart class though. I
definitely cannot stress enough that

587
00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:42.440
if anyone has an Xbox,
whether it be a three

588
00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:45.440
60 or a, a one
to get the smart glass

589
00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:48.140
on whatever device you have,
even literally last night, we

590
00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:52.100
were playing music. We were
having dinner and I, the

591
00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:54.860
kids were unable to concentrate
with the music going. So

592
00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:57.740
I was able to pause
it from the phone. I

593
00:28:57.740 --> 00:29:00.470
could see what song was
playing changed, tracks, pause the

594
00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:03.530
music. So whatever experience you're
having, whether it be a

595
00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:06.170
Comcast or whether it be
Netflix or whether it be,

596
00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:09.050
you know, paddle field, you're
going to get a different

597
00:29:09.050 --> 00:29:11.390
experience on the phone. And
it all happens automatically. And

598
00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:14.360
it's all contextual works really,
really great. Even if there

599
00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:18.290
wasn't an app written for
a specific title, the Microsoft

600
00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:21.350
generic smart glass app is
available by default. So you

601
00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:23.570
have all the buttons available
to you that you would

602
00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:25.790
normally have on a game
pad. That's up, down left

603
00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:29.480
writes fast forward rewind. And
like I said, information about

604
00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:31.820
what's currently being played on
screen, so they couldn't make

605
00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:34.610
it any easier for people.
And on your, on your

606
00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:36.410
site, you talk a little
bit about this and it

607
00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:39.470
seems like if you, again,
if you haven't got that

608
00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:42.340
set up, you can still
simulate smart glass with Just

609
00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:44.650
two devices and a website.
And then you use like

610
00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:47.170
web sockets to talk between
them. Yes, exactly. So that's

611
00:29:47.170 --> 00:29:49.480
how I got my start
before I received my deaf

612
00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:52.240
kit was I had two
windows, eight devices, one was

613
00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:54.880
pro the other one was
an RT tablet and using

614
00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:58.270
web sockets, which is basically
just opening a connection between

615
00:29:58.270 --> 00:30:01.780
two devices over your local
wifi. One says, Hey, I'm

616
00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:03.580
open for a connection. The
other one says, Hey, I'm

617
00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:05.620
going to send out a
message. And all you do

618
00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:09.580
is pass a Jason object
back and forth. And I'm

619
00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:12.280
a little if statement or
switch statement to discern what's

620
00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:15.760
going on. So give you
a rough example. I had

621
00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:18.250
a controller and I would
click on an image on

622
00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:22.690
my mobile device. And that
image would then tell my

623
00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:26.590
windows eight tablet or my
windows eight machine to point

624
00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:29.260
to this URL and play
the movie. So it was

625
00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:31.000
as simple as that. And
then I brought that concept

626
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.500
right over the smart glass
and a couple of days.

627
00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:35.320
And how is, are you
talking to the, are you

628
00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:38.920
talking on the same network
like you have? So the

629
00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:42.070
web sockets works because you're
on the same wifi era,

630
00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:44.290
basically talking back and forth
between the phone and the

631
00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:47.170
tablet and the Xbox. You're
not going out onto the

632
00:30:47.170 --> 00:30:50.260
internet. And then back in
that's correct. Smart glass handles

633
00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:52.480
that a number of different
ways. That's one of the

634
00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:54.520
ways and go up to
the cloud, come back down.

635
00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:57.610
And then once that connection
is established, it then just

636
00:30:57.610 --> 00:31:00.280
uses your local wifi. But
even if that wasn't available

637
00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:02.680
and you just had a,
a 3g device without why

638
00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:05.530
five, for whatever reason, that
works too, but web sockets

639
00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:09.160
against simplifies all that and
handles it one way. That's

640
00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:11.650
what I was wondering why,
cause it's almost impossibly fast

641
00:31:11.650 --> 00:31:14.380
once you get it working
because we have no delay

642
00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:16.300
at all. Yeah, exactly. And
I have to have, if

643
00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:18.880
I'm using it as a
controller and I'm like swiping

644
00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:21.730
on my phone in order
to move the tile around

645
00:31:22.030 --> 00:31:23.920
it's instantaneous. And I was
like, this has to be

646
00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:25.750
local. It has to be
talking about because you know,

647
00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:27.850
what is the second someone
notices? I'm a bit of

648
00:31:27.850 --> 00:31:30.280
July, you've really taken them
out of that experience and

649
00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:31.810
ruined it for them. So
at that point they wouldn't

650
00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:34.240
even want to use something
like that. So that's why

651
00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:36.220
I often suggest to people
wanting to make games or

652
00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:39.460
apps for, you know, the,
the new console generation I

653
00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:43.450
suggest starting with windows eight,
getting that proven concept done.

654
00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:46.600
And then you're really grabbing
Microsoft's attention because you're showing

655
00:31:47.270 --> 00:31:50.680
and illustrating very new ways
of using their technology. Yeah,

656
00:31:50.770 --> 00:31:55.180
definitely. So are you still
doing the indie dev podcast?

657
00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.510
Yes, I do that once
every two weeks and I

658
00:31:58.510 --> 00:32:03.190
interview independent developers for 30
minutes to get a bit

659
00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:05.890
of background information about them.
So we start with how

660
00:32:05.890 --> 00:32:08.680
they got their start with
development and finally leading up

661
00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:10.990
to the current projects that
they're working on now. Okay,

662
00:32:10.990 --> 00:32:13.810
cool. Well, I would definitely
encourage people. I'll put the

663
00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:16.780
details in the show notes,
check out Dave's site. He's

664
00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:18.760
got information on how to
get your app on the

665
00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:22.180
Xbox one details on smart
glass, like we just talked

666
00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:24.070
about. And then of course
you can check out his,

667
00:32:24.730 --> 00:32:28.300
his new show, indie dev
podcast. Thanks so much for

668
00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:30.400
chatting with me today, Dave.
Thanks for having me. It's

669
00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:33.520
been a pleasure. This has
been another episode of Hanselminutes

670
00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:34.870
and we'll see you again
next week.
