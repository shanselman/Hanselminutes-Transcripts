Scott talks with Tim Ferris
bestselling author of the four

hour work week Scott Hanselman.
And this is another episode

13
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.070
of Hansel minutes, and I'm
down here in Sebastopol, California

14
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.010
at foo camp. And I've
been lucky enough to sit

15
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.210
down with Tim Ferris, the
New York bestselling author of the

16
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.660
four hour workweek. That is
for the number four, not

17
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.160
40, not 14, four hour
workweek. How's it going, Tim?

18
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.810
I was going right. I
want to understand how you're

19
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.110
able to synthesize what is
a 40 or 60 or

20
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.470
80 hour workweek to those
four or few hours that

21
00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.650
really are the most value
added. I mean, are you

22
00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.090
just outsourcing everything that's tedious?
No, I think that that's

23
00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.450
the most popular The topic
to discuss because it gets

24
00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.270
people Well hot and heavy
and it's political and emotional,

25
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.510
but at the core, the
most important concept is that

26
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.750
of reductionism. And what I
mean by that is it's

27
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.230
very easy to make the
simple complex, but it's, it's

28
00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.110
quite challenging to make the
complex simple. Once you identify

29
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.250
the fewest moving parts, what
you might call primitives in

30
00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.360
language learning, for example, that
comprise the entire language or

31
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.780
the entire objective. So in
the case of work, if

32
00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.960
you do an 80 20
analysis of your inputs, you

33
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:41.720
find that you'll find a
very disproportionate ratio of input

34
00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.450
to output. So 20% of
the activities that you're engaged

35
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.550
in are generally correlated to
80% of the desired outcomes,

36
00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.500
but it's usually skewed even
more than that. So what

37
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.500
you find that you find
that this type of analysis

38
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.860
ports very easily to almost
any activity. So in the

39
00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.370
case of tango, for example,
did my first tango class

40
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.550
and in Argentina, and then
five months later competed in

41
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.880
the world championships and made
it to the semifinals representing

42
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.300
sinusitis as an American, which
has never been done and

43
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.400
then set a world record.
And the reason I was

44
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.430
able to do that is
not because I mastered tango

45
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.480
in some amorphous all encompassing
way. It's because I was

46
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.630
able to identify that there
were two components that, that

47
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.020
really determined everything else, footwork
and lead. And if I

48
00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.570
was able to learn those
two things and really focus

49
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.510
on refining those two things
that had my desired outcome.

50
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.910
And so it's really looking
at at problems and realizing

51
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.730
that the simplest solution is
usually the best all outcomes

52
00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.680
raiser, and really just trying
to reduce it to these,

53
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.300
these primitive elements. And does
that work in most everything?

54
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.920
I mean, some people want
to say that the 80

55
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.280
20 rule basically makes you
a, a person that's getting

56
00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.770
a, basically a B average.
I mean, you can, if

57
00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:56.580
you you're doing, you're not
truly excelling, but you're being,

58
00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.220
you're very competent. Can you
take it to that next

59
00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.990
level of people? I don't
think that's true. I think

60
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.690
it depends on how you
measure competency, which is a

61
00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.190
separate discussion all in itself.
But I think it's possible

62
00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.810
to be extremely world-class in
many, many things, if you

63
00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.110
focus on what's important and
I believe that that can

64
00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.240
be taught as well. So
I think that the 80

65
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:23.430
20, the term 80 20
is misleading because it can

66
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.540
be 99 one, it can
be 99 20. So what

67
00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.000
I mean by that is
it doesn't need to add

68
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.770
up to a hundred either.
So when people say, Oh,

69
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.710
80%, well then they think
in terms of grade point

70
00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.360
average, but there's, there's a
point of diminishing returns with

71
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.350
any activity. So for example,
in learning languages, and I've,

72
00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.640
that's one of my various
geek out of sessions, you

73
00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.550
find that to be 95%
accurate in a given language

74
00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.570
conversationally can be accomplished very
quickly in about six months,

75
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.610
three to six months, even
though something like Mandarin Chinese

76
00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.330
or Japanese, but to get
to, let's say the 97%

77
00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.350
accuracy range could take 20,
25 years. And you find

78
00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.640
there's that same radical point
of diminishing returns with almost

79
00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.870
anything, whether it's sports or
business. So, you know, putting

80
00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.710
in the first two hours
of email may accomplish 99%

81
00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.200
of what you want versus
putting in 20 hours of

82
00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.950
email. For example, That's really
that that just clicked for

83
00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:26.010
me. Now, help me, this
may be a silly tangent,

84
00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.490
but help me understand how
that explains, why those first

85
00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.980
two, three hours on any
plane flight. I get more

86
00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:35.730
email done than at any
session where I sit down

87
00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:37.800
consciously in my office and
try to do my email.

88
00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.250
I think one of the
reasons is, and this, this

89
00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.310
may be more of a
technical level, but Scoble said

90
00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.650
the same thing to me,
coincidentally. And the reason is

91
00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:53.070
that you're focusing on output
and exclusively output. So most

92
00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.170
people try to do both
at the same time. So

93
00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.070
what happens? You have 50
email, you answer the first

94
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.210
five and then ping, ping,
you start getting replies. And

95
00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:06.200
that interrupts the function that
you're trying to batch, which

96
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.650
is that output. And then
of course the other option,

97
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.920
or the other explanation is
that if you're in a

98
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:16.940
sitting in a fuselage hurdling
through space in the window

99
00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.360
seat and you can't move,
you don't have any crutch

100
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.540
activities immediately within reach. So
you can't go to the

101
00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:28.040
bathroom, you can't reorganize your
file folders. You can't grab

102
00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.960
a cup of coffee and
go talk to your colleague

103
00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.840
about something that's unimportant. You,
you really have no crutch

104
00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.750
activity to resort to. So
I think those two certainly

105
00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:38.170
contributes. So then if I
apply the analysis that we're

106
00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:40.930
talking about to trying to
make that possible in my

107
00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:43.750
regular life, when I'm not
an airplane, I unplug the,

108
00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:47.890
unplug the network cable and
sit in a, in a

109
00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:51.760
stimulated tube in my office
and try to get that

110
00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:55.180
stuff handled. Sure. Yeah. I
mean, you can simulate it

111
00:06:55.450 --> 00:07:00.280
the way that I look
at developing any skill set

112
00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:06.280
is you have sort of
three layers of importance and

113
00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:09.610
that determine your results. The
first is environment. So environment

114
00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:12.580
is, is the number one
variable that you need to

115
00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:17.230
optimize. Secondly, you have the
material. So the what, the,

116
00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:20.140
what of what you do.
And then last you have

117
00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:25.210
the method, all right. The
how, and most people approach

118
00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:27.880
it in exactly the opposite
order. So they focus on

119
00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.160
how to be very good
at something before they determine

120
00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.310
whether it's important or not.
Then they focus on doing

121
00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:35.410
that thing. And then they
look at environment as an

122
00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:40.030
afterthought and I approach it
top down the other direction.

123
00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:42.610
So for example, when I
go to, if I go

124
00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:44.970
to Berlin to learn German
like I did, or if

125
00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:47.320
I go to Dubai to
learn Arabic, which I'm going

126
00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:50.440
to do in two months
or so, once my learning

127
00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.510
curve flattens out with this
book, I'm going to disappear

128
00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:57.610
for awhile. I will probably
in Dubai, for example, get,

129
00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:00.610
get an apartment that is
fairly far outside the city.

130
00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:03.250
So what does that do?
It immediately builds in probably

131
00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:06.190
two hour commute time. And
I will, I will learn

132
00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:10.300
Arabic in that commute time
because I'm creating that fuselage

133
00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:13.570
type isolation, but that's the
way I learned Japanese way.

134
00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:16.030
I learned Mandarin almost all
the languages that I've learned,

135
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:21.670
Setting yourself up for success,
Right? Because humans have very

136
00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:25.480
poor impulse control and they
have very bored distraction filtering.

137
00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:30.220
So it's, it's far more
effective to create the proper

138
00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:33.370
environment that doesn't allow you
to misbehave than to depend

139
00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:38.140
on making decisions about discipline.
At every point through the

140
00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:42.790
process, Is this really effective
single tasking? I mean, I'm

141
00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:45.820
hearing that there's a very
conscious decision that this single

142
00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:48.280
task that I invoking on
focusing on is the right

143
00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:49.900
thing. I noticed that we
were going to talk earlier

144
00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:52.450
day, you were doing a
hurdler stretch while you were

145
00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:55.500
listening to. And I said,
well, maybe his is that

146
00:08:55.500 --> 00:09:01.820
he's multitask. No, no I
single task. So the, the

147
00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:06.920
hurdler stretch doesn't require any
mental Ram. So I'm able

148
00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:09.650
to do that. It's, it's
not a, it's a passive

149
00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:12.890
activity, not an active activity.
So you have different mental

150
00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:16.310
faculties that are consumed by
different things. And you don't

151
00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:20.960
want to have specific mental
applications. If I can really

152
00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:24.890
push the analogy that are
drawing on that same, that

153
00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:28.070
same faculty. So you find
when, when people try to

154
00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:33.260
answer email, I am and
do God knows what at

155
00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.240
the same time, while eating
a sandwich, it just doesn't

156
00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:37.940
work. It's calling on some
of the same mental faculties

157
00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:41.180
and you outstrip Ram quite
quickly. And even if you

158
00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:43.580
have, so for example, we
were talking about GTD or

159
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:48.080
before the interview and what
David Allen refers to as open

160
00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:52.280
loops. They also sit in
the background like, like an

161
00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:55.180
application that just consumes Ram
the entire time. So it

162
00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:57.110
is important to close those
out as well. Yeah. On

163
00:09:57.110 --> 00:10:00.710
previous podcasts, I've called that
the psychic weight. Like I

164
00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:02.990
have a great deal of
psychic weight, just pulling me

165
00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:04.880
down. Cause I know that
when I get back to

166
00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:07.370
the hotel, I've got this
crushing amount of email that

167
00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:10.040
needs to be caught up
on. And it's all just

168
00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:14.150
every, every line item and
outlook is equally important just

169
00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:16.400
by virtue of the way
it appears in outlook. Right.

170
00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:17.900
I noticed when I emailed
you to try to set

171
00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:20.390
up this interview, I got
two things from you in

172
00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:23.330
the email immediately. I got
an out of office reply,

173
00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:25.700
but not typical when it
said I checked my email

174
00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:27.440
every two to four days,
cause I'm trying to get

175
00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:29.750
work done. So bear with
me. And then a few

176
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:31.850
hours later, I got a
very kind email from a

177
00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:34.880
woman named Amy who lives.
God knows where I don't

178
00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:39.440
know Vancouver, Vancouver, Canada. Yeah.
You're outsourced to Vancouver, Canada.

179
00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:42.140
And she said, you know,
this sounds like a very

180
00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:44.390
exciting thing. She CC'd your
editor. Let's see if we

181
00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:47.450
can get on his schedule.
She explained the situation. And

182
00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.820
while I initially thought, cause
I'd heard that you'd done

183
00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:51.770
this kind of outsourcing and
I don't mean to use

184
00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:53.300
the word outsourcing and maybe
there's a better word. It's

185
00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:56.390
funny when I heard this,
I said, well, gosh, am

186
00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:59.690
I, am I that important
to, you know, and I

187
00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:01.700
had a little kind of
talk with myself, should I,

188
00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:03.470
should I do this? Is
this valuable? Would people be

189
00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:07.460
insulted if I didn't answer
their emails personally, but then

190
00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:09.590
at the same time it
did let me understand that.

191
00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:12.470
Well, you know, Tim's got
stuff to do. I better

192
00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:16.220
make my communications with this
individual. So Amy, a value

193
00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:18.680
added. So I ended up
writing her an email that

194
00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:21.950
was more detailed and more
specific in the amount of

195
00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:24.290
time it would save you.
And it eventually got down

196
00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:26.720
to Well, that's why I
recognized your name when you

197
00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:29.150
came up to me today
and I wouldn't recognize the

198
00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:32.210
names of the other 150
or a thousand people that

199
00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:35.990
email me each day. I've
never seen an assistant email

200
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:38.060
like that. And it may,
and she also included at

201
00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:40.940
the bottom. She said, you
know, Amy executive system, this

202
00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:46.640
email is, she had checkboxes
bloggable please ask private. She

203
00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:49.010
checked please. And I thought
that was fantastic. Cause I

204
00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:51.860
never know what I, when
I email someone, if it's

205
00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:54.040
going to show up, copy
pasted, flat out on their

206
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:57.300
blog. I really thought that
was impressive. I have to

207
00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:01.920
give credit to Tom <inaudible>
of Silicon Valley, Silicon Valley

208
00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:04.860
watcher. I borrowed that from
him. And then Amy liked

209
00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:06.330
it so much. I said,
Hey, you should use it

210
00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:08.220
too. I think it's a
good idea considering how much

211
00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:10.920
email be coming in. So
do you end up, does

212
00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:13.020
she, I assume she has
access to your email. So

213
00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:15.030
then when you get to
your box, it's there are

214
00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:18.000
specific actions for you to
take. I have multiple email

215
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.600
accounts depending on their function.
So I have a semi-public

216
00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:26.040
email account that goes to
Amy. I have other business

217
00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:29.310
accounts for my separate businesses,
which are primarily handled or

218
00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:32.190
at least filtered by other
systems. And then I have

219
00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:36.060
my sort of personal email
that I use for immediate

220
00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:39.980
action items that only I
can attend to. And it's,

221
00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:41.400
it's very clear what I
have to do with them.

222
00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:44.610
And I've actually streamlined that
further to the point where

223
00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:49.650
she no longer forwards email
to me at all, which

224
00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:53.190
is very common. That is
not common. What's what's most

225
00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:56.100
common is what I did
initially with Amy who manages

226
00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:58.530
other virtual assistants as well
with act on my behalf.

227
00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:02.700
So she's more of an
operations manager, which, which was,

228
00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:04.470
she would send the emails
to me that she felt

229
00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:08.400
required my attention. And what
I found was much more

230
00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:12.150
effective was simply getting on
the phone with her once

231
00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:14.490
a day. And she would
have, I laid out a

232
00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:18.540
set of rules essentially for
preparing for the call and

233
00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:20.490
it's bang, bang, bang. I
jumped on the phone with

234
00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:22.560
her today at four o'clock
on the right up here

235
00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:24.870
and handled all the email
that I needed to handle.

236
00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.510
Meaning I told her what
she needed to do in

237
00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:31.260
about four minutes. And I
get more than a thousand

238
00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.780
emails a day. Sounds like
what we would in the

239
00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:35.580
project management. One of the
agile, where we call this

240
00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:39.960
a scrum, it's like a
rugby scrum. Every day we

241
00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:42.000
have a meeting, it's a
standup meeting. We get together

242
00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:44.520
and we say, what are
you working on? What did

243
00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:46.080
you do yesterday? What are
you doing today? And what

244
00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:48.300
do I need to do
to get that problem whenever

245
00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:50.880
you facing out of the
way? Yep. Anything else is

246
00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:54.030
peripheral? And they last more
than 15 minutes, you're doing

247
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:56.400
it wrong. Sure. It sounds
like you're having a daily

248
00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:59.100
scrum with your operations team
to find out what do

249
00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:01.260
I need to do and
how can I empower you

250
00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.360
to do something on my
Yeah, sure. And, and the

251
00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:04.980
other thing that I do,
and I talk about this

252
00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:09.030
in the four hour workweek,
but is I, I set

253
00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:11.340
certain guidelines and I expect
that I will have small

254
00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:14.010
problems I need to fix.
I don't try to prevent

255
00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:17.490
every problem because if you
focus on trying to prevent

256
00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:21.150
every problem, you really can't
take the proactive steps on

257
00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:24.210
mission, critical tasks that you
should be focusing your resources

258
00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:28.800
on. So for example, I'm
giving Amy increasing levels of

259
00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:32.820
decision, making ability with emails
as she becomes familiar with

260
00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:35.220
my preferences. And I'm sure
every once in a while,

261
00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:40.680
something will slip through, but
the alternative is handholding and

262
00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:44.130
checking every email that she
reads, which, which would not

263
00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:48.000
only not save me time,
but it would consume her

264
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.830
time and consume my, my
income. You're actively not to

265
00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:55.170
be a micromanager. If you
don't empower your subordinate right.

266
00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:56.530
Then why do you have
a sport in general? Right?

267
00:14:56.530 --> 00:14:59.140
And the way you empower
them though, is by providing

268
00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:05.680
extremely detailed explicit rules. And
it's not about saying you

269
00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:08.830
seem smart, make the right
decision. There's a certain component

270
00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:12.760
of that, but it's very
minimal and it's, it's supplemental

271
00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:16.540
to having extremely well-defined rules.
So she has a file

272
00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:20.590
that is Tim Ferriss rules.
And every time I sent

273
00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:22.540
her an email, let's say
she sends me an email

274
00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:24.820
and she asks, how should
I respond to this? And

275
00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:27.430
I'll respond and I'll say
new rule. And then I'll

276
00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:31.690
define exactly the principle that
she can use to respond

277
00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:33.370
to these types of emails
in the future. And she'll

278
00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:37.420
cut and paste that into
the running document that she

279
00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:40.510
uses. And she also shares
with her some more subordinate

280
00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:45.160
VA's whom she manages. So
it's, it's, it's very effective.

281
00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:48.550
Is it, is this a,
Is she your full time

282
00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:50.230
virtual assistant? Does she have
other people that she works

283
00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:52.930
for? Oh, she works for
other people. Although I think

284
00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:56.050
she's probably working close to
full time with me at

285
00:15:56.050 --> 00:16:00.130
the moment, but I'm actively
taking steps to, to cut

286
00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:02.560
down on the number of
for hours. She's perfectly happy

287
00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:05.470
to work full time because
I'm paying her for that

288
00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:10.990
time. But it's, I'm actively
trying to and recruiting her

289
00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:12.940
help to cut down on
the number of hours because

290
00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:16.870
it forces us to refine
the rules. And ultimately, because

291
00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:18.820
right now she's, she said,
you know, I'm happy to

292
00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:20.620
put in X number of
hours, which is a lot

293
00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:21.940
of hours, but I said,
you know what? This is

294
00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:24.670
just the beginning. And from
the outset you have to

295
00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:28.120
ask yourself, you know, can
this system scale? So Amy

296
00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:30.430
is doing a great job
right now. Fantastic. She's putting

297
00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:32.560
in 40 hours a week,
but I'm getting a thousand

298
00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:34.570
emails a day. What happens
when I'm getting 10,000 emails

299
00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:36.580
a day? Okay. And then
there are a lot of

300
00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:38.380
ways to solve that. I
could simply take down all

301
00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:40.270
my email addresses, which I
may do at one point

302
00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:43.780
simple fix done over five
minutes, but I'm at a

303
00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:46.120
point where I'm still gathering
information from my readers so

304
00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:49.330
I can make improvements. And
there'll be a point of

305
00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:51.130
diminishing returns with that. And
when I hit that point,

306
00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:55.270
I'll remove my email. Now
You're paying an employee 40

307
00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:58.210
hours a week. And that
for some of my listeners

308
00:16:58.210 --> 00:17:01.810
may be a little overwhelming
while he's paying someone. But

309
00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:05.320
you're deriving value for more
from her from more than

310
00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:08.650
you're paying her. I'll put
it this way. If, if

311
00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:11.950
people need to become very
astute at calculating the value

312
00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:14.050
of their time and you
calculate the value of your

313
00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:17.080
time, not only by your
current income, but by what

314
00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:19.930
you could accomplish, if you
were able to create more

315
00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:23.470
time to focus on mission
critical tasks. So if, if

316
00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:25.960
I don't look at it
as let's just say, hypothetically,

317
00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:27.580
I make a hundred thousand
dollars a year. That means

318
00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:29.770
I make $50 an hour.
So if I pay her

319
00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:32.650
$25 an hour, that means
I'm making $25 an hour.

320
00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:37.120
No, that's the starting point.
But for example, if I

321
00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:39.040
spend all my time doing
email, I can't do anything

322
00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:41.980
else and I'm miserable. So
we, we didn't even get

323
00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:45.460
into that facet of the
equation, but let's say instead,

324
00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:48.040
I can spend two days
focusing on an online educational

325
00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:50.940
module that then $99 per
person. And I have a

326
00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:53.760
5% conversion rate from every
visitor to the site and

327
00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:55.410
I get on national TV
and I drive that to

328
00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:57.930
X, Y, and Z. And
then I'm making $150,000 a

329
00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:01.610
month that pays for Amy
right easily. This is the

330
00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:03.230
thing I discovered a few
years ago, which is that

331
00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:07.070
electrons are cheaper to sell
than molecules. Yes, several electrons

332
00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:10.310
all day long, The cheaper
to ship as well. Now

333
00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:14.450
you have some interesting ideas
around cash cash specifically. I

334
00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:16.280
understand that you have a
passion for certain kinds of

335
00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:19.760
cars and things that someone
might think are out of

336
00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:22.580
one's reach. When you look
at it rather than holistically

337
00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:25.070
over a 10 year 20
or 30 year period and

338
00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:27.830
a month to month ins
and outs can become attainable.

339
00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:31.070
Sure, absolutely. I mean, I,
you can get announced. I

340
00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:33.380
saw an Aston Martin DB
nine, which is a fantastic

341
00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:37.520
car with 1500 miles on
eBay, which could be financed

342
00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:42.290
for, for less than I'd
say it was between 1200

343
00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:47.720
and $1,400 a month. And,
but I'll point this out.

344
00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:50.510
I don't have a DB
nine. I don't have a

345
00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:53.060
fast car. I drive a
Volkswagen golf because I'll tell

346
00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:55.610
you what's more important to
me than, than owning a

347
00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:58.760
nice car is being able
to park not being able

348
00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:01.280
to park. I live near
San Francisco infuriates me. So

349
00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:02.960
when I can't take the
train, I want a small

350
00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:08.510
car. And secondly, I take
it a step further. So

351
00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:13.580
ownership is, is a very
little interest to me generally.

352
00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:17.480
And so like, like Tyler
Durden said and fight club,

353
00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:19.220
you know what we own
ends up owning us. And

354
00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:23.150
I believe that's true. I,
I low maintenance of most

355
00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:28.820
things that consume energy and
attention and don't provide more

356
00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:31.910
value than they consume. So
what does that mean? That

357
00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:35.480
means that when, when we
look to buy, because that's

358
00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:39.200
the usual route, a nice
car Lamborghini, Ferrari, what we

359
00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:41.180
want is a certain experience
and we need to define

360
00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:43.820
that experience. And then once
we've defined that experience, there

361
00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:46.280
are much better ways of
achieving it. So when I

362
00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:47.720
go to Dubai, I'm going
to spend a day at

363
00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:50.780
a racetrack and let's just
say that I could afford

364
00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:54.470
to buy an Aston Martin
vanquish. Fantastic. Great. But when

365
00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:56.630
I go to Dubai and
I've, I'm probably in the

366
00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:59.390
process of arranging this, you
know, for less than a

367
00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:02.300
thousand dollars by using other
currencies that I have like

368
00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:06.230
credibility and association, vis-a-vis the
book, this is all I've

369
00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:08.900
planned. All of this out.
I will be able to

370
00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:12.230
race an Enzo Ferrari and
F1 McLaren. Okay. At one

371
00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:17.810
point $2 million car, one of
Larry Ellison's toys, Lamborghini, mercy

372
00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:19.730
logo, and a laundry list
of other cars for an

373
00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:24.080
entire day, for less than
$500, including gasoline. So because

374
00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:26.420
of the realization that it's,
in fact, the experience at

375
00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:29.810
one w one wants more
than it is the actual

376
00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:36.020
physical thing. Absolutely. It's, it's,
it's learning to value and

377
00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:39.770
define, and then value intangibles
because ultimately I think that

378
00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:43.150
most things that we pursue
are intangible. Yeah. I, I

379
00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:44.800
I've traveled a lot as
well. And I think I

380
00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:47.190
can tell you, obviously, from
the languages, from the U

381
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:51.370
U value, filling your, your
life with experience, with travel,

382
00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:54.550
with, with language, with interactions,
with other people, you're probably

383
00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:56.380
a backpack traveler. You probably
don't check a lot of

384
00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:58.950
bags. Yes, no, actually I'm
going to be writing a

385
00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:01.620
blog post soon called how
to, how to, how to

386
00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:04.560
travel the world and contain
your life in 10 pounds.

387
00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:06.960
So that's Awesome. You know,
there's, there's a lot of

388
00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:09.510
the super light hikers are
always trying to squeeze a

389
00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:12.300
few ounces out of stuff.
Whether it's be a water

390
00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:14.550
purifier that they can get
in three ounces, as opposed

391
00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:16.380
to six ounces, it's a
big, big group of people

392
00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:17.880
on the internet that does
it kind of stuff. I

393
00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:20.790
did Malaysia without checking a
bag for two weeks. And

394
00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:22.650
I thought that was an
achievement, but there's other guys

395
00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:23.910
that are pulling that kind
of stuff off in a

396
00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:26.790
backpack. Yeah. There's some, there,
there's some very interesting approaches

397
00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:28.920
and tools out there as
well. I'll certainly be talking

398
00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:31.380
more about those on my
blog in the upcoming, upcoming

399
00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:34.710
weeks and months, especially once
I start leaving myself, I'll

400
00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:36.870
need to every once in
a while throw up the

401
00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:41.820
post and they'll probably be
travel-related. So my brain is

402
00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:43.530
going a thousand miles an
hour. The only thing that

403
00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:45.810
I've successfully outsourced at this
point is the mowing of

404
00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:48.810
my lawn. That was really
easy. Pay him 20 bucks

405
00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:50.970
an hour. I make more
than that. It seemed like

406
00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:53.400
an obvious thing to do,
but I'm realizing that I'm

407
00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:55.890
spending a lot of time
answering email and spending a

408
00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:59.940
lot of time, not providing
substantive value because I think

409
00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:02.970
I'm addicted to urgency, the
classic kind of Covey urgency,

410
00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:06.660
addiction, urgency versus importance. But,
and I'm hearing, I'm kind

411
00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:08.880
of getting some inspiration here,
but I'm wondering is this

412
00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:12.240
just simply that you are
an incredibly willful individual and

413
00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:14.820
that you make the decision
to do this and you

414
00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:17.250
make it, so is this
a series of techniques or

415
00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:20.700
is it a combination? It's
a series of conditioning, actually

416
00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:23.700
more than techniques so I
can prescribe the medicine, but

417
00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:26.310
I can't force people to
take it. And so you

418
00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:29.970
have skillset and then you
have behavior that allows someone

419
00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:34.260
to use that skill set
and behavior is usually limited

420
00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:38.760
by a comfort with discomfort.
So what does that mean?

421
00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:41.130
That means that each person
has a comfortable sphere of

422
00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:46.260
action. And there are a
certain number of options that

423
00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:50.670
they have given their sphere
of comfort. And if you

424
00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:53.700
take small steps to increase
that sphere of comfort, you

425
00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:55.740
increase the number of options
you have. That's a very

426
00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:59.370
convoluted way of saying that
you need to condition yourself

427
00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:08.880
to making increasingly uncomfortable decisions
and redefine risk. So when

428
00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:10.980
people talk about risk, I
think they're actually talking about

429
00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:13.680
discomfort most of the time
when they say a risk

430
00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:16.410
of discomfort. So they say,
Oh, that's really risky. No,

431
00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:20.730
it's uncertain. Therefore it's uncomfortable
for you. And I define

432
00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:24.870
risk in the four hour
workweek as the potential for

433
00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:29.370
an irreversible negative outcome. Okay.
And when you look at

434
00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:33.360
risk, that way you find
that very few things contain

435
00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:37.740
any risk, whether it's negotiating
with a boss or implementing

436
00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:43.140
an autoresponder or outsourcing your
email, you outsource your email,

437
00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:45.950
you try for a day,
it doesn't work. You cancel

438
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:48.140
you're back to where you
were, right? So there's a

439
00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:52.550
potential, let's say negative outcome,
temporary negative outcome on a

440
00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:54.620
scale of one to 10
of a three or four,

441
00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:58.070
perhaps it doubles your workload
for one day. Whereas the

442
00:23:58.070 --> 00:24:01.730
potential positive outcome that is
semi-permanent could be a nine

443
00:24:01.910 --> 00:24:06.320
or a 10. And once
you start looking at decisions

444
00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:09.650
in those terms and you
take, you make these small

445
00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:13.040
steps and take experiments, and
I use the word experiment

446
00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:16.040
a lot, because the only
reason that I've been able

447
00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:18.230
to do some of the
things that I've done, which

448
00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:21.050
appear outrageous is that I've
built up to them over

449
00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:24.560
time by making S by
conducting small experiments. Hence the

450
00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:27.890
name of the blog is
experiments in lifestyle design, because

451
00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:31.630
almost all of these things
are reversible. Yeah. I liked

452
00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:34.030
the experiments in lifestyle design.
One of the things that

453
00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:36.940
struck me about the blog
when I was poking around,

454
00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:40.420
I didn't expect to find
pictures of before and after

455
00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:43.150
pictures of you working out,
I'm a, I'm a type

456
00:24:43.150 --> 00:24:46.360
one diabetic on an insulin
pump. I'm always trying to

457
00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:49.210
Vista. It sounds silly, but
I'm always trying to gain

458
00:24:49.210 --> 00:24:50.830
weight. Cause as a type
one diabetic, we tend to

459
00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:53.020
just kind of drip weight
off of us. And the

460
00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:56.140
way that you approach this,
this pretty dramatic weight gain

461
00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:59.290
over a pretty short period
of time was very, it

462
00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:01.930
felt very experimental. It felt
like very scientific. It wasn't

463
00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:04.120
necessarily that you knew you
were going to succeed, but

464
00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:06.190
you knew something was going
to happen. You, you shook

465
00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:08.650
things up, you kept track
of it at every point

466
00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:12.970
and made small adjustments as
you went along. Yeah, no,

467
00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:17.230
that's exactly right. And I
ended up gaining 34 pounds

468
00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:20.830
of muscle in four weeks,
but what's, what's more noteworthy

469
00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:24.790
than that is that I
spent two, I had two

470
00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:28.150
workouts per week, each of
30 minutes or less. So

471
00:25:28.150 --> 00:25:30.790
what that means is I
gained 34 pounds of muscle

472
00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:32.770
and lost three pounds of
fat. So I recomposed my

473
00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:37.150
body entirely with four total
hours of workout time in

474
00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:40.510
one month. And part of
the reason I was able

475
00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:44.740
to do that is I
harvest data compulsively. So every

476
00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:46.810
workout I've done for the
last six years, I have

477
00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:50.440
recorded in detail. And so
I can look for example,

478
00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:52.540
at a photo of myself
from three years ago and

479
00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:54.310
I can see the exact
date and say, I want

480
00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:56.890
to look exactly like I
looked, then I can go

481
00:25:56.890 --> 00:26:00.460
back in my workout journal,
repeat four weeks prior to

482
00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:04.330
that photo and look exactly
the same. And it's about,

483
00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:07.420
it's about the intelligent use
of data. That's all it

484
00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:10.660
is. And I think that's
something that, that anyone can

485
00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:13.840
duplicate and you, you don't
have to necessarily create that

486
00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:15.790
data yourself. You can borrow
from other People. See it

487
00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:17.920
now that's huge. Now at
this point, some of my

488
00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:20.380
listeners may have said, well,
what is this? This is

489
00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:23.470
not the typical Scott Hanselman
podcast. It's usually about programming

490
00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:25.480
and development and stuff like
this. But the idea that

491
00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:29.200
there is data out there,
whether it be clickstream data,

492
00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:30.880
how people are moving around
the web, that kind of

493
00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:33.670
stuff that my listeners do
in their everyday job, whether

494
00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:36.340
it's blood sugar information that
I'm storing. Cause I've got

495
00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:39.130
all my blood sugar going
back 12 years, I have

496
00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:43.650
a diet. I've got, you
know, recipes. I, the same

497
00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:48.000
experience. I have blood tests
going back six years and

498
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.400
I can look at diet
and I can say, this

499
00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:53.040
is why my blood sugar
was great for this one

500
00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:55.950
month period, or this is
why it wasn't. And I

501
00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:59.730
can repeat those things. When
recently had a I'm open,

502
00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:01.530
I've been a type one
diabetic for 12 years. I

503
00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:05.190
recently had my very first
non-diabetic blood test where you

504
00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:06.930
could not tell if I
was a type one diabetic

505
00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:09.570
now, to be clear, I'm
on an insulin pump and

506
00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:11.370
it continues. And I checked
my blood sugar 20 times

507
00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:12.930
a day and dah, dah,
dah, dah, dah, dah, but

508
00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:15.870
on paper on this one
blood test, which is now

509
00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:18.960
up on my refrigerator with
the number circled, I'm not

510
00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:24.480
a diabetic. So now I've
got my success, my success,

511
00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:28.050
a point now I just
need to repeat that every

512
00:27:28.050 --> 00:27:31.880
month of my life until
I'm dead. Right? And I

513
00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:38.900
think that one important point
to mention is that people

514
00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:43.640
who are very analytical and
logical in one area of

515
00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:47.750
their lives, like programming are
very often completely neglectful of

516
00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:50.690
data and other areas. So
you'll have someone who will

517
00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:55.340
sit down and clean up
spaghetti code for 20 hours

518
00:27:56.180 --> 00:28:00.500
as just a logical machine,
streamlining it. And then, and

519
00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:02.330
then they'll go into the
gym and they'll pick up

520
00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:05.330
the latest issue of muscle
and fitness was, which says,

521
00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:07.340
you know how to turn
your calves into cows on

522
00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:11.390
the cover. And they'll do
three sets of 15 because

523
00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:13.700
the big guy taking steroids
says do three sets of

524
00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:16.520
15, but they never stop
to ask themselves why three

525
00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:19.070
sets in, why 15? Why
not? Four sets of 12?

526
00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:23.360
Why not? 20 sets of
two and the same logical

527
00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:26.660
mech, the same logical tools,
the critical thinking and lateral

528
00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:29.420
thinking tools that they apply
in one area should be

529
00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:32.180
in, can be applied in
all of those areas. This

530
00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:33.680
is very interesting. A lot
of the programmers, I know,

531
00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:36.350
spend a lot of their
analytical power analyzing two things,

532
00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:40.280
their financial life and their
programming life. But very often

533
00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:42.710
they spend a little time
on things like diet, personal

534
00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:46.580
happiness, free time, you know,
allocation of free time, what

535
00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:48.680
they ultimately want to do
with their life, how they

536
00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:51.590
want to spend their time.
You are working fewer hours

537
00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:53.540
a week. I assume you're
filling the rest of your

538
00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:57.610
time with things that you
enjoy. Yeah, absolutely. And the

539
00:28:57.620 --> 00:29:02.600
challenge is taking something that's
not obviously a binary or

540
00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:05.930
a numerical like finance or
programming and converting it into

541
00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:07.970
numbers. That's all you have
to do. That's the most

542
00:29:07.970 --> 00:29:11.840
time consuming step once you
do that, it's easy. And

543
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:15.140
I do spend my time
doing things that either, either

544
00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:18.320
that I enjoy or that
I derive benefit or fulfillment

545
00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:21.260
from. So I don't necessarily
enjoy going to the kickboxing

546
00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:24.170
gym and getting punched in
the head. But I find

547
00:29:24.170 --> 00:29:29.420
that the, the, the exercise,
so to speak the conditioning

548
00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:31.580
effect of that has a
positive carry over to other

549
00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:34.070
areas. So I find it
redeeming. I find it valuable.

550
00:29:34.130 --> 00:29:37.100
It may not be enjoyable
in the laying on your

551
00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:39.320
stomach, on a beach, getting
a massage sense of the

552
00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:46.350
word, but on level it's,
it's, it's valuable. And I

553
00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:49.660
think that if, once you
take these, these very fuzzy

554
00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:53.620
qualitative terms, that people don't
stop to define like success,

555
00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:56.470
happiness. And if you can't
define them, you scrap them.

556
00:29:56.590 --> 00:29:59.050
It's a very simple solution.
And I want it to

557
00:29:59.050 --> 00:30:01.720
be a penciler and a
comic book penciler for about

558
00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:04.900
10 years and actually was
an illustrator for a period

559
00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:09.220
of time and had the
same graphic editor position as

560
00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:11.200
Jim Lee did, Jim Lee
used to be a very

561
00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:17.770
famous penciler and one of
the, the mandates or, or

562
00:30:18.790 --> 00:30:21.550
principles that a lot of
pencils use and anchors and

563
00:30:21.550 --> 00:30:23.950
comic books is when in
doubt black it out. And

564
00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:25.870
I think that if you
apply that to most of

565
00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:29.050
your life, as opposed to
trying to simply reorganize everything,

566
00:30:29.050 --> 00:30:33.180
you can get very, very
far, very, very fast. I

567
00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:34.980
really appreciate you taking the
time to sit down with

568
00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:38.160
me. The book is the
four hour workweek and the

569
00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:41.100
blog is also the four
hour workweek.com. It's just a,

570
00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:44.730
Either four hour workweek.com or
the four hour workweek.com. And

571
00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:47.460
then I'll look straight to
your blog there. Cool. Thanks

572
00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:49.140
a lot. And this has
been another episode of Hansel

573
00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:55.380
minutes. We'll see you again
next week. <inaudible>.
