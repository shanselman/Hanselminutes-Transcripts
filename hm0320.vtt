episode, Scott talks with Phil

9
00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:00.140
hack and Tim Clem about
developing GitHub for windows. Hi,

10
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.820
this is Scott Hanselman and
this is another episode of

11
00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.630
Hansel minutes. And today big
announcement, big, exciting stuff. Phil

12
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.230
hack is back from get
hub. He's a quitter. He

13
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.710
left Microsoft. He abandoned me,
abandon his team, but he

14
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.240
went off. He did something
amazing and we'd worked for

15
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.700
get hub and he's brought
his friend, Tim Clem, along,

16
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.000
Phil, what did you do?
What did you make? What

17
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.310
did you bring me? So
We've been teasing you about

18
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.020
being acquitted. Anytime we see
you, we just have to

19
00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.620
like cough, quitter. What? An
introduction. No, no. In all

20
00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.780
seriousness though, we, we love
you and we know you're

21
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.130
still a big, big part
of the community and you're

22
00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.040
doing amazing stuff. So you
and Tim and team have

23
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.360
brought what to share. So
we've brought get hub for

24
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.450
windows. I have no musical
cue. I have no, but

25
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.750
it happened in my mind
though, in my brain, I

26
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.330
was like gearing up for
windows, windows, windows, echo, echo

27
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:59.630
echo. Yes, yes, yes. A
client application for interacting with

28
00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.620
get hub as well as
a gate client. And the

29
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.390
nice thing about it, even
if you don't care for

30
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.450
a good hub and just
need a gay client, it

31
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.860
installs everything that I'd like
to scratch that because why

32
00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.150
would anyone not care about
getting it? Let me roll

33
00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.000
back. Well, hang on. You
want to seriously roll back?

34
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.950
Cause we don't really, I
don't roll back on the

35
00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.830
show. Like even as, even
as I'm saying this right

36
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.420
now, I'm fully not intending
to roll this back. This

37
00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.670
is the stuff of legend.
You're overthinking it. My friend.

38
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.220
Yeah. I get up for
windows Because I just recorded

39
00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.350
another podcast where they're like,
Oh yeah, you can just

40
00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.410
roll it back. Just pause.
And then it, See now

41
00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.210
you're now you're making me
feel. I thought I had

42
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.520
an exclusive and now you're
making me feel on special.

43
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.950
No, I'm just saying, hanging
out with Galloway or, you

44
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.770
know, that troubles. It was
hurting code guys. Okay. So,

45
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.200
but to be clear when
you install it, it makes

46
00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.700
everything just happen. Yeah, exactly.
Yeah. This is, I mean,

47
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.490
it's your one stop shop
for get on windows as

48
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.970
well as kind of seamless
interactivity with GitHub. So you

49
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.150
basically shouldn't need to do
anything other than run, set

50
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.710
up that exi In the
past. I've got I've, you

51
00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.170
know, I go up and
I Google and I've with

52
00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.450
being and I find get,
and I download like M

53
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.970
SIS get, and I don't
know what that means. And

54
00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.920
then it asks me scary
questions. Like, do you want

55
00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.490
me to like either a
destroy your path B destroy

56
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.460
your system or C probably
not work at all. I

57
00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.980
never know which one to
pick. And then I push

58
00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.080
it and then it gives
me like Cygwin and then

59
00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.540
I'm in some kind of
strange land and I've never

60
00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.020
quite felt like I integrated
get into my life. And

61
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.330
then I tried posh get
from Keith lb and we

62
00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.340
like worked on that and
made it work in PowerPoint

63
00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.920
shell, which was kind of
cool, but I never really

64
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.470
felt like get belonged here.
Like I felt like get

65
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.740
didn't want to be on
windows. And I think that's

66
00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.460
actually a really common experience.
Like the majority of windows

67
00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:01.380
developers it's, it's like going
into the, you know, the

68
00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.170
woods it's like Trek it
up. The Amazon you're in

69
00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.860
a foreign land. You type
in some in Canton, Ken,

70
00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.840
Ken patient into a command
prompt. And all of a

71
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.990
sudden you're in a text
editor where, you know, letters,

72
00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.600
don't actually tech type text
in it. And you're like,

73
00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.270
Oh my God, close the
window. This is, you know,

74
00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:20.910
I give up like, this
is not the system for

75
00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.760
me. And so what we've
tried to do is really

76
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.490
remove a lot of that
barrier in, you know, you

77
00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.210
don't need to pick paths
being overwritten and whether you

78
00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.760
want line feeds or carriage
returns in line feeds on

79
00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.460
the end of your lines
and your environment, you just

80
00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.570
need to install a single
utility. It does come with

81
00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.770
a full working version of
emphasis get. And so if

82
00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.510
you need to get down
on that level, you absolutely

83
00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.240
can. But for, you know,
the 90% of people who

84
00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.360
are doing kind of basic
versioning tasks and pushing and

85
00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.660
pulling repositories from get hub,
you probably never have to

86
00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.270
type an up to skit
command again in your life

87
00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.810
Seriously. And now the one
that I've been beta testing

88
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.330
is a, is click once,
is it remaining click once

89
00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.720
It will, for the initial
release, we have some, some

90
00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.570
plans, but for version one,
that we're going to distribute

91
00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.790
it with click ones. So
that means that, you know,

92
00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.800
I'll go up there, I'll
push set up once. It'll

93
00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.560
be like, I dunno, what
is it like 10 megs

94
00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.510
and very small. It it's
actually fairly good because we

95
00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.420
actually pack get, we bundle,
get inside the app as

96
00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.720
well. So I think it's
30 or 40 Meg download,

97
00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.600
but you have a full
working installation of, of get

98
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.850
included in that I don't
need to maintain that installation

99
00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.100
of get like You do
not that all comes with

100
00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.810
it. And I think one
of the best parts that

101
00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:37.440
we've done is just the,
the updates are really Chrome

102
00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.520
style seamless. You basically get
notified when an update has

103
00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.580
already downloaded and installed on
your computer. And that update

104
00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.700
might include a new version
of get Really. And then

105
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.760
you just unpack get into
some special secret place. And

106
00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.110
I don't have to think
about it. You don't have

107
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:53.790
to think about it. I
already have a version of

108
00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:57.060
get on my system, Which
you can continue to use

109
00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.720
and, and our get really
lives in its own sandbox.

110
00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.690
And so we, we write
a shortcut out that you

111
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:05.090
could launch to kind of
pull up, get in a

112
00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:08.600
shell of your choosing a
PowerShell or the traditional command

113
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.730
prompt, or even get bash.
If you really are in

114
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:14.000
love with the eye. And
that tool set, I use

115
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.460
console too. So I type
in my kind of custom

116
00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.890
thing and that ends up
being what I launched. And

117
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:21.860
it pulls up in the
context of whatever repository you're

118
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.590
looking at in the application.
So if I'm, you know,

119
00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.590
checking out a new get
gallery, and I want to

120
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:30.230
make a contribution, I can
pull up a PowerShell instance

121
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:33.320
with posh, get loaded up
right within the, you know,

122
00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.950
the path loaded of that
repo. So I'm going to

123
00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:38.320
try something here and I
hope this is okay if

124
00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.020
I go here and I
say, get clone, but I'm

125
00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:42.490
doing this on the command
line. I said, I'm going

126
00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:46.570
to pull from code Plex,
which now supports get what

127
00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:48.190
will happen to get up
for windows. And what's the

128
00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:51.970
relationship between like get stuff
from my company versus get

129
00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:55.540
stuff from copex versus GetSet
from GitHub all get, but

130
00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.330
not all from the same
place. Well, once you've climbed

131
00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:01.120
it locally, you can drag
it into a get hub

132
00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.460
for windows and you'll be
able to use, get hub

133
00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:07.510
for windows as a good
client for that repository. You'll

134
00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:09.610
miss out on some of
the benefits of being able

135
00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:15.510
to clone directly from that,
that repo remote hosts. That's

136
00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:17.680
some of the things that
you get with GitHub, but

137
00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.980
yeah, you can, what happens
is you'll need to make

138
00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:25.900
sure you call in the
HTTPS URL, which for complex,

139
00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:27.720
I think that's the only
one they offer, right. It

140
00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:30.250
bucket offers both. And then
when you navigate to your

141
00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:32.590
drag it into, get her
for windows and then try

142
00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:35.800
to navigate, okay. And now
go and navigate to it.

143
00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:40.210
There's the little arrow, openness,
this repo login required. Yep.

144
00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.630
So now you enter your
credentials for code Plex there

145
00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:46.690
and it actually says COVID
flex right there. Yeah. We'll

146
00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:49.240
look at that. Yep. And
we'll cash it for you.

147
00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:52.210
And what's nice is if
you're using our prompt or

148
00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:55.900
shell, or if you use
the app, now you won't

149
00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:58.240
have to reenter your username
and password every time you

150
00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:01.060
make a commit and push
and push it up. So

151
00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:04.360
this is nice. I'm looking
at Luan. Who's one of

152
00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:08.020
our engineers. Who's just checked
something in to asp.net. I've

153
00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:10.810
got a diff, I've got
old new, I've got line

154
00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:15.250
numbers. I've got, I can
scroll around and I can

155
00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:18.490
see their faces. How do
I, how do you know

156
00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:22.750
what they look like? So
we use Across GitHub, we

157
00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:27.310
use Gravatar as a way
to show faces next to

158
00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.550
people's users on GitHub. And
it's all keyed off of

159
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:34.480
an email address. So even
for something like code Plex,

160
00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.790
you know, you are putting
your email address in those

161
00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:38.890
commits. And as long as
you've signed up for a

162
00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:42.100
Gravatar with that email address,
then we're able to display

163
00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:44.680
it in the app. Very
cool. Very cool. I like

164
00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:47.140
that. It's nice that, that
I can have all of

165
00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:51.820
my good stuff, both get
hub local. And at, at

166
00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:57.810
Coplex all in one place,
it seems the, the real

167
00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:00.030
depth is once you get
past that first screen and

168
00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:04.140
you dig into our reproach
or repo. Absolutely. Like I

169
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:06.870
initially didn't realize that, that
there was much more beyond

170
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:08.580
kind of this browser. I
was saying, there's a Mark

171
00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:09.840
Dennett. And then I clicked
on it and I was

172
00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.670
like, Oh, look at all
this stuff. And then you

173
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:14.720
can really start digging in.
Yup. And you can create

174
00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:19.310
branches, manage branches, delete branches,
merge branches. So there's a

175
00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:23.180
lot, a lot you can
do. Well, there's this notion

176
00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:25.160
of sinking. Every time I
move around, like for example,

177
00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:30.050
I just clicked from master
to a V2 release candidate

178
00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:34.280
branch, and there's little subtle
things that sinking. And then

179
00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.740
I switched back and it
says sinking again. What is

180
00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:38.420
the notion of sinking? And
what does that, what does

181
00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:42.050
that mean to, to the
average, Joe, who's not familiar

182
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:48.860
with getting get hub. And
so, so what we're doing

183
00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:52.070
is we're checking the remote
URL to see if there's

184
00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:54.620
any new commits that you
might want to pull down

185
00:09:54.920 --> 00:10:01.760
locally, get like material like
a unlike subversion or TFS

186
00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:05.930
get is a distributed version
control system. So you have

187
00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:09.800
the entire repository history locally
on your machine, and you

188
00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:13.670
can make a commits and
do work all locally, branch,

189
00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:16.220
whatever you want. And then
at some point, though, you're

190
00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:18.680
probably going to want to
share those changes with other

191
00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:22.520
people. And, and that's where
we're sinking can come in.

192
00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:27.200
If you've made some local
commits, you'll see that the

193
00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:30.560
sync button will light up
and be enabled so that

194
00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.690
you can click on it
and push those commits slope

195
00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.870
up to the server. And
likewise, if there's commits on

196
00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:37.880
the server that you don't
have, you can click the

197
00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:40.670
button and it'll pull them
down. And if you have

198
00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:44.450
commits local and commits on
the server will handle that

199
00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:47.450
situation too. When you, when
you clicks sync, we're going

200
00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:50.840
to put the server and
your local repository in the

201
00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:54.710
same state. Well, I just
clicked revert, commit to one

202
00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:56.840
of the things. And then
I can see here unsync

203
00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:59.870
commence commits and then history.
And then if I hit

204
00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:01.910
sync, it would go up
and probably fail. Cause I

205
00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:04.820
don't have permission to go
directly to, to master. Could

206
00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:07.880
I make pull requests directly
from here as well? You

207
00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:11.240
cannot, but for many commit
you can go directly to

208
00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:14.870
GitHub. If, if you're a
repository is hosted on get

209
00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:17.210
hub. And I think it's
key to remember, at least

210
00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:20.960
for this initial version, we're
really targeting get hub.com as

211
00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:23.540
the place to hold your
repository. So you won't see

212
00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:25.670
a lot of those things
if you're using a code

213
00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:28.670
flexor a bit. Okay. So
I'll switch back over to

214
00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:30.860
some of the code 52
guys, if you check out

215
00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:33.170
code 50 two.org, these are
the guys that are doing

216
00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:36.080
a different open source project
every week, and they're all

217
00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:39.320
hosted on GitHub. I can
go up there and see

218
00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:41.420
what they're doing. And this
has been actually really great

219
00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:44.420
for me to learn more
about code. It's such a

220
00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:47.750
nice code browser and the
code browser is nice on

221
00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:50.960
GitHub on the website, but
frankly, once you've used GitHub

222
00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:55.270
for windows, a long enough
moving around with the cursor

223
00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:57.400
is faster. You know what
I'm saying? Like I'm looking

224
00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:00.010
here at history, I've got
a 30 inch monitor. I've

225
00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:04.150
got a beautiful, you know,
Metro looking app here, which

226
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:05.590
is get up to windows.
And then on the right

227
00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:09.280
hand side, I'm just cursing
up and down, looking at

228
00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:12.640
the different check-ins and you
do have infinite scroll. And

229
00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.920
what's nice about this is
that I can move faster.

230
00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:16.690
So it's nice that we
can do so many things

231
00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:21.220
with HTML five, but honestly,
apps like this. Remind me

232
00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:22.840
why we have a client
app in the first place.

233
00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:25.810
If you know what I'm
saying. Absolutely. Did you, did

234
00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:27.520
you guys ever have discussions
like that? Did you ever

235
00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:29.620
say to yourselves, well, maybe
we'll just not do a

236
00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:32.650
windows client. We'll just make
a super amazing web page

237
00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:35.460
that will do what we
needed to do. I, you

238
00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:38.370
know, there's something really essential
still about, you know, the

239
00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:41.850
development and the design and
kind of that creative aspect

240
00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:44.610
happening locally still. And a
lot of people that are

241
00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:48.060
attempting to do, you know,
code editing and IDs in

242
00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:50.790
the browser. And in many
ways, I still think that

243
00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:54.840
people want to like unplug
and have very rich, native,

244
00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:58.380
responsive tools. I mean, all
of our development tools across

245
00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:02.040
platforms that we use are
native. I mean, it's, that

246
00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:04.680
is the experience that you
come to love and to

247
00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:07.890
edit code in a web
browser is maybe convenient sometimes,

248
00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:10.860
but ultimately, you know, I
prefer that the native tools

249
00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:13.650
come into this, you know,
they're hooked up to the

250
00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:16.230
web and they have a
paradigm of sync. And so

251
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:18.480
you don't need to worry
about having the latest changes

252
00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.310
of the latest version, but
you get, you know, all

253
00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:22.890
this nice making use of
your big screen and your

254
00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:25.950
graphics card and, you know,
beautifully rendering text and that

255
00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:28.320
kind of stuff. So it
sounds like you're not bought

256
00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:32.430
into the HTML will be
the thing for all applications

257
00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:34.500
and all problems can be
solved. You know, I think

258
00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:36.750
they'll come in the middle.
I think, you know, you

259
00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:39.180
finding that the web is
trying to pull in more

260
00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:41.760
and more rich client functionality,
but they can only do

261
00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:44.880
so in a way that's
lowest common denominator. It goes

262
00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:48.300
against all platforms and the
native apps are starting to

263
00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:50.880
become more and more like
the web and that they're

264
00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:54.360
plugged into web services and
rest API APIs and, you

265
00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:57.120
know, your settings sync to
new machines without having to

266
00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:59.850
tell them anything other than
your username and password. And

267
00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:02.790
so sooner or later, I
won't, you know, I'll, I

268
00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:05.280
could even like tear a
tab out of, you know,

269
00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:08.100
Chrome and all of a
sudden that is actually a

270
00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:10.890
rich native app on my
machine. That's thinking, and then

271
00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:14.730
we'll work on the airplane
without wifi. Nice, nice actually,

272
00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:17.160
to speak to that, I'm
sitting here looking at my

273
00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.530
own GitHub repository and I've
got something that I worked

274
00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:22.050
on my laptop that I
don't have on my big

275
00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:24.660
desktop that we're talking on
right here. And I'm going

276
00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:27.420
to visit that. It's a,
a visual studio extension that

277
00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:29.820
I wrote, and there's a
button here next to the

278
00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:32.250
little thing that says, download
this repository is a zip

279
00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:35.940
file. It says clone in
windows, and I'm actually running

280
00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:39.030
Google Chrome here. So I'm
not running, I don't have

281
00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:41.640
any active X controls or
anything. I hover over that.

282
00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:45.210
It says GitHub windows, colon
slash slash not HTTP slash

283
00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:47.880
slash. I click on that.
And it says, do you

284
00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:49.920
want to launch applications? And
I say, yes. And then

285
00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:52.970
suddenly it actually brings that
Down. I see the folder

286
00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:56.930
just appeared. It's coming down
asynchronously. It's just shown up

287
00:14:57.470 --> 00:15:01.220
and an ex even reused
the instance of GitHub for

288
00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:03.080
windows. I already had it.
Didn't launch a new one.

289
00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:06.350
There you go. That's a
pretty slick interaction right there.

290
00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:08.690
So, and you have to
compare that to, you know,

291
00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:11.840
what, what do we try
to teach people otherwise, you

292
00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:14.930
know, maybe a year ago
doing that on windows would

293
00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:17.930
involve, you know, walking through
those dialogues and emphasis, get

294
00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:19.820
trying to understand whether your
path is going to get

295
00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:23.330
Borks and then learning how
to set up SSH keys

296
00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:27.470
and upload them to get
hub, and then pulling out

297
00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:31.280
a command prompt and figuring
out the proper way to

298
00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:34.310
tell, get to pull a
repository locally. So I think,

299
00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:36.430
you know, that right there
is kind of the, the

300
00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:39.770
biggest change that I hope
that we're making in the,

301
00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:42.380
in the ecosystem in terms
of just making it easier

302
00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:46.400
to check out other people's
code and potentially contribute to

303
00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:49.390
it. Yeah. I was just
today, I was working on

304
00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:54.850
updating our help docs for
the launch and we have

305
00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:56.560
a page, you know, how
to get, get set up

306
00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:58.930
for windows. And it's fairly
long, quite a few steps.

307
00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:01.420
And I was like, wow,
I can pretty much take

308
00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:05.320
all of this market deleted
one line that says, click

309
00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:09.310
this link and you are
done. And so, you know,

310
00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:15.730
it's a significant amount of
simplification of getting it set

311
00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:19.150
up and hopefully it just
lowers the barrier of entry

312
00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:23.440
to getting contributing to other
projects like, like Tim was

313
00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:26.710
saying, What will users of
like tortoise get? And some

314
00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:29.290
of these other Explorer type
things that have kind of

315
00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:33.310
cobbled together tools that aren't
necessarily as polished visually, but

316
00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:35.980
maybe more functionally polished. Are
they gonna, you think that

317
00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:37.420
they're going to switch to
get up for windows or

318
00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:39.700
they're just going to find
that they'll use GitHub for

319
00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:42.550
windows for 80 90% of
what they're doing. And then

320
00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:44.800
if they need something super
advanced, they'll hop into another

321
00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:48.100
alternate tool. You know, I
expect people to use a

322
00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:51.520
hybrid of tools. Our target
was really to bring in

323
00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:55.330
people who were basically completely
turned off by having to

324
00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:58.330
install a command line utility
to use or what our

325
00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:00.640
website. And so we just,
we kind of want to

326
00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:03.970
like extend the invitation to
be part of this open

327
00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:06.820
source thing, or even your
private source collaboration on get

328
00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:09.700
hub. But you know, a
lot of those tools in

329
00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:12.910
many ways still required to
go read the gift documentation,

330
00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:14.470
you know, you right. Click
and you get a list

331
00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:18.850
of every get command, revert,
reset, you know, soft, mixed

332
00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:21.160
har you know, you still
have to go understand what

333
00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:24.130
do all my 17 menu
options. What does that actually

334
00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:28.240
going to do to my
repository? Yup. Yeah. And so

335
00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:31.870
I've found that I, I
use both the, the command

336
00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:35.170
shell PowerShell with posh kit
and the good hub for

337
00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:38.950
windows application in a kind
of mixed workflow workflow because

338
00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:41.950
the guitar for windows app
doesn't support some of the

339
00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:43.570
advanced things that I like
to do once in a

340
00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:47.590
while. Like if I want
to do a, a patch

341
00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:52.650
commit where I only adding
specific lines of certain files

342
00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:55.380
to the index. Right, right.
That's the kind of thing

343
00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:59.220
that most people don't care.
Maybe I shouldn't, but I

344
00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:01.350
do sometimes. And so, you
know, I'll drop to the

345
00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:04.680
command line to do that,
but, you know, getting for

346
00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:10.620
windows has certain niceties. For
example, when you're edit, entering

347
00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:12.990
a commit message, it has
a feel for sort of

348
00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:16.410
the, so if you're unfamiliar
with the get commit message,

349
00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:19.110
it's really just a one
block attacks, but there's a

350
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:22.170
convention. If you, the first
line followed by a new

351
00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:26.070
line, followed by a description,
right? So title new line

352
00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:29.400
description, and the title really
should only be a certain

353
00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:31.710
number of characters. If you
type more than that number

354
00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:35.160
of characters, you'll notice on
GitHub that it starts to

355
00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:39.000
bleed into the description, but
what we've done in get

356
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.240
her for windows. And I
don't know I'm looking at

357
00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:43.100
it right now. I've got
an uncommitted changes and it

358
00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:45.920
says, get it messaged required.
So I'm typing. So keep

359
00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:49.510
typing. And eventually it turns
gray. Yeah. That's characters turned

360
00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:52.160
gray. And what that's telling
you is that everything that's

361
00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:55.190
gray is sort of too
long for the nice looking

362
00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:59.450
single line description, and you're
free to commit it that

363
00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:02.300
way, but it's kind of
a hint to say, you

364
00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:05.450
know, maybe you want to
shorten the one liner and

365
00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:09.260
write something in the description
and create a nice, get

366
00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:12.170
commit message. Well, I've just
made while we were talking

367
00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:15.890
here and Unsane says unsync
to commit and it's garbage.

368
00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:18.380
Basically I reverted something and
I've just kind of slept

369
00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:22.640
the keyboard. I don't want
to do that. There you

370
00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:26.840
go. You can roll back.
So they're able to click

371
00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:29.150
and I would say roll
back to this commit. Yup.

372
00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:30.920
And I go back to,
so now, Oh, and it

373
00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.200
says no committed changes and
I'm back to where it

374
00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:35.060
was. So I made a
mistake and I put it

375
00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:36.770
right back where it was.
And I think that's a

376
00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:38.660
very hard thing for people
to figure it out, how

377
00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:41.180
to do it and get
mainly because the, you know,

378
00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:45.680
it's, the terminology is confusing.
You have reverts and resets

379
00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:50.050
and, you know, various command
line switches that drastically changed

380
00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:52.580
the behavior of the command.
And so we really simplified

381
00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:55.370
it into two things. A
re a revert is actually

382
00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:58.250
a new commit. That is
exactly the opposite of the

383
00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:00.680
commit you're reverting. So you
think of all the dispatch

384
00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:03.530
that you added that is
like the inverse, you know,

385
00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:07.280
the, the opposite patch applied,
what should, what should take

386
00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:09.650
those changes out of the
code base? And then a

387
00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:13.730
rollback is literally like, take
all those changes and pull

388
00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:16.100
that commit off the top
of the stack, but we

389
00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:19.070
leave those changes dirty in
your working directory. So you're

390
00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:22.250
free to fully delete them.
Or maybe you made a

391
00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:25.490
mistake and you just need
to update a file or

392
00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:27.500
delete a file or, or
add something else in there

393
00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:29.990
that you forgot and then
make another commit, which will

394
00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:31.280
then add that to the
top of the way. Yeah.

395
00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:33.170
You can, you can right.
Click on those files in

396
00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:36.650
the file list, the changes
and discard the changes. Yeah.

397
00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:38.180
Because if I back up,
like I'm looking here, the

398
00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:41.240
asp.net, I back up two
days ago and I say,

399
00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:44.420
roll back to this commit.
Now it says I have

400
00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:48.430
uncommitted changes. So I backed
up, but I, those Changes

401
00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:51.040
are ready to be committed.
And what we're doing there

402
00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:53.970
is we just, We don't,
we're not throwing away any

403
00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:56.310
of that work. We're basically
bringing you back to that

404
00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:59.700
state right before you would
have made the next set

405
00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:03.630
of commits. Interesting. Interesting. Yeah.
So that way you can

406
00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:06.090
do a slight and then
to it, or you can

407
00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:09.690
go ahead and right. Click
and discard those changes. And

408
00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:11.940
so, yeah, I really liked
the fact that we don't

409
00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:15.540
discard that stuff automatically. I
wanna dig a little bit

410
00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:16.890
into a couple of things
that I thought that were

411
00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:20.730
particularly interesting here, because someone
might just say, okay, lovely.

412
00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:23.400
You know, this is like
Phil and Hanselman together again,

413
00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:26.010
or new friend, Tim, and
we're doing an advertisement for

414
00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:28.980
forget hub for windows, but
let's dig into this because

415
00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:30.840
there's two things I think
you did that were significant.

416
00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:33.600
When you say, when I
click and say, I can,

417
00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:35.580
or I can click on
a little gear here and

418
00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:38.670
say, open-end command prompt, but
what's significant to me about

419
00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:43.440
that is if you go
into your settings, here are

420
00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:46.170
your options. Here. It is
default shell. This is the

421
00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:49.620
options for get hub for
windows. It says CMD, what

422
00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:52.410
I like to call dos,
even though it's not CMDA

423
00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:56.610
XC get bash PowerShell or
customs, you actually have four

424
00:21:56.610 --> 00:21:59.520
different choices. So you've got
an advanced option here that

425
00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:03.150
says I can pick the
shell that I want, but

426
00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:05.550
there's a little icon with
a picture of your ma

427
00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:08.100
or your, your Octa, Casey.
It was it called Okta

428
00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:10.710
cat. There you go. You
got it. The Octocat it

429
00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:13.830
says get shell. So depending
on which shall I pick,

430
00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:16.110
that's what they get shell
becomes. If I want to

431
00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:18.690
use console too, and I
double click on get shell,

432
00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:21.690
it will be the get
shell, correct? Yep. That's what

433
00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:23.940
Tim and I have set
up. Yeah. Yeah. You do.

434
00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:26.280
You use console and you're
using console too with PowerShell.

435
00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:30.720
Yes. Okay. And then when
you use PowerShell, you partnered

436
00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:34.440
up didn't you to make
PowerShell better forget. Absolutely. Yeah.

437
00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:38.790
Yeah. Take advantage of one
major thing in particular. And

438
00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:43.890
that's Keith Falvey's posh kit,
which really changes your experience

439
00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:45.840
on the command line in
terms of interacting with a

440
00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:48.630
get repository and kind of
understanding the current state and

441
00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:52.260
status. Yeah. We use quite
a bit of open source

442
00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:55.020
in this project, which was
a lot of fun. Was

443
00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:56.790
that difficult. Like I know
that when we did this

444
00:22:56.790 --> 00:23:00.780
at Microsoft, there's there's patent
searches and there's asking bosses

445
00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:03.050
and stuff. I assume that
you guys just let you

446
00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:05.580
just like give, get a
cigar and you just say,

447
00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:07.470
yeah, we're going to use
this. Yeah. Was there a

448
00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:09.510
lawyer involved at any point
or was it really just

449
00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:13.320
like over beers? W there
was no low area. Everything

450
00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:17.450
was over beers. We've tried
to, everyone is credited in,

451
00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:21.330
in the app. If someone
really feels strongly that we've

452
00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:24.390
infringed, we will go drink
beer with someone else and

453
00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:27.450
use their open source project.
So, yeah, But we've tried,

454
00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:30.180
we've tried hard to comply
with the, you know, with

455
00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:32.250
the terms of the licenses,
right? These are all open

456
00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:35.520
source licenses. So it's not
really that hard to use

457
00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:39.690
them. Yeah. Everything we've used
has, Has an explicit opensource

458
00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:42.840
license. Some of them are
on GitHub. I think a

459
00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:45.800
couple of them are on
COVID Plex. And so we've

460
00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:48.830
pulled Those into the, in
the credits of the application.

461
00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:51.310
So when you found open
source, that is, that wants

462
00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:53.830
to be used. You used
it. Absolutely. In fact, if

463
00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:56.950
you go into the options
menu, you should see from

464
00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:59.470
the main dashboard, you should
see a credit option and

465
00:23:59.470 --> 00:24:01.690
you can push on that
and you can see all

466
00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:05.260
the various projects that we've
credited. Correct. One of the

467
00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:07.120
things I'm noticing too, is
I move around. Like, for

468
00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:09.460
example, I'm doing a sync
right now off, over one

469
00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:12.520
place, but I'm still able
to move around the thing

470
00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:14.830
hasn't locked up at all.
It hasn't when I say

471
00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:17.080
locked up, I don't mean
like in a crashed way,

472
00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:19.420
but I mean, in a,
it hasn't made me wait

473
00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:21.970
for anything. It seems asynchronous
and pretty much everything that's

474
00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:28.210
doing. Absolutely. That smells like
Paul bets. Yeah. That is

475
00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:32.470
definitely his sense. And which
is the tool of Paul's

476
00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:33.850
that you use. I talked
to him about this a

477
00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:35.440
while back, but I don't
want to necessarily lead the

478
00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:40.570
interview too far, Re reactive
UI, which is a built

479
00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:43.570
a UI framework for WPF
that builds on top of

480
00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:51.400
reactive extensions. You get that@reactiveui.net,
the single page homepage for

481
00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:54.220
reactive UI that I be
rated Paul and to making,

482
00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:58.900
when I told them this
is amazing, where's your homepage.

483
00:24:58.910 --> 00:25:00.280
I don't have one. So
you need to make a

484
00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:03.970
homepage right now. And he
made this great one. And

485
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.250
you actually feel, I've seen
you tweet a number of

486
00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:08.500
times that it's completely changed
the way that you thought

487
00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:13.060
about UI. Oh yeah, yeah,
yeah, definitely. It's all about

488
00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:17.410
UI and about how, how
to do async and, you

489
00:25:17.410 --> 00:25:19.030
know, it's really gotten me
kind of in love with

490
00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:25.840
declarative functional programming and it
it's so impressed. You know,

491
00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:28.090
what I really love about
it is it impressed a

492
00:25:28.090 --> 00:25:30.190
lot of the guys, other
guys that get hub who

493
00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:32.770
are working on the Mac
app so much that they

494
00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:37.240
built reactive cocoa. Cause I,
yeah. So, and they published,

495
00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:40.360
it's published on GitHub now.
So it's an open source

496
00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:46.690
project that brings basically the
same reactive paradigm to objective

497
00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:51.820
C developers for the Macko
S Wow. That's very exciting.

498
00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:54.820
They're blocked. They're blocked. Syntax
is a little ugly, but

499
00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:58.930
yeah, That's just the magic
of objective C I'm sorry.

500
00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:01.540
Yeah, it looks ugly, but
at least they can do

501
00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:04.960
some of the same kind
of, you know, beautiful interactions

502
00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:08.290
in a way ugly language.
And you did this, so

503
00:26:08.290 --> 00:26:11.110
you did this happen. WPF,
of course, how has been

504
00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:12.790
that experience? And I know
that a lot of people

505
00:26:12.790 --> 00:26:16.300
felt that WPF had a
rough start and the fonts

506
00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:19.660
were really blurry, but ever
since kind of Metro twit

507
00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:21.430
kind of came out and
paved the way to make

508
00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:23.980
it make a, a good
looking application. I'm seeing more

509
00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:27.340
and more WPF apps that
don't suck. This seems to

510
00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:30.550
be no, I mean, it's
fast. It paints quickly. It's

511
00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:34.580
beautiful. It's clear the fonts
look sharp. Oh, I'll let

512
00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:36.270
Tim go first on this.
And then I'll tell you

513
00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:38.740
what's good. What's bad. I
mean, I think we've had

514
00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:43.000
a, generally a really positive
experience with WPF and definitely,

515
00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:45.540
you know, we work in
a really Cross-platform environment. And

516
00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:48.930
so it's fun to compare
notes with the iOS guys

517
00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:52.770
and the web guys about
how they're solving layout and

518
00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:55.500
transparency problems and doing animations
and those kinds of things.

519
00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:58.740
And at the end of
the day, like WPF kind

520
00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:00.150
of blows a lot of
those things out of the

521
00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:04.260
water in terms of the
tool set around building interfaces

522
00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:07.170
and the design time environment.
And then even just having

523
00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:10.410
a version of will format
of our interfaces. I mean,

524
00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:13.080
if you're on, if you're
doing iOS development, you got

525
00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:17.220
these basically nib files, which
are don't show anything on

526
00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:19.410
get hub. You can't tell
when anybody's moved a button

527
00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:22.710
around or change the color
somewhere. And so I think

528
00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:25.290
from that aspect, we really
had a very, very, very

529
00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:28.590
positive experience with WPF. And
it's at this point, you

530
00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:32.640
know, version four things are
fairly mature. The text blurriness,

531
00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:35.430
I think, got ironed out
when visual studio started adopting

532
00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:39.630
more WPF, there are certainly
at SCWorks in some corner

533
00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:43.650
things and certain elements, which
still kind of, I see,

534
00:27:43.650 --> 00:27:47.460
and drive me nuts in
the application, but it, in

535
00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:50.460
general it is, it is
a beautimous framework to work

536
00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:54.060
in. And I think maybe
the biggest stamp of approval

537
00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:56.070
was, you know, I get
hub, you kind of have

538
00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:59.160
to convince people to work
on a project. And from

539
00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:01.830
day one in working on
this, I knew I had

540
00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:05.040
to have design involvement cause
everything that get hub does

541
00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:08.640
involves design as kind of
a core competency. And so

542
00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:12.270
I had to talk basically
a designer into, you know,

543
00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:14.730
turning off his Mac and
turning on a windows computer

544
00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:18.570
and hacking on this with
me and the WPF and

545
00:28:18.570 --> 00:28:21.990
the Metro UI sold it
100%. I had an afternoon

546
00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:25.560
of demonstrating actually some windows
phone apps and the Zune

547
00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:27.720
app and, and some other
Metro twit and some other

548
00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:30.540
things. And I had them
sold and he was off,

549
00:28:30.570 --> 00:28:32.640
he had his grid system
set up and he was

550
00:28:32.670 --> 00:28:35.970
just in love with the,
you know, the topography and

551
00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:39.450
the layout and, and his
ability to basically conceive anything

552
00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:41.880
design-wise and I would say,
Oh, sure, absolutely. I can

553
00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:45.950
do that. That's no problem.
Seriously. This is like some

554
00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:49.820
kind of anti-matter type of
a situation here where one

555
00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:53.180
of us is going to
explode because it is extremely

556
00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:56.230
weird because I can only
assume that's all right. I

557
00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:58.820
can only assume that those
are extremely uncomfortable conversations. And

558
00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:00.830
there are those that are
simply closed minded and like

559
00:29:01.370 --> 00:29:04.070
Metro sucks, Metro, all the
things, you know, we're screwing

560
00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:05.570
up and they're screwing up
and everyone's, you know, I

561
00:29:05.570 --> 00:29:08.690
mean, there's a lot to,
there's a lot of emotional

562
00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:12.200
baggage between windows, people in
Mac people. So it's always

563
00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:15.050
nice when they just kind
of get together and make

564
00:29:15.050 --> 00:29:18.740
something pretty Well. And, and
if you'll notice the Metro

565
00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:21.350
style, we came up with
our own style, get hub

566
00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:24.680
default avatars. If, if your
email address doesn't have an

567
00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:27.530
avatar, or if your org
email address doesn't have an

568
00:29:27.530 --> 00:29:29.900
avatar, there's a set of
default ones in the application.

569
00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:34.790
And those actually, I think
they got slightly tweaked, but

570
00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:38.720
have been adopted on github.com
proper because they were, everybody

571
00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:40.880
likes them so much. So,
you know, it's interesting that

572
00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:43.330
you, that because there's, There
is a, there's a very

573
00:29:43.330 --> 00:29:48.550
significant style and there's some
very specific, very subtle things

574
00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:52.420
about get hugged and then
latest the buttons have, have

575
00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:55.480
a kind of a shadow
on them. It's, it's evocative

576
00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:58.570
of Coco and Mac, but
not in a, in an

577
00:29:58.570 --> 00:30:02.590
overt way, but at the
same time, looking at the

578
00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:04.240
GitHub site right here in
front of me on the

579
00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:08.230
screen next to the Metro,
get up for windows. They

580
00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:11.740
don't, they, they, they are,
they are echoes of each

581
00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:13.990
other and they are evocative
each other, but they, they

582
00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:16.780
both kind of stand alone,
but the branding is consistent.

583
00:30:17.130 --> 00:30:19.440
Yup. And we talked a
lot about, we call it,

584
00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:23.640
get hub flavored Metro. So
we didn't totally follow all

585
00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:26.760
of the Metro design principles.
We kind of took some

586
00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:30.270
leeway and some, you know,
made some decisions on our

587
00:30:30.270 --> 00:30:32.610
own, but we really wanted
it to feel like a

588
00:30:32.610 --> 00:30:35.190
coherent part of the product.
We didn't want to develop

589
00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:37.680
something that didn't feel like
getting out. I also thought

590
00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:40.650
it was interesting that you
didn't just slap the GitHub

591
00:30:40.650 --> 00:30:44.130
logo into the upper left
corner, even though it's possible

592
00:30:44.130 --> 00:30:46.650
that you could do that.
Like the, the, your app

593
00:30:46.650 --> 00:30:49.650
is effectively Chrome lists. It
is just a big white

594
00:30:49.650 --> 00:30:54.630
window with just the code.
And, and I wouldn't, you

595
00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:56.010
know, I won't say too
much, but I wouldn't be

596
00:30:56.010 --> 00:31:01.320
surprised. There's, we're really trying
to move towards this Chrome

597
00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:06.540
list direction. Maybe not as
drastically as some Metro apps

598
00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:10.560
go, but this idea of
the content, it was what

599
00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:13.170
matters. Like you've you visit
get hub to look at

600
00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:16.350
your code. You don't visit
it to see our family.

601
00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:20.640
Yeah. The Octa cat or,
And our logo even necessarily.

602
00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:24.450
So, Yeah, I mean, because
ultimately every single screen, every

603
00:31:24.450 --> 00:31:27.750
single interaction doesn't have to
be an advertisement for you

604
00:31:28.290 --> 00:31:31.260
because I'm already using it.
Absolutely. Any, and even the

605
00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:34.800
way the company is structured,
we're not, we don't make

606
00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:37.170
money off of ads in
any form. We are interested

607
00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:39.600
in, you know, if you're
on GitHub, looking at code,

608
00:31:39.630 --> 00:31:41.370
most likely, you know, who
get hub is, and you

609
00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:45.240
know about the brand. So
Yeah, that's really cool. I

610
00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:48.560
really appreciate you guys talking
to me, thank you for,

611
00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:50.370
for doing this and for
bringing us to the community

612
00:31:50.370 --> 00:31:51.990
and where will people be
able to download this stuff?

613
00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:57.000
So everything will be on
windows.github.com and there'll be a

614
00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.370
big blog post. You should
be able to see on

615
00:31:59.370 --> 00:32:02.970
the top of our site.
And that's, that's the place

616
00:32:02.970 --> 00:32:05.090
to go to download the
app one, click down And

617
00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:07.530
I is the cloning windows
button going to appear everywhere

618
00:32:07.530 --> 00:32:10.890
and people will kind of
get it, get it organically.

619
00:32:11.130 --> 00:32:14.160
So if you are running
windows, the, you will, everyone

620
00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:16.560
will have the cologne in
windows button. If you have

621
00:32:16.570 --> 00:32:18.960
installed and run the app.
If you've logged in to

622
00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:21.810
get up for windows, that
button will act as what

623
00:32:21.810 --> 00:32:24.090
it says. It does Clinton
windows. If it doesn't, it

624
00:32:24.090 --> 00:32:27.600
will direct you over to
the download site. So Very

625
00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:29.880
cool. I really appreciate it.
Good to see you, Phil.

626
00:32:30.270 --> 00:32:32.970
You too, Scott, and nice
to meet you, Tim. And

627
00:32:32.970 --> 00:32:35.400
I hope I will see
you. Absolutely. Thank you, Scott.

628
00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:38.670
This has been another episode
of Hanselminutes and we'll see

629
00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:43.730
you again next week. <inaudible>.
